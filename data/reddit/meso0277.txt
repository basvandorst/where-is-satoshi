Yes when it persists for hours I Literally feel like i may go crazy.
So with the exception of micro denervation surgury how did you make it go away? I have used kratom to make it bearable but it has never "gone away".

I have a coworker who doesn't understand it either no matter how much try he keeps saying it is going to crash and whomever created it is going to be gone with everyone's money. Could someone possibly give me an explain like i am 5 version to show him as to why this isn't the case.

I would but the damned doctors took my left ball back in 2010.
Now i see it was all a scheme to prevent me from eating it and getting in on the left ball eating bitcoin extravaganza.

Thank you for the respect, I do still suffer from orchialgia in the right one which if you google it boils down to acute testicular pain lasting more than 3 months. Thankfully this isn't as excruciating as the implosion however it does feel like getting hit in the ball 2-20 times a day for varying lengths of time. Usually it only lasts a minute or two but can last up to an hour or more(those ones make me really cranky). I have learned to deal with it for the most part after all these years. FYI when i first was reading up on this there are actually millions of people out there that share my condition.

My left testicle imploded somehow and was removed, Yes i did say implode it was not a typo.

Thanks I have tried for years to explain bitcoin to my peers and as you said it is complicated and they just don't accept that it can be accepted as currency. They are always saying "it's not real you can't touch it". I just thought maybe Someone could offer a way to explain it differently than I already have.

I didn't know what HODL stood for either but i just assumed it was an acronym for Hold On for Dear Life. Either way Hold on to what you have.

If you have Insurance it's not that bad, It cost me about $1800 back in 2010.

Thank you again.

No Health Insurance covered the cost of my left testicle being removed due to it imploding somehow. The Reddit bet part was me joking about a comment that said in the US it would cost that much for the surgery.

Yes it hurt like a SOB I can't even articulate with words the pain I was in. Just the weight of gravity when I tried standing felt like the Incredible Hulk was squeezing my testicle.

Thanks for the offer but I am going to be greedy here and see if i can get the same offer to eat my other one.

No the cost of surgery to have it removed. I do however have a rider that covers Reddit bets.
