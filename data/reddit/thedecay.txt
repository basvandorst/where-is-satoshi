This is an interesting post I found on this link..
  
I would read it before you talk more about the fundamentals behind the dogecoin inflation rate/ and or the infinite coins idea. There is also one post in particular that I found quite interesting. The infinite coins idea is based of the fact that (as of now) there will be 10K blocks released for ever...its basic. This comment talks about how that will affect inflation.
  
I just checked Dogehouse (the top pool) and their round time is 1 minute. EVEN at one minute per round (ie. 10k per minute), you're still looking at:
10k X 60min X 24h x 365days = 5.25% for the FIRST year. Don't forget, Dogehouse doesn't get every block, so 5.25% is a theoretical maximum unless everyone jumps on one single pool and screws up the entire system.
If that happens, inflation will be the least of our worries.
To put things into perspective, the USD has inflated by 61% in the last 20 years, but that doesn't even include all the torn up notes that need to be replaced (90% of US bills printed each year is JUST for replacement, not inflation). See here:  (paragraph seven).
There will NOT be a crash, as it will take a theoretical minimum of 20 years before the number of Dogecoins double. THEN take into account any lost doges, increased difficulty, reward spread between the pools (as I mentioned initially) and potential increase in demand which drives up the price.
In conclusion, the 100 Billion was never realistically a stable number, because people lose doges all the time. In order to combat currency loss/leakage, increased demand, increased difficulty as well as the threat of machines leaving the currency (which would reduce the security of the currency). I think the current 10k/block endgame is more than adequate.
Bottom line: only panic if you're short-sighted (like most speculative investors), but if you truly believe in the currency then you need to think long-term. The best investors in the world certainly didn't get rich by crapping their collective pants every time there's a tiny dip on a line chart.

It's 10K coins per block (forever). Not 5 billion a year. So where ever 10K a block lands us in one year will be the number. With an increased difficulty, I can't imagine that will be 5 billion a year.

Do you understand how mining works, I should ask?

At the moment, but I think that's the point the OP is trying to make. They're doing something right. They're accessible. Bitcoin? Not so much.

What have you done for bitcoin, personally?

Do you mine?

All currency is a ripoff of some other currency. The first coin currency was a marvel, but it didn't make all the other coin currencies less useful because they "copied." Bitcoin started something, that doesn't mean there will never be a crypto more useful or better suited for the masses. I'm not saying dogecoin is that, but knocking it because it wasn't first isn't seeing the big picture.

Bitcoin has no community. It has a lot of people that have heard about it and/or are interested in it, but not a community as such.

Is anything I said even remotely like trolling?
