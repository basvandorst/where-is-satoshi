No, Satoshi did. Bitcoin has smart contracts.

Yes,  posts frequency increase on the slope change in price i.e. when price  goes up vertically so does the posts number. Similarly, when price is dropping,  posts show up. Peaks don't and shouldn't match up, because the action is  happening on the moves. If you want to match peaks, take the price derivative.

Haven't they been doing this for years?

How would the zeros in the derivative show causality?

That's what Monero is trying to do, and Bitmain just made an ASIC for their PoW anyway. Monero is planning to change their algorithm next month, but it's unclear if this is a winnable battle. 
Also, their ASIC-resistance led to botnet problems: most hash power is controlled by C&amp;C botnets that infected millions of computers. Therefore, it is still not profitable to mine on GPU, as botnets mine at an electricity deficit given that the ones infected are unaware, and now Monero is "centralized" in botnets.
There's no point in Bitcoin playing this cat-and-mouse game if there's no proven solution. The current solution is the best we have.

What do you mean? He clearly states he's referring to DigiCash/ecash, which is a digital cash implementation from the 1990s

What are you talking about? Show me a single source from whatever reasonable period you like that quantitatively shows that Bitcoin's volatility is lower than the volatility of any national currency.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:51:33
The graphs don't lend themselves to being easily interpreted at all, because of the scaling difference. Do you have a quantitative result that accounts for a computed volatility or even just standard deviation? I'll take a look in a bit too, but I have to finish something quickly.
Edit: According to [this source]( over the past 52 weeks, BTC/USD displayed a volatility of 52.73% and ZAR/USD displayed a volatility of 1.39%.

If everyone prunes their blockchain, you lose the history. You want as many people as possible to be able to host the entire history in order to serve it to new nodes and secure the network through redundancy.

Thanks for your perspective; that's really helpful!
In regards to using Bitcoin in Africa, although it may not be very helpful for the regular citizens, I noticed it's been claimed to be useful for international payments from people who run startups in Africa: 
Do you have any thoughts on this?
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:47:19
Is there a reliable resource that summarises all these Bitcoin-related use-cases/developments/issues in Africa?

For transactions? Pragmatically, why would they use Bitcoin for transactions instead of Visa?
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:34:27
But the vast majority of people acquire BTC from a KYC-regulated exchange such as Coinbase where you do have to provide this information, including a photo of your ID. If Coinbase were hacked, transaction analysis tools would trace much of the data where the user did not go out of their way to hide it. Further,  you can use a debit card without exposing SS/credit score/DoB, and vendors may ask for personal data regardless of your preferred method of payment. I don't think privacy is a problem that's solved by Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:13:02


That's not a scalable solution at all.

Does it? It seems that [one of the most volatile currencies in Africa is the Zambian Kwacha]( and it shows a volatility of [0.68%]( in the last 90 days while BTC shows a volatility of [6.09%]( for the same period. What African currency has a higher volatility than Bitcoin?

You'd enter the market at this point to short something that's already down 70%? Rockefeller manage a VC arm, and they partnered with Coinfund to fund blockchain projects. I don't know what Soros is up to though.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:47:07
I didn't arbitrarily chose 90 days, I chose the data that I found most handy and seemed somewhat reasonable. You're free to quote a longer period that shows contradictory results?
Edit: Checked a different source for past 52 weeks [here](
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:33:53
Why would you send over $40,000 to [this]( 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:13:04
Alternatively, you don't know what words mean.

What about when there are no more block rewards and opening/closing channels is not a frequent necessity anymore?
Edit: To answer my own question, I guess the base layer will continue to be used to settle very large sums as it will probably cost more to transact $1M on LN that on first layer.
