Hi, yes. Never used it before though.
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:06:59
All that gear and you have ladders...��
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:30:50
Thank you kindly sir.
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:43:17
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:59:05
Depends what country, how much you have and what gains you've made. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 09:31:57
Legendary.

BCH is the naked swimmer. You should probably explain what you mean for the cheap seats..
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:00:43
And yet here we are, up at $6700. No-one knows. Whilst sentiment may seem we are continuing down, you never know. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:35:15
Yawn indeed. Everyone's not falling for it anymore. I'm glad. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:28:42
Am I missing something... If the price is locked to the dollar. How does he expect to make 1 trillion? By holding a trillion tokens, then releasing 200 billion, punter's buy, then he dumps the trillion? Fool proof plan... /S. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:07:57
Is 6700 higher than 6400? On this. I am not excited nor depressed. I read this but wouldn't consider myself an 'r/bitcoiner'. I'm doing the same thing you are. Expressing my view, you took it ad hominem. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:30:39
We've all been there.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:05:19
He's a nutter. Never going to happen.

They're parasols, thicker and not waterproof. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:29:21
Bang on mate. Backwards - once the king ficks off with his billions, it's over. They'll rip each other apart.

Yes. And 110 people agreed with me. Thought a bit of positivity about a negative occurrence may make a few people smile on a red day. Away with your saltyness. �� I'm guessing you bought your BTC on December the 14th 2017. ��
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:09:19
Yep. Will do. ��
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:39:39
Will do. I'm going to sell all this afternoon at 3pm GMT. So it should trigger a bull run. ��
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:04:34
Exactly. I am that guy. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:32:40
Agreed 
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:15:09
Fair points, don't know mate. Seems fishy to me too. I can't see who or why they are selling. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:23:46
It was $3000 last year. Don't be wet. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:31:06
It is a game. And one you don't even see you are playing. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:01:54
Buying BTC with a credit card is like paying for a liver transplant with your heart. Don't do it. If you can't afford it, don't buy it. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:27:14
Good news ��
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:01:06
Patience is always the best. When it's hype and fomo. Time to part. After the five year point. That's how real wealth is made. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:18:12
Maybe they were on holiday in Italy, looking at the leaning tower of Pisa.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:42:04
Depends how much you put in and when of course, don't be silly. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:32:09
Just feel like it is large holding day traders ramping it up to collect daily profits now. Most that had weak hands have been shaken off. We're now waiting for the institutional money to accumulate gradually and then signal the next wave up. Then the cream will be skimmed off the top and the cycle will start again. Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:40:05
Insert facepalm with nonsymptathy emoji. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:35:07
I suppose it maybe the psychology that; once we are stopped being told it is dropping and we have a steady amount of sideways, people will be more susceptible to believe that a bull run is coming. Questions are - how long until will gain traction sideways? Then how long sideways until bull run. 2019? 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:40:41
Seriously though, stay focused - this rodeo is not over yet. HODL.

Thanks for sharing. Nothing in UK I have seen apart from libra.

Wait for wave 5 down first junior. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:23:46
Google should be so proud. Such accuracy, such quality.
@_date: 2019-02-16 10:06:19
It's great. I do worry for Andrew Yang's safety. He talks too much sense. He's a threat to the status quo. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:21:00
Okay. When is the debt jubilee going to be held?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:34:04
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:22:29
I'm waiting for the mainstream news...

Are you a Nigerian Prince?

If I had the $ to shake the tree, I'd be doing it. Sadly, I have no more to invest. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 05:27:18
It's got nothing to do with Blockchain. A company has held your money (you prove it) you show what reasonable steps you have taken to get it back (evidence) you want him to write to (address found in internet - email/post) he will advise them what happens if you don't get it back. 
End of. I'm not bothering my sister in Bali, at this hour. A lawyer/solicitor will know what to do. Just go get on with it. 
Good luck. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:21:13
Before you go there, I don't want a nude 'pick' either...

Vampire bots en route...
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:20:06
No thanks. You said you can't draw. If I want an unaccomplished picture, I'll ask my 5 year old to draw something. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 05:19:41
Go see a lawyer. Agree a fee, pay it. Get your money back. Don't try and do it yourself. Because if they know you're trying to blag it, it won't work. Needs to be legit. Good luck. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 10:04:35
Well it worked in her case. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:12:33
Wow. Sell something, but not yourself. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 04:55:41
My sister had to get a lawyer to write to the officially and she got her $ back. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:51:21
Will it? won't it? Don't let them play with your emotions. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:17:01
Problem with this guy's. You're asking for a lot of info' from people potentially holding $10k +. Id rather not disclose the kind of info you want. It would sure make it easier for you to hack me. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:15:13
Never give up. But you are right, my hair is going grey and I didn't become rich. However, one year in the markets is like 2 minutes in life. Be patient. That is how to transfer wealth to yourself. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:59:11
Buy in then. ��

Grow the hell up. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:46:37
How convenient
@_date: 2018-07-12 09:16:13
That is when it is most apparent. �� Have faith and patience. The bulls are coming. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:52:31
They always do. If you can't hack it. Sell and leave the market. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:29:04
During this last market cycle, I've learned why it is actually better to take profits. It is hard to time the market but consider that even a week either way at Xmas 2017, if I had taken profits, I would have had nearly a 5x to buy in now in terms of purchase power. I didn't, I hodl watching them bleed out - being that guy that knows the moment I sell, a gigantic bull run will leave me left behind and bereft of the patience and position I have now. Now I hold, next time I sell. It serves me right for having a bad strategy. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:56:06
Yes. I stand corrected. �� Not had coffee yet. ��

Good one. Here's my personal data.... SCAMMY Fudge piece
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:13:10
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:56:09
Because you're asking for phone numbers... Plus 4 week old account. If you want to give me 100$ of BTC. Here's my wallet address, I'll vouch for you. Happy birthday btw.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:08:36
I'm just interested what makes you think it will. I'm always tired. ��
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:37:10
Wow. No.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:23:42
Thank you. Good explanation. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:01:14
What makes you think it will even see $20k again..
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:13:59

Outrageous predictions. Where have they gone?
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:44:54
The predictions were removed.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:00:55
Because they bought 30 BTC in February. And just sold.. Or they robbed Binance... ��
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:54:07
Or.... Bitcoin ends for some unknown reason and another takes its place... So many possibilities.
