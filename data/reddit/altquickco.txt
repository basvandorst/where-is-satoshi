Once had a big bounced check come in while selling, and released the BTC prematurely. Thankfully I was able to track down the scammer and got my BTC back!
Also even earlier in the business, a fake receipt came in and the BTC were released. There was location data left in the image so finding the scammer was relatively simple. They ended up making a legitimate deposit, and then became a repeat customer! :)
Thankfully nobody has ever walked away with the BTC!

Here is actually a great article that explains how I got started: 
tl;dr I was trading off the volatility in May, 2013 but was scammed a number of times while trying to make P2P trades. I decided there needed to be a safer system, so I launched my own P2P platform in August, 2013:)

We only accept cash deposits at this time! As we move to other payment methods, we will implement various measures to ensure accounts are not stolen. These include, but are not limited to, collecting ID, verifying phone number, etc.

Thanks, appreciate the support!
Honestly, I think regulation could be an issue for some startups and slow the growth of the ecosystem. Hopefully more states don't go the way of New York; we will likely be discontinuing service in New York shortly. It's not reasonable for startups to spend $5,000+ on an application, when every dollar (or bit!) counts. We're already spending enough on federal compliance, lets not double the burden!
As for my inspiration, I started BitQuick as a side project while studying Biomedical Engineering at Ohio State to make P2P trading more streamlined, safe and quick. As time went on, I became increasingly fascinated by Bitcoin itself, and its various applications.
After attending Boost.VC earlier this year though, and graduating from OSU, I really took the dive into the business. P2P platforms will play a major role in facilitating Bitcoin's growth in underbanked , cash based communities. By providing consumer protections, we enable even those who are relatively new to Bitcoin to still have a safe, easy way to get into the space.

We're working to smooth out the UI, but ideally there should be no need for you to directly communicate with support, except in the case of a dispute.
We'll soon allow confirmation of deposits to happen on the website, but most sellers prefer to receive an email notification upon deposit as well. We also [integrated Clef]( to replace PINs. 
Hope you can give us another try, we're a lot smoother than we once were!

Coinbase has certain policies and procedures they have set in place so that they can comply with various regulations involved with their specific business. 
If you want privacy with regard to how you spend your Bitcoin, simply sending them to a temporary Bitcoin wallet will provide you with a reasonable level of privacy.

Definitely join the Bitcoin Group for one!  There's also a Bitcoin ATM around Columbus: 
I'd also join Open Source Club. As for classes, I was a BME so I can't recommend much for CSE. What I can say is get your tough classes out of the way so you can focus on internships, projects and research in your later years. Also when you are working, work hard and when you are taking a break, make sure you're taking a break. Mixing the two is the worst.
I got involved in Bitcoin just because I spend a lot of time on the net. I was originally just trading cryptos for their volatility, but I discovered that Bitcoin was much more than a volatile asset. 
Check out  for different Bitcoin related jobs and whatnot. You can always go the startup route though. Pick a problem, solve it, apply to an accelerator, and come out to the Silicon Valley!

Always have more on the horizon!
Specifically though we are rolling out SMS verification for buy orders soon, which should reduce the amount of coins tied up in unpaid holds, and increase liquidity!
The ShapeShift.io integration also allows for increased liquidity:

Awesome to say the least. Adam is a super passionate dude, and really stays involves and available for his startups. He tries hard to get the best connections for his companies, and is really trying to grow this space. After going through the Boost program and seeing them from the inside, I couldn't possibly be a bigger fan of what they are doing for the ecosystem. Adam is definitely staying a few years ahead of all his competitors!

We shut it down on account of low volume, and an irrational fear of ISIS using it to fund terrorism. Wasn't worth the fuss, so we're going to wait some time before going back to the Middle East.

In the Bitcoin space, I'm really excited about these growing remittance platforms.  I think FIAT&lt;--&gt; FIAT will come shortly. BitQuick has plans to provide streamlined remittances to India shortly as well.
I'm also intrigued by OpenBazaar. Getting VC backed is a huge milestone for them, and a big win for the entire space.

You have to physically go to the bank or credit union to pay for your order at this point. This ensures an irreversible payment (cash) and quick order processing on the flip side.

We are registered as an MSB and perform KYC/AML on all customers. Personally, I think it is a necessary evil but that regulations should be made in the context of the industry they are being made for. Overbearing regulation stifles innovation.

Some sellers have had their accounts closed, but there are different factors each time. Can't pinpoint the exact problem. All we do know is many banks don't particularly like Bitcoin customers. Our transactions look like regular cash deposits though, so it is difficult to distinguish from a non-Bitcoin transaction.
