What are you talkong about. You can send it to any Bitcoin address.

Because when something needs to adapt or upgrade it typically needs to be discussed, or a solution be found.  Wouldn't it be great if everything magically was perfect all the time, and when it wasnt it made itself correct.

Theoretically possible to win the lottery back to back 10 times in a row. Theoretically possible isn't feasible

Fedcoin. Yeah. Sounds like something everyone will jump on.  Memo 1. Just because people trust the government doesnt make them want to support a brand that represents a stranglehold on society. Retarted.

Credit and currency are two different things. People basically refer to Visa as card payment or easy dogotal tranaction on here... acquiring credit and spending owned bitcoin are quite different. 
Also, "most people" is a very subjective approach wothout numbers to back it up.  I shut out any debate with that or similar, basically reflects a personal bias.

Please don't be mislead into believing that the number of reddit Bitcoiners subscribed to r/bitcoin is the "bitcoin community". My account is not subscribed, been here for years, and there is a lot more that have been un subbing lately  This is a representation of people on reddit who talk Bitcoin, not to mention i would also suggest there are a numbrr of single users here that have 2+ accounts.

If you are going to share what is a rather bullshitty article about a technology that actually reduces card present fraud nearly 80% from the stats of other nations migrations, at least say what it has to do with anything..

The downvote system ia just doing its job, which would suggest that people in here do not agree with the comments that have been downvoted to oblivion. If they were upvoted, people would be agreeing. But they are not
 It is not the systems fault for doing its job.

Bitcoin adapts by diacussion, debate and open conversation.  One person is filtering and adding bias to the conversation by removing and banning people for theor opinion. He ia theymos and he ia in charge here and bitcointalk. His refusal to let things take their course and let consensus be arrived at through healthy debate is negative.

Dude. They are kyc aml compliant. Fucking answer the simple questions and move along. I hate it when people say "i am using your services but the arent perfect for me , myself,  and i so your business is bad for btc, change it". If you dont like what Coinbase is offering you, why the fuck do you still have an account? Why are you on  here bitching.  
Why dont you end your relationship with them and put your Bitcoin in a service that appeals to your needs. There is hundreds and hundreds of wallets now,  go get one you like instead of.putting your time into whining about shit that is completly 100% put of your reach

Any .com web domain can be a premium domain. I hate when people use that as a selling point.
