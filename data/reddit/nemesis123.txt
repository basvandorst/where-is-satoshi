Comparing Bitcoin to Email is a nice example too. Nobody owns email.

People still feel alienated to Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin and every other coin is a revolution. We can change the way payments take place, remove the corrupt middlemen. We need to focus more on improving conditions.
What I've noticed here is that people consider Bitcoin an investment, and eventually go back to USD cause they get more fiat. 
No matter how much fiat you get, you will never live a rich life like this. You'll be wealthy, but not rich. Missing out on life's pleasures so that you can buy warehouses, stuff them with ASIC's, make safe houses for your Bitcoin for cold storage. 
Please treat Bitcoin as a currency. Spend it. Unless you don't spend, how can you expect vendors to accept it? And if they don't use Bitcoin, how do you expect it's value to grow?

There are people constantly posting the "Get 0.o2 Bitcoin" links.
