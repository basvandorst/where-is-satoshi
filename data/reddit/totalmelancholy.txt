If the problem is that you mistyped your password when you set it, that should be fairly easy to crack. There are probably dozens of scripts out there that change characters one-by-one. Try googling, if you can't find one I can whip something up for you
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:48:33
check your email for "account creation" emails, which most websites autosend when you make an account. 
Go to a bunch of popular exchanges and use the "forgot password" option and see if your email is registered to an account for that exchange
That's all I got.

someone claimed it. what was the solution?
@_date: 2016-08-31 00:38:31
Do you have any information on your password that you remember? was it dictionary words or random characters? how many words/characters? letters only or numbers and symbols too? do you remember any part of it?

“nice try, but i see you post to T_D and that invalidates literally everything you say”
I disagree with what he’s saying and think he is ignorant about bitcoin, but his participation in another subreddit doesn’t automatically disqualify his opinions.

sorry for the late response. My reasoning would be because of the increased difficulty for blocks, the price of the equipment needed to mine, and the cost of power to power the "super computer". People *can* argue this and say it's still worth it in the long run. ok, it might be, but I don't think it is
as for "right now", that's just because we don't really know what the future holds. for all we know it will only become increasingly difficult, or maybe the hash rates of new computers gets a lot better to the point where a good mining computer will be easier to afford

i guess it matters on how you plan on using your bitcoin. spending, trading, and storing away from long term will have different needs.
for instance, storing it away for long term will require a method of cold storage, possibly a paper wallet.
if you want to day trade (which i don't recommend since its easy to lose money even if youre a professional) you could just keep it on an exchange since you'd be trading it around anyway
for normal use such as spending or just short term storage, multibit, electrum, mycelium are all good choices.

trading is difficult for inexperienced traders and you will almost definitely lose all the money you try to trade with. 
that being said, do some solid research on trading; find some reading via google search. then take a SMALL AMOUNT of bitcoin to an altcoin exchange like bittrex and trade around the altcoins to get some hands on learning. 
that's how i learned, but i've since stopped since it wasnt really my cup of tea. i made a couple bitcoin from almost nothing but it was too risky i didnt like it. i wouldve made more but i made some bad trades/investments

If you do nothing (HODL), you risk not being able to increase your holdings. You also risk losing *fiat* value if the price only decreases without increasing for a while. The benefit is that you won't lose any *bitcoin*
If you sell and try to buy back, you risk losing bitcoin (but not fiat) if the price doesn't dip and you have to buy back higher. The benefit is that you can increase your bitcoin holdings regardless of where the price goes after a dip.

I'm about 50/50 BTC/ALTS
Right now i make $3-4 profit per day mining and staking altcoins. not much but its fun.
One altcoin i really like isn't meant to be a currency at all, its meant as a verification system to verify files and identities. i like that people are using blockchain technology for more than just currency.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:21:09
opened at 1050, closed at 960. decent profit

you blinked, just hit 970
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:14:23
no, the ETF decision killed the momentum bitcoin had, combined with rising too much too quickly it double topped and now its a bear market. The dispute regarding BU may contribute a little but its by no means the main factor.
We'll likely see intermittent spikes on a downtrend towards $700 and then level out for a while around $750 
edit: don't downvote just because you don't like the thought of the price dropping. Obviously i can't see the future, this is just my prediction.

But that doesn't matter for shit if I don't know what it can buy; it means nothing. Currency needs value to have meaning. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:53:36
you are correct. For example, set various sells between 1250-1350, buy from 1200-1250 which triggers stop buys that end up buying your higher sells, then sell the coins you just bought on any limit orders placed in the mean time. Mad profit.
Bonus points if you set low buy orders to get filled if people panic dump.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:39:39
I don't know for sure but that's my best guess. and I'm very impressed with the traders who took advantage of it. 
I personally don't think it's insider trading, insiders would be smarter about it and less conspicuous IMO
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:24:09

@_date: 2017-03-10 15:01:33
Would you pay for such a thing? Creating a bot just for stop-loss orders would be easy. I could whip something up if you're interested. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:53:34
you're example is correct but your first statement is not. the coins aren't "almost destroyed" or "regenerated". When I block is mined, you can basically think of it as "Hey miner, this block you found had 12.5 BTC. And look, all these transactions being sent have a total fee of 1 BTC. Here is your reward of 13.5 BTC for your work!"
does that help? It's kind of like sales tax. An item might cost $4.99 but I might have to pay $5.35. The store only gets $4.99 and the remaining $0.36 is given to the state as a tax (aka fee)

Ah, good work man. Sounds like I was on the right track before I gave up
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:48:59
The simplest answer is the reward for mining a block gets cut in half (this halving will drop the reward from 25 BTC to 12.5) and people typically expect the fiat exchange rate to rise to compensate miners who will now be earning half as much as they were before
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:49:27
not sure what loss you're talking about. I'm not in the red at all. i also don't really buy, i just hodl bitcoin and trade/mine/stake altcoins
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:45:13
well, we will be long gone by then since that's over 120 years from now.
but as the block rewards decrease, miners will become much more dependent on fees

this is an important point. If someone doesn't already have a bank account imagine how difficult it would seem:
*I had to wait for someone to be available to help me at the bank. Then I had to sit with them for 30 minutes filling out all kinds of forms. And if I don't deposit $200 right now I either can't open the account or I have to pay a fee! Ugh now I have to wait for my ATM card to be made*
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:42:41
its not bypassing some kind of security or gaining access to something you shouldnt, it was a loophole in the way a recursive (self-calling) function behaved. by definition its not a hack
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:20:31
The biggest issue being it wasnt actually a hack. Someone just exploited a loophole in the existing code, which is why its so controversial: Should there really be a fork/rollback just because there was a mistake in the code and someone took advantage of it
That being said, OP's analogy is bad
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:46:37
In your example you use a centralized system whereas the majority of cryptocurrencies (and tokens) are designed to be decentralized. If the ETH or DAO devs hardfork/rollback to reverse the damage, that too becomes a centralized system because a single entity or group of entities are deciding what is and isnt allowed, and who gets to own coins and when. It sets a precedent.
In either scenario, things don't look good
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:19:57
wow its crazy how similar that is! Like the other poster said, i doubt the bear market is over yet. the last one lasted two years and this ones only been ~6 months.
However i’d love to be wrong, as “Disbelief” would probably put it somewhere around 11-12k.
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:30:25

@_date: 2019-08-10 23:22:58
bitcoin is much more established, has a much longer history, and many more users with more transactions, nodes, volume etc. 
This means much less risk than an alt that popped up in past year or two that is still working on building up all of these factors.
not to mention the vast number of alts that are made solely as scams or money farms. 2015-2017 was a wiiild time for alts
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:06:34

let me introduce you to my friend Margin
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:41:06
it’s not a myth, it’s just not the most efficient way to profit from an investment. Obviously the most effective way would be to buy the bottom of every dip and sell the top of every peak. 
DCA is low effort, doesn’t require timing, and is typically low(er) risk for long term investments. but it won’t profit as much as good timing in trading or going all-in at a low point and holding long term.
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:57:12
If you don’t already have a lot of trading experience, stay away from margin. Even with trading experience it’s easy to get rekt. you can be careful and smart and still get burned by stop hunts, random barts, and slow bleed from leverage rates. Bots are relentless
that being said, you can also make a lot of money. the best way to learn is by doing. find a sandbox exchange (I think bitmex offers trading on a testnet?) or risk a little real “play” money you’re prepared to lose, because you will lose at first.

not really, there were a bunch of coins that had almost no volume, updates, etc. in a loong time (aka they were dead and exchanges were likely delisting them soon) and people pumped them just for the sake of making money. it started a chain reaction and suddenly a ton of alts were being pumped. a few had real reasons, but those didn't pump nearly as much, besides LTC that is.

@_date: 2018-07-08 21:01:54
the block reward gets cut in half (meaning new bitcoin is only generated half as fast). the price may or may not be effected (although historically the price has gone up after the halving). This may or may not be a good thing depending on who you are and what you want, but also because it can create another bubble like the last two halvings which is followed by a long recovery.
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:54:17

@_date: 2017-05-25 03:03:14
the key to trading altcoins is to set targets of 10-15% profit after buying into an altcoin instead of the x00% people try to chase. 10% is very easy during a bull market like this and its fairly low risk. 
it doesnt sound like much but consistent +10% trades add up  very quickly! diversify, rinse and repeat and you're pretty much sitting on a money tree.
Bear market is much different though. I hardly ever traded during the last bear market

is that how you think this works? reward halves and then everyone suddenly wants to buy more bitcoin?
the price already climbed from $400 to nearly $800 (before dipping and settling around $630-660) in the last couple months due to hype for the upcoming halving
in the upcoming months as miners drop out due to costs, difficulty, profitability etc. we might see a continuing increase in price to keep incentive for miners to stay. 
we could see $1000+...or we could see the price crash...or it might hover around these levels for a while. strap in for the ride

@_date: 2016-07-12 01:52:01
exactly. so if demand remains the same, and supply continues to grow, albeit slower than before, there's no reason for price to rise.
price only rises when demand overtakes supply (whether it be from demand increase or supply decreasing) and since supply doesnt decrease (ignoring lost coins) then the only thing that will make the price rise is an increase in demand
