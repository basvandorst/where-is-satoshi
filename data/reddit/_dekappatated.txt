Maybe, but I doubt it, at least at first.  Easier to use existing crypto and outsource all the complexity.  What are they gonna do is someone facebook account is hacked and they transfer off the crypto? If its third party, they can put their hands up in the air.  If its their own coin, then what are they gonna do?  I feel like they would have more responsibility that way, and have to come up with a much more complex system.  I think the way they integrate will try to keep it as separated as possible to reduce liability. Maybe I'm wrong or someone else can add their opinion?

Plus its pretty and rare.  The whole reason humans are attracted to it.   Completely unrelated, but I really like the whole gold/space aesthetic:
Let me see you cover a space craft in bitcoin /s

Bullshit, as a dev that's tried this, its not easy at all.  Trying to build everything and set everything up is an absolute nightmare.   Worse than any corporate dev environments I've ever dealt with by far. Setting up all the dependencies to compile is a mess.

Thanks for the reply. It does bother me that there are so many alts coming out that have Bitcoin in the name, it seems like it will devalue the name and confuse newbies. But I also am not sure about how I feel about the devs on core, they seem very slow at responding to fixes and backed out on segwit at the last second. And how much longer until they fix tx fees. All these merchant s are backing out from accept in btc because no one wants to pay 20 dollarsin fees for a 50 dollar item. The devs team needs to really move a lot faster or btc us gonna get left behind.

Maybe this seems obvious,but I thought the hype around when bitcoin first hit 1k was comparable to now.  Apparently not.  Its at least 5 fold greater interest.

Agreed, this network slowing shit is gonna bring it down.

The second any of those coins move it will be the apocalypse for btc.

What does bcash represent besides bigger blocks and faster block times. Geniunely curious. What makes Bitcoin better? Can I get a real answer and not just downvoted because I really wanna know.

There are other ways to get rich off blockchain besides being a coin holder.  Block chain is being used to develop all types of applications now a days not just crypto.

Not at all, though maybe some ETH.

Make a coinbase account and make sure its fully set up with your bank info, etc.  Then I'd sell some test BTC, like 20 bucks worth or something.

Can Zimbabwean people not open bank accounts in other countries and wire the money there?
