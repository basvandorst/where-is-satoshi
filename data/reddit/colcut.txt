I called up my bank to get my details so i could verify my bank account
Iban and bic whatever.
Then i sent 50 euro to coinbazw to get that verified.
Im yet to withdraw gbp. But i assume its easy

Try using your phone to do the ID verification.
But then put it onto gdax and buy using limit orders. No fees

Looks like they can and just did.

You are delusional if you think you are intelligent after admitting to doing something completely brainless like storing money on someone else's servers.
The entire point of bitcoin is to take control away from third parties.

Anyone that stores large amounts of btc/usd in these sites deserves to lose it. 
You must be a complete idiot to trust someone else to secure their systems.
In before comparison to real would banks

I've been into btc for many years - pretty much since its inception, and people have ALWAYS been saying "bitcoin is dead".
Dead for X reason 
x= Some country announces theyre trying to ban it; alt coins are "better"; mtgox has died; "satoshi" is dead.....the list could go on forever

1 KWH Is 18p where I live in the UK which is about $0.24. Sucks to be British sometimes (read most of the time)

I don't even think you can profit from mining on this card.

Send them details provided in the bitcoin client.
Double click a transaction that you have had with mtgox and it will pop up this:
Status: xxx confirmations
Date: &lt;timestamp&gt;
To: &lt;addr&gt;
Debit: -xx.xx
Net amount: -xx.xx
I did this and they approved my account after 2 rejections.
@_date: 2011-06-24 10:36:40
I got rejected as well even though I gave the last IP I used.
If you are not going to accept IP addresses as proof why bother even listing it as proof?
edit: admittedly I am in a different country at the moment and I may or may not have used the right VPN to connect to the site - is this the reason why?

I'm shocked in learning someone actually visits the ads.  
Then again if he couldn't work out how to make a wallet normally it sounds like his computer skills are near zero

Well given that one person on the forum spammed this url in like 4 threads, I'm not really convinced it's true.
I would love to buy some asci devices, I know it doesn't cost that much to make them, assuming the company is real, they are going to make some right profit from people at those prices.
@_date: 2011-07-03 00:28:30
Reminds me of all those stupid 'Anonymous is legion' videos.
@_date: 2011-06-24 11:01:09
I just submitted again, but it only said 'last used IP' is submitted even though I just typed out loads of crap in the last balence section.
Can you check if you got it? same user name as here.
@_date: 2011-06-29 00:41:32
There's a guy that posts here named mtgox_adam that may reply to this thread, try pming him on here, or do as others have suggested and go on irc.
