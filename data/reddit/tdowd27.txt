Coinbase essentially has no customer service, fucks up identification like it’s their goddamn job, “goes down” when the markets crash, refuses to implement segwit, etc, etc.
It’s not the customers, Coinbase just fucking sucks.

An ad hominem is when someone focuses his argument on a person rather than said person’s argument or object being debated. The post does not make much of an argument, however, the argument that it does make—that BCH is trash—is not ... wait, you just responded to me saying it’s not an ad hominem... with an ad hominem!

This is why I take bone broth each and everyday. I’m redder than ever, and let me tell you ladies and gentleman, it has allowed me to expose these pedofiles disguised by the fed who are turning these frogs gay.

I’m not OP. But yeah, I agree, he should probably wait a bit to at least sell most of them.

I remember hearing about it on Joe Rogan and being blown away. I’ve known far too many guys who have suffered from PTSD and have little to no ability to combat it. Best of luck to you getting in a study, bro!

Oh comon! You’ll need at least a $20 pipe wrench to take my ass down.

Haven’t actually been buying BTC lately (been focusing on alt coins), but I keep seeing pictures of transactions where someone goes to buy $20 or $30 and gets a $30 or so fee.

Uh-oh, do we have a “that wasn’t true communism” guy here? Not sure why a communist would be in favor of Bitcoin, a coin that was built on the idea of decentralization.
Edit: now that i reread what you said, I think it might be sarcasm. If so, you should use /s in the future

What are your plans for liquidation and long term holdings (not hodling)? Are you going to sell them as you need the money, liquidate a portion or all and put in something thats more stable like the S&amp;P?

Hahahaha Merry Christmas, bro!

I don’t think he’s saying he can’t trust them (in a “they might steal” kind of way), but, a lot of times when someone has money in a family that isn’t wealthy things can get tricky. A sister might ask for a loan to start something you don’t think will be profitable. A brother might ask for some money to buy something he thinks he needs but you don’t. When you say no to requests like that, it often times causes tension. 
The vast majority of people in this world have no problem taking a large gift that they didn’t work for; considering the family aspect, people often times look at these requests closer to asking for a gift rather than begging for money. You may be different yourself, but considering we can’t chose our family, I doubt everyone in your family is different as well.

Tell her to tell all her friends that you created Bitcoin Cash so they understand why you weren’t able to afford any presents this year.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:37:27
It’s called BITCOIN CASH, call it by it’s real name!!!

Was about to go and link articles/posts I’ve read about outrageous fees, but, that’s unneccesary; $7 for $200 is not a model that works as an actual currency. Everytime you buy something, you have to spend an extra 3.5%. And you think that’s going to allow Bitcoin to thrive as a currency? Seriously? I doubt we’ll see the number of people buying BTC go down anytime soon, so that means that percentage will only rise without change.
You can write petty comments about me bending facts to fit my narrative all you want, but that won’t change Bitcoin from being looked at strictly as an investment as opposed to a viable currency. Only realizing there is a problem and fixing said problem can do that.

It’s been a while for me too. However, I believe he was supposed to be a rebel against the authoritarian regime. Because the citizens were so brainwashed, they saw any opposition to the government as evil, though.  
Towards the end it may be revealed that Goldstein was actually the government’s creation so that there would be a common enemy, thereby inciting unity. 
Edit: Now that I look back I realize what point you were trying to make. I don’t know too much about the guy, but, after watching an interview of him flipping out over the interviewer calling it “bcash” and saying that he was a self-made millionaire, therefore, he should essentially not be questioned  etc etc, he kind of seems like a cunt.

Not an ad hominem. His sentence about Ver wasn’t a part of his argument that BCH is a shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:01:57
Not going to pretend like I know nearly as much as him, but when fees are becoming more than the amount bought or spent in many cases, the problem spans beyond the community. Honestly not sure how that can be fixed, but for Christ sake, don’t act like everything else is perfect when it’s not.

@_date: 2017-12-12 23:13:15
Wouldn’t that imply that we ought to be on Ver’s side, as opposed to hating him?

New to bitcoin and still in the researching process...
Does it usually start going down Friday night and then go down until monday morning? Or how does it usually work?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:11:33
New to Bitcoin, so forgive me if I come off as ignorant...
But, wouldn’t the vast majority of people here love a drastic price drop? Unless you were planning on selling your BTC during that crash, it would allow everyone to buy in low. And from what I’ve seen Bitcoin is truly incredible at rebounding.
