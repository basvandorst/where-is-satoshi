I used changetip. Worked for me perfectly.

Montana has a strong anti government mentality, and lots of people here would love to purchase their firearms and firearm accessories without their banks necessarily finding out.  When purchasing a firearm from an ffl, a background check is required, so uncle Sam does know you bought a gun. However, you only report of its a long gun or hand gun.

I'll try to figure out how to use it on his website. Then it'll be available to anyone in a free country.

You must be British. Still sore about that whole revolution thing?
@_date: 2015-09-16 16:14:44
Who said that? All laws are being followed.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:00:56
Hey thanks!

He's got a few in stock.

You didn't? Because I did. Also, Heller vs. DC decided it was an individual right. 
And as a second note.  Did you look at my username? Of course I'm an active militiaman. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:25:48
There is too much regulation on guns as it is. The government has absolutely no right to restrict any firearm ownership.
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:42:14
I don't know. What would be best?
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:36:11
I'll pass that along! Thanks.
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:12:44
Montana is amazing. Most people forget we exist.
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:37:41
And we're committed by people on psychotropic drugs iirc.

Probably true. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:17:53
Someone did something bad. Better punish everyone! Apparently Australians need a nanny so they don't hurt themselves.
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:59:06
That's better!
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:35:22
I don't know. I can check.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:38:40
well shit, so did I.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:32:31
That makes sense. I like it here.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:05:32
That's cool. How?
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:07:06
You call it an app. Android?

Most people shoot with two hands.

I also said that. I'm not going to argue the personal intent of an internet stranger who is exercising his right whether or not you agree with it. I own a lot of guns for a lot of reasons. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:55:38
I believe was referring to the anti gun crowd that equates guns to crime as a generality. People like that have a tendency to push legislation that infringes on people's freedoms in the name of security and safety.
Those people invite tyranny, and arming yourself against that is not just noble, but one's civic duty as an American. 
Or I'm just happy that there is a new gun owner.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:36:34
I didn't know that sub existed. I'm sorry. I'm new.
@_date: 2015-03-22 16:40:57
The only difference is the level of authority of the condemner.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:57:24
Wow! Thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:06:29
Careful now. We have more cows than horses.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:03:12
Going off your username, I'm guessing you're in California. Good luck with the gun thing. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:02:20
That snide comment won't make you any more intelligent. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:01:41
Congrats! Guns are an amazing, albeit expensive, hobby.
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:53:33
How does northern Alberta get one but not Montana? That's horseshit.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:00:38
While I've never had to opportunity to buy a gun with livestock, this is absolutely true. Even if you're trading one gun for another or picking up *your own* gun in a pawn shop, you still have to fill out form 4473 and pass an NICS check.

I guess that speaks to the security of cryptos, huh?

Who am I to judge? He has caused me no harm, nor anyone else, why should I disagree? What makes me special enough to decide what a person can and cannot do?
@_date: 2015-03-15 06:49:30
I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:04:34
Wow! Thanks man!
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:18:23
Shortly after I purchased. And just today it said my bitcoin wasn't ready to withdraw that I bought with a debit card.
@_date: 2015-03-22 03:42:26
Where's the threat?
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:46:32
I wish I was shady enough to say it was mine. It would be a nice intro to bitcoin for me. But that's just fucked up. Good luck in your search.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:43:48
okay cool. Thanks for your help man.
