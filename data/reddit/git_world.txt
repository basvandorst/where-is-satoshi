@_date: 2019-06-22 07:50:07
You should know where the sky is. It is $100k
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:08:43
why not?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:54:09
Mind to explain?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:57:05
You could report this to google. They should correct it
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:39:56
Tells this and go home to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:52:04
after that 50k.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:50:16
great. Could you please explain the tech to a noob?
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:45:42
Why? To use the currency, one should pay tax?
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:38:37
why not?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:15:42
Still it is one of top 20 list.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:45:53
it's crazy. I don't think Tron deserves to be in top 10.
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:56:20
Just use your common sense or do some reading on your own. Fool
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:56:05
Good for you. I’m sure other coins like IOST or Ethereum can meet similar goals but with better decentralized network. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:47:46
I’m expecting at least 60k + this bull run. Also, I believe this bull run will last a lot longer.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:07:18
the guy on the left was TRON
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:08:44


Who are they?
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:45:22
What do you use it for? I assume you are selling everyday.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:55:28
Who is this guy?
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:50:51
oh, can you robinhood crypto assets? What countries are allowed to use?
Location: Germany.
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:06:41
Isn't the price supposed to go down when mining reward halving happens? Can you explain the gist, please?
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:08:36
What car model is it? Congrats btw
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:43:29
Okay. Why more demand?
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:19:48
Someone please explain the reason behind prices going up.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:31:28
How does this payment work under the hood? AFAIK Amazon still don’t accept bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:08:04
probably he has invested in some sector which gets obsolete if blockchain/bitcoin gains popularity.
