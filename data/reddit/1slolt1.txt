If you don't like the unregulated nature of bitcoin you are free to use another currency.  Why force regulation upon people who don't want it?
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:54:24
I just don't want forced regulation.  Let businesses choose if they want to be regulated (government or private).  Then let consumers choose which businesses they want to deal with.  No threat of violence needed.
Compromise isn't always a good thing.  If a mugger comes up to you and demands all the money in your wallet should you compromise with him and give him half (since you really wanted to give him none)?

And not everyone can understand the English language. What's your point?
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:19:39
Code is just another language.  Why does everyone need to know it? If you don't know it you just need someone you trust to translate for you.

You really think it is worth my time to send them a blank piece of paper as a proposal for Bitcoin regulations?
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:52:03
Those sound like reasonable regulations and it wouldn't be bad for bitcoin businesses to implement those things.  However, I don't like forced government regulation.  
If a business wants to be regulated by a regulatory agency (government or private) that's great.  If not that is their choice as well.  Let the consumer choose who they want to do business with and what type of risks they want to take as well.

TL;DR: I support pointing guns at people to make them do what I think is right.

I wouldn't consider what's happened lately a "slight breeze".  You are dealing with very small companies that never expected to have this much traffic.  If you can't deal with that nobody is forcing you to use those exchanges.

Can someone explain why people use bots on Just-Dice?

The only way a fire department exists is if it's run by the government?  I don't think so...
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:42:26
You could obviously pay for the service on a monthly basis and therefore you wouldn't need your credit card when you called for help.
I suppose you find the government forcing people at gunpoint to fund these services a morally better alternative?  Theft is theft regardless of what the money is used for.  If someone doesn't want police or fire protection that should be their choice.

You are missing my point.  If I tried to purchase a product and all of the companies who sold it were absolutely horrible I would just end up not buying it.  Bitching and moaning while providing no solutions doesn't really help.
Have you sent any helpful suggestions to any of the exchanges?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:12:44
Everything in life is gambling, just with different levels of risk.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:45:14
You realize there are other exchanges right? 
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:22:36
I never asked the government to provide those services for me.  If I mow your lawn without asking can I then demand $500 for it and lock you in a cage if you don't pay?
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:19:12
People who want fire protection service.  Why would it be different than any other service that people purchase?  The government doesn't provide a landscaping service and yet people are willing to purchase such a service.

Great idea.  I'll have to check it out during lunch.

The text messaging didn't work for me but the phone call did.

I can't imagine a situation where someone would legitimately own ALL of the land.  That's just silly.

You were born into your parents house where your dad decided to rape you every night.  If you want to change it follow the system and ask him to stop or move out of your own house at 5 years old.

Believe it or not it's possible to live without using the internet or bitcoins.  Nobody is putting a gun to your head and making you use them.

Then don't fucking use their service.  Jesus fucking Christ I am tired of all the bitching and moaning about Mt. Gox.  There are other exchanges out there to use so go use them.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:38:44
Then stop using their services if they don't perform to your standards.

LOL protection from theft and violence?  Government commits more acts of theft and violence than any other entity. 
Oh, you posses a harmless substance we have deemed illegal, we are going to kick down your door (violence), shoot your dog (violence), physically restrain you (violence) and then take your illegal substance (theft)l
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:46:23
You realize that a "free market" means each actor in the market is FREE to act how they wish.  If Mt. Gox wanted to close its doors forever and just let everyone cash out they would be FREE to do that.

Why don't you create one since it's so easy?
