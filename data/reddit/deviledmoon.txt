I am able to see the coins after doing that but here is the next issue, upon sending those coins, this is the error:
error: {u'message': u'TX rejected', u'code': -22}

Its better than the fees it costs at cavirtex to cash out and pay your bills. Just sayin
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:18:34
already solved, but thanks anyways.
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:41:55
I will give that a try and report back

Sorry to promote my own note but; put it online, on my dedicated server. Fee collection is only for operation costs but I really don't have a need for them so it'll be donated to miners on the node when it's significant. 
Punchy ui:
Node stats:
Only have my personal miners on it. Enjoy. Again, sorry for the plug.

it does give me the same public address, but it still wont let me send the coins.
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:34:40
Well shit.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:15:58
This is great and all but upon trying to verify with my miiCard...
Bylls currently only accepts miiCards from a set of test users - this is typically the case during development but could signify a problem with their application.

If you live in Calgary and need to trade your coins. Http://bitcoinbrains.com/
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:20:31
As a Calgarian I would love to test this out
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:02:14
i will definitely be giving that a go when i get paid on thursday, i have a bitcoin loan i used to close debt into one small payment, so it will make getting funds a hell of a tonne faster. and i am really excited for the bitcoin bank card. that will be a MAJOR improvement that I can use to my friends to go hey, i just bought dinner with bitcoin, you know those miners at my house that make me money that you dont understand. so ha. lol
@_date: 2013-07-05 05:01:05

I will install this on my dedicated server for testing. Love the idea
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:49:33
sounds good, if anything from what i know with the canadian government, running a business myself. is that you can charge each provinces GST/PST/HST rates for each prov if you want and still be in the legal green.
@_date: 2013-10-09 07:29:38
I utilize block erupters to introduce my friends into bitcoin... I myself have 20gh/s of power and I am personally increasing it to 500 by the end of the year. 
As for my friends I like to give these as gifts when I'm explaining bitcoin to them and i give them a guide to get started. It's really awesome seeing them message me going hey I got bitcoin mining going! 
Would not mind another to give away! Even then, pick someone who could use it the best :)
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:35:29
How come we have to pay HST, what if we are in alberta, we only pay 5% GST.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:57:39
I utilize ING for cavirtex. No issues and no fees.
