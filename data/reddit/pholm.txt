I don't know why you added the word "excessive". The point remains that miners will not intentionally damage the bitcoin ecosystem. Their incentive structure is not in question and is working great. The idea that miners will do something for short term gain at the cost of long term stability is just naive. Miners have way more invested in bitcoin than 99% of this subreddit and more than most devs also. They are the only participant who is actually required to make a significant capital investment.

It doesn't really allow you to have a say.  The network is ultimately controlled by the miners, who will implement whichever protocol they want.  Running a bunch of nodes on a separate protocol without mining hardware to support it is pointless - so your concept of having some say is reliant on convincing some percentage of miners to agree with you and doesn't change the fact that the miners you convince are in control.
If that is insufficient for them to be profitable then they should run the full nodes to ensure their own profitability.  You simply can't have a system where people are trying to sustain the network by posting in r/bitcoin begging for help.  That is not a solution to any problem.

If you aren't making on-chain transactions to pay your rent and buy food, you aren't really "living on bitcoin", you are just storing all of your savings in bitcoin and your day to day expenses are still subject to fluctuation in the price of BTC vs local currency.  
Finding a landlord to take BTC as rent is pretty easy, finding one who will set a fixed amount of BTC and not increase rent based on the exchange rate might be hard.  I think it might be possible in most countries if you can find local businesses to trade BTC for food.  I don't know how you can pay for a phone bill or internet with bitcoins though.

Yes, and you can use that to manipulate bitcoins in such a way that their value increases and then decreases by 100% over a period of a few weeks.  You cannot do that to manipulate USD, and to a large extent you cannot even do that to securities on the NYSE, because they are regulated by the SEC.

Transaction processing is already concentrated in the hands of people who are able to run large datacenter style mining rigs.  The idea that people are going to run transaction processors on rPIs over bluetooth is just a fantasy, it is far beyond that point now and will never go back.

This is such a common and weak argument.  The protocol details are not going to centralize bitcoin mining anymore than it already is.

Yes, that is my argument.  "We need more, smaller miners" is not going to happen.  This second paragraph of yours is a hopeless goal that stopped being realistic several years ago.  
Bitcoin is much more decentralized than Paypal and fiat currency.  It is just not as decentralized as p2p file sharing or the internet itself.  There is no way to fix that, because operating a transaction processing server requires professional knowledge.  Your idea of "smaller miners" is infeasible due to the fact that small miners lose the economy of scale that allows mining to be cost efficient.  That will not ever change, it will become harder and harder to participate without a data center and MW scale deployment.

No, I assume nothing.  I OBSERVE that given complete anarchy, some people will act violently and anti-socially to the detriment of the majority.  It does not matter whether it is rational or not, because for a rational functioning society based on mutual benefit to work, there need to be rules.  For rules to be enforced, there must be some sort of government.
My entire point is that the libertarian ideal of freedom by anarchy has been shown not to work time and again, much like the Marxist ideal of "to each what he needs, from each what he can give" (or whatever).  
The places people want to live all have governments somewhere in between, which recognize that compromises to ideals must be made in practice.  Violence is only one problem that arises without rules.  How about environmental protection?  
Calling the government "violent thugs" is a gross oversimplification and that is again my point - if you reduce the question to "should we have government which functions like violent thugs or no government which is in practice anarchy ruled by violent thugs?" then you miss the spot in the spectrum between the two which is empirically what works the best.
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:09:31
Well, I understand the analogy you are making between government and violent thugs, but I think it's misguided. I mean honestly, in the U.S., you have an expectation that the government is not going to come and take all of your things, rape your wife, and then murder you.  I think that paying a 30% marginal tax rate is a fair trade for that.  
Is there a better compromise, such as in Switzerland, or whatever?  Maybe so, but I still think that asserting that we would be better off taking our chances with the thugs is a risk that in practice nobody is willing to take.  
The slippery slope is not a problem with my argument.  You are saying that if less government seems to lead to more prosperity, then no government must also lead to more prosperity.  However, I think there is a peak in that trend, after which the lack of social structure prevents prosperity rather than encouraging it.  Maybe the peak occurs at the point where we have enough structure to maintain a strong police force and military, and no more.  That is what most libertarians I meet seem to want.
If what we're arguing about is the position of that peak in the X axis of government control, then I think we more or less agree.  However, I thought we were debating about the existence of that peak, and it seems clear to me that the peak does exist and we should stay on the "more government" side of it if in doubt.
Anyway, I'll be interested to read your reply if any, but I have to leave this conversation now as it is time consuming to think about your answers and respond to them.  Thanks for the engagement and interesting conversation.

@_date: 2015-04-04 12:29:26
You are just backpedaling on your original assertion, which is that 'no government' leads to a better society than 'any government.'  It has nothing to do with limited government, and nothing to do with Switzerland because according to you, Switzerland is a band of thugs no better than local militias in a place like Somalia. 
I'm sorry that you are upset by having your dream society compared to Somalia, but there are not very many examples of places with absolutely no government, and that is what you claim to want.  You want a society where "no special groups of people have the right to initiate force against others" and what I am trying to point out is that this is a fantasy which has never existed and never will exist.  Simply removing the government will not result in this paradise (which I agree sounds great).  It will simply result in anarchy where the strong people with guns become the special group of people who have the "right" (meaning: ability) to initiate force against others.
I'm engaged with you because I honestly don't understand how you and other extremist libertarian types think this idea is possible, but I'm curious to hear the answer.  Can you point to ANY example of a place that fits your description?  Switzerland is a government that is allowed to murder, print money, and kidnap it's citizens, so it is obviously not a good representative of the idealistic libertarian state.

Well, if you have some sort of organization that makes rules that everyone has to follow, that is a government.  I don't see how you enforce those rules with an armed police force and the people that the police force answers to are the government.  I mean, you are the person asserting that we don't need a government, so what sort of society are you envisioning if you don't want to call it anarchy? 
And when you ask "Are some people not doing that right now, even without anarchy?"  I would refer you back to my original point which is that if what you are suggesting is that we would be better off in a place like 2011 Somalia which is "without rulers" and hence engulfed in civil war and widespread violence than we are in a western democracy, I would say "no."

I would like to know how you would transfer money on a secure distributed blockchain without using some form of  virtual currency.  If you replace bitcoins with a new currency, then how is that any different?

Well, the desire for consistency is exactly why the anarchist-libertarian society appeals to people like you, and at one point, me.  Unfortunately, in the real world, compromises have to be made, and a logically consistent social structure is not always possible to reconcile with human behavior.  
That is my point - it doesn't matter what you are against, or what you think the best society will be.  It has been proven many times that without the rule of law, force and violence prevails over reason or fair trade.  So when you use language that implies we would be better off without any government, it is a society ruled by strong violent thugs that you are implicitly endorsing.
