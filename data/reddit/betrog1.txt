I don’t see it dipping below 12, all the hype has lead to countless thousands waiting for “the dip” which means the dip will be very small as people will panic buy at the slightest dip

coinbase and most other sites had a limit of £500 per week, since im renting I dont have a utility bill to show as proof of residence, so I was limited in what I could use, i went through localbitcoins eventually, but heard stories of scams on it, hence the nervousness

I dont plan on playing the middle man in short term trades, I'm treating it like a fixed ISA, hodling it and hodling it!

Invested? Nothing. How much have we converted to bitcoin currency is the real question. If you are looking at it like stocks and shares you are living in the past.

Yeah, was just too nervous about being scammed, but I’m intending to hold for a long time (at least a year or two)

I’m new to bitcoin, I was under the impression Xapo and a few others were the only way to transfer bitcoin into “real” money? I’ve got a bitcoin wallet in xapo, is there a way to create a wallet without xapo? And if so how could I access it from my phone as you say I can? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
