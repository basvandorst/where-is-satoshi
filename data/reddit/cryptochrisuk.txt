Just because one piece of shit is better than another doesn’t make it a solution. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:08:34
It’s happened already with most altcoins
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:54:01
Insured anyway 
@_date: 2018-10-04 10:24:48
Looks fake 
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:51:15
Hopefully it gets to 250-300 then we can buy even more
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:31:22
Not many care about the tech and especially not the community. 99% buy bitcoin with the intention of making money after it has increased in value. It’s stupid really.. as people will always need to lose in order for some to win.

You are deluded mate. Same get rich quick story I’ve heard a thousand times. I’ve been trading crypto for years and have nothing against it. But even now the values are still way way too *high* to buy because of deluded people like yourself hodling. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:56:51
Keep dreaming 
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:34:32
Yea it’s built in to the price.. whether you pay card, cash or shitcoin moron
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:26:08
Oo look at me I can make an excel spreadsheet
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:23:42
Sell now before it goes to 0
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:17:26
Clown 
@_date: 2019-10-17 06:13:22
Philosophical reasons lol.. more like every other get rich quick sucker
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:44:56
Bore off it’s early. My 14 year old sister knows about it and even briefly covered what it was at school last year. 
It would literally be a challenge to find someone who hasn’t heard of it now .. it’s far from early. 
What it remains is a good concept that is fundamentally flawed for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:42:05
Ooo look at me I have a ledger.. pathetic
@_date: 2019-06-08 19:02:36
Yea great until your house burns down
@_date: 2019-02-07 09:10:08
There will always be some other idiot though. Need a better solution for a global currency. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:25:09
For $100 I’m sure coinbase is fine 
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:41:49
Shut up
@_date: 2019-04-15 00:35:28
Very risky not to buy bitcoin now ��.. sorry I can’t read anymore after this
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:38:06
He looks like the next high school shooter
@_date: 2019-04-15 00:37:05
100k, 250k etc.. this thread kills me.
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:39:04
People that buy in order to try and sell for gains are not using it for its intended purpose
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:38:57
So true, typical crypto heads making a use case out of nothing 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:02:04
Because it’s over valued for what it is
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:09:40
If you care about the price you are buying it for the wrong reason. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:10:49
It’s overvalued that’s why it’s dropped. There is no guarantee it goes anywhere close to 6k again, it’s pure speculation and as of now it looks far more likely to go to 1k than 6k. But you sound like the definition of people that need to lose money so others can benefit so please take the loan.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:34:03
These coins have no use case or intrinsic value. So technically they are just worth what any mug wants to pay for them... 
Wait a minute ...
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:36:28
Yes, however they are sold via international auction to the highest bidder 
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:30:30
Your parents are right tbf lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:07:03
Haha you must be trolling .. no one can be this stupid 
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:55:14
Ponzi coins
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:32:37
But yet valued in USD
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:51:19
Year 2030: 
Me: hey, you remember cryptocurrency? 
My mate: Haha..  yea!
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:07:12
‘Fast clap’
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:05:50
No. Stop it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:06:33
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:05:12
I raised my eyebrows and breathed out
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:59:10
Try explaining what a hardware wallet is to my mother. It’s just never happening in its current form.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:37:02
Can only assume after this pic they sold no lemonade as no one in your street uses bitcoin and this is purely a photo taken 20 mins before they packed up
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:18:05
No lol because large institutions inflate the market on a bull run before selling a larger quantity leaving bags
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:40:03
You might not have losted anything yet but you will soon be left holdings the bags
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:13:27
All this video proves is bitcoin is way too complex for mass adoption in its current form
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:23:03
You do know that if Binance have any suspicion at all that these funds may have in some way been sourced through any type of criminal activity the exchange is legally bound to raise a Suspicious Activity Report to authorities and in doing so they are again legally bound to hold those funds until all legal investigations have ended. 
They are also legally unable to tell you why or how long as that would be ‘tipping off’ and that is again illegal. 
It’s likely an incredibly complicated task for whichever money laundering agency is involved to track the source of these funds so will likely take a long time before you are able to withdraw ... even if you are legit.
Btw I can’t see that you have explained ... where did you source the fiat money to purchase this huge amount of bitcoin and what period did it originate ?
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:18:03
ʕ ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°ʔ
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:41:07
Lol yea accumulate right before the tether scandal bankrupts the market
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:41:52
Yet you’ve only had a profile 2 years
P.s. how’s piggycoin worked out for ya
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:39:35
