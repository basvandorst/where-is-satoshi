very clever, sir

Horrible idea.  Treat this as you would any other highly speculative investment.  Only invest what you're prepared to lose, because there's a very real possibility that this whole thing could blow up in our faces.

I agree.  We need to think of ways to make it more usable and acceptable at the merchant level.  However, BTC settlements just take way too long for it to be truly useful yet.  Hopefully scaling fixes that.

1.  How does one execute this? 
2. All I have is Coinbase....is that not a wallet as well? 
3. If Coinbase isn't a wallet, what are the risks of me just keeping my BTC at the exchange? 
4.  What are the best wallets that support Segwit? 
Thanks! (Im still learning)

Amen, brother.  Have to find that fine line between living for the moment and thinking/planning for the future.

Will do

So the private keys change every time BTC is sent to a new address? That would make sense if its true and would make everything more secure.

Makes sense.  Thanks for sharing!

Ok cool.  So I assume the key is controlled on the hardware itself, not the accompanying software? If so, couldn't the client software (on the pc) be compromised just like a traditional software wallet?

Thanks a lot.  I'll get on this in the morning.
