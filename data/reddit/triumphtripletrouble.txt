Consider it a regular wallet (a really good one) that runs as an app in the Google Chrome browser. To activate it, you need to plug in your HW.1 USB stick into the computer and enter a pin. In case it gets lost or broken, you would keep a 24 word seed written down, kept in a safe, or preferably, off site. It's the safest way to store Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:19:08
I use Mycelium or Ledger wallets and both are pretty good at predicting fees and both offer different options. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:51:20
I looked all through the app and Googled it as well. There are other people not using BW because of it. 
But I wanted to ask about bits vs mBTC vs BTC rather than have to much emphasis on Bread Wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:29:11
I just got a Ledger Nano S. I have an extra Ledger HW.1 if you want it for cheap.

Go to the bank and open a safe deposit box. Keep your seed in there. Provide instructions via Google Inactive Account Manager to email your family 3 months (or however long) after you last access your Google account. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:04:52
Thanks. Would have never known that was there. I've already installed and set up Mycelium though, and I love it. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:16:46
Good idea. I know that with the seed, there is almost a guaranteed method of recovering manually. I just want to future proof the process in case I die or something and my family has to use the seed. I thought that Mycelium was kind of... dead in terms of development. You're probably right with the idea that Mycelium just isnt in support.

Any idea if the BIP 44 derivation path is different for Segwit style wallets? Something has to be different to be able to generate all Segwit addresses. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:47:42
Ledger responded and said that the funds are safe, and would be restored by any wallet with BIP 49 functionality. BIP 49 is to SW as BIP 44 is to legacy addresses. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:35:54
Thank you! I read BIP 49 and now I understand. I will share this with anyone else who has the same questions. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:51:29
You still have to open and close the channel. I don't see how lightning would help. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:59:15
Would'nt this cause issues with BIP32/39 wallet restoration, though? I made a thread [here]( not too long ago. Mycelium couldnt find/generate my Ledger Segwit master pubkey wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:47:16
All wallets are different bud. Mycelium sucks. Get a wallet that you can make custom fees with. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:46:45
We will need 2MB eventually, so why not now? Let's not let BCH gain steam.

If you spend $20 on bitcoin all the time and keep withdrawing, your wallet will have tons of UXTOs and next time you go to spend a large amount, there will be an insane amount of inputs and an insane fee. So better off with large purchases or large withdrawals 
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:30:23
The channel still needs to close for them to "cash out" 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:05:54
Thanks a ton! This explanation really helped. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:37:37
Some wallets are better suited for power users and some are better suited for beginners. I would suggest finding a different wallet better suited for beginners. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:33:17
Ahh, I was drunk, sitting in the hurricane last night and didnt look to see who I was replying to. You have a good point about the UI and I had mistakenly read it as "the UI is causing me to not know which fee to choose" kind of issue. I appreciate all that you do! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:53:06
There's a fee to open and close a channel. Explain to me how its near zero fee. Are you assuming that you will make many many transactions off chain before closing the channel? I don't see how lightning will help the average user much. How many people transact with the same party often? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:43:26
Absolutely not like how Tor works. You have no idea how Lightning works. Each party in control needs to have the private key in order to sign an n-lock TX. You are insulting me yet you have no idea what the hell you are talking about.

@_date: 2017-10-16 02:26:25
Ok so, instead of opening channels between one user and another, you open them with nodes or a central party? And in the next breath you speak about privacy?

@_date: 2017-05-09 04:35:46
With the Trezor you back up a mnemonic which is a representation of your private key. The private key is securely kept on the device. You would send the BTC from the exchange to the public key you get from your wallet.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:44:41
Thank you! A mere upvote would have probably sufficed, but you put this very well.

WTF is up with the rbtc idiots on here. Go back home to your senseless subreddit.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:35:35
I'm interested in one thing: keeping Bitcoin in the  crypto spot. That is through Segwit. Then we can add hardcoded 2mb blocks if we need a larger increase over the increase that Segwit provides. If you want to support Jihan's agenda over supporting Segwit then you are delusional.  Edit: And btw don't just assume you've been here longer; I've been here since 2012.
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:51:04
Gotcha; that makes sense! I haven't heard anything about the coinjoin project in a while though. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:13:34
I'm mostly vested in BTC, but the Monero project is extremely advanced, and the crypto offers true anonymity. It's the only alt I truly believe in.  The community is amazing also.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:22:53
Hard fork vs soft fork. And Segwit gives a capacity of near 2mb anyways. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:09:47
How is it worse than a contentious hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:04:27
All of rbtc is lies and idiots. After all that happened so far, I cant believe they are still going.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:48:16
Yes the private key is nothing but a very large number. Same with the public keys. The private key can be be represented from a mixture of 24 words (or 12 or 18). The public keys are derived form the private key in a predictable fashion in the case of HD wallets (hierarchical deterministic).  If you have the private key you can generate public keys, but you cannot do this in reverse without harnessing all of the the power of a galaxy. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:01:42
The capital "C" in Bitcoin makes me cringe. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:17:53
Can someone explain how Segwit increases fungibility? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:13:16
You have one seed, and one HD wallet (in my case, Ledger). Create multiple accounts within that wallet. This protect you from the "accidental overspend" that others are talking about, since you can only spend what is in that account, in one transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:51:47
The best answer is this: convert the BTC to Monero. This way it is effectively "tumbled" and if anyone asks if you own Bitcoin you can say "no" without lying. Monero is untraceable. Once you receive it through a site like Shapeshift, send it to a second address like a day later with a high mixin. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:38:13
It won't go much above 100 million coins, but at the same time, it's being mined at like 14x the rate of BTC at the moment. Why dont you like Monero?
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:41:12
If all the Core has power signaled BIP 148 then there would be no problem. Maybe everyone is just waiting 
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:13:00
I agree with you that UASF will fail. No one wants it besides Luke and a bunch of noob redditors. I want Segwit2x. It's the only way forward that has a any chance. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:07:44
How long will it take for the difficulty to change on the BIP148 chain?
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:59:49
Exactly. Usually what I do is pick somewhere in the middle of the most expensive grouping that lists "Inf" as the longest expected wait time. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:57:17
If you're correct then I'm sure you will be back to say "I told you so". If you're wrong, I won't be hearing from you. I'm not trying to say you're wrong - just tires of the hodl stuff in every si glue thread. I hope you are right, because I have a ton of money in BTC 
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:59:09
That's a terrible analogy and that's not how bitcoin works fundamentally, whether you and I like it or not. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:41:34

Not that I know of. Usually exchanges spend robust fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:28:38
Mycelium does the same thing. Except the lowest fee tier is like 230 sat/b
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:14:21

Segwit2x has a much better chance for Segwit
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:19:39
Screw that. Signal for Segwit + 2mb. Bip 148 is a disaster
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:06:12
It will go through the peer review process though 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:13:08
The wallet may tell you. Don't worry about the bytes, just look at the satoshis per byte. And the ultimate transaction cost. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:12:46

@_date: 2017-06-09 19:16:02
Duplicate. I'll put the same seed on it. I keep my seed in a safe deposit box so I'm going to move my funds to the account with the 25th word encrypted seed. Then you have a second PIN with a hidden account. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:01:42
Pretty neat! Rock on! I made two transactions at the same time with the same fee, for the purpose of consolidating my UXTOs. One transaction has 4 inputs and the other had 13. The one with 13 was included in the next block while the one with few inputs had to wait 12-24 hours. Fees were 120 sat/byte for each one, about a week ago. This would explain it. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:12:43
Keep it somewhere else. Like on Google inactive account manager and have it set up to email a few people if you don't log into your account for a few months. Also include instructions on how to find the 24 word seed. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:06:45
The best option is to use one HD wallet/seed and multiple BIP44 accounts.

There is 80+% support for Segwit 2x. There is a lot less support for BIP148

Me too. It's not very exciting at the moment. More "safe" IMO.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:04:34

@_date: 2017-06-17 04:56:27
I bought mostly in 2013 at an average price of $250. Never sold, even through the Mt Gox shit, Silk Road shutdown, etc. In the past year, converted bitcoin to ethereum and monero. Ethereum was $200 and now is $350. Monero was $19 and now is $49. Sold $15k worth of bitcoin yesterday (unfortunately near the bottom - $2200) and made a net profit of over $11k. Now I'm free and clear, plus I still have a decent amount of BTC, XMR, and ETH. 
I want bitcoin to succeed, but I'm a lot more stress free at this point. Maybe around flag day I will "trade" a little and hopefully make some more money. 
In holding this shit LONG term now. Im not even close to being in the 21 club anymore, but it shouldnt matter that much in 10 years if bitcoin does hit mainstream. 
But there is still inner angst. Why didn't I sell at $3k when the Bitmain news came? In hindsight, it was extremely stupid. I dont think I'm the only one in this boat. Why the angst? Greed? Has crypto changed a lot of us for the worst?

@_date: 2017-06-25 21:51:42
I'm having a hard time following your writing, but I think you are confusing CPFP and RBF. RBF wouldn't be a problem with Bitpay because the RBF tx can only be replaced with a higher fee, not lower.

I just made a TX with Mycelium for Android and set the fee to "low prio" which is supposed to have the TX confirmed in about 6 hours and is the lowest you can set the fee out of the 4 options. My TX was confirmed in the next block. The fee was a whopping 237 sat/byte. Rediculus! Mycelium is way better than Bread wallet, but please include the option to pay custom fees! I would have chosen 130 sat/byte.

90% of my crypto assets are in Bitcoin and 10% in Ethereum. I first bought at $12, then sold at $13 because I was pissed off after reading about the fork and centralization in general. Then I bought again at $200 and I'm now way up. ETH gives me a bad feeling in my stomach, and I hate the community. All they do is circlejerk and bash Bitcoin over there. Thinking about converting all my ETH back to BTC or XMR.

Bitcoins other threats weren't directly related to bitcoin. Mt gox had nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol. Silk Road had nothing to do with the protocol. China withdrawal freeze had nothing to do with the protocol. This potential fork threatens bitcoin itself.

They probably all left rBTC and went to rEthtrader to jerk each other off and talk shit about Bitcoin!

I recommend the site but I do not recommend using the recommended site's recommendation. Just look at their charts and choose a fee. Forget what they recommend.

I also support it 100%. I prefer it over BIP148 which will be a disaster.

It would be hard to define what "cold storage" is. And no way to tell anyways

But the core devs will always be against block size increases, regardless.

Did you buy back in? At what price?

This doesnt answer my question. See "Edit 2" in the OP.

Are you meaning more for future transactions or for past transactions as well?

I just consolidated over a dozen UTXO's with a "small" custom fee of 130sat/byte. It took less than a day to confirm. If I ever want to sell privately I can convert BTC to XMR and back.

I guess they could implement it where you "request" a RBF (not sign it yourself since you don't control the keys), but like I said, the exchanges use robust fees. Whenever I have withdrawn from an exchange the fees were high enough to get included in the next block. I withdrew from Gemini yesterday and the fee was just over 420 sat/byte. They wouldn't stay in business if their clients funds took 2 days to confirm.

Sorry, maybe you're right. I remember reading a popular thread on this sub from a bitcoin tax specialist but now I can't find it.
