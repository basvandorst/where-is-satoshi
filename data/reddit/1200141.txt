The market can't both factor in and not factor the etf approved. If the market expects the etf to be approved, than the current price should reflect that. That means no moon if that is the case.

Exactly my point. Both sides are playing this war.

Bitcoin maximalism is a great meme invented by vitalik to unify his people against a common enemy. Vitalik is an ethereum maximalist, and you are a Erik Voorhees maximalist. Another way to call it self interest. To say that any other community in crypto are not 'maximalists' is just to deny reality.

Lol, no one in the eth community ever accused eth classic for being bitcoiners... never..

Nice in theory unfortunately reality shows the financial incentives are competing. Go to ethtrader and see everyone celebrate bitcoins impending death (in their mind). Not just Reddit community either... many prominent etherum personas celebrating bitcoin missteps as well

What an amazing troll

You are building a business to service your self, which is fine. Why do you expect the community to support you servicing competitors? Was Microsoft vs Sun/Netscape/whatever a religion or simple business competition?

he's fully vested as he just finished his 4th year at the company. It's Brian's company and Fred really has no reason to financial reason to stay.

not dead just massively over funded. they probably still have most of the money

I wonder what that means for 21. At the moment 21 is important because they have Balaji and because they raised a bunch of money. If he leaves it's just a startup that raised a bunch of money.

Best blockchain startup of 2016: slockit was supposed to be some version of airbnb.

board of directors includes, besides the founders, Reid Hoffman (investor in Blockstream and Xapo) and Jeff Jordan (partner at Andressen Horowitz, investors in 21 and Coinbase) so I don't think you can say the board is anti bitcoin.
Although this is not a board level decision in any case.

Based on what evidence?

Let's do it! Best solution to the current problem, core get segwit and not sacrifice too much, big blockers get their hard fork..
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:12:14
If bitcoin core devs agree to what ltc devs agreed to there would also be an agreement.
Block size increase when blocks half full = hf now even with segwit deployed (for bitcoin)

So we should decrease it to 1kb to improve all of those?
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:23:28
If an overwhelming majority supports segwit, why hasn't it activated yet? Guess what, because it's not.

Guy from reddit knows the truth about 9/11, CIA still in the dark. Sad and doesn't further a solution.
