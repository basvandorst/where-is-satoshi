Kraken user here

Unfortunately Mt.Gox issues are still here.
News like this are with huge impact to the market!
I also wish to have bullish market, but reality is different. Idk what to say, just be careful with your investments.

Cheer up guys we are somewhere at the point of depression 
Brace yourself!

I support you analysis even that TA means nothing for crypto most of the time:) Actually we have morning star doji in Thursday, but unfortunately it was not confirmed by green candle in Friday. Now we are waiting for 3 stars and pray that market will back to normal soon.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:56:43
This is it bro, no more dips:)
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:35:48
There is too many unsuccessful attempts on 1h and 2h chart, thats why I belive that this will not end good.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:44:13
Just bought some, price looks reasonable. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:28:15
Nothing is burnt it is just temporary loss. If you follow the rule'' invenst only what you can afford to lose" you don't have nothing to worry. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:49:30
If you trade based on some reddit chat, you must not trade crypto at all;)
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:05:34
Well I was wrong:)
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:15:06
I will wait for tomorrow, because when I look 1h chart I have a filing that this is not just correction, unfortunately. 
This is not investment advice just my opinion!
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:14:54
Bullshit, the price is market driven only. If there is lot of ppl ready to pay 50000 USD for BTC than price is 50000 same for price below 5000. And that's it, forget about miners, technology, banks and other stuff.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:53:17
I belive that it is not so smart to sell on loss and rebouth again:)
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:37:58
This ain't gona happen, but if happen BTC price will be last thing that you should care about.
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:07:08
That's why I think that we are in depression not in denial, BTC hodl's are very tough :) I don't have BTC but will hodl my alts. MOON OR NOTHING :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:39:06
On 1h chart everything goes from one bull trap to another  from 2days. It is disgusting:(
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:11:29
I will say that we need one more day to say what will happen. If it break 8500 EUR(sorry about that:)) in next 12 h and if tomorrow is green candle we will have bullish week. On 1h chart you will see yesterday oversold based on RSI 28 and Stoch below 20. On 1 day chart they are far away from overbought.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:58:10
Prepare for take off 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:40:07
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:14:09
On what chart do you see bull trap, please show me.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:47:49
Immediately to Kraken account, if you transfer them to hard wallet up to 10 minutes. If you transfer from hard wallet to Kraken more than 1h.
I use Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:38:11
And this is based on what?
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:44:15
It is very bearish, but I used to it, profit is less but still you can gain some. Just more trading time needed. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:53:41
Selling BTC that are bought on 3500 is not so smart desicion:P
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:33:27
In Kraken doesn't look that bad:)
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:11:46

If you want to be unprepared sceptic don't listen me:)
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:17:34
Around 2 working days for deposit and withdrawal for EU.
What do you mean how fast arr transactions?
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:14:40
I use Nano and it is good and cheaper.

Looks like only bears left in USA:)
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:12:00
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:43:35
True but this dip/correction/ goes for around 30%. 1h chart looks so bearish.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:01:21
I gave up and sell everything before few minutes, market is disgusting place this days.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:10:32
I'm not an expert, but my opinion is that we must wait for couple of hours, it  looks more like false break on 4h  to me and RSI is slightly in overbought area.

@_date: 2018-12-07 12:18:29
You know that this will not last long, BTC will find its bottom soon and everything will be back to normal. Do you think that it is normal to be up while whole market is down?
