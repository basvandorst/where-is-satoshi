it consumes too much electricity and confirmation time is too slow even with priority fee.
I want miners that can run on raspberry pi and 1 minute or less confirmation time
There are other better coins that consumes much less electricity such as NEM.io
that does not require miners to do proof of work and instant confirmation such as Dash

Bitfinex is forcing 36% loss on its traders. 
How about its traders sue Bitfinex and forcing Bitfinex to liquidate their assets to cover their loss?

you tried sending a real segwit to segwit txt? and compared it to non-segwit to non-segwit? using exactly same fee?

Lightning network and instant confirmation within 30 seconds would pump the price exponentially. 
Yuan devalues. Chinese flock to bitcoins as alternative would also help.

True. But there is a limit on how much they can spam the network before it gets economically unprofitable to do so. Cost vs return.

waste of electricity...there is no apps or user bases..

It's not going to cause a massive panic dump or pump. It has already occurred. Look at the big price movement in the past 3 days.

CNY Volumes are still huge compared to USD. at least 40 times bigger.

Smart contract should be treated like a database. Secure,  migratible,  and zero down time.  It's hard to do all three.  That's why we have enterprise software applications costing millions of dollars and millions of lines of codes.. I don't think it's that easy to do smart contract that can do all three without millions lines of codes like traditional databases.

are you sure? China exchanges stopping margin trading and futures?
Can anyone verify this?
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:09:10
yes. It's called Bitcoin CASH. 
No one will start to refer to bitcoin as microbitcoin..sounds like an idiot when we all start talking bitcoin as microbitcoin.

Trading a decentralized currency on a centralized exchange with strong KYC? Does it sound like a recipe for disaster? Does it miss the purpose of holding a decentralized currency?
If you want to look at a good example of a decentralized bitcoin exchange, see bitsquare.
Or btc-e for no KYC.

so trezor is not safe and can be hacked!!!! OMG...I thought hardware wallet is bulletproof...NOT

Multi-signature paper wallet. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:35:27
The hell with mnemonic. I encrypt my digital paper wallet's public and private keys with PGP. 
Done. 
I email it to my self and email to anybody I trust.  
Now only need to memorize an easy PGP pass phrase to decrypt. 
And paper wallet is completely safe.  NO NEED TO GO THROUGH THIRD PARTY LIKE WITH MNEMONIC

electrum is the best
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:14:07
that wallet is bad bad bad... blockchain.info has gone offline many times in the past.

So China has majority of the mining powers due to cheap labors, electricity, and hardware cost.
1. Have bitcoin become centralized now that China can decide what mining protocols to adopt( core vs classic or xt )?
2. Will it help if the mining hardware were to be ASIC resistant? Litecoin is theoretically ASIC resistant, yet China have majority mining powers of Litecoin.
