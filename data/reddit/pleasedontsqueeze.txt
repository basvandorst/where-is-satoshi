The headlines will be how bitcoin dropped from $300,000 to $250,000 and people will be asking if this is the end of bitcoin. Lol

She’s probably begging him for money and getting upset when he declines.

That’s the Facebook mentality for bitcoin. Almost every bitcoin news article posted on FB is filled with comments from people that are convinced that it’s either a pyramid scheme or something that is only used to buy drugs and hire a hit man.

I wonder how many people all over the world are typing in that seed right this minute.

You live a sad life.

"You can't accuse one side without acknowledging the guilt of other and still be taken seriously."
Democrats and MSM do just this everyday, all day and I'll bet you have no issues with that.

A lot of people have been through this. I bought at $800 3 years ago and the very next day was the MTGOX crash. It took 3 years to finally come back up to what I paid for them.  You better believe when they were $300 I was kicking myself thinking about how many more I could have bought at that price. You aren't alone. Just hang in there.

That probably sucked at the time, but you came out great if you got in at $120. Wish I would have got in that early.

I bought bitcoin at $800 in Feb of 2014. The very next day was the Mt Gox crash. It's been a long 3 years.

Yeah, I convinced myself that I would rather lose it than to risk selling at a loss and then see it take off afterwards. I would love to see it hit $1000,000!

You can recover your phrase in settings. Did you set up a 4 digit passcode? That's all it asks for to recover it.
