I know what a future is. 
I keep seeing people say “futures are closing”. It’s not correct terminology. 
Do you mean the contracts are expiring ? Or do you mean one of the exchanges has decided to stop and close futures trading?

Crypto is a token of credit not a token of debt like the US dollar. 
Hyperinflation doesn’t care about guns. 
You watch the debt ceiling crush the US. It’s imminent. It started last week with US bonds going to shit and China ceasing the purchase of them. 
Yes, I believe sovereign-less money has more value than any ex gold standard, sovereign issuance. 
Just my view tho. You might be right. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:09:50
When you say closing, do you mean they expire? Or that the markets are being ceased. If the latter do you have a src?

Fungibility cannot be solved as a non protocol layer solution. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:42:14


It’s a Boolean trait not a spectrum. 
And no, lightning will not “improve fungibility”. The net Tx is still written to mainchain. 
How do you think sch sigs will improve privacy?
I say the above as a bitcoin advocate. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:38:23
Exactly. Similarly with privacy. Monero and it’s fungibility property have value. Bitcoin cannot compete with Monero in that respect. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:46:33
I say this as someone with ZERO bitcoin.


What are you talking about? Do you know the mcap of G10 ccys? It's an order of magnitude greater than xxx Billion.
Crypto is soverignless, borderless, permissionless internet money. That is immense power. Away from ECB interest rates and quantitative easing. Away from the toxic, growing, US Debt ceiling. 


I think you're farcical in your expectation that BTC won't breach this value.
I have no bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-19 09:27:13
I think you need to learn more. Lightning doesn’t create fungibility, net txs are written back to mainchain. Additionally privacy issues are still unaddressed. If you think lightning will bring anonymity to BTC you either didn’t do a deep dive or you’re being led by someone else’s dogshit posts. 
A microcosm of the entire problem in the space.

Huge quality post thank you...
On mobile so I will try my best:
1. Transaction Propagation


Kovri - a custom C++ implementation of I2P. It's a delight. Check it here: 
2. Network analysis.


Monero level privacy at mobile level is tough. Personally I run a local Monero node in my home and connect to it using a light wallet (Xwallet/Cakewallet, which are iOS wallets). They transmit the ViewKey portion of the Monero keyset to my node, which doesn't compromise my privacy. In the future others can use the core mobile wallet but again, without running a full node there are privacy concerns. Complete privacy requires some effort.
3. Scalability


Hard disk size and bandwidth are growing faster than Monero. RuffCT, Bulletproofs etc will ensure that Monero doesn't grow faster than infrastructure can support it. Long term, trustless Zk-STARKS will have to be looked at. Also MimbleWimble will help. Not a concern. Mainchain privacy will be used where needed. Monero is Swissbank account of crypto.
4. Stealth addresses


Monero uses RingCT, Ring Sigs, Stealth Addresses and eventually Kovri. Monero is best of breed privacy in current terms. Privacy must be trustless, unlike ZEC or others. Only ZKS**T**arks currently may provide more privacy. They are not implemented in production and have enormous computational burden.


Christ. I'm so tired of that FUD paper. Monero link was DISCOVERED AND PUBLISHED FIRST by Monero research labs. It's a deprecated issue. It's been fixed. And it was announced by Moneros dev team.
The whole study is a ZEC hit piece. Look at the people involved.
Regarding Anon set, look at StringCT/RuffCT.
I agree the unlinkability aspect of Monero could be improved, but it doesn't compromise anonymity. In fact it's the least important of the monero tech. Additionally as stated above, that issue is resolved, and even at the time of publish was fixed.
Those people are out and out cunts with no integrity. They make me sick.
ZEC is a dogshit crypto, and they are responsible for Cazes death. They are murderers in my view. 
CoinJoin is nonsense. ZEC has trusted setup and non-auditable supply.
Monero is as good as it gets right now, and will lead the way in the future most likely as it has the best minds in the space in MRL. ZKStarks provide more privacy, but are not ready yet.
Here's my address: 49Sn5H1axWVRBxnpuPtKmNS8c2oS3vJvdELBcVCzHHMC8VRBps2noxHTrW6wwzioHxKzAcfarVhqJH7MkzRvGxsLJBkiJTG

Your presumptions are incorrect. 
* I don’t think privacy is just for criminals it’s a human right. 
* Monero is the most private coin that currently exists. It’s perfectly fungible. Please provide evidence that it’s not “anonymous enough”. 
* Scaling is 84% more efficient with bulletproofs. 
Ringsize is not the only privacy feature in Monero. There are so many mistakes in your writing I don’t know where to begin. 
Are you technical? If you are I’d like to educate you. If you’re not then you are labouring under a misapprehension. 
**You will never have privacy with bitcoin**
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:47:02
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:25:20
Yes it would be lessened asssuming the buyer held too. If you selll me 1million BTC for 5usd each it doesn’t affect price. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:02:12
If BTC is worth 100K ETH, sadly, will probably be worth 10K
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:02:42
How have you dealt with the fungibility issue?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:40:59
You’re a moron. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:38:52
No second layer solution can add privacy to a public blockchain.
All lightning TX will need to be written to mainchain. 
The migration of users from BTC to Monero for privacy has already begun, and is evident in the ever increasing XMR/BTC price.
Bitcoin will stay king, but privacy it will never have.

I worked as a forex trader for a major bank, and now work as an fx options analyst and the forex markets would have closed way before half the value was lost. This is the right course of action. You have to be professional. They clearly should have done this a long time ago. 
 *% drop : * time : * cessation period
* 10 	before 2 pm	one hour halt
* 10 	2 pm – 2:30 pm	half-hour halt
* 10 	after 2:30 pm	market stays open
* 20 	before 1 pm	halt for two hours
* 20 	1 pm – 2 pm	halt for one hour
* 20 	after 2 pm	close for the day
* 30 	any time during day	close for the day

There are several major differences. Bitcoin is a currency with a built in payment system for its currency. Ripple is a payment system for arbitrary currencies with support for cross-currency transactions.
One big difference is that currencies in Ripple are represented as debts (IOUs). This is much the way currencies are represented in the conventional banking system. When you say, "I have $5,000 in my bank account", what you mean is that the bank owes you $5,000. When you write someone a check, you are transferring debt so that their bank owes them more money and thus they consider you to have paid them. Ripple works this same way -- payments occur by a transfer of debt (IOU).
You can generally get a Bitcoin transaction through for free if you're patient. Ripple transactions always have an XRP cost. In practice, this cost should remain very low. Transaction fees are destroyed in Ripple, they aren't paid to anyone.
Ripple payments can incur fees other than transaction fees. It is hoped that competition will keep these costs low. If your payment requires using someone else's liquidity, they can impose a fee for that liquidity. IOU issuers can impose fees on transfers of IOUs.
Ripple transactions should confirm more quickly, typically in under 15 seconds.
While Ripple is designed to operate without a central authority, currently all servers are operated or managed by Opencoin and the server code has not been publicly released yet. So it's not really open source or distributed yet, but it will be. Currently, most XRP (the units used to pay transaction fees) are held by Opencoin. Opencoin plans to begin giving them away shortly.
It is also important to understand that using Ripple as a store of value for fiat currencies imposes a counter-party risk. If you hold dollars in Ripple, someone you have chosen to trust owes you those dollars. If you misplace trust, you can wind up with uncollectable IOUs.
Ripple uses gateways, companies that make it their business to make "settle on demand" agreements with people, to hold IOUs. Ripple is much less useful for payments of fiat currencies if there aren't reliable gateways you can trust to hold your money.
In function, Ripple is more like PayPal or Visa than Bitcoin. But its internal implementation is based on the same technologies Bitcoin uses -- public transactions, no central authorities, cryptographically secured transactions, peer-to-peer transaction propagation, and so on.

Wondering how the leverage will work, will you not be effectively extending credit?

I was trying to achieve a very clean look without labeling or axis getting in the way, to give at a glance a quick perception of market movement, holding a touch on the graph reveals hi and lo of the session. but good idea I'll try and add them in a clean way.
I'll definitely check into that btct site, with regard to tickers, I'm in London so most interested in GBP ticker too - (although the GBP market is not a liquid as USD so not as fun to watch!)
You can flick the graph to show USD, GBP or EUR
Can't customize what's displayed at the moment, but I can look at adding this later down the line :)

Yeah you are right, it would be nice to keep a dataset, at the moment when you kill it the charts are reset.
I'm definitely working on updates already, there is only so much you can do in the background in iOS 6 - in iOS 7 they've added background network access so plenty more features to come hopefully!
Thanks for the feed back - I find the app is best after it's been running for a while and has alot of datapoints.
If you use 3 fingers and tap the graph it will pop up a MtGox trade window, also if you long touch the graph with one finger it will show depth.
Thanks again for feedback :)

Quick one, you can cash out of gox with an unverified account in gbp, up to 1000£ a day right?

Because the market could suddenly drop in BTC.

I sold some earlier at 59 gbp and bought back at 57.5, yielding more BTC, thus my multiplier at current MP is higher.

After a crash they typically open slightly higher than they were at before the close. 
People anticipate a rally given the panic is over. 
These are professional traders though, not amateur speculators. 
I think (opinion) Gox will open at 120 and go from there - the only thing that will then change price is people's buys and sells, sounds obvious but it's true.

So forgive my ignorance, if I want to sell say a MacBook Pro, that I think is worth 800gbp, so For example I put it in for 8btc, someone agrees to pay, I assume I get 8btc -1.5 % and he gets his mbp shipped by me?
Not trolling serious question
1. Why not take te deal private after we agree and find each other?
2. Done throug the site do you act as a kind of PayPal and verify the transaction made in btc? Then I ship?
3. Of course I would, but what if I didn't ship what happens to the guys btc?
4. What happens if the buyer receives the goods but claims he didn't how is seller covered?

Why does anyone trade any currency, to try to make profit, or because the other currency is required instead.
