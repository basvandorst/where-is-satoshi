Quick and dirty translation:
The Hague, March 6, 2014 - "Bitcoin Boulevard", under this term on March 20 The Hague will experience the introduction of the internet currency Bitcoin to a dozen cooperating local bars and restaurants. These companies are located on the World Canal, also known as the Culinary Avenue, in the center of The Hague.
The visitor can pay for food and drinks with the innovative internet currency, Bitcoin. With the launch of the Bitcoin Boulevard initiative, enterpreneurs show that they are ready to service the now growing group of bitcoin payers in the Netherlands.
"With a smartphone, with the right app or an online wallet anyone can pay. But first buy some Bitcoin of course. Those who want to come prepared on the 20th should visit  to read more about Bitcoin, said Peter Klasen, spokesman of Bitcoin Boulevard.
Bart van Doorn of Restaurant M adds: "I ​​like to experiment with new developments and will hold a Happy Hour until half past five for anyone who pays with Bitcoin" .
The organization was set up by the local entrepreneurs in cooperation with Galerie West and some Bitcoin enthusiasts. They want to bring positive attention to Bitcoin, because according to them the occasional "bad apple" in the Bitcoin world unfairly caused bad press for Bitcoin lately. Bitcoin Boulevard is a unique way to make the abstract concept of bitcoin concrete to the average customer, and is a fun way to show the strength of innovation of The Hague enterpreneurs.
Bitcoin Boulevard invites any interested customers, financial professionals and / or fans of The Hague to get a drink on March 20 and preferably pay for it with Bitcoin. At 17:57 pm, the exact start of spring, The Hague night mayor Rene Bomb will festively pay for the 1st consumption with Bitcoin. For more information see

72.52.5.67 is the IP for the domain name mtgox.com, which is **hosted by** Prolexic.
    ~$ whois 72.52.5.67
    NetRange:       72.52.0.0 - 72.52.63.255
    CIDR:           72.52.0.0/18
    NetName:        PROLEXIC
Sorry, perhaps it's not an easy subject to understand unless you are familiar with network engineering.

~~Curious enough the old webserver isn't responding at the moment either: 
Edit: the correct IP now seems to be

Uncertainty (not being able to check up on what's going on at your favorite forum) is an even better catalyst for panic ;)

They have been down for 30 minutes straight now. This means either Prolexic is worth shit, but I find it more likely that they screwed up their maintenance and are blaming it on a ddos.

Every single one of those sites was functioning perfectly fine earlier today, then from one moment to the next they all simultaneously fell. Does that sound like a coincidence?

It's pretty obvious that you cannot handle the current load on your systems. Instead of keeping your trading engine running during these times as if nothing is happening, why not introduce some limits? I'm thinking minimum order size, maximum amount of trades per user per minute, user registration throttling, etcetera. This would give you the breathing room to actually catch up while still running a mostly functional exchange, instead of a system which is permanently lagged and overloaded, and as result extremely volatile and pretty much impossible to use or rely on.

Why is MtGox down right now?

If you google 'mtgox 72.52.5.67', you can see that they have been using this IP (and thus Prolexic) all the way since 2011. The chance that someone has looked up and remembered their actual IP address **and** that they were stupid enough not to change it after switching to Prolexic is pretty small.
Combine that with the fact that preventing a ddos attack on their actual servers is very easy to prevent: the only thing they have to do is block all incoming traffic from IPs other than 72.52.0.0/18.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:52:48
The whole idea behind a setup like this is that nobody (outside mtgox or prolexic) knows the IP addresses of the actual MtGox servers: all traffic to MtGox goes through the Prolexic network, which (after filtering ddos attacks) transparently forwards it to the actual MtGox servers.
Apart from that, MtGox should have a large but simple firewall at their network border, which is setup to only let traffic from &amp; through the Prolexic network through and block everything else.
If this setup is done properly - and Prolexic are not idiots, I imagine they routinely audit both sides of the network infrastructure to prevent holes in their defense - the chance of the **actual** MtGox servers being ddosed is very slim.

I don't think a society could ever function without taxes; stuff like emergency services, healthcare, education, infrastructure maintenance wouldn't be able to run on charity. But then again almost everywhere in the world the interests of the politicians making the budget plans don't quite seem to align with those of the general public.
How cool would it be to have a form of democracy where you can literally vote with your wallet? Instead of voting for a party or specific candidate, voting would entail dividing the available budget over all proposed departments and projects. There would still be room for political parties in this system: each of them would submit their own budget plan ahead of the elections, and voters who don't have the time, knowledge or interest to create their own budget plan would be able to chose one of the templates submitted by the different parties.

Try opening  (the IP belonging to mtgox.com). The page will load nearly instantly, but you'll get a warning from your browser that the SSL certificate is invalid (as it belongs to 'mtgox.com' and not to '72.52.5.67'). Though as soon as you tell your browser to ignore the warning and connect anyway, your request times out.
This almost certainly tells us that the public-facing part of their infrastructure (hosted by prolexic; the part a ddos would target) is functioning perfectly fine, but that the servers actually responsible for handling your request (hosted by mtgox and not facing the public internet) are down.
Ergo, this is indeed most likely not the result of a ddos but simply a case of malfunctioning servers at MtGox, be it because of a maintenance, a screwup or any other reason.

Well, of course an induced panic - if sustained long enough - can eventually turn into an actual panic, just like in a traditional bank-run. But that doesn't change the fact that someone is manipulating you.
