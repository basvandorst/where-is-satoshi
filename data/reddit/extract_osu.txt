He hasn’t only thought about them now, it’s been an ongoing thing but I think he gave up on trying to get them back because he thought it would be impossible so I’m reaching out to r/bitcoin because a few people think they might actually be able to get it back for him, also he bought them when they were worth $0.02 each and planned on selling them when they got to about a dollar each

Personally, I wouldn’t deem losing 1050 bitcoins as lucky, but that’s just me
