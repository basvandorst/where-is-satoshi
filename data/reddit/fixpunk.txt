Beginning Industrialization, Brand new markets, Exploding population and immigration...
The negative factors (few as they were to the gains) with the subsequent Boom ARE NOT due to lack of regulation.
Things can be very confusing with rapid expansion.
Go back to the old Week long Gox chart.
Now imagine that is the US.
$.01  - Wilderness and Indians..
Boom to $30 - Right after the Revolutionary war.
Boom to $250 -  Industrial Revolution
Boom to $1240 - Oil and Technology
There is always going to be those who got burned on the highs....   And there is always going to be confusion, exploitation, and mismanagement in those times.   However the market adapts...

SR1 had more protection than SR2.    And the government happened to SR1.   Besides, what do you expect from a black market.
And Gox's repeated failures have always been due to pure incompetence.
But if you think the people running the companies like Bitstamp and Coinbase are like those that ran Gox...   You should probably abandon ship.

People have already voted with their feet.
Gox at one point had 70% of the market.  For the last year people have been leaving in droves to other exchanges, and those most reliable exchanges like Bitstamp and Coinbase have benefited the most from it.
The point is that the community needs to get even more strict with its standards, and make those feelings known to the bigger exchanges who have already capitalized on reputation, and have more opportunity to do so now.

Amount of wealth has nothing to do with ideology.    There are mega rich with wildly differing mindsets.
My public school taught nothing of the sort and very much demonized the idea of the free market.
Corporate welfare is just as bad/evil as public welfare.
Also there are no mid or early capitalists...   Just capitalists.   If you believe government intervention is good/needed for an economy then you are not a capitalist.   Call those who believe in a mixed economy/keynesian economics, whatever you will, but capitalist is not the definition.

Most of Jim's books seem kind of simple, and are great for beginners, but a joy to read for investing vets as well.

A Bull in China: Investing Profitably in the World's Greatest Market
Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World's Best Market 
A Father's Lessons for Life and Investing, is not really an investing book, but a good read regardless...
A bull in China, is a great roadmap for anyone looking to start adding Asia to their portfolio.
Hot Commodities, again a bit basic for commodity vets, but still has some good/rational nuggets in there that make good food for though.    A must for anyone starting to trade commodities.

  The same reason why all goods get cheaper and better over time in a free market.  The computer you're writing on not only wouldn't exist 30 years ago, but if it did it would be extremely expensive.

Rearden wanted to see His metal, Rearden metal in every bridge, rail, skyscraper, car, sink, pluming, in the world.   If he had jacked the price up to the rate of his competitors or more. Then that still leaves room for an alternative.     You could buy the best, or the cheapest.     Rearden made that choice easy...  You could have both.  Rearden Metal.

No one says there is not demand.   She is stating that the rate is not determined by market forces, but rather the government and insiders.
Note the key word there: "**artificial** expansion of the money supply required to support deficit spending."   Guns and Butter anyone?!
The late 70's early 80's inflation is completely the result of easier money policies for Nixon's re-election in 1972, taking the dollar off its last link to gold, and price controls that strangled production, most notably of now higher priced, or non-existent Oil and gas which then sent further inflation ripples though the whole economy.
Inflation + Regulation(most notably Price controls) = Supply shock &amp; shortages.
Price controls without inflation *already being present* would have no effect.  
When supply shock happens in a free economy(always due to natural events or disasters), the supply is regenerated nearly instantaneously due to the profit motive, which then in turn brings prices back down.   Outside of Natural events and disasters...   Negative Supply shock doesn't happen without government interference, or strangulation of the means of production.   
Also, before it is mentioned...   Yes OPEC was a big factor, but these problems started before 1973, and continued to rise after the embargo was over.  
The powerkeg is the combination of these factors.  Inflation + Regulation(most notably Price controls) = Supply shock &amp; shortages. X OPEC embargo =  Rapid inflation
  Transportation standstill, businesses shutting down, lack of investment capital, which then lowers production and increases inflation further. 
Without lose money and price controls, the OPEC embargo would of been a blip on the radar.  
With a free economy...   Interest rates would of rose, oil would have skyrocketed, and then investment capital would of poured in to access and tap every other source in the world to meet demand, which in turn would of brought prices down.  
That didnt happen.

"Scamming, by the way, is a feature of free markets like this"
Are you kidding?!  Scamming happens with or without regulation.  The difference is in a free market your reputation means everything, and you have to constantly prove yourself to gain large amounts of trust.    In regulated finance all you need is a thumbs up from the SEC and you can scam Billions of dollars away.  No one need watchdog or investigate...   The SEC says they're cool.
Transaction malleability was fixed AFTER if became an noteworthy issue within a weekend.
Scamming and, Pump and dumps...  are down due to community maturity, watch dogs, and a strong emphasis on security.
Black markets like silk road are caused by government regulation, and prevent safe and trustworthy competition in the marketplace for those products.
And even IF gox does go down, there has already been a mass exodus leave the exchange over the last year.  Those that stuck around and trusted the exchange did so at their own risk.
What few free market examples there are like early Hong Kong also had issues they very quickly overcome...   Now a packed and thriving trade and cultural center.
Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, and unregulated...

Also the point of this was to compare a exchange fail to a bank fail.    Bitcoin itself is as secure as cash(which can be stolen) and there are other precautions you can take to make it much more secure.   And by secure I'm talking about security and nothing else.
I think you've mistaken me for a Bitcoin fan.    I'm a fan of the attempt...   and the very innovative free market sandbox and there might emerge a competing digital currency that for whatever reason is superior to every other currency in the world(which would be cool).   But I think Bitcoin's structure is fundamentally wrong.
What most bitcoiner's don't understand is that bitcoin's currency/economy is not built around commodities(gold,silver), or assets and production(government backing)...Thus that makes the exchanges the centers of the bitcoin community.   There is no value/credit structure... The only thing it is tied to is the $(and other currencies)...    Its diminishing supply makes it forever deflationary against the dollar, its hording makes it even more deflationary.  And thats going to continue to happen...  To what end?  IDK...
But at the end of the day NO ONE can walk up to a food vendor on the street and give a good explanation why their apples are worth 1 BTC,  .001BTC, or 0BTC.
OHH!  It promotes instant &amp; cheap transfer of money to anywhere in the world!

First FDIC covers 250,000.
Second, the first version of it(FSLIC) was recapitalized with taxpayer money several times, with $15 billion in 1986 and $10.75 billion in 1987, and became insolvent during the savings and loan crisis.
Third, Banks that are FDIC insured have more automatic assumption of trust and are more likely to fail as a result.   During the 08-2010 Financial Crisis, 552 banks were in trouble, 157 bains were insolvent and failed, for a total loss of 92 Billion.
To the FDIC.   A 10% capital ratio is well capitalized.    WELL CAPITALIZED!    That shit would never fly in bitcoin.  
It is important to note that while the government maintains the fiction of a “fund” to cover such losses, in a bank crisis the losses are imposed on the taxpayers. Today in the US, for example, the FDIC has a tiny reserve to cover an enormous deposit base.
With the FDIC in place, there is no incentive for people to research and find good, strong banks. People shop for the highest interest rates without any regard to the banks' soundness. This gives the bank no incentive to be smart about their investment policies. In fact, it's often the banks that are doing the dumbest things and have the low ratings that are offering the highest interest rates. And those banks attract the most customers and become the largest banks. You have only to look around at what's happening in the banking industry for ample evidence.

First was World War II and Bretton Woods....
Then fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the Vietnam War(and Great Society programs) ...payments deficits.  AGAIN... Guns and butter.  (Already well inflated expenditure before the jump in the 70s)
And the monetary inflation of the 1960s...
The combination of the above causing the dumping of the dollar for physical gold, the drain of US gold, and the London Gold Pool collapse.
Then by 1971, the money supply had increased by 10% and the there was a run on US gold as nations began to leave Bretton Woods and the US withdraw of the last attachments to the gold standard in response. (The only alternative being the reduction of government expenditure, and monetary tightening... Which didn't happen)
Then there was Nixons freezing wages and prices.
And then OPEC in 1973.
Volker's raising of short-term interest rates slowed monetary growth and was the only thing that stalled the upward spiral.
(To be continued....)

She saw dictatorships being devoid of rights, and thus gave moral allowance to due so if rational, similar to how the Union invaded the Confederacy in the United states.
For instance:






































































She would of HATED Bush and Obama alot.   Not just for international policy, but very very much for domestic. 
And no she wasn't a libertarian...  You could call her such as a political comparison, but she combined Politics and morality and thus was offended by Libertarians.      
"The essence of capitalism’s foreign policy is free trade—i.e., the abolition of trade barriers, of protective tariffs, of special privileges—the opening of the world’s trade routes to free international exchange and competition among the private citizens of all countries dealing directly with one another. During the nineteenth century, it was free trade that liberated the world, undercutting and wrecking the remnants of feudalism and the statist tyranny of absolute monarchies."
"We do need a policy based on long-range principles, i.e., an ideology. But a revision of our foreign policy, from its basic premises on up, is what today’s anti-ideologists dare not contemplate. The worse its results, the louder our public leaders proclaim that our foreign policy is bipartisan.
A proper solution would be to elect statesmen—if such appeared—with a radically different foreign policy, a policy explicitly and proudly dedicated to the defense of America’s rights and national self-interests, repudiating foreign aid and all forms of international self-immolation."

Debt/GDP isn't expenditure or payments deficits is it?
GDP rose as Debt rose.  And GDP rose as both a result of the post WW2 economy(Real rise in production), Bretton Woods and the monetary inflation of the 1960s.(false rise in production)
Guess what...  GDP is attached to what currency...   The $dollar$.  In a inflationary period you really think GDP represents REAL growth?    **That Debt/GDP chart shows the low from 1970 to 1980...  Debt grew, but where was the growth?!     The period where industries were going out of business, prices were skyrocketing, no cars, no jobs, Gas was rationed, the transportation sector was at a standstill, and you call that REAL growth?!**   Stop sipping the keynesian koolaid and look around.   GDP does not reflect real growth, and there is such a thing as inflationary default....     Its the whole reason removal of the gold standard had to be done for Nixon...   The whole world was cashing in the dollar for US gold!
Then as predictable as could be Debt/GDP rose in the 80s with Deflationary corrections from the prior 20 years, and expanding federal expenditures then detached from the dollar's connection to gold.


No one said it was the only cause.   Inflation &amp; deflation happens naturally all the time in the market.   The difference is that when Inflation and deflation happen in the marketplace there are people who move very quickly to fill the void.  When Inflation/Deflation happens through the money supply there is no corrections until years later - See the boom and bust cycle.

Economically there is no difference between authoritarianism and leftism.
A government can either be Authoritarian(restrictive) or permissive... And Authoritarianism(restrictiveness) can only be achieved by force.
Every tax I pay is taken by force.
Every restriction is done by force.
Every regulation is done by force.
American Democrats do tend to be more socially permissive, but are very economically authoritarian.  Republicans are not economically permissive either, but tend to be for mixed economies which the democrats then paint as a false capitalism, and then they tend to be very socially Authoritarian. 
Even with Bitcoin, I'm currently breaking law directed by the SEC by daytrading, even though I'm at 7.2% adv gains per week for the year.
There is no left and right in the context that it is used in the united states, unless you want to call it Authoritarianism VS Freedom in which case you could never call a Republican a right winger because they don't care for freedom either.
Freedom and voluntary association was Rand's mantra, and as such there is no distinction between authoritarianism and leftism.

Oh so 6% is too high?   Why not 2%   Or 1%?!   Why keep anything!?


Yes this was a contributing factor(The federal Community Reinvestment Act is retarded as all get out), as was the loan ratings...   However, they played a small role in comparison to the the main problem(which you see as something good) which was the expansion of credit and over leveraging.
You seem to be under the presumption that using capital is always a good thing, and it can't be destroyed in investment.
There is a direct correlation between the money supply, federal funds rate(pumped prices), and government backing of the loans(kept the appearance of being properly leveraged, and kept credit supply up) with housing prices. 
And while demand and prices continued to skyrocket, balance sheets never could of looked better.  Bad debtor?
 WHO cares!  We'll sell the house and make more money!
And there is the exact same direct correlation with skyrocketing tuition and government backed student loans!
Its an easy formula really.  
Too much credit  = Unnaturally high demand = Overcapitalisation/rising prices = Malinvestment = the destruction of capital.
All of that capital would of been better served...  As you say...   collecting dust.
