Why all of sudden is a PoW change appropriate? Is it to do with the potential of 80%+ of miners changing to SW2X? What would this PoW change actually entail? If the plan is only to lower the difficulty to make it more profitable to mine or stopping the network becoming slow isn't that just admitting defeat in regards to the SW2X HF already?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:30:35
Isn't your whole point of SW activation being a SF because of the fear of as you put it "contentious HF's"?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:19:25
All bitcoin hard forks will share the same genesis block which is why it makes sense to name them bitcoin. Also bitcoin has had many hard forks in the past, so do some research before you spout lies. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:06:03
Wouldn't a PoW change require a HF?
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:35:58
The way the genesis block needed special coding to be mined as it had no reference block to stack onto means he cannot spend the 50BTC reward for mining that block, ever. Unsure about the tx's that it's received since though. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:55:17
None of Satoshi's coins have ever moved, he has an estimated 1 million BTC, Bitcoin Cash and potentially S2X once the HF happens. So you implying he's moved Bitcoin Cash by saying he never moved BTC is kind of silly.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:48:11
Right so how can other companies implement Cores actual code before them? Just seems lazy from them or they're insinuating they have more important things to do than implement SW on the main BTC Client.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:02:13
The whole point of Satoshis white paper was that every single unit is accounted for forever. His idea was that cryptocurrency overtook banking and everyone would follow the blockchain, so eventually everything will be in there. This idea it's only for massive amounts of transactions is perpetuated by trolls who want to keep the block size at 1MB. 
We already rely on others to complete transactions and they're called miners... They're the most powerful players in bitcoin in reality, they could stop all mining and cripple the coin into death spiral. 
Privacy and security benefits are much more included when you use bitcoin. 
It's only inconvenient because of the deva refusing to discuss any sort of HF to increase the block size as it benefits them to push all tx onto side chains that they have patents over. Paying for anything, including coffee, was very much easy and possible with minimal fees until mid 2015 when all merchants started to drop bitcoin support due to massive tx backlog and fees. 
Come on man, just because you increase the block size to relieve the immediate mempool doesn't make it centralised. If you can't afford to download 8MB every 10 mins you have bigger problems than bitcoin being centralised. SPV's were always the plan anyways, non mining nodes are pretty irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:21:36
Either way how can other companies use it faster than Core is beyond me. Maybe too busy writing new POW algos to care about their users.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:28:18
Kind of hard to use segwit when the team that implemented haven't even updated their GUI to include it, not exactly the vote of confidence segwit needs.
Edit: I've been banned, was nice trying to help you guys, hope it all goes well for you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:01:43
Thanks for the reference. 
Why would delaying 0.15.0 have been so bad to actually get SW out to the masses? Like I said the community would understand but it just seems complacent. They've also released 0.15.1 since then and still not SW GUI.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:35:46


This guy seems confident, he knows his shit


Oh no, seems to be buying on emotion, guess he does not indeed know his shit.

So 22mbp which is literally half of any U.K fibre is considered too high... especially when you consider that's 1GB blocks but 2MB is decentralised. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:58:17
PoW is what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin. Changing that would make it an altcoin, the situation is that there are two bitcoins competing now both with different ideologies. BTC has been more profitable than BCH for a while but now it's roles have reversed BTC has approximately 60% of it's normal hash power, miners are looking out for their own interests and mining the most profitable chain which is expected to be honest.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:41:08
Yeah nice one man, resort to insulting my intelligence, that's how all great discussions start.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:13:36
Surely if he bought in 09/10 with $4,000 he'd have at least 4000 BTC, in today's current market that is a hell of a lot more than $14m, I think your math is off. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:07:54
I wasn't arguing I was stating facts man. Plenty of companies implemented segwit addresses and at one point it was over 15% tx capacity so other companies implementing it faster than the actual developers who have been working on it for over a year is a damning indictment no matter what you say.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:35:21
If you want to exchange your BCH for BTC just use the BCH to BTC option and use precise to get a better ratio, you should get confirmation of the BCH arriving pretty much instantly and then the BTC will arrive into your chosen BTC address.

America is not the world, Europe doesn't have bandwidth limits of data caps and certainly will not be having priority network lanes via net neutrality. America got into bed with lobbyists to make the rich richer and the public allowed it. That's not the rest of the worlds fault. People say bitcoin isn't for people who live in less than €X per day so why should it be for people who have limited internet also?

Milenials who happen to have billions to invest, must be nice man!
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:14:17
Oh so Ver and CSW are the ones mining peoples transactions for them? How kind I thought it was miners processing BCH tx's because it's more profitable!
They didn't code it it was other developers such as Amaury that did. Some of the people in the current BTC github have history of being authoritarian scammers and bullies but I won't mention names due to risk of being banned.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:03:11
SegWit has been on testnet for over a year and on mainnet for 3 months, very incompetent to not have a GUI implement available straight after activation nevermind 3 months later in reality.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:46:43
I recommend next time you look at the history further than the last few months before resorting to name calling and actually listen to the other people on the board before being rude then.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:26:20
You seriously the amount of investment that has gone into Bitcoin from so many big funds has no idea what 150say/byte means? That's just disrespectful to investors who've probably forgotten more about markets than you know now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:32:16
The demonisation of the Coffee has been blown out of proportion to give people to gall to say that BTC is only a store of value now and that coffees dont deserve to be on the ledger. Why shouldn't they be on the ledger? If the whole world converts to cryptocurrency, which is the eventual aim to overthrow the corrupt bankers, the coffee payment should be in the ledger with EVERY other transaction no matter how important of meaningless, once you decide things don't belong in the ledger then it's no longer a useful currency. You need the full history of every coin to confirm the blockchain is correct. Why shouldn't I be able to use BTC as a digital cash which was it's original intention.
As the argument for BTC as a store of value continues to grow the more I believe it will suffer a great downfall. It's not for anyone to say who can and cannot transact in BTC and it's not for anyone to say what is spam (coffee). No transaction is any more important than another one. Once you start thinking like that you get priority side chains for the rich, basically Net Neutrality argument based in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:41:58
Given that you resorted to assuming i have "no fucking clue" you seem to be back tracking quite a bit right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:15:10
I said I have no opinion on CSW's claims as he has provided no proof, I never said I believed it so don't strawman. I said the technology him and his team are developing is great irrelevant of who he is.
Cores who business plan was a fee market, do some research. So you're claiming that 58mb of the mempool is spam, which would mean anything below 10sat/byte is scam, that's your opinion without facts to back it up so don't portray it as facts mate. Even if you were correct 500sat/byte is outrageous fees to pay for any tx.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:31:54
So Core devs owe thanks to miners for activating SW yet refused to hold up the 2X part and constantly berate the miners saying they aren't important? Seems hypocritical.
So you're saying the Core devs work for free? Except the ones employed directly by BlockStream which is a conflict of interest as their whole business revolves around sidechains that charge for use. You're also implying the Core devs can do what they want without consulting the community, this is incorrect if they go against a large portion of the community the large portion can fork off, as is the case in BCH. It's completely wrong to give total control to a few devs who have conflicting interests and completely trust them, Bitcoin is about trusting no one.
3 months is a hell of a long time, considering in that time the price almost trebled.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:20:21
So you're saying SW didn't even have consensus from devs and that it took miner consensus over SW2X to get it implemented?
Either way devs developed and pushed for it (some devs specifically) and haven't even implemented a GUI segwit address capability 3 months post SW activation. And the fact that other companies have implemented it over the Core devs shows a lack of preparation from Core or pure complacency which shouldn't happen from so called best coders in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:23:13
Yeah 2000 BTC would be worth $14m in the current market, still thought I'd assume he'd have more if he bought in 2009/2010 as it never got to $1 until 2011.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:13:19
Yeah it's going to increase no question about it. But the fact BTC won't even scale above 1MB as some cry of causing centralisation is ridiculous. BTC or BCH can use on and off chain solutions to scale to that tx capacity but if you sit around waiting for that tx capacity to come and do nothing in the mean time, which is what core seems to be doing, BTC will lose masses to other coins such as LTC/BCH/ETH. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:55:37
Fake is a strong word when BCH has massive demand currently and is 3rd in market cap, potentially 2nd soon if things keep on going as they are.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:23:57
No it centralises control in USA, the rest of the world has limitless fibre and will be decentralised still. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:46:20
BCH has a DAA incoming on 13/11 so it will not have wild swings anymore and be much more stable. 
CSW may or may not be who he claims he is, nothing to with me I don't believe any claims without proof. What he has done though is successfully test 1GB in his research which has to be fair very progressive no matter the person behind the advances and research. 
Mining is exactly the same in BCH and BTC, the most profitable and useable chain will win in the end, I have eggs in both baskets so I will see how it goes. In fact if I wanted to transfer from BTC to BCH it would cost me over $100 in fees so I'm sitting on the sidelines until I feel I can transact without having to pay ridiculous fees in the fee market Core wanted. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:53:55
You can only use segwit tx's on Bitcoin Core via the command code centre which is definitely not recommended for people not versed in code. It's also been updated twice since the fork without adding the GUI support which is quite poor from Core imo, they've preached SW will ease fees yet haven't even implemented into their client.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:59:52
I'm not against it becoming an investment part of its value is in its deflationary nature and limited coin supply. Don't be condescending towards people. I don't like the way the space has become literally hodl memes and price rollercoasters. Bitcoin needs to keep being used instead of stagnating on exchanges where no one actually uses bitcoin transaction wise other than to put it on and off an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:16:39
What situation is that?
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:50:04
You want to change your name to Satoahi? That's pretty weird man, you have a complex about being famous I think. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:55:11
Lad I'm from England I know what gutted is. You just seem to be using rose tinted glasses, Silk Road made bitcoin more famous than anything else, without it I doubt it is aa big as it is today. Good for you spending hardly any bitcoin but that's not the purpose of it, it's a currency, you don't hold GBP hoping it will gain in value. I don't like bitcoin becoming an 'investment' fund basically, it's not gold. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:58:00
It's not about what it's worth in 3 years mate, it's about using the cryptocurrency as intended, to purchase goods and every tx that does that is proof of it working. A lot of people have bought things in the past that will now be worth fortune, the 5000 BTC pizza is infamous, it's better to spend and buy back than to just hold as a store of value in my opinion. 
The more transactions we get through the network the better, obviously high fees do not help but once the everyday joe wants to use cryptos to buy a regular coffee they should be able to do that as is their right.
If everyone held and never spent BTC wouldn't be worth anything!
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:03:14
No miners would mean no transactions get confirmed at all... I'm not sure if you think nodes can process transactions into blocks because they can't. If not transactions get through the currency is useless and worth $0.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:51:40
Hmm, so if this event of 50% miners left for any reason at the very start of a difficulty period, leaving 50% hash rate would be it would take 1 month for difficulty algo to adjust, 1 month is a massive amount of time in crypto world, as we seen with Ethereum this year, if BTC is floundering with high tx count, major backlog and massive fees another tech will eat up some of BTC's market. BTC will hopefully be around forever but these statements you're making a wild at best. Miners are an important part of the network security no matter who says otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:46:33
That's quite hyperbolic is there was only 1 tx per day that'd mean there was something majorly wrong with the market/network and I highly doubt it'd retain its value at that tx output. 
It's not big block FUD I like on chain scaling but BTC is currently on a different route which may work and that's no problem at all, that's the current Devs vision. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:42:12
Not really considering it was supposed to be an upgrade to the network via hardfork not a chain split, so there wouldn't be a futures market if Core had agreed to the 2mb increase. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:24:41
Without that pizza guy being one of the very first real world transactions would we even be where we are today?
Everyone can look back with rose tinted glasses and say it'd be worth X now I'm so silly but I bought things that will be worths thousands now and I don't regret it at all.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:10:56
You just said loss of mining power will never hurt the price, I took it literally and said no miners means $0.
If you want to go the route of half hash power, the tx backlog would be ridiculous, fees would be ridiculous, people would flock to alternative solutions and BTC price would go down, so even then it will affect the price. Miners secure the network so they make the price increase/decrease with their actions.

Maybe, I thought it could be that, how would I go about fixing this issue?
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:02:36
Yeah I accidentally used the lowest recommended transaction fee when doing the transaction. It still has not gone through unfortunately, I looked at the site and it states 1-10 should take 100 minutes? What does it mean when it says medium priority and should be done within 6 blocks?
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:27:25
It's 0.12.1, however I have sorted the issue now by pushing the raw data thanks to the info from the poster above. Thanks for your help anyway!
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:41:25
I don't think the transactions are getting mined unfortunately. I think it may have been a problem with my wallet as well because they never actually left. How long until the transactions are refunded do you think?
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:48:48
Yeah I will try another private wallet first before doing online only. Hopefully those transactions eventually go through, thanks again for all your help!
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:15:38
Yeah thanks. I tried to do another transaction from the wallet with 0.0006BTC/kB and it broadcast through 2 nodes and when I searched on blockchain.info it gave me this error "Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: The transaction is not final"
Starting to worry about the software I have and none of the four transactions i've tried to send out have been confirmed or even made it onto blockchain by theirselves without me copying the raw transaction data and pushing the tx.
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:07:47
Yeah strange, might just stick to circle and coinbase from now on, hopefully I sort out the mess of this wallet first!
