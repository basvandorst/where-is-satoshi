You do know BTC can be bought in fractions- say 0.0000001 BTC- come on now... Claiming there is a lack of accessibility due to price is just simply ignorance of math....
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:52:40
You know, nearly every wallet shows BTC in relation to the local currency. So if you are spend 0.10cents USD it shows that and you don't have to even do math...
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:43:42
Ok fair enough, your point makes more sense. Exchange prices are different across geographies due to lack of liquidity (ability for one exchange to arbitrage to another). Yes, that is indeed an challenge for adoption, and major players (Bitfinex, Coinbase, etc...) are working to solve that. Shouldn't be much longer until price globally stabilizes (before Q4 is my expectation).

@_date: 2014-01-06 21:31:54
De-web (de-centralized) web will come i'm quite sure of it. The best solution would be a p2p, encrypted, obfuscated, overlay leveraging http / restful architecture... all you need is something to bring the bits back together from all the p2p nodes to enable rendering on a standard browser. All the pieces are in place for a fully decentralized, privacy-centric, counter-party resistant web solution.
Build a distributed transaction protocol on top of free-net and mature usability and it'll be the next leap in the internet.

Comments:Dear Amazon, 
  I am no longer interested in using Fiat currency. I am interested only in Bitcoin and crypto currencies. Most of my purchases are through Amazon and I'd like to keep my business with you. If you do not start accepting Bitcoin and / or other crypto currencies, I will take my business to Overstock.com. 
Thank you for your consideration, and hopefully you will implement Bitcoin or crypto-currency so I can keep my business with Amazon. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:39:38
Yeah go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:11:25
No, of course not. Just a problem statement for fiat, not really a problem :).
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:58:35
You do need a CC for coinbase instant bitcoin, in addition to your bank account + identity verification...
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:45:05
It is, do you have anything rational to contradict the theory?
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:11:37
lol... so the crime was he traded some dude some money (btc), and this other party did whatever they wanted with them... how is that a crime?
If someone said; I want to trade some cash for your garage-sell items and i'm going to do illegal crap- I'd say; your business son, not mine. No laws force you to stop a crime, let a lone a theoretical crime that you have no evidence of.
Of course the government doesn't really care- they're just pissed they aren't getting a percentage.

Nealy impossible scenario, even for the Chinese... The math doesn't pan out. We'd see China sucking up all the ASICs and creating droughts that we'd fork BTC, if we had too. This much compute, especially in ASICs, everyone will notice...

No such thing as intrinsic value... value is always relative to the person who desires it.

yeap, I manage a team of over 300 with 12 directs.
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:47:27
Live it everyday. I don't even think about laws, it just so happens Im not irrational and thus not violent. For everything else the state thinks is worth using violence against me(aka: illegal) I risk mitigate... If you live your life the way a murdering thief wants you to (Government) then your not really living are you?
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:46:05
Uh yes it is. Its a huge Bitcoin risk if the government is ceasing assets because of "money laundering" via crypto currencies. If you don't like it, you can make your own bitcoin sub and try to moderate the ahit out of it and see how many people participate. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:46:48
Just let someone else trade your $$, you must not even use a stop loss... Geez dude.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:52:16
Just want a reviewable (user rating) location of all cryptocurencies &amp; related apps.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:16:08
So no such thing as being alive and not producing value... Or you'd be a the if or die.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:46:53
Agreed on the notion of decentralized everything. As innovation drives to commoditization it brings with it individualized freedom and self autonomy.
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:28:38
Similar costs, sans liability (depending up on state/city/etc). If you were to do a proper "uber" model for Bitcoin, it would be localbitcoins w/ proper gps (ideally decentralized), MyCellium already does that :). Just lacks the marketing / awareness.
The long-term solution is certainly p2p apps connecting individuals. I'd focus on the real solution and breaking down barriers to it, instead of ATMs which will die as the ecosystem is evolving so rapidly.

Sure, you can build decentralized solutions for anything. CPS should be abolished and the decentralized solution to replace it is called neighbors...
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:09:11
Its called a free market 3rd party arbitrator, unlike the irrational immediate jump to violence that CPS and centralized government provide. Also you have a choice, as with any dynamic critical incident; are you wiling to use force to defend someone else? I'd be more incliend to see an individual and neighbor who is directly exposed to the problem (more benevelantly incentivised than government) to make choices about the use of force, than some centralized mafia(Government), incentivsed by theft of one's past(wealth), present (freedom), and future (life).
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:22:14
Says the person that can't explain it lol
@_date: 2015-05-09 05:04:13
Uh did you not read what I said above? You think no one on the planet can be a fair arbiter, then why would someone in government be. Plus I already answered this, care to try again with a rational and followup question?

@_date: 2014-07-06 04:50:59
The problem is related to fiat losing it's value because of bitcoin- he's historically and obviously bullish on alt-currencies, crypto or otherwise.

What a retard post. You mean, you f'd up and lost money and your blaming bitfinex... Dude... Why the retarded title?

Probably the latter and its a compelling reason to buy it.
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:36:58
Not at all, it would be structured on crowd concensus, similar to Bitcoin. Developers are not some magical Jesus...

Too much overhead and regulation; KYC, PCI, all the brick &amp; moarter regulations, employee regulations, insurance, etc...
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:23:36
Sure those are more likely yo be efficient &amp; effective. Do want to check on regulations though, you'd likely have to do $$ to "btc-card-coupons" then to BTC. Any form of money exchange is heavily regulated...
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:38:16
My concern is about one of the most important aspect: the actual store node, which if taken out means the merchant is down and likely compromised... That's a huge issue.

@_date: 2015-05-16 13:32:25
You can't be found unless you're dumb enough to leak personally identifiable information. Posting your BTC addy, using clearnet, etc. Everyone should know by now that the blockchain stores all tx in the clear and any move between wallets can be correlated with some degree of accuracy. The only way to get caught and convicted is other incriminating information. This stuff is all part of a FUD campaign- dont be fooled and study your threat vectors.

Go do some research: your taxed on a Roth up front- which makes your argument even weaker:
"You paid tax on that income when you first contributed to the Roth IRA. If the withdrawal is made before age 59 and 1/2 and is only up to the amount that has been contributed to the Roth IRA then no income tax is charged. Withdrawals of contributions are tax-free."
There is no such thing as tax free...
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:35:36
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:05:33
Meaning, not stupid, legacy businesses. Real businesses are interested in producing rational value, generally not using violence (Greek origin of the word- "to violate") to produce value. Hence people who can produce value are seen as partners, not indentured servants.
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:18:13
Real businesses want partners, not drones, people who are dedicated to the mission don't need 9-5 + holidays, they work when they need to, enjoy hobbies when they need to, and take care of their personal life when they need to.
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:51:23

Sounds shitty to me. Stopped reading @ centralized. But very funny ;)
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:28:15
You'd eventually find one. Its better than looking to the mob (government) and asking them for a violent solution. I don't agree with government as an arbiter... So instead of two parties have to pick one that we both agree to, I get a gun pointed at me from the Government...
There is no altertaive to free market arbitration, other than violence. For sake of argument you say; "OK, your fine with violence", then why even have government? Just let the two parties use violence between themselves and cut all the cost and  errors out of a centralized 3rd party violence agency (Government). 
Government can only provide violence as an answer, free markets have infinite answers.
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:53:47
That's readily apparent based on your mystical understanding of software development lol
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:34:02
Good that it highlights the biggest flaws with OB: its distributed, not decentralized and not multi-hop. Freenet is better than this thing...
@_date: 2015-05-31 04:37:24
Neither. If you have no capital and your trying to run a node or get food, you either have to steal or be provided charity and thus you are a loser either way.
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:16:46
Can't sell them "tax free" in either case: (tax deferred IRA) or on the open market. Capital Gains tax would kick in if you had no other income at retire in scenario 1 (10-20% if you do your write-offs correctly). 
Income tax would kick in on your scenario 2. Assuming you only were making income off bitcoin and had no other revenue and you made 60-70k, you'd be taxed at about 35% (not including state tax)...
Bottom line a tax deferred asset is worth about 20-30% premium due to the fact you likely have less income when you retire and be taxed less and who knows- maybe we can dissolve government by then... you never know....
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:45:55
Lol wow... Epic fail.
@_date: 2015-05-02 06:10:07
So they built a battery with a pretty cover... Uh....
@_date: 2015-05-02 05:31:28
A court run by the mob that is the Government and enforced by their guns... yeah, violence makes it rational... lol. Who cares.
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:04:50
Doesn't work on mobile or do I need to sign in?
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:15:34
Only way that would work (assuming that just being alive, means no other means of productivity) is if we turned said people into energy generators- exercise to convert energy into compute. So they would just be "alive" they'd be producing value by working out and powering compute...
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:17:21
Always good for both parties or the trade would never have happened. Value is subjective and relative in time. Unless there is violence (like the government involved), then there is only losers.
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:03:22

@_date: 2015-08-26 15:21:06
Money == speech in action. There is no such thing as separation of it from anything. What he really means to say is; that Government (centralized-violence) cannot exist- due to incentives for leveraging centralized violence for one's own means via Money.

Thank you for that information, much appreciated.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:20:01
The store node sits solely on one node, your computer, a server, etc (your node). Thus your store can be compromised (since it doesn't reside behind Tor &amp; can't route through ATM). It exposes the vendor to significant risk. It's centralized for performance reasons. They should look at Freenet for decentralized store node solutions (again, it won't be super-fast if w/o some optimization / caching)...
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:10:52
I think you can make bets on it's Alpha version...
There is even a very similar bet already:

@_date: 2015-08-19 02:25:12
Not true at all, has to do with both. The trigger was the fork, the length of the short was losses on long-positions getting liquidated. There is still a bearish trend caused by the uncertainty due to this fork.
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:19:01
So should open bazaar their store nodes (the most important nodes) are still centralized.
@_date: 2015-08-31 15:31:54
T-mobile has been fighting these issues since they started flat-rate-unlimited data nearly a decade ago. They are upset at what they see are "parasite" users, who use their "pipes" 100% of the time.
Most people use data less than 10-20% which what their business model is based on, with minimal outliers above.
Bottom line, if they don't like it, they need to change their business model. Ledger is a marketing genius, but a typical CEO.

To be clear, I love OpenBazaar and it has a great many use-cases. Just think there is a huge gap for truly censorship resistant use-cases. 
Say I'm selling the bible in most non-tollerent cuntires, with the current implementation I could be tracked, arrested, &amp; my store taken down. Not very functional for 1/3 of the commerce on the planet.
@_date: 2015-08-30 19:16:30
Except the store node... To be truly p2p, all capabalities of the software must be completely distributed &amp; autonomous... Just because a given user store Node resides on his own span of control does not make it decentralized- his store Node only exists in one place (centralized in my opinion). Bottom line the risk vector is the issue and we both agree.
Tactically integration w/ Tor would be a great start... Finding cost-effective (rendering efficient) way to distribute HTTP chunks is difficulty. Makes me think a new protocol is needed, but that's a lot of work.

Actually no, opinions are simply people who don't understand facts and critical thinking. The real answer is the study of human incentives. Government has no value plain and simple- it is by its very functional, logically, mathmatically- negative value. All things considered to be of value can simply be handled by the free market.

But why would it... if the value is paired against the USD, why wouldn't they just ask for more BTC (dollar equivalent)... since the USD is the currency their targets poses anyway...
Example: hacker asked for 1000$ usd equivalent last year when BTC was 500$, they would have given 2BTC, now they would give ~4BTC. It's not like their targets (police organizations: aka mafia w/ good marketing) are using BTC. Their currency is USD...

Investment is not the same as build &amp; execution, government steals everyone's money (via taxes), then gives the money to their friends (private contractors) which give them kick backs and waste efficiency, but the private market actually builds the roads. Not the government. The amount of employees whom actually work for government building or even designing the roads is minuscule- it's all contracted out. 
Besides about 90% of all roads are privately build to connect from some government abomination of a road (highways, etc.). Most roads actually originate from home building, natural resource extraction (forest roads), etc., so the market really builds most the roads anyway- what's another 10%...

I'm sure it's an attempt to influence indirectly. All people who wish to destroy value, have to employ a heterogeneous strategy and plant the seeds of potential destruction, long before they pull the trigger.
Is this a risk, sure, will it directly affect the code base anytime soon, not likely. But all the more reason to publicly audit on regular basis (quarterly).
Someone should create a crowd source- auditing site, where you gamify the auditing of code publicly and incentivise it via BTC.

Exactly, why would Overstock shoot itself it the foot, it benefits from wider BTC adoption. Has much more of an uphill battle and less likely margins to build net-new.

Functionally that's true, but that's not how you define architecture models. Models are ideal and if you deviate from them, you've created a hybrid model. Now functionally it may solve most of your requirements or threat models, but it certainly isn't "decentralized." This term is being thrown around like "Cloud" because its cool, while developers haven't invested the time to build real Decentralized software.
Cloud in a lot minds is off-prem, in others its hybrid, yet others its about services. The reality is that, like the word decentralized, you have to build something novel for it to have a new name.
Very little software is truly decentralized due to latency issues (ATM).

Just since WWII (which I have to go find some good numbers of how many the US has murdered previously):
In the last 50 years, the United States has promoted, financed and participated in over 200 incursions and 20 separate wars, killing over 8,000,000 people.
1952 - 79, 70,000 Iranians killed. ( Ayatollah Khomeini, US public enemy for the 1980s, was on the CIA payroll while in exile in Paris in 1970s, as were Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden at different times and in different places. )
1954 - 120,000 Guatemalans killed
1954 - 1975, 4,000,000 Vietnamese and Cambodians killed.
1965 - 3,000 Dominican Republicans killed
1965 - 800,000 Indonesians killed
1973 - 30,000 Chileans killed
1975 - 250,000 East Timorese killed
1970s - 1,000,000 Angolans killed
1984 - 30,000 Nicaraguans killed
1980s - 80,000 El Salvadoreans killed
1989 - 8,000 Panamanians killed in an attempt to capture George H. Bush's CIA partner now turned enemy, Manuel Noriega,
1980s - over 700,000 Libyans, Grenadians, Somalians, Haitians, Afghanistanis, Sudanese, Brazilians, Argentineans and Yugoslavians killed,
1991 - over 1,000,000 Iraqis killed, including over 500,000 children -- about which Madeline Albright ( then, Secretary of State ) said "their deaths are worth the cost". While George W. Bush owns over 80% of the oil wells in Kuwait, trouble will continue there.

you mean a free market place... it just so happens because of the government that there is a vacuum for drugs. Nothing wrong with someone providing a market place. What people do with it is their business. Secondarily, there is no victim, how can there be a crime?
You sir, scare me with your ignorance.

Howto make government irrelevant through competition in the private market
De-fund: Attacking the cancer - Escape, legally, as many taxes as possible.
0) Get out of debt- cut the cord.
1) Call a tax lawyer and say; "i'll give you all my would-be tax dollars, if you can keep me from paying taxes."
2) Educate people to only work as independent contractors, so they can better control their revenue (income) and have more legal-flexibility with their taxes.
3) Encourage, participate, and move to "free-state" projects. Coalesce as many free minded people as possible in particular areas so that you can realize freedoms in your lifetime.
4) Stop enslaving your children- no longer label your children w/ Birth Certs, SS, DL, etc...
Educate: Understand the cancer
5) Homeschool your children!
6) Educate everyone, &amp; often... take a page from Mormons; take a day every weekend / weeknight to go door to door, teaching people about freedom, along with your friends, internet, etc...
Empower: Enable tools to remove the cancer
7) Start a business that drives the free market. Example; create a localized road building org, telling the individuals of a given city- you'll do the roads without giving taxes to the government. You can even create roads directly on private property, and charging tolls, as necessary.
8) Use alternative "monies" bitcoin, physical commodities; gold, silver, copper, bullets, rice, etc.
 Learn &amp; become self sufficient (off-the-grid); learn to grow your own food, get a farm(if possible) or buy directly from local farms, decentralized power (solar,wind,water), hunting/fishing, survival.
Political Action: Squeezing the cancer
9) Continue to only vote NO on everything (if you're "papered") &amp; try to vote in people reducing the size of government.
