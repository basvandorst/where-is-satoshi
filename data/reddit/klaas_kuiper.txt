Well yeah i’m stacking sats. But idk what is gonna happen with crypto during a recession and nobody does. We can only speculate. I think it will take the same route as gold does during a recession, being used as a hedge against other markets.

Authorities are currently working on having a regulation in place which will get introduced in the beginning of 2020. As far as i know, i’ve spoken with a few financial advisors from different banks and 4/5 said to have a small portion of your capital in crypto. So it’s moving to the right direction imo, although i don’t know if “the real powerful” are in it themselves.

I’m sick of explaining to my friends/strangers how bitcoin works, and they don’t do shit with it. I’m currently writing a book about the basics you need to know. And i’ll just give that to them and it’s up to them if they do something with it or not. can’t do much more than that without coming over as a shill imo.

So i’m dutch and i’ve attended many crypto talks in amsterdam and utrecht. I can say that our country is pretty far in this space compared to others. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a second solution in the form of a digital currency next to gold when the current financial system collapses.

Time to sell

That’s right, but it doesnt have to be regular intervals, can also be price points. I DCA’d from 6k,5.5k,5k etcetc works like a charm in the long run.

True that, let it correct a little bit and ill dca on the way down

Nice, you launched your website earlier than mine!! Had the same idea man. I want to spread the awareness of crypto too with aparel! Great to see someone have the same idea as me. I’m launching my site in about 2 weeks when i get regulatory approval, cant wait!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:51:47
Yeah but how many people actually pulled that off, i mean everyone was way to bearish at that time to put down 32k+. That’s like saying you shouldve been more aware of bitcoin in 2011 and bought some then. It’s all good brotha atleast you got some! Just push some money aside each month and buy some that is what i did and paid off
