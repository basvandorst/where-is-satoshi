I think it's a valid thing to bring up. It's a new thing that happened only because of Bitcoin, and I believe it was a big part of the early period of btc.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:32:20
so you can say it's not a bubble and be okay, the sub is full of those. right?
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:57:27
People in Asia, or a Bot operating when the USA isn't active are buying every Bitcoin they can see. Probably +300K USD has been spent tonight on bitcoins.

no to be an asshole, but working in video- this is the same first idea a lot people have. It's funny because I've made videos like this too.
But I could get behind a video about Satoshi in a hero- comic book kind of light. But I'd have to ditch the first line.
I'd love to see some concept drawings of Satoshi the hero.

Dude I wish I never bought that 1/2 ounce. Keep the coins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:31:50
So you managed to download the mining software, join a pool, mine for 12 hours but didn't actually take the time to understand that basic fact that you can't earn anything anymore? I don't get how thats even possible. Who told you to do that? Why are people doing this?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:27:48
I'm thinking about starting a new sub where it is okay to discuss the downside of bitcoin. it's not allowed here. Any ideas for the name? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:11:00
In what way? I'm working on something currently. If you have an idea of a part two that would be cool.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:56:18
I've read it's a bad idea because of charge backs. I would look for other ways to get BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:04:21
The problem is dumb posts. Image macros are just part of the problem.
It's only bad on "crash days", like today, otherwise the sub seems okay.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:40:36
well you just moved them out of there didn't you? do you need them back in?
there's an option to not pay the fee. It's in the client settings. Also, the fee is only a couple of cents right? I've never really been too concerned with the fees myself

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:05:15
Again with fucking mining. Every time. DO NOT MINE if you are new and don't know anything. 
Get a wallet at blockchain.info or download the entire blockchain(10gb) with the original bitcoin client.

Weird you said that, I'm working on one. I made a post about it last night

Totally, I've been waiting for something like this.
It would be a new way to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:57
No one here knows. It is essentially impossible to know for sure.
Everyone is just guessing, making dumb posts about what the think and feel.
It's a fucking god damn circus. 
But your premise is good, it is true that someone or group could have had a large enough stack in the network to make it more volatile. That is one of many possible things.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:33:38
I don't know about everyone else but when I got on board with btc it wasn't about being in a volatile market. "investing" meant creating useable features not pouring dollars in the market. I want a good alternative currency that solves problems that exist with credit cards, paypal, ect. I don't want to be part of a network that does things like today. If there was an other crypto that proved it was stable I would use it in a heartbeat.
Sorry I'm mad, today really pissed me off. I'm just starting to think that these episodes aren't in-fact growing pains but actual "game breaking" bugs.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:14:11
The lag is crazy, I'm lagging by 5 minutes
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:58:01
That's still an insanely high amount of growth, back it out and look at it from six months.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:49:36
You scan them like a regular barcode with an app on your phone. Bitcoin apps use the scanner app to read what the code has embedded in it. They can have plain text, a hyper link, an email address, ect... 
It's basically a way to have a "clickable link" in the real world, like in a subway, a mall, flyer. Bitcoin actually seems to be a good fit for the technology.
Having them on the web is less useful for almost everything except BTC, because you could just use a regular hyper link. But with BTC, some people use their mobile app to send coins so the QR code makes sense as an option.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:55:55
I don't know, LTC just had a pretty massive spike on the Gox speculation. 
Keep in mind Gox is trying to appear more and more legit by teaming with CoinLab. The impression a lot of people have with LTC is that it is not... legit... So Therefore doesn't fit well with Gox. That's my reasoning anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:01:36
I would post on a website that links people up who want to buy/sell at a real world coffee shop or whatever. Cash only. When you met, check to see if he has the cash, he should check to see you account has the coins. When you are both comfortable make the transfer. If you are in a major city you shouldn't have a hard time finding a buyer. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:12:49
any press about today is going to be bad. It doesn't look good. Fuck what the price says that is not the right question to ask.
The question should always be "will the usefulness of the network increase or decrease"
Without a functional network we have nothing.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:01:50
damn dude, congrats, hold on to it*.
Sell a little bit if you already have an account somewhere. Or sell a few to someone local. That way your can ride this thing with out feeling like you missed out. I'd say sell $1200 and wait out for the rest.
@_date: 2013-03-05 05:05:43
I think it makes a wallet for you and PMs you the details. Open it up and transfer the BTC to your main address.

believe it or not there are a few subs with these types of ideas. and a few others.
There is a website called landwatch.com that sells tracks of land for pretty cheap prices. Most are secluded, some aren't.

I have more to add to it, which will give more context. 
But I'm thinking about making another specifically on the benefits of cryptos vs traditional. I'm also thinking about one on cryptography as a whole, the history, technology and how its fucking amazingly advanced it is now.
If I could just find someone to voice these damn things... I have a post out in an other sub, so I'll see how that goes.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:39:44

@_date: 2013-04-09 21:56:39
The mining pools become targets of coordinated attacks and major hashing power is lost in an instant. The network eventually stabilizes once the initial attack subsides. But the lingering effects are that it destabilizes their relationships with each other. They begin to distrust each other, bad intentions multiply. Eventually a war breaks out between the mining factions, the result may be that the major hashing power moves to a "good guy" pool which has too many good guys, over 60%. They are trusted for a while but eventually they get attacked and the network goes to shit. Average users say fuck this and use another Crypto.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:50:02
The other important question would be "and by how much"
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:05:33
yeah, it's a good idea, it could very easily be 10 videos on mining.
The trick is just getting the right depth so that your telling people enoug but not leaving more questions than answers.
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:01:54
Just trying to earn them with my productivity.... working for them. Maybe it helps more to do it this way.
I don't have a large amount. I got here too late to mine, and I only have enough money to gamble at Indian casinos a few times a year.
But if they got down to where I want them I'll start buying them outright.
@_date: 2013-03-05 19:02:49
people donate to charities for all sorts of reasons, pity, financial incentive, because their mom's are walking around somewhere in a group, because their co-worker is running across the country, and because of pure goodness of heart. Do you think the people who receive the donations care *why* the people gave?
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:14:17
Yes a Crypto could come a long a actually prove to be more useful. For what ever reason that may be, it is a plausible scenario. But I doubt it would be a fast change over.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:55:28
I saw one buy for 1240  That bumped it up to $129. That's the biggest one I've seen.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:18:33

@_date: 2013-04-08 17:01:42
That post is 6 days old. Holy shit... the price doubled in 6 days
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:18:02
that's true. I don't really expect it to get back to 20 soon, my post above sort of makes it sound like I expect to it be there soon, but there's a lot of support. 
That's why I'm testing out the idea of freelancing for BTC. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:15:13
its like they have a play book or something
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:06:31
he stole the donation pot? or was it his fee for producing the video?
What happened?
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:13:06
From the many subs that exist with this type of idea the main issue is that there needs to be someone to start the project who has a bankroll. It needs to be someone who has the cash to spend and then invite the people into the project. Collectively buying into a piece of property is too complicated which is why these things haven't worked yet.
If there are a few bitcoin millionaires around here that are interested it would be great. I personally think starting on land is a better way to go. Once established - move off shore.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:36:21
Not yet. They say it's coming. It's needed.
@_date: 2013-03-11 21:43:31
then why is there only .3 BTC in there? seems a little strange.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:10:36
That's definitely that play here. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:25:17
I think most people around here understand the role SR plays as a driving force. If anyone ever logs in and checks it out they will finally "get it". 
Also, $150/BTC means all those dealers are fucking seriously rich right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:24:44
why would anyone trade there? it just looks like a awful place to put anything of value. That chat can be fun to read occasionally though
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:37:24
The coolest thing is probably the tipbot. imo. The cooler thing will be when there are tipbots for every major social media site.
Also, SR is a pretty interesting sociological experiment.
I'll be honest though, I only skimmed your post bro
@_date: 2013-03-15 04:10:08
This is what really excites me about Bitcoin. Think of all the things you do to show support instead of giving someone money, up votes, likes, re-tweets, subcribes, even advertising revenue. If Bitcoin tips could be known as an acceptable way for creators to keep doing what they do it could really take off in an other direction.
The reddit tip bot really is the base model of it. Imagine if it was easy to do on youtube, facebook, twitter, ect.
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:02:13
I'm really wondering why every new person feels the need to start mining? Why?? 
Start by not mining.
@_date: 2013-03-05 15:43:27
I think you should be comfortable going from 40 to 35 at least. 
Maybe you have someone you trust who can call you if it happens when your sleeping?
Also, you are assuming you can even sell during a flash crash, sell orders could pile up and you may have trouble getting through.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:16:24

You'd be gambling with that $500. You should just wait. If they are really worth this much work for them, don't pay.
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:19:20
The idea for the big players is to pump it up as far as they can. Then quickly try to fill every buy order down to a certain amount, say 34 is where they stop the flood. Keep in mind, they know what they are doing, it's part of the process, they only make money when they sell. and they will make money as long as people want to buy their stuff. 
Some of these people don't care about what you care about, any kind of ideology about how this Network will change things is irrelevant to them. They get in, and then they get out and they make cash faster than they can on wall street.

It's going to a quick overview of the network. I'm taking a different angle than the other vid. I'm not trying to get people to open an account, just trying to give them the whole picture including the many risks involved. which the that video never mentioned the entire speculative nature of BTC.

leave your computer on all month with your GPU on full blast will be a noticeable increase in your bill. And when you look at your BTC wallet you might see a dollars worth.
Unless you have many GPUs and a huge power supply BTC mining will not be profitable. You wont break even. Mining is not for newbs. This question comes up every day and I have no clue why every new person needs to mine.
That is what one needs to know.

I know we all like to think this will be corrected - and it will stop. 
However...The really potentially damaging thing that could happen is once this dies down, the big guys pick up an enormous stake in BTC. I could imagine the real traders buying up everything once it's at $15. That would be really bad. Too many coins would be controlled by to few people.
*edit- which could basically control the market.

1- It is a global currency by default. You are automatically connected to every city-level economy in the world. No middle men. 
2- At its current state you need to know more about technology than using cash. It can be easy to make mistakes as a newb. 
3- If you take the prescribed steps you will be fine. 
4- I want this currency to be an alternative, not a complete replacement. It will be good for certain things and not so good for others.

I'd say the smartest way is to work for them at this point. Small gigs like quick logo design, writing blog posts, image editing, and other things that can be done remotely.
I'm about to offer something similar to the network, which I hope to be one of the first in doing. 
I'd say mining is not smart way to go for a newb.
The easiest way is to pay for them in person with people to find at local bitcoin.

I come here every day. How the FUCK did I miss a thread where 13 Bitcoins were just given away?

Everyone is allowed to have many addresses for the same wallet. It's encouraged to use many addresses, I've even seen it said that you shouldn't use the same address twice.
So just use more addresses.

it's an interesting point. But value is all relative, suppose he was good miner back in the day and has a ton of coins? He's taking something that was essentially worthless and generating a lot of good from it.
Suppose the value is more than just the "profit" being made by us here tonight, it's actual real world people that may benefit from this.

My impression was that the big money arrived at $20 in late Feb, and has been moving in and out which has been causing the crashes. 
I assumed these people were the super elite types, not investors looking for long term increases in wealth, but sort term windfalls. Whether that's oil money from the middle east, ex-wall street barons, or sons of Russian oligarchs. 
Ever seen the documentary about Enron? there is a part in there where they play the recordings of the energy speculators fucking with the California energy market for huge amounts of money. They knew what they were doing, they didn't give a fuck, and they were having a ton of fun.
I have a feeling it's something like that. So that's why I don't tell people to run out and by bitcoins at the moment.

I have to assume it was the bots that were triggered to sell sell sell if there was an outage on the biggest exchange. They aren't rational people like you and me, they must follow "if then" statements.
If Gox goes down for X number of minutes then sell.

you need a time machine. 
You can't mine like that anymore. sorry.

You mean .38
you should be careful, bitcoin typos can be very expensive. I know, and that's why I'll never got to satoshi dice again.

Anytime there are buyers coming back they just get hammered again.
These guys are unloading.

The soon is now, and those dudes like to make quick money.
They are driving it up. then they will move everything out just as fast as they came in. If you hold a major position you should not be sleeping right now. 
Total market manipulation. Look to be buying once the dust settles, I know I will be. I want in at $20, and I'm going to get it I think.

While there was a big drop in the last hour, the price is still around $30 above where it was on April 1st. And about $100 dollars above where it was on March 1st.
