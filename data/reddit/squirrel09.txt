They shouldn't change just Bitcoin Cash, but also Gold and any other "Bitcoin" out there. Have a standard. If your a Bitcoin "Whatever" you're known as B"Whatever". Consistency.

What is funny about not paying taxes and being put in jail for years and having all your life taken from you?

From my research... if you own the wallet that it is going to it is not considered a sale, only a transfer. From what I read, Coinbase says that on their end they count every transfer as a sale (Playing it safe with the IRS), but it is up to the user to keep accurate records to determine what is a sale, and what is a transfer. Remember, at the end of the day Coinbase doesn't file your taxes, you do!

Bitcoin isn't a good way to achieve that goal. Mainly because the only growth is based on value of the coin. I'm going to stick to round numbers for this. Say you bought 1 bitcoin for $10,000. Woot! It's now 13k! But your expenses this month is 3k... So now you have $10k worth of bitcoin. But sense you sold you now own .79 bitcoin. But oh oh! Bitcoin went down to 9k... But your expenses are still 3k... Sell off some more. Now you have 6K worth of bitcoin but only .5 bitcoin.
Moral of the story is you'll only loose bitcoin overtime, and the amount needed to sustain yourself is dependent on the market price. If market price continues up at an average of 1k a month.... Well calculate what you need and buy that much. (You need 3k? We'll if Bitcoin goes up 1k in a month you'll need 3 bitcoin.) But this ISN'T a guarantee... at all... and chances are you will live in so much stress of the price of BTC that you'll go mad.
It sounds like you want to make passive income with as little work as possible... Look for stocks that give dividends. And if you can buy alot of bitcoin... you can buy alot of stocks. Use RobinHood (app) to buy said stocks.
If you don't care for passive income, but more so want to work for yourself. Find a hobby and try to monetize it. I love writing, so I freelance in my spare time. Like video games? Start a youtube channel. Like Sports? Start a blog. Can you build? Build people things on etsy...
But trying to live off bitcoin isn't going to happen if your asking the question. Because if you had the money to buy enough bitcoin to not worry anymore... you'd already have the money.

Check the block chain for your transaction Id the meme pool is flooded right now so if you set a low fee it could be stuck there

I don't really have extra money in my budget to buy bitcoin... So I started using MTurk to make money on the side for bitcoin... a month ago and now I have about $250 invested. I secretly hope bitcoin dips every week when I make my weekly $50 purchase. lol

YO. Christian here to shed some light.
First I believe stuff like this is fake or more so exaggerated. But the idea comes from scripture that talks about falling to ones face in the presence of God. I believe biblically that means that when someone sees an Angel (Think Mary and Joseph), Jesus (Lots of people bowed to him), or the Spirit (Old testament humbo jumbo) they are overwhelmed by the glory of it all and bow in reverence or  honor.
These people however take it that your body is "Slain in the Spirit" That is that in the presence of the Holy your body basically looses control of it all and the person becomes like they're dead... So we have instances like this where people are told (and they believe) that when the pastor talks... It's the most holy thing possible... and when we swings his hands at you you're supposed to fall. Not because the teacher has any power... But because you think that they are the most holy thing in the world, and you are not. So when they touch you (Or apparently throw invisible balls at you) your body just shuts down.
I hope that helps... if you're interested here is an rundown of basically what's hapening and why it's not from scripture. [here](

Well... I try not to be annoying about it. I also try to know my audience. Most likely no one on Reddit cares that I'm a Christian. But when the fact that I a Christan builds into the conversation, the extra perspective is usually geared kindly.

I have all types of investments. Roth IRA, Bonds, Stocks, and Bitcoins. Bitcoin has definitely earned me the most (Bonds the least). But It's good to know that if Bitcoin burst, I got something... If Stocks crash... I got something. If things go well all around I remain happy. If all goes to pot... I'll survive in the waste land.

I didn't know this was possible. Are there any risk with this (Other than the off chance the B2X skyrockets after fork?)

r/bitcoin does have like 10 btc for advertising purposes.... lol on our way there.

No I don't expect the same result. But there's nothing new here that hasn't been done before (at least at the time of the original post) We already had a 6K+ 24 hours... and here they were celebrating a 6k+ for like 20 hours.
Now we're hanging around 6.1k and haven't gone under in 24.5 hours so... yay! And as I said in my first post, these numbers don't really mean or do anything...

You know... I constantly check BTC price... so setting up these alerts is basically pointless.

But I figured that is what the fee is for? Or is their fee specifically for their transaction fee?

To all of those saying "Don't let you wife make financial decisions" or that my wife has full purchasing power... That is simply not the case. I've been making smaller purchases for the last couple of months, but wanted to go in big. We have chose to share our finances (But we have our own personal spending money.) $3,000 is quite a bit for us, so I'm not going to spend 3k with out her permission.

I love r/personalfinance. Frequent there, and if they taught me anything it's that it is important to diversify. I don't only invest in bitcoin, I don't only invest in stocks, I don't only invest in bonds, I don't only invest in legos. I invest in them all (But bitcoin has netted me the most even with my limited funds.)

Correct me if I'm wrong... But when it went over 6k earlier this month it held there for about a 24hrs. Then back down and hovered in the 5k range till yesterday afternoon when it broke 6k again. We still have like 2 hours before that 24 hour mark...
Not that these numbers mean anything... but so far, other than the ATH price being reached nothing is different that when we hit 6k earlier in the month. (And we reached ATH then too...)
