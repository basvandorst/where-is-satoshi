So it runs on tor... Can anyone ELI5 how anonymous it actually is to buy and sell on Bitsquare?
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:54:08
Whoa, you guys are here? That is supercool. I had no idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:45:18
Dude, do your own research. There is so much misinformation on both sides. And also valuable ideas and tech. Trust noone!!
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:33:40
Haha. So true!
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:37:30
Thanks all! Yes the qr code was in the emails. We recovered 200usd. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:56:03
Half is not enough. Order of magnitude is needed. If we dont do it fast enough, then other forks will win. Its a nobrainer. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:20:13
Wow, a quality post!
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:37:51

I second this.
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:40:08
Thanks for being on the front lines!!! And doing actually useful things!! 
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:06:37
I'm reading both subreddits and I must say r/btc is less toxic... Also it seems to me that r/bitcoin consists of mostly newer users. Probably because the old-timers have been banned a long time ago. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:09:03
Try them both. The difference is painfully obvious when you do. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:47:50
Good thing they have public mod logs so we can see all that...
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:43:10
Dude, if you ask in this sub, then you get the "bcash is evil" answer. If you ask in the bcash camp you get the other view. Do your own research, ask around, make up your own mind based on info from all sides. Its the only way. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:34:45
I think both sides are pretty tired of this fight...

You know, the bch crowd is thinking of putting the whole thepiratebay database on blockchain. Essentially making TPB obsolete. I guess time will tell who has the last laugh...

Can you elaborate on why you are not disclosing real numbers? I mean whats the benefit of hiding the numbers?

I also sent 5 EUR tip to barack obama. I know that chances of him accepting it is close to 0 but imagine if he did... I would be famous overnight :P
I would probably pay even 100 EUR or more for such privilege.

Guys, this is news about datafeed. It does not mean that everyone who uses bloomberg to watch charts can now buy it. They can just get real time charts on this instrument.

Sw+Ln will not make possible what early adopters dreamt and planned for bitcoin. Ln is a few years out. The fees will be an order of magnitude higher by then. Developing world will not be able to open channels for micropayments. Its really really sad actually. R/bitcoin has banned most old timers so in this infobubble here you dont even hear the old dream. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:49:35
500 bits. Spread the internet love, brother!!!!
@_date: 2015-05-13 11:17:27
Who are "they" and how do you think they hold the price down?
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:26:41
Maybe not in the long term, but we have lost many use cases by that ridiculous​ cap and fees. Yes i think its ridiculous at this stage. I would bump up against hardware and bandwith limits a thousand times more gladly. Its so not needed... And i am aware of the stupid fud in this sub. Its so loud because all the voices of reason have been banned over the last few years. Its depressing... Btc is bleeding market share to alts every freaking day by millions and millions and people in both bitcoin subs just keep fighting and fighting. At this point im starting to think that bitcoin deserves to go under. This will be looked back as the stupidest thing in crypto history...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:21:49
And what about the "other 6 billion?" Andreas was talking about it a lot, how bitcoin was goimg to enable financial services for the developing world. That dream is dead now. Bitcoin is not what it was a few years ago. Its not what i joined it for. You guys dream small. Its a shame....
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:43:04
Doesnt mean we should stop taking on new users for 4+ years and give altcoins a chance. How about we let the developing world also join the party and we use the payment channels when they are actually needed and ready. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:11:18
Actually we have 8+ lane road and we just block all but one lane. For no good reason. Your analogy is crap. And so is your attitude.
@_date: 2016-06-20 10:51:17
Well... We are about to test a huge amount of code with SWit right here on our precious bitcoin. What could go wrong??
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:33:31
There is no 12bln usd bounty on testnet... Huge difference.
@_date: 2016-06-07 07:55:45
pfff, c´mon Mike!!!
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:57:59
500+ lines of code is huge...
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:06:48
We cannot afford to transact in bitcoin. Red countries are the poor ones. Have you seen the transaction costs recently? Unusable in everyday small dealings :(
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:46:23
Cant believe this has been up for 5 hours...
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:29:54
This is bad. Very very bad.
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:28:01
Why don't they support cashaddr format yet???
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:11:24
Why is nobody mentioning the statements he wrote in the transaction data?
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:52:11
Im a regular user and i just downloaded XT client. Fork this s**t!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:21:30
But not if the post is about positive aspects of it, right?!
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:23:49
That would be the case if they called it bitcoin core. They didnt though, because they actually want to be different. They both do share most of the blockchain history so "bitcoin" in both names is pretty justified imo. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:34:44
Why is everything an attack in this sub? I mean jesus christ, just stop it. Enough already. If some people want to pursue their vision - let them. They have as much right to do it as anyone else. Nobody is attacking you. Stop this fud already, its not helping anyone. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:29:11

Yep :D
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:31:12
I really dont want to get into an argument here. Just wanted to point out that both sides look the same to me in their demonising of the other sub. I choose to not be part of this. If i have not been able to convince you then thats fine with me. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:52:54
I read both subs and this is super hilarious to me. Specially how applies to both subs equally!! 
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:31:50
I honestly had to think hard to find out if you support bu or core. Then i remembered what thread it was. Point is both points of views feel justified depending on which information field you put yourself in. May i propose an experiment? Read r/btc exclusively for a month. You will start seeing their point of view, im sure..
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:09:20

Tnx, but this does not explain:"boosted volume to get access to coins" claim.
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:44:03
Is this SSS split key thing some kind of extra feature of entropy or standard that everybody will be using by default?
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:10:24
This sub looks exactly the same when looking from their perspective. I prefer to not lable or assume malice. Both subs want bitcoin to succeed!
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:09:37
lol. They didnt get to where they are by being stupid :)
