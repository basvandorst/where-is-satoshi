Why would he? He has 13 billion dollars because of it and he's an inventor of cryptocurrency. But if he forgoed all that and said "Fuck Bitcoin" they still wouldn't listen to him.

I mean, I'm libertarian, and I don't want to impose any restrictions on anything, but I think crypto devs should make it their goal to be as transparent as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:06:42
I wouldn't say I think it's illegal, but it's definitely immoral and not fair. If people are trading something, there should be total transparency, just like there is with stocks and the stock market.

@_date: 2019-03-30 11:33:08
This does not mean anything though. Bitcoin price will be the same as right now, and it won't really matter. Since the overall supply won't reduce, it will just slow down the growth rate. 
And with the technology advancing and mining speeds increasing, it doesn't mean jack shit.

Isn't that a hypocritical statement? I'm calling the Democratic Party evil while you're calling the Republican Party "fascist" while lecturing me about how that's wrong. Also, OP donated to an American political party, and I see no reason why not to say my opinion about that. I'm not from an "eastern bloc" country, we're very much western and one merit that comes with that is I have the right to give my opinion.

I don't honestly think that the price is going to grow a lot more, I can wait decades. Same as the price of gold decreased over time, so will this.
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:30:44
I said someone inside the Democratic Party is a corrupt manipulator and that these candidates' voices are being supressed by their own party.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:32:39
Well maybe you're right, but there's gotta be someone higher up in the hierarchy that's manipulating something in the party, isn't there? After all, why does Yang's mic get cut like the previous commenter said?
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:08:00
He's not evil, maybe you've read it wrong or maybe I wrote it that way, but the Democratic Party is, from what I've gathered a corrupt and evil party. Not its candidates, but the party itself. Too many cover-up, mysterious deaths and scandals from them.
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:13:36
Dude you have no actual intent on actually having a debate, you're strawmanning me all the time instead of actually listening.
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:55:12
Bruh, that is what I said.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:00:57
First off, I am not even American and honestly I don't care much about who you elect as president. I do not support the Republican Party either, in fact I'd call myself a libertarian. I'm not saying this guy doesn't want the best for his country, but the way he wants to do it is quite stupid and makes no sense. Just like Zimbabwe tried to print more money and make everyone rich.
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:12:49
Yeah, politics brings out the worst in people a lot of times and it's not how things usually are.
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:19:03
I'm aware, and I never said I fully agree with them either. Trump's stance on crypto, drugs, and war in the Middle East, and a potential one in Iran is something I disagree with. I fully disagree with the Democrats though.
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:27:03
I've gotten a similar message, wasn't aware of it being a scam but definitely not going to message a random ass stranger from my phone. So I responded with a dm and it didn't ever reply, meaning it's almost certainly a bot.
@_date: 2019-08-04 14:46:13
Just because I said one party is evil doesn't mean I don't think the other one isn't without any faults either.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:39:46
I do know that. The Democratic Party is a party of evil, but his ideas are crap anyways, but this is the way he'll get most attention with.
Remember Bernie and Seth Rich? Same thing. The Dems are a disgusting party.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:17:12
Wow, donate Bitcoins to a person who stands for exactly the opposite of what crypto does.

Universal basic income is a form of socialism/communism which basically are increased government control, just like in China, North Korea and Venezuela and cryptocurrency means people have control of their own property. These two things aren't really compatible, and yea I've checked his site, and even though he says he is not a communist, his system is garbage because rich people do not pay taxes (and why should they?) as there are so much loopholes to abuse and this will collapse on the common people with insane tax rates.
Thank God he has no chance of winning, although I don't want to jinx myself.
Whoever donates or supports people like this has absolutely no clue how economy works.
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:12:44
Yes, I'm saying the Democratic Party is corrupt, never said the other party isn't too and I also said the OP's donation is stupid because that's not what crypto is for.
@_date: 2016-12-14 12:18:45
Really helpful advice, I'd rate it 9/11
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:47:37
Yep, agreed! I'm from Croatia where I guess politics are a bit more chill than over there (doesn't mean there's no corruption and we're doing great, sadly).
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:00:58
Ah, I remember this and it's opposite counterpart from when it was hovering on about 1000 dollars.

At 20% of the price and 150% of performance, it sounds about right.

That's quite less compared to 30m in tax. BTW, 30% tax, what communist shithole is this country we're talking about?

Jamie Dimon is a corrupt communist dickhead, as he obviously can't see past the oppression of taxes. His company is falling apart, and instead of implementing cryptos to save it, he's rejecting it. Very well then, we'll see you when you're begging on your knees in a year or two.

Stealing our jobs.

Instead of making them pay cheaper for paying with Bitcoin, why not make them pay more for not using Bitcoin, since there are fees to convert it into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:24:10

B-BUT DEFLATIONARY CURRENCY DOESN'T WORK!!! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:16:07
It was socialism, corruption and the authoritarian regime that ruined your country. So, the first step for your coumtry would be to get rid of their currency, and replace it with something decentralized, which can be any cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin with it's astronomical fees. 
Second, your country has a lot of oil and potential for tourism which are great economy boosters. If the citizens of Venezuela perform a coup and replace the commies with a capitalist, libertarian government, you can start working on rebuilding tourism and oil companies. Unemployment would fall and more and more jobs would be created. 
Then the employers could pay workers in cryptocurrency, closing the entire circle. 
I do understand your anger, but introducing cryptocurrencies into Venezuela and replacing the bolivar with let's say, Ether (which has low fees and fast confirmations) would be the first step in saving Veneuela. A few years will be needed, but it's totally possible. 
Cryptocurrencies WILL save the entire world and I'd bet you a thousand Bitcoins that by 2027, Bitcoin will be priced 200,000 dollars, Venezuela will become one of the richer countries in the world, and North Korea will overthrow the Kim regime. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:47:04
Hodling isn't saving. It's long term investing. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:55:56
That's what I meant, but I made it shorter so it doesn't turn into a long comment. But I believe that as the economy grows, that the crime rate falls.
Also, with cryptocurrency it's assumed there aren't taxes, so yeah...
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:09:40
The thing is, you won't send the wrong amount if you just scan the code. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:37:38
Venezuela? So sorry for what your government did, but don't worry, Bitcoin will save you all. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:12:30
So, what is this supposed to mean in relation to my statement?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:28:45
Isn't all investing risky? But yet, people got rich from it. Look at Warren Buffet.

It wasn't me who downvoted. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:59:32
Well, that's why we can make satoshi our base unit of value, not 1 Bitcoin.
So a cup of coffee costs 7000 satoshi, not 0.00007 BTC or whatever. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:24:02
That's not how capitalism works though. 
And no, if that happened, we would stagnate, no new advancements would be made, and we'd be miserable.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:44:03
How is Bitcoin ending capitalism? I really am having a hard time keeping track or understanding your logic.
One simple conclusion I've reached the more and more I study economy is that Bitcoin won't replace money, ever.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:36:01
Forgot to add the /s. For fuck's sake.
Anyways, you meant the right form of mass hunger, poverty and overall depression? 
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:36:29
If people spent only on things they needed, nobody would buy anything and the market would collapse. 
Also, growth and recession are two permanently alternating states, and neither can last forever.
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:17:54
Deflation makes no sense, inflation encourages spending. 0-2 percent inflation would be optimal for a good economy, but negative inflation would discourage spending.
@_date: 2019-09-28 12:38:43
I'm talking about the new one though.
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:59:43
The Supra isn't really a good car, it's only hyped up. It's comparable to a Porsche Cayman and it's only popular because of Fast and Furious and the tuning capabilities, but the new one is hideous imo. It's also not really an expensive car either.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:29:52
That's not the point, what I'm trying to say is that negative inflation would lead to economic collapse.
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:39:34
Because of rounding.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:14:59
Well, like I said in respinse to the other guy, we have to move Bitcoin as a base unit to Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:16:36

@_date: 2017-05-08 23:04:28
Ok, I see your point, it does make sense. Did you like ban this post because of racist epithets? I've been doing a bit research on them and it seems that someone hacked them in 2015,and since then they don't work. They should've just closed it down as it's a scammy site to make you deposit, but only when you get to withdraw, it doesn't work. I'm pissed, 20 dollars down the drain, but fuck it, it only took me a week of spare time to earn it. I'll earn more as I'm buying a mining rig and there will be much more cash. As for Bter.com, can I talk to the Chinese police or something to help prevent people from doing the same mistake I did?
