Fractional reserve banking is not bullshit. Banks lend out many times (9+) what they have on deposit, that creates money. If they run short due to a bank run or malinvestment they can go to the central bank and get a super cheap loan. The Central Bank also created money to provide the loan.

Ahhh, I love the smell of Reddit during election season. It's all "This guy sucks because of a, b and c. And the replies are all "WTF are you talking about?" -- Never gets old.

For those of you that have not had the pleasure of your money being confiscated from a bank let me tell you how it goes (in the U.S):
1. A government entity (usually the IRS) sends your bank a letter claiming that you owe them x amount. Note: this is just a letter, not a court order. The person sending the letter is just some dude/gal behind a desk at the IRS. This is called "administrative" law --an unconstitutional farce if you ask me. 
2. The bank automatically pulls your money (if there is any) from your account and usually charges you a $100 fee for the privilege.  They will do this once per letter. If the IRS wants to do it again, they have to send another letter. 
3. Your bank only notifies you after your account has been raided. 
4. They don't leave you anything if there is less in your account than they say you owe. 
5. The bank will hold on to your money for a period of time (30 days?) before sending it to the IRS, ostensibly  to allow you to potentially come to terms with the IRS. 
Some take aways:
1. There is no due process.
2. FRNs are not considered "property."
3. Banks are in cahoots with the Feds.
4. Calling the bank to get a resolution, etc. is futile, they will not budge. 
5. About all you can do is request a copy of the letter, which they will send, but it's of little value. All it will say is that you owe x amount and it'll be signed by a pseudonym. 
Source: I've had thousands of my dollars stolen from the Feds repeatedly in this fashion. Sure makes paying rent and Xmas challenging.
