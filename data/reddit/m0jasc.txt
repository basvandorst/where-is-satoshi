When the how much you trust them question came up, should have been like "At least bitstamp doesn't have people flying off the top of their building."

Confused. Are you saying that we need a "government" to bail out Gox everytime it fails, guaranteeing that this will happen again and again? or..

Sorry, been up for 72+ hrs straight so I prob read 10% of that correctly.

Goldman ain't got time for bitcoins. They got that $700 Trillion dollar derivatives market to manipulate.

For those that are still confused, China is essentially cutting of bitcoins' legs before it can even learn to walk. So bitcoin is still just another investment medium to china, basically throwing the essence and core purpose behind bitcoin out the window.
..from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong

If you take USD and buy a potato, then give that potato to someone else with the intentions of using the potato as the medium of exchange for illicit activity, isn't that still money laundering? It doesn't matter if you use a car wash or through non "Monetary Instruments" such as bitcoins, the crime is the same..right? Meh what do I know.

Coinbase is prob best for US residents to purchase BTC initially
You trade on an exchange. So send your purchased coins to either the Btce.com, bitstamp.net, or bitfinex.com.
If your going to be trading, expect your $300 already gone. If you just buy bitcoins and hold it on coinbase for a month or two, then your profits in the positives are more likely.
Idk about pools since I only trade but don't mine bitcoins, unless you have a server farm in your garage.
I think there is a beginersbitcoins reddit..look at the first "READ ME" post.

Thats ghetto. Haha. Glad you guys are taking the time to spread the word!

Ahh, the Dollor. From all this beating that it has gotten from all the QE's and generally through the deteriorating global economy, how has the USD managed to stay its "cool" (Can't even say value at this point)? The more I think about it, the more it becomes evident. The American people are completely blind and oblivious to anything happening outside, and therefore are spending and creating this facade that looks as a healthy economy. It makes me mad every time I go to USAToday and see that Justin Timberlake's concert has been canceled because he got sick. Wow I'm so glad that I knew JT couldn't make it, atleast now I can sleep in peace. No need to mention the Bloodshed happening in Ukraine as people are risking their lives for this civil protest. 
The best part is that the government has effectively bubbled the country within itself. Did anyone remember in Obama's state of union stating that he wanted to increase minimum wage to 10.10 because of the pregnant woman in who knows where, or the struggling minority family living in who knows there. And that this country is becoming stronger and we need the company's help by also raising wages to better everyone. What bullshit. There is NOT ONE example or proof that the global economy is improving, yet there is HUNDREDS of reasons why we're headed for a shithole. So how does the Feds combat that, oh lets just raise wages and say we are headed strong out of this recession, and by doing so Americans will continue to be oblivious to the inflation rates we're gonna see as the USD continues to get pounded. 
 
I, an American, rest my case.

Come on they don't give two shits about the global economy or trading away household bank accounts, you think they will care about a youtube video or a few protesting? You can't go around "suing" every obstacle that comes in the way of bitcoins. Your more likely to get the Chinese gov to make BTC the state currency then to get around these banks, with JPM at the top of the list.

In the end, investors would be lining up (if not already) to buy Mt.Gox with a bailout. You and I would never know it, but to own Mt.Gox is to own Bitcoins. Now is Mt.Gox as influential as a few months ago or a year ago? Probably not, but nonetheless, its still influential and will be till it completely decouples from bitcoins. Hell, I bet the Houbi Pump&amp;Dump team have approached to them to buy over gox. 
Analogy for the naysayers: Mark is Ben Bernanke. Everytime Karpeles/Bernanke opened their mouth, the respected currency takes a dip with the claims of "insider trading" back in the hot seat. However,Brotha Ben always had an impact on the world economy and every currency traded with the USD.
Ben stepped down; Mark stepped down. But just as the Federal Reserve will continue to influence the global economy, Mt. Gox will continue to influence Bitcoins.
(Don't take the analogy too seriously, its a comical representation at the similarities between them and current situation)

All of the will have similar verification process. Localbitcoins was a good option but didn't they get hacked or something? Meh don't know the details but its enough the keep me away.
Bitfinex/Stamp wire transfer would be my second choice after coinbase, just much bs US exchanges have to go through w/ regulation.

Woah throwback. Just remembered my Micky dollars I had when I was a kid from that pic. Daum nostalgic moment right there.

Its not a market anymore, its computer scripts going at each other, so TA is very unreliable and if it does happen to hit your lvl, its because the bots were programed too.
Wait till we have a significant move to get the market back involved, and don't base predictions as of long term/dead market data. At the very least find something with real market price-action to support. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:52:06
Yeah, no doubt. But if Bitcoins is really here to stay and become this worldwide form of currency, then investors will take the hit of whatever losses gox has (if thats the case), and think towards the future. We don't  know the current state of Gox, but we do know that Gox is still linked to almost every media coverage, and that bitcoins is still in its infant stage. This essentially makes us (those part of the current 8 Billion market Cap) irrelevant compared to the hundreds of billions of new investors that are expect to get sucked in 5, 10 years down the line.
