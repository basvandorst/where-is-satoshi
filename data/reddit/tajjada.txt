There are lightweight clients out there that implement something known as "blockchain pruning", such as Electrum. Those do not need to download the whole blockchain like bitcoin-qt does. Electrum will sync up and be ready to use within a couple of minutes. It also has quite good security.
I think only miners currently need to store the full blockchain (someone correct me if i am wrong), and that will have to change in the future so that we can keep mining distributed as bitcoin grows. When miners do not need the whole blockchain either, the block size limit will be safe to increase without worrying about the blockchain growing too huge.
The way I visualize the future of bitcoin is a much, much bigger block size limit, many transactions, and neither miners nor clients need to store the whole thing. The whole thing is still stored by large datacenters for backup and reference purposes.

I'm not arguing that bitcoin is bad for illegal stuff. I am arguing that bitcoin has many advantages which are universally applicable, and the potential they have for legal trade outweighs the negative side of them being used for illegal things.
The Internet has many great legal uses, but it also makes it easier to sell child pornography. Should we try to stop/abolish the Internet because of that? Don't think so. The same applies to Bitcoin.

I have used both Multibit and Electrum as lightweight (no need to download the whole blockchain) wallets. I would personally recommend Electrum over Multibit. Electrum seems to have more features and gives you more control over how you want your transactions done, while Multibit seems a bit feature-limited in that respect. Electrum also seems more secure.

I don't think you understood what I meant. I do not want bitcoin to be centralized. I never said that bitcoin will be controlled by those datacenters, I said they will just exist for backup purposes if anyone wants to review the history of bitcoin.
Instead, I proposed that bitcoin (both clients and miners) should evolve to not require anyone to store the full blockchain and still be able to operate in a decentralized/distributed manner like it does now, but without everyone needing to store tons of data.
The large datacenters I proposed exist solely for backup/reference -- they should have no role in the operation of the network. Even if they get taken down, it should not affect bitcoin, as neither clients nor miners will require the full blockchain by then.

I know I should stay away from gox. I don't like or want to use gox, but I had fiat stuck with them, and to my knowledge it's easier to get bitcoins out of there than fiat. So I exchanged.

That was what I was just about to say. I live in Africa. I have all the disk space I want (8TB on my desktop). Internet, however, tends to be a bit more of a problem here. I remember having to wait a couple of days for the blockchain to download back when I first got into Bitcoin in around January. And I have a faster connection than most people around here.
If we want bitcoin to be universal and used worldwide, we shouldn't restrict it to people who can afford fast internet.

With bitcoins, you don't take the role of the bank and print out your own money into papers. A paper wallet is a paper that gives you the key to accessing your bitcoins -- the bitcoins are still virtual.
Bitcoins can be considered to be "backed by" cryptographic proof of work. They are secure and valuable, because in order to cheat the system, you need to have insane amounts of processing power and take huge costs to (re)do proof of work. The distributed system of miners ensures than no one person or entity can take over the whole system. The more miners there are, the more secure the system is. The current mining difficulty can be considered a measure of how secure the system is.
And with government-issued fiat currencies, the value even of a paper banknote can be described as coming "out of thin air" -- the banknote has much greater value than its physical value as paper and ink.

This is exactly what I want to get people to understand. Bitcoin is not a money making machine, it's a currency with a lot of potential. Use it!
Thank you for your post, you deserve all my upvotes.

Or some even more advanced Tor users would prefer to have a local unix/linux Tor installation as a system daemon, ie run Tor without any sort of bundle etc. and configure everything else manually as needed for applications or relay/node.

I'm just sharing a story. Had an exciting opportunity, and wanted to share the experience with Reddit. You are free to think what you want. My post has nothing to do with anything related that has been posted here before. I think it will be nice of you to link me to the question you are talking about, as I didn't read that post, and now you provoked my curiosity :D
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:22:34
And another thing, let me add that new technologies with a lot of potential historically tend to first be discovered and put to use for illegal things before they find their place in legal applications. The Internet started being used for sharing illegal information long before it was adopted by the masses for legal stuff. Bitcoin, similarly, was much more quickly discovered by illegal services like SilkRoad, and that leads to the large number of illegal applications in its early days. That, however (again, just like the Internet!), does not mean that Bitcoin is better for illegal stuff than it is for legal stuff.

Exactly, internet speed is a far greater problem worldwide than disk space. I have 8TB on my desktop, but I also happen to live in Africa with a slow internet connection that peaks at 2mbps. I remember having to wait over a week for the blockchain to download back when I first got into bitcoin in January. And the blockchain wasnt even that big back then. A friend of mine who just heard about bitcoin a few weeks ago never actually managed to download the whole blockchain at all, so I recommended him to try Multibit.
If we want Bitcoin to become a world currency, it needs to be accessible to folks with slow internets. Not everyone has your stable 150mbps fiber connection.

Yes, value is a subjective and personal thing. Everyone can value different things differently. When something is valued by many people, it becomes a commodity and can be used as a medium of exchange between people. If it also has these properties:  using it as a medium of exchange becomes much easier and it can be considered a currency. A currency is simply a commodity that is convenient to exchange and valued/accepted by many parties. The USD and Bitcoin are currency because they fit that description. Your e-mail is not, because a random stranger from Dumbfuckistan most likely doesn't care about it. It is a great example of how something that is not a widely accepted commodity can have value, though! So thanks for pointing it out!

September 2012. I was trying to find a good stressful workload for my GPU. I was messing around with various BOINC (and other sciprojects, when I found one called Donate which mined bitcoins on your card and sent them to the scientists at GPUGRID. I quickly looked up bitcoin and found that it had something to do with internet payments / virtual currency, etc, so I automatically assumed it was some new experimental payment system trying to mimic things like PayPal.
I disregarded it and forgot about it completely, until my DAD (yes, quite ironically) told me about it in March 2013. I had no interest in it when he told me, but I like it when I know more than my dad on some topic, so I got determined to read more about it and do some research.
After I read about mining, I realized that it was THE perfect stress test for my GPU and I hit myself in the head for being a retard and disregarding it earlier in 2012 when I could have mined so much more, as the difficulty in March was already "quite high" (4mil haha :D). At that point, I quickly became obsessed with bitcoin.
I mined about 5 BTC on my GPU until the ASICs started coming out. Spent some of those on video games back when the price was around ~100$ per BTC. Ordered ASICs from BFL (oh god why... worst decision ever), which I got last week. So, here I am now....

Well, to be honest, I agree with you, because you somewhat misunderstood me. What I meant was not that I deny the potential for profit from BTCs. I meant that profit is not my focus for owning BTCs. I own them for a different reason, to trade and use as currency. If I profit from them in the meantime, only better for me. I don't deny it, but it is not my focus either.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:22:25

Nop, I actually did pay the fee. Looks like the transaction hasn't even been broadcast, not delayed by miners.

I suggest that you go and read up on all the practical advantages bitcoin, both as a currency and as a transaction system, has.
Also, I completely disagree with you on a lot of what you said. Of course money isn't new. That doesn't mean it cannot evolve. Paypal was a step in the evolution of money, and so is Bitcoin. Is Paypal wrong?
And as for the Internet, it wasn't much more unique than bitcoin is. The internet was a new form of telecommunications, another step in its evolution. Telecommunications weren't new back then either.
Both the Internet and Bitcoin are steps in the evolution of existing concepts that aim to move those concepts into a purely digital universe.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:26:09
I would say it's better to have lower, but stable values, rather than something that constantly fluctuates. It doesn't matter how high or low the value is, as long as it's stable. Bitcoin was meant as a currency -- to be exchanged for goods and services, not for hoarding. And, quite frankly, a stable value is what we need in order for that to happen.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:19:01
Yes, and that is exactly the reason why the blocksize cap should be increased rather than eliminated completely allowing for infinitely sized blocks. It is currently too small and will bottleneck the network as bitcoin gains more adoption, making transactions unrealistically expensive. Increasing the cap allows for more transactions with small fees, benefitting everyone (miners will get more fees due to the large number of transactions they include -- it costs them nothing as more transactions don't affect the mining of a block). Eliminating it completely would be bad for the exact reason you are saying.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:07:42
This is a real danger. Those manufacturers already produce many millions of chips for consumers worldwide. If they start producing mining chips as well, there is a possibility that whoever does it first manages to produce enough of them to pull off a 51% attack. What happens if they don't release the chips but use them themselves in secret?
Similarly, it was a real danger when the first ASIC mining companies appeared. Avalon could have easily done a 51% attack with a few batches of their initial testing chips back then. No one had ASICs, difficulty was low. But fortunately for us, Good Guy Avalon decided to sell mining devices and distribute the hashing power amongst people, securing the bitcoin network, instead of attacking it.
tl;dr: These major CPU/GPU manufacturers probably have enough resources to produce a fuckton of ASICs. What you suggest could be a real danger in the face of greed.

After re-reading my OP now I see that the last part of it isn't as clear as it could have been. What you said was more or less what I was about to say in response, and I mentioned things like that several times. What my last paragraph in the OP says isn't that there was an argument thrown at me that I didn't know how to respond to (I know very well why physical tangibility here is not a valid argument) -- I was prepared to explain why that is not the case, but the discussion got interrupted by the teacher and I couldn't finish my point.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:59:06


Neither. When I said that people were interested I meant that people kept asking me questions after the discussion was over. I did not get a chance to reply, as the teacher thought that Bitcoin is off-topic and interrupted our discussion to proceed with class. A guy asked me how to buy bitcoins, but I couldn't explain to him in the middle of class so I told him that I can show him another time. That's the closest that happened to someone "asking how to get started".
Personally, I am satisfied by this opportunity, because I managed to clarify and correct a lot of misconceptions that people had about Bitcoin. That was my goal, and I think I accomplished it quite well. My goal wasn't to get more people into Bitcoin.

I am proud to say that I do not. I strongly believe in Bitcoin and its potential to change the world. The reason why I own Bitcoins is to exchange them for goods and services and use them as the free, open currency they are meant to be, not to treat them as a speculative investment and expect PROFIT!! from them.
And as far as I am concerned, I am not the only one.

So, you trust and feel safe in a proprietary Microsoft Windows OS?
I strongly recommend that you consider some sort of open-source/linux install when security is important.
Don't be scared of Linux. Distributions such as Fedora, Ubuntu, and many others provide user-friendly straightforward live cds which are great if you don't have experience with Linux.
