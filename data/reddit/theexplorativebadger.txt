I agree, but then again none of us knows what it's going to do. Its a tough decision between holding everything and not flinching, or do you expect another heavy crash cycle and try to dabble in long term trading at the top / bottom? Decent risk this tome sround of going to an ATH and never looking back.

John McAfee would beg to differ!

At the current rate vs blue, fair market value would be more like 2.5-3x of the most recent blue zone, and god knows from the previous xD. Double would be a steal

A nice gesture from you, kind Redditor. HODL and keep the spirits high!

This makes the decision clear... hodl no matter what

I bought my first pieces of bitcoin on July 26, 2018 @ 7948 USD. Thank you reddit! :)

If you know it will be a 100% loss, why would you put a single cent in? Don't go in to gamble, go in because you believe in the way it's headed and have a solid rationale for going in.

My comment may be naive, but if another support level breaks, and the cost of mining goes even more into the red for the average miner, how do you suppose there will be a sudden bounceback? I think it might be rather critical in the short term to maintain the $4k ish mark. 
On the contrary, the reduction in cost might appeal to other unsure investors where $4k is too much, but $3k is a 'deal'. It's more or less a popularity game at this point, and in my opinion, losing another support level surely reduces popularity amongst those already in, and is rstger intimidating for those thinking of getting in. If it goes to $3k, i think this stale growth gets dragged out for a good chunk of time.

This hits a little too close to home...

Agreed. I saw the "multiple cryptocurrencies" and lost interest in the rest of the article.

What's the play to actually get you to give him the money? He transfers it into your account, you go to the bank, and worst case, tell one of the tellers a man is following you. You walk with 20k, move to a new city. It really isn't your fault if somebody transfers money to your account. (Not legal advise by any means.. ignorance can be bliss)
Edit: By 'you walk', I don't mean you go withdraw it and literally walk away. But get away from him after the transfer and just never respond again.

The likelihood of owning Bitcoin is probably higher than the likelihood of owning an Aventador. So if you see an Aventador poster, it would be presumed to be decoration or hobby, very few would seriously consider it OP's actual car. But if you see crypto art in OP's apartment, it most certainly would not be assumed to be ignorant decoration.

To offer a single point of anecdotal data, I purchased exactly 1 Bitcoin because I felt compelled to have a round number that I can just watch the price and know what the total worth is.

I don't know that I would look at the comparison between number of millionaires and number of Bitcoin period. Take a look at the world economy of ~$77 Trillion, ask yourself what percentage of the economy you think gets taken up as Bitcoin 20 years in the future, and do some naive supply / demand to estimate your end price. That would be my best method to approximate future value
