It's first asking what kind of wallet I want to create: standard, 2-factor, multi-signature, etc. Does this have to be the same as the original? because I don't remember what I had chosen but it sounds like I had picked 2-factor since that's my initial dilemma

Hi guys, happy 12k!
Quick question, I'm trying to move my money out of my Electrum wallet and to a hardware wallet. To do so electrum is asking for my google authenticator code, which I don't have. It says I can reset the wallet by using the 12 word verification, which I do have. How do I go about doing this while making sure I don't lose my bitcoins? Thanks!

Do you have to specifically request for Crypto? My Robinhood account has already been approved, but there's nothing on the app about crypto trading

Guys, stop with the moon travel comments. Bitcoin already went to the moon in December. It’s time we go to Mars. ;)

What just happened? It's like this every midnight Eastern TZ, either a sharp spike up or sharp spike down. Which country/countries are waking up?

I installed electrum on my Mac and completed the set up and got all the way to the buy/sell page, then I closed the app. I tried going back to find it and I can’t find it anywhere on my mac.

Any chance that the prices are going because people are cashing out to pay for holiday expenses?

Yea I've been using Coinbase for Bitcoin and Litecoin. Bittrex is not allowing any new accounts right now.

I’m trying to prepare for the fork by moving my coins from Coinbase to a wallet (through gdax) but what’s the best wallet to avoid fees when I withdraw from the wallet? I’ve used Exedus but those fees were high. Should I go with electrum or mycelium or anything other suggestions?

Easy brother, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy diversification. Not everything not called Bitcoin is 'shit'.
I do think that BCH is shit though ;)

How do I transfer my bitcoins from Coinbase to Exodus, without fee? Or are there better wallets that anyone can suggest?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:24:03
Right, but that only works if there is a barcode to scan. There is no barcode

Guys, I've invested heavily (aprox 1 month's pre-tax income) into BTC and I'm still up aprox 25% after these crashes. I know you guys are saying HODL but these attacks are making me extremely nervous. Should I sell and take the profits or seriously HODL?

Hey guys, I'm trying to buy into Ripple and I tried opening a GateHub account and I thought it was successful (it said activation successful) but now I'm trying to log in and it keeps saying "Generate PGP Keypair error. Please try again.". Anyone have any ideas?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:32:42
Any wallet suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:39:07
I've been trying to buy since it was 0.76 cents but I'm still not verified on Bitstamp nor GateHub and it's been weeks. What a joke

I'm trying to log into Binance for the first time and it's asking for a google 2f authenticator but there's no barcode to scan. Anyone know what's up with Binance lately?

Noooo, a good time to buy is when it levels out and it's no where near that yet. I'm glad I sold at 18K and will buy back when it levels out.

Question regarding generating csv report on Coinbase/CoinbasePro. When I get an email from them to 'download report', I keep getting a hyperlink that has a bunch of gibberish on it regarding the transactions made. How to actually download it though? i.e. into a 8949 generator or excel?
Thanks in advance
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:38:18
I don't know what that is

So I missed the day we had CPAs answering questions. I'm trying to figure out how to handle my Bitcoins and other cryprocurrencies. Am I supposed to use a 1099 or 8949? I used Bitcoin.tax and uploaded my coinbase and gdax transactions from 2017 and it generated an 8949 form, not a 1099.

Good time to buy or is there another dip coming?

Trying to stray away from Coinbase/pro. I have my bitcoin in a wallet, but I want to be prepared on another exchange in the coming months for moon. What's recommended?
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:12:53
I’m curious, is bitcoin always measured against USD internationally? Or Euro too?
I bring this up because resistance walls always appear to be against rounded USD values.

We hovered around $5,000 for the entire month of April. Take it easy!
