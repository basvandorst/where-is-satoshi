I don't know you, and I don't spend much time in reddit, but this statement of yours is a massive contradiction to your previous posts in this thread. It's mind numbing.

They would only be non-standard so long as NOP2 is consistently rejected by v3 nodes, not because of anything explained in that BIP.
I'm assuming this is not the case because then it would be a hard fork and v3 nodes would ignore the chain with v4 blocks as soon as they contained transactions like that.

Please move, but don't expect everybody else to agree with you.

Honestly guys you need to start giving warning or bans to crybabies. Every post is a post whining on moderation by the usual suspects and making snide remarks at moderation choices.
Please do that, and make rules clearer because the guidelines don't mention many things that you guys have said over the last few months.

The ecosystem has decided. Check the miserable amount of BIP101 blocks mined in the last month.

Probably the biggest single business, but I believe the Chinese speculators move more Bitcoin than Coinbase, making them bigger economically.
If Coinbase chose to break up and split Bitcoin, I'm convinced they'd find themselves in the smaller half with XT. I think they know this.

Looks like a massive bubble to me, to be frank.
I don't doubt they are a big business but that valuation seems a bit insane for their underlying business.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:18:44
If Coinbase pushes for a contentious hard-fork, which is the scenario Theymos mentioned, then in my opinion they should be banned. I agree with him.
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:26:16
The question was if you had supported it before in this forum. We disagree on your judgement on Core and XT developers (whom I rate from their work) but that's a different topic and I'm not interested in debating it.
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:18:50
Personally I don't think this should be a celebrity contest. Some devs including Satoshi are completely anonymous, as they should be. Some important players are as well, and a big number of smaller players. Coinbase can die in a fire as far as I'm concerned, together with Circle and the VC co-opts.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:07:19
What is the question? You made a speech, not a question.
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:59:11
Thanks Theymos, I appreciate.
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:15:53
Didn't you support XT and Gavin's data center vision?
Honest question, maybe I'm confusing your user name with numbers and all.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:18:12
Let them be martyrs there. Nobody cares.
Also don't forget about making the rules clearer. Really this cannot carry on like this, you cannot even refer them to rules because they are basically nowhere to be found.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:54:23


That doesn't sound very respectful to me.
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:28:23
It would be, but you are making that up. The amount of raw transactions in the main blockchain is only one part of the whole system. I disagree with the notion that no other improvements are going to happen in the next 20 years that BIP101 hard-codes in their plan.
@_date: 2015-11-13 00:06:53
I thought you hated it here, or maybe I'm confusing you with a different user?
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:07:50
When you do the dirty deed for the State, it's an all or nothing deal. There is no half-infiltrating Bitcoin for the State. Speech and transactions are either free for everything, above all for what the State doesn't want them to be free, or they are not free at all.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:07:43
So the answer was "no", it wasn't you who was supporting XT here.
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:25:44
Thanks for that information but that wasn't the question.
Were you supporting XT in here yes or no?
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:22:22
The limitations are not set by our wishes. We improve the system as much as we can, and admit whatever limitations exist.
For me, Bitcoin is pointless if only a minority of people can afford to maintain a node.
I probably have a different vision of Bitcoin as you do. Saving a little money in putting a chewing gum sale in the chain is not a priority for me.
@_date: 2015-11-13 22:42:07
Personally I'm a BYOB type. Wouldn't use this.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:01:02
Complaints are loud, while agreement is silent.
I'm also happy with Theymos and his choices, if anything I wish he enforced the rule more consistently instead of pointlessly trying to appease enemies like he's doing lately.

Exposure to spam attacks and selfish mining attacks.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:10:33
I'm not even a reddit regular, what forces you to come here? I prefer ycombinator myself.

The number of transactions are not divided among people as you make up. We know the amount of transactions that currently fit, the requirements of transaction per day or year is what you made up.
Plus, you insist in that all transactions must be on-chain.
If requirements grow above capacity they will have to find way elsewhere or off-chain somehow. You just cannot artificially match requirements with capacity that isn't there.
The requirements can be pumped almost without limit. There's the IoT too, one can virtually generate demand at will. At some point the market and capacity will have to settle how many of these can be persisted forever in the main blockchain.
Nodes are averaging around 300KB save for spam attacks. Fees are extremely low and mining depends on the subsidy strongly, with gaps appearing after the halving. People are giving up on running nodes, which is a tangible loss unlike the fabricated capacity crisis.
No, I don't see the needs you are seeing, and if you arbitrarily require the system to persist forever in the blockchain a trillion transactions per second, or just 100 as things stand, and you have destroyed what we have that works for a pipe dream we know it won't under this model.
This is why the XT people should do as they say they would and fork with checkpoints if they insist in following that path, because the miners have already spoken. Change the proof of work, make transactions incompatible, and follow your dreams. Mike said they would, I wonder if why did he change his mind or was it a bluff?
