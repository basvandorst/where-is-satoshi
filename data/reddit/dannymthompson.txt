You might wanna retry it, they've seriously upped their game and chrome is slow af for me recently.

Ahh that's a shame, for my personal use I've found it to be faster for bulk uploads in my work so I've gravitated towards using it for everything.

I can't tell if ironic
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:22:16
Again, can't tell if joking.

Thank you, there have been times where chrome has slowed my powerful laptop and I've been clueless as to why. This could be the answer.

It depends where you are in the world

It's definitely true, I think OP sees this as an attack on Crypto but tbh it's simply stating a fact.

Lmao that would be insane

If you look the signs have been shopped so... it is actually a meme.

I think you mean about tree fiddy

Because people think that screenshotting and cropping an image instead of just saving it is a logical way to post something.

Your only colour option for this is $2500?
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:23:15
How large is the image in pixels for it to be that size?
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:34:56
