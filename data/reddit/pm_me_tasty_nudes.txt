What are the benefits of using eToro as opposed to Gemini.com as someone suggested?

Alright, I’m off to spend my money!
Thank you so much for the help, man. I really appreciate it. And I didn’t notice anything wrong with your English at all, man, don’t worry. I’m not a native English speaker myself!

Any experience is worth tons, man. Doesn’t matter how old you are honestly, it seems like you know a lot more than I do, and you’ve been super helpful. I’ll definitely take you out for a ride in my Lambo, hahah! Good luck to you as well!

Thank you! You’re absolutely right that I’m only looking to buy the most “known” coins, at least for now, and a nice and easy UI sounds very good. I read in a review that someone started getting phone calls from salesmen and shit after signing up to eToro, do you have any experience with something like that? To me it seems a little hard to believe that a pretty widely used service like that would be connected to spamming customers or handing out their phone numbers?

Thanks for the tip!

Seems like they aren’t operational in my country as of right now, unfortunately :/

Yeah, I was thinking something along those lines as well. The timing of the phone calls were probably a coincidence, I just noticed a lot of mixed reviews about the site. Some claiming it’s a scam, and others saying it’s great, but I guess that’s how it will be with any service of this kind. I’m sure a lot of those bad reviews come from new hobby investors angry about making a bad investment anyways.
Thank you for the tip though, I’ll definitely check it out!

Sorry if I’m bothering you by asking too much right now, you’re just being really helpful, so I thought I’d try getting a little help with investment choices as well, I really can’t stress how little I currently know about this market.
Right now, bitcoin looks a little bad to someone as inexperienced as me, but I’m thinking it’s best to invest right now while it’s dipping. I mean, it’s gonna rise back up pretty soon for sure, right? And BCH seems kinda scammy to me, do you think I’m right to stay away from it or should I join in now to get a taste of the bump?
