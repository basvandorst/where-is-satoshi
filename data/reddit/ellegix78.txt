Hi, Adriano.
It seems that difference with my method is that who lend money has a partial control of what's happening through multisig address, instead of your paper wallet. 
Nowadays people doesn't trust too much exchanges that maintain byself bitcoins.

the answer is Jailbreak
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:11:15
we can retry the experiment with charity purpose... 
but personally i will not share directly the private key because there could be bots that sweep address automatically.
if someone thinks it's a good experiment i can retry for charity purpose.

1000 bits 
because you had my same idea in the same day.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:09:11
Malwares probably use the same address.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:53:40
me too :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:28:58
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:12:58
of course, did you ever heard about ssl malleability?
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:12:08
yes i was scammed by mtgox... 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:38:08
Could you explain me what is bitcoin fungibility?
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:51:53
100 bits @_date: 2014-04-28 15:27:54
Ok, thanks for your clarification. I waste just 1 hour to make unuseful website :)

500 bits
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:48:23
it's a good idea, but without a third party service is not possible. multisig require 100% agreement to sign a transaction.
what if we collect 1billion and someone unfortunately die?
[Edit: Maybe we can share a single key with two trusted parties]
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:07:46
just a lucky coin for your adventure 1 bit
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:32:18
every time people records videos in vertical mode 1 bitcoin is destroyed.
say no to vertical video syndrome

panic selling
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:32:21
yes, it could happen. If miners won't include your transaction without fee your money doesn't move at all. 
You should resend it with a small fee.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:25:49
ok i got it.
But i don't want to track the flow of stolen coins, because i know that it is pratically impossible (you could mix coins, exchange and other). 
I don't want a blacklist. Anyone could do what he wants with this datas.
What's wrong with knowning that a particular address received a lot of theft report? 
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:04:56
i like tips party 100 bits @_date: 2014-04-25 19:11:17
yes, but i don't understand why people go in panic so easily. They don't really trusts bitcoins? people are so stupid to sell at lower than they bought?
@_date: 2014-05-04 09:31:47
never deleted blochchain.info app
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:44:49
The purpose of this website is to submit theft events, in order to track stolen coins, tag addresses on blockchain.info and help other people to avoid the same mistake with scammers or hackers that use this address.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:37:48
it is useful also for statistical purpose. Like theft report on police station. 
Who actually track how many people are victim?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:47:33
no mnemonic phrase? no email? yes you are screwed.
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:22:44
no i just want track stolen coin.
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:16:26
i must confess... i tried to scan the private key in the video :)
Btw good idea
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:31:30


Normal people don't see usually serial numbers. Bitcoin users use addresses daily.

120 bits
@_date: 2014-04-30 06:30:03
it doesn't exist, almost publicly... some develop bruteforcer in python. 
Personally i tried to bruteforce just for fun with a vb.net software, but it's hard work, because you should check if address has balances in, so for each wallet you need to query blockchain database. It doesn't Worth, because a lot of crackers have the same ideas of wallets with million of private Keys preloaded ready to swept funds with bot software.

I understand that anyone can flag whatever addresses, but for example, you have chrome extension that steal your coins, you'll search for the destination address and you have an hint for what happens on your pc and remove this extension.
If someone flags innocent address it is an attack toward specific person, and he could change the address. 
Anyone on the web could tell that you are a thief or scammer but without a lot of proofs people won't believe you.
I suppose it useful for someone, and i don't think i could damage anyone with this service.
@_date: 2014-05-01 00:08:07
if some miners will stop mining, the difficulty decrease and will be still profitable. satoshi was pure genius about this mechanism

i read the post, but sorry, i think i was misunderstood. My approach is totally different. They want certify users, avoid anonymity. 
My project is something smaller, useful for other things like i said is like to report a crime to police in anoymous manner. Maybe you find this unuseful, other not.

the app tries to execute codes that normally are not allowed to run outside the jail environment. If the operation success then the phone is jailbroken
