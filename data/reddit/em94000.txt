Yes, agreed.
The linked tweet is yet another example of someone sitting on the sidelines, not looking at the big picture, and saying they know what someone else should have done in the  past.
There is something useful in the message, but simply directing a request to trezor for the features one wants is a far more constructive and less arrogant way to get that message across. 
Notice in the reply from the trezor team how they point out that they are already working on it.
Pouliot comes off as whiny and short sighted here by only focusing on what he wants in the short term and not the ecosystem in which he does business. 
Thanks to the OP for showing me that I should not do business with any company he has any control over, and for showing how gracefully the trezor team handled his whining

I might be missing something here, but they seem to reuse BTC deposit addresses. I hope I am wrong, because this is a giant no no

have you seen the amounts of coke, alcohol and cigarettes that guy consumes? 
My money is on a real heart attack.
I'm not willing to bet my left nut on it or anything, tho

good OP.
 It highlights the evolving underlying mindset of  those of us in the community, and society in general.
In the beginning of our BTC journey, we come here to this inner circle to share our excitement about how much we have, partly because we BTC hodlers are still a relatively small group. 
We are the select few who who "get it". 
 I am not in the 1 BTC club yet, but it's easy for me to happy for  those who are because people  who are excited about getting to 1 BTC that they come to this virtual clubhouse to share the news are part of this little group that I am in.
~~If I ever~~ get to 1 BTC I think it will generally be considered "regular money" by then. EDIT: ***by the time*** I get to 1 BTC  (think positive think positive think positive!)
