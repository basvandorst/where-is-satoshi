I've used Bitstamp, and Transferwise to get the money into Bitstamp. Seems to be the cheapest way at the moment.

Wow. That was a fantastic post.

It's there to give a fixed and finite money supply and level of inflation.

If it was legitimately recorded in the blockchain they wouldn't have much choice.

Fascinating, thanks. I wonder whether Satoshi will one day unveil himself/themselves and emerge as the richest person in the world.

Look into using Transferwise ( for cheap EUR/USD transfers and Bitstamp. Bitstamp's prices aren't quite as good as MtGox but you'll get it done quicker, which is more valuable at the moment.

Nope. You only get transaction fees if you successfully mine a block. If you want to play around it's quicker to buy BTC on an exchange.

Interestingly, it's currently impossible for Bitcoin to become an off-planet currency, because the time delay for signals to reach a colony on Mars, say, is greater than the average block time of 10 minutes. So while Bitcoin might make it to the moon, it will never make it to Mars without a serious protocol change.

I find that generosity is a dish best served in very specific amounts.

It's because you can't do worthwhile mining with GPUs any more, the difficulty is too high.

All it would take is an agreement among Bitcoin devs and miners. If someone pointed a gun at me containing a bullet that was fired with all the energy in the universe, I'd probably agree to a protocol change that permitted one more BTC to be mined.

The Bitcoin protocol already supports an escrow-like service, but without having to transfer funds to anyone.
What happens is you create a transaction that requires the signature of two out of three parties. So if both the buyer and the seller agree, the transaction goes through without requiring the escrow role. If the buyer and the seller disagree, then the third party playing the escrow role can decide what to do via mediation and decide to sign the transaction for either the buyer or seller.
See  for more details.

One difference is that the difficulty of mining gold is fixed. The difficulty of mining bitcoin varies. If it gets too hard for some people to make money they will stop mining bitcoin, the difficulty will go down and the rest will continue to make money. And everyone else will be sure that a block will be mined every ten minutes.

Best bet at the moment is bank transfer using Transferwise ( and then into Bitstamp. I've had two successful transactions this way in the past week.

Watch Mike Hearn's video here: 
He talks about a large number of possible Bitcoin features which are already implementable today, including a service that enables something similar to escrow, but still allows for mediation in cases of contract dispute. Importantly, it means that the buyer, seller and mediator don't need to trust each other for it to work.

It's similar to mining gold, which started off so easy that primitive civilisations could do it. Now it requires massive investment and expertise to get fairly small amounts. Bitcoin's the same.

It could be worse - if the transfer had shown an hour ago you'd have bought near the peak.

I've been wondering whether anyone has spent the earliest bitcoins mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Has anyone done any work tracking them down to see whether there's been any movement in those wallets from the early days?

I think you overestimate how willing companies will be to lie about taxes. It's already possible for companies to pay their staff in cash and avoid paying taxes but most don't, because they don't want to break the law.
The biggest threat that I can see to tax departments is that most of their staff will be replaceable by shell scripts that track the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:44:56
It's possible using the protocol already, but not implemented in clients. See:

Governments can implement taxation pretty easily - arguably, more easily than they can without bitcoin. They can just require companies to declare which bitcoin addresses they have used during the financial year (for paying staff or receiving money) and demonstrate that they have taken the necessary taxes for the relevant transactions. And those transactions will be visible in the blockchain so can be easily audited. As far as I can see, Bitcoin is an absolute gift to the tax system.

They would if they were threatened with a sufficiently powerful weapon. Say...one which wielded all the energy in the universe?
