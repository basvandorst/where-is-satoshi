I sell bitcons through Western Union and Money Gram, You just go over to a local western union/Money gram and deposit money. Once i pick it up i release the bitcoins instantly. It's as easy as going to walmart! The transaction is safe because it's in Escrow from a reputable website. Check me out here 
What are you waiting for?

I guess white hats can be jerks too.
Why on earth do you feel so inclined to scan my entire page for a link 
Yeah i get $10 if someone signs up but so do they too. It's a win win situation, and you have the nerve to archive my website and repost this Toxic nonsense as if i really care?

There is a bunch of different ways for Paypal selling.
The most safest way is selling a cheap item on ebay say a bottle cap for $100 when the buyer wants $100 worth of bitcoin you make them purchase your bottle cap for $100 this way you are protected by both ebay and paypal sellers protection But this can take days to complete(Mostly good for large orders)
You may also verify someone ID before they make  Paypal purchase (make sure the ID matches the Paypal account never accept paypal accounts that are unverified.) Make them take a picture with there ID. I know sellers who just skype call to there buyers to see if they sound sketchy.
In all fairness there is a huge risk in selling through paypal, You will get scammed but i find after a while you sort of just build up a client base with legit people who aren't scammers and you can just live off that without even needing paxful.
