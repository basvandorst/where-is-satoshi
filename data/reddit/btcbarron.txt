I'm not worried, because when IBLT's are implemented it will be possible to only construct blocks with transactions that every node already has a copy of.  While not a feature that will be implemented, if it becomes an issue a soft fork can be implemented to make it impossible for miners to fill blocks with spam that does not already reside on every node on the network.

There is a difference between inclusive centralization and exclusive centralization.
When a private company wants to be the intermediary in transactions that is exclusive centralization. I can't copy or audit your actions.
If running a full node becomes too expensive for the average person it is inclusive centralization because I can still choose to run a full node if I needed to.
The block size debate is about how large blocks will be 2 years from now. How can anybody use today's network for a simulation and say that in 2 years this won't work because everything will remain the same?
My mobile phone can upload 38mb/sec and download 90mb/sec on a 4G connection that costs £24/month toady, 2 years from now that will be much more common. 
The last simulation I saw used a 1mb/sec upstream connection.

Keep in mind that if they designed a 110nm or 55nm ASIC today it would probably be more efficient than the ones produced years ago.

It's not the job of core devs to dictate what node operators are capable of running or doing.
It is disingenuous to claim that node count is going down.  
To claim that node count went from 100,000 to 6000 as we now know is incorrect.
The fact is the numbers of publicly available nodes could in fact be higher now than when nodes behind routers where counted.

That can be done now anyways.  You need 2 petahashes of mining power to solve 1 block a day.  That requires a lot of time and money to simply spam a block on the network.  Nothing will happen. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:48:04
The current blocksize limit is what is preventing core performance characteristics from improving. With your logic it will never be raised.
When members of the core dev team who tweet why bitcoin won't work or will fail every week does not exactly give people confidence.  
People expect that from banks and other paper-mill competitors but not from members of the core dev team.
The only thing that will improve core performance characteristics is a larger block size, which will lead to higher usage/price, which leads to more nodes and mining coming online.

@_date: 2015-05-26 15:48:21
I think that should be left alone, instead focus on a "layer 2" solution.
You give away time for the network to reach consensus without adding any new features.
If it changes it from a 10 minute block time to a X minute block time it still won't solve the need for instant payments. 
We will still have occurrences where it takes 20 to 30 minutes to find the next block even if block  times are set to lets say 5 minutes. This happens at least once a week.
People will still say it takes to long to wait X minutes at checkout.

Bitcoin should be structured for success.
Visa &amp; Mastercard processed $5.3 trillion in transactions in 2010
Souce: 
The problem with talking about miner fee's is that we have to start speculating about the price of Bitcoin as well. Then the conversation goes off topic because it just does.
So instead lets just talk about daily transaction volume in fiat.
Let's assume that Bitcoin can grab 1% of the daily tx volume of Visa and MasterCard.
5.3 Trillion * 0.02 / 365 = $145 Million a day. (not too scary to imagine) 
If miners charged 0.5% per tx that would equal $725,000 a day in miners fees. Not including block reward, which is not far off from the $800,000 a day miners are currently earning.
And that's with just 1% of Visa and MasterCards Volume.
Also keep in mind Bitcoin will enable billions of people who currently don't have access to any form of card services.

haha, I'm taking into account that initially main stream users would probably start using Bitcoin with offchain services like changetip, circle etc. With an average size of 3MB blocks that would be about 1 million tx a day. If I had to have a wild guess that would translate into maybe 5 to 10 million offchain tx a day.

Acutally its dick-corner not place
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:55:42
In your post you mentioned 10MB blocks, which would allow for at least 4 million tx a day. That would be useful, and the network could support that.
I'm not saying let's go to 100MB blocks tomorrow, but 1MB blocks would leave Bitcoin vulnerable to being overtaken by an altcoin.
What the network is capable of is a matter of fact based on available data, and the block size should be at least 50% the size of what the network is capable of.
With invertible bloom filters,pruning &amp; hard disk space per dollar I don't see 20MB blocks being a problem, when they are ready.
Centralized mining and the future of it is another debate.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:53:19
Not without significant expense. Plus invertible bloom filters makes this much less of a problem.
It would also be very easy to see who is doing it.
@_date: 2015-05-10 19:27:24
transaction per second and mining capacity are not correlated.  Mining capacity is market driven. If its not profitable the capacity will drop off along with the difficulty. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:20:38
It requires a lot of hashing power to create a block.
If you are a pool and you start behaving badly you risk losing miners.
If you are a solo miner with the sole intention of disrupting bitcoin you would need to invest in a lot of hardware and electricity to create a disruptive flow of bloated blocks.
For example, right now one of the most efficient miners is the antminer s5 which hashes at 1.1Th/sec @ 550 Watts.
It requires today 2 Peta hashes of computing power to create 1 block a day.
To generate 2 peta hashes you would need  1819 Antminer S5.
At about $400 inc shipping and taxes that would cost $727,000.
You would also need 1000 Kilowatts. Even at 5 cents/kwhour that would cost $1200 day.
All of this to create 1 bloated block per day.

Right now an ASIC can do 2 Gigahashes per watt. 
If you have millions of devices using an extra watt of power, not so idiotic.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:28:08
I don't understand why anybody would be against a larger block.  Satoshi himself envisioned much larger blocks. Right now bitcoin can handle about 400,000 to 600,000 tx a day. That's not enough for anything to work on a global scale.
EDIT: Also the only reason there is a limit in the first place is to prevent people from spamming the network at the start when btc was cheap. 
EDIT 2: What Theymos said is true, it's what the network is capable of not what we want.  Based on available data what the network is capable of should be a matter of fact much more so than opinion.

@_date: 2015-05-26 14:40:09
I think one of the sticking issues is how larger blocks would effect the market for transactions.
If there is no pressure or value in sending a transaction on the network ie. no or low fees this would strain the system.
But right now we have a market place that works with 50% block sizes being full.
Having a dynamic block-size that maintains the current market pressure on transactions should alleviate concerns of market place dynamics.
I think it would help if the core devs that have issues with increasing the block size explicitly state what their concerns are and what they propose.
It sounds like there are some people that are just saying no its not a good idea and just leaving it at that.

This is now a common pattern, and nobody buys it.

This is not a technical matter, this is an issue of vocabulary.

No, the longest chain won.

They can also shutdown the the fiberoptic links to a country, which would make all the nodes in that country not so useful according to you, which has happened before actually more than once.

“There's no wide consensus about this topic in SatoshiLabs. My personal opinion is that it really does not matter too much. I think Bitcoin will work normally with 1MB limit as well as with 20MB** limit and I don't see any catastrophic ends in any case.”

@_date: 2015-08-16 13:27:31
Miners will ultimately decide how large blocks are to maintain a fee market.
This will be a market decision. 
The block size in XT is simply a hard limit to stop block bloat. Block size will be considerably smaller than that of the hard limit for the foreseeable future.

This graph says that it is urgent: [
By the first quarter of 2016 the average daily volume of transactions will fill blocks.
Then we will have a volatile currency AND a volatile transaction fee.
It's been 7 years, what time frame where you thinking of? Another 7 Years?
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:15:39
You mean keep the 1MB limit around for long enough so the momentum behind Bitcoin fizzles away? It's been 7 years! What exactly are you waiting for. Right now we can do 250K tx per day at best. Which single global application is that good enough for?
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:01:25
8GB blocks would be in 20 years.  
The miners would still have control over how large blocks would be.
If they feel that the fee market would benefit them more with smaller blocks or that the network would operate more efficiently letting block size grow slower than the hard limit then they can still do that.
In the same way miners had a soft limit of 750K blocks when the hard limit was 1MB.
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:18:25
The Merkel root of a 1MB block is the same size as a 100MB block.
Once that is calculated the cost and time of hashing it with the other hashes required to construct a valid block is the same.
The point being that the probability of solving a block with 1 Giga hash is the same regardless of weather the blocksize is 1MB or 8MB.
The time difference in calculating the merkel root of a larger block on a decent cpu is negligible, we are talking milliseconds. Keep in mind that at best it costs $3000/day in electricity to solve a single block every 24 hours, so the cost a a fast CPU is not in the equation of weather or not a miner is profitable.
The only valid concern of larger blocks is the propagation time, which has been taken into account and limited to grow with the growth rate of the internet.
It's up to miners to be efficient, if their profits decrease slightly because of an orphaned block every now and then that's just how it works.
Plus miners still have control over how large blocks will be. If a miner in China wants to keep making 1MB blocks to remain profitable then that's what they will do.
We are not trying to change the market dynamics of how miners operate. We are simply letting them have the opportunity to create larger blocks. We don't want the growth of bitcoin to be limited by a line of code that was never meant to be part of the network.

Actually with satellite internet you can for $700/month.
If you pulling in more than 1 Petahash you can afford that.
Plus you don't need 100mbps you only need 10mbs. Fine you might orphan a block every now and then. That's just the way it is.
It's statistically fare, note absolutely fare.

When a transaction is in the mem pool it's being "handled" when it's in the block it's "processed".
Technically your example is a one to many tx. Any pizzeria couldn't have 10,000 individuals in there each placing orders. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:29:18
$30/month is the top end of cost for a full dedicated server that does nothing but run bitcoin core and can handle full 8MB blocks for 5 years.
Most people run their nodes from home, business or dorm room, so the cost of their broadband connection is already a sunk cost.
The fact is node count was well over 100,000, but then we changed the way  we measured node count by only counting nodes that are publicly accessible. 
Accessible Node count dropped because the initial excitement and price of bitcoin tapered off.
If you don't believe node count will increase with the increased popularity of bitcoin either in terms of tx per day or price then how do you feel it's going to work at all? The reason why people voluntarily run nodes is because they feel that bitcoin will work and they believe in it.
Policies have to be made in anticipation of success, not a slow death where you try to keep the patient alive as long as possible.

This is not a correct statement. The history will remain the same up until the fork occurred. 
At the moment it costs about $3000/day in electricity to mine a single block, nobody is going to wait around to see if the loosing chain comes back. The switch will happen very quickly.
Miners will collude with each other very quickly as they have invested 10's of millions of dollars in equipment &amp; facilities. 
This "contentious" issue is made up, if some people on Reddit want to turn this into some kind of battle to the death that's fine, but the people who have invested over 1 billion dollars into bitcoin will just stick to the plan, because there is no issue and block size can grow without consequence. 
The fact that one company is going against the entire Bitcoin Eco system to push it's own product is fascinating, especially when you consider their product would still work and be successful if they let the blocksize grow.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:28:21
There are a lot of people who have been part of Bitcoin from the beginning that know just as much if not more than anybody else who is claiming to keep the block size the same.
The fact that you think Gavin doesn't know what he's talking about just shows you have no idea what you are talking about.
There is quite a large list of people who know what there doing that don't have a problem with larger blocks.
The fact is this whole issue is made up. It never existed before.

Any miner large enough to pump out at least **ONE** block a day has to spend just over $3000 a day  in electricity.
Anybody that can spend **$3000/day** on electricity can afford a decent internet connection.
And if you don't have access to the internet?
I was on an island in the middle of the indian ocean, we had satellite internet and the ping time was 60ms to the UK.
If you can afford the electricity you can afford a satellite uplink, it's $700/month which is not a significant cost relative to buying 2500 Antminer S5 and paying $3K a day to produce just ONE block.

**Full Node vs. SPV**
It is important to distinguish between block height verification and block depth verification.
A full node client verifies that all preceding blocks are valid in order to guarantee that a transaction is valid. Currently only the Satoshi client, libbitcoin, and btcd do full node verification. Full nodes are the fundamental anchor of trustless security in the Bitcoin system.
A client verifies the depth D of a block by checking that there are D blocks after it (also called "confirmations"), all of which are well-formed. SPV clients don't verify the preceding blocks, they use the number of confirmations (whether they are valid or not) as a measure of the likelihood of a block chain reorganization producing a new longer fork which excludes the transaction.

The more "sophisticated" way would still require 150 MB blocks to compete with VISA and Master Card, leaving nothing behind for people who wanted to transact directly on the core protocol.
There is only so much information that can be recorded in 1 MB, no matter how sophisticated that use of space is.
What if other people want to develop an even more sophisticated system when all the space is being used up? How would that system ever get traction.
The first system gets their foot in the door when fees are near zero, then the fee's get hiked up preventing other payment systems from getting the same chance they did even if they are much better.

I have yet to here a single argument against larger blocks that isn't just a bunch of meaningless repetitive drivel. 
At the end of the day Node operators have a say in what they are willing to run, it's not up to the core devs to impose their financial and bandwidth limitations on to other people.
The fact is running a quad core server with 2 TB of HD with 10TB of bandwidth a month costs $30/month. That is less than the monthly fee most credit card processing merchants charge. As a business expense it's negligible. To assume that there are not at least a couple of bitcoin related business in every country in the world that wouldn't run a full node for their own benefit is ridiculous.

I think he is referring to the Block Version Integer which can be used as a voting mechanism.
Right now it's at 3. So if the proposal is agreed upon by miners (pools and farms) they would change their mining software to issue blocks with a version number 4.
Then over time everybody will be able to see what percentage of the network is producing version 4 blocks.

For a transaction to be statistically secure, there needs to be 1 hour of "work" after it. 
Weather you split that up into 60 one minute confirmation or 6 ten minute confirmations makes no difference.
10 Minutes was chosen to allow for global propagation of blocks in a way that minimizes  orphanes.
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:06:30
Not really, it's was chosen because when Satoshi did simulations of histogram distributions of how tall two heads of the block chain could simultaneously exist on the network it showed that it was statistically possible for orphaned blocks to reach a height of 3 to 4 blocks every now and then. So while choosing 60 Minutes exactly might be arbitrary the time frame in general is not.

It wouldn't be a bad idea if the funding for each was separate and that there was a firewall between the two.
For example if individual members want their money to go exclusively towards development there should be a way for them to choose that.
Life time members may like to contribute additional funds towards development but only if they can be sure it will end up in the dev's pockets without a huge administrative cut.

While this does not cap the rate or amount of data, it will use far less bandwidth then a node with maxconnections set to 128.

Since the start of bitcoin, mining power has been measured in hashes per second. Its understood that its a double hash.

1TB HD costs $50
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:23:43
 
I pay £29/month for 1TB HD and 10TB of Bandwidth on a dedicated server.
£200 setup fee to pay a one off charge for the hard disk, cpu and extra ram.
It's actually a really cool hosting company you pay for the server specs and the monthly charge stays the same.
Right now my node uses 380GB/Month with 70 to 80 connections.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:49:17
Well millions of people seem to be able to seed terabytes of HD movies per month from their home with no real gain to themselves without issue.
In a couple of years even the worst broadband connection will be better than whats available today.
Even if the hard limit for block size is lifted today it will be at least a year until blocks are over 2mb in size.

@_date: 2013-12-27 18:56:34
Difficulty adjustment only makes changes based on how long it took to create the last 2016 blocks, which should be exaclty 14 days. It has no memory past 14 days.
2016 blocks x 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes / 60 = 336 / 24 = 14 days

Your feelings on the price of bitcoin are directly related to how many crashes you've been through. If this is your first crash, then you may be freaking out. If this is your second ($266 high) your probably a bit annoyed. If this is your third ($33 high) your probably not really concerned.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:56:31
The difficulty was ONE for all of 2009. That's so painful to look at lol.

You should report that to coinbase, If somebody took the time to create that address the chances are they have the private key as well.  Their wallet software may be comprised.

Did you ever play satoshi dice with that wallet?
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:33:12
Also there is an economic difference between raising the limit when needed vs. not having a limit. The network has to PROVE that the block size needs to increased.  Remember a tx fee is basically a bid to be included in the limited space of 1MB.

Just a bit of sensationalism, but in theory if somebody did purchase 33k of btc in one go the price would spike to $1000.

Because it's a better way of measuring organic growth vs. a bad actor which temporaily tries to spam the network.  Growth of averages vs. an unlimited block size which could easily corrupt all the databases.  Remember what happened with the last fork. A small unknown limit in the old dbberkerly code caused the whole network to grind to a halt.

Bitcoil is down for maintenance. Demand for buying bitcoins in Israel has increased by a factor of 100 in 4 months and despite working on the issues at a frantic pace, it will take time for us to adjust to the new situation. We are working on building the legal, financial, technical and operational infrastructure required to handle the greatly increased demand.
If your order has already been confirmed you can still transfer the money and receive the bitcoins. And we're still continuing to confirm already placed orders according to our waiting list. But we're not accepting new orders.
We hope to resume full operations in a few weeks.

In the same way difficulty is adjusted every 2048 blocks, block size could be dynamically adjusted as well.  
So if the previous 2048 blocks were at an average capacity of lets say 80% then the block size would double every time that limit was reached.
That way the code would only have to be hard forked once instead of everytime the blocks started getting full.
