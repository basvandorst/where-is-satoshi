If China has specified Sep. 30, what *could* that mean for btc, assuming they follow through with their "regulations."

I can't help but feel like this is caveman discussion . . .
"Bitcoin Bad." "No, Bitcoin Good!"
I'm a layperson, but how far off is this take on things:
The U.S. financial system has some really bad drawbacks. The 2008 crisis and ensuing recession exemplified quite a few of those drawbacks. 
This led to the rise of Bitcoin, which is a form of "cryptocurrency." Cryptocurrency is essentially digital money, and it's rise had been two decades in the making. 
Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology, a highly intriguing but controversial system that has a lot of potential uses. 
Bitcoin as an investment is high risk, because no one can predict the future. High risk implies high reward, meaning that investing at the right times could lead to considerable profits. It also implies the potential for big losses, meaning that the golden rule of investing applies, as always: only invest what you're comfortable losing. 
The future of Bitcoin is unpredictable. Investors hope it will continue to thrive, while fiat currency advocates continually allude to its inevitable downfall. 
While Bitcoin's future is unclear, the fact that big players in the established banking system have been experimenting with blockchain technology for years, as well as the current trend of digitization, means that the future of cryptocurrency itself is somewhat more clear: it is, almost certainly, the future of money. 
Will Bitcoin lead that charge? Or will it falter under pressure from many sides, and go down in history instead as the precursor to 21st century cryptocurrency and the widespread use of blockchain technology? 
There are no answers to these questions. Yet.

But - and I'm honestly not sure - do you really have control of your phone? Many people leave their phones to auto-connect to any and every public wi-fi, which is pretty unsafe.

I'm also 5. 
I'm *downloading* the wallet, so should I also back it up when I put the btc in? What about a purely online wallet like Blockchain Bit Wallet? 
Thanks.
