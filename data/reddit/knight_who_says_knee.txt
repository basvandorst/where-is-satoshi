If you keep your investment small, it's something fun to keep an eye on. I see my $500 dollars spent as a "low risk, high reward" investment...not enough spent to mean anything but the ceiling is so high it might just make a difference down the road.

A million dollars per coin? I'm as optimistic as anyone, but I'll never see that in my lifetime. I think a market cap of a trillion at 50k a coin is much more realistic as a top end in the next several decades

I ran into this same issue making a bitcoin parking payment app for a class.  In most parking garages, you dont have good cell reception.  That makes paying for parking with bitcoin rather difficult.

I've been meaning to get my 2 coins off of coinbase ever since I bought them a year ago, but I'm too lazy.  Would it be sufficient to just move them to my hard drive and do a backup?

Is the halvening really expected to make a difference?  What happened with past halvenings?

Are you saying it would get to be too big to be practical?

What effect will that have on the price?  I know that there will be less supply to meet demand, but does that usually translate to a price increase?

Is somebody working on this yet?
