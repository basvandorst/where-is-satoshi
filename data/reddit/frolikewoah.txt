Now this is interesting. This could be an unintended consequence of crypto currency. Anonymous donations to politicians? Get that idea out to corporate america today and Bitcoin will be officially recognized tomorrow.

Ridiculous. When someone gets murdered with a knife, do you arrest the person who sold it to them?

You misunderstand how BTC works. You can't just move coins on or off ledger. They are always accounted for in the block chain.

I wouldnt say it'll be ineffective. You will make your money back and be "in the green" eventually. The question is how long that will take. That will depend on the difficulty changes. Keep in mind too, that mining rig won't get toyou for several months due to the back order.
