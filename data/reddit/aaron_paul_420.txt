"Businesses" was referring to the places you are going to send the homeless to, to spend the bitcoins you gave them.
How is a homeless person going to spend a paper wallet?  You refer them to some bitcoin-accepting stores, great.  When they get there, how do they spend it?  I guess they don't have a smartphone with a data plan, or you would have transferred them Bitcoin using that instead of a paper wallet.  (Or even if some do, I don't think it's reasonable to assume this about most homeless people.)  Let's say they show their wallet's private key to the business, who use that to sign a transaction spending the coins and sending the change back to that paper wallet.  This is what I was talking about when I said "trust these businesses not to save the private key [and use the saved copy to steal from the homeless person]".

Newspaper comparison doesn't make sense to me.  It would actually be like your competitor reproducing your ad within their own ad space.
Regarding trademark vs. copyright, you are probably right.  [CrossFit is getting countersued for a similar usage of DMCA.](  I would imagine WU still have cause for legal action in trademark law, and reportedly Facebook would comply just the same if they had framed it that way instead of DMCA.  They might still even have a case in copyright law, by claiming copyright on the image.  Bottom line, I think WU has a case here but may have gone about it wrong (but, I'm not a lawyer.)  Either way, I'm glad to get to the crux of where they may have specifically done wrong.
Anyway, if "we" care so much about that, why don't we crowdfund a lawsuit, instead of remixing ads that nobody but us really cares about, and patting ourselves on the back for "teaching them the Streisand Effect"?

No, because it's versatile and already there, but I don't think you can just "use the Internet" to support a robust high-volume payment/banking network at the levels needed to do whatever people think of when they imagine "Bitcoin winning."  It may require dedicated backup networks (or even dedicated primary networks, if internet bandwidth costs get crazy in the future.)  Saying "we use less than X% the energy of the banks" sounds good, until you're honest about how bitcoin also does less than X% the transaction volume, is less than X% as robust, etc.  It's not a fair comparison right now.  I'll admit I'm not really equipped to extrapolate a fair comparison so I'll stop.

[made a great analogy]( about how fair-use law doesn't give Weird Al the right to include copies of the original songs along with his parodies.
Now, maybe a DMCA takedown wasn't legally supported, but my non-lawyer opinion is that trademark and copyright law generally, or even just Facebook policy, probably include *some* provision that would allow them to take action here anyway.  At the risk of sounding like "the ends justify the means" or something, the difference seems like something only lawyers would really care to argue about -- this community would be crying abuse no matter which laws or policies WU invoked to get Facebook to take it down.

@_date: 2014-12-01 09:05:10
Maybe, but if you included all the other costs of serious bank-level bitcoin (things like manufacturing secure wallets, redundant networks beefy enough to handle Visa/Mastercard activity levels, huge exchanges) it might get closer.
Also, I think it's hypocritical to feel morally superior in this regard, if you use the "wasteful legacy banking system" at all.  This could include having a bank account, owning stocks, owning precious metals (cost of mining and shipping), using paper fiat money (printing, shipping, authenticating, counting.)  If you're not supporting that waste, good for you, but I doubt half the people that point this out meet that criteria.  In the meantime, you're burning a bunch of energy to support two systems, and the legacy one probably won't die for a decade at least, if ever.  Maybe this inevitability of energy consumption invalidates the whole argument, but that would mean both pointing out the waste and justifying it are not relevant.

You can't really "know" the funds are retrievable, unless you know they won't be spent by someone else before you do.  If the seller manages to double-spend the sold coins before the exchange can, now the exchange has to roll back trades, or something.  If two traders and the arbiter colluded, they can extract free money by double-spending and forcing the exchange to pay the buyer's withdrawal out of pocket.  I guess it would be pretty obvious, and difficult to time this right, though.  The exchange could keep the fiat from this trade and just buy some BTC to cover their loss, so there's no profit for a scamming user.
Anyway, I don't see a lot of benefit to the exchange user.  They have to trust two companies now, and for it to be practical, the arbiter is going to end up just trusting the exchange for most cases.  The exchange could just send fake data to the arbiter to send a bunch of coins to the exchange owner's own wallet, and run with them.
@_date: 2014-11-16 05:50:32
Yeah, and maybe the tipper could even specify which they want to "send", in some way stronger than the "coffee" etc amounts, but not to the point that it's only redeemable for that item.  Maybe ChangeTip even becomes a middleman to send the tippee credit at Amazon or iTunes if they choose.  My cynical side says people wouldn't support that very strongly, since a big part of most peoples' tipping is to support bitcoin.  It could also be messy, if the exchange rate leads to receiving $0.98 if you need $0.99 to buy a song.  Maybe that even implicates money transmission laws that nobody will want to deal with.
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:14:55


I considered this, but is "We know they're criminals but we decided to let them get away with it" really more face-saving than quietly dropping the case, or even losing it?  Hmm, well, I guess "extracted multi-billion dollars fine from international bank" looks better on the resumé than losing in court at least.  The case couldn't have been a complete pushover if HSBC felt $1.9 billion was a bargain to save themselves the trouble and risks of going to court, right?
You probably have good points about general AML law and US authorities' history of weak cases; I don't know a lot about it.  But if every bank in the world is a money launderer (according to USA), how come not all of them (I assume) have been targets of multi-year investigations and billion-dollar settlements?  I think it's because HSBC was more willfully breaking the law.


I'm not calling for the compliance department to be jailed; more fitting would be the executives who did things like hiding compliance-related facts, and creating a rubber-stamp compliance department out of their liquidated credit-card-collections unit with very little training in actual compliance, at whom they got annoyed for actually reporting credible evidence of money laundering or transfers with banned entities (as described in Rolling Stone's article and [Reuters](


I'd appreciate some documentation of this, but I basically believe you.  The problem is, what gives them the right to take advantage of USA's infrastructure but break USA's laws with no consequence?  They have a US charter, which means they are subject to US laws.  They're free to break those laws if they prioritize other laws or contracts higher, and the US authorities are free to prosecute them for it.  I don't know what they "should" have chosen, but I don't see why they should not be held accountable for their choice just because "they needed to do it."  If it's such a lose/lose situation, why don't they shut down their US subsidiaries?
I can follow your response about the Mexico situation, but it does not address what I find to be most egregious, "a so-called 'Cayman Islands branch' of HSBC Mexico."  How can this not be considered deliberate subversion of the law and obfuscation of the source of the funds and identity of the accountholders?  That's getting close to laundering money in itself.  I'm guessing US law got involved because they moved the funds into the US, which seems reasonable.  Again, if they're subject to US law/regulations, why should they get a pass just because they don't want to be subject to US law/regulations?
I'll put the book on my list, but I don't find mistrust of the US government to be a compelling argument.  Why do you trust HSBC's version more, or any other government?  Every government has reasons to lie about the strength of their case; every bank has reasons to lie about any money laundering they're doing.  I guess this argument can be turned back on me.  I'll admit I tend to trust USG's version, but I don't feel like you have to trust them a lot to see that HSBC broke US law (how dysfunctional those laws may be, is another issue.)

I ask this semi-rhetorically, but it could be a productive discussion: What is someone, who doesn't already use Bitcoin, going to do with a $1 tip?
Are there any worthwhile digital goods you can buy that cheaply?  I say worthwhile, because some of us will buy pretty much anything if it's priced in Bitcoin, but is there a place you can legally buy, say, a Taylor Swift song for $1 in BTC? (Or maybe $2)  (Edit: Just got reminded of Humble Bundle. It's technically not buying, it's time-limited, and $1 probably won't unlock anything special, but maybe I'll accept this.)
Is there a way to get $1 to your bank account or something else more cash-like to the average person, without losing 30-40% in fees?  Why would someone bother setting it up, even if they could get the full dollar?  Even if they think of holding out until they have like $20, are they going to set up a wallet/account to receive their first $1?
I think the answer is there's nothing really, but anyone can take this as a challenge to find something the average person can and would easily obtain with their $1 tip.  (This might even apply up to $5 for a lot of potential tip recipients.)  Maybe you should, along with the tip, give pointers on how they might spend it, if you believe there are such options.
Despite talk of "OMG changetip is going viral!" this is why I think there is not a lot of genuine activity outside of and similar places.  Half the tipping here even seems pointless or driven by begging.

This situation has made me wonder if the Tor hidden service feature could be upgraded to have something like a list of related keys that supersede each other.  You keep key N on the server for use, and keys N+1, N+2, etc., somewhere safe.  If key N gets compromised, you announce a new hidden service descriptor signed with key N+1, and everyone rejects anything key N says.  This might require more state and consensus tracking than is implemented in tor right now.  I think the crypto could work like bitcoin HD wallets.

I thought there is only one private key corresponding to, say, silkroadvb5piz3r.onion .  When that gets compromised, you have to generate a new key, and thus a new address.  Am I misunderstanding?
A workaround, which you might be referring to, could be publishing from the outset a list of alternate, inactive addresses that will be moved to if the original is compromised.  Keep those keys off the server for security.  I suppose a user would need some out-of-band way to find out it's compromised (if a law enforcement agency doesn't make it obvious), but if they hear it has been, they could look at their record of those addresses and find one that is active, and be fairly confident it is the same entity as before.

Coinbase automatically logging-in to your bank is a normal option in their bank account verification process, at least last time I did it.  (The slower option is to have them deposit a few cents and you tell them the amounts when they show up in your statement, IIRC.)  If you think that is risky, I can't really argue against it.  I just wonder if you thought a Coinbase support staffer was manually logging in with credentials given over the phone or something.
Changing your password after Coinbase verifies would probably be a good idea though, even if you trust them and feel that no third party could have intercepted the credentials over the wire or something.

The point of tipping, is so they can tip other people?  I'd rather everyone kept their money to themselves instead of shuffling bits around in circles, unless they truly feel moved to make a more meaningful donation.  Regarding affording, you're the one who's decided people should tip "several times a day", not me.
I guess I just have a different philosophy.  I've tipped several developers $5+ when they published an address.  Giving a non-user a generic unsolicited tip so small, that they will spend more in time than it's worth, is just rude and insulting IMO.  If they already use Bitcoin, that threshold can go lower, but personally it still gets silly to go less than $1.  If you think you can't "afford" that, then stop tipping altogether and save your money; or stop making tiny tips just for the sake of tipping, so you have something meaningful to give when you find something you really want to support.
Now, I guess you can't know exactly who uses Bitcoin already, but on the other hand the drive lately to get out in other subreddits and communities and "rain bits" is clearly intended to target people who don't use it.

How do you know they've all been compensated completely as of this moment?  And, I don't think many people would call having their money disappear for a few hours to days, through no fault of their own, something they're going to shrug off soon like you imply.  But, whatever, that's subjective.

If the "unproven allegations" were weak like you're implying, why would the authorities say the following?


More quotes from the Taibbi article:


I'm not a lawyer, so I won't say whether this was actually illegal, and in a multinational company it may not even be all that unethical.. but it certainly undermines excuses about how "they didn't know" and gives the US authorities fair reason to not want people like this in the system even if it's not currently illegal. (Apparently financial stability concerns outweighed that, though.)




Falsifying documents; HSBC is not a hapless scapegoat.


This is far beyond failing an expectation that "a bunch of random Mexican bank tellers and middle managers [would] fight the cartels" (quote from another comment of yours), it's actively circumventing controls through regulatory sleight-of-hand.  Indeed, the tellers and middle managers may be blameless in this case, but it seems obvious to me that the executives and attorneys who created this farce weren't acting in good faith.
I acknowledge it's not black and white, AML laws are complicated and unjust, etc., but IMO you are far oversimplifying in the other direction.  Yes, HSBC probably didn't literally have people on the cartel payroll or something, but they weren't a perfectly innocent and well-meaning victim of silly American laws or bullying either.  (P.S. I know Matt Taibbi isn't exactly even-handed, but I think I've selected some objective quotes.)

I think most people are (reluctantly, perhaps) OK with "blockchain.info", the problem is the company being called simply "Blockchain", so that phrases such as "Blockchain security breach", "my blockchain wallet got hacked", "Blockchain down" have the possibility of giving false impressions about the core Bitcoin technology.  (I gave negative examples, but I wouldn't want "Blockchain receives $x million funding", "Blockchain server upgrades", "Blockchain releases new features" either.)

I wonder how secure Android's factory reset is, anyway.  Would not surprise me if stuff could be recovered with a full image dump and file carving software, if the phone repair guys are willing and able to go that far.
I think the usual best practice is to enable encryption (if haven't already), which encrypts in-place, then factory reset.  If they dump it, it's now just random data, since the encryption key (hopefully) got overwritten in the reset.

I think the theory is that if you just type "blockchain.info" into your address bar, it may make an un-protected HTTP request first, which then redirects to HTTPS. A malicious tor exit node could replace that redirection with some malicious look-alike domain with HTTPS and some users wouldn't notice.
If you bookmark the correct HTTPS URL and only use that, you should be OK, which is good security practice whether or not you use tor.

But we know we *can*.  Whether we *will*, and what happens afterwards, are mildly interesting questions whose answers could impart insights on human nature, ethics, etc.
I still don't really see how it's much different than a lottery, sweepstakes, crowdfunding, etc. -- sure, it's not exactly any of those, but are the differences really all that interesting?
Administering it all in Bitcoin with provable fairness etc., could be interesting. But keeping people from entering multiple times is probably an unsolved problem, and there are probably not enough Redditors willing to donate $1 via Bitcoin.  The nature of the experiment would change if, say, 100k people are donating $10 each.

The Ripple infrastructure is probably centralized in some way I'm too lazy to research right now, and of course XRP were issued by a centralized entity (but focusing on XRP is missing the point of Ripple, IMO).. but I mean that anyone can start issuing tokens of any kind to anyone, and there is no special entity in charge of redeeming tokens.  For example, a person on Bitcointalk issued [a currency backed by silver dimes]( so that anyone could buy or sell dimes with anything else tradeable on Ripple.  I don't know if it's still going, and admittedly that's the scary part of decentralized currency issuers, but the point is it feels a lot more open than Tether, to me.
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:27:12
Oh yes, centralized tokens from a single company that requires KYC forms to redeem, in only a few currencies, is far superior to Ripple's decentralized, unlimited, and unregulated network! /s

Yeah yeah, premined scamcoin, money-grubbing devs, blah blah, but Ripple could be so much more than XRP.

Because it exists today and has a fairly robust network (or at least did a year or so ago when I last played with it.)  I'm OK with eventually moving to a BTC blockchain-based system with the same flexible properties and adoption, but my sense is nothing else is ready today.  Maybe Mastercoin or Counterparty?  Is there a reputable issuer of say MastercoinUSD, like Bitstamp does on Ripple?  (Actually, if I'm understanding correctly, Tether is an issuer of MastercoinUSD, right?)  I'll be honest, maybe I'm being ignorant here, but maybe that speaks to Ripple having greater adoption, which is necessary for a useful network.
There are probably different strengths depending on what you're looking to do, how often you will use it, how long you are storing value on it, etc.  And I haven't been as plugged-in to the cryptocurrency world lately, compared to when Ripple debuted, so maybe things have changed.  If Tether takes off, maybe it is better than Ripple for some usecases.

They have the right to use the full names Blockchain.info, Blockchain Ltd. (Luxembourg), or Blockchain Luxembourg S.A.R.L. because they are less ambiguous and officially registered.  Satoshi "won the name" of the actual blockchain by inventing it earlier and releasing the code "when no one cared about bitcoin", why doesn't he/his actual creation get exclusive rights to the name by your logic?

I see your point that any place that would take a CC probably has some form of internet access, but that doesn't address the cost and possible roaming issues.  It's hard to know how much your tx will cost to send out while roaming, what else your device will decide to do with your expensive internet connection while it's on, etc.  On my last trip I got caught out when I found I couldn't roam *at all* (SIM from US, was in Morocco) -- now, that was my fault for not confirming beforehand, and I could have bought a local SIM card, but my point is it's extra complication/cost compared to paying with cards.  If the merchant provides free wifi, that's still 30+ extra seconds of setting that up, compared to swiping a card or using cash.  If the "freedom" is worth it to you, OK, but I feel like people try to spin stories about it being cheaper/easier too, when it's not really ready for that.

I can understand saying that with tx fees and tax book-keeping, a $50 lunch in immediately-replaced BTC is more like, say, $50.80 so they should save the $0.80 (and maybe invest it in more BTC), but that's not really what he said.
