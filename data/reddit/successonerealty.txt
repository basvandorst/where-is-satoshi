I don't know about other states, but in AZ it is relatively easy to sell a home without an agent.  1)Buyer &amp; seller come to an agreement on paper. 2) Find any large title company and open escrow.   The title officer will let you know what other documents you may need.  3) Use Bitpay or Coinbase to send your Bitcoins to the title company via wire in US Dollors.  4) once the title company has the wire (&amp; other required documents) then they will release the home to record at the county recorder…..and presto, you just bought a home using Bitcoin.  There are a few steps like inspections and ?? that you may want to know about if you never bought a home before or unsure of the details.  I often offer a very reduced fee to over see a transaction if someone is inexperienced and wants another set of eyes looking for pitfalls.

A seller who hires a real estate broker signs a listing contract with the broker.  In that contract you spell out what and how you'll be paid.  I have taken a commission in various ways even before Bitcoin.  It doesn't have to go through a title company. Or if you did want to use a title company, one would just use Bitpay or Coinbase and have the commission paid to the title company and released at close of escrow.   I also have two properties listed that is currently for for sale via Bitcoin. 2480 sqft home on an acre in the Phoenix area and 22.43 acres in Durango. The sale would be handled through a title company using Bitpay or Coinbase.

On recording docs in AZ one only has to put "Ten Dollars and other valuable consideration".
