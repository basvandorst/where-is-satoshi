Thank you for bringing a smile to my face :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:47:19
Just want to comment that I feel the fact people tipped you this money is just fantastic :)   I love our community &lt;3
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:45:01
Both twins are prominent in the crypto space though.  what a coincidence ;)
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:28:25
Great idea!  my pot is currently empty, but I will immediately tip half of whatever I receive here.  If anything :)

Please follow this link.  The 1000 Gold bitcoins have disappeared.  They were "Unconfirmed Transaction" for a day+.
Now, there are no transactions associated with my address.  Help?

A trustless technology.  A way to control my own money.  A fantastic type of money.  Etc.etc.  
I have been studying business, and I recognize the impact Bitcoin will have, and am excited to see it all play out in the years to come.
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:45:11
yup, something is up.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:39:28
I have already done some of that!  It was very exciting, I'll admit :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:00:04
Yay!  Tipping is awesome.   I will flip whatever tip I receive around, and tip half of it away immediately.
Thanks guys and gals :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:37:13
They don't understand the technology either.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:38:54
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:56:29
LOL  Thanks for the laugh OP!
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:41:13
I had my doubts also.. lol  Luckily the price came back down a bit for me there
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:11:01
Yes, perfect.   The code is strong, so this is inevitable.
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:16:47
Bitcoin and Litecoin.  The shorter confirmation times really make it a great partner for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-07-29 20:33:42
Or a "Click to Lower the Price" button
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:11:49
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:54:02
Ay they're always after me lucky charms
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:02:56
Make sure to send over those receipts before you leave today.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:05:32
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:45:02
I guess this is the point of these sort of tests.  work the bugs out.
I am impressed with how these colored coins are working so far, regardless of the slight hiccup.
Thanks again mate :)
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:53:56
What sort of busy checkout lines are you paying in? :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:11:36
dont forget to hodl some of the coins
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:12:11
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:49:56
&lt;3   Spread the love
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:20:36
Both look nice :)
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:46:00
Your comment made me laugh.  So I think it is the punch line :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:14:25
I got a lawl
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:50:04
thank you friend.
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:49:27
Bit is just a unit of BTC.  Hence you can have multiple bits of BTC or multiple bitcoins of BTC. I think OP is correct here.   But I am no expert.
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:50:14
I agree with you on many points, including the bits denomination.  Great job going with bits Breadwallet!
EDIT: apparently there is no security Pin required.  This should be changed so users have the option to assign a pin lock.  Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:04:50
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:19:54
To The Moon!
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:55:20
1057.4.900d unless this is implemented ;)
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:42:53
I know it is the right word.
@_date: 2014-06-05 02:21:20
Once I got into Bitcoin, I realized how hurt'n the banks are
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:53:33
What about people spamming recipients?   Just a thought.  
Maybe you have a plan for this already.
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:52:43
or simply, 125 bits @_date: 2014-11-03 01:52:58
Thanks for doing this mate!  no need to tip me.  Thanks though for spreading the btc love
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:29:38
"And here you go kind sir, a tip for 50 bits "
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:44:11
I just do what I know how to do :P
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:08:27
I agree.  Thanks for the tip anyways !
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:36:13
As can be seen, Web Of Trust rates these sites as 'orange circles'  
not good....
