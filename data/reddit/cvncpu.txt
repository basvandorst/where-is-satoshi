You do elude to subverting the IRS, that is pretty gangsta.

Just FYI, you're confusing the term DoS/DDoS with Spam. They are two different things.

GOX on the cusp of greatness... well that one aged well.

Wow, sounds like you have quite a bit of reading to do. If you don't feel like researching something before coming to an opinion, than you're welcome to not use it.
@_date: 2012-04-14 01:09:25
For that kinda budget, why not [this](
@_date: 2012-12-23 02:34:46
Can you not read at all? This was 2010, his 10,000BTC was worth $41 USD, or approximately the cost of having someone order two pizzas for you online.

I'm just saying, people would care less about these break-ins if bitcoin had an FDIC type counter-part. I do concur though, the establishment of such an entity is either far off in the future, or will never happen.
As far as "security policy", that isn't really what I'm talking about. We may just be mixing definitions here, but to me a security policy is just a written document explaining procedure for a given organization. Also, I don't think this is really a dangerous thing to "release to the public", I don't get the hotwire analogy. If you've worked in NetSec at all, I would assume you know that there is no such thing as "unhackable," just like the titanic, you can build it for everything you expect, and then get sunk by the unexpected. The entire idea is to make it harder to break into, than the assets inside, unfortunately since it's pretty much pure untraceable cash in large amounts, they probably have one of the biggest targets on their back on the world wide web. Could they have been more secure? No doubt in my mind, however hindsight is 20/20, and if they spent what they needed to spend on netsec, then they'd probably be out of business.

I'm a very casual bitcoin miner, I don't mine very often, but I do use deepbit. In my limited use with them, everything has been fine, but someone with more experience might want to chime in.
I would look at what miner you're using, my HD6950 seems to do about 320MH/s.

Open source? Mind pasting that for an Audit? I don't see it on your wobsite.
@_date: 2012-12-23 02:09:24
You have a lot of [reading]( to do.
@_date: 2012-05-12 17:19:29
You obviously looked into this very deeply didn't you? That is why you know that their online wallet was the only one affected, their offline wallet is fine.
@_date: 2012-11-11 15:15:51
Seems legit.

I really don't like all these bank analogies, I really don't think they apply to this scenario. Do you call a bank dumb when someone steals 30% of their on-site reserves? No one gives a shit cus it's all insured. You absolutely, cannot secure anything 100%. I wouldn't say there isn't room for more security, but unless you setup their environment, I am just not sure how you can make such a determination.

CPU mining is not practical, and GPU mining is quickly becoming "old news" with the entry of FPGAs and other dedicated mining devices.
@_date: 2012-02-29 15:56:40
What kind of GPU do you have?
@_date: 2012-02-29 16:07:45
Hrmmm, looks like a FirePro V5700 isn't going to do more than 50MHash/s, I'm not sure it would be worth it at all to mine coins. You're probably a lot better off just buying them.
@_date: 2012-11-11 21:11:11
Well, you might want to look up the definition of [Open Source](
@_date: 2011-08-18 21:52:22
Yes, there is a huge difference in power usage. You will notice on your next power bill if you GPU mine 24/7.
@_date: 2011-08-03 17:21:22
Looks like most GPU Cloud services are using nVidia/CUDA.
@_date: 2011-08-18 14:05:18
With your Radeon you'll be hard pressed to break even.
@_date: 2011-08-03 19:02:16
With all the influences, I'd say it's a bit far fetched to place all the blame on one site.
@_date: 2011-08-03 17:25:04
Do you have any reasoning to back this up?
@_date: 2011-12-01 14:59:10
What sorta GPU? What do you pay for power?

Oh, is this not a standard PCIe video card? For a standard x86_64 PC?
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:58:03
Haha, all good! They're both pretty informative.
@_date: 2013-02-14 19:25:34
Why would I do this, rather than run a mining client under my own pool account?
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:06:03
Are you confusing Real Money with Marketplace?

You think the internet is centrailized? You think that's air you're breathing?

Nice, picked up a distro pack for .5771 BTC.

I don't want to be "that dude" but you don't exactly read about people that invest $2,300 and lose it all on wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:03:17
What are you talking about?
