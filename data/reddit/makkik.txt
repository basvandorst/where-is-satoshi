While I probably share your positive outlook about bitcoin. I would started these sentences with "can" instead of "will". I'm a little more realistic about what it can do. and I believe that it can be al of that, depending on how it progresses, and it has to play nice with the current way of thinking and banking in order for it to grow to its full potential. Gradual slow adoption is the key going forward, to bothe forward its positive development, and to make the change permanent.
The article above poses real life issues that merchants might have with bitcoin. While the regular bitcoin enthusiast will hold any bticoin he makes, other business might want to switch to fiat straight away and that's what issues they might face.
FULL DISCLOSURE: I am in no way affiliated with the site and just found it interesting and thought to share

Can we get a copy of said paper? I am a bitcoin enthusiast based in Saudi Arabia and looking to get this kind of support from people

They do have Shariah complian credit cards. and its a bit of a joke. instead in using the words "interest" and a percentage. they say there is a "fee" and it is "fixed" (fixed on your limits of course). but its all a play on minds and people and get them to the use them. another reason for low penetration is that poeple don't need it. Their day to day lives work fine with cash and ATM cards that work everywhere.

I know of personally the attempts of many shura council members to either unpeg the riyal from the dollar or at least revisit the peg amount because of the drag down the dollar makes. A report i heard mentioned during a conversation said that were it not pegged, saudi economy is boomly oh so slowly and would now be at around 2$ down from the pegged 3.75. but of course once presented to the king and his council its rejected

Mainly there are people in the UAE who are moving forward. apart from that fleeting interest within a few individuals.

If we are in fantasy land then every central bank should do that. but i doubt it would happen. Imagine having to explain to the ministry of finance officials (Rich dinosaurs) to spend that much

I think its just an attempt to keep the up price momentum going. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 10:38:08
all of that is done in cash. and those who you buy from are usually far removed from any type of technology

Hello Saudi National and Resident here,
Afraid there are no quick ways to buy bitcoins here. Several people are working on getting an ATM here. but nothing yet. Local bitcoins is your only option for now. No myllecium traders either. Might change when you are here though. Join the bitcoin interest group for Saudi.

Already keeping Bruce in and everything I Do.  I've made contact with the Jodran Meet up group and the UAE and are working together to have a collaberation and a partnership that ensures we are doing something good. Reddit is not used at all over here, hence my resorting to a facebook group to do most of the communication.   Traction will be slow but it is coming. and i want to be a beneficiary when it does pick up.

I can't help but think there must be a way that is more efficient than sending someone to your office and selecting data to show them. There should be a way that everyone can check a public wallet or something similar (although we all saw how MK used that to prove solvency). But this provides a start. Manual checks until someone comes up with the technology needed to not do it manually
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:00:13
Although I can't help but think there must be a more efficient way to audit that the public can access at point point in time, without the need for someone to travel to your location, and go through your data.

I have the Same 1.6 Mh/s and I have found that ltc rabbit's x11 darkcoin to LTC is the most proftable for such a small hashign rate.

While i wish it were so, that's not going to happen.The Saudi Arabian Riyal (SAR)is pegged to the dollar with the backing of the Saudi Central bank, and they have proven several times that they can stand by this pegging. also, the open ended agreement for supply of oil is based on the dollar. Even as they stop relying fully on the Americans, there are plenty of other countries they have oil dealings with that they use the Dollar with, because of the pegging.
So ya, I wish it wouldn't. But the dollar is here to stay for both short and medium term

I don't know how legislation works. If this eventually goes through, will it be a requirement for all states or just NY based businesses? or businesses who have customers in NY?

A refreshing move from the naive optismism that every user/adopter is tooting. What all his talk makes clear, is that in order for it work, a self sustaining model for mining/developing has to be found out. As it stands, EVERYBODY is volunteering, whether hashing power or spare time and code. It's not sustainable to keep on making new features and hope adoption goes up and the bitcoins you already own appreciate in value. 
While I agree that Bitcoin has the POTENTIAL to disrupt the entire world. But I am not one of those who will toot it. I believe it CAN become a mainstream viable alternative to currencies for various reasons. but the right combination of traditional banking elements, and future bitcoin capability and features have to come together in a way that compliments the current standing financial systems. and for that people need to let it run its course, markets and products mature, players enter and leave the market and in the end what ever survives proves the concept.

Ok so what other options exists apart from just buying bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-09-07 09:58:47
I would like to think that Britain's responce is going to be less "made by the banks" and more "helping" but I'm not sure where it will end up going. Even though he's expressed interest in making London the bitcoin financial capital. It depends on how the banks see bitcoin (competition/future) and how much leeway they would have with the chancellor and his Bitcoin team.
Anyone have any opinions or relevant information?
@_date: 2014-09-07 13:58:33
Realistically, while interest (riba) was used in the creation of the currency. It is not being used when being used by the muslims. The act of interest (riba) is haram. and that does not extend to the things associated with it. i.e. If you have out of wedlock sex in your bed or home, does that make your bed or home haram? no!. Reusing the bed for sleep is not an issue.

Hello Shockload, 
I'm in KSA. But there already a froup on meetup.com which meet regularly in UAE. If you're looking to network, Twitter BitcoinUAE and BitcoinMENA are great groups. Book your day for the bitcoin conference in December as well
@_date: 2014-05-19 08:37:48
Bruce and I are good friends, and one of the things we're trying for is interest groups. I thought here would be a good place to start. Saudi has very little credit card penetration so many bitcoin is the answer. Remittance is also a HUGE MARKET here in Saudi. and I'm exploring how we can address that using bitcoin.
thanks all for the support
@_date: 2014-09-07 13:01:01
I had not thought of that. it unpegs their bank account from their residency. I've also got plans in motion. I'm guessing youre in Saudi. Join our facebook interest group "Bitcoiners of Arabia". I'd like to connect
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:57:51
indeed they are, even to neighboring countries. But requires infrastructure at both ends

I'd love to know about this theory, this could be something i could work with

financial emancipation is not the issue with the women. the main showstopper is that her passport is under the power of her gaurdian, and she needs his permission to use it
@_date: 2014-09-08 05:17:21
i agree, in order to make bitcoin a feasible alternative to established remittance providers. there has to be infrastructure in place at both receiving and sending countries. transfers from Saudi are actually DIRT cheap and dirt simple. 
I have future plans to address some of these issues, just not now. one thing at a time 
@_date: 2014-09-08 05:03:15
I suppose this is where different interpretation of islam (and the different sects i suppose) come into play. For me at least, everything that is haram is fine for other people (muslims or otherwise) I'm not going to dilute my "halal" money with interest (riba) to further my money. and thats enough for me. If a bank i use charge me interest, then i dont mind paying that (did that when i lived in the uk). as i am not the one benefiting from riba. and yes by using fiat we are in turn giving it power. but i should not be responsible for them and what they. I'll worry about myself and my own gods judgement of what i do. Everything else can worry about themselves.
and i know for a fact that banks here have the image of fully shariah compliant, but behind closed doors they deal with international institutions and many an interest in taken. but same as above, let them deal with their fate, i'll keep my own face clean.

Online shopping hasn't really picked up as much as it had in the west. Those those have have relied on COD as their main method. Credit cards have a very low penetration. like most things , i see potential, but no revolutions here.
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:30:38
Thank you for the ideas and the vote of confidence. I'll keep reddit posted about anything that happen/ If I manage anything. 
In general people here rely on banks to do everything for them, including the easy stuff. with little thought about fees. Which are humongous. I think the first thing I want to do is regular social meet ups and awareness. Then an educational body (is that what you meant by bitcoin MIT?) the conference is a start and it can keep people moving in the right direction. 
There is no real purposes of adopting bitcoin here. The system isn't broken and the local culture aren't the type to jump up into new opportunity. So to push them into bitcoin it has to be a smooth connection with the tried and tested traditional banking. or at least be seen as an evolution of their more traditional banking needs.
fingers crossed we can explore and find a way to make that bridge
