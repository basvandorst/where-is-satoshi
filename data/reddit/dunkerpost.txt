Like I said before it doesn't matter what people believe. If you can't actually spend or withdraw them it has no impact on overall demand.

The value isn't based on perceived supply it's on actual supply. Since the actual supply is the same there isn't a rational reason for the price to change.

I agree with you that value is subjective but I disagree that price is based on perceived supply. I made the mistake of interchanging value and price.
Imagine you walk into a town that you've never been to before and want to purchase a pen. You walk into the first store you see. The price of this pen has a lot to do with how many other stores in the town are selling the pen (supply). I have no idea how many other stores are selling this pen so I don't know what the perceived supply is but all that actually matters is what the actual supply is. If the price is too high at this store then most people would go to the other stores in the town. If it was too low then the store would be losing out on profit. 
If I went to a different store that was advertising pens for very cheap and they told me they didn't actually have pens (gox) then this doesn't affect the price because they can't be sold and I am still going to go to one of the other stores to buy my pen.

It's "ripping you off" just as much as the Ferrari dealership is ripping you off. If you think something is too expensive don't buy it.

Are you just contradicting your last statement? Yes anyone can walk into a bank and open an account and get a debit card. OP can do this. OP cannot get a credit card.

Either cars are really expensive in china or you got ripped off.

If it was stolen it obviously wasn't in the wallet it was stolen from. It may have displayed as if it was there but it had no actual purchase power.

There is the exact same amount of Bitcoin bought as there is bitcoin sold.

if it wasn't linked to the exchange rate then the landlord would hope the price of bitcoin goes up. If they bought a put option against BTC they would hope it goes down.

Everything that you know about what the Federal Reserve plans to do has already been priced into the market by people who make a living doing this stuff. I don't think that is a good reason to risk everything by putting all of your eggs in one basket, especially if you're turning down free money in the process.

and this makes it all the more confusing

The denomination shouldn't have much to do with the volatility. If 1USD=8CNY then the price moving 1USD should correspond to the price moving approximately 8CNY. Since volatility is in terms of % the volatility should should be very similar.
