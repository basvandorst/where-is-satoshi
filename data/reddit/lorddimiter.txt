And now their "support comes here and start excusing themselves for their behaviour" . Explain me this : How come when a client deposits their money with you, you do it in an instant, and then when the client wants to withdraw, you start suddenly having ungodly demands about their identity?
If you want to KYC , then do it thoroughly before accepting their money. Hypocrites..

I would say that crypto currency will reach critical mass when they start being used for their utility and not for the speculative factor. Gaming is a good proponent of such effect

Research platforms like blockfi and nexo, both allow you to put your crypto as a collateral to get usd. It is actually the best possible scenario for a hodler that needs to cash out to meet expenses. If Bitcoin goes up, you still gain the full value of appreciation of your collateralized bitcoin.

Euro was forced by gov's. Bitcoin is trying to establish itself as the money of the internet. Decentralized systems are slower at the beginning, but scale much better once they hit critical mass. (Think wikipedia vs some library)
