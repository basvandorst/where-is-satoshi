A lot of sites tend to do their calculation based on 10 minute blocks. This is an easy way to calculate but isn't very accurate.
Our counter is calculated by using an average of the blocktime over the past 24 hours.
This provides more fluctuations but more accuracy. We feel that 24hours is a bit short though and we may increase this time to be a moving average of 5 days

Thank you very much for your feedback �� we will consider this when adjusting our timers calculation

Hi - We updated our calculation using a dampener towards the 10-minute average to reduce sensitivity based on your suggestion :) Thank you!

Alternative countdown:
How is our timer calculated?
You may notice our countdown has a different estimation than other bitcoin halving countdowns and ask "Why?"
We believe this makes our countdown more accurate because instead of using the commonly quoted average block time (10 minutes), we are using live blockchain statistics and obtaining an estimation of the current average block time, then conducting our calculation based on that. Our timer may fluctuate, however, we believe it is the most accurate block halvening clock.
The Bitcoin Halvening timer on Binance Academy is calculated using the following formula:
(Halving block - Next block height) * Average time between blocks - estimated time until the next block. We then apply a weighting toward the 10:00 average block time to reduce the sensitivity to abnormal hash rate movements

A lot of clients use 6 confirmations as a sign of improbability of being modified on the bitcoin blockchain.
The bitcoin whitepaper itself states 
"only 6 blocks or 1 hour is enough to make reversal computationally impractical."

Hey OP - You can learn about Hyperinflation on Binance Academy. Suggest giving it a read so you can understand why it may not be a good thing

We also have 231 on our counter. 
I'm not sure the op's counter is accurate because it's just: x blocks * 10 minutes
