the transaction going down because its weekend.. every weekend is like that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:01:27
because bitcoin has more people invested that keep shilling for it like a Ponzi or MLM scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:44:41


but they could pretty much break it with a 51% attack. Theoretically.


ultimately - yes its controlled by the government even though they don't have a direct influence on monetary policies. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:56:50
as for now, bitcoin is almost solely based on money from investors with almost zero use as currency... making it basically a Ponzi scheme...
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:47:05


and the thing is that bitcoin is not used much outside of HODL AND GET RICH. People believe in the USD because they can go out right now and buy anything everywhere in the US while (in most cases) you can only buy dollars with bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:54:19
There are only a few places where you can buy stuff directly with bitcoin and none of them is pricing their goods in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:42:54
this video so wrong. 
Makes me wonder about this sub... how can so many people always fall for these conspiracies and lies? 
this is worrying
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:41
their sub looks like pre mtgox crash panic. I think it started with validation and identification issues as well.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:22:20
bitcoin being a store of value and nothing else won't work out. Only being backed by speculating investors  is a recipe for disaster...
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:59:10


maybe, but the communist regime of China will the last one who would allow giving away their power over their money.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:17:54


it's people investing in bitcoin and transferring it on exchanges. No real business accepts bitcoin without bitpay and bitpay has only like 0.25% of paypals usage. Probably even way lower than that and paypal still grows faster in total numbers by magnitudes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:25:17


is it really happening? looks like more shops abandoning bitcoin again.
Most merchants are using bitpay and they have only like 0.23% of paypals transaction volume. That's nothing... after 8 years of bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:06:25
bitcoin sucks as currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:22
bitcoin is not the tech - its blockchains. Your analogy would work much better with AOL instead of the internet...
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:24:03
this place was always full of people astroturfing bitcoin. Nothing new.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:29:45
maybe preventing money laundering, tax evasion, fraud or just simply keep the economy intact since an economy solely run on a deflationary currency without any control mechanism would be [devastating](
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:58
it's most likely a huge bubble. Bitcoin is losing its utility and is only backed by speculative investor money instead of actual real demand from people who actually want to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:36:36


it's how it usually works without conspiracies


any source i can read up on how a 51% attack is debunked / impossible?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:18:13


maybe as a cleaner.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:45
pretty much but its still speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:16:26


why should it be incorrect? it's still the same argument as in op's article.
It's certainly possible to compromise the bitcoin network with the majority hash rate and china has it. Why would someone do anything like this? i' don't know but I also don't know why PayPal ban anyone's bank account. I don't think China cares much about profits and they would use it as a weapon in case of a conflict.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:31:08
stop comparing bitcoin to the internet in that analogy. It's like saying AOL was the internet...
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:48:16
well, they could easily prevent any shop from offering it as a payment option and they could go after exchanges.
Would at least prevent any kind of mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:56:51
wow someone listed that they accept crypto for a private car sale?
that's news worthy?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:41:07

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:49:12
are these coins still being tracked?

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:29:55


AOL is still alive aswell.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:47:27
he means that exchanges basically faking transactions to make it look more volatile and manipulate the prices that way.


@_date: 2017-12-04 17:04:11
no its not right.
the first minute about that it is impossible to ever pay back the interest on the fed.
That's not how it works. The interest a central bank earns goes back to the government. (that's why it is usually not allowed that a government can borrow money directly form a central bank.)
[Here a diagram.]( It's a zero-sum game.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:09:38
Myspace was the number 1 social network as well. Bitcoin has also almost no adoption as a payment processor or currency... so there is enough room for an altcoin to rise up. The hash power could switch overnight or maybe not even needed anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:48:28
idk, most of this stuff turns out to be pure fake news if you dig deeper.
Like "subways accepts bitcoin" they never did except one store owner or news about XY is accepting bitcoin then if you look it up it turns out they only take bitcoin through services like bitpay and never actually touch bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:03:59
since bitcoin just wants to be a store of value and not a currency or a tool to settle payments it could be considered as Ponzi since the only demand comes from only from investors (very volatile). An investment that can only stay afloat as long new investors can be acquired? sounds like a Ponzi scheme for me....
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:11


Metcalfe's law also applies to social networks. Yet, Facebook managed it to get a larger user base than myspace because they focused on certain userbase (college students) and had a overall better website.
Bitcoin, as it is right now, has a horrible acceptance under Merchants. Almost no real business is accepting bitcoin without services like bitpay and bitpay has like 0.22% of PayPal's transaction volume... so there is room enough for another coin who could deliver a faster and cheaper p2p payment solution that will be used by the majority.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:27:59
wow... that's really sad.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:46:35
in a deflation, the minimum wage would have to be decreased. whats your point?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:20:50
bitcoin as a deflationary currency will actually hurt poor people more and increases the wealth gap.
edit: wow... getting downvoted by economic illiterate people...
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:45:09
yeah true, but that should basically work with bitcoin ATMs aswell.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:57:51
because bitcoin is a speculative asset and probably is in a bubble.
It could ruin a lot of existences.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:56:55


i know that. But that's all? Can the utility only be found in a rare conspiracy theory-ridden case? You claimed its utility is that you can walk across the border and still have access to your money but this is the normal case with every other substitute.
and you still need to trust someone at least on local bitcoins or exchanges to turn your bitcoins into cash that you can use...


then you understood wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:20
Bitcoin won't give you consulting about investments
Bitcoin won't invest money
Bitcoin won't bring buyers and sellers together in a regulated environment.
Bitcoin won't lend you money
Bitcoin won't give you support for anything
Bitcoin won't resolve any disputes for you
Bitcoin won't be a physical object by itself (like bank notes)
Most Online banks are basically just a website and APIs talking to each other. There are many people behind and they can handle far more transactions per second than bitcoin. 
It's not like bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency won't need a huge infrastructure and regulations to be used by the masses. Just think about how many people have lost their wallets or forgot their passwords... most want this to be handled by 3rd parties like banks.
I mean I still can write a transfer voucher to my bank and they will do the transaction for me (for all the people who still can't handle online banking).
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:37
its all speculation at this point. LN won't scale bitcoin as much as people are promoting here... 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:29:39
evading taxes while everyone else has to pay them is theft aswell.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:26:24
market cap != total value. 
I think you are also comparing circulating money to bitcoins that would mostly be in short-term deposits on exchanges and a lot of bitcoins are lost forever.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:14:31
electricity costs aren't intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:22:42
adoption would be to actually use bitcoin by purchasing something with it and not just investing lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:21
are bitcoin transactions now compared to 747 jets? lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:38:46
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:12:53
slow transaction speed and rising costs per transaction are a huge issue in bitcoin. Will they fix it before some altcoin takes over? I don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:19:43


thank you digging out a source


no one is talking about miners agreeing to pull something off that could make them profit. The article and i is talking about the PLA showing up on mining businesses doors and carry out a large-scale 51% attack for political reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:57:59


i agree, noone is using bitcoin as a currency or to buy things. How is this sustainable? its not... i made a thread about that topic but it got burried.
Without any usage as some kind of currency, there is no real demand outside of investments and most people will argue that this is okay because "Bitcoin doesn't need to be used to buy products - it's like digital gold."
but isn't this a recipe for disaster? investment demand can change overnight and is very volatile compared to a steady and predictable demand of bitcoins to buy everyday things.
**But what about gold?**: Gold still has a significant noninvestment-related demand (&gt;50%) and has been established as a store of value throughout the human history. All other precious metals only have a &lt;10% investment-related demand and everything has other usages than just being a number in a blockchain. That's a huge difference.
how can this work out? in the end, it just depends on if there are enough new investors to keep bitcoin afloat and that sounds more like a Ponzi scheme than a sustainable investment that people use to store their wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:32:50
Bitcoin =! blockchain, internet, electricity and so on.
stop with these bs analogies 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:27


well, the total projected transaction volume for bitpay is like 1 bn this year (probably lower). That's like 0.23% of paypals transaction volume and most of bitpays payments are high sum b2b.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:30:03
but cryptos are making this pretty easy and some of them are specially designed to be used anonymous
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:37:18
hard to hack an exchange and wire out the money... that's not possible.
That's a major point in this article: Drawing a false comparison between dissimilar things.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:03:26
all these conspiracy theories...
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:54:08


but the haspower can vanish from one second to another. Actually happend when Bcahs still had EDA.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:42:11
this is drawing a false comparison between dissimilar things.  Banks do much more than just making a transaction from a to b. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:40:39
Metcalfe's Law would only be relevant if bitcoin would actually be used...
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:51:39


And censoring an individual’s transaction(s) may be too expensive to keep up because they risk damaging their reward terribly
but this based again on the premise that someone wants to make a profit with such an attack. The Chinese government would just want to make bitcoin worthless to weaken the west.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:55:18
nice arguments
go read a book please
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:16


it's pretty weak and not reflecting the current hype. Bitcoins market share is not just tiny compared to another payment processor -  it's also growing much slower in total numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:09:06
but bitcoin only wants to money information from a to b and using an absurd amount of energy while only doing like 0.001% of all transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:29:52


Doubtful without any real demand from people used to purchase goods. People can change their mind about bitcoins capabilities as a store of value overnight making it prone to speculation causing it being always a volatile investment. 
Also, don't kid yourself... Bitcoin right now is no way a store of value with these kinds of fluctuations and still very uncertain future... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:15:39
adoption of what? certainly not bitcoin as a payment processor/currency.
Is people HODL thinking that they will get rich really adoption? don't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:08:28
bitcoin in its current iteration is pretty bad as a medium of exchange. I don't think it will hold long as a store of value if demand comes from other investors only.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:32:47
the blockchain tech has a future but bitcoin itself has too many shortcomings, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:40:50
what are refunds
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:41:34
demand from South Korea. People speculating there or they think that there will be are a war at some point. Or the exchanges are just painting the tab and other market manipulations are going on.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:49
and what has this to do with anything i wrote? at least write the whole story and not just try to astroturf bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:17:45
the usage of gold in jewelry and industry is still around 50%. Prices will fall and miner will go out of business until it hits a new equilibrium.

That so many bitcoins fall for this makes me really questioning bitcoin itself and its actual value.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:55:18


adoption isn't measured by how much investor money you can rise... Either it gets used outside of the get rich meme or not.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:30:11


who do you think has to borrow money? not the 1%...


who do you think gets laid off because of the decreasing demand? not the 1%...
it actually would help the lazy one since doing nothing at all with your money would be a valid investment option.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:06:16


yeah, I tried to say that these are all isolated cases or poor countries just don't bring enough investment volume to make a big difference.


true, but don't have hard feelings if the store of value approach doesn't work out in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:01:21
no, it's not. No product's adoption is ever measured in how many new investors it could acquire.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:08:55
I'm really annoyed by all the people trying to sell bitcoin as a sure thing to all the newbies with patterns only found in MLM and Ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:30:47


highly unlikely. It has massive scaling problems and no government will give away their monopoly on money because it could be devastating to the economy and society in general.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:40:32
because it is a Ponzi scheme if it can only stay afloat only as long as new investors can be acquired.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:35
it's about the mania itself...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:54:39

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:56:30


yes, as long as it doesn't have any significant adoption as a currency or payment processor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:09:36


a user has to use the product. HODL is not using bitcoin - it's speculating that bitcoin will increase in its worth. Purchasing good and services is using bitcoin but most who come into bitcoin NEVER intend to buy anything ever with it.

this tax is a crime nonsense ... It was democratically agreed to run the society that way and you earned your taxable income with the help,  infrastructure, and security it has provided to you.
If you don't like taxes then vote someone in office that will remove them instead of screwing over all other people who pay their fair share.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:02:52


not saying crypto will replace our fiat money. But it could be a nice way to do online shopping without any fees. Or a new way to doing global transactions.


well, okay, there are use cases but most demand comes from the West where people have the money. If shits hit the fan that people need to flee a country like Japan or France then our whole world order as we know has been collapsed and you probably would be better off with gold.


also that the next thing. In case some major country like the US goes after bitcoin, what kind of store of value would it be then? I know that they cant completly shut it down but still... you could not be able to ever cash in your bitcoins because no acess to exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:12:19

it's called exchanges which are mostly run by banks. 


tell this to all the people who got scammed and had no way to fight back.


There is also no need for fiat money to be physical... but yet it is because a lot people still want to use the physical form.
the rest of your post is not really on topic... 
as for now, bitcoin does NOTHING besides transacting value from a to b. A single Mysql server could do millions of transaction / s while bitcoin can only do like 4 right now while consuming as much power as Ireland.

that is not a radical statement
Miners will mine whatever gives them the most of their hash power. The amount of hash power correlates a lot with the price of a coin. 
Also, like 70% of all bitcoin miners are located in China... that's not really secure or decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:56:32
hard to tell how many people have invested in bitcoin.
The % usage of bitcoin as a payment instrument is very very very tiny. Most real businisses only accept bitcoin through bitpay.
Bitpay projected a billion transaction volume for bitcoin in 2017.
For comparison, paypal will have a transaction volume of 440 billion $
so bitcoin/bitpay has only around 0.22% of paypals usage.

the lightning network won't solve the scaling problem. All it does is allowing CERTAIN use cases that can be handled off the chain.
Have you ever looked into the dark web reddits or directly into the dark web marketplaces? Altcoins gaining popularity fast. Why even use an off chain solution if it is theoretically possible to create a next-generation coin that can handle it on-chain? In the end -  the better tech will win. If the network effect such a deciding factor then we wouldnt be talking about crypto at all because of the huge userbase fiat money has...

begging for bitcoin? really?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:21:09
as for now, they need to find an exchange where they can cash out their bitcoin to buy anything.
Also, i still can cross a border and just use a credit card... or get money from my normal bank account from an ATM... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:23:53
yeah, fuck the environment, who needs that shit anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:59:24
Think about it this way. Assume that you have to store your wealth in a crypto protocol for 10 years without being able to touch it until then.
The rational choice would be to pick the coin that has the highest likelihood of surviving attacks to its integrity over such a long period. This translates to picking the coin which is (a) the most decentralised and has (b) the smallest possible attack surface.
Tokens that offer very rapid transactions on chain (e.g. Dash, Litecoin) are highly prone to being centralised. This isn't bad if you are just using them to pay for small ticket items, but it's a big risk if you want to be reassured about their resiliency against centralisation attacks. This means that they are worse than Bitcoin for condition (a).
if bitcoin doesn't get used as currency/payment tool then there is no natural demand keeping the price stable (i want to STORE my wealth and not speculate). The store of value, in this case, is highly questionable anyways since the since the price will solely depend if there are new investors or not. (inb4 gold... no [gold also has quite a lot natural demand]( besides being a store of value for centuries).
i mean... solely depending on new investors to keep the thing afloat is a recipe for disaster and no wonder why people keep calling it Ponzi scheme...


I don't. I think cryptocurrencies aren't generally not made for being a store of value. Like said above... its highly questionable and the current surge in price is solely built on the belief that bitcoin will be the next Paypal or even a complete currency.

did sending an email also cost like 8$ in fees back then?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:39:58
nice argument you got there ...
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:40:22
well, deflation is always bad for getting people spending money and probably will never offer stable prices.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:56:05
this brings buttcoin to a new level.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:38:15


because it gets used in the industry? you cant make jewelry out of bitcoin or use it in some products. [see chart.](


all of these have other usages besides being just a number in a blockchain. Diamonds and other rare metals have an investment demand of like 5-10% of the total demand.


that is maybe true. But yet there is still a significant amount of natural demand. Gold was established as a store of value over centuries. If you go to a Vietnamese farmer and show him a gold bar - he would know its worth something... try that with bitcoin.


it's not like the market can change its opinion about bitcoin. In the end its all about marketing... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:15:16
because satoshi vanished and probably is dead by now. The coins in his wallet never moved since the first day of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:08:32
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:02:52


ofc because no one of the miners wants to break bitcoin. It's actually addressed in the article in op's article.


[but is not so split if you look at it as Chinese vs non-Chinese miners]( 


and who do you think can appoint the head of a central bank?
who do you think makes the laws the central bank operates on?
who can change the underlying laws?
exactly. the government.

it's mostly driven by investors and the HODL meme. Bitcoin adoption under merchants and consumers is pretty bad so I'm not sure it will be sustainable for much longer.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:03:28


That's the whole point. Peoples investment in bitcoin gain value by acquiring new investors that buy in and hold (increasing demand / decreasing supply). So people run around and astroturfing bitcoin across the web and convince all their friends and family to join the scheme which is very similar to how people act when they are part of a Ponzi or MLM scheme... Even the Lambo meme is stolen from decade-old MLM schemes...
I would not complain if people would at least promote Bitcoin as a product they should use... instead, bitcoin gets promoted as an investment and people especially told NOT to use it (HODL) as a get rich quick scheme.
It's not bitcoin that gets sold - its the concept of getting rich quick that gets sold to people like MLMs and ponzis do since forever...
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:22:35
i don't know but i can see that the merchant and consumer adoption for bitcoin as a payment tool is horrible.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:08:38
it's stunning how bitcoin is rising 10X in a year while the merchant and consumer acceptance is stagnating or even going backward.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:23:29


i don't understand. Stores won't use any "illegal payment options" since they have to promote them and can easily be busted.


they can't stop it but can make it unattractive to use cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:54:08
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:03


there is no doubt about that the bitcoin community has turned into some kind of cult similar to MLM and ponzie schemes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:11:27


again, what has this to do with you telling only half the story?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:13:42


Do you see where I'm going with this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:55


bitcoin has a bad adoption as a currency or payment processor. Enough room for alts to surpass bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:33:49


no one could stop an undisclosed bank account as well.


there is almost no shop directly accepting bitcoins especially since the fees rose so much. That's has nothing to do with convenience or utility... people even survived without any form of money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:52:03
right? yesterday people posted the exact same article from 5 different "bitcoin blogs".
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:10:18
idk how any business can convert a sale in bitcoin with these insane fees and value increase.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:52
without bitpay there would almost no real business where you can buy stuff with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:36:00


and yet there are 1.5k different coins out there trying to do similar things. Is there anything on the tech side that bitcoin does but no other coin can do? ...
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:17:34
pretty low
would be more likely that the Chinese government will take them over some day.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:29:12
you could maybe try an altcoin. One of them could be the next new thing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:10:52
then its defacto a decrease in the minimum wage. I assume the legislators are well aware of the concept of inflation and deflation. Most countries rise it with inflation other don't and they would decrease it every year if there is a deflation.
minmum wage has nothing to do with deflation / inflation.
