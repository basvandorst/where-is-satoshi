Also if you don't have access to Google Play store on the device, you might just be able to download the app from say  'Write com.bips.pos' and install it over USB using "adb install com.bips.pos.apk" That would allow for very cheap devices without say App Store to function well as Point of Sale devices.

I'm alittle afraid that it might be possible to embed the magic string in the blockchain by sending bitcoin dust payments or similar. Hence maybe allowing arbitrary code execution on all systems with vulnerable bash and bitcoind installed.

To be honest, I think the easiest way is to simply move the Master boot record to the USB drive, and make the USB stick the first boot option in BIOS. Then it doesn't even matter what operation system you are using.

This will work on most devices,   It will scale down as far as 320x240 in resolution. So should display nice on whatever device you might trow at it.
Here is an example you can play around with in your browser,  It will always scroll down to the QR code, whenever you generate a new invoice, or turn the device sideways.
Also if you don't have access to Google Play store on the device, Say a very cheap android device ? you might just be able to download the app from say  'Write com.bips.pos' and install it over USB using "adb install com.bips.pos.apk" That would allow for very cheap devices without say App Store to function well as Point of Sale devices.

Hi, Kris from BIPS here. I'll just like to add, this is borderline insanity. Maybe we should put more focus on [Chirp'ing Bitcoin]( ?

See if  works for you. It does however require some KYC and that you setup your account with forwarding bitcoin address, and generate the API key.
You also have a WebSocket hook for completed payment notification, and it will send callback's to your URL with the custom variables you define.

You could compile and build the bitcoin daemon with the 0.9.1 feature --disable-wallet. This should save on some CPU cycles, and many hard drive writes.

There is the possibility of acquiring bitcoins through  using your already established and verified BIPS merchant account credentials and bank account. However it will not be instant bitcoin purchase, but via bank transfers. So except delay of how long it might take your bank to wire the fiat money to their bank.
