Where’s the guy who was throwing shade at me when I said SIPC protection is a big deal and a decided advantage of holding a gold ETF over Bitcoin?

What steps did I list for crypto?  All I said was that getting a bank account is easy—under 10 minutes and online—and getting money into and out of it are easy.   So what is the advantage of Bitcoin in this equation?  Oh, I can send money to Iran.  Well just close the Federal Reserve right now.

That’s how I felt when I was asked how to send money to Iran. Why would I ever send money to Iran?

Um any number of ways:
You can set up direct deposit with your employer.    
You can transfer from another account via ACH.     
You can get a check and mail it to them.     
You can get a check and take a picture of it and mobile deposit it.     
You can take cash, check, or money order and walk into a branch and deposit it.     
You can take cash, buy a money order or ask someone to write you a check and mobile deposit it.    
You can be sent money via PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, Square Cash, etc. etc.     
If it’s an account like Serve or Bluebird you can walk into Walmart/CVS/Dollar General and load cash at the register.     
You can wire money.

How do you send bitcoin to your pen pal in North Korea?
Please get over yourself. Bitcoin has its uses but this isn’t one of them.

You asked how do you get money in the account.  I gave you a list of about 10 ways to get money into the account.  You can set up a brick and mortar account online, not just online only banks. Citi, Chase, Wells Fargo, Santander, etc. etc. etc. all let you open up accounts online without you having to speak to anyone.
What rigmarole?  There are 4 ways you can receive or send money money, cash, check, ACH, or wire.  That’s it.  All 4 can be done with a regular ol’ bank account.  Cash is literally the only one that requires you to get off your butt and do something to deposit it, but honestly, we’re moving towards being a cashless society so I don’t view that as a big deal anyway.  I probably spend less than $250/yr in actual physical cash.
You act like having a bank account is a big barrier.  I don’t know if you live in Zimbabwe or something, but in the United States getting a bank account is easy—especially if you haven’t screwed the banks over.  If you’re a person who overdrafts your accounts and then disappears, well yeah, there’s a thing called ChexSystem which is like a credit score for bank accounts.  You’ll be blacklisted.  But for a normal responsible person, a bank account is kind of a prerequisite for life.

Am I the only one who laughs when Bitcoin speculators say it’s going to be worth $1,000,000 and then when you say why they say it’s because “Fiat is worthless and will lose 99% of its value!”?

How do you send Bitcoin to someone in Iran who doesn’t own a computer/smartphone/know how to read?  
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:19:08
I wasn’t predicting anything. I was just point out the irony of saying in 1 breathe  Bitcoin is going to be worth $1,000,000 and in another breathe dollars are going to be worthless.

You can open an interest bearing bank account online in a few minutes. You can send money via Venmo, square cash, or Zelle practically instantaneously. All with no fees. What is this post talking about?

You can buy the ETF GLD. ..
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:34:58
If you are comparing the investability of GLD to Bitcoin it’s the exact same thing. Actually GLD is far superior to Bitcoin as it will have SIPC protection.  
If you are holding Bitcoin as a hedge against the “collapse” I got news for you, it too will be worthless if the monetary system disintegrates and we return to the dark ages.

Do you see why this isn’t a good comparison?  The internet is a general concept—network of networks.  It’s like saying “sports” — competitive athletics.  Bitcoin is a particular application.  If Bitcoin wins it will be like the NFL or MLB.  If it does okay it will be like the ABA—getting absorb by a similar competitor.  If it fails it will be like the USFL.
