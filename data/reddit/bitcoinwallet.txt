Hmm, either the screenshot is fake or the imposter duplicated more apps. The Bitcoin Wallet app – contrary to what the screenshot shows – is not available for iOS, only Android and BlackBerry.

Why don't you simply backup the wallet on your phone? If you protect it with a safe password you can archive the backup to the cloud and you should be safe.

Spongycastle is an identical repackage of Bouncycastle, except in a different Java package. This is because Android ships with its own incomplete Bouncycastle version.

Lots of wallets are better than bc.i. I suggest a decentralized wallet:
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry OS)
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:46:51
It's most likely a wallet backup of [Bitcoin Wallet]( the most popular mobile wallet.
Copy the file to /sdcard/Download/ and use Options &gt; Safety &gt; Restore wallet. You'll need your backup password though.

There is a way to refund in Bitcoin since 2013; it's in the BIP70 payment protocol. Which is hopefully used by all payment providers these days.
What wallet do you use, and what payment provider did Microsoft use for your purchase?

Thanks for letting us know. Can you tell what's the best process for getting an app removed, especially for the case if you don't have any (developer) relation to Apple?

It's always a good idea to review the source codes for issues like this.
Bitcoin Wallet [has the Google backup service explicitly disabled since 2012]( It was disabled by default before that point, so no private keys have ever touched the service.

Actually a lot of legitimate Bitcoin apps look sketchy. And on the other hand, the bad guys can update the look of their apps pretty easily.

Except for the multi-platform, I'd recommend [Bitcoin Wallet]( for Android. It's as lightweight and decentralized/protocol-level-secure as you can get.
Instructions to get your funds out in worst case:

Yes it's true the DNS seeds are hardcoded and yes this is a kind of centralization. But somehow you need to bootstrap; need to know at least the IP address of one node. So there isn't really much choice, unless you hardcode the addresses of peers themselves (which I think Core does, too).
@_date: 2016-04-07 21:58:40
Well, ~5 DNS servers would need to be shut down at the same time. And it's easy to set up additional servers.

I suggest visiting a local Bitcoin meetup. There is one in each major city. You will meet people who are willing to sell small amounts to you.

If you have an Android phone, I suggest
- [Bitcoin Wallet](
for your spending money. The main reason is with Bitcoin Wallet you can pay even if your phone is offline, using the "payment protocol" via Bluetooth. When you've got Internet access, e.g. at your hotel room, you can swipe paper wallets into your Bitcoin Wallet as needed.

I would be very interested in seeing how they do the seeding, especially if it can interfere in some way with our fixes.

It's a Coinbase error. It happens with [Bitcoin Wallet]( as well. These two amounts are sometimes off by one Satoshi. I suspect at one point they use float for storing Bitcoin values and thus is loses full precision.

Afaik, you may sell stuff that is usable outside of your app. But I'm not a lawyer.

Well, the OP mentioned he needs to log in. Later, a user BitFast confirms it's a server that causes the log in problems. That's a point of centralization. It can fail, as the OP experienced.
SPV clients can connect to *any* node in the Bitcoin network.
I agree GreenAddress is not "hosted", meaning it does not know/keep your private keys. That's a good thing.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:24:13
At least they put the ones with BIP70 support at the top.

Why don't you use a [decentralized]( [wallet](
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:08:52

[Bitcoin Wallet]( has a format for transmitting transactions via QR code already – it was implemented back in 2011! It's mainly meant for getting a transaction to the merchant if all other methods fail (P2P network, NFC, Bluetooth), but of course it would be easy to use it for unsiigned txns as well.
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:01:51
You can use mobile wallets like [Bitcoin Wallet]( to swipe your paper wallet into your wallet when you need it.
Whatever you do, you should generally stay away from centralized services. And bc.i in particular, looking at their repeated fuckups with handling randomness.
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:07:50
You can add either a BIP21 link to the email text or a BIP70 payment request message to the attachments. It's both supported by [Bitcoin Wallet](

In case anyone is interested, we've been alpha-testing Bitcoin Wallet 4.0 for a while and now there is a release candidate. v4.0 uses bitcoinj 0.12 and makes use of deterministically derived addresses. Please help testing:
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:59:59
Scanning QR codes, tapping via NFC and clicking URI links in web pages are the most secure, because it's difficult to man-in-the-middle those. What's wrong with them in your opinion?
Bluetooth and Chirp are too long-range for initiating payments. It's easy to MITM.
Copy+Paste ist extremly dangerous because other apps can access and rewrite the clipboad without any special permissions/privileges.

@_date: 2014-12-12 17:02:46
Wait a minute -- so in order to enable security, I need 3 devices?
- the potentially compromised device running the wallet to secure
- the ledge USB key
- a smartphone paired to the USB key
That sounds cumbersome. And since the paired smartphone may not be compromised, why not just use the smartphone for signing? Same security.
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:17:51
You can use any Bitcoin wallet to accept Bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2014-09-02 22:08:52
Thanks for answering! That's exactly the usecase the payment protocol was invented for and [Bitcoin Wallet]( has implemented this with NFC plus Bluetooth since 2011. Have a look at [BIP70]( and [this document]( about the possibilities of Bitcoin Wallet.
With your system, I guess the user needs to keep the devices in touch during the whole process? How will they be able to read the request they're going to confirm?
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:46:20
Don't import the private key anywhere. Use wallet-tool to send your coins from that key to the wallet of your choice. After that, never use the private keys again.
It's all described in this document:
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:47:45
If you want to go the decentralized way, try [bitcoin-integration-android]( It's compatible to almost all wallets on Android.
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:58:38
You could have used it for Bitcoin payments for example.
@_date: 2015-12-03 16:31:14
You giveaway is a good idea! Most wallets will require 1 confirmation for sending, for good reason (transaction malleability being one of them).
I suggest recommending truly decentralized wallets:
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry) or
- [Breadwallet]( (iOS).
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:42:26
How is this different to what Bitcoin Wallet has implemented since years?
From what I understand from their website: you pay by tapping two phones together. That's nothing new afaict. And it doesn't require a special brand phone or a special version of Android. Any NFC chip will do.
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:45:51
So far, bitcoinj only has a hdw-alpha branch. That's far from being released! At some some point, it will go into bitcoinj 0.12.
If you want to use HD wallets now, you can build Bitcoin Wallet yourself from the bitcoinj-0.12 branch. Please report testing results back to us.
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:23:00
Indeed. What software have you been using by the way? These days no decent wallet should allow sending coins without fee, at least not without a warning message.
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:51:01
A mandatory app just for this shopping mile. Strange concept.
But otherwise, nice to hear more shops adopt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-04 10:18:49
BIP44 requires supporting accounts, but for simplicity Bitcoin Wallet has decided against that already some time ago.

We're talking about "Grandma easy".
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:08:59
Well, that's not "just a public address". It's the address you pay to. If you think it's not important, I suggest from now on you always pay to my address instead the payee. (-:
In short: It's highly sensitive, just a little bit less sensitive than private keys.

Bluetooth is very quick, even without LE. I'd say &lt;500ms for a connect, transmit a standard transaction and disconnect. The actual transaction signing is slower, if you do it on a phone.
I can't think of a reason why you wouldn't use Bluetooth. All phones sold in the past 5 years have it, and it's easy to use. No need for an awkward double tap!
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:47:59
Warning: Do not import private keys! You never know who is in possession of them, besides you. Especially in the case of blockchain.info, who had trouble with security several times.
Instead, sweep private keys into your wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-23 17:31:00
Sounds reasonable. Are there any rules on how menu items should be capitalized? To be honest I never read anything about that in all the Android guides.
@_date: 2014-07-05 08:11:34
Yes, if you link that into your app you need to license your app under GPLv2/v3 as well.
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:36:57
It's perhaps not widely known, but BIP32 defines not only the derivation functions, but also a wallet hierarchy. When bitcoinj started to implement BIP32 almost a year ago -- long before BIPs 43/44 -- the minimum of that structure was implemented. In the spec this is referred to by "default account".
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:24:00
Actually, the "proposed" Bluetooth feature is already implemented since a few months:
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:34:25
I just added a warning for those who are not aware that just keeping the backup on your phone is not enough in some cases. Will go into the next version of the app.
@_date: 2014-10-04 10:17:35
HD stands for hierarchical deterministic. Bitcoin addresses are deterministically derived from one secret seed value.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:34:24
Bitcoin-qt is still a good choice, but for most people it's too resource intensive and it takes too long to sync the block chain.

You don't need a payment provider to accept Bitcoin payments. Just use a Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:50:00
Well, different approaches actually do hurt if your goal is compatibility between clients.
That said, I'm wondering what's the advantage of their approach? They say they have a bi-directional channel, but what are they using that for? For transmitting a payment request you only need one direction.
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:48:52
Why not install Bitcoin Wallet for BlackBerry? Just search for "Bitcoin" on BlackBerry World.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:55:19
No, its not impossible. In fact, it would be fairly easy. Which is why if you don't trust the binaries signed with my release key please build your own APK and use that.
We could work on a reproducable build infrastructure. This would allow multiple individuals to build and compare their build against the build signed by me. Ideally they would sign as well, slowly building a network of trust.
Bitcoin Core has something like this (called Gitian), but its very unweildy. For Android, it should be easier.
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:19:15
Why do you think that? That's not how MITM attacks generally work.

On Android, you have sandboxing. So you can't access other processes memory.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:40:33
Have a look at in-app Bitcoin payments:
It will work with almost any Bitcoin Wallet that's installed on your phone!
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:47:28
That's actually old stuff. Since some years there are porn sites that require you to solve a captcha for each pic. The solved captchas are sold to scripts, or rather the people operating them.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:58:56
The current (slightly changed) plan is the the "Your addresses" tab in the address book will stay for now, and derived addresses will be added there as well.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:47:09
Bitcoin Wallet dev here.
Fortunately, if you don't create new addresses you only need to backup your key(s) once. BIP32 will even do away with that limitation, it will derive keys/addresses for you in the background.
@_date: 2014-05-28 07:03:56
It's because it won't make a difference. Unlike the PC wallets, Bitcoin Wallet stores the private keys in app-private storage. An attacker needs root to defeat the sandboxing model. If he got root, he can just as easily record your keystrokes or wait until your private keys sit unencrypted in memory.
I'm planning to add password-encrypted wallets anyway, due to the high demand. But it will only help in case you borrow or loose your phone.
Afaik, Mycelium uses the same security model for the private keys, but is less secure when it comes to receive payments because you need to trust their centralized infrastructure.
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:33:43
They can be hacked via USB or remote via network (if connected). Sniffing software can be made persistent via PostScript or traditionally at OS level. Security conferences have a lot of talks on this topic.
Management summary: You can't trust your printer any more.

@_date: 2014-08-11 00:03:23
There is more parameters. How quick do you expire keys on the chain? If wallets do this in a different way, they are not interchangable any more.
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:15:29
How would you check identity, given that Bitcoin shall remain anonymous? Bluetooth doesn't know how the person holding the phone or sitting behind the counter looks.
@_date: 2014-09-02 22:12:41
That would be the first direction: getting the payment request from the merchant to the customer. Now, what would be the second direction?
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:58:09
I don't know yet. Currently it's QR code only.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:22:43
I have looked at integrating Bluetooth LE into Bitcoin Wallet. I must say I'm a bit skeptical because it's missing the proximity property of both QR codes and NFC. It can easily be intercepted and man-in-the-middled. PayPal+iBeacon literally takes money out of your pocket without your intervention. This can work only because PayPal can undo transactions, which Bitcoin can't -- by design.
This doesn't mean Bluetooth LE can't be used for Bitcoin. Maybe all we need is per merchant opt-in and a proper payment confirm dialog (on the phone's lock screen). But for opt-in, you still need one of the existing methods for first contact.
Because if this, I think Bluetooth LE can only complement QR codes and NFC, not replace them.
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:33:02
Yes, it's a fork. I think they didn't touch the payment protocol implementation.
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:26:42
Hive implemented it as well, but when they moved to their cordova-based cross-platform app they kind of un-implemented it again. )-:
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:59:58
Be careful. Going back from 4.x to 3.x is not supported, and most likely you will loose track of some of your funds if you do that.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:09:48
NFC and the payment protocol is implemented in Bitcoin Wallet since 2011 (and BIP70 since 2014). This means instant transactions if you use the app on both ends. All it needs is more apps supporting these standards.
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:16:21
Of course the phishing site could just as well have appearing as a normal search result.
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:56:05
Obviously? Can you share your insight? I currently see no alternative as commonly available as QR codes.
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:34:06
You won't get the BTC &lt;&gt; local currency conversion of Coinbase / BitPay by just installing some software.
If you're using Coinbase just as a web-wallet: Go to
and pick one with a high "decentralized" score. Those will be resilient against regulations etc.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:08:51
Yes, there is: The app is open source. Feel free to review the source and build your own apk. The more eyes on the code, the better.
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:03:53
You don't need to give away your private key for this to work with Bitcoin. It can be your phone responding by a merchants payment request without your intervention. This is not to say I like the thought of it. Just say it would be possible without leaking the key.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:02:34


That's true. Although its almost straight-forward BIP70 nowadays. Andy is working on a BIP.


Yeah, but that goal was already reached in 2011. No need to re-invent the wheel.
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:57:19
QR codes are not meant to be copied to the clipboard. They are shown on screen and scanned by another device. If you copy them to the clipboard then yes, they're vulnerable to the same attack.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:20:35
I wouldn't be surprised if what we're seeing is someone just stole these Bitcoins. There govnm't people are just too incompetent to hold e-mail addresses confidently, let alone private keys...
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:24:23
Bitcoin Wallet can send and receive "raw" transactions via QR code. It uses gzip compression and Base43 encoding to squeeze every bit of a QR code.
That feature has been rolled out in 2011 already to half a million users.
@_date: 2014-07-13 09:06:09
It uses the BIP70 payment protocol via Bluetooth. Of course, if you really need to *broadcast* the transaction, at least the merchant needs an internet connection. But the merchant is more likely to own a fixed line.
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:23:38
It can take several weeks in the worst case, I'd say.
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:00:39
 Plus, if you design this feature to be compatible with Bitcoin Wallet you'd already have half a million users to airgap transactions with...
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:20:30
BLE proximity is very coarse, not nearly fine enough to separate customers standing in line. It's not possible to force a "tap gesture" like with NFC. PayPal+iBeacon forces this "billing to the correct customer" to the cashier, who will see portraits of the customers standing in line on his terminal so he can pick the one he's talking to.
An attacker could currently intercept and forge a payment request, redirecting payments to himself. Plus still unknown attacks to future extensions of the payment protocol (BIP70).
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:04:53
Here is a good selection of wallets:

I think the important point is that anybody can start mining at any time. No centralized authority can prevent that.
And the current centralization is also not a single entitiy, but a mining pool of lots of miners. Any of them can switch to other pools (or solo mining) at any time.

Actually yes. There used to be a branch of Bitcoin Wallet that has a special "micropayments" screen. One problem is it's way out of date, probably a year old or so.

To clarify: Proximity is not fine enough. You cannot separate customers standing in line. It's not possible to force a "tap gesture" like with NFC.

Thought about this for Bitcoin Wallet. The issue is chargebacks. You'd need to take at least a 20% "risk premium", and then there is the 30% commission for Google…

It depends a bit on the firmware you're going to replace. Is that firmware still updated by the manufacturer? What version of Cyanogenmod are you going to use. Hint: I'd refrain from experiments like nightly builds etc.
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:50:04
Limited resources.
For example, you cannot derive 100 keys on the fly. It takes about one minute. The BouncyCastle guys have greatly optimized their algorithms in the past weeks, but now their new version needs to get released.
For now, all derived addresses need to be kept, growing the wallet as you use it. This can exhaust memory on old devices. Etc...
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:27:39
For upgrades, the seed is derived from the first random key that's already in the wallet. And that one is backed up already I guess.

Android 2.2 has serious flaws with its BigInteger implementation. That means you run the risk of not being able to spend some coins sent into any wallet installed on that phone.

The QR code contains the payment request message. If you can forge that, you can redirect payments to your address. That's clearly a serious threat.

Rotation of keys or chains of keys means all funds from one key/chain are sent to a new chain. An event such as last years Android RNG disaster makes this necessary.
Re-using change addresses sounds like a bug to me. It should pick a fresh one every time.

Payment request messages are not like Bitcoin transactions. They go from one payee to payer, traditionally via scan of a QR code (this is what this whole reddit post is about). Since its a message from A to B, it can be intercepted by C. Which is why its a good idea to chose a medium of communication that makes it obvious there is no MITM.

BIP39 is just a wordlist. It doesn't define the hierarchical structure. There is BIP44, but we cannot support that because it mandates the "accounts" which we don't have. So we currently support BIP32-hierarchy (default account only).

If you want to pay a merchant reliably, you better pick a wallet that is capable of paying even without internet connection.
Afaik, *only* [Bitcoin Wallet]( and [Hive]( (for Android) can do this.
All other wallets (be it Coinbase, Electrum or Mycelium) depend on a server or at least an Internet connection to do transactions.
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:46:24
How is this different to what Bitcoin Wallet has implemented since years?
From what I understand from their website: you pay by tapping two phones together. That's nothing new afaict. And it doesn't require a special brand phone or a special version of Android. Any NFC chip will do.
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:55:29
What about tap-to-pay (aka NFC)?
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:08:06
Because with Entropy, you need to be able to trust your printer. Almost all printers, especially those with USB port, have gaping security holes.
Imho Entropy should come with a small display for showing an encryption passphrase for the private key. Sure, it would make the device more expensive. But at the same time secure.
@_date: 2014-07-24 12:33:11

Security is not a beauty contest.
I agree NFC should be more widespread. But NFC on Android is the bigger problem, market share of iOS is tiny anyway.
@_date: 2014-12-12 11:13:38
Without display and buttons, such a device cannot add anything to security.

Author of Bitcoin Wallet here.
The app offers to archive your backup to mail or cloud storage. Check if you perhaps accepted that offer. Check all your installed email apps/accounts (e.g. G-Mail, k9-mail) and cloud storage apps (e.g. Drive, DropBox, ...) for files/e-mail attachments called bitcoin-wallet-backup-xxxx-xx-xx or bitcoin-wallet-keys-xxxx-xx-xx.
Does that help?
I should probably add more warnings to the app.
Paper wallets have their own share of pitfalls so I generally do not suggest to use them, especially not as a backup medium.
@_date: 2014-08-23 17:47:42
Transaction Export:
Can you describe the usecase a little bit more? Which columns would you expect?
I'm afraid this is not going to happen (by me). iOS is entirely incompatible to Android, so nothing can be reused. Also these days it's not very relevant any more.
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:53:48
For now, you still use traditional backups via files. The 12 word systems are currently quite incompatible, so we (all wallet developers) need to work on improving interoperability.

I will be working on a spending PIN right after this update is done.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:36:44
You can do Bluetooth pairing with standard (non-LE) Bluetooth already. But that's much more tedious than quickly scanning a QR code or tapping another phone. Scan-to-pay doesn't require you to know or compare names and PINs. In fact, you don't need to talk at all if you don't want to.
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:44:43
Still only a minority of wallets support the payment protocol.
Having to rely on an Internet connection when sending payments is one of the show stoppers imho.
@_date: 2014-08-11 00:05:01
It won't work then. But 2k of transaction is pretty huge, and I'm using compression.

Author of Bitcoin Wallet here.
The app stores your Bitcoins on the phone. If you're not connected you'll receive the Bitcoin as soon as you are connected. Or, if you're transacting with an offline transaction capable device such as the app itself, you'll receive your coins even if you're not connected to the Internet.
There is no login or account. All you do is install the app. You need to back up your wallet though. Use Options &gt; Safety &gt; Backup and Options &gt; Safety &gt; Restore for that. Make sure to read the safety notes in the app.

Why should it? A QR code is not an input field.
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:46:12
Most likely you will end up having paid twice.
For next time:
- Pay with enabled Bluetooth. That way, you don't need an Internet connection.

Instead of TCP you could support Bluetooth as well. It will make it more reliable against connectivity issues. Which I'm sure will happen a lot, no matter how much effort you put into poking through firewall techniques.

MultiBit can "scan" a QR code you paste via the clipboard? Yes, that's certainly unexpected use of QR codes. I'd expect MultiBit to be able to access your webcam and scan from there. Or, access NFC if your computer has that and receive payment requests via near-field communications. Both is more secure than using the clipboard.

In order to be compatible, you need to implement
1. derivation function (BIP32)
2. a common hierarchy (e.g. BIP32 or BIP43+BIP44)
3. a wordlist (BIP39)
Wallets have so far not found a hierarchy that suits them all.

[Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry) has had NFC + Bluetooth payments since 2011. Alternatively, the transaction can be transmitted via QR-Code.
Neither of the sides needs Internet connectvity, but if the payee doesn't have Internet he/she needs to trust the payer to some extent, as he/she will not see blockchain confirmations until s/he's connected again.

Answers to couple of statments from this thread:
Your keys are encrypted with the PIN, so there is no way to sneak around it. (If there were, it would be a severe bug.)
Yes, you can backup and restore without the PIN but it won't magically decrypt the wallet. So if you had a PIN set at backup time, the PIN will still be set after restoring.
You could take the backup file to a PC and try all combinations there. A starting point for coding is "wallet-tool" from bitcoinj, you could add a "brute force PIN" feature. Be aware that even trying 10.000 combinations will take a while, because the algorithm uses Scrypt for key stretching.

If done right, SPV doesn't take a long time to sync because SPV uses checkpoints.
In the case of [Bitcoin Wallet]( you still able to send even if peers cannot be reached, via the BIP70 payment protocol. Even via Bluetooth, NFC and QR Code if your entire Internet connection is down.
SPV wallets can't be lied to as soon as a transaction is confirmed. As opposed to centralized wallets, which can be lied to at any time (by their central authority). I agree that unconfirmed transactions are problematic if you can't trust the sender, but it's even worse with centralized wallets.

1. Right or wrong, it depends on the context. When we implemented LinuxSecureRandom back in Aug 2013, we didn't know how much devices have /dev/urandom. And we certainly didn't want to lock out half of our users. *Now* we know virtually all devices implement /dev/urandom, so we will not support those without any more (if there are any at all).
2. Bitcoin Wallet is much more used than blockchain.info. If there are any randomness issues, we should know by now. For all we know, there have not been any RNG-related thefts since we implemented the LinuxSecureRandom workaround.
3. There is no evidence that `Security.insertProviderAt()` ever fails. What *could* happen is that "someone else" (a framework, library) inserts a provider after us.
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:59:15
Not that HTTPS would help much if the system has no/bad entrophy… better solution would be to read random data from /dev/urandom.

The problem is *time is limited*. "Let's work out…" isn't very helpful. Concepts needs to be thought out. Code needs to be written and well tested. Unless you have the finished off blockchain solution on your harddrive, I doubt it will come in time.
If Bitcoin catches on, there will be plenty of opportunities to roll out more elegant concepts, whatever that means.

They stopped publishing the source to their app, which

The code is now used by several hundred thousands devices and so far I got no report of a missing `/dev/urandom`. Mycelium also have seen zero.
On top of that I just asked the guy who got robbed his 6 BTC for what phone he's using (didn't find that info in any of the threads). Honestly, I believe bc.i should start searching for another explanation.

Indeed. Bitcoin Wallet is a hobby/community project. There is no revenue model (apart from the occasional donation).

If you have an Android device, install [Bitcoin Wallet]( and run it, tap "Request coins" and there you are. You can use the QR Code or tap on the Share icon to share the Bitcoin URI to someone per email or chat message.

With GMail for Android and [Bitcoin Wallet]( embedding Bitcoin URIs in emails and clicking on them works as intended.
You could also attach a BIP70 Payment Request to the mail – the recipient will be able to tap on the attachment.

A good place for comparing wallets is 
Regarding sending coins between wallets on the same phone: it depends on the wallet. For example Bitcoin Wallet ( has a "Request coins from local app" action on the request coins screen.

Thanks for this proof of concept. It's however not new, I think [Aegis Wallet]( implements a very similar thing.
It's however not more secure than keeping the private keys sandboxed on the phone. Unless the NFC would be able to sign Bitcoin transactions and have a trusted UI. (An NFC version of Trezor would be nice as a companion for mobile devices.)
A better use for NFC is transmitting the BIP70 payment request: [Sender taps phone to the receiver]( confirms the transaction on screen.

The 20 minute rule obviously doesn't help with creating blocks faster than 1 per 10 minutes on average.
Testnet simply is "plagued" by ASIC miners who mine at rates of several blocks per minute. Probably hardware which isn't profitable on mainnet any more.

Deterministic means not a single bit can be different. Usual culprits are:
1. Time values that are somehow dependent on the system clock (e.g. filesystem last modified time)
2. Ordering of files, can be filesystem dependent (case sensitiveness)
3. Code signatures
1 and 2 can be fixed easily. 3 needs careful re-thought of the code signing process.

Trezor is actually agnostic of any hierarchy, as long as the HD standard itself is based on BIP32. At some point I'll implement support for Trezor, if no one else beats me at it.
That said, the BIP32-hierarchy-default-account bitcoinj is using right now is actually compatible to BIP43. We only need to reserve "BIP43 usage 0" for "BIP32 default accounts". See my proposal hiere:

@_date: 2014-12-07 14:19:25
There is no such thing as a final address. Addresses are meant to be only used once.
If you meant 'wallet' that's fine. However, there is nothing wrong with doing the experiments with the same wallet you're planning to continue using except if the experiments involve exporting/sharing the private keys somehow.

1. For now, we haven't seen a single device without `/dev/urandom`. It *is* known for some implementations to not allow write access, but [LinuxSecureRandom]( does not write.
2. Neverless, as you [pointed out]( LinuxSecureRandom in future will stop execution if /dev/urandom cannot be found or if it cannot be read. So if there are broken devices, we should know soon.
3. To all our best knowledge, no RNG-related losses have occured since the Android RNG issue became known and we implemented the workaround early August 2013. Bitcoin Wallet is used a lot more than blockchain.info, so if there was a problem with randomness, it should be known by now.

Theoretically yes, depending on the changes. However up to now, backwards compatibility was always a concern and it will likely be in future.
The biggest threat could come from high fees by the community not allowing more room in the block chain: at some point you can't spend your paper wallet economically any more.

Just read the comments on GitHub.
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:43:14
Just one small note: Bitcoin Wallet uses a combination of NFC and Bluetooth for offline payments. The reason is if you would use only NFC then you would need to NFC-tap twice: once for getting the payment request, then you would likely want to look at your screen to verify the amount etc., and then you'd need to NFC-tap a second time for sending the signed transaction. This is why the second tap is replaced by a Bluetooth socket connection.
Mycelium does not support offline payments at all. In a way, they are very similar to Circle in that they need to forward transactions to their servers (and require being online for that).

You used [Bitcoin Wallet]( to create this backup. Read
You'll need a backup password though. Otherwise there is no way to decrypt the backup. You will maybe also need a spending PIN, if you set one. Otherwise, you will not be able to spend from the restored wallet.

Yes, but it's not recommended. See
(there is an option to wallet-tool dump that prints the private keys)
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:34:49
FSS-RBF is an interesting thought but there are issues:
* It's more or less incompatible to wallets that are not online all the time. That means a massive battery drain.
* It's more or less incompatible to wallets that can't sign without user intervention, e.g. all wallets with a spending PIN.
* It can't be used to raise fees for a transaction received. Only for those sent. But for those sent an app can just make sure to pay enough fees in the first place.
* Afaik it needs to be supported not only by the miners, but also by all nodes (because it's a double spend).
So don't hold your breath for it.

Do you have a transaction hash? What's the byte-size of the transaction? The amount is irrelevant. The fee seems reasonable as long as the byte size is the usual ~500 bytes. Even during spam hours similar transactions confirm within a few blocks.

It would be more useful if you'd post a tx hash.

Stop using bc.i! At least don't blame other companies for when bc.i is broken (again).

* As a recipient you cannot use RBF since you cannot sign for the sender. However in reality it's the recipient who cares about confirmation times not the sender.
* RBF is also not really compatible to multisig and timelocked contracts. (Though this doesn't apply to Bitcoin Wallet since it only uses standard payments.)
* RBF breaks chains of transactions by double spending outputs, whereas CPFP behaves nicely and doesn't change the original transaction.
Thus, we realized offering CPFP has more value for users.
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:27:48
The latest version of [Bitcoin Wallet]( supports [child-pays-for-parent]( for raising the fee.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:25:11
Perhaps you (or anyone else) would like help with the [Greek transaction]( of [Bitcoin Wallet]( It's currently at 80%.
However we're unfunded and cannot offer money, only a credit in the authors list and lots of karma (-:
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:52:39
We should be working on decreasing that risk, not increasing.
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:36:07
A better way to raise the fee is "child pays for parent" (CPFP). Some wallets can already do it – if yours can't ask for the feature.
@_date: 2015-07-13 06:57:00
Probably because there is no Debian package so far.
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:56:20
It is realistically decreased with the first-seen rule, which RBF wants to get rid of. It can be decreased even more, e.g. double spend alerts.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:50:00
In this specific case the only output that could be used or CPFP (change output, index 0) isn't worth enough. I currently hardcoded CPFP to pay twice the priority fee which is 1 mBTC.
@_date: 2015-07-18 08:13:57
FWIW: [Bitcoin Wallet]( supports [increasing the fee]( for a transaction that was already sent (or received).
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:32:29
RBF is not a replacement for CPFP.

In general, auto-updating is a good thing. But if you prefer to not auto-update, just disable in the Play Store app or install manually from:

Yes, it's planned.

The fix is on Google Play, version 4.37. Note only version 4.36 was affected by the regression.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:59:21
Yes, there is a thin line between test and attack. I still call this test because it is capped at about 15.000 tx in the mempool (according to statoshi). If it was truely an attack, why would the "attacker" cap?
I agree about the low block size cap. Max block size needs to increase.

It's a pity the ATM doesn't seem to support the Bluetooth payment protocol. If it would, the payment would have arrived much quicker.
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:20:05
Perhaps because the recent 1 MB transaction caused their system to break down. Obviously, they'd better spend their time on fixing the root cause.

The specific wallets that had this happening were out of sync for years. Hence the large data. We've since changed the app so that in such situations sync is only started on unmetered networks (e.g. Wifi).

Hi, I'm [Bitcoin Wallet]( I'm almost four and half years old! (-:
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:41:58
Transactions do not have a time. What you see is the block times, so the time of the first confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:20:55
Actually that's a brilliant idea!
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:15:31
Consequentally you should change your faucet, not the wallet. Because the faucet is paying the fee, probably not enough fee.

It's valid, so it's up to the miner if he wants to include that transaction.
@_date: 2016-02-22 09:11:28
However you choose, you should not keep your purchased Bitcoin at the exchange. Rather, move it to a decentralized wallet:

- [Breadwallet]( (iOS).
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:52:46
Full-RBF would make Bitcoin entirely unusable for mobile payments/shops/markets. And of course it also suffers from the above issues.
@_date: 2015-07-19 20:05:53
It didn't work well at all. Transaction confirmations at certain fee levels became very unpredictable. It showed that the fee market won't work, at least not without further changes.
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:35:36
Not true, the backlog is still growing. E.g. see Statoshi:
You can also see from the transactions per second that on average it's above the calculative maxiumum of 5-7 tx/second.
I fear it will stay like that (or worse) until we have bigger blocks.
btw. If the backlog of your node is smaller that's perhaps because you restarted it – the mempool isn't persisted to disk so it will take a while for your node to learn of all the unconfirmed transactions again.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:16:24
You are refering to raising the fee of an unconfirming transaction.
Just tap on the transaction and select "Raise fee" from the context menu. You'll see a confirmation dialog that will prompt you to enter your spending PIN (if you've got one).
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:19:09
I suggest using the [BIP70]( payment protocol. It starts with a [BIP72]( URL.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:10:03
This is called "child pays for parent" (CPFP) and actually there are wallets that support it, e.g. [Bitcoin Wallet](
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:32:33
No wallet can undo the damage the so-called "fee market" does to Bitcoin. Bank transfers and credit card payments are free, so why should anyone pay a fee at all?
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:37:18
Can you back this claim with test results?
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:21:46
The format you're looking for is called WIF (wallet import format) and is e.g. supported by Bitcoin Core.
Why don't you downgrade to an older version of the app (6.35 or below), restore from the backup, upgrade to the latest version and then backup again (this time in the new format)?
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:07:54
A bigger block size will make the whole attack unfeasible.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:30:58
That's right, you send it to another wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:45:43
It means your transaction is not yet confirmed by the Bitcoin blockchain.

Auto-adjusting fees are simply not possible with decentralized wallets. It would need changes to the core protocol that were rejected.
If you have an urgent transaction, for now I suggest using "priority fee". It's Send Coins &gt; Options &gt; Fee &gt; Priority.

I suggest truly decentralized wallets on your mobile phone:

@_date: 2016-09-11 09:56:27
I'd recommend [Bitcoin Wallet]( on Android. It's really just install and launch. It reads only the blockchain headers, which is just a tiny subset of the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:15:53
Sure, if you assume the existence of a second device (be it a server, or a watch/ring/tag you hold to the device), you've got much safer options.
However, the idea of Bitcoin Wallet is you can pay with just using your phone, without Internet access at all (via Bluetooth/Wifi Direct link to the merchant, if needed). So encryption of keys has to stay local.
@_date: 2015-04-05 08:04:18
You're describing the inherent problems of passwords. If you've got a better idea, let me know.
@_date: 2015-04-04 07:41:26
Any wallet that supports the BIP70 payment protocol should support that feature because it's part of the specification. However, you need to create a payment request that splits up the payment.
@_date: 2015-04-04 07:33:49
Well, it's a PIN, so that PIN is all entrophy you got. The magic lies in [key stretching]( via Scrypt. And of course you should pick an 8 digit PIN if you're able to remember.
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:56:48
Even on a rooted device there is process isolation for non-root processes. You just need to pay attention to which programs you sudo.
Having wallet encryption sure doesn't hurt. For example [Bitcoin Wallet]( can *receive* coins without entering the spending PIN. Only for *sending* (signing) you need to know the PIN. That kind of role model is not possible with fulll disk encryption.
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:10:41
One of the main problems with using Google Play services is you need to link a closed-source client library. So effectively your open source project suddenly becomes closed source. You cannot assert any more there isn't malicious code hiding in the app.
This is the reason Bitcoin Wallet for Android never started to use Google Play services.
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:40:54
[Bitcoin Wallet]( for Android and BlackBerry encrypts your private keys using AES if you set a spending PIN.
@_date: 2015-04-04 07:28:35
If possible, avoid Windows. It's a security nightmare. Instead, I'd recommend a mobile OS like Android (recent version) or iOS.

[Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry OS) is exactly designed for this usecase. It's safe, very user friendly and perfect for daily transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-03 08:39:48
Afaik Mycelium doesn't use the spending PIN to encrypt the keys. They do offer a "reset PIN" feature in case you've lost it, which would not be possible with proper encryption.

I suggest truly decentralized wallets:
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry) or
- [Breadwallet]( (iOS).
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:40:37
I suggest:
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry)
- Install from Google Play / BlackBerry World
- Start the app
- You're ready to receive and spend
This can be done in 10 seconds, since the app is also very small (2.5 MB).
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:33:52
Very cool! Do you also support Bluetooth offline payments? Without that, you'd need to NFC-tap a second time to transmit the transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:42:09
That's what a wallet backup is for. The app instructs you how to do that.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:02:26
I wouldn't call it "mathematically". "Statistically" would be a better term imho.
Anyway, the first wallet that implemented this scheme is [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry).

I suggest truly decentralized wallets. These two wallets are good for taking the Bitcoins with you, for spending:
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry) or
- [Breadwallet]( (iOS).
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:36:11
This is correct. It's also called CPFP (child pays for parent).
@_date: 2015-03-12 08:22:36
Online the customer is offline. The merchant can still use a full node to validate transactions, if he wishes to.
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:54:56
That's not entirely. Sure, anybody can contribute code, but in the end it must be merged by one of the 5 people with commit access.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:10:52
Why don't you just update Bitcoin Wallet to a recent version? It's got dynamic fees, CPFP and so on. We work hard to stay on top, but it doesn't help if you keep using ancient versions.
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:32:48
I suggest [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry).
It's very similar to Breadwallet and has been HD for a long time.

Don't worry, it's only the duplicate that was marked as invalid. The original transaction, in your screenshot directly below the duplicate one, was confirmed.

@_date: 2016-05-03 21:42:57

- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry OS) or
- [Breadwallet]( (iOS).
@_date: 2015-10-03 13:50:36
Generally, wallet formats are not compatible. It's much easier and safer to just use a Bitcoin transaction to move value from one wallet to the other.

With [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry), you can send as many transactions as you like in a short period. They might all get in the same block. This is because for receiving change, there is no requirement for confirmation.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:55:41
Actually you don't need a "payment system". Just use any decentralized wallet, like:
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry) or
- [Breadwallet]( (iOS).
To protect the wallets from spending by unauthorized persons, both recommendations offer a spending PIN that encrypts the private keys.
If you go the Android route, you've got the advantage that your customers can pay without an Internet connection (via Bluetooth). Don't underestimate this  reason for payment delays.
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:58:20
These ATMs need to do better risk analysis for selling coins. It's really a nuisance that customers needs to wait for confimations. At least for small amounts, they could rely on metrics like transaction propagation and how much network fee was paid by the sender.

The Bitcoin Wallet README has some info on enabling NFC tags for bitcoin:
(scroll down to the NFC section)
Important: If you put your tag at a public place, don't forget to enable write protect. Otherwise, someone
could overwrite the tag with his own Bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:52:29
Even on Andoid, the NFC feature doesn't work. It opens the Play Store page on the other device, rather than my Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:34:24
Why should a hardware be more secure? Think about it: any malware that has root on your Android device can ask the keystore to sign a malicious transaction. Without a trusted I/O (display and buttons) there is no way for the hardware to know if the transaction is legitimate.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:16:15
[Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry OS) has an "economic" fee option.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:05:59
Why don't you use [Bitcoin Wallet]( instead? It should be pretty similar to Breadwallet, except Bitcoin Wallet is also optimized for tablets and Android 4/5.
@_date: 2016-07-21 17:45:14
There is no security benefit from hardware encryption. A malware can simply instruct it to sign a transaction that sends your Bitcoins away! As long as there is no separate trusted I/O (e.g. a Trezor device connected via USB) there is nothing gained.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:46:14
Yes, Marshmellow is more secure than previous versions of Android.
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:58:24
[Bitcoin Wallet]( (Android, BlackBerry OS) is designed to be lightweight, secure and without any bloatware or unnecessary features.
@_date: 2016-07-23 18:54:18
Verified boot guarantees this? Let's imagine an exploit like Stagefright. Even with verified boot I'd gain root, right? As root, I can talk to the HAL and pretend to be breadwallet, no? What's the exact mechanism that prevents this?

Bitcoin Wallet for Android already has got a framework you can use in your app. Search for the android integration sub project. I'll post details when I'm back home.
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:16:12
Sorry, that doesn't convince me. Verified boot only protects against installing firmware+drivers not signed by the manufacturer. It doesn't help with vulnerabilities in correctly signed firmware.
Hardware encryption protects against reading the private key (assumedly only the seed) on an exploited device. However, nothing protects you from getting a transaction signed by that key!
@_date: 2013-01-15 15:40:00
Ok, here is the full story. Check out the BItcoin Wallet source:
Its got two subprojects
**integration-android** which you can link to your app and creates an Intent and can also parse the result/return code of the Intent.
and **sample-integration-android** which is a small demo of how to use it in your app.
If you just want to have a quick look at the feature, you can also install Öffi
and try to donate some Bitcoins in Options-&gt;About.
You must know that although your app gets a return code and a transaction hash, you cannot rely on that. Android is open by design, which means anyone can install a stub and send your app any return code it expects. So if you need to be sure, take the transaction hash and validate it against any infrastructure you might have. If it's just for donations, obviously this is not needed.
The library is supported by Bitcoin Wallet and BitcoinSpinner currently, and any wallet is welcome to support the Intent as well. Its open source and APLv2 licensed.

Its using so-called "checkpoints". That's blocks which are so far buried below later blocks that they can be considered final. On first-time startup, Bitcoin Wallet just fast-forwards to the latest checkpoint.

If you want a secure and easy-to-use wallet without frills, we suggest:

The bottom line tells you how far the blockchain sync got. If its saying "Use at your own risk..." the block chain is up to date. So depending on how far the sync is, your phone might be seeing the confirmations or not. If you mail me at my developer address (see app), I might be able to help you directly.

Which OS are you running? The devs are currently hunting down a blockchain curruption issue with MacOS. I'm not sure, maybe the fix will already be in 0.8.4.

I'm the author of Bitcoin Wallet, the app involved here.
The wallet file (called wallet-protobuf) might not be the best file to look for. It's encoded in binary and contains a ton of other stuff (transactions, confidences, list structures and so on).
I'd look for one of the copies of key-backup-base58[.xx] (depending on your usage pattern, there can be several dozens of it). They are text-based, contain just your private keys in base58 format and - perhaps most important - all contain the first line "# KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS SAFE! Anyone who can read this can spend your Bitcoins."
So if you have access to your internal storage or a dump of your ram with the app loaded, look for this string and collect any base58-encoded keys following. (Actually you could also make up a pattern that directly matches base58-encoded keys, but I'm not sure how many false positives you'd have.
However, if you've not had root at the time you did these backups, I'm afraid chances are slim that your backup actually contains anything useful.
Next time, I suggest using "Export private keys" in the action bar overflow menu.

I know. So how is it supposed to help?

Try restoring your backup with version 6.35 of Bitcoin Wallet. That's the last version that supports those ancient backups. Download link: [

The app has got a feature for directly sending tx from the sender to the receiver. Go to Options &gt; Settings &gt; Labs and enable "Bluetooth offline transactions" (on both sides). I'll make that more visible once the feature has been tested a little bit.
Also, the sender can show the tx as a QR code which the receiver can scan. The same is also possible with NFC. It's been implemented since 2011 now.

There is not really a difference between a "hardware wallet" and an Android phone that you use nothing else for. If you don't use any other apps, no web browser and no email reading the chance of being exploited is drastically reduced. A low risk remains, but any hardware wallet can be exploited too.
If Bitcoin takes off, I bet there will be creditcard sized Android devices that use a tailored-to-fit version of Android.
Note that wallets need access to the block chain, so NFC alone won't do it. At least you need WLAN or Bluetooth.

I'd like to add that this has been improved in recent versions. You can now spend your own change immediately.

I suggest picking a wallet that
a) stores your coins (private keys) locally and not on in the cloud and
b) does not depend on proprietary communication to a server in order to see your funds.
Basically, go to  and choose your wallet between the ones that do not have any warning.
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:17:32
 Author of Bitcoin Wallet here. Can you send the logs and tell what time it happened so we can look up what happened for you? Use Options &gt; Settings &gt; Report issue and in the description somehow refer to this post so I know its you. Thanks!

I'd like b.i without the service/web page. Everything running locally, on your device. Zero trust.

Author of Bitcoin Wallet here. Did you ever share your wallet between multiple devices? Can you mail me a dump of your wallet from within the app? Its Options &gt; Settings &gt; Report issue and check "Wallet dump". In the generated mail, please refer to this reddit post. Note the wallet dump doesn't contain your private keys.

From their commercial video it looks like it will rely on a custom backend. I think that's not a good idea for a Bitcoin wallet, especially if you plan to promote it as "anarchic" etc.

At present, this looks like a violation of the GPLv3 license. Its a fork of Bitcoin Wallet for Android.
They are shipping binaries (on their homepage) without the source. At the very least, they need to link to a github repo or something similar.

You're invited to the Berlin Bitcoin Meetup next Thursday. It's in Room77, starting at 19h (I will be there from 21h on).

By the way, if you trust me, you can send me the files your have via GPG encrypted email and I'd have a look at it.

Anyway, what's so bad about a circle jerk? Have you ever tried?

Do not trust your Bitcoins to a remote (web)service. Bitcoins are meant to be stored locally, on your own device.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:35:57
Its implemented in Bitcoin Wallet since version 3.25.

To a certain extent, you can use [offline transactions]( Bitcoin does not strictly need the Blockchain, as long as you can trust the people you are trading with. So if the Internet would only blackout for one day, you can still get your groceries and transactions will be confirmed on the next day.
