Really good android application for checking rates also you can add currencies to your wallet which you have bought at your exchange to check it closely plus it assist you in buying and selling and show notifications whenever needed. And it's completely free. Worth a try.

Bought a few currencies an hour earlier as this app said to buy. Even though i wasn't sure if these currencies to buy, a couple of hours later this application told me to sell these at 2.5% profit. I'm happy but shouldn't they offer a little more profit?
