Chinese drop shitloads of coins right now on every exchange. Prices going down heavily. If the 3000 barrier is broken, it's gonna be huge drop.

We need a usable p2pool software so that everyone starts mining. It's the only way, we need decentralized mining.
We need it easy to install &amp; configure, clean and with intuitive gui.

I hope they turned the btc into dollars, because soon their 13 btc will be worth peanuts at the actual falling rate.

ADS will never stop. Doesn't matter how much you give to creators or whatever. They get recurring incomes from ADS.
So you will donate bitcoins to them and you will still have ADS, spam and overloaded pages with advertisement, autostarting video, etc. We need ads blockers.

Thanks, I will setup up one. I can let it run, I will use the mac mini as my own cloud, running a node won't hurt, it's a good hardware with 2 SSD (one for system 500go and one 1TB for stuffs).
Doing it asap !

Node setup and running. I'm on board ! And btw, the blockchain is a piece of cake to download with 100mb / sec :p.

I took the 1.0 binary from there. Since this morning I have the message "unknown blocks are being mined. perhaps unknown rules are used blabla". I just ignore it ?
