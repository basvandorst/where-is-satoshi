[Everydayeclectic.com]( Everything that we sell is handmade by us in our shop. We started out with soap and candles in our kitchen in 2007. Now we make and sell soap, candles, jewelry, sodas, infused honey, brooms, lotions, balms, and anything else we can think of.

Not sure if being sarcastic ... or genuinely interested ...
But yes. This is an artisan business. Everything we sell is handmade my either my wife or myself (which the exception of the soda ... we have a couple people who assist with the manufacturing of that, but we still brew and bottle it in-house).
We started this six years ago out of our house. At first, all we had was soap and candles. Over the years, we have expanded into everything that we currently have listed, plus other things that we are working on launching.
For most of this journey, I was working full time as a web developer and graphic designer. I quit that 20 months ago to join my wife and I haven't looked back. We just finished re-launching our website with everything that we make and are really focusing on online sales for the first time.

Must the two be mutually exclusive?
Truthfully, I think the idea of Bitcoin is pretty awesome. Being in Chattanooga, Tennessee means that there aren't many merchants around that will accept it, but if I can be a part of changing that, then I will.

Yes, like Number Two opening a factory that makes little models of factories, we started a business six years ago that specializes in handcrafting businesses out of the finest raw materials. All you need is an abundance of tears and a soul or two.

~~We offer free shipping on orders of $50 or more. Plus, if you sign up for an account, then you get 100 reward points which you can use right away for a $10 discount which doesn't affect your total for the free shipping.~~
~~So yeah. You could get three bacon candles for $44 and not pay shipping. Plus, you get one reward point for each dollar spent, so after that order, you'd automatically have another $4.40 credit to spend on anything in our shop!~~
All of this was written before we realized that it would be impractical to offer free shipping on international orders. Sorry for the confusion!
