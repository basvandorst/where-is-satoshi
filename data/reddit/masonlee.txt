The best summary of the attack I've found is [here on the BitCoin wiki](

Satoshi Nakamoto might be discovered by tracing the flow of bit coins.

Can you explain?

Does this means that bitcoin is an ever-escalating arms race?  I keep looking for theories on how it is expected to play out.
One interesting piece I've found is here: 
It attempts to show that electricity use could theoretically stabilize, but that the proper energy expenditure is whatever it takes to protect the network.  And *that* looks like an interesting game theory problem.

Difficulty is what stabilizes the Bitcoin supply.  The dollar value of the Bitcoin should depend on the size of the world market for bitcoin-traded goods and savings. This is going to be highly speculative for a long time.  At $17USD/BTC and 6.5M Bitcoins, we have a total supply of 110 million dollars worth of Bitcoins out there right now.  Is that enough value to cover all the world trade and savings that happen (and will happen) in Bitcoins?  The rate of increase of Bitcoin supply is easily predictable, but the size of the Bitcoin economy is not.

Seems to me that the ease by which Bitcoins can be moved between online accounts makes online gaming a likely place for Bitcoin use to take root.  Another interesting data point:

Thanks.  So some serious guesswork as to equivalence has to be made.  There's some good discussion here:

Anyone have info as to the amount of currency in play at any given time in other online games?
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:27:26
To the question of the "Is the blockchain secure?", the [original bitcoin whitepaper]( offers this answer:  
"If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth." --Satoshi Nakamoto
In the case that this attacker is a late-comer to bitcoin with a stronger interest in another currency, I'm not sure this motivation holds.
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:41:15
Great question!  There is also info here:  
@_date: 2011-09-10 23:36:22
Other suggestions:
- Do not include the text "iBitcoin" in the icon.  It's against Apple UI guidelines to have redundant text in the icon.
- App title should probably be "iBitcoin" not "Bitcoin", right?
- Splash screens make apps feel slow and take users out of the iOS experience.  Merge with the device and lose the splash screen.
- The rounded corners on all screens need some major attention.
- Main screen has some cells sticking out of their boxes by a pixel or so.
- The mining icon is not Retina.
- The table cells in Setup should just be white standard iOS controls? ON/OFF switch looks weird otherwise.
Best luck!

Off topic, but anybody have links to Zooko commenting on Namecoin, which some say "solves" [Zooko's Triangle](

I like it.  Nice name.  How confident are you that you will be able to find someone to insure XBTC 100%?  Would that insurance contract be made public?  This seems like the linchpin of the whole operation.
@_date: 2011-07-14 16:27:43
Not necessarily a fair assumption that it's secure, though. Hashing power isn't directly comparable to flops (no flops are involved). This doesn't tell us that an effort couldn't be made to build a specialized hashing supercomputer.  Combined with DOS attacks on the largest mining pools, I'd think there is still opportunity for a determined attacker to introduce a little double spending chaos.
@_date: 2011-06-17 05:46:10
Love the icon.  Great app!
@_date: 2011-09-10 23:13:17
My thoughts, since you asked :)
Because this app is for a specialized market and looks awesome, I think you should price it at least $3.99.  Few potential customers who would want to pay, in the first place, for the best bitcoin app are going to change their minds over 2 dollars.  Besides, I would think a higher price could act as a tell-tale sign of the higher quality.
I did notice a UI glitch in the screen shots: The Market Prices table should be sized to fit full rows.  As is, the bottom row looks like it's poorly aligned in the table, especially where the red round rect is hitting the edge.  See the Apple Stocks.app as an example of a perfect fit.
Also, the statistics pages might benefit from evenly sized table cells?

Without insurance, what's to stop XBTC from declaring bankruptcy and walking away when catastrophe strikes?

Is the bitcoin blockchain secure?
According to [
all United States supercomputers listed in the top 500 *combined* can do 25.3 petaflops.
That's only about half of what would be required to take over the current bitcoin blockchain, which  shows to be backed by 104.1 petaflops.
EDIT:  In comments above, it's pointed out that typical supercomputers aren't built for computing hashes, and hashes per second doesn't map to flops.  Could a single new specialized super hash computer take over the bitcoin network if it were built on the scale of some of these top 500 machines?
@_date: 2011-06-24 22:20:48

...Because the researchers identified what they view as a fundamental weakness in the current Bitcoin algorithm: Competition to solve the longest block has a disincentive effect on transaction propagation.  If you want to mine the longest chain, you are at present better served by not passing incoming transactions to your peers.  A tragedy of the commons.
@_date: 2011-09-11 02:21:44
Mine, too! The sad thing is, an app like this probably won't be able to pay for itself.  An iOS contractor in the U.S. should be earning $60-125/hr, and an app like this, even though it looks simple, is easily hundreds of hours once polished, not including website time and cost.  Because of the App Store's "race-to-the-bottom" price expectations, specialized apps have a hard time making ends meet.
