I am no developer or programmer so I don't know. I just designed it.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:34:45
Just a few Apple products :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:26:11

@_date: 2014-03-28 15:59:25
Not sure about that still working on it, this is just one screen
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:56:57
Yea I know, It's still a work in progress so suggestions are taken into consideration.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:44:08
Hey can we get in contact? Igor
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:26:36
Keep the comments / suggestions coming. I am taking notes on everything and I eventually would like to take this to a programmer to actually update the design of the Bitcoin QT Wallet. I am hoping the Reddit Bitcoin community can help me out with this mission! 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:44:27
We'd have to discuss that off reddit. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:23:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:55:55
I've also been working on this:
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:45:38
What's the business... and how much work is it?
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:32:16
Its QT Wallet
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:01:29
Wish I could change the title so people know this is the QT Wallet

Update: A spokesperson in Senator Manchin’s office said that his call for regulation doesn’t yet extend to other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin or Dogecoin. And asked how such a ban would be technically feasible, he admitted that the senator is still trying to gather information on “different ways to protect consumers” that might entail a ban or simply increased regulation.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:15:59
Have not thought of that but a good idea depending on security. I will look into that. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:50:08

Thank You :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:49:00
I am sure there is a way to skin an application. I am just a designer tho :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:24:19
Thats a great idea thank you! 
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:43:50
I agree. In version 2.0  I will be fixing some design stuff/ adding some functions / information. Keep the comments / suggestions coming! Thank you!

The system manages the minting and transfer of karma coins and double spending detection. To
implement the CPU cycles battery metaphor presented in the introduction, coins can be minted
by a user by findnding collisions on a hash function (

@_date: 2014-03-28 15:53:40
I am going to find a programmer who knows how to skin apps and provide him assets. I will try to yes.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:59:38
I am loving the questions and suggestions keep em' coming!
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:22:53
Do you know how I would go about doing this?
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:29:48
what? Its a pdf paper.. how do i put it somewhere people will read it?
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:35:18
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:26:58
Just posted a comment about that. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:12:22
If this can be a serious project I can do it professionally with wireframes / designs / assets. Are functionality additions possible? Or only a "Re-Skin"? Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:29:05
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:27:35
Yes this is a modification of the QT Wallet. It is still a work in progress. Thank You!
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:44:08
Yes this is QT Wallet
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:20:23
850x620. And when it does I will share it with everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:41:53
Thank you! I can help you, but I wont really design for fun lol
@_date: 2019-11-02 12:37:34
What do we want? Time travel! When do we want it? It’s irrelevant.

This isn’t about idiots losing money, this is about average users needing a super simple UI to manage their finances. It has nothing to do with what kind of finances because users don’t care what’s behind the UI... just like the average driver couldn’t tell you anything about what is under the hood of their own car.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:44:40
As a product design lead in the tech / startup / enterprise software business I agree. 
As designers we conduct a ton of usability tests and to assume that users will understand how to use an interface or to assume the user will do something a specific way because you think it’s right / easy is totally false and never is reality. 
We user test super simple interfaces with college students and even they always request things like “just make it as easy as tinder”... even for enterprise interfaces they want the same ease of use. Users want the User Interface to do the work for them. 
The goal is to design something so easy to
use we always say “will my grandma be able to use this without any help?” That’s the goal.
Remember. The best user interface is no user interface. Don’t make the user think at all. 
In 2015-2016 there were a lot of articles saying that the user experience and customer experience will beat and be more important than anyone’s actual brand identity by 2020
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:08:31
It’s more about that these days, users have become used to existing usability patterns that are being reused in user interface design, with crypto we have to keep re using the same usability patterns that existed before. This way the average user has no issues because they do not care about what is happening in the background as long as it works, is easy and familiar.
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:10:35
These people are pretty much the majority of mobile and desktop device users.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:48:14
Nope you aren’t! This is an updated design!
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:16:35
Nope, I only design.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:38:50
Thanks! I am still working on some of the functionality and usability for the UI, more to come!
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:50:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:43:34
Yup just visual stuff
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:56:21
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:39:57
For now I am just focusing on BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:30:29
This one is in Vienna.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:35:41
For sure! Yes, Vienna was awesome. I recommend Prague as well!
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:32:09
Hmmm interesting... I'll try a weird amount and see if it works. But I've tried several times... 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:15:38
Nope all transactions are still frozen
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:46:11
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:46:36
3rd one down
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:49:22
"But I'll admit it's enticing that they were working on p2p and keys."
Exactly.. very interesting
