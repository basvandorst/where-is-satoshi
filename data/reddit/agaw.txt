No amount of research could have helped you predict that the price of Bitcoin was going to rise the way it did. 2014 could have happened to you--when Bitcoin dipped and stayed low for years. If an emergency would have happened to you that forced you to sell, it wouldn't have been such a wise move, would it have?
Again, the bottom line is you took a huge risk. Your research didn't help you---you got lucky. Imagine those other people who did the same thing you did, and lost. Were they unwise?

I think before you begin investing in cryptocurrency, you should begin planning a budget to reduce your debt. The longer you're in debt, the more expensive the debt will be to hold. While crypto MAY be able to outpace the interest rate...it's speculative at best and will not help your life if it doesn't work out for you. Focus on what's more important first. If you can barely afford food, you can't afford stocks.

I find your strong hands and dedication to crypto inspiring. My beliefs are in line with yours, so I hope that when the time comes, I can be just as unmoved by the status quo.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:43:55
So you took an incredibly huge risk and it paid off. I'm sorry, but just because you gambled and won does not make it an idiot move. You and your wife would both be singing a very different tune had it not worked out.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:17:20
I believe this is the most likely outcome.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:26:25
Hahahahahahahahaha. I didn't convert my fiat to crypto so I can give them the private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:23:45
One day Bitcoin will be a very usable currency. That's my bet as a hodler.

I guess this is a good wake up call for those of us who still don't understand the concept... The money in your bank is not really your money...it's a debt balance. Put your money in an institution that respects you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:40:53
Agreed. When it becomes part of the national consciousness, something will stick and that will be what it ends up being. My bet is "bit". I mean it only makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:38:46
What do you mean? The employees will hopefully be spending their BTC, circulating throughout the economy and back into companies pockets.

Way too much for me. /conversation from 2013

How did that currency manage to solve the scalability problem?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:14:14
Thank you so much. Exactly what I was looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:41
You...don't need $20k to invest. Buy as much as you're willing to lose, hold, and that's it.

Seriously, how could anyone know what Bitcoin is going to be in 12 months.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:27:36
I wish they would FUCKING VERIFY ME.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:03:09
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:12:48
I welcome fear. Why? Because I actually believe in the technology and many, many of us really believe crypto is here to stay. More fear means more opportunity for the rest of us to consolidate and take the general populous by surprise. Let the FUDers FUD, let the HODLers HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:48:38
Sorry, but you and I are not "on the same team". If at any moment you could make a fortune off of my misfortune, you would, and I could not blame you. If you and I were gold hoarders in early history that did not know each other, the same rules would apply. Hard truth.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:46:44
That's okay. Remember, this is not some get rich quick scheme. In due time you will be happy that you joined this early.

I've heard the term "bits" which seems like it could work in the mainstream.

Currently waiting to be verified so I can buy the dip myself.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:28:29
Just looking for why it could be and why it couldn't be. Not necessarily trying to persuade anyone...just educating myself.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:05:39
Are there really business/individual actors in the world right now accepting relatively large amounts of BTC for goods/products/services, in the dollar-cost of multiple BTC per transaction? What percentage of all the multiple BTC transactions that occur on a daily basis are as actual currency use, and why would they accept Bitcoin for the transaction and not cash?

Any good financial adviser will tell you don't put all of your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:31:35
Spouting anything to anyone about ANY subject you're ignorant of makes you irresponsible, and, in my opinion, an idiot. It's too difficult for people to just admit they don't know something.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:02:20
Good luck with that. It was just a bubble.

Any of his videos? Andreas always asserts that this kind of thing is VERY par the course for something as revolutionary and earth-shattering as decentralized technology and currency. This is very normal and GOOD for the purpose of strengthening Bitcoin.
Here are some tweets:
"Y'all seem surprised that centralizers be centralizing.
If that scares you, perhaps you didn't really believe in the value and resilience of decentralization."
"Chill out everyone. Nothing of any substance has changed. Just a bunch of new drama, which you should ignore."

I beg for something like this to happen. PLEASE.

I'm partial to Electrum, as are a lot of us.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:17:01
Coinbase is NOT decentralized and the continued used of centralized exchanges will result in this kind of market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:41:29
I'm willing to pay at least... three times that much.

Mining is almost guaranteed to not run a good enough BTC over time to be profitable for you with one computer. It takes thousands of dollars and many many computers. You should be reading the sidebar instead of asking the subreddit completely blind what you should be doing right now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:38:37
I'm referring to "the owner sold it" and "definitely a scam". 12 seconds on Google would dispel that kind of ignorance.

While I agree this post is garbage, I also classify any posts that are just numbers being thrown around without any sources/articles also garbage. I.e. Your post.

What a bullshit answer. He just wants to know if you think it is and why.
