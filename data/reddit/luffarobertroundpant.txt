I’m an idiot...I was still in bed and wasn’t thinking.
**Edit:** So I know this needs a better explanation than "I'm an idiot", so here we go:
A little background.  I've been into crypto since BTC was about $20.00.  I've obviously had the opportunity to become filthy rich but have never been smart about it.  In the beginning, I treated BTC as currency and bought stuff from Black Arrow miners (yes, another mistake)to RaspberryPis.
It starts off with being under a continuous and overwhelming amount of stress.  It has affected me in not thinking clearly and making poor decisions.  Even mid-day...it really fucks with me.
So I woke up early in bed and couldn't get back to sleep before work.  I'm sure my alcohol consumption also attributes to my poor sleeping and judgment, so yeah theirs that too.....ooof.
I'm laying in bed...just woke up and found this [post]( on r/space where I saw the twitter post by "Elon Musk".  I don't twitter so I wasn't aware of the scam and Oprah gives out cars, why not Elon?  Still not awake, I did the whole .5 at once.  Anyone in their right mind would have done way way way less or NONE AT ALL being realistic about the situation.  What an idiot....I knew deep down it wasn't true and even thought, "if it's too good to be true..." at the time but did it anyway and I don't know why.  The poor English in the post, the url...all the signs are there but I did not listen to them.
Probably one of the worst mistakes in my life to date.

That's correct.  I'm honestly so ashamed of myself.

What can I say, I feel like an idiot on many levels.

For sure a lesson I will always remember.  I will save it back, but ultimately I feel deeply embarrassed and ashamed for my judgment in the matter.  The anguish of being so ignorant and idealistic is far worse than the monetary loss.    Thank you for the kind words.

Thanks you, but I cannot accept.  I TipBot’ed away far to many BTC on my main account (obviously using a throwaway now) before BTC went toward the moon.  Respectfully, how can I return your tip back  to you?

After reading this, does that mean this person got 3 other idiots?!
