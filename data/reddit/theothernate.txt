This is aladeen for bitcoin.

To be specific, bitcoin is dangerous to **their vision of** society, which coincidentally includes them at the top and in control.
Andreas Antonopolis has a great presentation regarding this. (oldie but goodie)

Thanks for this! I hadn't seen them in a while, and didn't know they were doing this crypto cone stuff.
I used to watch them a lot... never followed their health advice, either, but they're so funny.

disclaimer: I can't take credit for finding this... someone in r/news did the footwork.

I really don't need anymore reasons to dislike this guy, but he just keeps delivering.

Indeed. "Trust but verify."
From the previous Congressional hearings, it looks as if some of them are accepting that this is inevitable, and we should be prepared rather than bury our collective head in the sand. That being said, there WILL be a battle, but let us hope that everyone's greed overpowers the authoritarians that would attempt to stifle innovation.

The first paragraph of the bill...


Not sure of all the details of the legalese, but to my untrained eye, it sounds pretty good to me.

Last night. I used the Moon ([paywithmoon.com]( Chrome plugin to pay over the Lightning Network to Amazon. It was fast... no waiting for confirmations, etc. You can also just have it use your Coinbase account, but I wanted to try Lightning.
I did setup my own Bitcoin Core node, and an Eclair wallet for Lightning, so it required a bit of technical knowledge, but now that it's set up, I can make minor purchases with Amazon very easily.
It's not the final end game of just paying directly with BTC, end-to-end, but it could be the beginning of getting the masses into BTC.

Maybe for many of the 3rd world unbanked people, but I suspect an significant overlap with the "un-interneted" demographic, as well.

Upvote for Kelly's Heros qoute.

Lol. I just watched that, as well.

Exciting to see, and even more exciting that they want to learn... but just in a few seconds they demonstrate how much misinformation there is out there.

Definitely a capable candidate, although to state the obvious, I'd love to see Andreas step up.

Amazon via Moon ([paywithmoon.com]( you can use Coinbase wallet or your own lightning wallet.
