Well, I'm far, and I do mean far more right than mere Trump, but I know for a fact Trump is doing pro-European things with certain civic-nationalistic tendencies, which I think may prove useful. He's got a good heart, and he is a good man. It's worth mentioning that he's not a disgusting pervert unlike the establishment he's butting heads with. And what you call revolution, I'd have to say is just mild revolution. It's wishful thinking to imagine that we could maintain nice society with nice living standards and defeat the evil Big Brother. I'm sorry to say that it's going to be maximally bloody. Very likely World War 3 level. But it's much better that such a conflict has to take place than to submit to perpetual slavery in my opinion. God speed, brother.

Yes, I am sucking in the gut, taking a deep breath, and letting out a good long "NIIIIICE."
It's always a tiny little bit of psychological annoyance to see your healthy pile of resources dip a bit, but like you said, it's good. It's freaking natural. Growing pains is all. And I'm hoping that it will dip just a bit while longer before another growth spurt so I'll be in nice tidy time to get a juicy loan which I will wisely invest (with leverage strategy, mind you, to cover for possible nastiness), then Bitcoin has my permission to continue it's race for the moon.

I may have 2400 USD less than I did a few days ago, but to me that's a shrug and an "eh?", since that's less than half of the profits I've made with bitcoin since I started out a couple months ago. I'm like this porg from Star Wars:

Regardless, people lacking common sense with investment piss me off.

That's a bit of a fallacy in and of itself. The absolute bubble. Either it will go to the moon or it will crash to zero. That's also how people seem to think of rich and poor. It's a pretty huge spectrum. And in the short time that I've been into bitcoin, it has doubled. And the people I know that have the most worldly wisdom plus insight into crypto currencies have very few negative predictions to make about the future of crypto currencies. Now, I'm not the kind of guy that would put a 100 000 all at once into the currency. I'd put perhaps 80% that I'd sneak in over a period of time in case it'd be a bad time to invest. And should it crash terribly, once it does, I'd have more to invest in case it will go back up, but I'd always keep a tidy sum outside as leverage. Plus with what I already got invested, I'm carefully minding the possibility of getting hacked so I won't screw up on that front either. If you make smart moves with your cryptocurrency investments, as a long time holder, you're very likely to reach a good enough moon. Good enough and sizable enough for you.

September... that ought to be around the time I got on as well. I held. And right this minute we're experiencing a little bubbling going on, like in november. Before it just went down, my savings had pretty much doubled, and I'm holding it. I might be a bit more active of a trader if I had more than I do on sites like bitfinex, but eh. I'm more fond of vaults for safety. It'll just have to go through a bit of turbulence. And should bitcoin sink to a fourth of its value, I'll merely be psyched to do some more investment as it has gone sorta low once more. One of the most important bits of magic with Bitcoin is TRUST. The more people there are that believe in it, trust in it, the more it will rapidly grow until it finally evens out and become more like regular currency. It's early still and has a lot more growing until it evens out as evening out would mean mainstream acceptance and at that point it would have grown by... well, why don't you do the math? Three years ago people had the chance to become multimillionaires with the stuff. Same two years ago. Same one year ago. Same a couple months ago. What about three months from now? One year? When will it crash down to zero? When will it burst so bad it'll go down to like 800 dollars? Will it grow to become mainstream and even out? Whichever goes, I'm gonna apply some smart enough investment strategies to only be hit pretty damned hard by a total collapse, but it won't be a death blow. I sorta trust good old Bitsie to do me a solid for long enough.

Ah. Well, I'm used to the profane jungle of the internetz so it felt more likely to presume I was it! Hey, I am rather quite folksy in the good old wholesome Dixie fashion. But yeah, I'm gonna play cryptocurrency nice and wreckless. You know, part of me is starting to wonder if a pretty damn big part of not screwing up investments is being calm and calculating when things spike up or drop sharply. I mean it's not like I've sat through a 3/4th Bitcoin drop, but to a lot of people these drops are scary enough. The sharpest drops I've seen, I guess at my worst I've felt mild annoyance? Maybe said a bad word? Just maintain contact with the wiser inner voice that isn't based on the flinching reflex and instinct, but act with more disciplin, with instincts based in your best logical estimations of how the market may go. And I mean I'm a newbie with trying to figure out any kind of stock chart, but it goes good. I know part of that is that it's easy to be a winner in the bullish economy, but I gotta say I very much approve of the hodl attitude. That's usually best if you lose a bit of focus from time to time.

Well guess what. I take a loan. I invest most of that into cryptoids. Most of the cryptoids will be Bitcoin. I will start pouring some of my outside loan money in as it crashes heavily, but keep plenty still outside covering my ass. And say it just keep on going down. Well, I tiny amount of real estate that can absolve me of my loan. Worst case scenario, I lose some living space. And I don't sweat easily when things get rough. I'm born to hold.
Oh, and suicide? That's not an option. I am only a vehicle for the genetics I possess. It is my holy duty to keep these genetics from being erased. And that's part of my mission. Can't foster a huge family without huge capital these days. So I'm not driven by some BS goal of hedonistic selfishness towards riches. You know that Charles Dance "Tywin Lannister" on Game of Thrones? That's a good visual of what I aspire to.

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:30:50
Most of the greatest truths that I've manage to find about the world resides in quite simple things. There's all kinds of complex structures guarding all manner of lies, and such honest and simple truths that are combated by trillion dollar industries. That's why I don't mind taking such a simple approach to Bitcoin, looking at its resumé. How has it been going thus far, and how did it deal with its harsh times? I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that it'll pull another rabbit or two out of its hat while I'm in the game. I realize there are no guarantees but I'm willing to put my ass on the line for these odds. I like these odds. And should I fail and fail miserably, I'll have no regrets because should I have an identical chance on something a second time around, I'd go for that as well. And if I fail, I accept responsibility. I'm done blaming other people and the world for my own problems. The quality of life for anyone born in a decent enough situation can oftentimes be measured by our own making.

Every penny. And Bitcoin will have to sink by a lot to even reach the level of where I entered. But see, as they say, only invest what you're willing to lose. Not like I had horded a large sum of savings, unfortunately, but you know, it's a nice start. Good thing there's such a thing as loaning money, eh? That's where the real gains are at, bru. And don't worry. I invest strategically, which is why so far I haven't been losing any. People who are more faint at heart when it comes to handling money, I'd be the first to advice them against what I'm doing. In the end, it's just numbers. The magic of altering those numbers are all yours. The kind of person that doesn't sweat it, that is mindful, has the disciplin to hold, that has good enough instincts otherwise, and with larger purposes in life than hoping to get rich enough to buy some hedonistic sports car or whatever, yeah I'd advise a person like that to jump start their finances by doing some big bets with their savings, if they are confident in the investment.

Ah, but it's easier to do your side of the argument than mine. From your side of things you'll always be right because there's no time frame, so it's just whatever time it takes for you to be right. Whenever in the future that Bitcoin dwindles from being relevant into being a novelty at best, like how we look back at altavista, if at that point you feel smug, then I'll bring you back to earth with a well placed kick in the groin. My estimation is not Bitcoin to the moon eternal, my estimation is a bunch of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin will be successful enough for enough amount of time for a guy like me to grow capital at a ridiculous rate, presuming you don't flinch at the bumpiness of the ride. So a couple of years from now when I'm a millionaire, I intend to not be smug. If on the other hand I miscalculate and end up losing money on my gameplan, then you may do me a solid with a well placed kick in the groin.

The Road so Far:
Eh. Just sorta put all my savings from my daytime job that I've been working half a year into bitcoin. And I managed to accidentally do so right as Bitcoin went up big-league. It grew by about a third. Since I got more paychecks coming, I only sorta kinda worry about whether it will come crashing down because if it does, well that just means bitcoin will be all that much cheaper to buy.

The feck? What fascist tendencies? I'm a fascist myself and let me tell you, Trump has none. He's a civic nationalist boomer. He doesn't care about the stuff that your atypical white nationalist, national socialist, fascist like me cares about. He's all about bringing back wealth into the country, and he doesn't care about race. His stances on Mexican illegals and their criminality is simply because that threat is so big as to be on an existential level, something not shared with the minority blacks of the country. If the blacks had been as big of a threat, he'd have said the same thing about them. Trump is a businessman that wants the average Joe to get some successes to and have a decent living. He has no commonality with the dictators through history everybody is so afraid of. In fact when Castro died, Trump and Pence were the only ones saying truthful bad stuff about him. Even Putin was calling Castro a remarkable leader.
