If the exe is replaced, you'll get an error when you try and validate the signature file against the exe, as that won't be the exe that was signed.

That hash matches theymos' hash:


I don't know if electrum posts a list of hashes anywhere. If you've verified the signature file against the exe file, then you are probably safe.

You would have to transfer the Bitcoin off the exchange and into your own wallet, which you keep the private keys to stored offline.

We cannot know for sure what the topology of the lightning network will be in the real world until it launches. If it turns out to be extremely centralized, decentralists will have to look to other ways of scaling. LN is a layer on top of the existing system, it's use is optional.

We can only speculate on how the LN will turn out. I would be surprised if at the very least it doesn't turn out to be more decentralized and have lower transaction fees than Bcash and would be useful for that group of users, so at least some people would have use for it.
If LN does turn out to be centralized, pure decentralists will have to look to other ways of scaling long-term. Personally I am very intrigued by the work being done by the [MimbleWimble developers]( and hope that MimbleWimble or some form of cut-through could be added to Bitcoin as a second layer if the idea works out. But if LN turns out to be centralized and there are no other viable options, perhaps cryptocurrencies are inherently centralized when operated at large scales and perhaps there is no way of keeping a cryptocurrency decentralized other than keeping it small.
