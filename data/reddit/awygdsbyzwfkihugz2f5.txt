Not unless that pesky FBI stops shutting down those druggie online shops

Buying more when the price drops? Isn't that what I just said?

Except the $20 I earned in 2017 isn't worth $4 now lmao. Do you know what literally means? Are you sure you're not cherry picking bits you like and being idealistic?

It's the banking-commercial complex. Obiously they are scared of bitcoins potential. Only paid shills could deny the fact that BTC is about to go to the moon after hitting the true floor.

It's a picture and it's got reddit gold. You need to listen and believe.

Didn't he say Japan basically deserved the tsunami for being sinners and atheists?
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:32:07
Oh they keep buying as the price drops? Wow if you say the big guys are doing that it must be a smart strategy! Keep buying as the price drops guys!

I love his predictions too! So much positivity and stuff that means I get money. Let's all hold hands in a big circle and believe in the power of bitcoin until we self-actualize our true earning potential.

Pushing the price down by buying massive amounts of bitcoin? I guess I don't have enough invested to force myself to believe that. How deep in the red are you pal?

Woah now, just because he's not trustworthy enough to work in markets that are actually regulated doesn't mean he would *lie* just to manipulate the price of a coin for some profit at other peoples expense. How could you have so little trust? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:13:33
Ok I will buy when it's a fraction of a penny per bitcoin then because it's always been higher than that

number fourteen. wall street foot lettes. you wouldn't like to get your bit coin and have someone elses foot funges on it[.](

Love the fact that this comment got downvoted.
How dare you point out that is bad reasoning! Come on hun let's all be positive until our dreams come true. Don't be a neg-ferret. Just smile and clap until btc goes to the moon!
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:49:44
Just keep buying more and more as the price drops of course! If it gets to 0 there is infinite earning potential!
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:18:01
Oh yeah that's dead simple. All you need to know is  what is really high and what is really low, depending on what way the price goes. All you need to do is predict the future price movements. Dead simple, can't go wrong. Works on roulette just as well too. lmao
