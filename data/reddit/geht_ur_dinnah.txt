Thank you, Paper Wallets seem like a good route. Although I trust their parents financially- they won't steal it- I am more worried about keeping it safe for them for 10+ years. Maybe laminated and placed in a safe deposit box?   
I'm sure your godson will be thankful :)

I wholeheartedly agree with Tales from the crypt. A recent episode with Alex Gladstien I think you will find especially great- it goes into all the good Bitcoin can enable in the world- censorship resistance so its a great piece to bring us back to the roots of the technology and why we should support it as much as we can. Additionally another episode to TFTC with Jack Dorsey is a classic, Jack DOrsey (CEO of twitter) does a great job of explaining why he believes the technology spread of bitcoin is inevitable. A final TFTC I will rec ( as the appetizer for the series) is the one with CASA founder Jeremy Welch, good intro to Lightning network and what CASA enables but also Jeremy is clearly in it for philisophical reasons so hearing those are also illuminating.   
Masters in business Podcast also had an episode with the Wilklevoss twins that was alright, I don't really like his interview style but that epsiode was pretty good.   
Gonna be saving this post so I can get some more as well.

Good thought for a friend to use now but if this is ten years in the future will the backup seed work if that particular wallet doesn't exist anymore?

Teach them the current monetary system or the future one? ;)   
I am just joking, I understand your point- Yes having them understand how money should be handled is an important skill.
