autopilot is okayish. You can have better results by manageing your channels manualy. Connect to shops (lightningnetworkstores.com), one or two meganodes and  some smaller nodes with high availability (low score on 1ml.com). About 10+ channels should be enough to get your node a good reach through the network.

1) You can just manually open as many channels as you like. Autopilot stops opening channels as soon as a limitation from the config (maxchannels, minchannelsize...) is hit.
2) lncli feereport
You can earn a few satoschis per week, but electricity cost will be higher. With the node you can learn a lot about linux, networks and Bitcoin. And you can instantanously feed a bunch of chickens :-)

You are right, it's risky and undermines privacy but: all successful messengers (telegram, signal, whatsapp, threema) automatically search your mobile addressbook. 
A mobile number to bitcoin address lookup service, maybe even with a btc-address field patch for your phones contacts is a nessecary step to mass adoption.
You can still keep you main wallet private.

There was a small price increase. In those times memes may be more in demand than tech articles.

one step closer to the solution! try chown /mnt/hdd/bitcoin 'username'
i'm not an expert, but it is supposed to be more secure to run bitcoind and everything in general as a non admin user. I usually make a sudo user, set stuff up and then remove sudo privileges.
edit: maybe chown - R for recursive folders...
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:05:30
'htop' shows all running processes
ctrl+c exits
'bitcoind -daemon' starts bitcoind in the background
'bitcoin-cli stop' stops bitcoind

Shango wallet works flawless for lightning (send and receive) and on chain transactions at the moment.
(node lnd)

BtcPayServer needs a bunch of different tools to work. you'll need a blockchain scanner, a sql database, a Microsoft run time thing, a webserver in addition to bitcoind and c-lightning or lnd which all need to be configured to work with each other. 
I gave up after 3 hours trying to set up everything manually. It's also not recommended on their website to set up everything by hand. 
There is a docker image.
@_date: 2019-10-23 08:31:33
you can run a btcpayserver from any computer you like. there is nothing custodial about it. you can even send your shops earnings directly to you ledger nano s. Setting it up at home takes longer than 5 minutes though.

Where do you get the circulating supply info from?

I have a ledger nano s, but i also like paperwallets. I'm quite sure each wallet uses a different dictionary to connect the recovery phrases to numbers. when your software wallet is discontinued in 10 years you may be forced to find an old pc and a cd with windows 10 to run your wallet. but actually i never tried using a recovery phrase from i. a. jaxx in electeum. I'm just sure it won't work.

I can't see a reason why $ should stabilize. - 10% since your new president. 
If bitcoin just kept its value it would be enough. I don't need no moon.

so no bitcoins for the unbanked. that's sad.

I created a second user, gave him admin rights, installed everything and then planned to remove admin priveleges from this user.
But i got stuck with a go cache something error while installing lnd and found no dokumentation about it. so i never finished.
It's just running a full node, the daedalus ada wallet and pi-hole for a month now.
weekly updates are also recommended.

recieving 500 satoshi per email you get and spending 500 sat per email you write would solve all spam issues.
We need a lightning mail client!

Thanks for the reply.
I just updated some minutes ago.
GO111MODULE=on go install -v ./... did not work for me. produced some go modules not found error.
so i just used 'go build' and then 'make &amp; &amp; make install'

I just don't see it.  [mempool.space]( shows less than 2 mb and lower than 7 tx/s. A few weeks ago there were 30 mb of transactions waiting even at US-nighttime.

Some of those youtubers were really entertaining with occasional good perspectives. Naturally for every talent there are many without talent trying to be youtoubers anyway. BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT! 
Youtube wiped out a whole subculture in one swipe. 
Hopefully it was just a troll group reporting falsly on all the cryptotubers they knew (just english ones) and some automated switch off response triggered to getting i. e. 20 reports per hour on a channel.

Is there a easy way to install the update? Using LND 5.2 on mint-linux. i'm so planless i could use a step by step copy&amp;paste guide.

I'd like to see lightning powered email fees. this could solve all spam problems. If someone is willig to pay me 10c for recieving his spam, send more. there can still be spam filters on top.

I wish I knew. Did the same thing with my old XBMC/Kodi minipc. I have no talent and no interest for the Linux command line! So i am stuck with this installation instructions: [
There seems to be a graphical user interface for LND. Eclair worked easy in Win10. But I want a more stable and secure lubuntu system. I copied some securitymeasures from the "Thundroid" guide: Uncomplicated firewall and file2ban, hope that is enough.
Maybe you can just use the synaptic package manager?

There are open source projects like openatv for a variaty of DVB-S recievers. This recievers usually have big enough HDDs for the blockchain and a internetconnection. A lot of this 'old' sat-recievers are going to be thrown out when 4k pushes away HD. 
They could live on as additional nodes.  But there is a recurring discussion if more nodes really improve the network. The whole satellite thing is for the love of tinkering with new stuff. I can't see any immediate advantages.

It was explained to me that you don't send your private keys to a bitcoin node for a transaction. A hash is generated locally on your device, which can be validated and that hash gets send out to the network. you can use one address multiple times.
The Jaxx feature is more for privacy.

I try to make a third of my channens to nodes smaller than 1 btc with a high  uptime. Another third goes to merchants, because thats where the sats are flowing to. The rest of my channels connects to the big nodes to get a good network coverage. 
But the big nodes don't really need you for routing, you need three or four of them to get good connectivity for your spending. Incoming liquidity comes with time. My node is two months old and every week or two someone opens a channel by chance.
Why should someone connect to a small node with 5 channels which themself just connect to the big nodes, instead of connecting the the big nodes directly? To make your node look tasty you don't need to be  homungusly huge but have just a hand full of well funded (&gt;100$) channels to medium nodes on the same continent. 
Also lower your fees! Someone routed 300.000 sats through my node and got charged 600sat on the preconfigured lnd standard. That is more than i'd pay for an on-chain transaction! (lncli updatechannelpolicy 0 0.00001 144)
