These are the right reasons to support Bitcoin and similar endeavors. But not necessarily enough to justify investment for speculative purposes. And the money coming in now.. well, a lot of it is for speculative purposes.

I haven't used Gox in a long time... not that I think they are untrustworthy or anything, but I didn't do much trading. Just bought and held. I know my friend doesn't use them much either, not since they had all their problems this year.

Averaging it out, ~$1030s

that's probably a more reasonable idea than a tattoo.

Bitcoins might be relatively new, but investing and speculating are old games.

"Bitcoin is like buying shares into the internet"
no offense, but this is exactly the kind of talk that makes me comfortable with exiting.

Ideas.. as in bitcoin-related ventures? Definitely more interesting than simply speculating on the price.

I think it has already succeeded. That's precisely why I sold!

thank you!

I don't know how many coins one would need to be considered a bigger player, but my friend had about $20k invested @ at avg price of $5/btc, then added monthly throughout 2012. He wasn't an early miner, just an investor.

Thanks! And luck to you as well!

invested $5k @ $13 a coin
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:29:52
thanks! likewise.

See, that's the problem. You can't put a price on something that can't be bought or sold. Like the internet. It is literally priceless. Comparing bitcoin to the internet in general just doesn't work. 
As for massive potential..  going from pennies to over a thousand bucks? You're right. Massive potential, a great deal of it has already realized. Sure, it can theoretically go up to say, $100k per coin, but what's going to happen before then? Wallet security, network security... not to mention, governments don't like giving up control of their financial systems. From the zombie banks of Japan, to the need for QE in times of recession... there are so many potential obstacles that shouldn't be ignored.

Nope, it is just different. It has its strengths and weaknesses. Bitcoin isn't worth anything more than the fiat you can get for it.
