By this logic, every value judgment in the space is an ‘attack’. Let’s be real - people are going to make assessments in this space, honest or otherwise. Let us sort through the mess and seek the most valid.

Ohh I thought it was an acronym

How can it be both a fungible currency token and a scarce store of value?
Edit: scare&gt;scarce

I’m just confused as to how it achieves both increasing value through volatility AND currency replacement through high speed and low cost. If the price continues to trend (relatively) rapidly upwards there is no currency adoption model as there is no incentive to spend.

The thing I don't understand in this market: why would anybody liquidate 100%? Why not keep 10% aside and check back in a few years?
