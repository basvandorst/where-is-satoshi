I wasn’t talking about whether its right or wrong to deplatform Alex Jones in a free society, I’m just pointing out that his deplatforming does not serve as evidence for his dumb conspiratorial claims.

I’ll explain it one more time. I’m going to break it down as simply as possible for you.
Alex Jones, in a rant, claimed that the government is purposefully using a chemical to turn frogs gay and also implied that they are putting the chemical in our water (to turn people gay I assume).
This claim comes from connecting two unrelated facts.
1. The US Airforce requested money in 1994 to create a bomb that would cause people to have sex with each other. The pentagon denied their request.
2. A chemical exists that causes male frogs to change sexes and mate with other male frogs. (Which, considering that the frogs’ actual biological structure changes, isn’t even gay.)
My argument: There is no evidence to suggest the government is purposefully using a chemical to turn frogs or people gay.
Your argument: No, there actually is a chemical that turns frogs gay. (I left out your smug “simple search” part.)
No one is disputing that, so you’ve really brought nothing to the conversation.
The fact that the chemical exists does not provide any evidence for Alex Jones’ claim that the government is using it to turn frogs and people gay.

Lol. Private companies deplatforming Alex Jones makes claims like “the government is purposefully using chemicals to make frogs gay” more valid.

The 3 facts you listed are still bringing nothing new to the conversation. You’re just providing more information about unrelated facts. You haven’t shown any proof that the government is putting the chemical in any water on purpose. You could cite a 100 page peer reviewed study on how a chemical causes frogs to change sexes and Alex Jones’ claim that the government is using it against ordinary people or frogs is still just dumb conspiratorial conjecture.
Later man

Cool, I’m not denying the validity of there being a chemical that actually has an effect on frogs.
This is what Alex Jones does. He takes two facts: the existence of a chemical that causes frogs to change sexes and the 1994 request for money by the US Airforce to make a bomb that causes sexual activity (which was immediately denied btw). Then he connects those facts in an unhinged rant to suggest the government is purposefully turning frogs gay. 
That’s not a valid claim.

Yeah, I agree. I responded before the edit to the original comment.
