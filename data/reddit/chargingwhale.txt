..because then it wouldn't be Bitcoin any more.

What kind of "fair warning"? I didn't use an exchange as my personal wallet, but to do speculation. Let me know where I can do margintrading without counterparty risk, and I'll have a very close look at that.

I will be offline until monday. Horrible timing, I know. But as it goes, we'll probably still be waiting for an update "tomorrow" by then.

Before I sent them Bitcoin, I read up on the team, history and security precautions. It all did sound good to me, especially with that big and public team, zero-hacks-history (heh, right?) and most of all the Armory coldwallet setup.
I didn't pay enough attention to their switch from a hot/cold wallet setup to whatever this was supposed to be.
Why so many funds online? For speculating. As I am long and in a long margin position often, I need securities/funds online. I do &lt;1 leverage, so I need a lot of funds online..

Where do those numbers come from? I would settle with such a proposal, yes.
Edit: if all relevant numbers are published and those 70% are resulting from a fair procedure (tm).

To find other people interested in legal actions, and to get a headstart with information. I am not a lawyer, and honestly I don't have a clear idea who to call to get this thing rolling, should it be necessary.
What do you think would happen if I call a regular local lawyer? He would cost me money and time, if he doesn't faint on the phone right away.

Nope, I'm a permabull, and in 90% of the time I am in a position it's a long.

*Redditor for 3 hours*, better?
I am a well known member of the community. At this point I choose not to disclose my regular account. My favorite outcome would still be that a legal case isn't necessary.
Should it come to a legal case, pretty much all of my info will be public anyway. As soon as there's enough info available I will decide if I will pursue this or not. And will gladly publish my info and put coins in escrow for this.
And no, I'm not asking for trust or funds or whatnot. I ask for other potential victims to combine forces, should it come to this.
