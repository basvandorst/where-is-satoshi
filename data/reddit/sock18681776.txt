you're* 


I don't think about people like you at all.


That's good =] Sounds like a good way to build core confidence and prepare them for the real world.
And in regards to the  hash tag creator, she is a vile beast of burden. Doesn't take much of an IQ to realize she has a vendetta against men.

i financed my house and used my kids college funds (ones 15, the other is 16).
I read on here it'd go to 100k. I just wanted to be rich so bad.
My wife is leaving me, my kids have disowned me. I'm going to be broke for the rest of my life and alone.

You should stop being so lame dude. If you have a daughter she's going to compensate for your total lack of a spine by dating some strong male that you'll feel emasculated by, if you have a son he will resent you for being so weak.


Holy straw man. Not that you'd believe me, but I've most likely gotten laid in this last 3 years more (and by more women) than you have in your entire life. Women want with men who are confident, competent, have strong convictions, and are genuine about said convictions. Every girl I've ever dated  who loved me has eventually adopted my far right politics, regardless of whether they were even "feminists" to begin with. 
I've turned over a new leaf from smashing thots though; sleeping with a ton of women is degenerate, and no measure of what makes someone a man. I have a nice qt young gf who wants to have kids and start a family. People like you that push that dribble are part of the problem.

Yeah well the British Broadcasting Corporation says otherwise for even your own currency. Still wrong.

Thanks bruv =] Hopefully your kids won't be weak ass pushovers who are cool with their political power, culture, and heritage dissolving before their eyes as they are demographically replaced.

It doesn't matter what country you're from; referring to USD by putting the $ sign behind the number is incorrect. You're wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:15:11
Give me your worthless currency then.
