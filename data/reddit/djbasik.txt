I have used the Dencentral BTM a few times. I haven't been by the new location yet. It's a great supportive and friendly place for first time Bitcoin buyers.

Well don't create a web site... ever. Because the idea here is that if you create a website that has users, you are ultimately responsible for what your users do.
I don't get this logic to be honest. If I buy a hammer and use it to kill some one, no one blames the hammer store/company. But if I make a website and other people use my site for bad, its my fault.

You seem to forget that (allegedly) it was cops who baited him into making that decision(I believe he still holds ground that it wasn't him and some one else using the DPR acct. at that time). They convinced him it was his only option. 
It's pretty sad when we try to create criminals, rather than perusing the criminals that we already have.

If I going to toys R Us, buy a big red fire truck toy, beat you over the skull with it. Does Toy R Us get punished?
This crazy ass "SOME ONE MUST PAY" attitude is insane. Adults make decisions, If an adult makes a bad one (in this case do drugs) and dies, unless I specifically did something to cause you to die, sorry it was your fault.

I fail to see how I am a victim of his "crimes".

I agree 100%. They may have other issues and have other controversial business practices but that doesn't lend to the fact that no matter how much money you have, the hacker problem doesn't go away.

You have to realise that, I didn't forget 12K. 
This was back in the early days, I paid 120 for it and probably overpaid.
Over the next 6 months to a year, my interest in Bitcoin had faded, I literally put 0 though about Bitcoin again until I saw the news of a 1000$ BTC. It blew my mind and I rushed around to find a back up of that PC. Unfortunately it was gone.

In that case, we should say goodbye to companies and services such as:
* Sony
* Microsoft
* Ebay
* Home Depot
* Target
* Evernote
* Feedly
* Dominos Pizza
* JP Morgan Chase
* THE US MILITARY - not a joke [\(Source\)](
* Mozilla
* Shall I continue?
* Just for fun I will
* Staples
* Community Health Services
* Have I made my point yet?
There is no amount of money that you can throw at security experts to prevent hackers from getting in 100%. PERIOD.

In Prison?

That's under the assumption that you have the money to spend on extremely expensive talent for security experts. It is a fairly unreasonable assumption that every business in the world has all the money in the world to throw at every single thing they want.
Lets put things into perspective here. Sony, a company that reported over $70 Billion (YEA WITH A B) in revenue in 2014, couldn't protect themselves from hackers.

Did Ross knowingly sell drugs to teens? Do you have a link to the story? I am unfamiliar with this story.

I bought 100 BTC for 120$ back in the day, after about a year of no action in the BTC world I forgot about them junked that PC. They are floating around in a Canadian landfill some where... I cry myself to sleep at night....

I would be more than happy to provide you a website for free. Please PM me if your interested, we can discuss.

There are a few places on King &amp; Queen street in Toronto that take BTC. I see the signs every day on my commute. Mostly restaurants. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:02:13
I know there is a few Asian restaurants in the TIFF/restaurant row area on King. I see big B in the window every day. I haven't ever really looked at the name of the place how ever.

This is a good point. I guess it ultimately comes down to how receptive people are to Bitcoin. Exposure cant hurt. If people keep seeing that logo every where they will being to question it and a certain percentage of those people will look it up. A very small number of those people will actually look further into BTC or maybe even buy some and use them. The idea here is that small gains are gains regardless. It took nearly 2 decades for the internet to really hook in the way we know it today, and it all started with small gains in traction by those who believed in the tech. That wouldn't have happened if every one just said "hey your 10 years to early, why bother".
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:03:35
I would have to strongly disagree. The only way to increase the amount of spending in BTC is for merchants to accept it. The more businesses that accept BTC the more people will use it, more people will question what the logo on the front of a cash register is, more traction BTC gains.
