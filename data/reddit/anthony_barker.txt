VoS is great - account creation and validation can be faster than quickbt. Interac payment doesn't support CIBC or NB though.

They are going after everyone - just not the banks

WU, MoneyGram, Euronet(ria) are the big 3. Margins are about 5% gross. Cash handling and Compliance eat up much of that margin which Bitcoin doesn't fix.
Bitcoin could potentially fix a portion of settlement (swift takes min 3 hours). You would still need to extend it to handle most of the Swift fields as described by iso 20022 
Escrow functions are also very cool. Bitcoin ATMs (in Canada are expensive) and don't solve it.

Most of the poor only have cash. So you either need to get them to have salaries in bitcoin or have tighter bitcoin to cash conversion.

So stock splits are used everywhere - even Berkshire Hathaway came out with B shares which are cheaper. The BTC Market cap stays the same, individual holdings stay the same (if you had 15 BTC -&gt; 1,500 BTC. But psychologically for new investors or users they are cheaper - despite the market cap being the same. you are just in effect changing the decimal point for reporting purposes. It would take the Bitcoin community to simply change the standard what a bitcoin is.
[BKRB vs BKRA volume]( from this you can see volumes in the cheaper "B" shares are 20,000 times higher volume weighted (10 times value weighted). Both provide rights to the company with differing shareholder rights.
I don't think it will happen as it seems most Bitcoin users are wedded to the 21 million number.

Yes - it doesn't matter except for perception.

I you consider bitcoin a thing like trading cards instead of a currency there are a lot. Monet paintings,  bits of land in Manhattan or Hong Kong, or an Ivy League degree?
