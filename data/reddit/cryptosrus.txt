This is another bullish news that helps establish credibility for the cryptocurrency community.  Yale is one of the top schools in the world and they would not be investing in any crypto fund if they weren't sure it is part of the future.  
So many people in cryptos are only in it for the short term gains but fail to realize how big the future is for blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

600% more nodes means nothing.  CSW and his supporters for Bitcoin SV controls well over 50% of the hashing power.  Bitcoin SV is going to become the new Bitcoin Cash.

It's a hard lesson to be learned but it really comes down to having patience.  Too many traders thought Bitcoin was moving too slow because they saw how Ethereum was skyrocketing.  Then they moved in Ethereum only to notice coins like Dash, Monero, Zcash to be skyrocketing.  So they move into them. And so forth on and on.  The same thing happens with ICOs as people are jumping from one to one or to all hoping to strike it rich.  
Keep in mind some of these altcoins stay low for months or years.  Before may of 2017, many coins were few 1000% cheaper.  I held on Litecoin from 2014 when it was around $10 dollars.  From $10 it dropped down to $4 dollars of this year before shooting back up to $60 now.  
If you are going to invest in altcoins, pick the right ones and do it long term.  Don't try to day trade because you'll always be one step behind.  
Right now Bitcoin is the right move before the hardfork as it is pumped hard because of the free '2x' coins people will get from the hard fork.  But afterward be careful, there will be a correction.  If your going to stay in Bitcoin do it long term.  Don't try to trade the ups and downs too much because you never know what might happen from one day to another.

There are a ton around Chicago.  I just don't see the point of Bitcoin ATMs.  People who want to use BTC simply just needs to get a debit card that links up to their wallet.  And mass majority of people who are involved with Bitcoin want to stay anonymous and do not want a camera recording them!

There is no doubt that BTC will hit $5000 soon but how many are going to sell?

Bitcoin will continue to rise until the hard fork happens in Nov with Segwit2x.  A lot of people think Bitcoin Gold is the hard fork coming up Oct 25th and it is not.  No one is supporting Bitcoin Gold.  It would suggest not to invest in altcoins at this point since everyone is liquidating altcoins and putting that money into Bitcoin to get some free '2x' coins.
