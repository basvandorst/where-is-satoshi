That doesn't invalidate his point. If your wallet can be broken into with the help of support, support can break into any wallet. That means the encryption is worthless. If op gets these coins back it means they were never secure in the first place.

We all have our regrets, I'm just glad I got a good story out of it all. The punchline to my bitcoin story is buying in a whole bitcoin when it plummeted to 730 from 1200. 400 may be high enough for me to sell. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:02:50
Which will only grow, which is a huge problem. Bitcoin loses a lot of advantages of you start charging $1 per transaction. Now people would never use it just to pick up a soda, which they do with credit cards.

I'm a CS student and I feel that guy may be off his rocker. I don't think what he is suggesting is completely impossible but it sounds like making it work and making it work elegantly at all would be a PHD thesis, maybe a bit more worth of work.
He also is seemingly suggesting a centralized way of kicking off bad nodes but that might actually be decentralized, either way it's a really bad way of going about the whole thing. The problem is that folding isn't like a cryptographic hash. If I want to try to send you a fake hash to prove I did some work, you can very, very (very) quickly see that the work I made up is bullshit and reject it. I don't know much about folding but it isn't a hashing function. Verifying bad work is probably more cumbersome and that's why this guy thinks it is necessary to kick off people that are trying to send in BS work rather than just ignore them. In BTC, it is extremely cheap to ignore the trolls/scammers. In folding it would be very expensive so he wants a crazy data mining/machine learning/human hybrid to verify that work is good and ban those who are sending in bad stuff.
Seems like insanity to me.

I'm not an expert so I can't explain very well. Here's a reddit thread where they discuss unlicense.
It sounds like the short and the long of it is that you won't get screwed but you aren't actually making it as permissive as possible. Lots of countries don't have the concept of Public Domain so in those countries you are still the copyright holder and anyone using your stuff is technically infringing on your copyright. MIT is the most permissive of the "standard" licenses.
You might also like to look here,  though I've not used it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:45:53
Yeah, I realized after the fact.
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:55:18
Ahh that's interesting, so you can hop on and get paid either to mine the coin directly or to do folding?
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:38:36
Which would have a very, very long lasting effect on the price.
That makes more sense, the claim that the price would effortlessly bounce back seemed utterly mad to me. How is it that people would be willing to pay $600 for something that was for sale for only $5 the day before?

Why wouldn't the bounty hunters keep the coins for themselves?

I used to mine with dual 8800s, pulling in a coin every other day. It was at like 2 to 3 dollars each when I started, barely covering electrical costs. I sold when it soared up to 20 then stopped mining. It honestly never even crossed my mind that bitcoin could have actual value at the time. I was right for a while too. It crashed the next week back to 5,which is when I really wrote it off. Took a long while for it to stabilize over 30. I ran the calculation once and if I kept mining and sold near the peak, I'd likely have made in the ballpark of 100K. Silly me. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:16:00
It's actually been crashing super hard this month because multi-pools discovered a vulnerability in the block reward randomization routine. It's been patched, but they haven't recovered from that yet.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:15:28
Yes but it's pointless to calculate that into ROI because if you were planning on it going up, you are better off putting your money into directly buying BTC.
Almost all of the first generation ASIC miners ended up making back 3-4x their initial investment, but they would have made 10x is they just bought BTC with what they spent on their ASICs.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:48:27
They are intentionally heavily anonymized. It depends what you mean by shady but they certainly aren't trustworthy. The folks who run it could be perfectly fine dudes that just want a good exchange but they could also be con artists just waiting for their wallets to hit the magic number before taking it all. Nobody can know because nobody knows who they are.
Don't leave coins on exchanges. They aren't yours unless you are the only know with access to the private key.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:27:10
You're really, really arrogant.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:48:12
That is being realized in most of the big BTC businesses. For example, if Coinbase starts stealing, the people who are responsible will go down in flames.
It's a mixture of the fact that it's still so new that there isn't much competition and the nature of BTC. People use BTC-e because it is one of the best exchanges out there at the moment. If there was a better one without an anonymous person/people running it, then people would use that one.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:02:20
I actually had this conversation with a professor a few days back. Me and some other students brought up bitcoin and one of them said they owned .1 bitcoin and the professor was confused why you could own a tenth of a coin. He knew about bitcoin but he thought that the coin was the lowest denomination because that's what it is like in physical currencies.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:53:41
How so?
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:28:47
I researched this a few months back when I had the same idea for a coin. It's completely centralized and the "mining" mechanism is pretty weird and sketchy. You basically hook up this folding application to be part of a team and the coin creator can see that you're folding on there and give you coins.
Not the worst thing in the world but definitely not your standard cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:38:30
So what is it you're trying to do? You gamble that there will be others buying in to pay for you?
It is a pretty cool little idea, not one I would get in on though.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:51:48
If that were worth 80K the market cap of BTC would be in the trillions which a'int hannenin'.

So, we trade around monopoly money that is supposed to act like gox coins so that when we inevitably hack the old gox DB and get access to the coins we can redistribute to those with the monopoly money coins we gave out?
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:59:12
But how could we possibly know what it was? Btc-e doesn't do any press releases and even if they did we would have no idea if they were lying to cover their asses or not.
Anonymity is really bad for an exchange. You *want* someone who is responsible for if things go south.

It's really poorly publicized just how much of a possibility this is. They're anonymous, nobody has any idea who runs that exchange. If they decide they want to run with the coins, that's that.
Sure would tank the price and confidence in BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:05:36
Should diversify more than that I think. Some in BTC, some in LTC, maybe even a bit in something like Doge.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:39:36
They aren't taking buy orders on Coinbase at the moment. They are deferring to letting you put in money now and have it buy at the price on Friday. Very much lame, I was hoping to get in at this super low price but Coinbase is my only way to buy in.

@_date: 2014-03-04 14:46:46
That's how I feel, LTC will always be the silver to BTCs gold. People won't actually buy stuff with BTC in the future but it will always have trading value.
People like doge because the numbers are actually satisfying. As it stands, if you want to send someone $1 worth of LTC you still have to send like 0.05 or so LTC. Doge is way more fun in that you send literally hundreds at a time! It sounds silly but this is actually a massively important point. We're humans and we don't like using numbers we can't think of in our heads or that we haven't seen used much before.

Used to, now it doesn't. Multipools were predicting when a block would be good or bad and jumping on or off based on how much the next block reward would be. Very bad for poor shibes.

So how do you suggest we go about deciding what is worth paying taxes for and what isn't? Perhaps some sort of governmental structure wherein people could vote for what they want to be taxed on or not.

So when you buy in you know that the money you are paying it being given out to those before you in hopes that there will be another round (and hopefully many rounds) after you to pay you?
So if you happen to be in the last round before the scheme collapses, you lose everything?
That's interesting.

@_date: 2014-02-25 02:20:23
This is exactly correct. It's worth noting that there are a ton of systems for people getting paid in BTC off of a donation wallet for working on open source software and WhisperSystems has one of the deepest pockets. $15/commit is really, really high for working on open source software. Most of the other piece of software you'll make at most a buck or two.

If this whole thing really does seriously take off, I think Litecoin will also be used. For daily purchases I really doubt that people would be happy with buying things for 100 mBTC.
I think it will be the silver to BTC's gold.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:36:21
Alternatively they think that they might be able to drive the price down if the word gets around that Bitcoin has a bug in it and they can cash out on that.

For the network it is the best thing to have as many full bitcoin-qt clients with ports open and mining rigs as possible. So yeah, get to mining if you want to help the network.
The vast majority aren't all that concerned with the health of the network though and are in this for profit.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:54:05
Doesn't look like it. It got most of its coins back in 2011 when getting tens of thousands of BTC was relatively easy (still a pretty sizable investment). It's held them and not moved since then besides random people sending a few mBtc while begging over the years.
A mixer would be taking in an putting out constantly. It would be much more active. Unless of course this is some really paranoid person that has a bunch of really sketchy coins and they waited to get the heat down on them, but that also seems really unlikely.
