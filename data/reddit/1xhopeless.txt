Leave it up. If MODs think it is against the rule they'll take it down.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:39:28
This sound like some sort of achievement! 
I will put your name in my will in case I get struck by lightening  so that you can fight and withdraw the BTC I have in the tipbot. (I cant do anything with it as it is below the min...:))
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:54:23


No it isn't. Unless you are a speculator using BTC as a commodity to buy it and sell it for $/£ instead of using it as a currency (which it is) to buy stuff and services  without selling it to fiat.

TROLL ALERT! 20 days old redditor trying to stir up sh!t!! 
Boring move on,
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:02:01
How is it possible to use this to transfer $/£ to someone else. How can they get their money and withdraw it. Someone pls explain. thx
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:56:33
BTC giveaway!!  Well done for doing that!
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:47:14
You posted this non sense 4 times so far and you where told **NO**.
What about having you in the ring and have both communities beat the cr out of you!!!
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:13:20
Wohoo!! Thank you very much. Very kind of you and thanks for the link.
Edit: just wondering. no disrespect to anyone, are you the only one allowed to tip on this subreddit?
@_date: 2014-05-09 11:13:48
Thank you very much very generous of you. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:04:15


Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:37:27
So you don't like a friendly subs. Are you missing all the nasty trolls and speculators that infested this place for years.
Get in the spirit.Sorry don't have or hold any btc. Don't spend it all on sweets :) +dogecar verify
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:37:59
The issue with BTC as a currency is that very few speculators (not the true Bitcoiners) have a lot of it. Now that the value have dropped they can spread the BTC to new users by tipping them. 
This way you prevent the same thing happening to BTC again and you acquire new users that will treat it as a currency instead of wondering about its price vis a vis $/£...
Most of Dogecoin shibes received their Doge through tipping and they use it to tip, buy stuff, donate and are not bothered about it's price hence the annoying (for speculators) slogan 1doge = 1doge.
Spread you BTC around...
@_date: 2014-05-09 09:35:14
Wow thank you very much.

@_date: 2014-05-16 23:56:58


Until the last 2 or 3 days I have never seen a BTC giveaway or tip. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:15:45
American stupidity at its best. On the day Russia declares that crypto currencies are not illegal and free to use. 
Carry on stifling businesses in the US with your red tapes and regulation. 
Don't register a crypto business in the US, they are worst than the old USSR. The land of the free!!!!! my ass. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:55:45
Did say that few weeks ago after a journey around reddit crypto communities that ended here.
The real bitcoin guys don't really speak up and leave the late greedy comers to be the first to spit poison and hostile comments and tarnish their reputation. Had plenty of very positive PMs but few are happy to leave a reply for everyone to see (although I did get tipped my first BTC tip for my comment). Last comment I think:

Judging by your ignorance you must be American!  If nascar was live on any of my TV channels I would know about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They just show highlights along side some other obscure sports in the middle of the night few days later.
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:38:50
Nope! It would if I had any LTC but I don't and I have never seen an ltc tip for this matter :)
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:34:30
A tip is a tip. It's ungrateful for anyone to think its too low.
There is an entire community here going nuts 24/7 tipping each other very little and having fun. Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:37:02
Where can I watch the Dogecar race tonight?? thanks
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:12:39
Did you just open a new account to make an  of yourself??
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:46:25
Always a pleasure to see an old genuine bitcoiner.

Yep, with your palm scan, pic and ID. They cant do anything without the DNA.
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:41:25
The answer is in your comment "0.3 cents" he tipped you BTC. You have already sold the bits he gave you to $$$. May be if you showed some appreciation and respect to BTC as a currency in its own right, you wont see it that way.
That's the difference between "some" bitcoiner here and the Dogecoin community. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:05:17
Thank you so much. You are a star. :))
@_date: 2014-03-23 09:38:07
I didn't join yet, I cant afford too. That makes you an early adopter. No I don't hate you :)
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:36:01
Changetip has a minimum withdrawal amount of 1 mBTC. I only found out when I tried to move them out.
I found this comment from the changetip MOD.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:43:28
I don't think they tip around here...
@_date: 2014-06-06 10:20:59
Yep, you got the trolls, haters and leechers back in your subs to leech on your coin.
Glad they left Dogecoin \o/
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:38:12
"us versus them"  absolutely NOT!!! There is no competition or war whatsoever!! to use your gloomy words.  just my own opinion and observation backed now by your defensive comment.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:47:57
The worst sort to have involved in a currency! parasitic speculators (the btc version of goldman sachs, jp morgan....).
Now I know the reason behind Bitcoin being used as a commodity to speculate and make money instead of a currency in its own right to buy goods and services.
And why tipping disappeared from this subs....
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:52:36
Feel free to donate some of your Doge as I am obviously unable to even get involved with Bitcoin du to its value.
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:52:35
Thank you very much. They don't deliver to the UK:(
BTC is rising lets wait and see.
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:30:08
That's what they tell everyone but that's not the case hence all the posts asking for a stream of the 1st dogecar race on the internet.
The entire Europe watched the race on the fans website.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:40:42


Your luck of knowledge is startling!! You don't need any money to start with Dogecoin or any other currency (except BTC) as you will get started up by generous tips..............
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:38:15
I do apologise that tip didn't go through (I think its the Ð in the command). lets try again  +dogecar verify
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:01:59
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:39:03
Dogecoin is, just about, still standing despite losing all the speculators who have now jumped back on the BTC band wagon to leech on the coin. They are back, God helps you true Bitcoiners \o/ 
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:17:53
Or just call it BTCtip! Never received or seen one so I am yet to get confused.
I am still having issue understanding mBTC stuff...But will eventually get it one day.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:57:49
Mad, certainly not! Did you read some of the comments left? The poster might well be some bearded fat bloke. But we don't know that for sure and people should show some self respect in this post or any other post for this matter. This is not 4chan is it!
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:48:20
Your point!   
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:01:45
27 days old account. The sort of morons that have given the bitcoin community a bad name. How long have you been involved in BTC?
Why don't you crawl back in your cage and finish your evolution process like everyone else.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:32:49
Someone left me this comment "you've already been filtered" what doest it mean! 
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:36:13
Surely a higher price commands a better quality coin :P
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:49:35


Does that help?
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:09:32
Poor American. You'll have more freedom moving to Russia or China :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:08:22
Why buy at $491? isn't it cheaper to get them at $460.
Or do you get better quality coins at a higher price!
PS: I don't know much about bitcoin.Just trying to learn it and get involved. Doge is all I know :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:40:06
I tip doge on a regular basis in Ðogecoin subredits and even facebook and twitter. I might need to wear a helmet when I tip your tip forward in this subreddit.  : )
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:07:20
I've come from DogeCoin, I was sent here to bring you back :)
Shame  Bitcoin is too expensive and hard to get involved in it.
This guy have been giving Bits since yesterday here:    joined by another Bitcoiner.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:21:56
How many bits in a 1uBit?

Not sure what you mean by "us" barely stating respectfully my OWN  opinion.
Which Bitconers have backed up and agreed with me in comments they have left to a similar comment i posted and even got my 1st BTC tip:  
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:21:38
Well, considering that you were the only one that didn't get the joke lol
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:53:29
I (honestly and genuinely ) don't have $10 to my name but I am trying to do something about    (similar one, in bitcoinbeg).

Nascar is not on TV network outside US borders unfortunately. Thanks for the tip.

Left it (the last comment) in the post you have mentioned.

How did you get to that conclusion?? 20 days old redditor!!
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:16:17
Fascinating the numbers of moronic comments left here by a bunch of primitive simpleton.
Someone asked for advice, help out if you don't have anything nice to say BE QUIET!! and go read something else. What is wrong with some of you!!!
This backs up my analysis and opinion about "some" guys here that tarnish the reputation of the real bitconiers.
 
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:35:50
Thank you very much. Very generous of you.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:15:50
Never been here before and...
Oh boy, why is this place so dark and gloomy!! Every comment here seem to be straight out of scrooge's mouth.
**Jeez, people lighten up a bit, you have a coin that is worth a lot you should be very proud of what you have achieved. You should be the generous sugar daddy's with your tipping and kindness and words of wisdom.**
**They say that money change people and it did, unfortunately, turn enthusiastic, clever egg heads pioneers into a wall street mentality guys.**
Within minutes of discovering this coins stuff (doge) I got tipped (didn't ask for it, just left a comment saying HI!) and got hooked ever since. 
I can safely say, I am glad that I didn't find Bitcoin subs first because I would probably been asked to GTFO. (tipping and kindness seem to be a sin around here).
**Anyway, people should be looking up to you guys as the guys that started it all and if it wasn't for these guys our coin wouldn't exist BUT you left the initiative and kindness and generosity  to a community that speaks broken English, have a dog as a mascot, dream of flying to the moon, call themselves shibes, they are not even sure how to pronounce "doge" and are busy building moon rockets!!! and guess what THEY TIP GENEROUSLY AND ARE LUNAR MILES AHEAD IN PR AND CHARITY FRONTS!!**
**Why cant a generous bitcoin guy (or guys)go to dogecoin or dogecoinbeg and tip the sh!!tt out of everyone (with kindness, not here is a tip you poor b.......) this is a free PR advice for the clever ones here (talk amongst yourselves and organise a raid and see the benefit and rewards from that).**
**I had a quick look in bitcoinbeg (WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU LOT WENT THERE?), EMBARASSING.**
Anyway, I am out of here. I don't have a BTC wallet and will probably never need one.
PS: next time I come around here (probably to read abusive replies :) ), please lighten up this place. Start by removing that gloomy grey banner on top and have something blue or green or something... decorate this place a bit...
No disrespect to anyone, just my opinion and wish you all the best. You people are great.  I am off.
 
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:26:19
You have no idea how happy I am that a real bitconer did leave a constructive comment. That backs up my personal though that  some guys do tarnish the good standing of the vast majority of the real and good bitconers. To put things into perspective this is my story.
Thanks for the tip my first BTC money. AND THANK YOU AGAIN!!
This is the link to my story:

PS: no idea what uBits means but will work it out eventually. I know what bits means as someone have been tipping since yesterday in his post.

DoubleCoin? I don't think I have ever had one? If I had its probably sitting on its own in a tipbot :)
Edit: I just remembered that I actually own number 1 double coin.

Damn, I missed the giveaway you mentioned. 
"it was in one of their giveaway threads, so it wasn't out of place. " Tipping is welcome and encouraged everywhere and in any post in you will not be out of place. Anyway, almost midnight, time for bed...
