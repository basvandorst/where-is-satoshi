@_date: 2016-04-08 16:29:16


I can only make the assumption that you do not live in a country with modern banks?
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:50:38
Or maybe you just haven't discovered it yet.
@_date: 2016-04-11 10:02:30
You must've replied to the wrong person. 
But anyway,


Same applies for bitcoin.


Same applies to bitcoin, however you don't get any of the insurance or other benefits.


I don't really see how this is relevant to anything, except that the credit card is completely useless unless you know the pin code, or have access to the 2FA device.
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:33:14
Because when using modern banks the payment experience surpasses bitcoin in pretty much every way. An app like Breadwallet really isn't anything special if you're used to decent banking.
@_date: 2016-04-26 06:15:22
Bitcoin should, and will be under the same regulation.
@_date: 2016-04-09 10:58:45
With Paypal you don't even need to bring up your phone. Alternatively you can use the credit card autofill option on your browser.
Essentially it's bitcoin without the need of scanning a QR code, plus you get the benefits of a bank.
@_date: 2015-12-13 03:11:00


Do you see any businesses openly selling illegal drugs? No? See, that's regulation in action.
The problem here is that there doesn't exist any legal alternatives for drugs.
However, there are tons of legal currencies and services that outperform bitcoin in every single way.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:29:22
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:59:27


There is this currency called "Euro". Have you heard of it? They have been very effective at applying a united monetary and economic policy simultaneously in multiple countries.


So you are seriously claiming the majority is ready to be thrown in jail/fined just to accept a different currency? Come the fuck on.
You still haven't been able to give a single proper counter argument to regulation that will eventually face bitcoin. Saying "people will not care about getting thrown in jail or being fined" is just not true.
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:37:54
"We will fine you or put you in jail if you accept or spend bitcoin" 
Boom, everyone stops using btc.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:52:40
But we have exactly the same predictions? Neither one of us is dumb enough to believe that bitcoin will gain any traction in Greece. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:53:26


Why exactly would governments welcome this change? Why would they want to give away monetary/economic control?
See you didn't really provide any argument against OP's points.


Is just a bunch of euphoric bullshit that doesn't help anyone.
Bitcoin can and will be easily regulated if/when it becomes big enough to threaten the stability of a countrys own currency.
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:08:09
How is this bitcoin related?
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:18:25
Exactly, I don't see any businesses selling illegal drugs.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:41:01


They wouldn't need to. If bitcoin was a big enough threat for the USA to ban it, then other countries would most likely follow. Especially if the US would pressure them to do so.


Comparing Torrents to bitcoin is a bit dishonest, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:08:53
Just like banks are only needed for exhanging EUR to USD? Do you even know what the functions of a bank are?

Yes, I would also like to sell my personal information for $10.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:33:15
What the fuck? You think it's a good thing countries lie about their economic situation and take loans they can't afford?
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:45:03


Yeah, I think we're done here.
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:15:46
You really think that isn't accounted for in the current price? It's not like the halving is coming to anyone as a surprise, so the price will already be adjusted long before.
EDIT: For fucks sake guys, instead of downvoting me you should probably read up on how the pricing of financial instruments work.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:27:27
I'm afraid so. I haven't seen any convincing points against this yet.
Let's hope someone could jump in on this discussion and provide some counter arguments.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:41:02
So you are now arguing against yourself? What is going on?
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:57:06
Yes, take advantage of those in potential trouble. The bitcoin way. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:17:05
I will never understand why someone would visit a bar/restaurant just because they accept a specific currency.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:58:07
You clearly haven't followed the situation at all. If anything, this makes the euro stronger. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:03:36
It's like comparing the USD to Apple Pay, they shouldn't be compared as they are fundamentally two completely different products.
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:27:48


Since when has been a pro-bitcoin subreddit? It's good that there are differing opinions, otherwise this echo chamber would become even more dangerous for those involved.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:51:17

This right here is why people laugh at bitcoiners.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:04:52
So not really relevant to bitcoin, got it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:14:58
I'm as relevant to bitcoin, as bitcoin is to Greece.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:21:19
The comments in this thread remind me of why it's an absolute waste of time to try and have a proper discussion about anything on @_date: 2015-06-27 16:02:33
$50 is a laughably small amount. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:21:57
The sad truth is that bitcoin will not be able to overcome this hurdle.
Think about the situation from a business owners perspective; Why would you ever risk your career/business just for the sake of accepting another currency?
Sure, the very niche black markets will remain, but they would exist without bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:35:10


Keyword: Illegal
You honestly believe people will willingly risk their whole life/business just to accept btc?
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:37:07
Apparently I'm paying as much attention to bitcoin as the greeks are, as I don't really see the relevance.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:05:15
Can we please, please stop with this Greece bullshit. Greece doesn't care about bitcoin, at all. Nor should they.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:26:15


Source needed.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:34:36
And bitcoin isn't. ":D"
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:22:09


That's a really brave prediction.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:00:28
The problem here is that bitcoin is a worse alternative than the euro for the greek. If anything, bitcoin can make the situation even worse. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 14:58:57
Or you use a CC and chargeback if needed.
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:52:45
I think you meant "If I were completely ignorant about how any of this works, I would be trying to buy BTC now".
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:05:41
I'm not sure if you see the incredible bias in your comment. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:09:11
Do you have a source for your claim?
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:07:18
I honestly can't believe that this thread is upvoted.
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:56:13
People would still use "Bitcoin banks" if bitcoin for some reason was to get popular. 
Bitcoin wouldn't have prevented anything at all. 
Storing your assets in bitcoin is comparable to storing your cash in a personal safe. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:14:34
Sounds like you didn't experience the 1990's. Because what you said couldn't be further from the truth.

Imagine if you would just use the services of a bank. It would feel exactly the same to the kids, although the parents would be able to cancel the transactions if needed.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:55:32


You haven't followed the developments in the EU, have you?


It can't be shut down, but it can be regulated to obscurity. No one will use a currency that might get you thrown in jail.


Come on man, you seriously can't compare the music industry to a global currency. It's a completely different thing. Companies are not ready to risk their entire business for the sake of accepting a currency. Or do you see many companies selling pirated music?
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:47:06
How exactly could bitcoin prevent the crisis in Greece?
People will use banks, doesn't matter if the currency is bitcoin or fiat. 
If people use banks, this will happen. If countries are unable to manage their economy and pay their debts, this will happen. 
What currency you use is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:10:19
The average Joe doesn't send their kids allowance money over a distance. They actually meet their children F2F.

You might want to read up on that, then.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:09:35
Now why exactly would anyone use one of these machines if they already have Euros in cash?
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:44:00


That is exactly my point. Which is why I asked for a source to the study he is referring to, to make sure he is not talking complete bullshit.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:28:41


The government would obviously not target individuals, but businesses instead. Companies can't really hide the fact that they accept bitcoin. Plus how else are you going to buy bitcoin if not with a bank account that's registered in your name? Bitcoin ATM's are also out of the question, as they require identification.


It can't be shut down, but it sure as hell can be regulated to a completely worthless state.
@_date: 2015-06-27 07:20:40
That's unfortunately not how it works.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:25:23


Do you understand the concept of fractional banking?


Yeah, because no one has ever frozen someones bitcoins. Oh wait.
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:07:29
Explain please. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 14:54:38
How can they trust something they've never even heard of?
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:27:40
I honestly can't tell if you're being serious.
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:35:40
It's amazing that people keep upvoting these shitty posts. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:23:35
Banks make their profits by loaning the money others have deposited. 
If you were to have no fractional banking, then banks couldn't make any money either. And they have to finance their operations in some way, hence the fees will be much higher to compensate. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:03:55
Fractional banking will exist even if the banks operated purely on bitcoin.  
If anything, the fees of a bitcoin bank will be higher if they were to have "proof of reserves". 
Come on man, you should read up on the basics of economics before you start arguing about stuff. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:07:04
The thing is that what you're talking about is already easily doable with fiat, free and instantly.
Bitcoin doesn't really bring anything new to the table in this situation.
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:47:41
All these kinds of posts come off as very very desperate. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:37:22
Most bitcoiners are just part of another clueless herd. As most don't have the slightest clue about economics, and just want to get rich quick. 
No smart person would be celebrating the Greece situation, yet everyone on is really enjoying it. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:13:04
Nothing would be better than irreversible transactions in a system designed for kids.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:00:43
Isn't it pretty counter intuitive to hedge against a currency with another currency that is also dropping in value?
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:35:48


You do realize this has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying currency? This would have happened if the EU used Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:45:28
Giving up monetary and economic policies can hardly be considered as advantages.
The fact is that bitcoin is very easily regulated by governments, and that can't really be bypassed.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:25:20


Of course everyone wouldn't stop using it. But people who have something to lose would definitely go back to traditional currencies.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:32:38
Well I mean, you're saying that as if it's a fact when in reality you have no fucking idea.
@_date: 2015-06-27 09:26:36

@_date: 2015-06-19 20:31:39
Yes, which is exactly why Paypal, Visa and Mastercard are all so unpopular and barely used by anyone.

I honestly can't tell if you are being serious.
@_date: 2015-06-30 04:53:40
Nothing smart in the FAQ. Do you have any reasons you could mention?
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:47:11
That quote alone reveals that the author has absolutely no idea what he is talking about.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:16:55


Exactly, so why do you make it seem like bitcoin would be a good hedge, when there are absolutely no statistics to prove it?
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:01:33
Like 30cents?
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:21:33


If you are innocent the EU does protect you from getting your money frozen. Of course if you're a criminal you wouldn't want to live in the EU, but as far as normal civilians go their assets are perfectly safe.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:06:02
Believe it or not, banks already offer everything you mentioned.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:10:26
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:25:55
1 euro? You really think that's enough to attract anyone?
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:05:47
This is not related to bitcoin in any way.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:10:00


See that's actually a pretty awful reason, how can you expect bitcoin to grow if everyone just uses it because of ideological reasons like you?
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:34:56
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:59:53
Isn't the comment section of exactly that?
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:26:00
How is this relevant to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:49:12
You can't be serious. I refuse to believe anyone could be this clueless.
@_date: 2014-10-25 19:42:57
Should we start posting about collectibles and real estate, too? After all, they're a store of value just like cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:34:52
I'm talking about proper companies, where the sellers don't risk their lives/businesses selling their product.
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:11:15


There are actually quite a lot of those videos out there, about Mastercard and Visa. There was even this shitty MSPaint anti-mastercard image spreading around this week on It's pretty safe to say that there's more anti-CC content made by Bitcoiners than there is anti-bitcoin content made by CC companies.
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:44:34
You really think anyone cares about downvotes?
@_date: 2014-04-27 14:38:20


Because you just said:


It's a waste of resources if you implement a payment method you know very few will use. 
Also, I do not view accepting bitcoin as a waste. It can obviously benefit larger companies with huge customerbases, but your company is very unlikely to ever gain anything from accepting btc.
@_date: 2014-10-31 19:12:30
So essentially you want bitcoin to be like fiat?
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:41:24
Yes, just like Paypal died when BTC was introduced as a internet payment option.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:46:01
You are exactly right.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:49:19
What am I supposed to do then? If promoting shit content isn't enough to convince you that this is a bad idea, I don't know what will. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 11:13:12


Except pretty much every retail store in the Europe already has the capability to accept ApplePay already. It's all a matter of updating the software, which according to people working in the industry is close to being done.

Can you please answer my question though. Are you being serious?
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:52:35
But I always thought bitcoin couldn't be stopped by laws and regulations?
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:45:03
Oh my fucking god. Please, stop shitposting.
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:20:45
I'm sure there is, but I can't be bothered to find it.
 Since you are ready to break the TOS of iTunes, I'm certain you wouldn't mind to bypass some other country restrictions too and get you 1% discount.
Or you could just use a Germany specific cashback service, I can't name any but I'm 100% sure they exist.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:36:20
This is the wrong place for logic. Please leave.

Well that's not tacky at all. That might actually be even worse than [this.](
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:08:36
The price is dropping because no one is buying bitcoin, everyone is just selling.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:57:52
It takes 3-5 business days to transfer money from one account to another, this process has to be done twice when sending bitcoin.
First you send dollars from your bank account to the bitcoin exchange, then you buy bitcoin, then you send the bitcoin to another account. This process will take at least 6 days. I am not making shit up.
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:16:42
No, that's cringeworthy as fuck.
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:42:53


Keep in mind that if the "fiat industry" feels threatened by bitcoin they can also start improving their services and might make cryptocurrencies useless.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:51:12
So we can lose all our net worth in a week without even having the police involved? Excellent!
@_date: 2014-10-15 05:16:20


This wasn't Paypals fault, though. $7 dollars more is also quite the price increase.
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:54:20
What's the point in having the value pre-loaded to the cards? Why not just add the credit after the purchase?

This has to be a joke.

Maybe ask them to integrate ChangeTip to their site? I'm sure they would want lots of 2 cent donations from the generous community.
@_date: 2014-07-07 10:16:08
So why would anyone start to use bitcoin if they would have to pay fees for it? Might as well stick with their current currency and not need to worry about volatility.

"Bitcoin bits" might be the dumbest name for currency I've ever heard.

tl;dr Don't be a fucking retard.
@_date: 2014-07-12 14:13:29
Well what did you expect? The banking system is pretty freaking large compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-07 03:11:51
Bitcoin isn't and never will be good with microtransactions, calling it easy to use is also a straight up lie. 
You are also making some pretty odd assumptions of gamers. The majority of gamers aren't really interested in technology nor do they have any magical skills that make them automatically good with bitcoin. You'd be surprised how technologically illiterate gamers are. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:45:57
That's unfortunately not how the market works.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:32:07
Why are you giving away money like that?
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:30:32
But you can't regulate a decentralized video service. So your idea is pretty flawed if aiming for the mass market.


I don't see how that's relevant.
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:18:27
As I said, that sure sounds sustainable.
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:22:56
That's perfectly understandable.
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:45:56
Any disadvantages are usually completely neglected and countered by "But fiat is still worse" or just standard ad hominem.
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:52:15
Because it's difficult to acquire, store and spend.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:06:16
Let's completely skip the process of acquiring bitcoin. That sure makes sense!
@_date: 2014-12-02 09:05:03

Wow, so convenient. Why would anyone bother with buying bitcoin when they might as well use fiat and speed up the process.

That really isn't saying much. The top lists are country specific and documentaries are not a popular/competitive category on iTunes.
The documentary isn't even on the [top 100]( list. Even movies like finding nemo(2003) and bridesmaids are more popular. According to [this]( the documentary is actually 9th on the list.
If you still believe the documentary had any effect on the markets confidence you must be very delusional.

I don't see why that makes it specifically good for gamers. It's not like every games is passionate about cryptocurrency and care enough to invest in bitcoin. Paypal, or some other easy payment method is ideal for gamers, not bitcoin.

This is a forum. The point of a forum is to have a discussion. That's why caring about what someone else has to say is kind of the cornerstone of this whole place.

Based on my observations from watching I think it's safe to say that the majority of bitcoiners don't have any friends to buy christmas gifts for.

Of course I'm part of this community. I own bitcoin and I am regularly taking part in the discussions on this subreddit. Just because I don't like partaking in the circlejerks doesn't mean I'm a troll. I should be able to criticize bitcoin using valid arguments without being called a "retarded troll".
I don't see why you decided to go all ad hominem on me, it just makes you look even more lunatic.
Going through my post history and calling me a "retarded troll" on every single comment isn't exactly a sign of a mentally stable person either.

@_date: 2014-05-13 16:54:14
It takes 3-5 days to send money to a bank account, and you have to do that twice when sending money by bitcoin.
  The volatility of bitcoin will also cause bitcoin to gain/lose more value in 6-10 days than it would cost to straight up use a bank.
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:19:11

Not a single one of the "main arguments" will be interesting to the consumer contemplating between the "iWallet" and bitcoin.

It's so damn obvious that you have never used a bank that can be considered "good" on modern standards. 
You get instant free national money transfers, a secure and insured place to store your money and investments, a free Visa/Mastercard, free virtual credit cards to protect against identity theft, 24/7 customer support, great mobile applications, free ATMs, cheap loans, free professional investment advice, great bank-exclusive offers with cashbacks etc. And yes, this really all comes for free with no monthly fees.
And most importantly, you can spend your money at every single business in the world.
You say that bitcoin is "actually a less of a hassle than dealing with banks" but you totally forget that the majority will never even have to deal with their banks as everything just works effortlessly.
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:16:59

The thing is that it doesn't happen in modern countries. I didn't include the US in my statement as it can't really be considered modern in terms of banking and legislation.
In most of Europe/EU you can transfer money instantly without fees, which is essentially the selling point of bitcoin.

Do you not realize that this method is currently way better than anything bitcoin has to offer? There is absolutely no way you can transfer 2999 dollars for cheaper/faster than $5/3days with bitcoin.

What the fuck are you talking about? It will take longer, and be more expensive to convert USD to bitcoin, and bitcoin to EUR rather than straight up sending the money through a bank.
@_date: 2014-07-24 12:24:47
That's just straight up false.  You get very good exchange rates from pretty much every bank. In my experience the conversion rate charge has been about 0.5%-1%.
@_date: 2014-07-03 00:11:17

@_date: 2014-12-01 14:52:16
That 2-3% is only relevant when discussing CC fees. No one is paying 3% for per debit card transaction. In europe the fees are usually free or about 1-5 cents.
Please remember that we are talking from the merchants point of view.
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:55:56


Do they though? In modern countries bitcoin really doesn't provide any benefits compared to fiat. So I don't see why banks would feel threatened, when they already offer a superior service.

Nope. It's never a constant rate. Visa/Mastercard adds a fee on every transaction based on the currencies used, this can be everywhere from 0 to 1,95%.

I'm not discounting it at all. I'm just pointing out that paying with BTC online really isn't that special and effortless as everyone claims. It's just another variation of what Paypal/Google/Amazon etc. already provide.
Fiat online payment services have had years to optimize their services, so they are already at a very, very consumer friendly stage. No matter what bitcoin does, it probably won't improve the online payment technology drastically from a consumer POV.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:28:14
I think you're exactly right in your assessment.
Small companies like "local PC repair shops" will not really benefit from accepting bitcoin outside of the temporary publicity boost you get from making a post on this subreddit.

Yes, so easy to spend your bitcoin in one of the 3 stores that accepts bitcoin.


But not easier than ApplePay or quick NFC payments. Bitcoin doesn't even come close in terms of convenience compared to modern NFC solutions.

That's already possible with normal phones, you don't need a $35 smartphone for that.
 Keep in mind that these people would need to somehow buy their bitcoins as well, without a proper efficient banking system they are almost guaranteed to pay huge processing fees on both Local currency-&gt;BTC and BTC-&gt;local currency exchanges.
I mean do you honestly believe that people who can't even access clean water want to get involved in the huge hassle of acquiring and storing bitcoin? 


So you expect these 6 billion people who don't even have access to banking, to suddenly have constant access to cheap internet and education resources regarding how to use/store your bitcoin safely?

If you buy using PayPal with your CC/debit card linked you will get the 2% bonus. Kraken taking 0.35% trading fee only leaves 1.65% left for bitcoin, which is all covered by cashback programs.


That just proves my point further. When you bought bitcoin shouldn't affect whether or not you get a product cheaper with BTC or with PayPal.

I don't see why this is huge. You don't get any benefits from buying with BTC instead of fiat. The retailers will never see any actual bitcoins, as the transaction is instantly converted into local currency.
Also keep in mind that this is not in anyway beneficial for the retailer either, as he has to pay a transaction fee for each bitcoin purchase too.

Comparing firefox to bitcoin just shows how fucking clueless you are. I guess you could compare it to the blockchain, but comparing a free internet browser to currency is pretty fucking far fetched.
How would it be impossible to enfore? Threat merchants who accept bitcoin with jailtime, and boom, all the merchants suddenly stop accepting btc. Guess what happens when no one accepts bitcoin? Yeah, you guessed it, the price crashes effectively making bitcoin useless as a currency. The black market can only support so much liquidity and the price would stabilize at a much, much lower rate than what it could otherwise be.

And pay a 3% fee. Suddenly "potential savings on transaction fees and charges" are out of the picture, basically eliminating the financial benefit of using btc.


It's true though. On a worldwide scale you can really say that on one accepts it.  Try living on bitcoin in Africa/Asia or Europe for a month. You'll see how unpopular bitcoin really is outside of this echochamber.


I have never denied that, and I completely understand. But for the moment it seems that using bitcoin really has no real advantages.

That is a really shitty comparison, and is not true in the slightest.
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:23:53


Really? is always circlejerking around how great bitcoin is for merchants, how terrible bitcoin can be for the Average Joe is barely ever mentioned.
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:59:02
Why is anyone upvoting this shitty "article"?
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:38:33
It's most likely not worth the hassle. Unless you have a huge customer base you will most likely never even make a single transaction with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:09:19
No. It will just make the bitcoin community look more desperate than it already is.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:59:36


If that is true then I feel sorry for you.
Thanks for the discussion, but I honestly can't be bothered to keep talking with someone whose vocabulary only consists of "retard", "idiot" and "troll".

What the fuck is that supposed to be? A shitty article or a shitty advertisement?
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:16:05


No, I just realized that no matter what I, or anyone else says you won't listen. So I can't even be bothered.
You keep on talking about merchants all the time. Apples Wallet will be a consumer oriented service, not a B2B service.


It's a double edged sword.  No chargebacks is good for the merchant, but awful for the consumer.


Nope, don't care about that. We are talking about consumers, not merchants.


It's pretty naive to think that all those 4 billion people now suddenly have access to that with bitcoin. They can't afford a device to use bitcoin, let alone spend the time to learn how to use it. Not even mentioning the volatility that can be fatal to the poor.
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:43:57


No. Saving is the opposite of using. Holy fuck please stop trolling.  It seems that you are actually desperate enough to argue about semantics. But unfortunately using something as a store of value is the exact same thing as saving, so your logic doesn't really work here.
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:14:19
That's pretty hilarious.
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:41:07
It isn't worth the effort for small businesses to accept bitcoin. The time and money costs of implementing bitcoin payments are too high for it to be a smart investment.

A big problem I see is that people tend to exaggerate bitcoins everyday benefits, making bitcoiners look like a bunch of delusional fanatics. Yes, bitcoin has its strong points but it's not the answer to everything.
We should also stop tipping new users with $0.02 worth of bitcoin, it just makes the community look bad.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:19:10

Shh, don't interrupt the circlejerk.
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:47:12
Then you are completely ignoring the process of buying the bitcoin and converting it back to fiat after it's been sent. Also, during this the value of bitcoin will most definitely fluctuate more than 5€.
Buying bitcoin might take several days, and the fees of buying btc will most likely be higher than 5€.
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:03:57
But saving is not using, in fact it's the exact opposite.

You are not actually getting it 1-3% cheaper. You are just gathering points.
Many companies offer cashback bonuses, I don't know CC issuers in Germany, but in the country I live it's pretty common to get 1-2% on everything you buy with your  Visa/debit card. And if these cashback offers aren't available in Germany, then I'm sure you can find online retailers who have a similar bonus programs like Gyft(i.e. gather points for later purchases.)
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:14:24


No need to be a fucking asshole just because you can't admit there's a flaw in bitcoin.

Remember the difference between innovations and inventions. At the moment you are arguing about Apple inventing stuff, which they didn't really do. But they sure as hell innovated a lot of things.
Apple used existing ideas to create new markets, the mp3 market, the mobile phone market and the PC market were all revolutionized due to Apples innovations.

The large discounts you're talking about are all part of marketing campaigns, and are only temporary. The moment chargebacks enter the bitcoin space is the moment the 0%-3% discounts also disappear.


"all you need". You really think the poorest of poor people will spend all their money on a phone only to store a very volatile currency, when they instead could just store their money in dollars? 
Even you have to admit that bitcoin security in developing countries will be laughably bad.

Fuck. Poe's Law makes browsing so fucking difficult.


True, but Bitcoin is not a really a currency in the traditional sense. As there is no central organization forcing people to use btc, means that the most important thing affecting bitcoins value is its popularity amongst the majority. So if no one cares the value won't go up either.

So, People who already own a shitton of  btc, people with a bad credit record and people who have already used Gyft before. That's a pretty tiny niche. 
Getting 3% cashback is pretty easy if you want to go through the trouble of finding a deal that gives you that. Which in any case, is still easier than the process of converting fiat to bitcoin to gyft, and then buying more bitcoin with fiat. 
I get that the things you listed might be nice, but for the overwhelming majority those "advantages" don't overweigh the ease of use of using cash.

10 bits...
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:43:41
I am also assuming that you do not purchase your bitcoins from a BTC ATM or with cash via Localbitcoins. 
I think I'm missing the point you're trying to make? Of course I need an account to make these transactions effortlessly. This applies to both bitcoin and fiat services.
@_date: 2014-10-18 08:18:48
Those are all pretty bad reasons, though. If you don't have cash or a card then how are you supposed to acquire bitcoin?
To support Gyft and tell Coinbase to fuck off are valid reasons. But if those are the only good reasons then wouldn't it be time to reconsider why you're using bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:48:42
Oh I agree, everyone here wants to have a discussion. But the quality of the discussion is beyond shit, and incredibly biased with a very narrow view of the world.

Sure, NFC has been available for use in many retail stores outside of US already. But the technology was never really adopted by the customers.
Now with ApplePay it will most definitely get a massive boost in usage, as it was the main selling point of the iPhone 6. I mean when before have you seen the media talk about NFC as extensively as after the iPhone announcement?
It's the Apple effect all over again.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:01:33
Look at the ApplePay demos. It's way faster than a standard CC/cash transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:36:33


See that's where things get subjective. You are ready to break the TOS of iTunes but not faking your address on Google. 
If someone is ready to fake credit card information, then Google Wallet is the cheapest way to go. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:50:42
Brilliant to current bitcoin users, but it sucks for "normal" users and future bitcoin users.  Neither one of the last-mentioned groups will be able to take advantage of the 30% discount, as the offer will surely be available only for a very limited time.


You realize Newegg isn't doing this only to get customers spend their "odd bitcoin balances at regular price too"? When the 30% discounts disappear, so does the bitcoin customerbase.
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:10:43
Yeah, no. A SEPA transfer takes 3 days, and during that time the price of bitcoin will most likely change by more than 5 euros. And after that the receiver still needs to convert the btc into dollars during which the value will fluctuate even more.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:28:53

You are "giving" money to someone who you know won't accept it, with the sole intent to promote bitcoin. From an outsiders POV it really does look pathetic.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:45:59
May I ask, why? Everything you mentioned is done more conventiently with traditional payment methods.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:26:01


Compared to bitcoin it's accepted pretty much everywhere, when ApplePay lands in Europe it will gain massive popularity as pretty much every retail store already has NFC implemented just waiting to be used with Applepay.


ApplePay is not designed to do that, it's just an electronic credit card. But sending money with Applepay will most likely be implemented some time in the future, as there are already multiple apps that allow sending money free of charge to anyone with the same app.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:51:06
is such an excellent example of this.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:21:09
No. Just no.

Please explain. All those organizations are needed for bitcoin too if it ever grows big. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:42:20


Even you must realize how fucking stupid of an argument that is.


It might outperform it "behind the scenes", but the consumer will never notice any big differences. If you really think fiat payment services wouldn't adapt to advances that bitcoin makes, you're just being stupid.
Now please, if you don't have anything smart to say; Just shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:40:17
TL;DR You only want to get rich, and not actually use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:32:02
To put things in perspective. 5.3B is not even 1% of Apples market cap.
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:10:28
Well you are spending the same bitcoin twice. So it is exactly like copying.

Is that card designed by a 5 year old? The average person would never bother to learn how to use bitcoin only to get the $5, especially when it is presented in a way that looks very sketchy.

I have never seen anyone laugh at the technology. Most people just laugh at the financial and social aspects of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:43:47


The exhange fee is usually about 1-2%. My bank for example uses a rate of max. 1.95%. So with a 3% cashback bonus(which is fairly normal) you would actually get your giftcards cheaper than with bitcoin. 
This even excludes the value fluctuation and transaction fees of when acquiring bitcoin. Which sure as hell are over 1-2%.


Are you 100% sure about that? Usually it is enough just to use any CC and input a US address. That's at least how other digital distributors like Amazon deal with it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:03:54
Do you even realize how difficult and complex it would be for Steam to implement bitcoin as a payment method? On top of that it would take years to make back the money invested into the implementation.
It just isn't feasible for Valve to accept bitcoin yet, as the userbase is way too small and the demand is pretty much non-existent.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:36:23

Someone getting into 5 year old technology can hardly be considered an "early adopter".
@_date: 2014-07-25 12:31:21
So basically only if you want to promote/support bitcoin/gyft is when this payment method is sensible. 
The 3% cashback is available on pretty much every CC, so it isn't really an advantage. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:16:17
I am trying to make mislead bitcoiners realize that bitcoin is not the perfect currency yet. 
Don't get me wrong, I like bitcoin but fucking hate the delusional community that's built around it.

It's exactly what I want to discuss that is important here. If you would take a fucking moment to look at the context of the quote this discussion started from, then you would understand that everything I have been saying the whole fucking time is correct.


No, because it was assumed that the person already had 700 euros. And the point was to check if it is faster and/or cheaper to send the 700 euros to India by using a bank or bitcoin.


I don't give a fuck about "your comparison" because it is not relevant in the slighest to the discussion.
@_date: 2014-09-13 21:26:42
Yes, but they do not have 0% processing fees because they still do the majority of their business via credit card companies.

They don't use paypal. Instead they use Klarna, which is a service similar to paypal with way better statistics, support and only a transaction fee of 2%. So they probably don't even want to convert current Klarna customers into using bitcoin.

Yes, it is in fact a flaw of bitcoin that no one is using it. The phone network would also be fucking useless if no one would use it. That's kind of how networks work.
Also, you should not mix bitcoin as a technology, and bitcoin as a currency. They are two entirely different things.
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:39:01
Their opinion is perfectly understandable. Only a few people would ever use bitcoin as a payment method, so why waste time on implementing it? I'm sure they don't have too many people working for their "company" anyway.
Also, the way you act and "represent" bitcoin in that thread doesn't exactly help your cause either.

Venmo isn't really meant for b2c, so that 3% isn't relevant in this case. OP talked about sending money person to person, in which case Venmo, Snapcash etc. is greatly superior to bitcoin.

Why would you use bitcoin when you can use fiat? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:53:54

If you really believe many people would use bitcoin as a donation tool for molten you are pretty fucking delusional.

Yeah, people in developing countries really want to spend their whole monthly salary to buy a phone just to get a service that banks already offer for much cheaper.

You can't. So they can't sue you from doing a chargeback either.

There is absolutely no way of knowing if you're in the first 10% or the last 10%. It's all speculation. If anything, it seems like we're in the middle of the bell curve.

I'd much rather use free instant bank transfers. It's easier and it's the same currency I borrowed.
@_date: 2014-06-21 13:00:06


Yeah I might have misworded that. I meant that it is difficult to buy things with bitcoin, the spending part is obviously a bit too easy.
@_date: 2014-09-04 21:55:13
Google Wallet is also just one click, Amazon and Paypal are two. 
"Much easier and less clicks" is overexaggerating it a bit. Also keep in mind that if you don't have a Coinbase account things get much more complicated.
E: Why are you guys downvoting me when I just pointed out that Google Wallet requires equally as many actions as a bitcoin transaction? I knew is insecure, but not this insecure.
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:53:57
Oh god that's so bad.

As I said, a very small amount of people will ever send money out of country borders.


It's only valuable if you need a service like that, which the majority do not.


That doesn't even come to outweighing all the perks of using fiat.

Shouldn't it be pretty fucking obvious that they don't accept bitcoin if you check out their payment methods from the website? 
This post is the epitome of shitposting.

Seriously. 10 bits?

No, they aren't. I for example like the technology itself but fucking hate the god awful community. And I feel like most of buttcoiners are the same way.

The bitcoin 3% offer might also be only a limited time offer. There is no way to know.


Why should I as a consumer care about that stuff? As long as I get my product cheaper I'm happy.


How come? I would never bother going through all this stuff when I can just use PayPal/Visa.

I know you're joking. But there are actually people doing this for real.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:26:07
So bascially the main reason is because you like the ideology behind it? If so, I totally understand that.
 But I hate when people try to disguise their blind fanaticism with poor arguments such as "If I run out of money in a bar I can call friends in other countries and they send me more within minutes.". Because really, everything you mentioned again has been possible with fiat for over a decade already.
I guess bitcoin might be a nice thing to use in countries where the banking system is lagging behind, but in most of Europe for example using bitcoin only makes things more complicated and difficult.

@_date: 2014-08-11 10:57:03
My comment was intended to be sarcastic, yes.
I'm sorry but I can't help you with how your local jurisdiction treats BTC.
The second question is easier to answer, though. It is very difficult for consumers to acquire bitcoin if your country has a low e-payment adoption rate. At the current stage it wouldn't be a viable option for you to only accept bitcoin.  There are very few bitcoin only businesses that manage to survive, so starting a BTC only company in a country with very marginal adoption doesn't exactly seem like the best decision.
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:48:23

That's a pretty accurate statement of the majority of bitcoiners. He's doing the exact same thing is.
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:23:15
Yes I totally agree that bitcoin is the way to go for criminals. But for the average EU citizen bitcoin doesn't give you any advantages at all.
To see bitcoin get mainstream we need to capture the interest of the masses, which won't happen by promoting features that are only beneficial to criminals.

I'm luckily not from the US. But you have to admit that the benefits of using bitcoin instead of paypal/credit card are really non-existent, even for EU residents.
The amount of people from Europe using the US iTunes store is really small. For Gyfts target audience(US citizens) using Google Wallet is by far the best way to go when buying giftcards.

No shit? What's your point?
@_date: 2014-12-01 11:52:24
Not to mention it's completely free in most of europe. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 03:32:30
So basically there's really no big advantage to using bitcoin as a consumer. 


That's already easily doable with fiat instantly with no cost. It's not a pain at all, it's actually even easier than with bitcoin.


That also means you can't create subscriptions which is pretty damn inconvenient. What if I want my bills to be automatically paid? Yeah, I have to rely on a third party just like with fiat, suddenly it's not so revolutionary anymore.


That has no relevance to the consumer. You'll just get refunded any money that is lost, unlike with bitcoin where there is no chance to get your money back.
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:20:10
Exactly. Just like "shill" and "buttcoiner".

@_date: 2014-09-25 21:05:39
Double spending is essentially the same as copying bitcoin.
There is also no proof about copying being "literally impossible". Bitcoin is not a 100% safe system, and there is bound to be some flaws in it that enable copying. It just hasn't been discovered yet.
@_date: 2014-09-24 11:16:19

Experts have absolutely no idea about the future price.

That's not how electric bills work. And do you really expect users to use a website that makes your computer run slow and use up battery life instantly?


No, because no one will ever use your website.
Also, the "About Us" section on your website is quite a hilarious read. Can't really tell if you're being serious with it.

Except they are corporations, bitcoin isn't. The banks are advertising their services, not dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:00:26
Still technically true in some countries. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:35:38
No. That's not what being delusional means. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are plenty of smart people attending, but based on my experiences with the bitcoin community it seems that the most delusional bitcoin fanatics tend to attend conventions more often than the rational users. Hence there will be a larger delusional/normal ratio at the convention than what you are normally used to seeing. 
You can think bitcoin will succeed without being delusional about it. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:46:23
Yeah, because acquiring bitcoin, having no chargebacks, having to be afraid of bitcoins value to crash, not being accepted by any merchants is also easy. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:39:48
I'm guessing you don't realize how small of an amount 10 bits is.

So there's no way I can remove the link between changetip and my account? That's pretty annoying.
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:25:44


Isn't that also exactly how the current bitcoin userbase is like?


Hasn't Apple stressed multiple times how they don't care about marketshare at all? I mean isn't it pretty obvious marketshare isn't their priority based on how they price their products.

No, that's not what we discussed at all. The discussion was about whether it is faster to send 700€ to India using a bank or by using bitcoin. 
In this case it is not "intellectually dishonest" to include the process of acquiring bitcoin into the comparison, because it is assumed that the starting currency is Euro.

Let's be real. The reason people on are so passionate is because there's a minimal chance they'll get rich off bitcoin.
If the price stagnates at 300-400 I promise the passionate fans will start disappearing and the people who actually have a use for btc will stay.

This comment made your thought process much clearer, and I more or less agree with everything you said. 
I agree that saying it will never be an option for the average Joe is overexaggerating, there's definitely a possibility of bitcoin gaining huge market adoption rates.
Thank you for having this level-headed discussion. It's very rare to meet people on who can see both the positives and negatives of bitcoin in its current state.

Well it's free in the EU.
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:06:31
I hope they will add an option to show the price in dollars. Otherwise it could be pretty inconvenient.
@_date: 2014-11-07 15:51:04
I suggest you go outside and get some situation awareness that you seem to be heavily lacking.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:01:28
Why would they use Tor if the internet can't be regulated in the first place?
@_date: 2014-07-16 02:54:31
You can't compare a currency with any of those.  You can't directly regulate bitcoin efficiently, true. But by regulating where/how it can be accepted can indirectly have a huge effect on bitcoin.
Make it illegal to accept or own bitcoin -&gt; suddenly a huge part of bitcoin users will stop using btc, and the demand will diminish. Effectively destroying the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:39:06
That's completely true, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. So it doesn't really make any sense to make such speculations.
@_date: 2014-10-08 04:11:07
No, no you didn't. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:30:30
I feel like is really blowing this chargeback problem way out of proportion.
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:53:00
If making one phonecall or sending one email is a huge hassle then you must live quite the effortless life. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:30:17
Yes, let's make bitcoin look even more like MLM, that will surely raise the price.
@_date: 2014-10-06 10:18:51
It's unfortunate that we don't know if banks are even involved yet.
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:48:28
In the grand scheme of things, yes.
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:21:36
It seems like that is actually the only reason for doing this.
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:36:16
Because this surely wouldn't attract scammers! 
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:32:04
This has to be a joke, right?
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:02:23
You're saying that people, who are incapable of setting up a google wallet account, would suddenly be knowledgeable enough to purchase and use bitcoin? Wake the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:47:24
Calling it a "little obvious" is being kind. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:10:53
"Skype replacement"
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:21:02
Finally they have added the option to easily delete an account. Now I won't get drowned in generous $0.02 tips ever again.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:58:37
Just curious, are you being serious or are you playing a "bitcoin evangelist" character? Because if you are being serious you have bigger concerns than the Western Union fees.
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:56:38
1 million people spamming me with 3 cent tips because my dad died? Yeah, it would make it feel even worse and probably angry too.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:22:12
Since when has become a place for selling used shit?
@_date: 2014-11-24 11:48:22
So basically a PayPal donate button?
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:14:36
Isn't that exactly what bitcoin fanatics do as well?
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:36:33
Yes, I get it. But why would anyone bother? The majority just wants to pay a constant monthly fee and don't have to care about when and how much of bandwidth they use.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:22:39
Use common sense.
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:53:48
in a nutshell.
@_date: 2014-07-24 12:17:55
Or you know, use a credit card and all the things you mentioned becomes a reality.
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:33:47
Comparing internet with bitcoin is pretty stupid, though.

Dollar-&gt;Bitcoin-&gt;Gift card
So convenient.
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:53:31
It's also pretty important to note that in modern countries that percentage is way lower. So the problem has essentially already been solved without even having to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:42:22
You are right. But in this case there is absolutely no reason to use bitcoin instead of the aforementioned services.
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:36:33
As I said, you are yet to show me any proof at all.
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:55:58
Wouldn't it be a complete legal nightmare for Valve to sort out all the local jurisdictions? 
There's a reason they sell region-restricted licenses, accepting bitcoin would totally circumvent this.
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:22:34


Fucking toplel broski
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:40:55
The fact that you have to pay a fee, even though people keep saying bitcoin has no fees.
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:07:29
In what way is bitcoin more fair? If anything the distribution will be even more skewed.
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:25:22
You can hardly call that a comparison.
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:04:43
The only changetips I've seen on Youtube are on Bitcoin related videos, and they all were only a few cents. I would imagine this Soundcloud integration will be even more unnoticable as Soundcloud itself is such a minor service compared to Youtube/Facebook.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:16:49
That seems like a huge hassle.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:37:07
Talking about bitcoin would be social suicide at my university.
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:50:42
You can be interested in bitcoin even though you don't "believe in it".
@_date: 2014-12-09 23:05:02
Ok, but not a single one of those can be considered a "troll comment". They are perhaps talking about the shortcomings of bitcoin and its community, but in no way are they "trolling".
Please remember that just because I'm not circlejerking doesn't mean I'm trolling. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:58:41
The only reason price matters is because people want to get rich off bitcoin.
Real bitcoin believers understand that the price is not relevant at all.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:37:07
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:33:36
Bitcoin went on sale today, but only if you're a fucking moron.
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:32:39
is not the place for citations. Go elsewhere if you want to have a fact based and objective discussion.
  
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:22:17
How is this bitcoin related?
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:34:43
Yes. $100 @_date: 2014-08-27 00:19:04
That sure sounds sustainable.
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:31:25


@_date: 2014-09-05 00:19:33
Yes. It will be pretty fucking difficult to drastically improve upon the already existing online payment methods. It can't get much easier than 1-click purchases.
What is your point?
@_date: 2016-01-02 00:55:02
Because this would be classified as a shitpost on any proper subreddit.
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:19:16
Or you could've used Paypal.
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:48:05
I think the majority of likes Bitcoin to at least some degree. If you take a closer look at the content of that Subreddit you'll see that the jokes are focused on the delusional bitcoin fanatics, not the technology itself. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 05:35:59
I just can't believe people are still endorsing Purse even though they know it's all based on credit card fraud. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:42:41
You could sell your CS:GO skins for btc.
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:23:25
Well the the hell is it then, if not a name for the currency?
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:21:12
Luckily all modern banks offer a CC/Debit card combination where both options support chip and pin. So bitcoin still really doesn't help at all in this situation, besides, chip and PIN will be implemented to every store way before bitcoin will.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:27:47
Yes it's possible.
@_date: 2016-01-04 01:50:09
Nice counterargument.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:04:24
Can someone please explain how the fuck this is news and how the fuck this is related to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:41:00
The second problem is that the fees are really negligible. I'd say the majority of people are fine with paying 0,5% for having the possibility of using a credit card, and 0,3% for paying with a debit card.
The funny thing is that it's actually way more expensive to pay with bitcoin that with fiat at this point.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:56:49
It's a bit different when there's financial interests involved.
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:39:22
3000 bits! Wow!
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:31:20
It's pretty safe to say that coinbase is very overvalued at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:54:36


Both. To purchase the required gear, the time to set up everything properly and the time to educate all employees to use the new system.
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:26:59
Bitcoin looks familiar if you change the years into days.
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:07:25
They have selected McNiP, McHeaton and McFragite in a similar contest ran in Sweden.  NiP actually ran a pretty sizeable marketing campaign around their burger as well together with McDonalds.  So it's not really a waste of time.

Because that's totally how it works.
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:54:55
It's getting real euphoric here.
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:00:02
It most likely is, the method just hasn't been discovered yet.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:57:13
Then maybe they should read the rules of reddit? "Normal" people get shadowbanned for stuff like this all the time, just because Andreas has tons of fanboys doesn't mean he's above the rules.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:18:21
Banning him for vote brigading is perfectly justified.
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:50:32
That's almost as sad as [this.](
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:40:10
Yes, he sure was such a jackass for banning people that break the rules.
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:24:34
Credit card companies in Europe have already solved the problems you're having.
When using your CC in a store you need to input a PIN code to authorize each purchase, so what happened to you can't happen anymore. And when shopping online you also need to either input a PIN code or use 2FA, so even if the thief knows your CC number and CVV they can't do anything with it.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:43:48
You forgot to tip your fedora.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:11:28
This thread is like a whole new level of crazy. It's actually quite scary that there are people like this out there. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:10:03
Exactly. There's only good new for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:12:50
And they're both declining, just like the price. It's almost as if there's a correlation.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:22:26
$299 looks really cheap right now.
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:26:45
So because we're in means that we shouldn't criticize or mention the obvious shortcomings of bitcoin? Are you fucking retarded?
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:33:01
Ironic, considering bitcoin will be inflationary for the next 120 years.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:28:05
OP has to be a troll, he just has to.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:38:42
The problem here is that I pay 0 fees to my bank. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:11:00


That is not the case anymore. You deposit $100, you get $100.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:06:11
Looks like you got scammed.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:51:36
It's very arguable that there's actually a demand for this. The upvote system alone makes for a very cancerous community, promoting only low effort content. Now imagine how shitty this place would become if there were financial interests involved.
During the changetip circlejerk week on this subreddit was pretty intolerable, tipping cents to people in random subreddits also paints a pretty embarrassing picture of the Reddit community.
We should really think twice before we start wishing for btc integration.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:45:36
It's because is insanely insecure, so any mention in the mainstream media is considered huge.
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:51:54


Right, let's move the goal posts again. You were just talking about " Wow! That's it" which is obviously a reference to how a paying customer perceives the process of paying with bitcoin. 
But now since you realized both cash and NFC payments are way faster than bitcoin you try to change the topic again. I guess that was expected though, as nothing obviously can't be better than bitcoin.
Come back when paying with bitcoin is as fast as paying with NFC, otherwise this is just totally pointless as the facts have already proved you wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:16:23
As long as you tip more than a few dollars it's fine. But tipping something like 100 bits is just laughable.
@_date: 2014-05-30 00:41:39
But AFAIK bitcoin is not yet able to unrustle jimmies as proven by your comment history.
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:11:54
You do realize making a product cool is innovation as well? That's kind of the point of innovation actually. Using existing technology to create something new that is adopted by a totally new customer base.
Before the iPhone the average user didn't care about touchscreens, but when Apple innovated how a touchscreen can be used on a mobile interface they managed to attract even the most "casual user" to use their products. If that isn't innovation, I don't know what is.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:31:18


Then how come the majority of valid bitcoin criticism gets downvoted every single time?


Then how come every negative comment towards bitcoin always gets downvoted, doesn't matter if it's sensible or not.


Even though Andreas didn't specifically say to downvote everything anti-bitcoin, it was pretty obviously implied.
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:21:07
The derivative market will always exist, no matter what currency you use.


It's much easier as there is no regulation set in place. Remember that only a small fraction of all bitcoin related transactions happen on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:05:03
I was mainly making fun of how inconvenient this is by being sarcastic. I guess it didn't translate over to text that well.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:43:07
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:07:49
Just goes to show that we should probably take everything Andreas says with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:48:53
I'm very interested in seeing a fingerprint scanner that's more secure than a bank vault.

in a nutshell.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:30:33
TL;DR only post good news because that makes me feel better.
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:37:38


Bitcoin doesn't have much going for it if those are the main arguments.
The security is shit for the bitcoin consumer, it's barely cheaper, don't know what you mean by "censor proof".  But it is faster, only in international transactions, though.
Money has been global for decades now, bitcoin isn't really anything new in that regard.
Saying there's no barriers to entry is also a bit of a stretch. You have to go through quite a few processes before you can get your first BTC.


That will eventually be a problem that bitcoin needs to solve as well.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:08:03
Deflation does not work with an "all or nothing" principle. There's absolutely no reason for there to be "companies making zero dollars from accepting btc" just because the economy is deflationary.
Also FYI, there are companies that make zero dollars from accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:37:08
We are talking about McDonalds.
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:59:15
I really hope no one does this.
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:05:46
Cool to see unrelated shit being posted to @_date: 2015-01-11 01:28:33
I didn't know there are adults who use only their first name as a signature.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:29:42
No, but it's pretty obvious if you have a look at what gets downvoted.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:59:57
In what ways exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:16:40
Shitposting at its finest.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:12:11
Following the trends it looks like bitcoiners will need their 2 bits more than the kids with malaria.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:57:03
And what happens after you've bought every bitcoin and there's no more demand? Yeah, the price drops to 0.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:33:38
Sorry, should've said
TL;DR Only circlejerk
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:32:50
Could someone explain how this is bitcoin related?
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:59:58
No, that's not at all what it means. They think coinbase is undervalued, not bitcoin. Otherwise they'd be investing in bitcoin, which they obviously aren't.
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:22:07
Could you point me towards the FUD in the comment? Everything he says is correct.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:52:39
Isn't this vote brigading? 
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:46:32
Would you ever consider giving someone a 2€ gift voucher? No? Then you shouldn't give 2€ worth of bitcoin either. It will just make you look cheap and desperate.
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:00:23
The problem is that the moment they implement "Fingerprint+password" it is no longer easier to use than a CC, which seems to be the whole point of it.
@_date: 2015-01-01 08:34:51
Currently it looks like we are stuck in a slow downward trend at ~300. So $200 at the end of the year seems like a pretty safe bet as there is currently no reason for the price to go up. It's also important to remember that the utility of bitcoin is not dependent on the price level, so it doesn't really matter what the price is.
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:33:54
The future is here!
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:41:09


Every decent bank offers 2FA on every offline/online credit/debit transaction, so setting that up shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:02:41


That unfortunately not how deflation works.
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:08:23
Fuck, I honestly can't tell if you're trolling or if you're actually this fucking narrow minded.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:10:28
What exactly are they hedging with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:49:24
See your comment just makes bitcoin look worse, not fiat.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:39:45
But your statement is still wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:06:00
Chip and pin CCs stop you from getting charged twice. So bitcoin isn't really needed.
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:58:21


It's pretty impressive that bitcoin managed to depreciate almost as much in just under a year!
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:51:53
That would make sense if you plan on living another 120 years. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:35:38
The first thing to fixing a problem is admitting you have one. Works both for bitcoin and you.
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:21:32
Well, they created ApplePay. And currently it seems that a huge amount of retailers and credit card companies are interested in adopting the technology. So Apple basically made NFC mainstream.
Sure NFC has been on Android and WP for years, but no one ever used it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:06:42
Concervative advice? "Bitcoin could be worth 100k one day"
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:32:55
Or maybe even "Wow!? Like NFC payments but slower!?"
The process of paying with bitcoin is really not that revolutionary at all. The technology is, however.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:44:08
As long as you keep in mind how strong the fundamentals of bitcoin are, you won't be bothered by the price. It's obvious that a technology this great simply will not remain this cheap long term.
The price is dropping only because weak hands are selling. True believers will be rewarded, trust me.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:10:57
Oh god, please tell me you aren't being serious.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:09:17
Do you realize how stupid you sound? Imagine if bitcoin wasn't "piggy backing off the USD". No one would care about bitcoin if that was the case.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:13:23
That's most likely because people don't really comprehend what fractional reserve banking is. 
The fact that anyone even remotely hinting at it being beneficial gets instantly downvoted isn't exactly helping the situation either.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:42:10
Just browse around for a bit and I'm sure you'll find lots of evidence. I mean if a mod whose "job" is to browse this reddit says so, then the odds are he's right.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:07:32
Nope, those terminals are used just in a few countries. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:39:20

@_date: 2015-01-07 04:45:21


I hope you're just being sarcastic.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:42:27
We have to remember that according to everyone who criticizes btc is a troll. So Andreas basically asked the community to downvote every negative comment.
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:54:18
This is so fucking sad.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:19:54
He obviously didn't mean solely in the literal sense.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:25:21
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:45:52
To be fair, everyone believing in "Willy" are fucking idiots, too.
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:51:00
To be completely honest, nothing. The only place where bitcoin has an advantage are the illegal markets, outside of them I prefer using PayPal.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:22:42
I agree with what you're saying, the problem is that the majority of disagrees with you.


Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:08:35
That's not really relevant as he was still breaking the rules of Reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:53:40
But the price has been falling for a year even though everything you mentioned is happening. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:04:17
Investors could be heavily overvaluing all bitcoin related companies.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:35:26
That doesn't change the fact that the supply will be increasing for the next 120 years. Your statement remains false no matter how you look at it.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:47:28
It can look cheap even though it costs a lot.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:26:51
I guess she has never shopped online before. Scanning a QR code with your phone is pretty damn inconvenient when compared to one-click solutions by Google and Paypal, or even Applepay.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:42:45


You are saying that like you're sure about it, even though it's 100% speculation.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:21:23
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:40:23
What's up with all these purchase justification posts recently?
@_date: 2014-11-15 10:43:58
You should know the process already.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:19:50
Maybe you are the one who should closer at the timeline. The supply over time will be increasing for the next 120 years. 
So saying "The price is a moving target but the supply over time is not." is straight up incorrect.

Considering every modern POS system and phone comes with NFC these days that really isn't a problem. Same can not be said for technology needed for accepting bitcoin.


Paying with bitcoin is much, much slower than paying with NFC. It literally takes a second to pay with nfc but you probably wouldn't know as you're just here to troll.

Unfortunately not having a fractional reserve results in the fees being way higher than your average bank.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:06:55


But the blockchain was already "cracked" 4 years ago.
As I said, "pretty much identical". So not entirely the same. There are differences sure, but it still works largely in the same way for the consumer. 
Anonymous payments being the biggest difference, but because that's only an interesting feature to a very small fraction of the worlds population it really isn't that relevant. It's a great feature, sure. But it isn't important to the average Joe.

Keep in mind that everyone is allowed to have a debit card, which can be used online;essentially replacing the Credit Cards functions.
The people who "don't believe in credit" are also people who most likely use a debit card with the same functions as a CC minus the credit part.
The initial verification for Coinbase is a huge pain in the ass for the average consumer. Why do it when you might as well buy using a CC?


That's quite a stupid assumption. Credit cards are used in every single country, in no way are they exclusive to the US.


But why bother doing this if you can just use a debit/credit card? Again, it seems like something only bitcoin fanatics would do just to say they've purchased something with btc.


I misspoke, I meant cash as in current assets, not so much the physical form of currency.
But all in all, it still seems that the only reason to use btc is because of the 3% discount. I guess if you want to sacrifice convenience for a very small discount, then gyft might actually be a viable payment method. But for the average Joe this will never be an option.
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:03:14


Banks don't give a fuck what currency you use. They'll make just as much money using btc as fiat.

You need an organization with the available balance to give the loan. Private persons will not be able to offer hundreds of millions of dollars like banks can.

Wikipedia was never perceived as crazy, just unreliable. 
It is still considered unreliable in the academic world, and you are not allowed to cite anything from that site. So I honestly don't see why you are trying to make this comparison.
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:29:24


Exactly the same way as the 2008 crash did. Just replace the word mortgage with bitcoin.


Manipulating loans are not the problem. Giving out loans to people not being able to pay back is the issue.
The main culprit for the crash was the derivative market, which will exist no matter what the underlying asset is. Beit bitcoin or mortgages.

The same 3 parties will be involved when the BTC is converted back into fiat. So the fees will probably remain the same.

@_date: 2015-07-29 20:41:41

None. All of them are so fucking enlightened by their own intelligence anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:28:51


That's a pretty fucking ironic thing for you to say.
Can you please tell me how there are so many 30+% discounts offered on purse.io, and why is it always the high discount purchases that are getting cancelled by Amazon?
Do you honestly believe there are that many people who sell $500 gift cards for 30% discounts just to get their hands on some bitcoin? When they instead could use alternative services and get 95% of the face value in fiat?
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:56:27
It's also good to keep in mind that the 25-30% discounts are possible because of credit card fraud, and it is likely that Amazon will cancel the gift card leaving you with nothing.

 And is it really worth buying phones and tablets with the sole purpose of storing bitcoin on them? After all, registering a google account to enable the appstore would be a massive privacy risk.

Not relevant at all. This argument barely belongs to bitcoin vs. fiat, even less here.


Not true. OB will most likely not succeed because customers are always at a disadvantage when using the platform. There is no guarantee of receiving the product, making every transaction unnecessarily risky.
I would never order anything online if there was a risk of not receiving your money back in case of a scam, especially if there are already multiple services that can offer you this guarantee.

OpenBazaar is obviously better from the sellers perspective. 
But think of the buyer, who would you ever give up all the safety nets for the sake of using bitcoin? Ebay and other platforms are so popular because the buyer can always feel safe with his money, the same can never be said about OB.

The difference is that they can just ban bitcoin from being accepted at any legit business.
No business owner wants to risk their future just because of a currency. And then, why use bitcoin if it isn't accepted anywhere?
Edit: Instead of downvoting me, could you give some arguments as to why people want to illegally accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:03:41
But you do agree that it's a step back when you shouldn't "keep large amounts of Bitcoin or private keys on Internet connected devices". ?
Currently people can store all of their cash online without practically any risk, starting to use bitcoin would basically bring us back to the pre-internet era in terms of convenience.

Right. So pay for something you have already paid for, sounds great.

It is already commonplace in most of Europe. But instead of paying 5 cents you pay nothing.

The probem is that it really isn't faster at all from the customers POV.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:24:48
Wow! So convenient!
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:22:27




To be fair, that is a fairly accurate description of the bitcoin community as well.
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:22:49
In exchange for what?
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:14:19


Why not offer a 10% discount for purchases made with USD too? After all, the dollar might eventually increase 10% in value.
@_date: 2015-04-17 11:24:25
You should bring up NFC payments too. Credit cards have had contactless payments in most of Europe for years already, and it's much easier and faster than using QR codes.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:01:04
Of course they pay for power, but how do you know they pay for it with the bitcoin they mined?
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:41:03
Yes, that's assuming miners sell all of the mined bitcoins, which they don't do.
I was asking you for a source for the statement that miners sell coins to cover the power cost, which you have so far failed to provide.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:30:52
Such as?
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:09:29
And here I thought bitcoin couldn't be stopped by the government.
@_date: 2015-09-26 09:40:14
You honestly believe that's also how big companies implement a new payment method?

@_date: 2015-09-25 22:15:27
It's actually very plausible that it costs more. 
After all, you have to split the fixed costs and setup costs, not to mention the transaction costs with the small amount of bitcoin users on that site.
@_date: 2016-10-18 07:19:08
That's surprisingly expensive compared to modern banking. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:23:57
Aren't all laws arbitrary?
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:34:37
Yes, but could you link me to the source of your statement?
@_date: 2016-10-29 16:21:38
Because price is not an indicator of success.
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:13:20
That is assuming miners sell all of their coins every day, which they don't.
@_date: 2015-11-18 14:59:52
Pretty much everyone uses a service that enables you to skip typing in the CC number. Be it google wallet, paypal or just a password container. 
Alternatively you could just use Samsung/Apple Pay or whatever Googles comparable app is called. That way you don't even need to scan a QR code. 
So what I'm basically saying here is that bitcoin is already beat in terms of speed and convenience.  Not to mention the aforementioned options offer consumer protection, and they're actually accepted somewhere. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 08:44:35
That's not really anything new, though. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:42:58

@_date: 2015-03-08 19:53:22
That 5% is still way cheaper than what it would cost with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:11:00


Yes. It's instant and free, and can be done by using the banks website or mobile application. I can send money instantly by just knowing the persons telephone number or IBAN.
Edit: Thanks for downvoting facts.
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:39:07
Alternatively you can use a bank that isn't ripping you off. Keep in mind that for bitcoin to succeed we need "bitcoin banks" so this problem wouldn't even necessarily disappear if bitcoin was to get popular.
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:54:09


Every time I've been at a casino I've used a bank card. Never had any problems.

How is buying bitcoin, pulling out your phone, opening the app, scanning the code; in any way simpler than using a password containers CC number feature which only requires you to type in a password?
Note that these password containers come preinstalled on most modern browsers.

It would be quite easy for countries to ban bitcoin, though.

In this case buying bitcoin in the hopes of getting a profit is just pure gambling, as there seems to be no reason behind the price hike.

Having withdrawal fees is already very outdated, most banks are trying to move away from them.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:55:08
But by using this you are essentially going CC-&gt; Coinbase -&gt; Shift -&gt;Purchase instead of the normal CC -&gt; Purchase
I mean if you enjoy paying extra fees and paying with pseudo-bitcoin then sure, this might be nice. For all we know there might actually be no real bitcoin involved in this process.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:34:16
What exactly is the point of this? Why wouldn't I get a normal CC instead of this hassle?
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:59:38
Many European casinos accept debit card payments. I usually buy my chips at the counter, but you can also more chips using the payment terminals at the tables. 
Not once have I used cash at a casino. Of course you can't buy with credit, but debit is fine. I could upload a picture of the debit card statement, but you wouldn't believe me anyway.

Just because there is a risk of loss doesn't mean it's gambling. 
There is a massive difference between buying bitcoin and a share of a company.

It's also called a "bubble".
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:09:37
Of course you are allowed to want your investments to grow.


Never said I didn't. I would love to see bitcoin get more popular.
 But when people start evangelizing bitcoin like it's the best invention ever, completely ignoring all its shortcomings and trying to skew all negative news into positive it becomes pretty weird. This would never happen if there weren't financial interests involved.
It's actually pretty disugsting when passionate bitcoiners try to trap their family/friends/business associates to invest by spewing out false information in an attempt to boost the value of their investment.
Just think, how many of us would be this passionate about popularizing bitcoin if the btc price was fixed at $1?
Of course everything I just mentioned applies for all other stocks and assets with growth potential, but somehow this phenomenon is painfully visible in the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-05-27 09:57:27
It's not meant to be. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:57:57
Is there any reason for the price to be rising?
E: Based on the replies, it seems this is just yet another bubble as no one has had any decent explanation as to why bitcoin should now be more valuable.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:57:36
Are we really so delusional that we think bitcoin will ever be even remotely as big as the internet?
I mean let's be real. The "sending money" problem has already been solved in modern countries.

No. All the major banks in the region cooperate with Swish and offer instant transactions.

It may very well be a solution to the rest of the world. The bank industry is constantly being modernized. An EU-wide "Swish" is certainly not out of the picture.
It's currently just a very succesful proof of concept, which definitely can and will be scaled up.
Bitcoin needs to grow really fast, otherwise it will be overshadowed by these other services.


I don't see the problem with that.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:16:31
Yeah, banks in the Nordic countries are pretty damn great. I use Nordea, it's a Scandinavian bank. The app used to send money instantly is called Swish or MobilePay.
The fact that these options already exist makes bitcoin much more unattractive in the eyes of the average user.
 Why would they bother with bitcoin when they might as well use their local currency completely free of charge? Not to mention the added security you get by having a bank insure all your transactions.
Yes, bitcoin is better when dealing with international transactions. But the fact is that the majority will never have the need to send money across country borders. Sending money within EU is also pretty convenient with SEPA.
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:04:02
Please stop comparing the internet to bitcoin. The internet was something completely new, whereas bitcoin is just set to replace existing technology.


There is no way to say whether bitcoin will succeed to gain mainstream adoption.
It's also important to remember that all this potential innovation you're talking about is in no way bitcoin exclusive, but banks and altcoins can easily adapt these innovations to their existing solutions. In a way bitcoin is already getting outphased by the most modern banks.

As I already previously mentioned, we are talking about the average user. Most people never need to send money internationally. Free, instant and secure domestic transactions are more than enough for the average person.
It's only a matter of time these services get international, making bitcoin basically useless. Because why go through the trouble of acquiring bitcoin if you can just use an app instead?
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:37:37
I agree. It's inevitable that banks will increase their cooperation if bitcoin were to start gaining popularity. 
It would only be a matter of time these instant transactions were offered internationally (almost) free of charge between all major banks.
I consider bitcoin to be a catalyst for these global transactions, but I doubt bitcoin will be able to sustain a decent share when banks start to seriously ramp up the competition.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:14:39

This is from a consumer standpoint obviously.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:47:03
Right, so if bitcoin gets adopted by the mainstream then bitcoin-based banks will acquire most of the control fiat banks currently have.
For bitcoin not to be "cumbersome" it needs 3rd party organizations that essentially replace todays banks, meaning people just give the power to another organization.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:54:33

@_date: 2015-02-01 11:17:05
What is it then? Gambling?
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:54:34
No credit card information was stolen, though. So bitcoin users are just as affected as credit card users.
@_date: 2015-02-24 02:47:01
You do realize that all of those points actually argue aganst bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:44:42
I fucking can't believe this comment got upvoted.
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:57:36
That's a very sound investment strategy you have. No wonder people laugh at bitcoiners.
@_date: 2015-02-21 02:39:48
What are these "up movements" you're talking about?
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:14:01
You should move to a modern country. Pretty much everyone in the nordic countries accepts NFC payments, whereas bitcoin is nowhere to be seen.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:38:00
You really think that's a valid idea?
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:11:34
Right. Troll because I'm pointing out facts.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:02:58
One could argue it's a pointless comparison to compare bitcoin-&gt;bitcoin with fiat-&gt;fiat as the world will never transition into using bitcoin only.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:59:32
It's getting real euphoric in here.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:19:53


What the fuck dude?
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:41:00


Yeah, it's not like that hasn't happened before.


The moment the US gets modernized is the moment bitcoin gets pretty much useless from a B2C perspective. In the nordic countries I seriously see no smart use case for bitcoin for the consumer.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:04:31
Exactly. But I don't have any plans on using gold as a currency, as it is very inconvenient to spend and risky to store it yourself. Just like bitcoin currently.
Gold is surprisingly similar to bitcoin, even though loves to hate on it.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:57:05
Because that's how you convince all the doubters. I mean you can't honestly claim that bitcoin is as revolutionary as the internet, so comparing the two is pretty damn stupid.
If bitcoin was introduced the same time as the internet, then I would agree with you.
Do you not realize how fucking stupid it is that the safest way to store your "online currency" is by having it offline, completely disconnected from the internet? One can hardly call that revolutionary or convenient.
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:15:04
How do you pay with bitcoin faster than with an NFC payment? I just don't get it.
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:23:09


What the fuck? So because I'm not mindlessly circlejerking bitcoin makes me a buttcoiner?
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:21:17
I never knew it was considered mental to point out facts, and correct false assumptions. I will try not to do that in the future.
@_date: 2016-07-15 05:05:04
Why would we want to hide one of bitcoins biggest strengths?
@_date: 2016-07-20 19:13:52
BTC is not being positively compared to anything. She is saying that GBP has dropped to the level of BTC, which she considers to be a shit-tier "currency".
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:23:47
If she has inherited your intelligence she won't have any chances of getting into Standford, so no need to worry.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:52:11
Ever heard of a thing called a "Credit card"?  By using this mythical object you are in fact able to travel to multiple countries without the need to worry about currency exchanges.
@_date: 2015-02-14 02:29:11
Unfortunately no one of us will be alive to see bitcoin challenging that, as btc will be inflationary for the next 140 years.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:02:23
Yes. Decentralization is the whole point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:13:43
Well that sounds pretty fucking stupid.
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:43:45
Excellent point.
At this point it's obvious that bitcoin is the way to go for each of the countries you mentioned.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:48:25
Not comparable at all, but alright. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 10:51:47
Yes, but why are they doing that?
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:40:04
You think the EU will collapse in 2 years?
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:37:05


Just because you don't agree doesn't mean it's ignorant.
 PS. Make the world a better place and kill yourself.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:42:04


But when inflation stops, the transactions fees will have rise heavily and that is not currently included in your calculation.
Frankly, your "comparison" is misleading at best.
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:31:53
Because it would be worth a lot more now, not because of the currency itself.
@_date: 2015-02-14 02:26:42
Shilling at its finest.
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:17:59
What Allen means with her tweet is that GBP is currently in such a bad state that even Bitcoin is more stable. She's talking about GBP in a negative light by comparing it to, in her eyes, a shit currency.
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:57:26
Reminds me of @_date: 2015-02-01 17:05:22
lol. Are you really this delusional?
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:35:05
How is this bitcoin related? Is the manure symbolic for bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:46:18
But the comparison is utter shit, and doesn't tell us anything. You can't just pick two random values and start comparing them to fit your agenda.
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:41:57
Yeah... Collapsing...
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:32:12
Comparing market cap to assets is a pretty odd thing to do.
Plus you forgot that the current bitcoin fee structure is based on the fee+new bitcoins mined. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:29:34
You really believe that?
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:44:37
:DDD Fuck off troll
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:16:36
Hedging against inflation by buying an inflational currency? What?
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:47:28
The Euro is slightly more stable, and doesn’t rely on a single country, though. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:51:07
Probably not. Streaming services are the future, and bitcoin is currently struggling with recurring payments.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:59:36
That's not the same at all. Visa is comparable to Bitpay whereas bitcoin is comparable to USD.
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:51:01
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:43:53


The currency of the future!
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:55:39
Yeah, so hard to send a text message.
