Nobody will make it but us

This is a two part question; the honorable doesn't answer those. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:59:36
The violation begins immediately

A: Traders looking to make a buck
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:39:59
Oh ho ho, spoke too soon!
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:11:31
And how. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:33:31
Haha... Ouch. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:22:01
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:02:32
Will these numbers stay valid for long?
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:37:10
You guys are uncle and nephew!! 
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:16:42
Same. Let's tear down those proprietary walls :) 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:41:07
We can't all allow ourselves to descend to that level of scumbaggery

"Enjoy the stability?" You're right! If you want the stability that your dollar amount of savings gives you- the rock solid feeling that every night, without fail, you can close your eyes and wake up to the rush of having less money than you did 6 hours ago- now if that's the kind of service you're looking to get from your money, then sir, let me tell you this dollar product is just the store of currency you're looking for. No need to examine the other models, those 'joke options' that actually give you more buying power over time. Nope, nothing stable about that! Now let's go in the back and I can write you up your legal duties, restrictions and obligations for holding the US dollar, plus I'll get your fingerprint, ID and SS numbers while we're back there, to make sure you never have to be bothered to come in again. Unless we need or want you. In that case, we'll find you. And we'll take all your money.

"Jose Gonzales"... Living in Texas makes that jump right out at you
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:00:34
Seriously. What stated is that the price keeps going up, and thus he doesn't want to jump on board. Haha okay, buddy, just stick to the trading strategies that have gotten you thus far. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:59:59
Then I don't think 'crash' was what really happened on Gox.. perhaps there is a more accurate word for it
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:57:52
I am a member of the FSF and have worked with licenses in the past, has anybody reported this alleged violation? We need to bring this to blockchain's attention and see how they're going to handle this. [steps](
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:02:47
I could write one for you for a BTC tip. I use Bitcoin paranoid, however this doesn't sound like what you are asking for. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:00:45
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:02:34
Rules are for fools, rules are for fools 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:17:54
No, you are correct. This is why we are waiting to see the response. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:56:12
Now, to make a Japanese account.. or at the very least, fly there, make some, and peddle to the more affluent on this sub..
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:55:58
This is my plan too. "But... your entertainment budget!" I will put that on hold. Staring at these charts is entertaining enough for me :) I'll see you on that cheesey cratered face brethen
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:35:56
Wouldn't you worry about somebody snatching your coins pre mortem? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:21:21
What happens when many governments start to hoard Bitcoin? There's no point in hoarding without eventually selling.. foes this mean exaggerated periods of high (during hoarding) and lows (selling)? Not many individuals have the lower to adjust the market like Unkle Sam 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:53:52
Augh, man, it only gets creepy when we admit how creepy we are. We could have rode this train halfway to Volgograd before you derailed us
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:58:49
But that's math.. math does the same thing over and over. This is where part of the beauty comes from. You can't try to land a spaceship on the moon (pardon the comparison) and NOT look at charts of projectile motion.. all of which obey the same curve. It's the lay of the territory, sorry @_date: 2013-12-10 06:25:16
Very pertinent disclosure. Thank you
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:50:53
Good call. Facebook takes steps to track everybody with these comments and ads, not just facebook users. As such, in addition to not having a FB account I block all FB hosts in my /etc/hosts file. 
Woe be unto those who downvote you. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:12:22
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:23:25
Perhaps you two are speaking of differently sized boats 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:15:04
Is it... Just like this?? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:52:25
Delete post ? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:17:26
Yep, May 2013. A good start though, if anybody googles I'd enjoy a post
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:42:37
Time for EVERYONE to abandon SourceForge. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:55:10
Hell no!
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:25:41
Can't blow all of it on lunches like I did when I was a kid!
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:20:47
Proof? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:52:39
This we still do not know... no source.
Keep your foil hats on til the very end, gentlemen.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:22:26
I would love to code with you
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:09:05
I like the sound of this. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that question, can you give me some context? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:49:17
Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:13:56
My grandma has expressed interest too.. 
Take note, target demographic has risen by 40 years
