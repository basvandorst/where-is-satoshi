When some girls get in bad moods they go shopping.  So maybe you should just buy more bitcoin.  Bam �� problem solver! That’s me.  Bitcoin is big! And is only going to become bigger with time. Remember it’s a long term investment. Quit looking at the price and what it does. Just be patient.

I’ll buy it for some digibyte.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:23:11
Then would digibyte actually have around 22 quadrillion max supply?

My first sale was in 2013.  My second sale was 4 years later.  It was the best Christmas a family could ask for.   Amen.  I truly believe in bitcoin and it’s foundation. I have watched it everyday since the beginning. I love new �� 
I had same feelings for Bitcoin. That I had about the internet way back when.  I feel I might do another sale in 2021 to be honest I’m thinking 100k a coin. It will be hard for me to pass and let it ride for another 6years if by 2021 it hits those numbers. I will not sale all.  I will keep 20.  Back then it was hard to get bitcoin.  Luckily I found a miner on a forum and we worked out a deal.  God bless bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-06-03 16:41:36
Why the drop.  And now financial institutions are talking about buying DigiByte??? What is DigiByte?? And why would that be the coin of choice?
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:49:46
Get a bitfi and hold
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:44:23

He lives with his mom and pays her $200 a month to live with her. So he invested a total $600 and is now crying to mommy cause he doesn’t have her rent money.  Lol poor baby needs a diaper change.  And some milk from mommy.  BTC will hit $11k within a month. Just relax and suck that milk from your mommies teet.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:53:59
Or maybe you couldn’t afford to buy any bitcoin cause you spent all your dough on weed. Whatever the case may be  your a plague of negative energy and will not go far in life with that attitude and judgmental comments.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:05:40

It’s .05903 bitcoin times it by 12 you have about $211 profit. Minus your fees so my guess is $170 total if you sold at 12k so if you invested 5k just times the .05803 by ten now and you’ll have about $2100 profit at 12k.  Truly learn to use a calculator.  Its actually really easy math.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:24:34
Good BUY. It will jump to 11k within the month.

He is %1000 right. I believe him and I don’t think he is mad.  I have gotten a sign from nowhere. Call it God call it what you will.  But I talked about time travel and John McAfee at the same time this was written then got home and read it. 
I am now a believer that he is right and his prediction will be right on.  WOW.  Mind blown.  
I am being %100 honest. This really just happened. I promise.  I am truthful and would not make this up... I hope that everyone deserving gets in as much as they can on Bitcoin now.  Bless the good.  
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:00:04
According to my calculations. Bitcoin should rise 4.32% within the next three days then drop 1.8% then rise 8.6% then drop 4% then rise 15.9%.
My calculations are always 100% correct don’t take this information to heart.  just take it as it is. and hold. For the sun rise is coming.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:01:30

Ripple off is trash. It’s a centerpiece of junk inside celebrities homes. You are being sold by celebrities who want to make money off you.  
Aston Dushner or Ellen Degenerat. They are both two reasons of why never fall for the con.  Of XRP
BITCOIN life!
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:32:33
Wow big response. I’m just happy with one for now. Have it locked up on a nano ledger and in safety security box. I think it will be safe.   Thanks for the concerns. Much love to everyone in the crypto world.  God bless and amen.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:46:09

I don’t smoke. I’m drug free. Just happy. Sounds like you sold your bitcoin.  Or never had any.  Lol.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:37:26
