Minning is used in the consus system to allow clients to pick between two vaild chains should a fork be seen. The point is that the chains need to be valid, these rules are defined in the bitcoin client.
Basically miners help ensure we all use the blockchain that is difficult for an attacker to manipulate eg censorship double spends ect, if this begins to change it is the responsibility of the economic majority to change the rules in the client.
Bitcoin is more decentralized when more people participate, that is running full nodes and even holding bitcoin make it more resilient.
Minning centralization is a problem, it's just not a really big problem, because it can be fixed.

Wow what a toxic attitude, no wonder bitcoiners are starting to get a bad reputation. Your comment reminds me of the initial reactions banks and governments had toward bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:15:01
If the fork occurs you will have accounts in both chains. So it's not outside your control.  I also propose not changing the proof of work.
Also most people don't trust machines, because machines are built by people. But people can agree to a common protocol. Blindly following a protocol you don't agree with that is set my a single dev team is not decentralization.
I don't see what's wrong without people wanting a different protocol creating their own chain, so what if this chain is forked of the bitcoin chain at some point? 
Are you saying every alt coin is an attack on bitcoin? Because that's what the fork will result in. At least with this method you don't have to deal with the pre-mine insta mine bs...
@_date: 2016-08-31 21:56:32
We could fork bitcoin and call it litecoin, and bitcoin will continue to exist. I could fork it right now and create my own alt coin and nobody would care...
The blockchain is about empowering a group of people who agree to build shared decentralized system eg bitcoin. If half of the people in the group decide they don't like the direction of the original dev team, should they be forced to use that chain?
Those people will either leave for alts; using another blockchain, or fork the current blockchain to create a new protocol which they agree with. The economic majority will determine which chain has more value.
The ability for people to fork and walk away make bitcoin decentralized and resistant to manipulation. Otherwise everyone would be at the mercy of bitcoin core and the Chinese miners.
Bitcoin can the forked, pretending it can't to attract new users is lying and will only benfit u in the short term.
Of course the media will laugh at bitcoin when it forks, but this is because people haven't got used to the paradigm of decentralized system. 
If we are to achieve main stream adoption of the blockchain systems helping people understated why being able to fork is a strength of a decentralized system is the way to go.

well it would be good if we can complain to the CA, until their cert is revoked.
I think it would be cool if the blockchain could be used to solve this problem. So people could trust a website cert and their vote is based on how much bitcoin they own. Then when you visit website your browser could verify the cert and then check the blockchain to see if the cert was trusted. If the total capital trusting domain is lower than a certain threshold, show a warning. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:29:20
Well we would publish the fingerprint onto the blockchain, in a signed message by a private key associated with a know bitcoin address. I am assuming the bitcoin private key is secured. Eg msg could be, ... I am satoshi verify the binary has this fingerprint 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964 plz love satoshi...
People can verify the msg was signed by satoshis key and once this is done you know you can verify the binary against that fingerprint. Now you are trusting the capital behind the key used to sign the message, instead of a website.

@_date: 2016-08-30 03:42:24
A fork is not an attack on the blockchain, it would be equivalent to creating a new alt coin and importing  the bitcoin history.
A fork occurs when the protocol in the client is changed, therefore some of network will operate on their own. What's wrong with this? 
Conceptually you could argue every time the protocol changes a fork occurs, it just those forks aren't controversial.

hmm instead of selling it maybe they should use it to bail out bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:04:54
I am actually OK with this, there are two conflicting approaches on how to scale bitcoin. We should agree to disagree  and just fork. Then there will be a new alt coin where bitcoin users also have funds. What I don't want to see is petty ddos attacks and attempted 51% attacks on the new chain.
If the new chain has greater economic support it will have a larger proof of work security in the long-run. 
I think this is the best approach, staying together will make both communities toxic.
This is the point of a blockchain, you can agree to disagree!

The number of transactions is caped by the blocksize, therefore so is the total amount of fees you could collect. You might say fees could increase, they could but only up to a certain level before people stop using bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-07-17 07:39:06
Mining pools admins run a full node they control consensus ie generate the block template. Saying mining pools are full of individual over simplifies this, do these individuals verfiy the block template?
No, most miners are basically npcs that just point their asic to the pool.
This why there are things like betterhash and p2pool. Trust me mining is massively centralized although many people will claim otherwise because of their ego.
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:51:32

@_date: 2019-07-18 11:41:55
There are plenty of good people in government. Sure bitcoin can be banned and be fought with and we can still keep going. But i believe it's better to be proactive and engage and influence the regulations that occur  proactively to avoid the fight. 
 “Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.”   
― **Sun Tzu,** [**The Art of War**]( 
There were plenty of opportunities like the fair taxation for crypto bill that had bipartisan support that would have introduced a cgt exemption for low value txns for crypto to encourage adoption. 
As our network grows and gets more wealth we must keep track of pro-crypto representatives and fund their election campaigns and provide support. This is not about sucking up to the government, the end goal is for bitcoins to control the government - which will naturally happen when hyper-bitcoinization occurs.

in monero someone apparently made an extension to stratum - eg like betterhash which allows miners to create the block template that they mine towards. 
I suspect a lot of miners don't care - eg short term gain. Also pools might not blatantly shoot themselves in the foot ( if they hold btc )  as it will ruin the reputation of their holdings. But they can covertly abuse the protocol. People might not even notice a 1-2 reorg that censors a txn that people weren't aware off. 
A perfect case study of what happens when a coin is centralized ( by pool admins ) and has weak security is bcash. Pool admins bought BTC hashpower to win a hashwar. By the time people read their emails the hashwar was already over. People still mine at the pools that colluded together to do this.  Not they did not have to do this, because the SV side did not mine empty blocks, which is the only way to 'Soft-Fork' the ABC Hard-Fork, if you know what i mean... 
**Another time**, segwit funds were unlocked and an unknown pool try to claim them - a valid txn. Then two pools colluded together to reorg 2 blocks and double spend the txn forwarding the funds to the intended address ( temporarily supporting segwit in bcash ). This is idiotic, they should have claimed the funds to an address they control and send the funds back to the **original inputs.** regardless the idiots in r/btc celebrated this non-consensus reorg as being a 51% 'defence' 
I used to be a bcasher, but I saw first hand what happens when you sacrifice decentralization for 'utility'. bcash is completely centralized now, they even removed POW consensus - effectively by having a consensus rule that finalizes the block when its depth is 11 *( this is a subjective rule )* and it means non-consensus splits need to be manually resolved by pushing a checkpoint ( HF ). This is basically devs stepping in to finalize consensus. Isn't this why ripple doesn't need POW because they control 'Validator Nodes' that can force consensus if its breaks?

you would need to make sure there is a fireproof secondary containment compartment as you dont want your whole house catching on fire.
You would also need to use the paper seed version - not the crypto steel one. Personally I prefer to keep the seed somewhere i can observe to make sure nobody gets access to the seed without me knowing. As even if you add passphrase protection - if they discover your seed without you realizing its a matter of time before the crack the passphrase. 
You could add some decoy accounts with no passphrase, or weak passphrase -if the bitcoin in these move its a sign that your seed was compromised

yea its a weird name. 
We need to push the line, crypto is coming - does the US government want china to dominate this market with weechat pay? Then china will be able to monitor every transaction us consumers makes. Weechat pay is moving outside china ( we see this in australia ). Chinese will so make their own crypto they can control to subvert us sanctions.
The US should therefore not block libra as it will be regulated by the US and EU and will act more like an ETF - money back by securities - network effect is important and right now the US has a first mover advantage. However users need to transact without being burdened by CGT reporting requirements so the tax code should be updated so low value txns ( below 1000 dollars - adjusted for inflation every 5 years ) are considered personal use and are exempt from CGT. In the same way travelers don't incur CGT expenses if they travel overseas and use local currency. We need fair, consistent and simple tax laws to encourage compliance
The alternative will be to invest 100's of millions in blockchain analytics, which will catch only some users and will result in costly legal battles. Furthermore this technology could be easily subverted due to the decentralized nature of many crypto currencies..

LN is cheap for small txns. If you are sending large hard to route txns - use on chain txns.
Go and read how the ln charge fees. Routing fees are higher for large txns and they are percentage based unlike on chain txns.
Bluewallet allows you to point to your own node or is a custodian wallet which is better for new users who cant provision a HA LN..
That being said bluewallet  should display the fee used, the wallet is not feature complete there are several ux gaps

The fed, and the rba in australia - have an 'inflation target' which is just one of the metrics they would consider when setting interest rates but its not the only thing. 
Furthermore they don't measure inflation quantitatively - in bitcoin we know what it is. In australia they *estimate it* using the cost of a basket of goods (CPI ect ). This basket of goods does not contain the cost of housing/rent which is where new money is flowing and is inflating first. So inflation measure can be manipulated or just wrong. Inflation is also affected by the velocity of money ( think volume in BTC trading ). If the velocity of money is low as it is for housing it takes a while for this new money to effect the broader economy. 
Finally, these central banks also adjust the interest rates to keep the 'economy going' ect. This is example of **'historical correlation, does not mean causality**'. In australia the banks have deliberately lowered the interest rates to stop a housing market correction. They blame trump sanctions but this is bullshit, the much of the australian economy is so dependent on the housing market. 
**If you accept that most money creation, mostly occurs through the commercial banking system then you should logically see that lower fed rates means its cheaper for these banks to lend credit.** Lower rates encourage people to take out loans and speculate to protect their buying power ( in savings ) this creates new credit what pumps the share market and real estate.  So basically lower rates mean the flood gates of credit creation have been opened = more inflation.

Mining nodes are full nodes... Other mining nodes would have rejected that block by building on top of another block. Non mining nodes can reject the block an need to hope there other miners following it's rules.
Being able to run your node means anyone can solo mine which is good for decentralization. That's the main benefit. With larger blocks there is even more insensitive to join a pool and thus non mining nodes become more useless.

Yes it might be impractical for most of us but there are people with more money than in entire market cap of bitcoin. I am sure they could if they want to perform a 1-3 block reorg.
It is however unlikely and the greater the reorg depth the more unlikely it is but pretending that this is not a possibility is playing to ones ego.

I would rather buy monero from a KYC exchange then exchange it for other coins using a swapping service.  There will be more swapping services in the future - you could also use bisq. Once you have crypto its easy to avoid KYC its at the onramp where its difficult
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:13:40


Yea this is a good point.  It would be pretty draconian though. They could force you to give up your view key....
But TBH, i am more scared of buying xmr or btc on bisq using fiat. I just dont want my account being flagged as 'suspicious'. If you keep sending lots of money  to random accounts.
For the above point, there will be some lead up before government implement some mandatory declaration policy. I would hope that i am savy enough to see it coming and have moved to a more friendly country. 
The only advantage of buy xmr from an exchange is that when you sell it for fiat you can explain where you got it from. But you can also lie and say you mined this - there is no way to verify this as well. I agree buying xmr or btc form bisq is ideal. But for some volumes is not practical 
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:48:52
understand the technical details on how bitcoin are stored in unsigned outputs. When you make a transaction two outputs are generated. One is a payment and one goes back to an address you control. 
So umm it happens often. There are plenty of people who have consolidated their bitcoin or have got 50 btc addresses. 
Its actually very difficult to have a good estimate of the activity. You could get a good estimate using stats gathered from all the payment processors. I doubt the people who put those charts did that. So their estimate is so far off its not worth considering. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:28:39
yea non of which allow you to deposit 10K, this is only safe and possible with a kyc exchange sadly.

@_date: 2015-12-27 22:10:28
Its actually worse. It requires the merchant to decided on accepting the transaction based on the fee. What If the merchant rejects the transaction if the fee is too low and the transaction makes it in before an hour has passed.  For this to work the merchant needs to have the ability to cancel the transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:02:47
Or maybe it would be centralized in a country that would be unlikely to ban bitcoin mining!

Buy monero using fiat, convert to btc then pretend you never spent your monero. You obviously need to use a decentralized exchange when converting xmr to btc. Pretend you never spent your monero. Profit?
Its easier to acquire xmr if there is an exchange that accepts fiat for it.

From their perspective bitcoin cash meets their vision of 'bitcoin' and this is why the re-branding effort was done. I doubt it will be ever attempted again unless bitcoin is completely unused in future in which case it wont matter.
Therefore I dont think it was malicious.


This is due to the perception that BCH was trying to claim the BTC name, whoes name is worth something. While this is true now, due to fact that price discovery is based mostly on speculation, in the future ( hopefully) it will be based on utility.
Hyper cryptoization and the end of the monopoly of fiat is something that will increase the utility of everyone's crypto and should be the goal of everyone. This why i hope to two camps will realize they are better of working on adoption together ( even though the technical method of achieving it different ).

@_date: 2018-08-14 10:10:41
You cannot change the supply limit without a hardfork, if they are the only miners then all the miners would leave the BCH chain and create a new one. I doubt they could steal the BCH name.
If they leave the difficulty would quickly adjust and there would be a new set of miners supporting the old chain.

Fiat is easy to spend, because obviously its been around longer... But so were horses. When the first cars came out do you think they were easy to use? 
Finally, something isn't good because it's easy to use. Fiat is bad money, because the total supply is in unknown and barely controlled. It's simply a poor form of money which we all use because there was no alternative.
When I first heard of bitcoin - decentralized peer to peer money, I did not care. But then I started to learn how Fiat money actually works and was disgusted with what I saw. This made invest heavily in bitcoin. 
Once you understand Fiat money, so many problems in the world like housing bubbles, wealth inequality and geopolitics start to seem connected and makes sense. It's sort of like all laws of physics like the benouli equations can also be explained through conservation of energy. 
Money is like energy, its somewhat invoked In every interaction we make... You need to understand it..

Actually this is not a bad idea. In some countries the top income tax bracket is above 50%, in this case you actualy gain money by donating in bitcoin. Say your salary is 1000k an this hits the top tax bracket of 70% if you sold 100k worth of bitcoin which you bought at 1c you would get 30% of its value back. Where as if you donated them to charity you would get 70% of it value back by a tax deduction.

Its also an bitcoin exchange. It is necessary for adoption of bitcoin, do you seriously expect people to buy bitcoin from local bitcoin only. There's nothing wrong when centralization as long as decentralized elements can compete, which they can. I think you are just complaining because they support classic.
Honestly I don't see the problem with larger block sizes if it becomes a problem reduce the limit again.
Speaking of centralization there like only two trust worthy-ish bitcoin asic sellers. What if one day they decided to only cater for large farm operates ( in China)... Or if they do sell to individuals the asics are inflated so there is no roi even if you have free power?
There are so many problems that need to be met, but we have been stuck arguing about the blocksize with a toxic and divide community.

You are correct if a single person owned all the nodes and all of the miners they can arbitrarily changed the protocol. But them thing your are forgetting even in that extreme case...that coin at a moments notice can suddenly become decentralized, via a hard fork and proof of work change + a strong united community.
**Fiat cash and even reserve bank currency is base money because there is a controlled supply, even though its centralized**. It is literally called base money in economics. Whats in your bank account is an IOU because technically they are holding an asset on your behalf. Current monetary system is bad because the IOUs allow the banks to operate on ridiculous fractional reserves. 
IOU = someone is holding your asset for you... centralization does't mean an asset is an IOU otherwise cash is also an IOU it is not...

@_date: 2016-03-03 09:24:07
I agree bitcoin will not meet visas transaction volume. 
But my question to core developers is ... do we need to? 
In Agile software development we don't try and future proof our implementation. I feel the need to match VISA's transaction volume is case of _Future Proofing_ bitcoins performance requirements.
Instead we should look at bitcoins rate of adoption. Eventually it will probably _slow down_ because of the poor UX. ( I am not talking about transaction delays ) It is difficult to use bitcoin securely and for a lot of regular people  and it is scary. 
I find it hard to believe in the next 2-5 years the demand on the bitcoin network will be even close to visas. 
Finally I think off-chain solutions are a great idea! However if bitcoin is like tcp/ip ( the base protocol layer) then offchain systems are all the layers above it, http, web browsers and everything else that makes the internet great. 
But imagine if the institution that is developing the responsible for the tcp/ip standard started making web browsers while developing the base protocol at the same time, it would be ridiculous!  This is certainly not Agile either! Finally there would be serious conflict of interests during development. That is what I feel is happening with the bitcoin core project.
Bitcoin core developers should only focus on:  _on-chain solutions_ to improve the capacity of the bitcoin protocol to meet current and _realistic_ demands. They should totally ignore the requirements and demand for lightening network as this would be a conflict of interest. I think a lot people feel core developers have given up on on-chain transaction capability and want to keep it as, and focus on the lightening network. Unfortunately due to censorship other people think cores behavior is a conspiracy 
Instead Bitcoin core developers should try and make on-chain transactions as fast as possible. 
While another team can work on solutions for off-chain transactions! ( Best of both worlds ) 
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:28:22
You are free to fork bitcoin. If you get support from an exchanges the market will make one version more valuable.
No one can stop this bitcoin, all decentralized applications have this ability to fork. If it cannot then it's centralized.
Of course you need sufficient support because there are plenty of poor code is law zealots that will get offended by the fork. Providing you have enough hashpower and quality high-end nodes your fork will survive such attacks 
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:29:20

@_date: 2017-03-26 09:49:05
you can always go down in block size via a softfork right. 
Some kind of dynamic block size based on fees would be better I think. The average block size can be low but it can get larger when there are peaks in demand. This way fees can be a bit more predictable and people dont have to over estimate the fees required which is happening now. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:43:05

@_date: 2016-03-03 19:37:48

a bitcoin transaction is never an IOU even when its pending. Maybe bitcoin balances on exchanges are an IOU. 
look, *please* watch the beginning of this video - pay attention to the part on the evolution of money...
When you understand this you will truly understand why the concept of bitcoin is valuable even with a little bit of centralization.
You are correct, centralization creates the possibility of censorship where miners can censor certain transactions. But this has never happened yet so its not a problem. **But the great thing about bitcoin, is that its designed in away that allows it to suddenly become more decentralized via a hardfork, POW change ect.** 
The true value of bitcoin is for the first time we have digital base money that people can hold! I value this above all else.

It's not a chicken or the egg problem. Each network of compatible full nodes will have group of miners supporting then.  The insentive model implemented by the nodes assures this.
Hash power is about security. Nodes pick the hardest to mine chain to agree on a single date of utxo for bitcoin and implictly pick the chain which is the most difficult to mine for security.
Why can't people in r/btc understand this, it's like bitcoin 101. If people can't understand this they shouldn't run nodes or be apart of the scaling debate...

Higher fees mean more of you're bitcoin is unspendable. Say fees were 10 dollars and your bitcoin was spread across multiple inputs cointaining 1 dollar each, then guess what you have effectively 0 bitcoin. 
Unless you can use some transactions accelerator to combine your outputs.

I used to support BCH, but then after the split I saw it for what it was. It's a centralized coin controlled by an unprofessional development team.
Most of the subreddit is very religious - 'us - vs them' mentality and a lot of tribalism that focuses decisions based on actions of thought leaders ( CSW vs Ver ) as opposed to technical differences between coins. I am not saying it doesn't occur here either...
I believed larger blocks because I wanted BTC to be accessible to people in poorer countries as their wallets would typically have many small outputs - and a lot of their savings would get eaten by fees.  But mining centralization is worse than effect of larger blocks - we saw this during the HF when pools deliberately made large blocks and people complained.
The icing on the cake is this:
BitcoinABC did a change to the consensus rules ( HF potential ) in a fucken hotfix.  They implemented reorg protection so nodes will not follow the longest chain. They attempt to dictate consensus at a protocol level and thus they introduced weak subjectivity into the consensus layer. This change defeats the WHOLE PURPOSE OF POW - which is to remove the subjectivity of time - completely.
many boast about reading the whitepaper could not understand how it violated bitcoins original design most are not capable of thinking laterally they can only parrot direct quotes from the white paper like a fucken npc. There coin is a total disgrace to the what bitcoin represents - they signal handedly destroyed the big block vision.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:52:24




It is an alt-coin, but rather than one mined from scratch its forked of the current blockchain.
agree with BUs approach, in fact I would be less conservative and remove the blocksize entirely and replace it with a minimum fee distribution function.
Which makes it exponentially expensive to create large blocks. Large blocks that have withheld miner created transactions would he orphaned, due to an enhanced relay mechanism which requires any transaction included in a block to be broadcast to the whole network.
I think this could temporarily allow large blocks to as long as users pay for their transaction to be included in the block. This will result in more predictable fees as there wont be a race condition to get into a 1MB block 
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:34:07

"if onchain fees can’t support the security of the network, the 21m cap will likely be lifted with consensus in the future. But this debate really isn’t that important until two more block reward halvenings occur from my perspective"
From Twitter.
I thought the LN was meant when users want privacy, POS payments  and for small payments.
Eg buying from a vending machine. It's not going to replace all onchain activity.
I thought the LN is like a spending layer and regular btc wallet is your savings. I still transfer money from these accounts often in my fiat bank...
My main point is would you accept this or is it a violation of the social contract? It definitely would be a contentious hard fork. I believe if it was easy to do then bitcoin would be fairly centralized and it fails for this reason alone.

I was pointing out that it's electricty prices they have the biggest effect on miner centralization.
Maybe we can create a minimum fee function instead + adaptive blocksize to stop miners artificially creating large blocks. So simply set a limit to 2 - 4 mb
The question is can we increase the block size to 2-4 MB and organically grow bitcoin. 
People can still run bitcoin nodes on raspberry pi if they run it as a leaf node..
2 - 4 MB every ten minutes is not that much right?

there is a very slight risk. You see they have to stop mining on the chain they think that will survive. Also miners run on very thin margins. Its the competitiveness of mining that makes miners fairly conservative. They are more likely to mine where it is profitable

@_date: 2019-03-21 19:19:12
Its something we need to keep in mind if the block size remains small. If fees increase to say 30 cents per output you use, then if your life savings are spread out over multiple outputs worth 1 dollar then 30 percent of your btc will be lost to fees.
So as fees increase people might have to consolidate outputs, but hopefully something else might fix this.
Not sure if schnorrs helps with this...

I would say proof of stake voting. 
Eg 15% of all bitcoin support hard fork 10% doesn't the rest didn't vote. 
Then once the fork occurs you can continue POW which is proven. You could even keep the same POW function because as soon as miners realize the overwhelming majority of holders support one chain, they will mine to secure that chain.

@_date: 2017-03-26 20:22:39
Except bitcoins value is that it can be spent without middle men. Something that cannot be spent for day to day things eventually needs to be exchanged for something that can be spent for purchases.
It is at these gateways where it is vunerable to censorship.
See how stolen etc was seized by all the exchanges. Nobody accepts etc directly and if you can't convert it it's worthless.
Therefore digital gold bitcoin is actually quite centralized and easy to cease....
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:39:47
You realize, what you are discribing is a hard fork. If you can stand BU, that much you are welcome to fork off. 
Imo, this is a sign of decentralization. What defines bitcoin is through the consunsus of the community. Miners only rule is to order transactions within that. 
If you fundamentally disagree with the protocol create a new network inside which you have consensus.
If this happens there will be political consequences. Companies such as exchanges, bitpay and wallet providers will have a strong day in which chain will be more  valuable.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:40:37
But the lightning network doesn't exist yet. So why can't core just raise the blocksize limit to reduce current demand.

@_date: 2017-03-26 22:19:12
I agree, the reason for 1mb is not for decentralization of miners. It's so there is more political motivation for second layer solutions.
Can someone one explain why larger blocks cause centralization? 
Imo if you are running nodes you can still be a leaf node and download 1mb every 10 minutes. 
People have also said larger blocks will result in miner centralization, but it's already centralized with 1mb blocks.

roger ver is naive - very very naive.  I think he is not malicious like CSW, though he is a whole another level.
fun fact: bch implemented reorg protection
effect: weak subjectivity in a coin that has 'POW' ( but basically doesn't use it for anything other than wasting electricity )
THE WHOLE POINT OF POW was to remove the subjectivity of time - so a decentralized network can behave objectively.
Now all the media saying POW is a waste of electricity; in bcash it basically is.  This is the thing in bcash that is fundamentally different from bitcoin.
Bitcoin uses POW fully, bitcoin is secured by insentives, bitcoin is decentralized.
Bcash does not use pow for consensus, bcash is secured by a centralized dev team that will release a checkpoint patch if the system goes out of consensus, bcash is centralized.

greater capacity, to meet current demand. It will allow continued organic growth in adoption.
Raising the blocksize limit to 2mb will not suddenly mean all blocks are 2mb. It will take some time for these blocks to get consistently full.
Node count is not the only factor in bitcoin 'decentralization' 
you also realize as the block reward gets smaller, the reward from fees must proportionally increases. There is an upper limit in what people are willing to pay in fees, so they only way to increase the total fees is to increase the total level of adoption.
There are tone of reasons to increase the block-size, not many reasons to decrease it.

Bitcoins protocol rules are subjective - ie you can send money from A to B if address A has enough. Its subjective because of time, it's not possible to have a perfectly synchronized time across a decentralized network.  Some nodes might see that A has already been spent while others might not. 
In the original bitcoin, all subjectivity was removed by implementing a 'decentralized time  server' using proof of work


Section 4, bitcoin whitepaper
In the original bitcoin protocol rules were only concerned about, how people use bitcoin, the inflation schedule and the rate at which blocks are produced. Not a single protocol rule attempted to govern how blocks are ordered( ie deciding time ).  This was the sole responsibility of the POW consensus layer.
When amury implemented reorg protection this changed. This is an architectural smell that no POW coin can have. It means bch protocol is weakly subjective.  [ 
This is a security compromise that POS coins accept, but there is not reason for a POW coin to do this.

when a hard fork activates, those that dont have the updated code will reject blocks being posted to the blockchain. 
Therefore they no longer keep track of the longest chain. This why devs prefer softforks because old nodes will still consider new blocks as valid and they will converge to the longest chain even while being out of date.

If it was in the UK I would be skeptical but yes now i understand...
"An officer who was shot with a crossbow during the encounter had minor injuries."
It looks like they were after him for possession of weapons. If the article is true in a police officer for hit by a now I guess they shoot him for that. 
Tbh, cross bows cannot be reloaded instantly, so technically he would be unharmed after firing the weapon....
Also this is the London police, they don't carry guns. They would need special permission to carry out a raid with a gun. They will need to investigate this none the less. But it looks like they are two sides to this story....

before you attempt a POW change, you would need the support of wallet providers and payment providers like bitpay. It would also be worthwhile conducting a vote based on how much bitcoin you own to see how much capital would be dumped if the fork went through. 
you would need to make the new chain immune to replay attacks because the main bitcoin chain would continue to exist. It would be similar to ETC vs ETH.

No fiat currency is not real money anymore. You can transfer iou using visa but you can't make payment's in money. 
In the end bitcoin must become a strong currency and become a competitor to the iou money, this end goal is more important than network decentralization.

My point is these optimizations don't exist now and raising the block size slightly will allow greater adoption right now.

The lower the adoption the easier it is to ban bitcoin. By leaving the block size at 1mb you are limiting the usage of bitcoin to a constant amount of people. Also eventually the block reward will go tho zero so volume needs to be increased if you want to have resonable fees. 
People need to stop making unsubstantiated speculation that increasing the block size slightly will suddenly make bitcoin centralized.

You realize you can't hold for ever, unless you plan on not spending your savings. What's the point of saving money if you can't spend it.
Also it's important exchanges have real volume and deep order books, if not that value you say bitcoin has is not real! 
Merchant adoption and a market around bitcoin creates a base Demand for buying and selling bitcoin. This is vital to ensure bitcoin actually has value relative to fiat in the short term.
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:20:51
Imo, the best defense is to have bitcoin users in positions of power.

It's something that can happen to anyone, hope it works out.
@_date: 2016-06-05 09:16:39
hey becareful with virtual machines. You are better off using a trezor (hardware wallet). The reason is if you post a transaction from the same public key with a repeated nonce you can expose your private key. This can happen as a result of bad number generators or as a result of vm snapshots! Look at this: 
"Why did this work? ECDSA requires a random number for each signature. If this random number is ever used twice with the same private key it can be recovered. This transaction was generated by a hardware bitcoin wallet using a pseudo-random number generator that was returning the same “random” number every time."
Some wallets dont use a random generator to get a nonce, they are deterministic however your _VM_ snapshots might mess with this. 
I wish more people were aware of this, to me it is a serious UX issue, I wish there was a way to prevent this happening at the protocol level. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:34:53

The whole point of Bitcoin is to become a valid alternate money to fiat. As long a fictional reserve asset is widely accepted everything will be measured relative to it.
And banksters can create artificially property bubbles every 8 years that only result in more and more people being in debt to them.
While value is measured using fiat, Bitcoin will only every be a speculative asset.

@_date: 2017-01-12 08:09:01
yea your right, given network decentralization economic centralization can happen latter. For the first is definitely more important. 
However what I am worried, economic de-centralization is not improving and may go backward.
The end goal of economic centralization is that some merchants and employees want to hold a certain amount of bitcoin. Therefore exchanges and systems such as bitpay are less important.
I noticed when people discuss government attacks on bitcoin, they immediately think they would confiscate hash-power and try 51% attacks or attempt to ddos nodes. However, going after exchanges and payment providers is much easier and will have a larger impact on the long term success of bitcoin.
Finally in the long term, ( when the block reward goes away ) the consensus system must be secure purely on the incentive of transaction fee's. This is if we intend to not have continuous inflation like other currencies. 
I want to avoid this because someone will have to decide how much inflation is enough for security, if you think the block-size debate is bad imagine what will happens to the community when developers decide on the inflation rate.

sending btc to a lite coin address would mean it would be sent to the equivalent address on the bitcoin blockchain.
How do you recover the bitcoin if you dont know that private key?
Does this work because your lite coin private key was generated using the same global private used for your bitcoin, allowing you to figure out the private key for the address you sent your bitcoin to?

Hardforks at 95% are not dangerous, because the old nodes will be booted off the network and will not revive any blocks because the difficulty is too high. 
It should be obvious to any person who hasn't upgraded.
This is why there's no difference between a hardfork and softfork, in fact I would prefer a hardfork, because now all the nodes on the network are updated.

I define economic decentralization as merchants wanting to accept and hold bitcoin without going through payment processors.
eg. imagine if every merchant payment when through bitpay, who accept bitcoin and convert it to fiat before depositing it into the shops bank account.  This is an example of economic centralization. Because if bitpay is taken down bitcoin loses a huge amount of its utility and thus value. ( if you cant buy anything with it what value does it have ? )
While this is occurring bitcoin might plenty of nodes, however this does not stop the government targeting a very limited set of exchanges and payment providers...

They use payment protocols to force people to use the right fee, i think this is ok unless your willing to wait for confirmations. But this wouldn't work for most online shops that use bitpay.
Payments protocols was introduced by Bitcoin core so more wallet should support it.
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:54:46
The design of the protocol (ux) affected how business operates.
For example it's more expensive for merchants to accept bitcoin because those wallets would contain bitcoin spread across many outputs. One person was paying fees in the order of a few dollars each time they withdraw from their business account.
This encourages merchants to use middle men like bitpay.

Maybe next time you buy a steam game you should use bitcoin, I always do. It would be sad if they stop because not enough people use that service. Bitcoins, value has increased as more merchants have adopted it and financial services have built around it.

They plan on having a 4% inflation rate as well in order to keep the same security level we have now.
Because we need to supplement the fees we get from settlement transactions, as there won't be many.
Decentralization, is the biggest innovation of bitcoin. 
It's more important than invention of truly digital money, that saved us from endless credit printing and the volatility in the markets it creates.
We must keep the blocksize as small as possible, so we can run nodes in TOR. Because when government wants to ban bitcoin they will attack the bitcoin nodes!! And do double spends!! instead of targeting centralized services like bitpay, which most merchants use...
Also main stream adoption is not important, bitcoin does not need to achieve a critical mass to succeed. The fewer people use it the less likely it will be banned! It's not like politicians listen to the vast majority of people anyway....

I see, but couldn't this happen with a soft-fork, where the rules are tightened. For example if the first block is not valid (weaker rules) for upgraded nodes. The blockchain would be forked where newer nodes build on the chain without the rejected block, while the old nodes accept that block and continue.
Also there is a natural safe guard in bitcoin against accidental forks. This is the difficulty adjustment. If a small section of the network forks away without much hash-power it will take a very long time to mine blocks without a manual difficulty adjustment ( which is another intentional hard fork!)
I still dont see why hard-forks are more dangerous than soft forks aren't all unintentional forks equally dangerous?

Yes gold has Intrinsic value, it's a decent conductor which doesn't rust.
Bitcoins Intrinsic value is that it can be transacted. However if it lacks utility for spending then less people would want it, there would be less exchanges as demand decreases. Which reduce its utility to bypass capital controls.
Basically the higher adoption of bitcoin, the less we rely on exchanges because more people can hold it and use it for day to day things.
If fork of bitcoin does what bitcoin does except it's cheaper and has better utility guess what people will use...

Mining centralization is due to cheaper electricity prices. The main concern is the cost of operating full-nodes, which is not substantially increased based on current calculations.
Right now users are complaining about fee's being too high eg 10 cents per transaction. If you are saying we wait until fees are 30 cents per transaction before we increase the block-size, this will probably never happen because people will simply stop using bitcoin.  
People think this fine, because bitcoin is a store of wealth. But if you have to convert bitcoin into fiat in order to spend it, because merchants no longer accept it, then bitcoin loses its intrinsic value. It also becomes more vulnerable to censorship at the transition points between fiat and bitcoin. Currently services that allow merchants to accept bitcoin like Bitpay are centralized and are easily targeted by governments. 
If bitcoin is going to survive merchants need to accept and hold bitcoin, and this is only possible if people can use it for the majority of their purchases. Right now this isn't possible but we need to help bitcoin achieve its critical mass while we still can. Everyday we slow adoption of bitcoin, is another day governments have to catch up.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:06:43
The only reason bitcoin has value is because merchants accept bitcoin. 
If all merchants stop accepting bitcoin and I have to convert bitcoin to fiat, through an exchange or some kind of centralized intermediatory, it has lost all of its value imo.
In which case I wouldnt care if it was decentralized and tones of people are running nodes. Because it's value would be goat shit, the same as Venezuelan fiat....
Satoshi wasn't trying to create decentralized currency. His goal was to end the debt based fractional reserve credit system we have.
People we have a fractional reserve system, with mega banks that operate with ZERO% satututary reserve requirements ( Australia ).
We need a bitcoin economy, merchants need to accept bitcoin and pay their staff in bitcoin... Because they want to hold bitcoin to use for day to day goods and services.
When we have to use bitpay ( centralized element ) to migrate issues like the OP described, we are trading more protocol decentralization for increased economic centralization? 
I don't know if core devs understand this, because their focus on the protocol...

Yes you just described what gives gold its intrinsic value. If people did not use it for jewelry and industrial purposes why would they use it as a store of value? There are plenty of rare metals in this world which are not used as a store of value. In order for something to be a store of value it needs to be valuable to begin with.
You also described additional uses cases of bitcoin, all of the use case you describe involve liquidity of bitcoin. 
The point I wanted people to consider was hypothetical...
That is, if no single merchant accepted bitcoin and you couldn't buy anything with it - even on the internet. Would bitcoin be valuable then then? 
This is my take: 
I would also assume in this case only exchanges and local bitcoin would accept it, bitcoins 'value' would only be as a speculative asset. Seeing as you have to sell your bitcoin in order to use it you are essentially gambling you would be able to do so before everyone else. Any asset that gets its value through only speculation is inherently unstable decentralized or not. 
The only reason I invest it in bitcoin right now, is because I see it scaling to becoming a main currency in the next 20 years. If I knew it will become a purely speculative store of value with no industrial usage I would dumb all my bitcoin now.

Allowing any inflation, would go against the founding principles of bitcoin. I understand some people would support it, but many would not and the change would fork the network. 
The problem is, people who don't want inflation in bitcoin need to push for greater adoption now in order to achieve critical mass in the future. This is my position and it is why I support bigger blocks, even if it increases the cost of operating a node.
Inflation is more controversial than increasing the block-size. I find it ironic, that alternative solutions to segwit and discussion contentious solution is banned, but suggesting inflation for bitcoin is ok.
I am against censorship, and you obviously have the right to say what you want, but other should also.

My point is a person's net worth cannot be fairly evaluated. If I create a shit coin that has a trillion units and i sell one of coin to my friend for one dollar my net worth is trillion dollars.
In a bull market people's net worth might be inflated and the stock market can crash and you still owe taxes even if all you did is held. 
This is totally unfair, if satoshi was a us citizen he would be forced to liquidate bitcoin every year to pay taxes despite doing nothing.

Yes but miners ( pool admins ) run full nodes. Therefore they also validate the supply of BTC.

Pooled mining as it is right now is very centralized because miners defer consensus work

Miners dont control the protocol but they can do a lot of damage if they leave, this is why things like betterhash prevent dev's just talking only to mining pool admins which happens in bcash to make sure their HF's go smoothly, realistically all the bcash users could never stop a HF from happening - without the support of at least one pool ( initially )

Ok i see, with a soft-fork the old nodes will always re-org to the longest valid chain eventually even if one miner intentionally creates a block under the old rules, the fork created by this will eventually be orphaned providing the majority of the miners are using upgraded clients. 
Basically soft-forks are safer as they require less action on the user, although you could still get screwed if the soft-fork activates with a low hash power threshold. 
For a hardfork, people using online wallets like mytrezor would generally be safe but when they are using full-node wallets they could desync from the network. It would be good if clients had a warning that detects when a block has not be updated in an unusually long time.
Now that I understand this, i see why soft-forks are considered safer. However I feel hard-forks are still OK. If wallet clients can implement better warning &amp; with the difficulty guard most people should be safe.
Its not something that needs to be avoided explicitly

also miners are incentives not to not publish invalid blocks. They can also introduced new rules ( soft-forks ) without the permission of non-mining nodes. eg soft-blacklisting certain addresses ( refusing to confirm txns ) ect. Intentionally creating congestion. 
Decentralization in mining nodes ( real full nudes ) are more important than non-mining nodes. There is a perception that mining fullnodes and non mining nodes are equally important - they aren't for the points i just illustrated.

@_date: 2019-10-01 12:12:07


i am just stating a fact, and you seem to have been triggered into thinking somehow that i am saying banks control bitcoin. 
But this is probably what the OP post was trying to imply that many other crypto projects are controlled by banks. This chart could have just as easily have blockstream and a line to the bitcoin open source project. 
Some of the projects like ripple are centralized by their nature. Having developers funded by banks doesn't mean that project is owned/controlled by them. 
At the same time it's ridiculous to say the influence of blockstream on the direction of the bitcoin protocol is the same as same random user running a bitcoin node.  
i am sure a talented developer can convince other developers who control the bitcoin repository to merge a pull request for a BIP.  But convincing people takes time/skill &amp; political effort. Having a large well funded company that can promote your ideas through media make it easier for the developers working under that company. 
Centralization and manipulation of developers is something no cypto has fully solved. The best defense is to have strong mining decentralization so any attempted to change the protocol maliciously can be blocked via softf-fork (re-orgs). But non mining nodes cant do this effectively or they will be forked of into a network with very few miners and a high difficulty

What do you mean by 'insecure' an old nodes.
 I thought hard forks loosen the requirements so a block accepted by old nodes would be accepted by the upgraded nodes, but not necessarily the reverse. 
For a old pre-soft fork nodes, blocks accepted by them might be accepted by the upgraded nodes which have more restrictive rules. 
In either scenario the network can be forked, are you saying one is more likely than the other? 
Also in a fork, I thought forks only activate after a long period of time giving important nodes to upgrade. If there are junk nodes that are barely maintained running on AWS instances, having these booted out of the network is not a bad thing right?

if your onboarding more users I doubt we will get to a point where we can reduce the blocksize limit. We should keep it at a size where bandwidth is sufficient to propagate it effectively.
If you make the block size 1kb it will propagate across the network at same rate as a 30kb block - this is because the time to process both blocks is negligible and the biggest factor slowing down block propagation is geographic separation ie the  speed of light.
Considering that Ping goes to a destination and then back again, the packet sent by Ping would travel 40,000 km, the equivalent of a trip around Earth.
That is **133 milliseconds**.
If a 1 MB block takes roughly the same time to propagate as a 300 KB block across mining nodes then there is no gain in reducing the block size limit.  So far i have seen zero evidence.
I would rather increase the confirmation time eg 10-20 mins instead of decreasing blocksize. Bigger block limit with longer confirmation times is preferable imo. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:16:57


the block size reward drops exponentially - which means 2140 effect will start happening sooner than people think. Especially if the bitcoin price does not grow exponentially - which i suspect will stop soon enough.

If people borrow money to buy btc its almost equivalent to tether printing money to buy btc.

have you heard of diminishing returns? What type of centralization do you mean - mining? 
Other factors contribute to mining centralization - like electricity costs. Miners have been ok with 1mb blocks for ages.
reducing blocks will increase median fees which increase the % of your savings that will be unspendable due to fees to include that output. The more address your savings are spread out across the more of your savings you lose. This effects people in poorer countries most who buy their btc in 10-20 USD dollar amounts or similarly merchants that directly accept bitcoin. 
There is little reason to reduce the blocksize and luke is out of touch with the economic aspects of bitcoin

If you buy xmr first your identity is associated with it's outputs then shift it to btc then the exchange,irs,us gov cannot ever track your btc. Obviously you do multiple shifts and keep your utxo unconsolidated. ( Not using shapeshift obviously )
When you want to sell to fiat you can shift back to xmr then sell to fiat.

At this stage we may as well implement full RBF, if transactions are randomly droped out of the mempool. I think FULL RBF is a good idea we dont need merchants using zero-conf hacks so they can buy cofee, clearly bitcoin is not designed for realtime payments

Thing is if fee go up for BTC, on chain txns will become impractical for small txns. So the only option is to use LN network to accept BTC.
Is there an easy way of accepting LN without having to run your own BTC.  If new merchants are forced to run BTC nodes to accept LN forget it.

@_date: 2017-11-13 10:50:18
There is no problem with opt-in rbf. Its just most wallets currently dont implement it. Trezor refuse to, so your transaction could get stuck in the mempool for ever.  ( Unless you pay ALOT for those transaction accelerator services - which throws away your privacy usually) 
The only advantage of Full RBF over OPT-IN RBF. Is that it will discourage merchants to trust zero-conf completely. They have two choices
* 1) Dont accept zero-conf
* 2) Accept zero conf ( insecure ) but have delayed verification ( eg cancel subscription ) 
* 3) A cheaper and more private transaction accelerator ( any RBF accepting pool  ) 
RBF, is not a consensus rule, its a mempool and relay policy. Therefore it is possible for another client to simply implement and relay these transactions. Eventually some miners might accept full RBF as it will give them a profitability advantage over other miners that don't. However this is unlikely as it requires coordination from users and miners ( mining and node non-mining nodes). **As the block reward is reduced and fee's take a larger proportion of the reward, this intensive will be greater.**
Therefore, I do see RBF being implemented by miners in the future at some point. Initially zero-conf was a cool idea it was a hack that allowed instant payments without building second layers. But now we have prototypes for the LN working and high fee's. The benefits of supporting zero-conf are outweighed by their negatives...
* stuck transactions
* encouraging poor merchant practices ( accept zero-conf and forgetting to check them ) 
* making it harder for clients to predict fee's ( some clients dont use RBF ) 
For a while, bitcoin has been unusable for over the counter small value purchases ( where zero-conf is important) therefore I no longer see the value supporting it. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:06:33
They need to consolidate outputs, merchants that accept btc directly would need to do this. Merchants need to use the LN network to avoid having wallets with to many small outputs.
Eventually zeroconf will be broken because some miner will implement transaction replacement then zeroconf will be permanently broken. This is why we need the LN for small instant payments.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:54:56
Rbf is not actually apart of the bitcoin protocol. Which defines what's valid in blocks. People need safe instant confirmation, that's only possible in the LN. If someone creates a full rbf patch for bch nodes and an independent relay system and as soon as one mining pool implements full rbf there's a finite probability of the first seen rule will be violated.
The first seen rule is not protected by Bitcoins insensitive system therefore it's naive to expect it will hold indefinitely. Therefore building a hold industry on the good will of all miners is dangerous it's something that most bcashers can't comprehend.

The volume of tether is comparable to the 24 hr volume of btc according to blockfolio...

I am a bit worried tether market cap increased by a billion and its volume is similar to BTC. Most of the trading pairs that have high volume are BTC/USDT pairs.
If USDT was about to collapse people would want to buy other coins at any price so it would see crypto prices grow temporarily as some USDT holders panic
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:08:02

Bsv is just a bcash fork it's not there same as bitconnect. The network might be heavily centralized but it's still not as centralized as onecoin or bitconnect which were designed as scams.
If anything bsv is a better version of bcash it has larger block limit and they did not implemented reorg protection which is basically proof stake in disguise. If reorg protection is safe and don't cause centralization why didn't satoshi think of it.
Think about how ripple achieves consensus without mining it's literally reorg protection set to reject any reorg. If the system goes out of consensus some validation centralized nodes take over. Except in bcash it's going to be the dev team. Bcash is designed to be as centralized as ripple despite having a bigger network than bsv.

For trezor model 1 you need to enter your passphrase into the host. Even for the model t some passphrases need to be entered into the host. So you may as well store it electronically - securely.
It really only protects against physical access to your seed.
Oh i guess there also some exploits that require physical access to a trezor too...
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:17:09
there is already the discussion that there will be so few on chain transactions ( smaller blocks an all ) since all transactions will be moved to the second layer. When the block reward halves a few more times it will be insufficient to secure the chain therefore a tail emission like monero will be required eg 1-2% inflation each year to supplemented limited fees from people opening and close LN channels or other second layer solutions. 
This is why on-chain transactions need to take place eg where people can wait for confirmations ( eg buying trezor or item that can get shipped after confirmations ). Where you want instant safe micro payments you can use the LN. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:29:20

BCH isn't a copy any more. By implementing re-org protection - any regorg greater than k is invalid, it is bypassing POW. Its essentially using POS in disguise - there there is only one party involved dictating consensus ( the developers ). This is basically the same as ripple. If ripple falls out of consensus ripple lab validator nodes will dicated consensus.   
BSV is closer to Bitcoin than BCH

Aiscboost is still possible with Bitcoin, just don't fill your blocks with segwit transactions. You can only kill asic boost fully with a hardfork

The best way to force bitpays hand is to break the first seen rule in both btc and bch.
Why? because the fsr is not protected by Bitcoins insensitive system. Once a single pool starts ingnoring the fsr is dead.
Building a Industry on the good will of everyone is idoitic and only works if there is centralization. The fact that this has not happened means there is already to much mining centralization.

well Tether is already fractionally backed seeing as some off its reserves were stolen.


 They can continue to do this until people who hold bitcoin are not stupid enough to sell their BTC into something that is unbacked...
Blockfolio, coinmarketcap all have slightly different estimations of volumes, i guess because they dont monitor everyone and have different outlier filters. The link below shows some money flow charts.  But their BTC volume estimate was lower than that shown in coinmarketcap &amp; blockfollio. 
 [ 
sort the main page by volume and you see its BTC than USDT... that is quite worrying. 
**Bitfinex reserves**
 [ 
 [ 
*These aren't 1st hand sources so please verify* if you dont believe.. but I dont have the time to dig them up. 
To summarize, tether is very bad for crypto in general. I think Libra coins could never do what people believe Bitfinex/Tether are up too. The companies investing in Libra have reputations to preserve, while they might mine your data to serve ads and censor politically incorrect activity they would never commit outright fraud by printing money without reserves. If they operate on a fractional reserve it would be transparent.  While people complained about facebook coins, i truly hope something becomes the king stable coin.

@_date: 2017-11-12 19:38:12
It means it's harder to run nodes. Maybe we need smaller blocks? 300kB as luke suggested is a good idea
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:26:31
it does but there are other factors that result in centralization. Network cost is only 1 of the issues and if its negligible relative to other issues it doesn't matter. 
Obviously 128mb blocks that take 10 minutes to propagate will benefit larger pools significantly.  If a small pool eg 1% of the hashpower has the same profitability as a large pool ( same electricity cost ) you have the right levels of decentralization.
Bitcoin also becomes more decentralized as more users join the network - more potential miners, devs and merchants. Making blocks smaller needs to have quantitative facts to back it up. Luke saying smaller blocks will decentralize bitcoin more is not a strong enough arugment. We need to see facts like block propagating time ect before the community will support the idea.

@_date: 2017-04-03 18:00:22
Well, there is a way, the most they can do is try and do is orphan transactions. But in doing so they have to waste 33.5% of their harsh power. But how much will this cost? Millions of dollars a day? 
Miners run on thin margins they cannot afford to waste electricity on a chain they think is worthless or that their trying to undermine.
So you could literally wait and the coin would recover. Many miners would be after profits therefore they will switch to which chain most people support.
So it's really the competitiveness in mining that protects bitcoin. If asics and electricity were free it would be easy to attack bitcoin.

~~1 - only the covert method can be stopped with a soft-fork.~~
2- A hardfork is on cores roadmap anyway. 
I dont know why people have an aversion to hard-forks eventually you must perform them. They are in-fact extremely safe if they activate with 95% of the hashpower because the nodes that dont upgrade will stop syncing and it will be obvious a hardfork has occurred. Now a user activated soft-fork which everyone loves is far more dangerous its likely to split the chain an cause replay issues if both chains survive. 
@_date: 2019-04-28 21:14:07
Most miners just connect to pools and let the pool operators handle consensus. Look at the current pinned post by bluematt.
By definition this makes the miner an NPC's. Btw segwit2x was nearly successful they had over 75% of the hashpower and did not actually hf due to an off by one bug.
So even my gut instinct is based on some facts and reasoning, mining is too centralized and this is caused by pools.
Look at betterhash
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:51:39
Yes i agree bitcoin mining pools incentives miners to become npcs. That's why bullshit like segwit2x became possible because pool operators and some big miners were representative of 90% of the hsshpower.
If bitcoin core introduces a contraversial hf without discussion how much of the pools would switch to the new version and would miners even care?
We don't really know - because this has never been tested. This is why mining needs to be fully decentralized..

@_date: 2017-04-25 01:31:11
u/luke-jr I should clarify, when i say HF i mean a HF with 95% hash power support ( high security requirement ).
If something activates with a HF like this, the old chain will not grow and nodes that aren't upgraded will no longer sync any blocks. So wallets connected to these nodes will look like they are frozen.
In this scenario the old chain immediately dies and cannot be re-booted without the use of another hard-fork. 
* 1 - Are you saying this is dangerous as users will try and send their bitcoin and it will look like a pending transaction for ever but actually the bitcoin got sent?
* 2 - Do wallets have a warning that detects when they are not synced with the network for the above scenario?
* 3 -  **Maybe replay protection should be mandatory for every hard-fork to prevent the above points**
Now a UASF is a soft-fork with no security requirement and can activate with any hash-power support. It is likely therefore for two functioning chains to exist. If exchanges support both chains an allow you to swap tokens between them, users would need replay protection. Replay protection cannot be implemented by a soft-fork right?
* So do you agree a high security HF is better than a low security soft fork (UASF) based on the above scenario? 
If i am wrong can you please outline why a low security soft-fork (UASF) is safer than a high security hard-fork thanks.

Value of people being able to run wallet nodes is that they can support a hardfork of bitcoin.

Correct, but if there's are another set of nodes following the old rules, they could serve those nodes given enough economic support.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:01:48
There is a potential solution . The reason why pow exists is because it's impossible to implement an objective protocol that's implemented in a decentralized network without a consensus system to remove the subjectivity of time. The whitpaper talks about this. Pow orders blocks therefore effectively creates a decentralized time server.
But if there was a way to someone have absolute time implemented across a decentralized network using some kind of quantum entaglement. It might be possible to have a decentralized peer to peer cash system without pow or even blocks. Txns will simply enter a ledger... 
No block size, no energy wasted, a currency that works across vast distances in space. This might be the final evolution of moment money.

Thats like saying a divorce is an attack. And no you can't use any means to stop the divorce.
I don't consider a HF an attack. People are exercising the free will in supporting a different protocol. This also does not harm anyone other temporarly reducing the price. 
Proof of work change as a response is fine, but unecessary given how much hashpower core still has. But ddos attacks against BU nodes after the HF is illegal and would mostly result in retaliatory hacks and ddos attacks on core nodes and mining pools. This would truly make bitcoiners look like retards.
In terms of the price a HF will have the same effect of people selling the bitcoin or moving to alts neither of which are considered attacks on bitcoin.

Old nodes don't need to upgrade, of they don't the whole system will split creating two coins, if old nodes have enough miners. 
Imo, this is one of the core properties of bitcoin. Ironically this means bitcoin is quite easy to change if you can convince enough people. 
This means no single party can take over bitcoin not miners not devs, becuase bitcoin will just hardfork and split. This is a good thing...
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:58:12
are u suggesting people who hold 0.1 bitcoin have the same economic power as those holding 1000 btc. 
If the coin hard-forked into two, supporters of each would dump one coin for the other. The one which would be valued more would be the one that has more holders.
For example if satoshi supported the bigger block chain, rest assured the small block chain would be worthless if he dumps his coins. 
The point is to quantitatively measure how much economic support a protocol change has. This is far better than falsely claiming everyone supports segwit and everyone who doesn't is a shill.
Because there is a large block camp and they generally dont support cores direction. Now what I am interested in is what percentage of holders support larger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:48:17
They are right the  ability to hardfork  makes  bitcoin decentralized. Ie no one can control the direction it will go, only the free market. However to have a fork ready you need different teams with alternative clients and wallets.

If everyone had all thier bitcoin on mtgox and did mtgox to mtgox transactions it would be equivalent to the modern fiat system. Sure the blockchain would be small and everyone could run nodes but it would be pointless in the end.
So yeah making nodes slightly harder to run does not make bitcoin worse then Fiat as it still operates with good monetary policy.
The only way that is possible if we are forced to store bitcoin in coinbase inorder to spend it.
@_date: 2017-04-12 11:14:32
The worst thing is, is that UASF doesn't implement replay protection. If the fork happens without overwhelming hash power support there will be two functional chains. The attitude here, is that the old chain is 'an alt coin' or a 'shit coin' especially it forks to BU - so we dont care about those coins. 
So segwit transactions can be replayed on a chain which is still functioning. This is a **BIG** issue for those who want to dump the alt coins in order to drop their value - and you should if you want the segwit to win more hash-power. So if you are doing transactions on the new chain **DONT USE SEGWIT UNTIL THE OLD CHAIN IS DEAD ie negligible hash power**, otherwise your funds on the old chain could get stolen. 


This is kind of difficult, if there are functioning systems as a result of a contentious hardfork - Bitcoin under the new rules, and bitcoin under the old rules. BU &amp; Classic supporters will keep mining on the old chain and they might later hardfork.
**but the issue is for a while there will a period where we don't have replay protection**
Softforks are great if the majority of the hash-power support it, because old and new nodes will quickly converge to the same blockchain.
However a time activated soft-fork with low hash-power support is dangerous as its likely nodes will converge to different block-chains. This will occur if miners publish a block that is invalid (does not signal segwit) under the new more strict rules enforced by UASF nodes. UASF miners will mine on the longest 'valid' blockchain which will be different.
**People have called me a 'troll' and a BU shill, despite me not supporting BU. In-fact if they don't fix ASICboost I will support core even if they have smaller blocks.** 
My concern as a user is that, I want to safely hold both coins until i am certain which chain will survive and this is not possible without replay protection. 
If we are going to do a time activated soft-fork ( which has never been done before ) we are better off doing a time activated hard-fork with replay protection. Off course I would prefer if both sides can compromise but I doubt this will happen. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:47:22
This guy's wrong, there was nothing stopping the BU hardfork. They just didn't attempt to create two new coins even though they had enough hashpower, so it's not failure unless you try.
This is a strength of bitcoin, if people in the future want to continue the minning subsidy and violate the 21 million rule, people who oppose this can continue in a network that does not.
This bitcoin, is not imutable, it's mutable via free market conditions. This is the perfect balance imo

In terms of security 
soft-fork &gt; hard-fork &gt; low security hard-fork (UAHF) &gt; low security soft-fork (UASF)
I am proposing a hard-fork because you can accomplish more things easily with a hard-fork. Instead of getting rid of asic-boost implicitly via a soft-fork I wanted to make it impossible. This is seems only possible via a hard-fork (both overt and covert methods blocked ).
The bitcoin block-size limit will eventually need to increased... so one will eventually happen. Its just hard-forks takes more effort and need more time because people need to upgrade their nodes.

Hardforks are safer than user activated soft forks. At aleast with a hardfork you can implement replay protection to limit the fallout of a chain split.
@_date: 2017-04-25 00:02:28
Hardforks are safe if activated with high hashpower and if they are not contentious, that's all I was trying to say.
The reason is when a HF occurs the old chain cannot grow because the difficulty is too high. So the old chain dies immediately and there's one functioning chain. As long as the HF change its not contentious with the user base it's completely safe. 
If it is contentious a POW change and a difficulty reset is required to reboot the old chain, this is accomplished via a HF.
Surely now you can see HF are powerful right, they are a necessary option of decentralized systems

Got an answer from the other sub,
Replay protection is impossible to implement in a softfork. So why not hardfork segwit with replay protection instead. It's pretty clear bitcoin is going to split into two coins. 
This way users don't need worry about coins getting stolen on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:46:48
You guys realize the UASF does not have replay protection. Are you sure the other chain will die or will it survive like ETH and ETC. 
We would be better off hardforking with segwit and replay protection.
One side will allow centralized miners to change a key property of the blockchain.
The others side will user-softfork without replay protection because it's apparently safer. So people can send transactions that look like anyone can spend transactions to the other chain...
What a mess I don't support either side now...
@_date: 2017-04-24 07:45:17
yea your right point one is wrong. It cant be fixed by a HF as well. Via a soft-fork its blocked implicitly. Miners using asicboost will simply not include segwit transactions so small miners will benefit as they wont be shamed to not using it.

I don't think non-listening nodes have inbound ports open. They may connect to multiple peers but They would just leach new blocks and only broad cast your transactions.
Assuming they're all using default Bitcoin Core settings, they'll each provide 117 connection slots to the network on net (125 provided minus 8 consumed). SPV nodes typically use 4 connection slots, and full nodes typically use 8. So the network can support a maximum of around 170,644 SPV nodes or 85,322 non-listening full nodes at one time. 
So bandwidth requirements would be less. It would be good if we get calculator for running these nodes, listening or non listening. 
You are right, we certainly shouldn't get to a stage where nodes need to run in datacenters.
However, I need to see number or some kind of calculator before believing 2mb blocks are too big to run non-listening nodes at a minimum.
Also currently payment gateways have imerged as some merchants don't want to hold bitcoin, but if it's because it's cheaper to use one, that's another economic insensitive which I want to avoid creating.

today mining pools are responsible for consensus, they run the full node, they create the blocks and select transactions. There are relatively few mining pools. Inside the pools there are a bunch of NPC slaves that get to mindlessly solve work like a indian child labor factory. It is unlikely these children will be active in governing the protocol unless there is a massive social media campaign/ social engineering - to get them to move to another factory. Mining pools encourage miners to sit back and be NPCs ( while many aren't over time this will probably happen )
BetterHash is where individual miners run nodes and create the block templates, but share the reward using a pool. Miners a responsible for consensus and there are thousands of them, therefore it's impossible to approach 10 people that represent the majority of the hashpower.
Look at BCASH, this is a perfect example of complete dev centralization, their dev can privately discuss new consensus rules with a few pool owners and basically force the hands of small miners. They can easily change their protocol every 6 months. They even introduced 'reorg-protection' which breaks POW consensus. Many Bcash miners are also BTC miners many switch between both based on profitability. This proposal will ensure Bitcoin will NEVER become like bcash. I used to be a bcash supporter because I believed their scaling solution - but i reluctantly realized how centralized their project was. To top it all of it was centralized into the hands of incompetent developers.
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:17:52
Thank you for the sanity.
Segwit was designed to be deployed as a soft-fork - obviously. The UASF is not really a traditional soft-fork and it would most likely result in same behavior as a contentious hard-fork without **replay protection**.
Therefore Segwits activation via UASF would be more dangerous than a properly implemented hard-fork with replay protection. 
A hardfork with replay protection is bitcoins final defense against centralization it should not be used lightly as it there will be economic and political fallout depending on how fragmented the community is. Thankfully Greg has prevented us going down this insane path.

UASF is the definition of a contentious fork. 
At least with a hardfork at 95% hashrate **guaranties the old chain dies at the moment of the fork ie its impossible for the other chain to grow without a manual difficulty adjustment**. A hard-fork is far cleaner and safer than a contentious 'user activated' soft-fork....  u/luke-jr do you disagree? 
In this sub I get blasted for even thinking a hard-fork might be required to **fully block the asic boost optimization (both covert and overt at the same time)**
I know how hard-forks work and they are only are contentious if mining is completely centralized ( which it isn't yet ... )
I also understand that regular soft-forks are safer than a hard-fork because it does not require people to upgrade their nodes. Its only safe if activated with a high security level eg with 85-95% of the hashpower similar to a hard-fork. 
User activated soft forks are dangerous and not responsible, its basically a soft-fork with no security requirement. It will likely fork the network where the re-org may never happen and replay protection may be required because then we have two crypto currencies in operation.

S2x was introduced by a rouge dev team, if bitcoin core decided to increase the block size next update without discussion here, that would be a good test.... Would Chinese miners just blindly upgrade the 'official' client or would they run the old client.
This would be a good test, this kind of bullshit HF happens all the time in the bcash world and miners blindly update. So i am not confident with how BTC miners would do.

Yes because bitcoins economy is still centralized. Without a bitpay there's few merchants that accept Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-30 11:15:10
seriously, we should come with an official block-chain voting system, which cannot be censored and can be publicly verified by everyone. 
Or maybe it could be a new way to signal consensus. Basically a POS driven fork. The idea is everyone votes with their bitcoin holdings using a special transaction, once you vote your bitcoin is locked. Everyone can see how much people have voted ( increase the block size or keep it the same ).
The code could be like after a certain date, if there is enough support for the increase activation beginnings.
Either way guys POS voting is actually the best way to determine the economic majority, we just need a system that is opensource and can be verified by anyone.

reorg protection means nodes reject blocks if it was apart of a deep reorg. This is idiotic the whole purpose of POW is to solve the double spend issue ( reorgs ). Bcash devs are complete idiots and don't understand the whitepaper

People who say this don't understand fiat....
If bitcoin adoption rose substantially I could probably afford to build my own data-enters lol.
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:50:01




with 16nm chips the difficulty would increase, so would the total work required to re-mine the whole block-chain from scratch. Each block is secured by the difficulty of blocks above it. 
So we should strive to have blocks generated using the most efficient technology possible. If we keep changing the POW to prevent mining centralization ( ie mining is done by GPU and CPU ). Someone might secretly create an asic to mine.... 
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:41:58
umm not really, different development teams represent users. For bitcoin to be decentralized there should be multiple competing implementations.
See what happened when there is one development team, in the case of ethereum they just decided to hard fork to recover the doa funds because they were personally effected.
The classic folk had to quickly organised and create a new client &amp; infrastructure to support the original chain. 
The fact that there is a conflict between Bitcoin core, and unlimited is sort of a good thing in a way. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:49:40
It would be minority hash rate fork, which means both chains as a result of the fork would continue to grow. Segwit was designed to be activated in an environment where the old chain would immediately die. This is not possible without the majority hash rate support.
This means until the old chain dies ie loses all hashrate you cannot post segwit transactions or you will lose funds in the old chain. 
The old chain would have to be hardforked again to implement replay protection. Because core developers would never implement It because they hate hardforks....
If you have minority hash rate support the only safe way to activate segwit is a dam hardfork. A minority hash rate fork of segwit is dumb and reckless.... Why can't people understand this ....
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:20:41
Asicboost needs to die more important than blocksize debate imo
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:17:09


I would say that's an X for the last column. If segwit activates its only secure on the chain where segwit is enforced. 
This is a problem because users need to sell their 'alt' coins before they can use segwit. If you dont care about alt coins, wouldn't you care if you could convert your alt coins to bitcoin at some point. For example I would be pissed if my ETC got stolen before i sold it for ETH for example.  
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:38:56
I used this calculator, set peers to 2. It doesn't work with non-listening nodes for which the bandwidth requirement would half. I also set the 'labor' cost to zero obviously 
"If block size changed today, it would consume 503 GB and take 11 hours to download the blockchain from scratch on 1/12/18"
TOTAL: $13.016
per year ( with 2mb, with 8mb it would get tough to run a node )
**btw I dont run a node**, and probably never will until i make a distributed node that partly runs in the cloud ( the listening part , which only forwards to my local node so it acts as a proxy ). The wallet I used is the trezor online wallet. Most of my transactions so far are paying for various subscriptions; usenet and buying games from steam. These can already purchased using paypal and no government is trying to censor or restrict them. I Typically get a better currency conversion rate using bitcoin vs paypal so i use bitcoin. But if fees continue to rise and paypal becomes cheaper, bitcoin will lose most of its utility for my use-cases therefore becomes only a speculative asset. 
The wallet I use is the trezor online wallet and I am ok with sending my transactions to nodes managed by satoshilabs. I might run a mobile wallet and have a small amount of bitcoin there as well. 
I think I consider my self a typical bitcoin user, ie I did not just buy bitcoin to get capital gains. 
So from my perspective, I dont care too much about privacy and censorship of my transactions for *most* of my purchases. 
Now say I wanted to donate to wikileaks, this is something that could be censored. With today's fees, I can still donate directly to Wikileaks.. great. Now imagine what happens in several years time if we keep 1mb blocks. The lighting network will be implemented and most users will use this. As I understand the lightning network is sort of like opening a bar tab for shops you spend stuff to. So bitpay could have a lightening hub for merchants that sell through bitpay and I would definitely use it for 99% of my current use cases.
The block size is low, everyone can run nodes at home cheaply and also transactions are cheap.
Now what if I want to do a one-off donation to Wikileaks. Well Wikileaks cant use bitpay or coinbase who I have opened channels with, because the US government has regulated the major payment gateways that run lightning hubs. If wikileaks has a lightning hub, I dont want to open a channel just for a one of donation this would be stupid. Therefore the only way is to make a direct on chain transaction. Unfortunately because the majority of on-chain transactions are lightning network related ( netted transactions serving multiple users ), i would expect average fees to be higher. So say 5-10 dollars, now my $20 dollar donation to wikileaks seems impracticable because bitcoin has turned to a settlement system. 
I am honestly worried the lightning network will encourage the formation of large payment gateways like bitpay. Sure bitcoin settlement transactions cannot be censored but if on-chain transactions get priced out then we effectively get censored via the payment gateways. What I am describing is the concept of 'economic decentralization' which needs to be balanced with network decentralization. 
this point is mentioned here:
PS the reason I like bitcoin is because it has good monetary policy, I did not get into it so I could make 'unblockable transactions' this is a good feature but was not my main motivation. This is just my perspective, hope its useful.

Since when can a coin be judged by its single creator. If Satoshi was around and was a complete asshole would you delist BTC. No because one personality is irrelevant because BTC is decentralized.

People have a right to hardfork. If you can convince your hf is better than the original chain then more power to you. More importantly is difficult to stop unless you are willing to attempt ddos attacks on thier nodes or try mining  empty  blocks. 
People that will support the hf are dissatisfied with the current bitcoin, they will either  move to alts or sell out so a hf is best  for them. 
If they create bu coin this whole debate will be over, core and large  block supporters can have there way.
@_date: 2017-04-16 21:41:10
By pre-mine do you mean hard-forked history of bitcoin blockchain alt coin? 
That's precisely what a hardfork will achieve - a premined alt using bitcoins history. 
I actually want this, BU miners will move to thier chain alowing segwit to activate safely as a soft-fork. Everyone can move forward, I am sick of this stalemate. 
I will be invested on both chains and will hold the more useful coin - in the long term.

@_date: 2017-04-30 22:45:41
Actually it needs more because of spv wallets.
But we need to increase to blocksize to meet current demand, this won't make bitcoin suddenly centralised. 
People who say bitcoin will be banned suddenly if we can't run nodes in TOR are to paranoid and such mentality is holding bitcoin back. 
The easiest way to stop bitcoin is to go after payment hubs like bitpay and coinbase. Then bitcoin would lose allot of its utility. On the plus side blocks wouldn't be full anymore even with a 1mb limit...
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:26:17
* 1- wait then why is it dangerous to send segwit transactions now?
* 2- I think i see what you mean, old nodes will still accept segwit blocks and Segwit nodes will still accept current blocks, except it has new stricter rules on how to process segwit blocks.
I was under the impression a soft-fork meant stricter rules so blocks published under the old rules may not be valid. For example would **reducing** the max block size limit be considered a soft-fork or a hard-fork?
I think it would be a hard-fork...
Edit this is where i learned about soft-fork vs hardfork

Here it mentions a soft-fork only works if it has more than 51% of the hash-power otherwise the chain will split. Where old nodes build a chain valid under the old rules and new nodes build a chain valid under the newer stricter rules?

UASF is not going to work with segwit. I thought people understood this now. What it will achieve is to operational blockchains with zero replay protection.
In order for one chain to die economically little need to be able to safely sell your coin. You cannot do this without replay protection.
UASF will result in massive market instability it's worse than a hardfork.

I would support a user activated hardfork of segwit with replay protection.
But a user activated softfork of segwit will result in a chain split. In which case you will need replay protection....
Without replay protection you cannot post segwit transactions as you risk loosing funds on the other chain. This is incredibly irresponsible and dumb.
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:21:47
No its not. 
Hardforks are easy to implement the question is can you convince the rest of the network to go with it. Convincing people is hard thing, but its not bitcoin software that makes it difficult - it is do due to the nature of free will.

@_date: 2019-04-08 20:55:43
When the block reward runs out fees need to replace it. Unless you want to everyone to pay 1000s per output you need to increase the volume of txns per block to make Bitcoin functional.
Fees also diminish the amount of spendable savings you have too so they can't go up to far. Eventually the block size must be raised somehow.
Also bcash does not use bitcoins code anymore they have reorg protection which fundamentaly violates the pow architecture. It's a completely broken and centralized project.
@_date: 2019-04-28 21:04:50
Yea if fees were consistently 50 dollars per output chances are 100% of merchants btc wallets would be come uneconomical to spend if they didn't not consolidate their outputs.
There is an upper bound on fees..
We must balance fee pressure with volume of txns. The LN network will help with this and might help reduce unconsolidated outputs allowing us to keep block size as small as possible for the current amount of users
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:40:58

If segwit activates with 95% of miners on board the chain supporting the old rules will stop getting built. But people are talking about a UASF, which means arbitrarily applying stricter rules without any security requirement.
Some people think because its a soft-fork a UASF will not result in a chain split but they fail to realise that F stands for 'Fork' in UASF and given enough hash-power the chain will split.

Yea I am a big block support but I agree with this, right now bitcoin is suitable as a reserve currency. However there are no bitcoin backed banks, and there are no settlement layers working yet. 
However I still think we should increase the blocksize to what's practically possible to meet short term demand... 
At least with this compromise it will avoid the fork.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:23:06
Bitcoin is permissionless and that fork did not receive enough network support to activate.

Non of what you said is quantified, you are just blindly repeating what some scare mongering  some else made up.

@_date: 2018-11-06 10:47:22
Regular HFs turn miners into npcs honestly most miners are npcs and run whatever software they think is official but regular HF reinforces this paradym. Bcash differentiate them self as having multiple implementation but really there is only 1 in control especially after sv forks away. That is Bitcoin ABC.
This generally is not a problem for most currencies but BitcoinABC is quite incompetent. So I see bcash failing....
They plan on implementing preconsenus - like what's the point of mining lol... An other dumb this worse than increasing limits ie reducing the block times. Which increases orphan rates even when nobody fills bcash blocks.
So yeah large block supporters might come back to btc if bcash fails ;)
@_date: 2016-09-18 12:18:53
I am OK with any fork, the whole point of blockchain applications such as bitcoin is that people can come together agree set of rules and implement them without arbitration.
This does not mean we all have to agree. Some people will want more immediate scaling while sacrificing some measure of decentralization. 
While others might prefer micro inflation to support a small and dedicated user base. 
When people cannot agree they must eventually learn to, agree to disagree and go their separate ways. 
However some people see a hardfork as an attack ... And we should blindly agree and follow core. This attitude is more dangerous to bitcoin than anything else.
Massive ddos attacks going boths ways and attempted 51% attacks could end both chains in the end

Like what's the average fees these days?
@_date: 2016-09-18 11:42:42
The real solution is to increase the blocksize to allow more transactions and hence more fees...
The current protocol states there can only be 21 million bitcoin, changing this would require a fork. In which case the network would be split. However I think this fork will occur far earlier. 
My point is that after most bitcoin has been mined, if we can't secure it using transaction fees alone It has failed because it hasn't achieved wide adoption.

Sure its inflation, but the protocol mandates 21 million bitcoin must be distributed. The alternative is an IPO...
The block rewards main purpose is to fairly distribute bitcoin. It also serves as an incentive to secure the order of transactions while the P2P cash system is still young. 
The idea is once the system is mature the market will determine the security required. If bitcoin is only used by 10,000 people every now and then, does it really need millions of dollars worth of inflation backed security?
My point is, creating inflation to unnecessarily inflate the required security of the consensus system is pointless. It goes against the core value of bitcoin. 
Also who decides how much security is required, why off course its the bitcoin core developer team. The whole point of bitcoin is that we avoid centrally planed monetary systems. Let the market decide what security the bitcoin consensus system needs, we don't need a bunch of software developers micro-managing the economy 
To add to my point, if we are to stay within Satoshi's vision the only way to keep bitcoin more secure is to support more users so there are more transaction fees helping secure the consensus system. Any attempt to create more than 21 million bitcoin would create an alt coin... it is the one part of bitcoin that is NEVER meant to change.

Yes it's very easy to identify you sent coins to a mixer. Also try mixing millions of dollars. If you want fungible btc buy xmr using fiat at an exchange then make 1 xmr txn then exchange it for btc.  Then you can pretend you never spent your xmr while having fungible btc.

Fee are too low is not really a good solution.  What it does is create a fee race until certain users are priced out or certain use cases are no longer viable.
If fees move to 20-30 cents per transaction, we can forget about adoption in poorer countries like India or even China to some extent. People will stop using bitcoin for smaller purchases as well.
We may not even reach that situation, because bad ux will stall adoption...

Worst thing about bcash is they no longer have decentralized consensus layer. They only use pow for the last 10 blocks. If the network falls out consensus devs will manually release a checkpoint identfiying the bcash chain. Bch is worse the BSV at least it follows the whitepaper still.
Only a complete idiot that doesn't understand how decentralized systems work would implement reorg protection. I thought it was a great idea when I was a noob years ago and done explained why it was dumb..

You realise tones of btc will become unspendable if this happens. If people have their 100btc spread over many outputs most of their savings might be unspendable.

bch doesn't even have a fully decentralized consensus layer. It introduced weak subjectivity into its consensus layer instead of using POW. Mining is used only to order the most recent blocks then nodes will lock in the chain by refusing to reorg more than 10 blocks. 
This means if there's a reorg greater than 10 a hotfix must be done to manually select the 'right chain' by the centralized reference client for bcash ( bitcoin ABC ) .
How can bch claim to be the real bitcoin - it does not even properly implement proof of work. Therefore its consensus layer is more similar to ripple than btc - except that its grossly inefficient. 
Yet the LN makes bitcoin more centralized? A second layer cannot make the first layer more centralized - because its a second layer... It's like saying the internet is centralized because there are online banking websites.

if you are a merchant that wants fiat it is easier to use bitpay or something similar.
So you think merchants like microsoft want to accept bitcoin natively will then automatically sell it on the exchange - also keep track of capital gains, handle refunds. How  do you think this is easier than just using a payment processor?
If I was a merchant that wanted to accept bitcoin but wanted to receive fiat without worrying about exchange rates I would use bitpay or something similar.
This is not propaganda its simple logic if you think about what you have to do.  Not all merchants have talented RnD departments or want to use them for such a project.
But I agree if bitpay is restricting payments based on you IP this is incredibly annoying - there should be more alternatives. Its easier if merchants dont want to hold us dollars

Until btc is widely accepted, it's value will be measured relative to fractional reserve asset. When the fractional reserve supply contracts asset prices fall, share houses and Bitcoin.

Dev scheduled HF lead to centralization or a mining community that are passive. This is why it's important to use something like bip135 with a very high activation threshold so even small miners can veto a change.
SF are better especially if the mining community is plagued with dumb NPC miners.

Do you allow merchants to settle in fiat? If not you can just release a library that does the same thing. There is no need for SaaS.
It's like instead building a maths library for C# but delivering it as a service (SaaS) why? Because EVERYTHING is moving the cloud.
If it was a custodian service where you allowed merchants to settle in fiat or crypto and you process funds then forward it, a SaaS solution would actually make sense. Otherwise its pointless

Bip70 is good it prevents users deliberately settings the fee to low to perform trvial double spend. Something this sub consistently forgets about.

batching transactions is different to trying an consolidate your coins into a single output. 
To consolidate each output there will be a fee, which might eat up say 50-80% of that output. Creating one giant transaction will still cost a tone and might eat most of your bitcoin. Most wallets now dont even have an option to consolidate outputs and this concept is not obvious to most bitcoin users. If fees increase like that again it will become a problem.  Also consolidating outputs hurts your privacy.  LN was meant to allow secure and instant small payments. Its never meant to replace all p2p payments.

This can get you kidnapped and tortured depending on how much you buy and sale.
If you use a KYC exchange only buy privacy coins like XMR with fiat then transfer them to your wallet before using it on BISQ to buy BTC.  This way the exhange only knows you bought xmr. You can explain you sent it to your cold storage wallet and you are holding it for speculation.

Those transactions are sparadoic.. You need a consistent volume of transactions...for consistent block rewards
How often do you open and close a transaction?
If the block rewards was zero with the current block size how much would the average txn cost?
What might happen is miners might mine some alt coin unit the mempool is profitable but it could result in wired instability in hashrate.
Another thing is onchain fees can't be too high or peoples Bitcoins become inacessible if it's spread across too many outputs.

gain of your receiver doesn't matter as it would also amplify the jamming signal as well. Its not like the satellite beam is a narrow beam that is very directional.

A ground transmitter has to deal with ground clutter but if its no a hill or a tower it can easily jam connections for miles.

its easier to block a satellite signal - a 1w transmitter sitting on a hill can jam GPS for miles.  Obviously if you want to block it across the country it might be harder (not hard for nation states). But it's easy to jam satellite signals due to the inverse square law of physics. 
I would say a mesh network which might be a combination of wireless and wired connections would be much harder to block
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:15:09
**reorg protection is not 'automatic checkpoints' its subjective protection.** Some nodes see the reorg and reject it - a new node that is syncing from scratch will not see it and will just use the longer chain. Therefore after such a split the client needs to update the consensus rules to include a checkpoint  defining the 'valid' chain using a nonsubjective consensus rule.
BCH is heavily centralized, both in development and its consensus layer. Furthermore bchabc dev team is abusing its power to force idiotic changes for the coin - crippling it and moving it further from what bitcoin was. Most bcashers are so blinded by their hatred of bitcoin core they cannot see this.

@_date: 2019-01-20 08:58:31
I think fiat currencies will alway exist - for the same reason people prefer to use a custodian service. 
If your the type of person that likes to use custodian wallets because its easier then maybe fiat is better for you.
Whats important is that fiat no longer has a monopoly over the medium of exchange - for this to happen the bitcoin network of users must grow and it must become easier to spend bitcoin.  
This mean users might rely on custodian lightning wallets for small amounts. Which i am ok with. While keeping savings in their own wallets. Other users might prefer to run their own LN nodes and wallets for better privacy and security. 
The LN needs to have better UX people need be able to top up channels somehow. The base layer should also scale so people with fragmented outputs do not lose 10-20% of their savings due to transaction fees. If BTC fees of a small transaction exceeds 2-5 dollars then people who bought BTC in chunks of BTC in $10 amounts better start using BCASH or something else. 
LN is a part of the solution - its far better than pre-consensus or whatever bullshit bcash is doing however we need the base layer to scale better as well.

Thanks for this, as long as the LN network doesn't not result in fractional reserve bitcoin, I am ok with bitcoin becoming a settlement network temporarily.
In Australia, there is not regulatory reserve ratio. The money multiplier model is bullshit. Banks can loan out what ever the fuck they want. This is why there is a housing bubble in Australia. 
AND THIS, is the reason i bought on to bitcoin. Because I refuse to let my buying power be stolen. The government under reports inflation in Australia as it does not factor in the rise in rent and house prices, it is a gamed metric. If you try and save in fiat you will be a slave for ever.

I am not against second layer solutions. But for the second layer to work the 1st layer must be functional. 
My point is, you cannot escape  the problems with the first layer even if you move into the second layer.  Everyone needs to aggregate their UTXO or their bitcoin will be undependable, users and merchants. Maybe with the LN there might be less need to aggregate transactions though perhaps. 
But right now its a real problem. It seems blockstream is intentionally  crippling layer one to force development of layer 2. Dont think this is a good idea.

if your jammer is on a high position - radio tower on a mountain it can be aimed down and I am sure some of the jamming signal will intercept your antena. Even if its not getting an optimal gain a ground transmitter can operate at high power levels and seeing as it's much closer the inverse square law would help.
nullc is right - jamming GPS is much easier.
But for state level actors I think jamming a weak satellite connection is not that hard - they could also directly approach the people who control the satellite and ask them stop giving the bitcoin node bandwidth.

ok i think i get your point. But yea 200 minute block times for 280 days would lower the price of the 1mb chain.
As the price of the coin goes down that 5% hashpower would vanish with it. I guess the hard core supports would remain. If miners continue to support the 2mb chain, I think it will win. Unless core is willing to do a hardfork.

well i was curious if the hardfork resulted in a bug that resulted in a duplicate nonce being used.
Like he signs a bitcoin transaction, then a bcash transaction but the wallet uses the same nonce for both as a result of a bug. Breadwallet only recently added support for bcash. I think this is unlikely but I cant verify it without expert knowledge.

an invalid block is invalid because it violates the consensus rules so it will result in a fork
Refusing to relay blocks that signal Segwit2X support will result in a hardfork.
Furthermore, if segwit2x activates there will be plenty of nodes to relay its larger blocks, we dont need your rasbery pi ok.

So with 5% of the hash rate the block time will be 200 minutes.
It will take 2016 blocks to adjust the difficulty. Therefore It will take 280 days without a hardfork for the old bitcoin to get 10 minute blocks again.
The remaining miners will get BitcoinCore mining rewards every 200 minutes instead of ten. The market value of the original bitcoin will have to increases substantially for it to be profitable to mine bitcoin while getting rewards every 200 minutes. 
There would need to be unanimous **large** holder support for the 1mb chain quickly gain hash-power. 
If the 1mb chain does not gain enough hash-power quick enough, it will very rapidly loose what little hash-power it has. Bitcoin core will need to implement a manual difficult reset ( hopefully not something retarded like bitcoin cash did ). If core are doing a user activated hardfork they revive the 1mb chain, they may as well change the POW, add replay protection &amp; change the address prefix.
This is why segwit2x does not need to implement replay protection, it is a miner activated hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:47:47
This is literally attacking the economic majority of bitcoin that support the two meg update.
Why do people call it Segwit2x, segwit has already activated on the main chain. Now its just a simple 2mb update.
The real reason people are crying about this is because for a short amount of time bitcoin core will have lost control over a tiny protocol change. ( upgrading block size to 2mb ) 
instead of spreading FUD, cant we have an honest discussion on increasing the block size to 2mb. Why is this a corporate take over - anyone can make this change.

as long as you dont sell for fiat and buy personal use assets like a primary residence or a car your bitcoin is exempt from capital gains. The key point is you have to purchase it with your bitcoin. 




the original acquisition cost of the bitcoin used to pay for the transaction is less than $10,000.
Capital gains tax will always apply when bitcoin are sold (as opposed to spent).  Bitcoin which is held for investment (not trading) will be exempt from income tax, but will be subject to capital gains tax, and the 50% CGT discount will be available if held for at least 12 months.
Another Example, You buy a wine for a dollar and ten years later its worth 1 million dollars. If you share it with your new girlfriend and as a result you have sex - do you have to pay capital gains tax ( because you disposed of an asset for goods and services? ). Australia says no. BTW Sex work is legal &amp; regulated in Australia as well.

you realize the higher the fees are the more bitcoin is destroyed because its uneconomical to use the outputs.

if bitcoin is decentralized it doesn't matter what software people run ( and who codes it ). Dev's cannot force protocol changes and expect others to follow along as this will result in a chain split. Because ultimately users will act in their own interests - that is how bitcoin is designed. 
There is an organisation that doesn't like that it is no longer the default implementation by miners and this is the real reason why te are seeing so much FUD over such a trivial change.
After the HF, miners can still run 'bitcoin core' if it remains compatible with everyone else.

original bitcoin all bitcoin nodes mined with their cpu. They created new blocks and added it to the local blockchain and broadcast the transactions. These are called full bitcoin nodes ( mining + network node )
Then people started mining with GPUs so then people created non-mining modes ( only the network part ).
Some miners only have ASICSs which are connected to a pool. Then pool runs nodes and outsources some of the POW. But they are a still considered to run bitcoin nodes.
So if some non-mining nodes ignore your blocks there will be others that dont. It will result in a hard-fork and at the end of the day the market decides which is worth more.

Scalability debates are hard because its almost impossible to find agreement with everyone. I agree that miners doing a miner activate hard fork for 2mb blocks at 85% hashrate is contentious. I would support it if it had 98+% of the hashpower. This would guarantee a chain under the old rules will not grow since the difficulty is too high. 
It is important to note, we only need agreement with participants of the bitcoin network - full mining nodes &amp; holders of bitcoin ( the more you have the more relevant your opinion ). There still will be people that disagree with such upgrade for instance lukejr wants blocksize to be decreased - even now. 
But if you think all BIP should be activated by the bitcoin core github - it is possible in the future that limited group of people who control the repo might have their own agenda. In which case having a community that believes bitcoin is defined only by what the reference client says it is a very bad thing. 
I think its a good thing there are multiple competing bitcoin repo, like btc1 and bitcoin core. 
But I think a contentious upgrade is a bad idea. Maybe people who want larger blocks should go and develop bitcoin c*** or something.

This is fud, I will get down voted for this but all btc1 does is increase the block size. 
If you patch core after it activates you can still use it.
This is how every update in the past was done, through a miners activated forks.
Btc1 cannot suddenly change the inflation limit or add giant blocks if this change activates.
Seriously, will 2mb centralize Bitcoin?
If you think so fine don't support it
If your ok with 2mb blocks and don't support btc1 because it's a different repo leading the change this time, then your an idiot that doesn't understand bitcoin.

Then why is everyone in this sub thinking 2x is a corporate attack? ( this is the main argument used to convince noobs against supporting 2x - fortunetly noobs generally have less than 1 btc )
There other coins, that have decide to scale from the base layer eg bitcoin c***. Bitcoin core and blockstream want second layers to do the scaling lightning and side chains. So there are two valid visions.
Why does bitcoin need larger blocks then. I dont see the point if you want to turn into a settlement network. I am invested in both coins so i dont want them competing with each other therefore i support 1mb blocks now.

so when btc1 wants to increase the block-size its an attack. but when core wants to do it its fine.


That fact that you think this, means you dont understand bitcoin. By this logic if a bitcoin core committer merged in code to increase the inflation limit all mining nodes will automatically upgrade to this new version.
Bitcoin is not fucken win10, there is no auto-update feature. So I dont think you understand how software development works for decentralized system. Mining nodes dont magically upgrade their software lol. 
That fact this this is the major argument against BTC1 is ridiculous because it means there are soo many newcomers can be easily engineered to believe something stupid. 
I hope 2x activates so people like you dump their coins. Even though I wish bitcoin to have 1mb blocks right now. 
If you are against btc1 because you think 2mb will lead to greater mining centralization fine.. but if you think it means btc1 commiters can do what they want like change the inflation limit or the blocksize further it means you have drunk way to much foolaid from this sub.

Once a double spend has occurred it's too late, and most 'ASIC' operators will find out in reddit after an attack has happened and it's too late.  In the bcash network nobody cared anyway so the pools that carried out the double spend pretty much have the same hashpower. 
My point, is having the ability to point to a different pool doesn't make you a miner. The pools run the mining nodes they are the miners - meaning there really only a few dozen miners + all the solo miners. 
In order to participate in the network you need to construct the block template or validate it using software you control. 
Its like saying hey i run a full node when actually you run a light node on a mobile, you can point it to different nodes but it doesn't add value to the network. Neither does running an asic except help increasing the difficulty for the whole network overall.
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:49:55

@_date: 2019-09-29 03:32:40
Most of the time people agree, because most of the blocks are not political. But when there's an actual misuse of the hashpower, most miners ( eg reorg a multi million dollar txn for double spend ), by the time asic operators find out, the attacking txn is already confirmed 100+ blocks down. The damage is done an irreversible. 
Some asic operators might change pool - after the damage is done. 
My definition of mining means, you need to mine on top of the previous block. ASIC operators don't do this, they get work from the pool and they perform hashes. This does not fit the definition of what a miner does. They *partially*  fill the role of a miner. 
Whether they can switch pools is irrelevant, to what they are doing in the present - which is deferring their responsibility to a third party

The cold card has a clear case therefore and have far better defenses against supply chain attacks and hardware supply chain attacks, because of its secure element it has no blatant vulnerability.

Bitcoin is decentralized, EVERY CHANGE needs to be accepted by participants (mining-nodes) in the system for it activate via miner activated HF.
Even bitcoin core could not change things like the inflation limit, if they tried now no miner would signal for that hardfork. 
Your analogy doesn't work. Just because mining nodes run btc1 now, doesn't mean they have to upgrade or stay with the software written by btc1. 
People have being arguing that btc1 is about taking over bitcoin development and not about a 2mb blocksize change. This argument is FUD and is only accepted because newcomers are still viewing software from a centralist mindset. 
Btc1 proposes a 2mb upgrade to the blocks size for bitcoin, you either support this or you don't. But claiming btc1 activation means mining nodes will blindly upgrade their software is ridiculous. 
If that were the case it is an indication that mining is far to centralized. This centralization wasn't caused by block-size but rather relatively cheaper power costs.

no, coldard supports passphrase. The passphrase protects you seed which is somewhere obviously. Everyone should use a passphrase to protect from this lol   






very bad UX, or it's going to be insecure. I want to use HW wallets to prevent the destruction of my seed, so there are HW offsite that can be used to move funds to a new wallet incase something bad happens. 


so there's a bug to extract the key, and a backdoor to do the same thing, from the hacker POV both achieve the same, why even argue semantics like this it's pointless. 






I dont assume a secure element  cannot have a backdoor. Security is built in layers, the secure element adds to security by removing simple physical access glitches that anyone can use and possibly adds a proprietary backdoor.  The probability of a manufacturer backdoor and its existence not being leaked by developers is obviously low. Pretending it's certain is just completely wrong and biased. If it exists there are other layers which mitage its effects - ***eg by using a passphrase. - which is already recommended.*** 
# Coldcard is more secure than trezor for offsite backup. 
For the trezor, you may as well just store you seed in different locations - which i think is a joke. Amnesia mode doesn't solve this issue obviously either.

Given seed extraction vulnerability exists in a HW wallet and its trivial. having a paper seed + passphrase is equivalent using a HW + passphrase. Therefore the HW wallet only protects against online attacks.
And only the passphrase protects against physical attacks. If you are OK with this by all means go keep using a trezor. But it's no point buying multiple devices for the purpose of cold storage as you may as well just store the seed.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:47:33
I dont trust a MCU to hold secrets that aren't secured by a strong passphrase, the threat that some secure element is backdoored can also be mitigated by using a strong passphrase.

The complete data sheet for the chip coldard card chip is released, there is no NDA required hence you can test it.  The only argument is that these types of chips are more likely to be backdoored. This risk is alot smaller than the risk of someone exploiting the MCU on my trezor... which is in the wild and trezor have made it clear they don't intend to fix it - except by asking people to use strong passphrases.

Pretend the fork didn't happen and suddenly 95% of the miners stooped mining bitcoin. Blocks will take longer, however now the block reward will be divided among less participants so in the long run your saying the profitability will remain constant? ( Is this what your saying?)
hmm, this is kind of confusing. Because I though with the bitcoin cash eda it was more profitable to mine when the difficulty suddenly drops. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:20:10
Yes r/btc are against transaction replacements. The funny thing is anyone can create a full rbf node to route these transactions to miners. Because it will increase thier profitability this is bound to happen.
Basing your economy on secure zeroconf is idiotic because eventually someone will just create a full rbf node
@_date: 2019-09-14 23:30:44
privacy coins are important because they are best onramp to BTC.
eg fiat -&gt; kyc exchange - xmr -&gt; btc
btc-&gt;xmr -kyc exchange -&gt; fiat.
Now the exchange cannot track every txn output you own.
XMR also focuses more on mining decentralization as they dont like ASIC's, the only problem they currently have are pooled mining. 
In reality there are only like a dozen true mining nodes. The owners of these nodes are the pool admins.  The people in the pool are ASIC operators and are not miners. To be a miner you need to know and create the block template using software you control. Using an ASIC does not require you to do this. You just power up an ASIC and by default it connects to antpool.
Once this problem is fixed, there can be more 'real miners' instead of having a dozen mining pools. If this is also fixed for XMR i might consider becoming a solo cpu miner for that network as well.

secure element is not more 'clouse source' than a generic mcu. Why is a mcu more secure than a crypto chip?
**Does atmel give the full design of the mcu chip? \_No\_ because this is proprietary information.** 
yet you still claim this '*closed source chip'*  has a higher chance of a back door than an atmel MCU. 


Are you actually trying to claim - that a generic MCU is more secure than a secure element?
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:41:29
Yes thank you, they would stop bitpay and a couple of exchanges and it would take bitcoin back to year 2, in terms of its utility. 
Greater economic decentralization and utility would protect against this type of attack. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 09:41:46
that's surprising... there is a  known vulnerability the the MCU trezor users that will leak its key. The passphrase argument is a non-argument because you can encrypt the key in the secure element with one too - in which case a backdoor is pointless too.
This vulnerability is unpatchable and doesn't require expensive equipment .
Your saying the risk of an unproven backdoor in a secure element is worse than **certainty** of getting your trezor hacked via an in the wild zero day MCU glitch. 
You are simply wrong, the MCU that trezor uses has a bug and is vulnerable and you **MUST uses a strong passphrase.** 
At which point, why not simply store multiple copies of your seed at different locations - sinces its secured by a 'strong passphrase' The trezor device only allows you to sign securely but cannot protect your private key by it self.

People in this sub have been fed fud to believe that when a bip suggested by btc1 gets activated ONLY btc1 controls bitcoin and they can do what they want.
There must be multiple competing teams contributing to Bitcoin protocol.

rust is a new systems engineering language that is guaranteed to be memory safety. They focused on creating a language that removed memory issues and other security vulnerabilities that can result from undefined behaviour most typically c++ code.
I didn't bother checking what language the projects used until they release the CVE description its hard to tell if rust would help.
it does other things by removing NULL - so there are null reference errors.  Having bounds checking on arrays, basically zero undefined behaviour, no memory corruption issue. A system to ensure all references are valid.  Mechanisms to mitigate data race issues. 
Its a good replacement for languages like C++. But it doesn't remove application logic bugs that can still cause security issues due to poor design.

if your using HW for offsite backup. You have a seed in one location protected by a passphrase. If the passphrase is destroyed ( and you dont remember ) . You can send your BTC to a new wallet using the offsite trezor. 
If there is a glitch to extract the seed from the HW easily, then under your threat model it is completely pointless using HW for this purpose as its equivalent to storing your seed offsite ( protected by a *strong* passphrase ). Therefore only buy one HW for secure signing. 
I will try to memorize my seed ( without speaking out loud ), however it's nice to have a backup plan.  Even if a use a HW like the coldcard that uses a secure element i will still use a seed with a passphrase - albeit with a slightly weaker passphrase. 
If the HW can defend the seed from most attacks that might access it, the passphrase its only being used to protect the seed that is in one location that you can monitor.
Eventually, i want to put a paper seed inside a biometric/pin fault that will automatically incinerate the contents if someone tries to break in or if i enter a duress password.  
Your paper seed should be the weakest link in your BTC storage security model  &amp; not multiple offsite HW that you can't monitor.

We need something like betterhash implemented asap to combat mining centralization.

the 2x upgrade does not violate the bitcoin social contract that is setup in the white paper. All it does is change an anti-spam constant from 1 to 2. So I dont see the big deal. What bitpay is doing is correct - bitpay should follow the most difficult miner activated fork, since the other fork will probably require another hard fork to keep it alive. 
The fact that bitcoins DAA changes every 2016 blocks means it is effective at resisting minority forks. If ethereum used the same DAA ethereum clasic would have been DOA unless they did a bitcoin cash like adjustment of the DAA. 
Now if the economic majority dump's their bitcoin to the bitcoin x1 chain hash-power will move to this chain, therefore bitpay will then say this is the official bitcoin. 
How else can they determine what bitcoin - is it based only on the rules merged into the bitcoin core repo? what if they decided to change the max coin supply?

despite what you think, bitcoins development is meant to be decentralized. If protocol is modified by one repository it can just as easily switch to another group.
core is loosing the support of the miners, and many users ( despite what this sub thinks ) there is plenty of support for 2mb blocks with segwit.  I dont see this as an hostile attack on bitcoin. It might be a hostile attack on bitcoin core. But bitcoin core is not bitcoin. Users define bitcoin as whatever bitcoin core says it is well they dont really understand the whole point of bitcoin.
Imagine if bitcoin core decided to add continuous inflation to bitcoin, would this sub blindly support this?

Note there is a personal use exemption, if you buy goods using bitcoin. Using bitcoin to buy alt-coins is not cashing out and I think this could be consider personal use. 
For explanation of the personal use exemption read this:


You trade bitcoin if you sell it for fiat, but if you 'spend' bitcoin to buy a game or some ETH i think this counts as spending and therefore the personal use exemption could apply. You better ask a lawyer though to confirm this.

common guys, bitcoin adoption is slowing down it will not grow exponentially now everyone knows about it. Scaling with the block-size will work fine for the next 10 years. The idea is hardware and networks will keep improving. 
Segwit will not improve the capacity of bitcoin immediately. I believe in 2 layer solutions, but cores approach is to force **ALL** transactions into the second layer and this is not acceptable.
Why does segwit transactions get a 75% subsidy, do they take less space... no
If we implemented segwit (no subsidy) + equivalent blocksize increase, I would support this as users are not forced to use segwit.

I actually talked to people who worked at banks in australia and they were like oh the reserve ratio i think its like 10% now. But apparently its 0%  I don't know how reliable wikipedia is but if i have some more time i will search for better links.
so yea people working in banks don't know what they are talking about, economic students are being taught lies. The whole monetary system is broken.

only because there is a block subsidy for it, really there shouldn't be a subsidy for a certain format of transaction.
Its basically a censored block-size increase. Imagine if transactions mined by bitpay get a block size subsidy. This would be bullshit and nobody would tolerate it.
Segwit should be released without a block subsidy, segwit transactions should be weighted the same and there should be a simple block size increase with it. This way you dont get that idiotic multiplying effect based on the number of segwit transactions that get into a block.

Hi i did not down vote :)
Your point is correct, but when a chain split like eth and etc happens, which is likely when the UASF activates holders will start being 'active' on exchanges.

@_date: 2016-05-16 13:51:29
Surely there must be a better way of preventing this kind of patent trolling. I wish bitcoin 'mining' was patented in such a way that made it so that if you enhance how its done your work needs to be released or cannot be patented. Like one of those open source licenses where if you modify and open source library you must release the changes. It's absolutely rubbish that someone can just piggyback on the invention bitcoin, make some enhancement and disrupt the whole system.

Don't use an ant miner the noise pollution for any air cooled asic is really bad. The reason is because air cooling is extremely inefficient. Hence the noise pollution. Asics will become much quiter and efficient when you use 2 phase immersion cooling. In summer if you have a pool you could try heat that using the heat exchange water. A large body of water takes a lot of energy before increasing temperature. If you want to heat the air, you could have a small resviour connected to a water cooler heat exchange which slowly blows air through a large surface area to dissipate heat. In this kind of system the asics would be immersed in 3m novek fluid ( closed loop )  which evaporates and liquefies. Unfortunately no body has made any asics like this, optimized for home minners...

I am sorry the concept that governments will unanimously ban bitcoin is absurd and they will do so by blocking nodes is also ridiculous.
This mentality will destroy bitcoin.
Obviously if they want to they will go after payment gateways and exchanges. Then your store of value will crash as it's mostly used for speculation.
Even if nodes ran in data centers, there would be nodes spread across more geographic location than mining nodes are currently spread across lol.
The problem with datacenters is that user driven forks are no longer possible. This is the major downside. 
If you want to make nodes difficult to take down, why not implement end to end encryption and make it so you don't use the same port range? The are so many other vunerabilities that can easily fragment the network.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:01:11
I think many people here have a narrow definition of decentralization.
Let me guess you think it mainly relates to how easy it is to run nodes, and mining. 
But their other factors that contribute to centralization, that larger blocks mitigates. So it's a balancing act. 
Users should be able to run full nodes, so they can resist or execute hardforks if necessary, whoever this does not mean we should run full nodes on raspberry pis or have nodes running through TOR. Such requirement are redundant and don't add value to bitcoins security.

wait are you saying its good to have a crypto-currency that must follow protocol updates from a single development team and all users must be forced to do this?
This is effectively how fiat operates, the whole point of decentralisation is that individuals have choice . Right now users have the capability of forking bitcoin and creating a different coin based of the ledger. The free-market would then dictated the value of all coins. 
This can be via a miner activated hard-fork or a soft-fork. The less users that can run nodes, the less that can participate in a fork.

You realize if you have outputs that are less value than the fee required to spend that outputs, then that bitcoin is effectively unspendable?
So as fees rise to 5,10,20,100s as bitcoin becomes a settlement network with 1mb blocks you will literally loose some of your bitcoin. 
I don't understand segwit or the LN so I can't strongly support it. But bigger blocks right now eg 2mb is simpler. It's easier to understand its consequences so I can spot it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:26:42
so basically small blockers want 1mb for ever and want to make bitcoin an alt-coin to support the lightning network. Great...
At this point its clear there needs to be a hard-fork so large blockers can go their merry way.

Would it be possible to invalidate all patents on enhancements to bitcoin? I mean if i made a new usb interface design that makes apple products easier to use, do you think apple would let me patent it. 
As i understand this patent is a hardware patent and it would only affect asic manufacturers. Which is problematic if there import bans on asics based on patent violations. 
Hypothetically, what if this patent was bought out by a patent trolling company, which has no intention of using the patent. It could use the patent to charge uneconomical licensing fees in the US and EU. They would then block asic imports into these countries... 
Initially I thought this thing was a software enhancement that did some pre-processing and thus could be pirated easily, however if the system is implemented in hardware this would be more difficult as there are very few chip manufacturers.
However it should be noted, this could happen again. And Politically hard forking like this, looks bad on bitcoin ( in terms of stability of the protocol ). 
I wonder if there was a way of licensing the invention of bitcoin such that this kind of thing is not legally possible?
Right now i feel the best attack against AsicBoost is to get the patent invalidated. The hard fork should be the last resort. 
Maybe we could buy the patent and release it under an open source license that prevents this kind of trolling. If they refuse to pay the price we want we can use the hard fork as a last resort.

A POS based vote is the fairest way to measure the economic support for segwit. Its more scientific than some dumb arbitrary and biased list created by a small block supporter...
people say such a vote can be gamed... well if you have a lot of bitcoin you have more say.. i think thats sort of the point. Large bitcoin holders have alot of power with regard to the price of bitcoin. We just need to make it on a neutral platform and open-source it so anyone can verify the results. Also if you vote and move your coins, the weighting of the vote needs to be dynamically adjusted.

Doesn't necessarily mean a single point. We are already seeing centralization as a result of mining pools. The more adopted bitcoin is the more difficult it is to stop.

A softfork with low miner support could operate like hardfork. 
All it takes a single miner to mine a block valid under current rules but invalid under segwit to fork the network. For UASF segwit this would require a modification of thier client but this split could be triggered by anyone if they got lucky...

yea also CSW didn't understand transaction replacement as implement in the original bitcoin client. 
He said RBF was shit, but transaction replacement was ok as long as the transaction hadn't reached the miner. This however this contradicts the original implementation of bitcoin, which featured general mempool transaction replacement.  
It was removed because it could be used to DOS mining nodes ( continually replacing txn's) forces miners to validate the new txn its replacing in the mempool. 
Furthermore, zeroconf is only secure for small payments. **If zeroconf volume was significant for high value payments** there would be substantially intensives for some mining pools to secretly implement full RBF.  Eg if you pay enough (0.1 BTC) we will replace your 100 BTC txn. Mining pools that mine these txn's will make slightly more fee's and its impossible to detect these pools because 'no rbf' is not a consensus rule. Its more of a 'lets play nice / gentleman rule'. This will especially hold true as the block reward is decreased.
For small low value payments 5-20 dollars there is an upper limit on the miner bribe to secretly implement full RBF, therefore these transactions are allays safe. This isn't the case for large transactions. 
So yea I dont think CSW is satoshi...
building a billion dollar payment system on 'secure zeroconf' is a bad idea in the long run. This is more suited for the LN, however we still need big blocks for the majority of the non-real time transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:22:04

so that's the reason for the discount? reduction of UTXO growth.... to be honest this is not even a problem.
Why not cache the UTXO to disk? Regular full node wallets dont need super fast access to the UTXO set. 
 
You will counter by saying it will make mining centralised. But mining is already mostly pools, these pools can afford to have servers with pooled memory to store the entire UTXO set.
UTXO growth is a very poor reason to explain why segwit deserves a 0.25 discount factor. 


really? Don't segwit transactions have fee's?
Segwit with is this discount looks like its trying to force everyone to use segwit transactions or pay even more ridiculous fee than today. 
Buts that what block-stream/core want right? force every transaction into layer 2 solutions. Then layer1 is used as a settlement network forever ( transferring very large amounts of bitcoin ). This changes the goal of bitcoin. 
If I want to pay for my usenet subscription or buy a steam game, I want that to occur through layer1. If I want to tip someone or buy a coffee I dont mind using layer2 solutions. But its looking more an more like bitcoin is going to turn into a settlement network for the lightening network. This is changing the long term vision of bitcoin.
Bitcoin adoption was supposed to scale with moore's law, we should let it do this until its impossible and continually work on implementing layer2 solutions. This is not cores direction, they want to 'over-engineer' something and create a complicated solution that can meet distant demand ( visa capacity ) and force this to  occur now.
I want these layer2 solutions to emerge naturally and not forced on us because of artificially created capacity problems.

Saying a few positive things about BCH does not mean your a bcash supporter. Sometimes people give some credit where it's due.
Some people say he was also trolling the BCH community, i don't really know.  
But what I do know ***(especially since I was a bcash supporter)*** that:
# people who are redditors for two weeks and attempt to attack someone's character and divide community members into black and white labels are more likely to be shilling than someone like cobra. 
BCH forked because they honestly believed in the vision that large blocks and on-chain transactions could fulfil bitcoins goal. I believed this too for a long time.
However, I saw how centralized the project became as result of continous hard-forking. I saw how big blocks were used in the hashwar to make the SV side more profitable - ironically r/btc started complaining against SV miners deliberately mining 32mb blocks ( satoshis shotgun ).
Then, the bcash core decided to change of its consensus layer works in an hotfix. They introduced a rule which rejects any reorg greater than 11, which is proof of stake in disguise - where there is one staking party that dictates consusus ( the developers ) .  While this idea was quickly questioned, any technical opposition to the idea was quickly drowned out by us - vs them arguments and low effort name calling.
Finally when the lower security network gets deliberately reorged to stop the unknown miner claiming the segwit funds the chain gets 51% attacked and everyone defends it.  Despite their being no censorship r/btc has somehow become an echo chamber that has effectively driven everyone with a different opinion out.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:10:41
Why not just spam the bcash chain or the sv chain. They stupidly have low fees so may as well use their block chain as a free back up service
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:35:46


 funny because in Australia - banks have no monetary required reserve ratio. They have capital reserve requirements where their assets - shares,bonds  must be 11% of all bank created liabilities. 
When they give out loans they create liabilities ( AUD ) and an asset in their balance sheet although the loan contract is worth less than the liabilities as there is a risk of you not paying back.
**So private banks create credit - and this IS a type of US dollars.**
The money supply is a giant rubber band. The band it self is continuously getting fatter as the reserve bank is pumping more base money. But market forces can expand the rubber band. As banks assets get more valuable they can loan more - but this create viscous feed back loops and boom and bust cycles. Bitcoin was create to stop this. 
I think its a misconception that only the fed creates money ( true of you consider base money ) but thats like saying the only money we use is cash - its not there are far more digital bank deposits due to credit and the credit supply effects the economy so you should consider it as money. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:30:08
In correct these aren't checkpoints. A checkpoint says a block with this hash is valid and that's the rule. In bch the rule is any reorg greater than 10 is invalid. This is reorg protection rolling checkpoints are impossible.

Btw bcash doses not use rolling checkpoints this is impossible unless you have some kind of auto updating software.
Bcash has reorg protection which rejects any reorg greater than 10. This is a subjective consensus rule that violates the white paper.
A checkpoint says a block with this hash is valid this is not subjective.
Bcash has weak subjectivity after 11 blocks therefore it's similar to a POS coin and only uses POW for the tip.

However it is still important for the fork with the lower hash power to have a sufficient hash power behind it otherwise there could be attacks on that chain. The hash power can't be to low either otherwise there would have to be a difficulty adjustment.

Bcash abc has a huge weaknesses, they implemented rolling checkpoints - max reorg depth of 10. This can be exploited to permanently fork the chain.
If this was safe you obviously don't need proof of work.
A split can happen in 3 blocks due to conditional daa and can grow up to 10 then it's permanent and has to be manually resolved using Reddit and Twitter
Maybe someone can write some software to do this, it would cost that much TBH now.....

yea perhaps, but there is no shame in a chain split. Like ETH and ETC, in the short term both coins tanked in value.  But in the long run they recovered. ( yet another opportunity to buy in  - probably the last) 
Maybe bitcoin will succeed as 1MB decentralized settlement network for the LN. That would be great. 
But I still would like to see if it could succeed using organic on chain scaling + LN when it becomes well tested and accepted. However I would always want the option to do L1 transactions cheaply

you realize, merchants are struggling because of fees? They typically have wallets with many UTXO with small amounts of bitcoin. ( from user transactions 5-100 USD amounts) They have to spend huge amounts of money try to aggregate these outputs. We are complaining about a few dollar fees merchants have it tougher because of small blocks. 
The big block lobby wont shrink, eventually they will get fed up and will have their own separate chain and 'alt' coin to use. Only time will tell if it will be worth more than your version of bitcoin ( settlement network for LN ).

not really, r/btc believe that by the time a lot of people actually use bitcoin - networking and disk space will be would have advanced enough and you could run a bitcoin node on a desktop computer. 
You are kidding your self if you think bitcoin will get visa level adoption any time soon. Even with no fee's bitcoin is hard to use for regular people. It will take ages and many big financial crashes before the transaction volume is a fraction of paypals. 
Adoption has increased rapidly because many people haven't heard about bitcoin, but now everyone has and its adoption will slow down.
Furthermore people might buy more bitcoin, but it doesn't mean there will be wide merchant adoption for day to day goods. Most people will look at bitcoin as an investment.... ( 1 or 2 txn per month at most ) 
So does bitcoin need to be a settlement layer... NO
I think it can be decentralized AND act as a internet p2p cash system for the near future unless something drastic happens. In the mean time we can research LN technology for micro txn's. This is why I support Segwit2x. We will have a good enough capacity increase for the near future and we can keep the community and the coin together.
frankly I dont support BU or classic. They don't have much needed features like OPT-IN RBF ( replaceable transactions ) which is important for security and holder peace of mind. Treating transactions in the fucken mempool like they are confirmed in the block-chain is the height of stupidity.

@_date: 2018-12-10 21:46:58
Thing is poor people will have small amounts of btc spread across multiple outputs. When they utilize thier money fees will actually eat a huge proportion of thier money.
They are better off using bcash or something else. If fees rise a large portion of thier holdings might become unspendable due to high fees.
Eg if txn fees rise to 10c per output and they have 5 dollars spread across 5 outputs 10% of thier holdings is effectively lost. Fees could reduce but they would have to wait.
Maybe the elite in third world countries can be saved using btc. I guess these people would be smart enough to use it as they are elite for a reason...

suppose the idea is that holders will hold balances in two coins at the time of the hardfork.

There are plenty of people who are against cores scaling approach.. which is to create a settlement network for second layer solutions.
I dont like BU approach, i find it a little bit uncontrolled. I prefer bitpay adaptive block-size approach or BIP100. Either way I want on chain scaling. I am not against the LN, but I think we need on chain scaling + second layer solutions at the same time. Core vision for bitcoin is completely different so i think its better if there is a chain split and we go our separate ways.

@_date: 2019-05-25 10:26:19
Yea i agree pools follow the first seen rule even though they don't need to.  My point was that this policy actually makes it easier for stable fee markets to form. Since you set a fee based on time required to get confirmations.
If every pool selected txns only ordered by fee, it's possible and transactions never get selected and drop out of the mempool. People get scared and pay too much fees for txns that don't need Fast confirmations. That leads to massive creep of txns fees until people get priced out of the network.
As long as some pools do this everyone can still use the LN by refilling your spending account from your savings.
It would be nice to know which pools do this. But gradually i can work it out by sending 1 sat per byte txns and checking which pool minded the block

Bip70 is required to avoid trivial zeroconf double spends. It forces the user to use the fee they decided.

If non fiat currencies are considered valid forms of money then why not use something that is open source, free and does not give facebook the ability to monitor everything you buy?

what he is saying is that before segwit was proposed people were saying a 2MB limit will result in more mining centralization, SPV mining ect.
The main argument against a blocksize increase was not because its a hardfork. It was- it would cause mining centralization.
Now segwit supporters are happy with an effective blocksize of 4mb. Suddenly nobody cares about block propagation issues. 
Its sad todays generations are so vulnerable to censorship and manipulation.

If you buy btc directly expect privacy to be exposed. You can try mixing services but this means someone knows you used the service and it might draw questions.
If people ask you why you bought xmr you can just say you bought it to speculate and that's it. You haven't spent any it's all in cold storage and that is enough to end that line of questioning.

maybe censorship has been decreased now, but I do remember a lot of people getting banned for being 'shills', 'trolling' and r/btc propaganda.
yea i agree the quadratic hashing attack should be fixed before increasing the blocksize. 
Even 1mb blocks this attack is possible. With segwit active this attack is possible for regular txn. Obviously with 2mb blocks the severity of this attack could be worse. I would hope segwit2x fixes this attack for regular transactions somehow.

Eg a single transaction cannot be greater than 1MB.

twitter polls are stupid, what matters is how much you can actually buy not the number of users. 
Obviously if satoshi decided to buy bitmain coins with his core coins it would absolutely tank the value of core coins visa versa. 
you are better of using a Proof of Stake Vote.
off course core supporters dont trust this, even though all the signatures are publicly verifiable. As the website is run by ver...So if you want let core host it...
You will reveal one public key when you vote, but not the master public key for your wallet. So I don't see much of a security threat. 
ETH did a similar POS vote before the fork to gauge how much economic support there was for the hard-fork. Ie how many people will trade ETC tokens for ETH.

Yep if you don't care about how long it takes to confirm you can even send a txn with 1 Satoshi per byte

You could use a thin wallet, like trezor online wallet...
