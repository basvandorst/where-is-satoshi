It's a pretty bad business model to copy others who were shut down and sued into oblivion. 
I would personally not be able to sell a product I knew had a good chance of hurting children even if it was due to their own parents negligence. 
"Since then, many children, perhaps more than 1,000, have swallowed various brands of small magnets and required surgery, prompting the Consumer Product Safety Commission to appeal to retailers to stop selling the products and initiate a recall aimed at Zucker’s company and two others."
And plus, you can buy 20x the amount of magnets for the same price on Alibaba.com w/o paying for the branding/packaging.

You say you don't sell magnets, yet in this post you refer to them as "my magnets". And you're pretty specific about the magnets in your other posts. Which is it?

Also, I was just looking at your profile - what kind of operation do you have going on that you submit hundreds of links over the last few hours?

Zero, okay that's enlightening - but I'll assume your volume is much lower than Buckyballs ever was.  
Knowing what you know, is there any concern that a small child or pet could eventually hurt themselves with your magnets?  Or do you feel that it is not your responsibility? I'm genuinely curious about your opinion. 
Your magnets are the same as these, no?

The recall has nothing to do with choking, as would 'anything small'. It has to do with the magnets being attracted to each other when inside the body - tearing holes through the stomach or intestines.
