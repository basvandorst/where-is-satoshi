You make no sense. Bill Gates won't invent new Windows. Warren won't invest in new trading market - crypto.
They are 70 now, not 20. If Warren was 20 now, I'm sure he wouldn't miss a chance.
This also means that one of us is a potential Warren that in 50 years people will speak about him as of legend.
And there will be a yet another market emerging, and herpy from 2068 will say "good luck guys, a Crypto-Warren from 2018 wouldn't invest into this"

And what monero was invented for? Or is it not using block chain?

Following your logic btc should have never dumped to 4K this year, yet it happened.
If you know there will be no time in your life without a job for a few months - either health, recession, or bad luck - my best wishes. High risk, - high reward.

It may be at 1k$ mark and all your savings for 5 years gone. Lose a job and you don’t even have money to last for a few months.
P.s. I own bitcoin, not trying to fud here

And you call me delusional, when you use terms:
- undervalued 
- eventually realise the value
20k to 4K is not a dump. Gotcha. That explains why it may never be valued at 1k.
We are captains of our own vessels. I hope you’re right. If it gets to 40k my portfolio will be doubled, while you may ride lambo. If it gets to 1k I’ll lose 20% of my capital, you - 90%. We made our choices. The reason I’m writing here is that I do not want other people to follow your “not delusion” that btc may not fall to the ground like many other great technologies humans invented.

Exactly. And demand can shift. Btc may have 0 demand in 10 years and all your investment will be gone together with prophecy of no future investment possible coming true.
