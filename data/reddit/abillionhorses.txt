That is unfortunately false, they will put your PayPal account on hold for selling ANYTHING RELATED TO BITCOIN (and not just bitcoin itself).  You'll be fine, but technically they can shut it down as they've done with miners.

Investing too much into BTC stocks when BTC was "low" around the 100s.  Stocks have come and gone, but many are not liquid ATM and haven't been for months.

Agreed, plus what happens when the next big Memecoin comes out?  As it is inevitable, IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:04:41
Not necessarily, especially if there is a gag order the authorities wouldn't cause more suspicion by moving the coins.  Karpeles has said multiple times that the coins are "lost" and not necessarily gone.  Does the government have his private key or has he forgotten his brain wallet key?

That's hilarious...obviously the person that wrote that doesn't understand how bitcoins are generated, how the network works, etc etc...obviously we all know bitcoin's power is in the blockchain and its decentralized nature.  Amazon coins would either the exactly the same or horrifyingly the opposite of bitcoin.  Basically they would either be an cloned bitcoin altcoin or they would just be sold at a flat rate for dollars 1:1.  These would basically represent variations of bitcoin and the dollar, simply shrouded by tech...nothing new or innovating.  It is significantly more plausible that people would prefer to use bitcoin over some sort of "Amazon Coin".  I wouldn't touch that shit with a 10 foot pole and I'm an Amazon Prime member :p

More exchanges and a multi-cryptocurrency wallet or open wallet API for people to use for their crypto stores.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:14:07
I think that Dogecoin is appealing to a certain niche audience.  Some say that they would be much more attracted to Dogecoin if they were new to crypto--well, "TOMAYTO, TOMAHTO".  I would definitely not be interested in Doge specifically because of its branding.  Just because there is an audience for the coin, doesn't mean it's a right fit for everyone.  Shibes are just as arrogant as bitcoiners.  People downvote "Dogecoin" because the hivespeak is annoying--over used memes are also annoying.  What do you think cryptocoiners will do once the next Memecoin is inevitably released?  I know that I am going to take a massive dump.

Peercoin is a good alternative to bitcoin if you believe what you're saying.  Basically 1% inflation rate per year due to users minting their coins via proof of stake.  Its a more secure and sustainable solution over bitcoin (although I support many cryptocoins).

There is a difference between talking and doing.  Yes, it is good to chat about ideas but you can't force an idea into every day use.  People will use what they prefer, and everyone is different. Talk all you want, but the people that use the terms (not just talk about using them) will be the ones to decide.  That's all I'm saying.  Fucking pick a term/unit and just use it, lol, it's not that difficult of a concept to understand.  The most popular will win.  You can't control what others will call a Satoshi unless it is introduced and forced at the core level of the protocol itself, and from what I've read of devs chats they do not wish to implement that.  It's pretty obvious from a computer lingo standpoint that "bits" is a poor choice but maybe the community will start using it...haven't seen anybody use it yet but hey, maybe it will catch on.  If you want a term be used, use it...I prefer "bitcoin" bc I understand the decimal system.  uBTC, bits, mBTC, and even XBT...pick your favorite and use it, instead of talking about using it and thinking you will reach a universal consensus for the whole worldwide bitcoin community.
Do you think people told others to use words like "sick", "rad", and "wicked" (etc) because they were better variations of the word "cool"?  No!  That's not how language works.  Use it or lose it, the proof is in the pudding.

I think that your perception of is extreme and arrogant.  You are actually just describing bitcoiners as left brain dominant thinkers, with your own added twist of extremism.  The majority of bitcoiners are ideological, meaning that beliefs and actions should coincide.  A branded memecoin is sort of the opposite of idealism.  That is not what crypto is about to a lot of people, including me.

@_date: 2014-05-03 15:15:30
The real decision will be made when people type out their microbits, bits, satoshis etc in their everyday use online and in person.  Change won't come from talking about which ones to use.  It will be natural.  Now you can try and force one over others all you want, but in the end it's the community that will decide when they USE the terms in communication.  This isn't something being added at the core bitcoin level that is like an official SI unit, this is language that will naturally evolve on it's own.  The market price affects which word people prefer to use as well.

I disagree.  Yeah some dumb coins like Dogecoin, Kittycoin, Potcoin, etc etc (all the generic scrypt coins) will die out but IMO coins like Peercoin or maybe even Vertcoin have potential.  I don't think they will overthrow BTC but there will always be other coins and competitors.  "Fooled by altcoins"...are you fucking kidding me?  Are you not aware of the many pro's and con's of them?  It's not all dumb generic scam/shitcoins.
  
How about Darkcoin?  That coin is totally anonymous...that has benefits for some.  I suppose if you're looking at these coins as purely investments...then sure some will die out.  That's not what it's about.  There will always be similar/alternative protocols that work on the blockchain IMO.  Ever heard of the properties of Namecoin?  These coins have different uses.

I didn't arbitrarily pick, I'm just at work so I can't post the exact data right now.  I remember the highest price of BTC was just like a dollar or so less than an oz of gold at that time.  It seemed like a such a natural response for the market to back off, so I'm curious as to what "Willy's reasoning" would be to back off at that point...yet not sell.

Meh.  A lot of writing and drama.  Get over yourselves, no protesting is going to fix the problem.  It's a poor situation but it's a technical problem.  If it's not a technical problem, and something more devious, none of this would help anyway.  Just wait it out like everyone else who was, unfortunately, naive enough to use MTGOX.
@_date: 2014-03-30 06:49:44
It's true and I agree with you.  I am just waiting until it goes a little lower so I can buy more (~$350).  I can't imagine it going any lower...I mean at $200...$100 I would buy a metric shit ton as would many others, I would think.
  
I am surprised people would sell at these levels too...this year looks and feels like last year.  It's fucking scary at times but you just have to be reminded of the positives during market lows.  So many more companies will adopt cryptos this year (exponentially more than last year).  I know I am starting a shop soon to sell products in crypto and so is a family member who I didn't even think was familiar with cryptos!
  
Sad thing is that MTGOX is gonna hurt for awhile...and the effects will linger...I feel like people are waiting to buy because of recent "bad news" and that once we hit the bottom where people start buying, there won't be immediate upward movement.  That being said...I do think we will see a huge rally at the end of this summer.

You dont want to convert to fiat yet you say BTC is too unstable?  So you don't want fiat but you want some sort of magical BTC that doesn't change in price.  I think you should either make the decision to accept BTC and save the BTC or convert it to fiat immediately upon receipt.  This double spending you are talking about makes no sense, I highly doubt that's what happened and if it did it was your own damned fault for not realizing it.  Yes BTC is not stable at the moment, but there are quite a few ways to reasonably accept it and not screw yourself over.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:58:14
Wow, impressive of you to remain a lurker for so long!  Congrats on taking advantage of Coinbase's offer and welcome to the wonderful world of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:25:40
Same here.  It's beyond cringeworthy.  The truth is that all cryptocoin communities have some bad apples and negative nancies.  "Shibes" are just as arrogant as bitcoiners, and especially more naive.  I think that if you did a poll of the median age of Shibes you would find that most of them are under 20.  That's fine!  It's just that I believe that Doge is only valuable to a certain niche audience.  Not just age, but maturity, social scene, etc...  
  
What will the next popular Memecoin be?  What happens when newbies find a new coin that is funnier than the last?
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:40:29

I've never felt that way about the BTC community.  I think that you just had a bad experience.  That's too bad...everyone has been so nice to me in the BTC community.  With money, comes power trips and snakes.  When Doge gets bigger you will have more of them too.  Shibes are just as arrogant as bitcoiners.  You really shouldn't stereotype.  It is naive, IMO, to think that Doge will remain this popular or get more popular.  Yes, there is an ever revolving group of teenagers in the world, but there will be newer funnier memes in the future.  What happens when the next big memecoin is released? When easier money is available elsewhere, most will dogs will jump and only a few sad dogs will still bark ;)

More services and Altcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:51:01
Altcoins are not dead ends or harmful to the goals of Bitcoin.  Does bitcoin provide a decentralized DNS like Namecoin?  Does it allow purely anonymous transactions like Darkcoin?  Is it ASIC resistant like Vertcoin?  Is it proof of stake like Peercoin?  Some purists don't understand the true mentality of crypto fans and newbies.  They are jealous of these other coins and they think it is taking away from bitcoin's market cap. Well...to a certain extent it is true that they are taking away from BTC's market cap, but it's negligible until others get more popular and really start competing.  It's not about trying to "all play nice"...it's survival of the fittest.  I know there will be more than one coin...it makes no sense for only one cryptocurrency to exist.  People will always want a secondary coin.
  
Bitcoin got popular because of its strong technical fundamentals.  The "nerds" and smartypants knew this and it was undeniably a great buy.  It is extremely daft to say that bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency ever.  Yeah sure the dumb generic scrypt coins will all die out (Doge, Kitty, Pot, etc) but coins like Peercoin and even Vertcoin have potential...Namecoin too (along with others I didn't mention) because of their undeniably strong fundamentals.

@_date: 2014-05-23 18:49:56
It's okay to start with a hot wallet (web based) but if you do, at least use two factor authentication.  Also don't put more than a bitcoin in it (or what you're willing to lose).  I personally feel panicky and start to sweat even when I move just a portion of my coins from cold storage to an exchange for trading.  If your account is not secure, you will be pwned.  Use a strong, unique password, maybe even a unique email, and YOU MUST use two factor auth.  Be sure nobody will ever gain access to that email address...
  
None of that matters if your computer has a virus/trojan though.  If you aren't extremely confident that you don't have any viruses...you need to use a different computer.  I suggest using Ubuntu and I personally started using Bitcoin Armory although I'm not in love with it yet.  Be careful buying laptops second hand.  Obviously you gotta do a full wipe, but I am just a paranoid person.  You'll probably be okay if you aren't wanted by the government (:p), but just be careful.
  
Also make sure to read up on "change addresses".  A lot of noobies (myself included at one point--I thought I lost $5k) don't know about this subject.  Basically when you make a transaction, the amount of coins you used to pay for your product go to the seller, but the remainder of your coins (unused) goes to a new change address.  Many bitcoin clients dont make this obvious, so then when you go to your cold storage address you have a heart attack because it's empty!  If you don't have your wallet file, you are effed because your coins are actually sitting at a different location, the change address.  You can export these change addresses out of your client, but just be careful because you may think all your coins are at your cold storage when they have actually moved because you spent some of them.  The only way to gain access to them now would be through your wallet file, since you wouldn't have their keys written down.

So who wants to explain why asymmetric_bet is incorrect rather than being fancy with their words?  I mean, I know it makes you look cool on Reddit and all so maybe you actually have no idea. 
  
This makes sense to me: "It's been already patched on a number of systems. Debian patched it already.  How did they patch it? Bring on additional math that makes the CPU workload non-correlated with any key."  &lt;= Explain why this is false, especially since this is directly quoted from the article in question: "Application-layer, algorithm-specific mitigation, in contrast, prevent the (inevitably) leaked signal from bearing any useful information. It is often cheap and effective"

Exactly this.  People have moved, or are currently moving their funds out of MTGOX.  It's been heading this way for a few months now.  Also, it is just an exchange so don't worry about the market crashing without cross referencing other exchange prices first.  MTGOX is no longer king.

To anyone who is freaked out about losing money...just remind yourself why you boight bitcoins the first place.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

@_date: 2013-12-20 02:47:46
I have a lot to say on this topic but unfortunately I'm on a cellphone.  Altcoins do take some of the market away from bitcoin, but it's not a bad thing unless one is blissfully invested in solely bitcoin.  Some of the bitcoin millionaire entrepreneurs know this, yet fail to understand why this is a good thing since their minds are so absorbed into bitcoin.  There are so many bitcoiners that will downvote anybody even mentioning LTC or PPC, much like fanboys.  I once was similar, immature on the subjects of Altcoins, fearful of the competition they bring.  Now, I understand that the free market will decide.  Intelligent people who are just getting into crypto currencies wont give a f*ck about bitcoin if they feel a different coin is more powerful.  Meanwhile all these BTC fanboys are denouncing Altcoins while forgetting the reality of things.  Yes bitcoin is our first beloved cryptocoin, but there are wolves out there hungry for better future coins.  I personally fear not because I am confident I will see the writing on the walls if ever a more powerful coin pops up...I believe that BTC will never fail from competition, but will eventually compete more closely.  I love the idea of crypto currency in general, and although I'm mainly in BTC...there is much value in other coins.  For example, look at namecoin, it allows one to host a website on the distributed network making it impossible to shutdown.  What if we had a transparent VoteCoin for elections to combat fraud?  As long as there are people on Earth, there will be the creation of more crypto currencies and I will be salivating like a wolf.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:10:03

@_date: 2013-11-19 22:02:07
People are panicky in general.  Just a lot of n00bs that wanted a quick return without understanding the point of bitcoin and with no understanding of virtual currencies in general.  My personal advice is to hold or buy soon, but all these short term speculators and noobies will jostle the price around some more before it settles.  Good news that is currently live:

Maybe 700, 650...but 500, what??, doubt it!!  Lookin more like 1500 by Christmas
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:25:20
I'm thinking 500 max with correction to 300 or 275

I don't really want to get into it for personal reasons.  Basically it happened over the internet...I have a lot of proof, IP's, names, accounts etc of the perp.  Local authorities told me to report to IC3 (Internet Crime Division) and I did---nothing happened.  I called local authorities, FBI in my area and they told me I wasn't getting my money back and nearly laughed at me.  They said it would have to be a much larger amount for them to consider hunting this guy down.  Investigator was total douche.

Yeah...you tried to buy coins with money you didn't have...come on now..
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:32:20
More than 90% of the coins were premined by devs.  Scam, pump n dump...some dude is even getting harassed by the scammers

Got it (it looks similar to all of the past large rises in bitcoin) , in my opinion we definitely have not hit the peak of inflated expectations with bitcoin as a whole.

Excellent.  First off, Mastercoin is built on top of the bitcoin protocol so why is it listed as its own separate currency?  It's also a total ripoff with a bloated design that greatly benefits early investors.  I'm waiting, and salivating, for Colored Coins.   Ripple and NXT...do I really need to go on any further?  I can't believe people buy either of these premined coins.  bitcoin is truly on a different level from these others.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:04:36
Bloated and bad.  Waiting for Colored Coins or better.  This may be profitable in short term but will die by the sword in the coming months.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:36:32
Hmm...I can see the mainstream going with a government backed cryptocurrency and I suppose that would stifle bitcoins growth but not kill it.

Interesting...but I don't think that bitcoin is safe from government meddling.  All they have to do is impose more regulations on exchanges and other markets.  Through the use of tracking identities and their profits through regulation (like MTGOX, campbx, and most legit exchanges do currently) governments can tax users.

This guy says that one entity getting 20%-30% of the network is not possible.  We all know that ASICMiner has already achieved this in the past.   His absolute language proves to me that he is a little too optimistic and not quite as realistic as he should be.  I'm just picking on the details because I've heard the rest, as I generally agree with his arguments.  I just don't think that anything unknown should be considered absolute.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:10:08

I believe that in 2014 there will be a burst in the amount of clearnet and TOR online stores, boosting the economy further.  At this rate we are at now we will hit $3000/BTC by the beginning of 2014.  I think it is good to let other people know about bitcoin, but definitely don't be all up in their face!  We do not want to implode the bitcoin from the inside out, before it has even reached its full potential!

@_date: 2013-11-22 19:05:31
Bitcoin's benefit to consumers besides discounts would be full control of funds with no way for the government to interfere with your bitcoins and print more, devaluing them.
  
Adoption will grow but who's to say it will grow fast enough to justify the price.  Right now I'd say the price is overvalued for THIS moment in adoption but that in the next few months we will be past this point, justifying a higher price.  Community developing exponentially faster.
  
I don't think there is a threat from altcoins, more they will all get along together for different reasons.  For example I could see bitcoin as being used for large purchases and used as an vehicle for long term investment.  Litecoin's faster transaction time (and slight resistance to ASICs) could be utilized in day to day transactions.  Peercoin's protocol allows for the minting of coins based on how long coins are kept in a wallet.  This is perfect for a savings account (at 1%).  Opponents would say "Well bitcoin could just add all of that to their protocol, blagblahblah"...they could or they could not.  I think that fundamentally bitcoin will stay the same.  Only time will tell but I see altcoins sticking around and existing simultaneously.  It is good to have more than one popular coin in case of any unforeseen network emergencies, as well.
  
I think that the newer generations of people that fully understand bitcoin DO have this idea ingrained in their head because bitcoin is so powerful.  Once you fully understand bitcoin and its potential, there is no denying how precious it is an asset.  The newer techy generations understand this technology and will lock bitcoin into place.  It's not a very foreign idea to these people.
  
My question for others: What if the US GOVT came out with a cryptocoin that they officially promote and support?  I'd imagine it would still be made susceptible to quantitative easing...but what if it isn't?  A basic bitcoin copy with some sort of taxing mechanism included?  I think the rest of the world and hardcore bitcoin supporters would stick with bitcoin, but curious on your thoughts.
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:06:47

You never know, man.  I think we will see a rise to $1,500 soon...maybe this next week...but I also can forsee a dip before Christmas where you could buy back in around $960.  If this holds true make sure to buy before Christmas because I would also expect another rally by the closing of the year.  $750-800...I doubt it though it could happen down the line in February/March 2014.

Your best bet is to setup an account on an exchange (not coinbase).  I recommend bitstamp or campbx.  Wire the money directly into the account so you don't pay any fees besides what your bank charges for the wire.  Use an exchange because it will be cheaper than coinbase.  Don't worry, it's your money.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:27:06
It's important to compare the market cap of bitcoin to other corporations and industries because it shows how much money could potentially "move" into bitcoin (and thus away from these industries!).  For example, citibank has a market cap of $154 billion.  The current market cap of bitcoin is $12 billion.  It wouldn't be wise to imagine that the whole market cap of citibank would be absorbed into bitcoin, or anything like that, but it puts things into perspective.  Especially since citibank is just one of many others.  
As far as comparing bitcoins to gold, I think the idea is fun but a time waster.  Gold and bitcoins are a similar species and they share similar ideologies, but they are different animals.

That meme shit ain't takin' lightly around here, mate.  I hope you learned a hard lesson though...buy low and sell high.  It's that simple.  If you sell your position lower it means that your understanding and valuation was not strong enough to be worth the initial investment in the first place.  You need to understand why youre buying and then decide what you are going to do from the get go.  Don't look at the charts 24/7...TIME EXISTS!  Imagine months or years from now...

Open source and crypto is like peanut butter and jelly.  I'm done being tracked, spied on, and sold to.  I actually hope Apple stays firm on this policy so that there is a mass exodus from Apple in a year or two.  I grew up using both Macs and PC's, and own a hackintosh, so I have no bias.
