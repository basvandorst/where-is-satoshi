it'll hit 6k before it hits 12k, sideways is sideways but i predict it will go down
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:07:56
I remember saying it'd make it's way down to 3k back when it was still at 6k and everybody was saying this is it, it's going to go up because capitulation.
I'll say it again. It's going to go down before it goes up, i can see this making it's way down to 6 and if i had the money i'd be shorting
@_date: 2019-11-03 21:56:11
We're not seeing the pressure we need to break through into 10k, I'm guessing price is going to continue to slowly drift down towards 9000 until it breaks down to 8k then again to 7k continuing with the descending trend that we've seen over the past 3 months
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:07:13
The wealth distribution with bitcoin is worse than with any other currency on the planet.
85% of bitcoin has been mined.
How many people own bitcoin? 1% of the population? That would be 70 million?
Well there are only 35m accounts created and let's be generous and say people on average have only ever made two accounts. So 0.25% of the global population wants me to buy into bitcoin of which they already own 85% of?
You know what people will get behind? A new, fairly distributed, level playing field for everybody to start off on equal footing and maybe with some new considerations made with all that we've learnt about crypto and with ideas about new technologies on the horizon

This is horrible advice.
We should not be encouraging people to actively gamble on this sub reddit. 
If you believe imthat bitcoin needs better adoption then this should matter to you to.

People cry when we see a - 30% gain over the span of a month. They pin the blame on fud, governments and whales.
But when the price pumps by 30% in the span of 12 hours there's no questioning the market manipulation behind the price movement. This is quintessential pumping and dumping and it will be a slow bleed out back down to 7k
The only price prediction I've made since we bounced up to 9k 14 days ago.
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:13:57
Such a typical comment for you to make.
I've been predicting prices as low as this for over 3 months now. This is one of my early predictions and not only was it accurate but it was ignored 
["It's been rejected 3 times now at 12k, so it'll head down now to the 10k support high a high chance of going down to 8k pretty fast and if sentiment dies down than we could easily see below 3k. The fact that the 2017 had winning coins across the board and this time the fact that money is just being moved between coins leads me to believe as much"](
I talk in hypothetical because people in this sub live in la-la land most the time. 30k is highly unlikely this year and next. Not only did we not break up above 14k but we'd still have to break up past 20k. 3k probably wont happen this year and i also think 3k is unlikely but bitcoin was 3k only this year so unlike 30k, it's not unrealistic.

Economies do not function without any investment.
Without investment you cannot grow you economy according to the SOLOW model.
Nobody would invest if they couldn't get capital and you will not get capital if the money supply was fixed. It would be impossible to relize an interest yeild.
This is why we have debt, to grow, to invest in future technologies so we don't have to live like cavemen whilst hostile countries with functional economies prosper.
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:42:16
I kinda knew this would happen
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:09:43
Lol, if you think this is anything like 2017 then you're misinformed.
Bitfinex and Tether have an ongoing lawsuit against them for pumping the market price in 2017. They wouldn't get away with it this time.
The October prediction failed
Bakkt didn't increase the price level as predicted
Media hype is nowhere near as big as it was in 2017 .
Also, Christmas is on its way.
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:58:54
The fact its hitting 9k is not a good sign for short term bag holders.
In 2017, the market crashed early December in time for Christmas shopping. There's a real possibility that people will want to liquidate some of their bitcoin to get by the upcomming holiday season and that'll further push price levels down as we saw in 2017.
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:37:10
What's the general consensus on wether or not there is a global recession in the works at the moment, it may be now or just over the horizion, if firms report low sales from the up comming holiday season for example.
Because if we are actually in a recession at the moment then nobodies going to have the spare change lying around to invest in bitcoin. Not the little guys having to dip into their credit to afford Christmas presents this year. Not the big guys who are making less profit this year than they did last year because of slow sales.
So are we going to continue to fall if people cant afford to invest in bitcoin during a recession? because that's been the general trend for the past 4 months. Miners are going to continue to sell coins to the market but nobody is going to be there to buy them. Come the halving, people that could afford 3k last year are struggling with 5k this year. Lots of miners could turn off their machines and the grid would become less secure.
So now might be a good time to sit on the sidelines and wait to see what happens. We can rely on prices staying somewhat stable but we cant rely on stable income, if you don't have a decent emergency fund then your investment in bitcoin could have to be liquidated if that means you get to stay off the streets
@_date: 2019-11-19 08:01:12
We could see sub 8k prices today.
@_date: 2019-11-29 00:19:01
Large players are not immune from recession. They may be investing now but they may stop if their income reduces.
This is known as the income effect and I predict that a slowdown in the global economy will result in a reduction in bitcoin demand.
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:37:33
Hodling is just a shitty attempt of increasing the price of bitcoin via restricting the amount of bitcoin in circulation
@_date: 2019-11-21 10:31:07
Still haven't hit the bottom. We already know that 7500 is a possibility but I think we'll break down farther than that.
If you didn't sell at 14k, or even above 10k then you've missed out on the 2019 bull run in my opinion. Better hope there's one next year
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:36:43
It's just harder to dispute an older, more probable, prediction than a fresh one.
The only reason why I'm not saying it's going down to 7k today is that I said it back when we were at 9.5k
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:20:54
the bots could retract their orders like when we dropped from 8k down to 7.5k a month ago.
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:53:32
It also discourages people who think they know how to trade from capitalising and selling at the top, thereby realising their profits.
It goes both ways. The fact that this hodl mentality is acceptable goes to show that this community doesnt want you to sell because that'll mean the price would drop for them. Its great from a social-engineering, market manipulation perspective. Can an investment firm profit from convincing people to buy bitcoin if theyre wishing to sell a large volume?
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:42:08
I'm talking about wide spread use of bitcoin, in the same way where we replaced our coins with card and how the Chinese replaced their cards with barcode scans from their phone.
Bitcoin can't pay my bills
Bitcoin doesnt have any of the protections of conveniences of a service such as PayPal. Bitcoins open ledger still leaves me vulnerable to privacy invasions. Bitcoin is hard to convert for fiat in some countries having minimum amounts, poor rates and security checks.
This should be the focus. Not hodling.

@_date: 2019-11-18 10:09:24
Honestly cash out now. 
Were technically in the bounce up from 7k and it looks like we'll be heading back. I don't see any indication that we'll break up from this 4 month downtrend any time soon
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:54:00
I think the 3k to 14k price spike kinda came out of nowhere as if it was market manipulation. I would expect to see a steady rise in bitcoin over a long period as real adoption takes time, and changing the way people use their money takes generations.
I think 3k is a pretty safe area, bitcoin held there for a year before breaking up so we would have the 6-8 month downward trend meeting a previous support in conjunction with the 2017 upward trend (the many months it took to go from 1k to 10k before it went exponential) which combined I would say a hard bounce back up to 14k for a possible retest next year in time for the reward halfing.
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:28:39
The daily discussion is an echo box.
Short opinions are always heavily down voted and the comments that follow are typically hostile.
I suggest we remove all talk about prices from and leave it to another subreddit that can instead properly moderate the shitshow that is the daily. My concern is that because this sub-reddit is a gateway into crypto for a lot of new users that there is a risk for the radical viewpoints on the daily chat to start negatively effecting the every day newbie, especially if this subreddit starts to gain popularity again amidst a bull run we'll see nothing but one sided, pro bitcoin ideas dominating the opinion space. In the 2017 bull run. Lots of people got burnt buying in late because they were told it would keep going up, we could possibly say the same about the recent 14k high. lots of people didn't want to sell before 10k and for the entire 3 month period people were in denial about even the potential for bitcoin to go sub 10k again. If people want to seriously discuss investing into a speculative asset such as bitcoin then we should be willing to discuss both viewpoints and the daily we have, in it's current form, is not capable of doing that.
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:06:55

There are not plenty of opinions in this sub.
Reddit is one of the largest websites on the Internet in terms of traffic. The daily discussion democratically decides via up votes what comments get seen and which don't.
Just look at how many up votes my comments have gotten on these posts compared to long predictions. It doesnt matter how wild they are this sub is going to up vote them and I think this is harmful to investors and newbies who get caught up believing in the idea of bitcoin only going up.

@_date: 2019-11-08 12:55:04

Maybe this is a better explanation then
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:05:20
Is bitcoin a store of value?
Let's say hypothetically bitcoin hit 3100 this year or possibly next year. We'd be looking at scenario where every new participant in the crypto market in the past three years will have had lost money. But we're talking about millions of new users. Millions of USD that was exchanged for bitcoin and also mining hardware and electricity that ultimately ended up as loss.
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:04:20
Hash rates will drop as miners leave the network. This could be catastrophic for network security. For example, we have the reward being cut in half shortly, if I'm correct there are 1800 bitcoins mined per day, at 8k this represents 14.5m usd worth of bitcoin entering daily. This will soon become 7.25m per day, if the price dropped to 4k as it was earlier this year that  reward will then be worth 3.6m
Theres a couple things to consider. Because there are less bitcoin entering the market we'd probably see an increase in price levels but this isn't always the case. You also have to account for the decrease in network security as hash rate is reduced and this is important, as other users have mentioned, countries and miners with the cheapest electricity will be able to continue mining at these rates but this would further centralize the network.

Venezuelans also rely on runescape as a primary source of income.
It doesn't HAVE to be bitcoin. it could be the USD for example or just any currency that can hold it's value. I agree that it must be a thousand times easier to transfer bitcoin than USD in a undeveloped country but it doesn't add much value to your currency because they don't have the purchasing power to increase the price of the currency.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:53:09
I've been saying it for months. bitcoin hasn't even hit the bottom yet. i wouldn't be surprised if the bottom was 4k.
sure, we have the lightning network but it means nothing if nobody is using it. Similar concept with google+, it may have been better than facebook but nobody was using it so nobody was willing to make the effort to transition
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:37:57
If the volume of investment is not the same, seen on the volume graphs for btc and the traffic in this sub, you can look anywhere tbh, then why would the price be anywhere near as high?

If we go down to 6k or even 3k do you think we'd ever see 20k+ prices again? I personally don't think so, all the holders like yourself will tire if bitcoin was dipping lower for 2 years straight

lel, already at 6k, still haven't hit the bottom
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:11:10
In a universe with an infinite supply of resources and bitcoin having a limited supply bitcoin must inflate to meet demand, this is if its to be a functional currency you need a way to manage the exponential inflation that occurs with the growth of the world's wealth, this is why we print money because without it a dollar would be worth a burger one day, a TV the next month, a house the next year, a superyaht the next.
  
So don't tell me that bitcoin has a better inflation rate than the dollar, over the last 12 months its already inflated by 60%
  
Also, what happens if tether stops printing money? There'd be no way to sell you bitcoins for an equivalent usd value, then what? Then we see a total market collapse as every tether is converted into bitcoin and every bitcoin convetered into usd as a way to cash out
@_date: 2019-08-08 08:31:28
If bitcoin is a crypto currency than its inflated as the exchange from 1 btc to 1 banana has gone to 1 btc to 1.6 banana this year. Surely that's inflation.

You cannot phase into quantum proofed mining hardware. If we change the algorithm, instantly the old hardware becomes incompatible and the new hardware becomes compatible.

Being able to devide something is not the same as reducing inflation via increasing supply. I and the rest of the world would rather that their purchasing power not deviate too much over the year.
And are you denying that the value and therefore the purchasing of bitcoin has not increased 60% in the last 12 months? Look up the term for inflation, that is exactly what has happened with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:42:56

It's been rejected 3 times now at 12k, so it'll head down now to the 10k support high a high chance of going down to 8k pretty fast and if sentiment dies down than we could easily see below 3k.

It shouldn't be the norm to instantly dismiss any negative viewpoints regarding bitcoin and it's price. That's how you create echo chambers and allow for participants to make poor financial decisions, with that being said, it's impossible to have any reasonable discussion regarding bitcoin in the daily threads because it's so heavily pro-bitcoin biased that having a counterpoint is just downvoted so it can't be seen
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:05:41
Nah, i just go through my post history when i see bitcoin drop to new lows and let everybody know that i was right
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:24:41
The following months will either make or break crypto.
If btc can't break 12k then it'll be dragged down alongside the recession (if it even happens but the writings on the wall) as people start to liquidate their assets once their savings have run out. This isn't just for Americans, China and Britain will also be hit hard and could easily dump the price of btc and result in a market collapse. If this happens then we could no longer rely on btc as a hedge.
On the flip side and I think this is highly unlikely because America is not Venezuela, if bitcoin surges up, which needs to happen very soon as its currently looking bearish, then people will swap their investments for bitcoin to hedge their losses during the recession.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:20:07

You're wrong.
You're comparing technology that has developers that can send updates over the air to a massive consumer base to technology that needs the entire fleet of hardware to be replaced. So even if we can figure out quantum based encryption, chances are, bitcoin is going to be too slow to adopt it because the miners running the network will have to volunteer to make their current fleet of miners obsolete. This transition will also make the network incredibly weak while the transition happens and we become fully reliant on the new infrastructure and miners take older systems off-line for new.
Next, compound encryption with time based authentication methods, flexible algorithms and all of a sudden you have exponential security as layers of security are built ontop of one another. Compare this to bitcoin's fixed and open source methodology where one can engineer software in secret for a quantum computer to solve and once ready start implementing de-encryption with guaranteed success. 
*Take this one step further* **The addresses of bitcoin wallets and the amounts within are open knowledge**. Consider this a list of bounties. The top 10 bitcoin wallets are worth $5,000,000,000 USD. This is a bounty. If it costs less than 5 billion to decrypt 10 addresses then hackers will spend 5 billion to make this happen. In the current financial world it's much easier to hide key pieces of information from the public.
So my concern isn't quantum computers, it's the cumulation of so many technical issues with bitcoin. You can call it FUD and say im living in lala land but once again, this sub likes to turn a blind eye to any actual issues with bitcoin and downvote anybody who has concerns
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:13:55

@_date: 2019-10-24 04:51:22
Hash rate will continue to increase as technology gets better and machines will continue to be commissioned if it makes economic sense, the higher the price the higher the hash rate. However, this doesn't go the other way around. Buyers of bitcoin don't care about how secure the network is and what the hash rate is, rather they care about usability and accessability and beyond a certain point additional miners don't effect this.

18m bitcoin in circulation
17.5m bitcoin classed as dormant
The active market values the 500m of circulating bitcoin at 9000 USD. If half of the dormant bitcoins were added into circulation the price would be 500USD.
So what's worse? the fact that we have so little bitcoin left to mine or that so many bitcoins are being withheld from active circulation causing an artificial shortage?
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:17:29

@_date: 2019-10-26 21:26:14
I'm saying within the next couples months the price will return to 7k and continue to drop due to the 10k rejection that happened yesterday.
Also, when it comes to bitcoin, those multimillionaires don't need to know the future because they can manipulate the price via inflating (printing) stable coins such as tether for use on their markets.
To take it further;
Bitcoin is becoming more and more centalized. Are your mates who used to mine on their computers still mining on their computers or were they lucky enough to get cheap electricity and the capital needed to buy ant miners? Because its getting to the point where bitcoin is becoming owned exclusively by mining pools and the company that can monopolise the mining market via technological innovation could single handedly take ownership of bitcoin.
Also, have you watched the Google quantum video? All of those miners will need to be replaced when bitcoin's core algorithm needs to change to become quantum proof. Who's going to be able to afford the next gen quantum proof miners? Big business. Not me, not you.
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:54:44
Will bitcoin ever be quantum proof? It will require an entirely new algorithm and therefore new hardware to mine bitcoin and I don't see this happening considering how much capital that miners have to invest just for a single asic miner let alone a farm.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:36:43

The other is a volitile asset that consumes an insane amount of power, creates an incredible amount of pollution, exists in a market bubble that's so rife with corruption that most investors would rather not touch. Its one thing for the treasury to print more money but its another for tether to print money amidst a pump. I assure you that the 200b current market valuation of bitcoin is purely because its being held up by tether.

Cash is amazing. It allows for you to pay for services without having access to technology. If the power goes out or you don't have cell activity or you want an instant transaction then cash is a good alternative.
Also cash is good from a liberty standpoint. The government still has fiscal policy control over cash but you as an individual are allowed to store it under you mattress or invest in overseas shares, buy a house or pay for sports betting. It's functional, efficient and reliable.

You're totally wrong. I was predicting 8k bitcoin for two months when it was above 10k for three months. I was told that I didn't know what I was saying. I know a lot of people have made losses buying the peaks and I don't want to see anybody over invest at all time highs or even when it's 14k.

I don't know what you mean by the future is female but I can assure you that im living on the same planet as you. during a recession when people lose their jobs and they have bills to pay they then liquidate their assets to pay for them. Some people won't be able to pay their debts at all so you also see a lot of people selling large assets such cars being repossessed and mortgages undergo foreclosure.
Do you honestly think that bitcoin is going to double, tripple in price? most of the people who are currently buying bitcoin won't be able to afford to buy during a recession, they simply wouldn't have the money for it and if people stop buying bitcoin, what do you think happens to the price?

The machines that run the network will have to transition immediately once the change as been made.

The only quantum proof encryption that i know of uses quantum entanglement, once the state of either qbit is observed the entanglement breaks and the connection between clients stops, a new secure, connection can then be made with a new pair of entangled particles.
I'm not sure how this technology could be used to secure wallets and we already have quantum computers, give them another 5-10 years and i believe that we'll be able to crack bitcoin wallets with them. But we don't have quantum encryption technologies. It's an arms race and the only one with a gun is the quantum computer.
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:00:05
This is one comment that i really vibe with.
Economics in general is currently in uncharted territory atm, a lot of the examples you used are relatively new economics mechanisms and ideas. 
However, assuming that bitcoin will be the solution to our economics problems is only somewhat accurate. Now that we're talking about bitcoin on a macroeconomics level, we get to talk about bitcoin and monetary policy in which there is none. A government loses it's ability to set interest rates and cash rates which effect investment and spending sectors. If the private market becomes entirely dysfunctional then with bitcoin, there is nothing a government can do to recover the economy. We moved away from the gold standard for a reason, it makes more sense to evolve and innovate rather than going back to standards with well known issues.

Once you change the mining algorithm the entire network needs to change as old SHA256 wont be able to solve the new mining algorithm.
Im not sure how much the mining hardware costs but it costs more than bitcoin itself.
All of these changes rely on bitcoin being worth more and more, it's a big old money sink, and in the future the bitcoin rewards will be much lower and i don't think the economics will allow for such a system

These fees are way too high.
because bitcoin doesn't inflate, and as more people enter the market hence demand increases. We'd expect to see bitcoin prices go up as more people adopt bitcoin. So as more people use bitcoin, these fees go up aswell, you don't want to be the guy at the bar who waited two hours for his bitcoin to go through. Sure, you can pay to have it go through quicker but what if it's a chocolate bar at the store? you pay a dollar and you're on your way but with bitcoin, if people actually wanted to use this technology, it'd cost 2.

@_date: 2019-12-03 05:01:47
That's the problem with bitcoin, there is far to much speculation.
However, you'd have to convince me that bitcoin mining is more efficient then having a centralized network but i have facts that suggest otherwise;
"Currently, the tool estimates that Bitcoin is using around seven gigawatts of electricity, equal to 0.21% of the world's supply."
congress released a report stating that;
"The number of Bitcoin transactions may serve as a better indicator—though a flawed one—of the use of Bitcoin as a payment system. This number reveals how many times Bitcoins are transferred between accounts each day, and data indicates the number of transactions is miniscule compared with those of traditional systems. For example,in 2019 through March 12, the Bitcoin system averaged about 310,000 transactions per day globally, a pace that would result in about 113 million transactions per year.74Recall that in the United States alone, more than 144 billion traditional \(nearly 1,275 times as many\) non-cash payments were made in 2015.Moreover, one problem with this measure it that it is a count of how many times two parties have exchanged Bitcoin, not a count of how many times Bitcoin has been used to buy something."](
If bitcoin had the same number of transactions then would it need twice the global energy supply to process the transactions for america which is less than 5% of the global population. So is bitcoin not charging enough for it's transactions? will my $1 chocolate bar bought with fiat cost me $2 to transact in 10 years time through bitcoin due to reduced mining rewards and increased demand?

Take it from a typical, every day person. I see no way bitcoin can make my life better.
I pay for everything with a credit card and get thousands for doing it. I just transfer the payment from my account to the card and never pay interest. I send money via etransfer or direct transfer if they use the same bank.
I've read a lot on here and bitcoin is complicated and unnecessary. People who believe in bitcoin seem to fall into two categories -
1) The belief that the price is basically going to increase forever into astronomical levels and buying bitcoin is basically a get rich quick scheme.
2) The belief that the whole financial system is going to fall apart and people all around the world will choose bitcoin as their currency, then it will become the world's currency. Basically, a doomsday prepper.
I don't believe either will happen. This sub is filled with hilarious nonsense of pumping up bitcoin. The huge price rise in 2017 had a lot of people talking about bitcoin. Basically everyone knows what it is now. Next to nobody actually wants to use it.
The terrifying thing about this sub is that I think a lot of people have been brainwashed and are spending a lot of money investing in bitcoin. They listen to only bitcoin supporters for confirmation bias and truly believe the price can only go up in the long term.
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:26:40


Totally agree. Bitcoin has more users, more hash power, more developers ect.


It's hard to find quality data on actual adoption but congress has the following to say;
["The number of Bitcoin transactions may serve as a better indicator—though a flawed one—of the use of Bitcoin as a payment system. This number reveals how many times Bitcoins are transferred between accounts each day, and data indicates the number of transactions is miniscule compared with those of traditional systems. For example,in 2019 through March 12, the Bitcoin system averaged about 310,000 transactions per day globally, a pace that would result in about 113 million transactions per year.74Recall that in the United States alone, more than 144 billion traditional \(nearly 1,275 times as many\) non-cash payments were made in 2015.Moreover, one problem with this measure it that it is a count of how many times two parties have exchanged Bitcoin, not a count of how many times Bitcoin has been used to buy something."](
Furthermore, the reason why i believe that the masses don't wish to use bitcoin is probably for the same reasons that i don't want to adopt bitcoin;
1. I can't pay my bills in crypto
2. I can't shop through ebay, amazon, ect, in crypto
3. I have to pay high fees in exchange fiat for crypto which, once again, has to be exchanged back in order to be exchanged for goods.
4. I am in control of my own money, if i lose it, if i get hacked, scammed, ect. It's on me. My credit card, paypal, bank has fraud protection in case i get my card stolen or skimmed.
None of this is good for the end consumer. Take a couple steps back to my first post, this is why crypto isn't being adopted. Because it's too much work for such little gain. Maybe if you live in a financially volatile part of the world then being able to transact and move money around is beneficial but relying on entire nations to economically collapse so that bitcoin becomes useful is not productive and is not worth banking your money on. 


Demand has been reducing since 2017 according to the market, we've already retracted by 7k since the 14k high this year and we could see this go further. You say "assuming demand increases" but that's the thing. If demand doesn't increase then bitcoin miners will have to shut up shop and once again, bitcoin mining centralization will increase in areas with cheap electricity and a government such as china's could easily start to take advantage of the network if other countries cannot afford to compete since the democratic systems that determine what changes can be made to bitcoin is only available for miners and miners will only mine when it makes economic sense to do so, for example, in china.
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:10:55
Does bitcoin not have transfer fees? I'm almost certain i've paid them before.
Also, without charge-backs we end up with an increase in hacking and a greater dependency on IT security that the masses are simply not capable of dealing with. This also becomes an issue for exchanges and i can imagine it would be with merchants aswell.
@_date: 2019-12-04 04:46:04
Smart buy around 5k for a short flip as there'll be a bounce up off support, this usually happens when a long downtrend meets an even long up trend and we can assume that i'll bounce up to as high as 12k.
good buy around 3k for a longer flip, will be very bearish at this price points, once again, still have 3k support from this year that'll likely lead to a bounce. Lots of potential to make money at this buy in.
risky sub 2k for a very long flip, will be incredibly bearish if it gets to this point, but if you buy in at 1500 and it dropped to 1300 you'd be 20% down, very long term support is at 3-500 range so you can see where the risk is involved with a buy at this price point. Also huge potential for profit, could easily x10, x20 your money at these prices but i assume that shit has hit the fan for it to get this low

Well the problem with credit cards is more so the interest more than it is what people spend it on.

So is Monero. So how come bitcoin can be worth silly amounts yet other, very similar coins, can't.
Is it because of adoption? probably, but even though bitcoin is the most popular coin almost nobody actually uses bitcoin at the moment and a competitor crypto could easily take market cap away from bitcoin if it could figure out how to be more widely adopted.
Is it because of the underlying technology and code? Possibly, however, it's open sourced, easy to replicate and other coins such as monero are actually better on paper than bitcoin.
Is it because of the number of miners and overall network performance? Possibly, but i'd argue that we're seeing an increase in centralization with regard to bitcoin mining with most mining being done in china, a communist country which could strong arm miners if it meant that they could use bitcoin to further their own goals. Also, as the price continues to fall and the halving date looms closer we're likely to see a strain on the network of miners so we could see centralization and the probability of a 51% attack increase.
Is it because it's over valued? most certainly.

Governments have banned goods before, we can see that they don't work but bitcoin is a currency. Its nothing but a form of exchange and that becomes useless when you cant spend it on the things you need. That's already one of the adoption problems that were facing, fiat is just too convenient for most people. Prohibition currency will be inconvenient and therefore less practical unlike other prohibition goods.

It's can't just go sideways out of a pennant, especially a pennant that's been forming for three months and went from 3k to 13k, if anything, this is just a market correction and the price will drop to reflect what the market thinks bitcoin is worth
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:59:05
Where are you getting that stat for new buyers? As far as I'm aware, public interest in bitcoin is still lower than it was in 2017 and if there are that many new buyers than its probably people who buy and sell bitcoin within the same working day as part of a transaction instead of an investment and although these kinds of transactions drive volume they do not effect the price as the merchant has fiat bills to pay and needs to liquidate their bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:35:49
You've spent the entire day calling people names buddy and you're clearly not interested in actually having an intelligent discussion about the price movement or bitcoin so why are you here?
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:04:08
If bitcoin went to 0 I would buy sooooo much of it
@_date: 2019-09-15 21:16:56
This could easily go down to 8k and this could be the last time youd be able to sell for above 10k. I don't know why you would buy at 12k when there were lots of opportunities to buy lower, even at the 9.5k dip you'd be up by 10% atm.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:32:20
Isn't an accurate prediction the most positive comment one can make? Because if true I've helped educate those who've listened, if correct I'd be helping people from buying high or over investing
@_date: 2019-09-18 14:12:37
A lot of government employees for example get paid with printed money
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:59:25
We're getting very close to the drop to 8k.
This will drop below 10k and when it does there's a very high likely hood for it to hit the 9400 support. From there it can jump up to 10200 or drop down to 8k
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:49:38
No, it is not. At the moment bitcoin is finilizing on a descending triangle pattern, if it doesn't break up to atleast 11k in the next month then we will certainly fall back down to 8k.
Now you can down vote me because I'm not pro bitcoin but I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible and just trying to draw conclusions from almost 3 months of trends.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:31:36
We don't normally get back to back downtrends, you're right, instead what we get are oscillations, in TA these are your pennants, triangles and wedges.
We're still waiting to see what the next signal is but i do think that the next run will see a lower high than the previous 13k and you get that resistance level from charting off the 2017 high and the 2019 high.
However, where is the long term support? if we trend support over the past 3 years i can't imagine it would be far off 5k.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:12:35
if it's going to break down to 8k it's probably going to retract a lot further than that
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:11:41


*when bitcoin drops below 10k*
- "you didn't call shit"
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:57:35
I'd say crypto is fucked in general. Lots of people have been burned from IPOs, lost wallets and bad trades so the general population is unwilling to make the switch to crypto
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:52:43
It's all good, when it does crash i'll be sure to send you a message with my next prediction so that can have another chance to make some money for yourself
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:08:03


So when i asked you what the limit of complexity is and you gave back and an answer you lied?
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:22:38
Bitcoin is moving very slowly so to say that it hasn't hit the support yet and therefore i'm wrong is dead wrong. Knowing that bitcoin was at 10200 when i made my call the fact that it bounced off 9600 when my call was 9400 prediction means that **my prediction was far more accurate than most people's prediction in this sub**. I also think it's pretty unfair to criticize my predictions so harshly when nobody else is even getting theirs close.
@_date: 2019-09-29 10:55:58
Welcome to the bitcoin daily discussion where we don't like having actual discussion about bitcoin, especially if they're uneducated about bitcoin. Instead we like to talk down on our newer members yet complain because the price is going down and nobody wants to buy into the market.
Stay classy @_date: 2019-09-24 21:21:49
This could definitely be the signal of a long term downward trend so while 7200 and 6800 aren't likely in the next month or so we could still see it drop down
@_date: 2019-09-16 23:59:00
"it hasn't dropped below its bottom since it formed"
Thats why we have a 3 month descending triangle, it did drop out of the pennant tho.
  
You can say what you want about the price and the underlying technology but saying the TA is inaccurate just because the price is *respecting* the trend makes no sense.

Throwing the book at somebody is not answering the question and it's a horrible way to have discussions. He's asked a very valid question that I don't think anybody in this sub could possibly answer. For example, what is the limit of complexity that the mining algorithm can produce? Because an infinitely hard question would be infinitely long and take an infinity to compute so therefore it could be impossible to mine.
If there is a limit to complexity and no limit to processing power than there is also a theoretical, near instant solve time.
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:55:10
Looks like the pennant is closing. Within the next month we'll know if we retest 13k or continue back down to 8k
I believe we will head back down to 8k, looking at the overall crypto market cap, the last time bitcoin hit support at $9500 on August 29th, the market cap hit its lowest point in almost three months. The next time we hit support we could see this dip even further. If this happens near the end of the pennant pattern this could indicate a bear signal at the same time that the market is trying to figure out if it wants to head to retest 13k or break back down to 8k
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:09:37
It's also important to keep an eye on total market cap as that will indicate if the cryptomarket is being invested into or cashed out of. We're still trailing down with no indication that there's a large amount of new money entering the space
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:46:38
Everybody whos been paying high fees and buying at at a high over the past three months has now made a loss.
You can spin it anyways you want but that investment has an opportunity cost and the idea that "we don't care about our entry point because we simply care about accumulation" disregards the fact that you would have been better selling and buying at a later stage or even better off buying at a good entry point not a annual high
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:26:08
Called it
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:27:10
So downward predictions make me a dickhead?


So are we trying to create useful discussion or are we just trying to make an echo chamber here? because if this sub doesn't want to hear both sides of the story then the people here need to stop bitching when the price goes down instead of blaming bank shills, whales, IPO scammers, ect
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:18:50
People said the same when bitcoin fell from 20k to 18k, it might not be the peak but its better than sinking with the ship.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:19:40
we experienced exponential growth with classical computers whilst moore's law was relevant. If this was still happening we would have the exponential growth of the complexity matched with the exponential growth in processing power leading to a linear complexity progression. Since moore's law is no longer relevant we end up with a calculation that is almost impossible to solve since it will take an unrealistic amount of time to compute or get to the point where we are able to compute it. 
The fact that bitcoin has a finite complexity means that it will be obselete one day, however, if we experience double exponential growth in the rate of computing power then the 'one day' becomes very soon as the rate of change in complexity cannot keep up with the growth in computers.
Without moore's law, as time increases the difficulty is similar to f(x) = x^2
With moores law, exponential growth is met with exponential growth and we would accurately be able to estimate when we would reach the maximum conplexity. f(x) = x^1
With quantum computers the complexity would not scale with the growth and it would look similar to f(x) = x^-1
@_date: 2019-09-16 00:28:22
When I called 3k people said the same about it being impossible to go below 6k.
So far we have a 3 month descending triangle which indicates that shortly we'll break down to 8k, now I understand that TA is not always accurate but for it to even break up to 12k would invalidate the current trend.
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:50:55
This is it, everybody expected that the dump had run out of steam at 6k then it dropped to 3k.
Everybody holding would sell at an instant if they knew the price was going to drop, its not about dumpers and whales it's about being able to use trends to predict far enough into the future that you get a good balance of both accuracy and reliability, ie, TA and the TA is not looking so hot right now
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:19:51
This is reasonable and is why some firms chose to break their stock down into smaller shares so that people can purchase a whole share at a lower price
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:07:12
I've said it over and over again and it just gets down voted. Now I just say it's going down to 8k and it's up to others to do their own research.
However, there is one thing I need to make clear. long term trends predict long term outcomes
Over the past 3 months we've gone from a bullish pendant to a bearish descending triangle. I'm not the only one who's seeing this pattern either, we have lot of users comment on the current descending triangle yet people are more concerned about the daily price trends and "when moon" than they are about the high likely hood that were going to see the descending triangle finalise into a drop to 8k.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:25:42
I'm not pretending to be a trader, I'm simply just a guy doing his research and forming an opinion from that.
Also, [alanmasters]( and [vaidoveek]( have made similar predictions to mine so i can't be that shit at TA
@_date: 2019-09-29 10:45:58
You'd be changing the underlying foundation of algorithms that bitcoin uses to keep wallets secure and to authenticate transactions and if you do that you need to replace all of your asic miners as well so you'd ruin the hash rate and ruin the environment as well
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:42:44
Looks like bitcoin is regularly pumped and dumped
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:11:01
This is the problem with bitcoin.
  
You want mass adoption but the mass doesnt want the responsibility of securing their money
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:59:38
What makes you think it's the miners dumping btc? The miners probably have very little to do with the short term fluctuations that bitcoin is known for, instead it's probably whales and large investors who are gaming the market
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:51:13
Well this isn't really a dump. The dump that happens on August 29th is one is however and I think the next time we see a dump we may see the price break down further as the descending triangle trend that has been forming over the past three months finalises
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:17:06
If it goes to 0 it will be known as the most sophisticated pump and dump ever
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:10:58
We're going to 8k
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:01:42
Selling yesterday would have been a good time. Likely to bounce back up to 10100 but there's a very high likely hood that it'll dip much further.
  
I think selling now is better than selling before a breakdown is confirmed.
  
Buying atm is very risky, you're banking on the fact that bitcoin is going to break up and the TA suggests otherwise
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:56:57
should be within the next month ± 2 weeks
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:32:01
Could take months, years even to hit 13k again, same with 8, this could be the last time it's 8k till 2021. the idea that the next moon is just around the corner is what prevents people from cashing out on their positions and ultimately ends up in people taking bigger losses than they had hoped for
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:36:27
24 hours ago would have been a pretty prime time to sell my friend, it's a shame that the TA is right this time
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:26:18
The market needs a breather. It didn't go from 20k to 6k overnight, there were multiple tests before it made its way there. In the meantime, let the dust settle. It could totally drop to those values within the next month, actually, I think we will see 7k within the next month but I think we'll go sideways or bounce over the next 48 hours before we see any further signals on where the market is going
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:19:50
Russia and China could definitely use it to bring down the west
