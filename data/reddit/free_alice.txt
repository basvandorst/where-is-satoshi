1. Go to  and download the Zip file linked at the bottom
2. Unpack the Zip file and verify the SHA256-sum of the file bitaddress.org.html, on Linux that would be:
    $ sha256sum bitaddress.org.html     
    2c5d16dbcde600147162172090d940fd9646981b7d751d9bddfc5ef383f89308  bitaddress.org.html
3. Copy that file to an USB-Stick, all other files are not needed
4. Boot offline on a trusted computer, e.g. from some Linux live distro
5. Plug in the USB-Stick and open the file bitadress.org.html in a Web browser
6. Print generated paper wallet and turn computer off. Many printers just work if you plug them in.

There is also a Bitcoin testnet and testnet wallets, e.g. [1]( [2]( if you just want to play around a little bit without fear of losses.

You can do this in any Web browser on any OS, just open  and print the generated wallet. But you should consider the risks, a desktop environment which was on the internet at some point in time is considered vulnerable in general.
EDIT: Also, some printers have a persistent memory, I wouldn't print my paper wallet on a shared printer.

If OP had a low volume market I think nobody would really care whether he pays taxes or not (except maybe his competitors). And, a farmers market is not really anonymous IMHO, I guess you can normally find out the name of a seller on such a market if he sells bad products.

Create a new backup if your actual wallet stores more keys than its backup. A Bitcoin-qt wallet has pre-generated 100 key pairs by default. E.g. if you have a backup of your initial wallet but your actual wallet stores moren then 100 adresses you need to make a new backup. This page has more details:

Bitcoin is a worldwide currency. And it's decentralized. Outlawing Bitcoins must be very difficult. If the US goverment outlaws Bitcoin trading then people will quickly figure out how to bypass this law. Why? Because there is a demand for digital cash.

I would like to see "online shopping proxies". Problem: I live in country A and want to buy something from an online shop in country B, I have Bitcoins but the shop doesn't accept Bitcoins and/or doesn't ship to my country. Solution: I order at the original shop and set the proxys address as shipping adress. I pay the proxy with Bitcoins (using a 3rd party escrow service or a multisig transaction) and the proxy pays the original shop with the local currency. Then the proxy ships the item to my adress. The devil is in the details though.

"The Mint ran a challenge during the summer of 2012 to develop apps and ideas for how MintChip could be used. The prizes included $50,000 in gold bullion.[4] Winners included a wallet app for Windows Phone 7, an app to donate micropayments to charity with every transaction you perform, and a mobile checkout/point of sale app.
The challenge also had a public voting component for the ideas section. The top 25 ideas would then be narrowed down to top 10 by a panel of judges. This part of the challenge attracted controversy, as the idea "**MintChip can be used to buy Bitcoins**" won the vote by a large margin but did not make it into the final top 10."
