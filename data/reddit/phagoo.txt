Hi, Sorry about that, I am not here to form a discussion on anything, just my own thoughts of how I'm viewing everything.
I am extremely grateful for Bitcoin and the people that surrounded it, and did my due diligence and read and read and read from both sides, because that's what I do when I love something, and I believe we all do. 
I take it all in and form my own decisions from it.

If blocksize is limited, then the demand for sidechains increases, I think that's pretty obvious to see for everyone.

This is the state of this sub, summed up in a video.

Bitcoin was meant to be more than money and gold.
Bitcoin is a means for people to transact with each other with no third parties involved.
I'm willing to learn and listen to anyone in the space, rather than just ignore it because of what someone else told me.

"Such economy would totally slow down the progress. On the bright side people would be wealthier and more wary to spend. But I lack of economical knowledge to assert whether it is a good thing or a bad thing."
I don't think  it's bad at all, I think it would be amazing.
Here's why I think so, the economy would fight for your hard earned bitcoins, by competition, companies would deliver better quality products to you.
The only "bad" thing I would think is, that this competition among  businesses , would take marketing on a whole other level.

It's easy to point fingers, but not get angry at the people that told you who to point your fingers at.

Bitcoin can be both, a store of value and a means of exchange. If adoption, merchant acceptance increases and products are denominated in satoshis or in Fiat. The fact that it's deflationary is what money should be like, right.?
Allot of people in the third world, hedge in fiat currencies like usd, because they believe it would retain or even gain the same purchasing power it had at the time of buying it.
Spending would be looked at more frugally depending on how much bitcoin one has. The other thing is would you keep your bitcoins and not spend it, or starve.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:00:09
Why is it non-viable as a currency, today?
Highly speculated on, High fees, less marketing and merchant adoption.
Don't see it as a perspective we have what a currency is, which is inflationary, meaning printing more of it at any giving time. Why would you inflate a currency?
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:53:14
For questionable needs, you would spend your bitcoins on quality things, that have a long lifespan, and that's where competition of businesses,corporations,government comes in. 
They would sell you things that actually benefit you, because you have the power.

The bitcoin.com 
Wallet works perfectly fine, it accepts both bitcoin core and bitcoincash.

Where are the lies, distortions and context dropping? Please provide evidence before you insinuate things like that just because you disagree with it, it's what it is and what you perceive it is.

"A patent allows the patent holder to stop others from building his invention. A license is an agreement between two parties. The licensor allows the licensee to do something (use the software, build an invention). For example, a patent holder may license his patents to others so they can practice his invention."
Change to license.
We'll see.

Read this.
Adam Back, Blockstream’s “President,” strongly advocated yesterday against an almost identical agreement to the one he himself signed both as individual at times and as Blockstream’s President back in 2015. *The “president” says:
“It’s surprising that a few company folks don’t see that meeting in a hotel room to impose a change on Bitcoin would be controversial to users and the ecosystem.”*
Indeed. On or around February 20th 2016 Adam Back, many miners, Bitcoin Core developers and some China based businesses, which at the time handled some 90% of trading volumes,  agreed in a closed door meeting with no journalists present to, among other things:
“Run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core,” and to “only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production.”
Adam Back is now saying that an almost identical agreement to the one he signed both as an individual and as “president” at different times is actually only supported by “a couple of CEOs,” by which he presumably means only two CEOs, with he himself not counting of course so being a “president.”
He further implies that an almost identical agreement to the one he signed would centralize bitcoin to the point where the mighty government might decide to round up all these CEOs and send them to prison because suddenly bitcoin can upgrade. He says:
“We are stronger together, peer to peer and without an identifiable leader who can be coerced, shutdown, etc. This is why the european union banking policy makers say “bitcoin can not be shutdown.”

Apparently this sub does have a long history of people calling out on their shit, as per your words, but when certain people get called out, comments, threads and users get deleted and banned, so you have that. steer the course, too late to change now.

No, just a discussion/rant of "you" along with others, about acquiring dogs(licenses) to protect you from "attackers"(everyone under the sun). In many places dogs are strays.

That's why I encourage every one, that's unsure about what to believe, do your research, it's for your own benefit in this shitstorm, Read, read and read. You'll end up knowing more and make your decisions accordingly.
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:24:12
You're very good at wording your sentences. 
For example: "There have been some very informal discussions around things like adopting a licenses which says that if you distribute a modified version it must either". 
I don't know much about patents, but I know they take a long time to pass through. you bringing this up, nearing November is very worrisome, and I wouldn't be surprised if patents do end up appearing before that time, and not the least surprised.

If the majority hash rate moves to 2X. It's bad either way, no matter how many nodes you have. True, Getting stuck with &lt;10% hash power, would be bad. 
Edit: Unfortunately "consensus" ("users/ core ") doesn't think so.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:40:51
So anyone and everyone who disagrees with core developers is bad?
Common guys this is getting out of hand, really.
Do your own research, base your judgement on what YOU think it is, not of what other people think it is. Bitcoin represents everyone and is made for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:14:37
Nodes &gt; Miners, here. Maybe OP typo'd?
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:13:44
"(e.g. nchain claiming they are patenting bitcoin and will only license their patents to bcash users)" kind of contradicting yourself there.
I saw the presentation, and I'm sure that there were no mentions of patenting bitcoin itself , but patent the tech built on top of it, because they spent R&amp;D on it and can license it to whoever they want. 
Bitcoin cannot be patented it's free for everyone and anyone to fork and use. By using the state you completely cast aside the very foundation of bitcoin.

Awesome write up, thanks for taking the time to respond. 
This is my main concern, about the relation of Blockstream and The BitcoinCore project. 
A company that's focused on bitcoin developement and specifically sidechains. Where the The company that hired Gregory Maxwell and Adam Back, is also part of the opensource developement of the Bitcoincore project.
In all honesty don't you believe that some kind of control of what happens takes place? 
The quote you mentioned is also interesting, because imho doesn't really describe an actual opensource project. For example, I as a company want's X, and I want it built, I'm hiring the guys that can make it a reality and they can bring in whoever they think would help make it a reality if it's within the budget.
This quote, 
"There's lots of really cool things going on. And often in the bitcoin space people are looking for the bitcoin developers to set a roadmap for what's going to happen. But the bitcoin project is an open collaboration, and it's hard to do anything that's like a roadmap.
I have a quote from Andrew Morton about the Linux kernel developers, which I'd like to read, where he says: "Instead of a roadmap, there are technical guidelines. Instead of a central resource allocation, there are persons and companies who all have a stake in the further development of the Linux kernel, quite independently from one another: People like Linus Torvalds and I don’t plan the kernel evolution. We don’t sit there and think up the roadmap for the next two years, then assign resources to the various new features. That's because we don’t have any resources. The resources are all owned by the various corporations who use and contribute to Linux, as well as by the various independent contributors out there. It's those people who own the resources who decide."
It's the same kind of thing that also applies to bitcoin. What's going to happen in bitcoin development? The real answer to that is another question: what are you going to make happen in bitcoin development? Every person involved has a stake in making it better and contributing. Nobody can really tell you what's going to happen for sure. But I can certainly talk about what I know people are working on and what I know other people are working on, which might seem like a great magic trick of prediction but it's really not I promise."
The people that own the resources that decide, The same kind of thing that also applies to bitcoin.
How is this opensource though? 
From the bitcoincore.org website. 
"*The Bitcoin Core project has a large open source developer community with many casual contributors to the codebase. There are many more who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation.*"
From the Blockstream wiki:
"*Blockstream is a blockchain technology company co-founded by Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Austin Hill and others, and led by Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell. Blockstream is one of a number of institutions that provide funding for the development of Bitcoin Core, the predominant network client software.*"

It's backed by it's scarcity(21 million supply) and the Work(POW+Electricity)put into getting(mining) bitcoin by hashing (solving cryptographic math equations). Parties that put in the work follow the same rules.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:03:53
The problem started 2 years ago, and is likely to continue, keeping onchain transactions high and conformations long, while moving to 2 layer solutions which have newer and undiscovered attack vectors.
Some devs even mentioned that high fees on bitcoin is actually a good thin for bitcoin. 
In my opinion, It's saddening.

They will move to bitcoin, and create payment hubs, most likely requiring kyc/aml, in order to use it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:53:44
OP, It says nothing about majority of the hash power, smh. 
You know that the nodes the whitepaper is referring to are nodes that mine and validate blocks right? Not the ones that only validate blocks.
