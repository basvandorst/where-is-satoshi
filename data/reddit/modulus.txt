It's good in some parts. Expensive, but no caps, and fast. 100mbis with no traffic caps and no bullshit port blocking isn't bad.

In this discussion, nuttiness has no impact on the posterior probability of nuts believing utter nonsense that has fuckall to do with truth.

The only intuitive interface is the nipple. All else is learned.

I think the only people I've seen with good solutions for this problem (not for Bitcoin specifically, but more generally) are the Tezos project. Of course it is vapour and white papers at the moment, but they have thought of ways of abstracting these problems and using similar mechanisms to assess consensus and handle change. Whether it works or not remains to be seen.

Given that I don't have the right to vote for this election and I can't affect the outcome, I'll give this a shot. At least if Trump wins I'll get 0.01 BTC while the world burns:

A little curious how this is supposed to go in terms of property registry. In order to access the registry the act must be notarised. In order to be notarised, the money must be exchanged in situ in front of the notary. I get the feeling it would take a pretty clued up notary to attest to such a thing.

I've been using core as a wallet for ages. Maybe not the most ergonomic, but perfectly usable from the CLI.

I did a few searches and it seemed to be the most recommended exchange. That said I'm getting verified on Kraken now. It seems considerably easier.

I'll give Kraken a shot then.

Possibly in the US, the issue is I'm in the EU.


I could get someone to help to upload the ID, which wouldn't require giving them my password or anything. Unfortunately this is not a very practical solution for a number of reasons...
I may try contacting Coinbase, but I was hoping there would be some other service which wouldn't require me to take photos of the ID like that. I don't understand why they don't take scans.

Slightly amused that you reply to someone complaining of historical inaccuracy while peddling your own:

Hah! I never thought of doing that! They do say that they don't accept scanned pictures, but I suppose they make limited efforts to stop you from submitting them.

What pisses me off about verification is not giving MT Gox my personal data. That's mildly annoying, but perfectly tolerable. What pisses me off is having to get fucking *notarised translations* for all my documentation because Mt Gox don't feel like hiring non-English speakers to deal with this. It imposes a pretty high burden given the cost of accredited translation.
