Spending is the next step - a big reason it took so long was finding a manufacturer that could switch to smart chips whenever we were ready for them.  I’m working on a Point of Sale system for the cards, but it’s slow going. Mostly working with other tech at the moment, as BTC tech is a little slow for point of sales.

Thank you!

Originally, Public Address was there because Private Key was stored on the rear face, and later on a separate card. For now, we don’t support private keys due to security and cost.
You think just the logo + QR will be good?

I'll see if that's something I can do! Right now I have this card and others for sale, but nothing like that.

It's just your public QR code on a card, you can scan using a wallet app to instantly get someone else's address to send payments.

Going to copy/paste from another reply: 
Getting these printed with unique QR codes on each is actually pretty logistically difficult - most places with the capability to print them are looking for batches of 100+, so each card was looking to be something like $18 at first.
Additionally, I wanted to find a manufacturer that supports smart chips in the cards for a POS system I’m working on.
The basic card itself didn’t take that long, the infrastructure to create them and scale with better technology is what took so long.

With a total of $2 profit per card, after taxes and fees I make about $0.70 a card.  
Real profit machine, this one.

Thank you.

It's essentially a card with your public QR on it.  
I have paper wallet versions as well, but the cost to print two cards is pretty hefty, and I don't want to have the public and private key on the same card.

We actually accept Bitcoin right now!

Nice username.

I’m actually working on a gift card right now and that is my main problem. I want to create a trust less system but so far, it’s impossible.
I don’t actually store private OR public addresses, they’re destroyed immediately after printing. But that of course requires trust.

After you enter your shipping details and select your shipping method, you can select Coinbase Commerce here:

You just input your public address and that is printed - I don’t want your private key haha

Cryptotex.net, I only have a few types of cards at the moment.

Tangibility is important to many people.
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:04:34
Because it’s very high quality printing, not just putting laminate over a plastic card.

It’s roughly $7 per card cost for me, I’m not at my computer right now but if you PM me I’ll get back to you ASAP

When I’m able, I’ll make a mock-up and post it here with nothing else on it. A few hours maybe, tomorrow latest.

This is the size of your typical credit card - you don’t really want to carry it on a keychain.
