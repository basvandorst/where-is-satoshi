Obama, clinton, and the bushes (george jeb) all hid illegal campaign contributions as im sure many in the senate and house have google it, also china hacked trumps phone is another theory.. not proven

Its been noted that Trump doesn’t really use email. Knowing that how is WL going to leak Trumps taxes when he files them in paper to the IRS? You are just like a Rachel Maddow/ Ezra Klein democrat who starts at a conclusion then uses conjecture to try to prove a shakey conspiracy.

How hard is it to google Obama campaign finance fraud?

Allot this is true  about the GOP sure, but what does trump not using email have to do with his unsecure phone usage. HE DOESNT USE EMAIL, jesus christ dude simmer down you have no fucking clue what the GOP (not the trump campaign) is doing behind the scenes, all major campaign are fraught with coverups and illegal contributions. Its not an excuse and im not a trump supporter in any way. However again you prove to start at a conclusion with your CONSPIRACY THEORY ( its not a demeaning term to me its just what you are presenting here) you dont have all the info,non of us do, stop acting so high and mighty

How do you not get that there is likely less paper trail to leak because trump doesn’t use email?? Illegal contributions to campaigns are 100% an issue and have been for a while , are you retarded sir?
