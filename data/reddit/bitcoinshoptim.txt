Your comments are well acknowledged and appreciated! We've received offers from graphic designers referencing this very thread and are excited to see what they may have in mind regarding our appearance and sleekness. I'm thrilled by the response of the community - second-to-none in my mind.
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:20:33
We do not yet offer international shipping. However, please know that we are preparing to offer this option in the near future. Your wise suggestion of some additional PC hardware is duly noted, and well appreciated!

Hi Th3Harbringer! Please shoot me an email at tim to see if I can help. 
In general, as long as you have some sort of wallet on your computer, you can use the BitPay interface visible in the checkout. But, if that doesn't work out, I can send you a wallet ID that you can use directly however you like for your transaction. I'll also send a 10% off coupon for your troubles. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:35:19
That is something I was not aware of, and will be fixed immediately. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. We do intend to offer a high level of security, and will pursue consultation to that effect. Thank you for your valuable feedback!
@_date: 2013-09-13 02:18:07
Consider them added to the list of products we'll try to sell. Stay tuned! Thank you for your input, gleapsite!

Late response, sorry! But, you're not missing anything! We want to offer competitive prices and so source inventory from a variety of suppliers. As bachOne notices, it may not always be the case, but we do work to make them competitive across the board. Please let me know if any products seem more expensive than they should be, and we'll be happy to adjust. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:01:55
Thanks for that observation! We try to aggressively match retail prices on all products, regardless of price. We'll review our prices and adjust to make them more competitive across the board. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:14:18
You've given me an excellent list of products to try and offer on our site. Thank you! We want to focus on offering products the community wants, so we especially value feedback like this. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:59:06
PM replied! Enjoy and thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:41:50
Rest assured, that is something I'm hearing loud and clear. We are actively working towards it, and we will offer it the very moment we can assure customers a reliable shipping option no matter where they are on planet Earth. Thanks for your comments!

@_date: 2013-09-12 20:05:05
Well, now, that doesn't belong there!  
Categorization is definitely something we need to work on better, so we'll do a lot of tweaking in that area. I appreciate your feedback - we'll be sure to get it fixed.
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:03:52
You raise a very fair point, and that is something that we will need to improve on ASAP. Thanks for taking a look! 
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:12:52
We will certainly be more than happy to look into offering that and the H4n per your inquiry! Global shipping is something that we are actively looking into, and expect to be able to offer soon. Hang tight!
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:44:59
I'm seeing a resounding opinion on this matter. We aimed to demonstrate that we seek to be philanthropic, in addition to providing a service to the Bitcoin community, but we should not force a customer's hand in providing a donation to a foundation they may not support. The community's input is worth its weight in gold to myself and my co-founder, and I sincerely thank you for your comments! We will reconsider this policy immediately.
EDIT: We now offer donations to the Bitcoin Foundation as an option to our customers, and have removed the ad implying the compulsory donation. Donate as you see fit, or not at all, it's now entirely your choice!
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:38:17
Excellent suggestion, and I couldn't agree more. We'll stock up on as many modern board games as we can - check back in just a few days.
Let me know if you have any particularly in mind!
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:12:57
I'm so happy you had a positive experience! If you feel there are any ways we can improve, please don't hesitate to let me know. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 17:52:28
Hi! This is Tim from BitcoinShop.US. Long time reddit lurker, and I'm psyched that our site found its way to r/bitcoin!
Indeed, there are other Bitcoin-accepting stores already out there, but we hope to offer some stiff competition in the form of free shipping, a massive product catalog, and excellent customer service. 
Feel free to PM me for a coupon code for 10% off your total, if you'd like to give us a shot! 
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:58:18
Agreed, that's something we should definitely carry. We'll put it up as soon as we can, likely by the weekend. Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:15:45
Please let me know if there are any other models of 3D printers we can try to add to our catalog. I agree - the combination of Bitcoin and 3D printing heralds a bright future of empowering technology.
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:00:53
You got it! We'll work on getting it in before the weekend. It looks pretty good, and I love co-op board games, I'll have to try it out at game night!
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:07:59
Agreed. It was my assumption that this was already the case. This issue is now top priority for us. Thank you kindly for your input!
@_date: 2013-09-13 04:15:24
Excellent, thank you for suggesting these! I admit I'm still new to the world of 3D printing, and I hadn't heard of these yet, though they sound familiar - I recall a Kickstarter campaign. We'll look into stocking these right away. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:02:43
Just wanted to say congrats on the great website!
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:28:40
Perspective like this is why I'm very happy to have the chance to interact with r/bitcoin. The very last thing we want is to surprise our customers. Given your input, we are now going to rethink our approach to determine a better way to handle pricing to avoid future inconvenience. I cannot thank you enough for your feedback, and I hope you can give us a second chance as we evolve our store into one the community can be proud of.
@_date: 2013-09-13 02:58:15
It is regrettable that our emails included plaintext passwords, and I appreciate this being pointed out. This has been fixed, and we plan to review our security protocols with professional consultation, keeping our customer's security at the foremost of our priorities. We are committed to the values declared in our tag line, and will work to ensure we maintain them, and correct any deficiencies with the urgency that they undoubtedly require.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:20:14
Yes, unfortunately. If there are any other inexpensive sources for a Playstation 4, we'd be very grateful to know. All of the suppliers we have relationships are bone dry.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:31:36
We're working on lowering prices, and are effectively at zero-margin now. It's the nature of such a heavily-requested item - most everyone's sold out, so the few that aren't can charge a bit more.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:36:15
You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not acting sooner. I've updated all of our S3s to match Amazon's price. It's unfortunate we cannot offer warranties, but that is the reality of our supply at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:18:31
Next time there are items you may need, please let us know, and we will stock them as soon as absolutely possible. My apologies for not carrying the items you were looking for, but we will enhance our inventory of cycling accessories based on your comments, so look forward to an enhanced inventory the next time you visit BitcoinShop.US.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:39:03
We're excited too! 
PM me for a 10% coupon which would stack on our Black Friday coupon for a 20% off total @ bitcoinshop.us! Woo!
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:01:49
I apologize for the inconvenience. We will look into and correct this issue immediately.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:20:05
Totally agreed, which is why we do exactly that!  
We update the prices every 15 minutes according to the respective values of BTC to USD using the Bitcoincharts API.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:11:44
PM replied! Enjoy!
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:56:15
Apologies for the blatant advertising, but take a look at any of 100,000 products we have at bitcoinshop.us! PM me for a 10% coupon, too, if you like! Hopefully it makes your shopping a lot easier. :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:35:41
Hi zottower!
Please take a gander at our offering here:
Prices are a little bit high given the huge demand, but email (tim or PM me for a 10% coupon, which stacks on top of our Black Friday coupon. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:02:24
We offer the option to donate as much as you would like to a list of (currently) 8 charities. We will likely add the Bitcoin Foundation to this list, offering users more of a choice in the matter, allowing them to provide as much financial assistance as they see fit. Your input is appreciated! If there are any additional charities we may add, please let me know!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:54:47
I'd like to respond just to put information out there. 
Our dot US domain was a choice at the height of the bad reputation bitcoin was getting due to the Silk Road and its ilk. We wanted to inject some sense of national legitimacy to bitcoin to try and derail any bad sentiment the US government may have had. It obviously wouldn't end bitcoin if the feds set out to destroy it, but it wouldn't help us, either. We're negotiating to obtain the proper TLDs now that we've achieved a large base of happy customers, and due to our goal to offer our service to international customers.
Also, I admit our prices can at times fall out of sync with market prices. At times, we fall behind due to ever changing prices. We'll work on offering much more competitive prices, but if you ever see a product that seems more expensive than it should be, let us know! We're happy to adjust prices based on customer feedback. We aim to be extremely customer feedback driven.
Thanks!
