Disagree on the DCA. The last 2 years if you DCAED and never took profit from 20k peak and now 13k double top you are in BIG red. You say TA doesn’t work. How did I know when the price failed to breach 13k twice that was the start of our drop/bear market. TA does work for bitcoin. I just shorted 8100 to 7750 because I knew the price would go down.  If you DCA but take profit at the peaks guess what you are doing? Trading.  There is no guarantee that it will ever make it past 20k. The monthly/yearly charts look awful dude.

The vast majority of people here are in fact moon boys. Most people here buy bitcoin as a “get rich quick scheme” or a retirement fund. 
They are better off learning some TA and going x25 with their money on an exchange. Hell that would actually be useful. Learn some TA and be able
to trade/invest stocks and currency pairs.

Looks like this ponzi is unraveling and bringing down all cryptos with it. So sad that all blockchain even if it’s a project that looks to have some actual legitimacy suffers when the rug gets pulled out from this scam.

You don’t think chainlink or vechain are good projects? Unlike bitcoin they actually do something and have a purpose. Bitcoin can never be an actual currency. Only a lame store of value. How can it be a lame store of value when the price of it fluctuates 5-10% a day or shoots up in a vertical fashion only to crash in a vertical fashion. Do you know how much money people have lost because of moon boys like you? 
Muh bitcoin will never be below 10k 11k 12k 13k again opps just crashed down to 7k.

Yeah when it pumps 3k in 2 hours that’s organic but when it slowly drops with no bounce that’s “manipulation”. People should have to take a basic TA class before being allowed to buy bitcoin.

No dude. We are in a bear market. It will probbaly go to 6k. Wait.
