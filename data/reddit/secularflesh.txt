Last time I made a large withdraw from BMO they also asked for a reason. I told them that was my business and none of their's. Still pissed me off that they asked in the first place.

If you have the paper wallet address or the transaction ID, you ca look it up here: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:55:45
It depends on the size of the transaction. Assuming the median transaction size of 226 bytes:
0.000243 BTC = 24,300 satoshis /226 bytes = 107.52 satoshis/byte. According to that site, it will likely take 1-24 blocks or 0-300 minutes to confirm.
The site tracks all the transactions being made and whether or not they have been confirmed and breaks them down by their fee rate. The orange bars are unconfirmed transactions and the blue bars are confirmed transactions. So the larger orange bars at the top of the chart tells you how unlikely it is for low fee transactions to be confirmed.

Probably crappy integrated graphics. Try GPU-Z.

Well that escalated quickly.  How easy is it to use Mt.Gox instead?
@_date: 2012-10-03 17:50:56

GPUs are designed to survive typical usage which is actually more stressful than mining 24-7 because periodic cooling and heating is more stressful than putting them on a constant load state. The fans were also designed to survive 100% speed for several years. Run them at stock speeds.

It only costs me 9.6 kwh.  I stash away a certain amount each week and spend/sell the rest regardless of the exchange rate and still make a small profit.
@_date: 2012-08-19 20:15:29
I've been mining with multiple cards for more than a year. They're all still running fine except for a couple of fan failures. I'm not worried about them at all and they've paid for themselves multiple times over.
I prescribe to the belief that the heating-cooling cycles that a video card experiences during normal use is more damaging then having them constantly stressed mining Bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-11-02 07:46:32
I perfer PPS, so I use MTRed and BTC Guild.  MTRed has merged mining, while BTC Guild has a lower fee, so they're about even IMO. I split my miners between them in case one goes down.
@_date: 2011-08-07 18:44:01
You will cost your company much more in electricity costs than you'll make from selling the Bitcoins you mine, which won't be much.  CPU mining is a waste of time.
@_date: 2011-11-16 19:23:26
The other factor is luck.  It's like playing the lottery by yourself vs. a large group of people.  You could potentially make 100x more than being in a pool or you might not solve a single block, even if you go at it for 12 straight months.
@_date: 2011-08-30 17:22:42
The recent price drop helped.
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:23:19
CPU mining is not worthwhile so for a dedicated mining machine you should use the cheapest most energy efficient CPU that's compatible with your motherboard. Most people use $30 single core Semprons.
@_date: 2011-07-02 19:45:54
That would undermine the entire idea behind rebates. They're supposed to be difficult so people don't bother with them.

I just bought a pair of 5850's for $145.59CDN each after tax and pay 0.096c/kwh.  Factoring difficulty increases proportional to the last one from here on out and using the current exchange rate, they will pay for themselves in 16 weeks according to my calculations. Plus I can sell them if I decide to quit, so I'll be technically be in profit in say 4 weeks.
It doesn't make sense to pay a lot for hardware, but if you have existing systems you can drop a card or two in, it can be worthwhile. It's a little pricy if you have to buy a mobo with 2-4 PCI-E 16x slots and a 600-1000W PSU on top of the graphics cards.
@_date: 2011-10-10 19:38:59
Unless your electricity cost is very low, you might be losing money already.  The HD 4000 series is not very efficient for mining.

Not rumor, speculation.
@_date: 2011-10-11 08:01:52
If your driving factor is cost, sell the 6770's. It's no longer profitable to build a machine soley for mining.
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:26:33
According to Bitcoin Charts, the network is doing 5.68 blocks per hour right now. Yesterday before the attacks it was 6.5 to 7.0.

That's the beauty of Bitcoin. When "everyone stops" the difficulty will drop and it will become profitable again. For example a bunch of miners quit when the price dropped to $7 a couple of weeks ago. The difficulty lowered and it became easier to mine.
The only way mining will become unprofitable for a long stretch of time is if the value of Bitcoins suffers a severe crash. But even then difficulty changes will eventually incentivize miners to come back. Mining won't stop unless Bitcoins somehow completely lose all value. 
@_date: 2011-11-10 16:58:40
Mining. I stash away 1 BTC per week and with the remainder either buy stuff or trade for cash. Super fun.
@_date: 2011-07-06 20:25:41
My 6870 gets 306 Mh 
My 5850 gets 370 Mh @ 925mhz/86C.
@_date: 2011-10-18 17:37:39
This doesn't really matter long term. The difficulty will go down to make it profitable again for some.
@_date: 2011-07-11 06:13:45
If you were really lucky, you would've been solo mining at the time.
@_date: 2011-07-07 07:35:03
Your system is pretty much worthless for mining. I don't think any Bitcoins you generate will even cover your electricity costs.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:28:46
LTC was designed intentionally to keep GPU mining alive and to keep ASICs out, so the difficulty will probably never skyrocket.  
I'm not that optmistic about LTC though. If you have mining hardware ready to go, it's worth mining if electricty is cheap but I wouldn't invest in any new hardware.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:48:57
I'm making about $20 a week off a trio of 5850's after electricity (cheap 7c/kwh).
@_date: 2013-01-23 08:09:56
I'm afraid you're too late my friend.  It will take you a long time to pay off a new rig at this point even if your electricity is free.
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:20:35
Should've switched the LTC. Switched all my GPU miners in May and traded everything i got for BTC immediately. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:55:34
The traders determine the going price - they make sell offers and buy offers.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:57:58
That's the beauty of the system. If the difficulty rises to the point where it's not worthwhile for a good chunk of miners to mine, they'll stop, the block generation rate will slow, and the difficulty will decrease.
It will always be worthwhile to **somebody**. Even if the price crashes to $5 tomorrow and 90% of miners disappear, eventually the difficulty level will drop to the point where it will be profitable for some of them to start up again.
@_date: 2013-10-01 16:35:02
They would have made 4-5x more mining litecoins. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:39:53
Yup, similar software involved. You need one that supports scrypt. I use cgminer.  
The good thing about LTC mining is it requires VRAM making it expensive for someone to create an ASIC for it, so it will be driven by GPU mining for the forseeable future. The difficulty level has been fairly constant at 1000~1200 for a couple of months.
The bad thing is it's barely profitable right now.  At stock settings, a 7850 will get about 350 kh/s which will net about 0.003 BTC's worth of LTC per day.  But back in the spring, I was planning on selling off my mining rigs. Litecoin was profitable enough to make them worth keeping.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:51:18
Yes, poorly worded. The network automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks **to try** to keep the block generation rate at one every 10 minutes.

The price is not an indicator of the health of Bitcoin.  It only needs to be high enough to be useful.
