decentralized? it doesn't stand a chance against ripple. it's already climbed to  so just you watch out! ^^^^/s

Would an old, crappy laptop do the trick?
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:42:53
I’m a hodler. I’ve paid people back in BTC. I send people BTC, but why should I be actively trading my assets? Especially ones I’m confident in.
I sold my IOTA for NEO, sure, but BTC is to stay.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:57:04
I suppose so. I’m in for the ride, sure. I believe in the technology.
That said, actions speak louder than words.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:36:04
I see, so a 6MB RAM laptop with a crappy, old AMD processor should still do the trick? If so, I may work on contributing to this! I'd be honored to help such a historic cause.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:32:02
Certainly. My problem lies in the fact that most of my bitcoin is from this year, particularly before the spike.
I'm under the assumption that I must hold it for a calendar year for it to be long-term, am I right in thinking that?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:23:49
Of course. I can't allow it to drip onto the wood. It's necessary to take all precautions when investing in Bitcoin. Particularly, watch your pantries and prepare for a slippery ride full of ups and downs. Some call it a stroke of luck. Others condemn it as cheating. At the end of the day, however, we hodl on tight and ride it as long as we can bear.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:05:04
am girl, can confirm -stamps seal of approval-
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:27:02
I've done a little research and bought in a small amount, as much as I can bear to lose on it, should things go south.
That said, I like what it offers, but I understand it's young and people have yet to really adopt it, even if it does appear to have hit mainstream cryptotalk. You are, in fact, some guy here; however, I value your opinions and passion for adopting a new crypto. Thank you for sharing!
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:48:52
Thank god. I thought I finally lost it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:49:09
I really thought I finally disconnected from reality.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:47:01
Great exchange, terrible wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:54:02
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:20:53
Yeah, after buying in, my pantries dropped.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:33:44
You seem to know what's going on. Please do help me mull through this.
Would it be plausible to split up your BTC -&gt; Fiat transactions over two or more fiscal years to help mitigate the taxes? Particularly when it's long term.
Say, if this guy wanted to stay in the 0% bracket, maybe he could only withdraw what is now like 1.5BTC this year. On Jan 1, 2018, could he withdraw another 1.5BTC and receive 0%, too?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:25:19
Oops haha. Alright, yes. In that case, the earnings are recorded as the price it is the very moment you receive the coin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:19:43
Can’t it be as low as 0%, should your total income and capital gain come out to be less than 37,000? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:16
I think I’ve got this meme all wrong!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:30
I appreciate your honesty! It was an idea I’ve been really liking the sound of. It would delay some plans, but it should work just fine.
I’ll dig deeper or find a financial advisor over the next year or so.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:15:01
Since you seem biased, what do you expect IOTA to do from here? The dip is discouraging, but not enough to drive me away completely.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:50:02
Fantastic. You really were quite informative, friend! If there's any knowledge or opinion you wish to get from me, feel free to ask.
I feel a bit indebted lol. Truth be told, I really do appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me.
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:50:17
Cool story.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:52:21
Try Electrum wallet.
There are a few other great options. Look it up online “top bitcoin wallets.”
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:35:10
How's that stagnation working for you? Patience is a virtue.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:18
Hi, it’s your friend
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:36:27
Am I the only one finds this incredibly unclear and confusing to read?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:16:50
Well, I uninstalled Coinbase from my phone, so I don’t see the price of BTC or any alts very often anymore.
During the crazy jump and my initial buy-in, sometimes I’d just sit there and watch the charts. I was obsessed.
Now, I’m kind of over it lol. I’ll hodl for the fiscal year and then probably diversify or sell if I need to. I doubt I will need to, though. Bitcoin is the future, so I may as well have some in hand.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:23:23
I figured. Thanks for helping me out!
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:08:00
I highly advise holding.
I’d go as far as to say that, at 9200, you should withdraw 15000 and pay your loan off.
Leave the rest in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:08:20
It’s funny because the statistics of people who bought tulips were about as low as BTC: 1%. It was made out to be an obsessive, cultural movement but it was nothing more than a gourmet item with futures.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:22:57
It's a collection of a lot of old passwords all in one chain, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:18:26
It’s not a problem. It’ll require hardware upgrades, much like gaming on ultra or 4K does currently. Tech is improving rapidly.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:28:36
How's your dogecoin hodling?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:54:16
I’m, uhm, sorry for your loss. -hugs-
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:54:04
Technological advances should help mitigate wastefulness. That said, yes, it’s not optimal **but it is**.
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:08:04






Jokes aside, I recommend fleshing out the women’s clothes. They’re pretty long tanks, btw. Like, more than I would expect or usually want haha.
The design for most the men clothes are a bit... unappealing for my more feminine tastes, and the ones you’re offering that are branded look fairly nice.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:38:34
Timely PSA:
**Please do not keep your BTC on exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Cryptopia...).**
**It is dangerous.** As in, there is a *far greater* chance of you losing your bitcoin.
Storing them in a wallet where you have access to their key is necessary and vital (we’re talking money here, right?). Options include both digital wallets such as Electrum and hardware wallets (cold storage, super safe) such as Ledger/Trezor.
With proper caution in place, your satoshis are a-okay.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:23:44
Trezor. Fite me.
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:33:09
This is silly. I’m working towards my astrophysics degree, so this isn’t a new topic to me at all.
The problem with the past systems were the fact that they were in use and were not designed or ran with the knowledge of an imminent solar storm. Additionally, solar storms of such a scale are rare, very rare.
Add that on top of our Sun’s own solar cycle of IIRC 19 years, it’s currently in a pretty moderate cycle. Oh, and there are plenty of massive flares that happen, but they’re seldom in the direction of our Earth.
The possibility of a paper wallet sounds like the probable solution. With current technology, we should be able to get an initial suspicion FUD for the event and then quick updates on its progress: enough time to panic sell, hodl, but the dip, or transfer to a paper wallet.
These emissions aren’t instantaneous haha.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:10:33
Arefulcay with the UDFay.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:37:06
Adding period at the end of every statement only makes you look silly and doesn’t add fact or any credibility. Period.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:12:24
Well, no need to be a hater!
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:50:55
How much water do you drink daily? I'm a pretty seasoned binge eater (for convenience) and I have to say one of my biggest issues is my hesitance to drink anything. At home, water comes from the tap. While I'm out? I'll grab a coffee MAYBE. I never buy drinks with my food and I never bring water with me.
All that does is make me feel more hungry than I actually am.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:27:07
Drinking more water could help curve your hunger a bit. It's worth a shot. Then you'd have leftovers for a snack, in the least.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:33:00
We need a time traveler who brings FUD!
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:25:05
I’m in college, but I’m also financially independent and work a full time job. I think that counts. Knowing college culture, though... not too many others are in the same boat.
This is a fairly valid accusation.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:59:55
It’s sold cost minus initial cost.
If you buy at 100 and sell at 110, then your profit is $10.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:53:05
I've never confused with before. This is new.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:44:34
Bitcoin amiibo when?
