I love Gemini, it's been my go to exchange. But for he love of god, could you please explain to me what the auctions are all about? I've read every bit of information that the website offers about it, and I still have zero idea of the potential benefits/risks.

As someone without a dog in the fight, the people disagreeing with you do make decent arguments. Not sure if I'd call them shills. However, I also don't know enough to really say that your argument is wrong or right.
If you're right though, that's a scary picture of what's to come if this whole BU/Core squabble isn't amicably resolved. And soon.

Fuuuuuuuuck you and your Federal Reserve... That's the dumbest thing I've read all day.

But won't increasing the blocksize that much make it even harder for smaller miners all over the world? If this is true, that scares me for a system that relies on decentralized participation for its security. Couldn't powerful groups be more likely to gain control over the system in the future?
As a bitcoin noob trying to make sense of all this, I'm simply just trying to gather honest and reliable information. Really have no dog in the fight at this point.

That's no excuse, he should know better by now.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:37:39
Do I buy more? Or wait til it settles back down? BUT WHAT IF IT DOESN'T GO BACK DOWN???

Is he really a Bilderberg employee? That's very interesting if true. From what it sounded like, Ver seems like the one who was pushing the angle you'd expect to come from the Bilderberg group. More centralization/consolidation of power.
Full disclosure, just got into bitcoin recently, and didn't even know this debate existed until I saw the Johnny vs Ver debate on youtube the other day. I have no dog in the fight, just trying to learn as much as I can about both sides' arguments.

I'd say sell only as much as you absolutely have to, and buy more when it drops. Anything can happen that could skyrocket the price (we've never had anything like this so we have even less of an idea about the potential effects). Same goes for it crashing, hence the gamble. 
But at what point do you realize that you're buying at the "low"? What happens if you wait too long and it's above where you sold it? 
Idk, I'm just spitballing really. Fairly new to bitcoin myself, that's just what I've picked up so far.

Love it.

The centralization part is the biggest aspect of this issue that I feel BU supporters generally do not have an answer for. The whole reason I bought bitcoin in the first place was the idea of a deflationary, decentralized, digital cryptocurrency. Take away the decentralized part, and it will be no different from the Federal Reserve within 30 years time (if that).

I did this too, despite my username...
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:02:25
Great... so all of my main exchanges. Awesome -_-
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:09:25
Yea right? If BU emerges as the dominant cook in the long run, isn't that still good for BTC holders in the long run? And if it goes the way of the other fork attempts, no harm no foul? 
Please correct me if I'm mistaken.
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:25:38
Doesn't recognize the word "bitcoin" either!

So from what I've gathered so far, increased block sizes require increased processing power for miners. This means that eventually smaller/independent miners and mining pools will not be able to keep up with the biggest/most powerful miners and pools. So rather than many nodes running around the world, a smaller few will dominate the blockchain. The smaller the number of miners, the more consolidated their power becomes, allowing the potential for TPTB to co-opt/control the entire Bitcoin network.
I'm still really new to all this, so please take what I say with some salt. And if anyone sees something that I got wrong, please feel free to correct me!

Ah well still thank you for even pointing that out to me! I'm very nervous about what the bankers are planning in terms of bitcoin. They're not just going to let the kind of power and control that they've enjoyed for so long just start to disappear without a fight (through either sabotage or co-opting).

$3723 high if passes, $798 low if fails. 
Edit: In the short run

Very aware. Created an account strictly for all the bitcoin subs last week since they would never show up on the front page of my main account.
Either way, I'm not r/btc shill. If anything I lean more towards the Segwit side of the argument, but that's only based on the limited amount of knowledge that I've gained so far.
While a newly created account may be an INDICATOR of shills, that does not make all new accounts shills.

Edit: Now Kraken too.

That's how hard forks have worked in the past (Ethereum Classic I think?). But this time, anyone with bitcoin in a wallet that they have the keys for, you're essentially airdropped an equal amount of BCC for how much BTC you have.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:13:57
My Ledger let me split my coins into completely separate wallets already, but not sure about the rest. 
Doesn't really matter that much right now though, considering they have yet to even mine a block on the new chain so far, meaning I can't transfer them to an exchange yet anyway.

Could also look at it as them making room for a whole new wave of investors that have been waiting for he market to dip again.
