Quoting Ayn Rand might not be the best tactic for convincing adults of a position.

How urgent a need is this? How many companies are in this boat? Is there competition in this space? I'm asking for... reasons.

It can, internal combustion doesn't, that's the whole reason that Elon is building electric cars...

Best thing in the article is repeating the claim that India is vowing to eradicate cryptocurrency. Honestly the more I read that the more I realize people are idiots. They vowed to crack down on illegal activities using cryptocurrency, nothing else, nothing new

There are a few people doing something like this already. I have 0.001BTC in physical form. The QR code is under a hologram sticker. It's really one-time use, then the coin is no longer locked up. The opendime thing in this thread seems cool. There is a guy near me who makes something similar to what I have but using gold and silver. They are very fancy, and very large.
I'm involved with a company that was looking at something like that, but we haven't come up with something that meets our security requirements.

That's the one I actually have. The problem we were having with it was that we couldn't verify the bitcoin reliably and make it reusable and counterfeit-proof.

This has come up a number of times. There a few reasons a payment processor is valuable to this industry. Recurring billing is the big one. Another is rapid access.

I know that, just trying to figure out if there's reasonable competition in the payment processing space right now or if bitpay left an empty market. Seems like btcpay might have the space pretty well served
