I figured there has to be some kind of weight limit, but I just looked it up and it says 70 lbs so maybe I will give this a try after all.

I feel like the flood gates are opening now. There's going to be lots of new money entering the market soon.

Kind of interesting combining something old school (physical mail) with something new age (Bitcoin). I got a coin jar, but this thing weighs a ton. Pretty sure the cost of shipping would outweigh the value.

15K is fine. It will be back to that pretty soon. Also conservative estimates put BTC at around 30K by the end of the year so you will be fine.

I just think we got spoiled and impatient due to the late 2017 bull run. I still believe we will hit ATH's by the end of the year, but it will take time. There has been a ton of good news for crypto lately so we just have to wait for the market to recover however long that will take.

First of all if the 100k people weren't right, what makes you think the 6k-3k bubble burst people are right? Second, it seems like people who post negatively have not been around the last couple of years. They tuned in last year during the hype and expected BTC to continue to fly forever. We have been in a slump for a few months now, but who cares. This year has been nothing but good news for BTC and crypto in general (well besides the prices). I am so pumped for what 2018 brings and yes I do believe that BTC hits 100k at some point.

This is huge news! Why isn't it being talked about everywhere? You do a search on Google News for Bitcoin and nothing comes up about this. It's mainly just a bunch of negative articles about the recent crash and stuff about scams.

Ah ok that makes sense. Thanks.

I had no idea that women were so under represented in the crypto market. This is like 50% of the world population that hasn't go involved yet so it's good news for everyone once they get in on the action.
Also the description for CryptoDel  was pretty damn funny haha.

I agree brick and mortar companies and news organizations would be some of the biggest rivals, but I wonder how many of many of those organizations saw that coming. I mean with crypto everyone is screaming "down with banks!" so the finance industry knows it's being targeted. When the Internet was first born, I feel it was marketed as a communication tool. It wasn't being treated as a news or commerce tool. At least that's the way I remember it. I guess at some point they probably saw the writing on the walls, but without an Internet to spread FUD there wasn't much they could do LOL.
