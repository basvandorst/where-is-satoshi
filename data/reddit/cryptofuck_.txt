lol i see your ideology gives you the moral high ground to ignore the obvious realities of life around you. Keep on enjoying your resentful existence!

ofcourse I do not support genocide; you are not even worth talking to as you blindly follow your ideology. it is not so black and white and to think it is is either naive, stupid, or a combo

you clearly adhere to a strict ideology and will not look at both sides of the situation. At least now you can justify yourself as a victim and feel bad for yourself!

venezuela had 99% inflation last year on the bolivar... It is getting so bad that their rich citizens fly to other countries and load up their private jets full of basic necessities like toilet paper, toothpaste, water, etc (I was told this by a taxi driver in Aruba, the closest island to venezeula, where all the rich load up on their goods).  I wonder what the bitcoin premium down there is??

Also reached this point, take crypto as payment in almost any situation I can unless I know I have an upcoming bill or something that needs to be paid
