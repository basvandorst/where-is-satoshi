You won't believe how little people know about the truth of it all, but normies will see it after the fact.

Yes but $1000 of Bitcoin is 8,700,000 sats 
2.1E15÷8000000000 people = 262,500 sats 
So just think about that 
You're exchanging Fiat shitcoin to gold 
Stack sats!!

LMFAO you think I support Btrash or shitcoinSV and it's fraud creater, think again, there's only one Bitcoin.

No he would not, he used to be but not anymore, Andreas is a shitcoin advocate.

1BTC = 1BTC

Plus exchanges are not just going to accept $100m deposit with 6 confirmations, the more conformations the accumulate the more hashpower they will need.

He would have went on and started talking about how your grandma will have her own coin and the grocery store across the street will have a different one and a coin for steak and milk and blah blah blah, money is meant to be a unit of account (one thing to facilitate trade) if you use more than one thing than that is considered barter and if you think that every company or country will have their own "cryptocurrency" is a joke, the whole point of money is to make trade easier with a global economy and an economy on the internet. He knows this yet sill advocates Etherium!! Like WTF! makes no sense to me why I'm being down voted on a Bitcoin forum, I thought this was agreed on
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:26:49
So explain why he advocate etherium knowing full well that this is a money race, and money is a zero-sum game. Makes no sense to have more then one currency, and we all know Bitcoin is the only sound money with a chance of becoming that.

I get your point, but you can't defend someone that supports a premind shitcoin. He knows full will about economics and what money is yet chooses to continue to support this idea of multiple coins, if he does not actually understand economics then maybe his not the right person to talk about Bitcoin. 
His almost every new persons first introduction to the "Crypto" world and almost immediately he goes on this rant about how everyone's going to have their own coin, which leads people to start investing in shit coins because they think that Bitcoin is some how the Myspace of crypto, without understanding money  and that it goes through stages (collectible, store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account), Network effect, Lindy effect, decentralization etc. They think that transaction speed and being environmentally friendly and avoiding mining is the way to go, so they start investing in shitcoin like (insert anything other then Bitcoin here). 
This is a fight for a protocol (A native internet currency), there is a reason why we all use TCP/IP. 
Cash, credit cards and debit cards are all under one currency depending on what country you live in and by the way there is only one reserve currency and that is the USD. Gold and only gold was used for thousands of years to facilitate trade and it made things much easier, money is like language the more people that speak the same language the easier it gets.
Watch this to get a better understanding of what I'm trying to say.

Yeah this is why love Reddit because logical people like you, I just hope you understand that there is a lot more going on here then just "100x profits, lambos and to the moon memes" people are working really hard to build something important. Bitcoin can really change the world for better.
This is a great essay on what money is
Another great resource is 
Listen to The Cryptoconomy Podcast
Good luck down the rabbit hole. And don't for get to stack sats for your family too!
