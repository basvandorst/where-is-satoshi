looks like theres a LOT of altcoins going way down in value on all altcoin exchanges
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:56:55
whats keeping you on bitstamp?
 theres 20 other exchanges that have minimal issues and will let you do btc/ltc trades
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:28:26
you chose to use 2fa cuz its secure as fuck and now you're complaining they are taking measure to make sure joe miner isnt trying to pretend hes you?
fuck man choose a side - i skipped 2fa completely cuz im boss as shit
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:02:43
agreed, coinbase works perfectly for me. Ive been verified for months so I buy my coins, transfer them to my wallets/exchanges, and have zero issues with rejects
I use bank of america if that matters
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:26:04
nah son thats lolllll
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:30:56
not literally use wire transfers, but attached your account and send money for free

@_date: 2017-02-09 05:00:51
ah ok, welcome to the wonderful world of pending transactions
that "transaction fee" is basically a bribe to get bitcoin miners to pick up your bitcoin and transfer it. Some places set it way too low, like 15 cents, and it can take HOURS for it to send/receive, even when the website says "you'll have it in 30 minutes to 1 hour!" thats total bs nowadays
if you dont get it in 4+ hours, go to  and plugin your transaction/TX ID and they will get it to budge.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:49:39

@_date: 2017-02-21 23:15:33
yes plenty, i bought a few at 700-800 dollars a few years ago, and now transferred them to GDAX (coinbase exchange) for zero fee selling on the stock market
since i missed the boat the last few times, i've slowly been selling $10 of bitcoin everytime its worth goes up a few bucks. Started at $1060 now at $1130 - just incase it crashes again im not empty handed
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:14:20
wire money into coinbase's exchange called GDAX, no fee buying ( can take a few days)
or if you HAVE to buy market price, try uphold.com, their fees are better
every website preys on people who just hear about bitcoin and want to buy in RIGHT NOW
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:34:58
these are going to take a month to get there lol

blockchain is notoriously slow for me. they put a 15 cent transaction fee for everything. Their calculations suck
take their fee and double/triple it
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:03:10
do they send you tax forms at the end of the year?
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:46:26
the fees suck when you want to send low money amounts
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:43:27

@_date: 2017-02-09 16:01:53
coinbase is attached to a decent change called GDAX, your account is literally the same
use STOP and LIMIT buy's and sells and you will never see anything more than a 20-25 cent fee
nobody should be straight up buying on coinbase they REALLY suck and their website "magically" goes into shit mode when bitcoin crashes
transfers from your coinbase wallets are instant and free too
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:58:40
oh thats lame as balls
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:38:59
Don't use bitcoin core that shit corrupts so easy.  I had some old coins on there it took forever to recover 
Look up bread wallet or electrum  . Or store them online with blockchain.info
Basically you do not want your entire bitcoin collection to depend on a single file    
Regarding your pending, requesting won't do anything. You need to manually send them from the wallet with money.

its not going to go straight up but one look at a money graph and its not really going down that much, maybe $100 up and down daily 
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:28:46
yes it takes an entire week to transfer on GDAX, their 3 businessdays line is totall bullshit

so what you're saying is, if Bitcoin doesn't get the go ahead, we have Obama and the Democrats to thank for their obstruction
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:27:12
absolute luck too 
when the etf announced I was holding a bunch of coin i bought at 1200 and above
i saw it all drop before my eyes thinking "oh FUUUU" and put in a market SELL order for ALL of it, ended up saying "PENDING" for 5 minutes and then it showed my sell triggered at 1100 for all of it
before GDAX booted me off the site i put in random bitcoin buys at 1000 and 990 thinking "thers no fuckin way this is going to work"
lo and behold, gdax locks me out of the friggen website for 30 minutes and im fuming
the price is 1120 and im still locked the frig out
finally i get in and luckily i had 4 btc waiting for me
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:31:44

VERY secure, requires a special login, authenticator sms, AND EMAIL in order to get you logged in
pretty damn secure. no downloads necessary
also you are able to create your own wallet with your favorite offline app and import your custom wallet which is nice, mine has my name in it. I have my own passphrases so incase it ever goes down i still own my wallet
only downside is its crappy at guessing correct transaction fees so they take a while to send
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:49:56
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:56:12
blockchain.info lets you import a wallet generated from a 3rd party program
so i have my own passcodes/passphrases but can manage the entire thing online... and if it goes off-line, no worries at all

@_date: 2017-01-08 09:24:57
500 bucks a day
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:46:26
if you just want to buy and not play the market, try  less fees, site never goes down, $500 daily limit but instant verification
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:58:44
their graphing/charting sucks though
its so ugly
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:55:02
use uphold.com, same deal, less issues

could be exactly what Trump has been saying for months, the Chinese manipulate their money like WOAH
just look at the bullshit that happened overnight for NO reason
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:15:26
signed up for OkCoin as a test, its chinese based
Deposits are done by a third party (perfect money) and they charge 3% just to put your money INTO your account - da fuq
Bitstamp is the same way, based in Europe so gotta use a third party with high fee just to put IN money if you live in the USA
no freaking way im losing money before i even BUY anything
im checking out Gemini.com , made by those Winklevoss facebook dudes, very legit and US based
 looks good with almost zero fees, but verification is 1-3 days
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:06:42
it lets you buy coins cheaper than Coinbase, has instant verification, and the site isn't going down every 5 minutes
so yeah if thats all you need to do, it seems like a winner
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:39:12
when it crashes, i can cash out quick and easy during the dip
instead of waiting a 1-2 hours for a big transfer to confirm into coinbase, missing the crash, then selling at the bottom of the crash when bitcoin becomes worthless
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:02:52
Because China fucks with the price, like they do their own currency 
It's what trump has been saying for months 
Now you see it first hand 
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:26:21
Use uphold.Com
Low limit but never crashes and had instant verification 
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:13:24
where do we go to sell bitcoin?? im a thousand aire now
@_date: 2017-01-11 23:19:38

@_date: 2017-01-07 12:43:26
ah i see, this makes sense
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:36:09
yeah weird shit going on with their transaction fees
I had 2 btc on there and they wanted me to pay almost 2 bucks dollars to transfer
i changed the value to 1.9 and was able to transfer for a few cents, then the remaining BTC i wanted to transfer still had a ridic high fee
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:02:42
instant verification
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:37:56
so i can dump at 1100 again
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:42:52
THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN

@_date: 2017-01-08 09:06:49
I looked but they delete anyold versions from their site and there are no mirrors that go that far back on the net
just a cautionary tale when people tell you to "TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR KEYS, DOWNLOAD AN APP TO YOUR PC/PHONE TO KEEP YOUR COINS SAFE"
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:32:51
ugh yeah coinbase's website manages to eat shit the moment prices drop to all time low's or all time highs (in the last week)
mother fucker
if only there was anything else in the USA that was easy to set up and verify and buy, and didn't take a week to get your accounts connected/setup and bank wires to go through
i'd move pretty fast
i got verified on bitstamp only to realize it's a fuckin european site and in order to get USD on there you end up spending massive money in fees trying to use a third party transfer site
signed up for gemini, but now i gotta wait to get verified in 1-4 days, bitcoin might be over by then lol
Trying to find the lowest fees to buy
Uphold current has a .75% fee to buy which comes out to $7.50 to buy 1 BTC at $1000
Gemini requires you to send money and then buy, and costs $2.47 fee to buy 1 BTC from the market
Coinbase is about 1% or $10 for 1btc with a straight bank fransfer, or $18 instant buy with a Credit Card
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:44:03
Wtf is segwit
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:14:05
uphold.com has has a 0.75 fee so you save a few bucks, also the site never goes down - site is similar to coinbase - verification is instant, limit of $500 bank transfer a day
gemini is good from what i hear but it will take 3-4 days to just get verified and do anything
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:44:23
lol pizza
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:49:51

you can get around this by using the app btw, thats what support told me and it worked

@_date: 2017-01-07 12:44:59

@_date: 2017-01-09 02:54:22
seems like a gamble - site is basically a form that says "send bitcoin here and put in your email, then pray for the best"

@_date: 2017-01-07 04:21:21
Fuck yes God Emporer 
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:18:37
because bitcoin went from "meh, dead, nobody GAF" to "holy shit its the best friggen thing ever i need some" literally overnight
used to take DAYS to confirm, up until a few days ago most places said "30 minutes tops", now it can take hours to days again cuz its popular as fuck
the more money you add on as a transaction fee the faster you confirm
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:49:37
i got sick of the Coinbase crashing/outages during the surges and drops and have been looking for US alternatives
made accounts on a bunch of sites but they all have these long ass verification processes that could day 1-5 days
Saw somebody mention  in another thread - pretty minimalistic coinbase-ish type site (no exchange bs)
Turns out, the fees are even better than Coinbase
signed up for Uphold and also got instant User AND Bank Verification too which means I made an account and was able to buy within 10 minute
Downside seems to be A low $500 daily cap on transferring in money 
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:10:20
heres the truth from somebody not part of the bitcoin cult but was big on mining 3 years ago
its because the market is controlled 99% by China, a country which manipulates its currency on a dime , and really rich chinese traders control and manipulate the market (look up who wolong was)
two days ago the chinese yuan dropped its value literally overnight, and thus bitcoin took a shit
nobody here wants to admit it though - everyone will lost interest in a week when it crashes to half its value, and then will be the time to buy when its $400 again, so everyone can wait another 2-3 years to hit $1100 again to dump it
this is exactly like what happened a few years ago
bitcoin will never become anything more than a pump/dump scheme until China gets kicked out of the market - its too volatile
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:44:41
then u r smart

@_date: 2017-01-03 02:44:20
It's volatile as fuck 
It literally lost 3/4 of its value in a month a few years ago because of the Chinese manipulating its cost
It should currently be seen as a stock  
Dangerous

@_date: 2013-12-06 21:23:50
thanks man this is awesome
One thing though, why does my "Current $ override" affect the "Sell for even" and "sell for 20%"?
i figure the "sell for even" boxes would average what $$ was spent originally and say "well you spent xxx amount of money, in order to break even you would have to sell at xxx amount"
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:40:37
wow this is freakin awesome thanks!
love how it uses bitstamp since we're buying with coinbase
I would love to be able to change the "Sell for %"  see the actual profit if it was sold for that amount, and more importantly be able to change the "current value" (you know... so we can speculate)
