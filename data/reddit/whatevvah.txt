Fuck Warren Buffet and Bill Gates too.  These two are so rich that they are consumed by their own hubris due to the fawning sycophants that drool over every sentence they utter.  Bitcoin will be around because it has a perceived value.  Governments will try to regulate it and ban it but they can't kill it.  The limited number of coins will drive the price up eventually as more and more people are using it.  What the naysayers don't understand is that Bitcoin does not function like a currency.  It is a stored value and a means to transfer funds with no banks involved.  It's not going to replace fiat but it will be attractive as a place to store money in Countries where the currency devalues or is unstable such as Venezuela.  I was a Bitcoin miner in 2013.  Everyone thought I had lost my mind.  Now even the investment shows I listen to on the radio are talking about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a better way to transfer money than traditional banking system.  People often focus on comparison to currency and overlook this aspect.  As long as you can convert back to fiat easily at the other end the volatility of bitcoin poses little risk as a means of International funds transfer.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:31:15
Exactly!  And how much does a bank International wire transfer cost and how long does it take?  Or Western Union for that matter.  As long as you can convert to fiat at other end you are good.
Bitcoin is a little to volatile for me as a stored value.  I would prefer to take my chances with traditional investments.  Well I would invest some in crypto but not leave a significant amount of my assets in it.  
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:21:50
I'm not sure all those that bought at 20K would agree.  It's volatile as fuck.  Lot's of people got burned on the hype last run up.  If you are in it makes sense to hold but I would proceed with caution.  If you are going to buy in be prepared to ride it out for five years.  I was in at $60 sold at $600.  Thinking about buying in again soon.

Very on point Sir.  I have been following Bitcoin since 2013.  The increase in value is inherent in the way it was designed with a limited number of coins.  As long as there is perceived value among owners of coin you cannot destroy it.  It is a mistake to think of BTC as a currency.  That is a common misconception.  It is a stored value and a means to transfer money.  Much better than gold because it is more liquid.  It will go up and down but over time it will go up.  It makes sense in Countries where the currency is unstable.

Cashed out at $600 BTC

Former bitcoin miner here. I don't think you can harness enough power from solar to mine profitably.  I do like the idea though.  
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:45:57
Former bitcoin miner here.  I mined for six months starting in November of 2013.  I had free electricity - it was included in my rent.  I took my machines offline when the level of difficulty became to high.  By the time I got my machines which were 9 months late from what was promised I barely was able to recoup my investment.  However, with the ensuing increase in BTC in the past few years it was well worth it.  That being said I would have made bank if I just invested in BTC when I bought my machines.  That would have been when it was about $60.  To make money today you need hundreds if not thousands of miners and lowest cost electricity and somewhere where it is cold to keep machines cool to run efficiently.  It was great fun.  I really enjoyed although my friends and famnily thought I was nuts.  Now everyone is calling me asking what I did with my BTC.

It's really not a currency.  People miss the point comparing it to currency.  It's a stored value like gold and a low cost means to transfer funds.  I don't see it as displacing currency anytime soon.  
@_date: 2019-02-17 18:12:35
Thanks for the explanation!  I was wondering what it was also.  Makes sense and it is a cool innovation in the Bitcoin realm.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:34:27
As a casual observer of Bitcoin it's almost a good thing that the price has been relatively stable for a while.  Isn't that what it needs to be adopted mainstream as an alternative currency and not just a stored value or means of transferring money?
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:28:26
I've seen these ads on craigslist.  Told them I would drive to military base with cash to pick up the vehicle or have my "cousin" who lives there pick the car up.  That was the end of the conversation.
So the scammers used Bitcoin to transfer funds?  Big deal.  There are other ways not as easy but zer are wayz.  I would not blame this on Bitcoin per se.  Craigslist/ebay should flag these ads.  They are easy to spot.  Buyer beware.  It it looks to good to be true it probably isn't.

Chinese Dude lost his life savings in Bitcoin held on the exchange.  Not too smart.  If I was going to put all my money in Bitcoin then I would put it in cold storage in a safe deposit box not on a crypto exchange.  It's still the wild west.  Not enough safeguards at exchanges and vulnerable to hacking.  How could the exchange hold all this money with no contingency for the cold storage and demise of key holder? ........This is me looking at things now after being in Bitcoin back in 2103.

Rather than mine for gold invest in shovels.  I like Square as a company.  I use paypal and stripe to process cc payments as well but I like Square better.  Would rather invest in square than directly in bitcoin.  Looking to balance out my portfolio with some long plays.  Like the stability of investing in Square as a company as opposed to Bitcoin.

He points  out bitcoins use as a money transfer vehicle.  I think part of the problem is people are comparing bitcoin to a currency.  It's not there...yet.  It functions as a way to quickly and economically and anonymously transfer money and as a stored value.  That is why people in countries like Venezuela see it as a safe haven for their money.  It is promising that Bitcoin has been bottomed out at $6400 for a while.  It's not going to go away as long as people have a perceived value.  I think it will continue to grow as a stored value similar to gold.  I don't know if it will ever be a mainstream currency but I think that people should be considering it as part of an investment strategy.  There is tremendous pressure over the long term for Bitcoin to rise in value.

I pre-ordered four butterfly labs asic miners in 2013. Got them about two months later.  When I placed my order BTC was about $60.  Got my machines and it was like $1000.  Made two BTC mining.  Sold in 2014 when it was like $600. I'm thinking of buying in again.  Clearly bitcoin isn't going away.  Everybody thought I was crazy back in 2013. Now even the financial shows on the radio I listen to are talking about it.

Been out since 2014.  I've started paying attention again.  I'm thinking about buying $1K and putting in an offline wallet and forgetting about it for a few years. Still plenty of room for growth in my opinion.

Paul Krugman said Bitcoin is a ponzi.  That is as good an endorsement as you can get.  Mr. Krugman also said that the Trump tax cuts would destroy the economy.  Krugman is an ass hat that writes for the New York Times.

Satoshi has the first 980,000 coins.  If he ever decided to sell it would tank the market.  Also when there are large holders (Whales) they can manipulate the price and buy back when everyone panics and sells.  I experienced this small scale on a Bitcoin exchange.  Very hard for small player to make money.  Perhaps I'm oversimplifying.....
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:34:29
I bought miners from Butterfly Labs in 2013.  I just barely ekked out 2 BTC after waiting over 9 months for them to arrive while the level of difficulty went up.  Long story short I agree 100% with your assessment.  Bitcoing mining schemes=scam.  Better to just invest in crypto if you have the cojones and hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:32:52
Ahhh I stand corrected.  I have been out of the mining game since 2014.  Out of Bitcoin since 2015.  Haven't been following things closely until recently.

He wouldn't be able to mine bitcoin with graphics cards.  Litecoin yes but bitcoin has long since increased in difficulty to where you could mine with graphics cards.

Heard some good news today.  Financial heavyweights are looking at it seriously.  Fidelity has a bitcoin project that has quietly been in the works.  
One thing they talked about use of bitcoin for international money transfers.  It's much cheaper and quicker than international money transfers.

That was how it was described in the popular financial radio show I was listening to.  My point being that this is hitting the mainstream media nothing new to avid bitcoiners following the news.  I was in to bitcoin in 2013 when I bought four miners.  Everyone thought I was crazy.  Now it's hitting the mainstream media.

What do you define as "deep poverty"?  Low income and or broke is better than being saddled with debt a slave to house payments, car payments and credit cards.  If you are debt free then you can adjust your lifestyle to where you have cash flow and thus the means to invest.
I would not expect any quick returns on bitcoin so invest and forget for a few years is good.  I would be looking at 5-10 year time horizon. There are a limited number of bitcoins that will be produced so over time the limited supply will boost price as long as it stays viable.  
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:49:54
This guy understand nothing about Bitcoin.  What an ass hat!
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:59:55
I didn't either.  I bought four butterfly labs miners in 2013 and waited nine months for delivery.  I then ekked out 2 BTC in a few months before the level of difficulty went up.  Of course I sold them at $600 way before BTC peaked.  It was fun though.  Wish I had just bought bitcoin instead of the miners.  I was just thinking of buying some and thought it was a good buy until it dropped again.  It's still the wild west out there with crypto.
