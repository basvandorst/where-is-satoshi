You know, I actually support beating libertarians just for being libertarians. Take them into the street and gang up on them and just beat them until they're bleeding out their eye sockets. Fuck libertarians.

And because capitalists are so generous, they always fire employees that ask for minimum wage because they didn't get it in tips.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:56:03
Oh, I focus my attention on both. That is why revolution is necessary. To purge the capitalists running business and the nation.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:30:40
You are a prick and should be taken out and beaten.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:28:38
Because, in this libertarian fantasy land, you can literally pick any job you want to, even if you don't have a college degree, and make it last forever.

Hey now, tipping wouldn't be necessary if servers made livable wages.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:15:09
So advocate for livable wages for servers.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:33:40
What about the employees that fire workers for completely unrelated reasons for asking for minimum wage, then the employees spend years unemployed suing for their job back.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:16:07
Yeah, people shouldn't be given money if they didn't grow up white and male and come from money that gave them the ability to go to college to get a good job! fuck them! Let them die in the streets because I want to buy a second Corvette! Fuck them!
Yeah, more evidence you should be fucking shot.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:23:38
Fuck you. You don't make a livable wage as a server. They kiss ass just to get a livable wage? What the fuck do you do? Pigs like you make me sick.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:44:44
You didn't provide me a service. Hell, you made my life worse, I expect a 600 dollar tip from you. Honestly, when the revolution comes, I really hope for a purge of people like you.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:31:54
They are guaranteed minimum wage. When they say their tips didn't add up, they get fired from completely unrelated reasons. Then, because that is illegal, they spend years unemployed suing just to get their job back.
You have no idea how the service system works.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:39:52
Just because they are guaranteed it by law doesn't mean it happens! Capitalists will do anything to short-hand workers, including firing them for asking for min-wage. It happens all the time! Just because it doesn't happen to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen!

Voluntaryism isn't as voluntary as you speak. Communism is the best way to go, it doesn't inhibit individual freedom.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:27:02
All restaurants in the US expect tips. That is general. You are obligated to tell them otherwise so they don't perform decent service for you to only make 2 bucks.

"If you don't like poorly thought on libertarian money, you are probably a lazy pleb"
Lol, sounds just like lolbertarian semantics.
