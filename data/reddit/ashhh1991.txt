Upvoted. Gonna give some advice that has probably been given just to make this reply a little more meaningful.
If you haven't already, try tagging them on social media too (Twitter, FB etc.)

I had bought one at $330 and sold it at $370 yesterday. ):
Bought one again today at $428. I hope this is just a monthly peak like last month.
I'm definitely buying a lot if the price goes back below $350.

This post reminds me too much of work. I'm often surprised some of you people can even remember to breathe.

This is a good analogy. Currency can change in value (as shown in this example). Bitcoin is much more volatile than USD. So if you have 10 bitcoins today, it might be worth much more, or much less in a year.
This happens with countries' currencies too (think "inflation"). For example, An Australian Dollar is worth about 60% of its value today than it was in 2011 (when compared to USD). So, if you're an Australian citizen and had $100k in savings in 2011; even though you still have $100k in 2016, that money is worth much less. You didn't "buy" that money and you aren't exchanging it to and back from USD on a regular basis. The only thing that has changed is that everything has suddenly become more expensive.
"So technically as currency, it didn't really change, correct? I'm still spending the same amount of money". In this sentence, you seem to be referencing bitcoin as a "currency", but you're also talking about USD when you say "money". When you use two different currencies at the same time, they become investment products. Technically, all currencies are investment products, since they can gain or lose in value. However, unless there's a major change, we can think of them as a fixed value product (as most people do with USD). Luckily, the USD hasn't changed in value much, so most of us don't notice currency's definition as an "investment product". But the citizens of Australia (especially the rich ones who had a lot of money saved as AUD), noticed its value when it declined 40% over the last four years.
If you own even one bitcoin, then any change in its value affects you. If it gains value, then you become richer. If it loses value, you become poorer.

At $520, you'd have 0.192 coin.
At $420, you'd have 0.238 coin.
If you're thinking of bitcoin as an investment product, then if you bought $100 worth of bitcoin when it was $420, that purchase is now worth $124. You made $24.
If you're thinking of bitcoin as a currency, then things that used to cost 0.238 bitcoin got cheaper and should now cost 0.192 bitcoin.
