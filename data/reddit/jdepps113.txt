I can't speak to what you specifically do, or why.
But it wasn't that long ago that much of the saving that was done by individuals was by depositing in banks, and people could save that way for the long term at a low risk and get returns that beat inflation.  You weren't required to invest in the stock/bond/commodities markets to get a return because you could get a modest one at your bank and it was considered safe.
Some would keep all their money in the bank, and the bank would then get to loan that money out to make a return--but they had to avoid being too risky because if they were, nobody would trust that bank and it might default.
We live under a different system now, where banks get most of their capital from the central bank instead of from the pool of wealth in society that they can attract with a combination of security and returns on investment, and it's changed in my lifetime, with cheap money policies that create bubble economies but not real growth and production.
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:08:33
Loose monetary policy is the scourge of civilization.  It is the major reason for the world's economic troubles, and this story, where Germans do not want to deposit in banks where they're losing money over time, is just one small aspect of it.
You can bet they trusted banks when rates were higher and they could earn interest that beat inflation handily.  And that lure that causes people to save and invest their money in the banking system is what a healthy banking system lives on.
Our current world banking system lives on cheap, or even free money injected into them from the cartel of central banks who control the world's currencies.  The banks then look for speculative ways to get a return, and the minute rates go up any significant amount, they'll all be insolvent in short order--but they should be.  When the dust settles and the losses written off, and the restructuring is complete, we'd have a banking sector smaller but more vibrant, and a healthier economy.
By having a great deal of society's resources diverted directly to the banking/financial sector by the central bank, rather than having individual depositors be the ones to provide them money to lend out, we have created a financial sector that's bloated and unaccountable, and is stifling the rest of the economy more and more each year.
Letting the whole thing collapse and rebuild on a sounder footing in 2008 would have been the best thing that could have happened to the world economy, and for the cause of peace, freedom and human flourishing in general.  
But instead our leaders were convinced of the need to double down on the current failing order and make it immune to market forces of capitalism where businesses are permitted to be created and grown--but also, to fail, dissolve and liquidate assets which can then be used elsewhere in the market in ways more demanded by consumers--by bailing out the banks and engaging in huge transfers of wealth to the big financial players.
At best, they're extremely misguided and don't understand the extent of how destructive these policies are.  (Many unfortunately highly-regarded economists who follow deeply flawed models, support these policies.  In fact, it's practically a dogma in the economics profession that these neo-Keynesian cheap money policies are the greatest thing since sliced bread, and the only thing holding the world economy together, while anyone who disagrees is essentially relegated to the realm of being a "fringe" economist, banished to their own separate academic world.)
At worst, they are villains who are stealing the wealth of the world because they can, and they fully understand how wrong these policies are and the harm they cause.
As humans, it's somewhere in between.  People often convince themselves that what is in their own interests is what's best for society. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:27:59
I'm guessing it was probably in the 80's/early 90's, with the situation of rates trending downward in the long run from then till now.  I could be wrong about when it started to change, but the long-term trajectory has been toward lower and lower rates and now negative rates.
I'm just basing this on my understanding of current world rates and my more specific knowledge of US rates historically during this time period.  I am not exactly sure but I am fairly certain that German rates have followed the same trends as the US, approximately, over that period of time, and I'm very confident that Eurozone rates are in line with the same loose monetary policy we see in Japan, and in the US, and most of the world.

You suspected wrong.  I've read that whole thing, it's nonsense.  They just haven't ever conducted systematic studies to prove it, but it doesn't mean there isn't plenty of anecdotal evidence, and pretty much every single dentist says to do it, and that according to their own experience, patients who floss have better dental health than those who don't.
If they actually do long-term studies, they'll prove flossing works.  It's foolish to believe otherwise.  Might as well believe you don't need to brush your teeth, either.
It would be the same as if there had never been a long-term study to prove that exercising is good for you, so we all decided that must mean it isn't and it's healthy to sit around all day every day.  Or if there had never been a study proving that cigarettes cause cancer.  Just because there aren't yet conclusive studies conforming to scientific standards in peer-reviewed journals, doesn't mean an effect isn't there.

I admire what you did, I agree with your conclusions, and I enjoyed this story thoroughly.
I have to ask, though, because it's the one thing that would concern me the most about adopting the kind of lifestyle you did, here: how did you care for your teeth during that time?
Might sound crazy, but that's the one thing that would keep me from doing it.  I have brushed and flossed religiously my entire life and I'd be afraid that I'd do damage to my teeth if I had to live off the land like this, and I would not be willing to do that just to try something.
Well, also, I have asthma, so I'd have to cheat by keeping an albuterol inhaler handy.

I don't know why this is so hard to understand.  The dude doesn't have to be right, for his opinion to be of importance.  It is still an indication of what others in financial markets, outside of are thinking as it pertains to bitcoin.
Do you have to take the dude's prediction at face value?  No.  But saying it's irrelevant to bring up or post in here is just stupid.
It's a lot more relevant to the value of Bitcoin than half the stupid drama that gets posted in here about things like the Bitcoin Foundation
EDIT: fixed small error
EDIT 2: Let me put it another way: the predictions of major hedge fund guys in the financial markets are ALWAYS important enough to report on, whether it's about Bitcoin or anything else.  This is because their predictions move markets.  Right or wrong, a lot of people are listening to these guys in the market, so just the fact that the dude said something can mean millions or billions or money moving one way or another.
It's important to know this, regardless of the fundamental soundness of the prediction itself.  He could be 100% right, or he could be a moron, but when big market movers talk, you listen, because you know others are also listening and some are going to be acting based on what they hear.  It's sure to create ripples in the market.

Greece was collecting plenty in taxes.  They just are paying for more than they should be, with public sector employees retiring at a very early age with a generous pension, and many more public sector employees than are actually needed in the first place.
The problem isn't that they can't pay for all the government they need; the problem is they are paying for a lot more than they need.
But try to tell people they can't retire at 50 anymore if they work for the state, and see how far you get.  Them motherfuckers is organized, and they vote, and they strike, and they pay for ads to get a good chunk of the (gullible) public on their side.
Greece never had a revenue problem, they had a spending problem.  They were spending too much, and getting too little for it.  And they really didn't solve this problem, either, although they reined it in very slightly.

I think it's important to be aware that the arguments against bitcoin being legal are merely a diversionary tactic.  
The real reason the government would like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the same as the reason it left the gold standard--they want complete control of the nation's money supply so they can engage in all the kinds of chicanery they do without there being a safety valve or an alternative for the citizens.

Let's keep in mind that MtGox stands for Magic the Gathering Online Exchange.
These people fell into the market of being a currency exchange.  It wasn't the business they planned to be in, it's just the one that they happened to be in a position to take on as a huge new opportunity pretty much just appeared in front of them.  Of course, in this new crypto market, nobody's an expert about how to do things, since it's all so new, but these weren't experts on how to operate such a business in the old currency market, either.  
They've thrown together an apparatus to deal with a business they never planned to get into, on a scale they never could have imagined when they started.  And while they've done a reasonably good job when you consider all that--there are bound to be huge problems that you wouldn't expect from a company of this prominence in any other more established industry, and especially in the area of security.
Not saying that necessarily excuses them, but it certainly explains it for people who may think they're doing anything diabolical.  I doubt they are, but their systems and security and everything else about their organization is probably not able to handle things at the level we would think they should be, since they're pretty much a small business that got huge through one part ingenuity combined with eight parts pure luck.
EDIT: I should add though, that someone in their position who started out honest, can wind up doing dishonest things after they find themselves in big trouble through their ineptitude.  You fuck up, you go: oh shit!, and you immediately scramble to try and hide your fuckups--and this can lead from doing things that were innocent in nature, to things that aren't, hoping you can fix the situation, get everything back under control, and proceed without letting everything fall apart and have to admit the problems.

Plus, there's just the issue of knowing how to do it.  When you pay someone with expertise to do something for you, you're not paying them just for their time--you're paying them for their knowledge combined with work.
For a lot of businesses, if you believe Bitcoin will be big going forward, $400 is nothing to be able to accept Bitcoin starting now and lasting through the future.  They pay the $400 and the issue is taken care of.

The aspect that applies to cash is that simply possessing cash in large amounts means they can seize it, without any other evidence or anything.

@_date: 2015-05-07 00:00:50
I think you're missing the point, perhaps because the dude is failing miserably at explaining it.  
Cash loses fungibility when its use is considered high risk for being taken at will by the government.
People are less likely to accept a large sum in cash knowing that it could simply be grabbed by the police before they can even get it to the bank.
So if these asset forfeitures change people's behavior with regard to cash, and make them less willing to accept or possess large quantities, by increasing the risk of transacting using cash, they are in a very real sense adversely impacting its fungibility.
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:54:36
Amazingly, without passing a law saying it's illegal to own a bunch of cash, they've used asset forfeiture to effectively make it illegal in practice.
Who would keep a lot of cash when it can just be taken at will?  I'm sure they can grab it from your home, too.

I want to jump all over the banks, but there has to be a reason they'd turn away good business.  I'm sure Chase isn't on some moral Christian crusade (pretty sure, anyway), so I would tend to look at other reasons: namely, government regulations.
Banking regulations, particularly in the realm of AML (anti money-laundering), are quite lengthy, onerous, and generally ridiculous, with vast unintended consequences and casualties in terms of people affected who shouldn't be, and banks are proactive in attempting to avoid falling afoul of any regulations.
There has to be some kind of government regulation that the banks are trying their hardest to avoid falling afoul of it.  Especially when in recent times banks have been held accountable for activities of account holders beyond what would be consider the banks' due diligence, in some cases.
My best guess: they are dumping accounts for anyone who, they fear, could be engaging in prostitution, and who might be depositing prostitution-related funds into their account.  A LOT of porn stars have an escort business on the side, which in many cases accounts for a great deal of their income.  I am not certain if this applies to Teagan Presley, or any of the others mentioned in the article, although it might, or even if it doesn't, the bank might be afraid it does and be dumping her as a customer for that reason.  But it's also possible that if it does, they've seen some evidence thereof.
All of that said, it's absurd that this is illegal anyway, or that banks and individuals have to jump through all these government hoops, or that government should be preventing people from making transactions they want to for whatever purpose in a free market.  I don't visit prostitutes, but those who do have every right to do so, as long as the women (or men) are there of their own free choice--which, in an open, above-board, free market, in the light of day, they are more likely to be, and less likely to be forced into it against their will.  And the people who want to sell these services should be allowed to do so, as long as they're adults of sound mind--and should have access to banking services just like anyone else in any other profession.
So even if it's for perfectly understandable legal reasons on the part of the bank, it's still a bunch of bullshit.

So many speculators, such a small market cap relative to what it would be if adopted on a larger scale, for a system/currency that has pretty low adoption as yet, considering its worldwide nature, so much unbridled enthusiasm for the potential, and also such skepticism and fear, all toward the same thing which has no easy parallels to which its prospects might easily be compared.
It's no wonder that the market is volatile.  Huge moves are possible for things that are based on bitcoin itself, or even just moves that reflect an instability in some nation or some big article that said one thing or another.... lots to think about that really move the price.
If you are trying to time the bitcoin market and trade on it short term, that's a lot of risk and who knows if you'll make or lose money.   I sure don't.  Ultimately this is about where you think it's going in the long run, and the question of what happens over the short or even medium term with the price of Bitcoin is just a guess.  It might drop back down to $200 before it gets to $1000 or even $10k again, but in the end, if you don't think it has some flaw or vulnerability that will one day undermine the entirety of Bitcoin and cause it to crash to zero and be defunct--if it truly is what it claims to be and has the security people expect--then you have to be expecting it will one day reach way higher than it's gone so far.

Does anyone know for sure exactly where all the users are?  
I bet the Venezuelan situation is contributing right now to BTC's current rise.  I'd virtually guarantee that the use of bitcoin is rising there as their currency becomes so dangerously, hugely inflationary that even holding them a short period of time is an automatic huge loss.
I'm sure some Greeks were using it too, but other things happening in the BTC market could have offset what would otherwise have been gains around that time.
Markets are wrong until they're right.  They can go off half-cocked for long periods of time on misunderstandings of what developments mean--but they get to the right understanding eventually, sometimes suddenly.  And it'll be the same with Bitcoin.  As long as it's got strong underlying fundamentals and doesn't have major vulnerabilities we don't anticipate, it will ultimately see its full potential realized.

The clueless person in this equation is you.  Everything you think you understand you have absolutely ass-backwards.
Bolivares don't just lose value because of magic.  They lose value because the government is creating so many more of them as quickly as they can to pay all their bills.  This steals the value from all the bolivares already out there, but the government doesn't care, because they can always just print more, meaning they can always print enough to pay their bills.
And the rich are either on the receiving end of this never-ending stream of newly-create bolivares, or they had the ability to get their wealth out of bolivares before this happened.
To the extent that Venezuela's economy sucks, it's because of their unstable, inflationary currency, which was caused entirely by their government and their unwillingness to spend within their means, so they started monetizing their debts.  
It starts off small, it ends up destroying an entire economy if it's not stopped.  But it began with a government that spent too much and promised too much to its citizens without having a viable plan to pay for it in the long term.
To the extent that the US has economic problems, it's because we're similarly overspending and monetizing, although it's way earlier in the game for us, and we have a lot more rope before we run out than a smaller economy like Venezuela.  It has nothing to do with our currency being too valuable.  Both the US and especially Venezuela could be much better off, and more prosperous, with a currency that governments can't just inflate at will, which amounts to stealing value from all the currency that's already out there, and starts the inflationary train that, if taken too far, ends up with a situation like we see in Venezuela currently.

Milton Friedman famously explained this in one of his PBS documentaries.  Not that it should take someone like Milton Friedman explaining it for people to understand.  It's really quite obvious that the more money they create, the less the money will be worth.  And when people start losing faith in the currency entirely, it collapses even faster because people are attempting to escape in advance of future money-creation, so it essentially multiplies the effect as the market anticipates future printing and devaluation and prices them in at the present.
All it takes is for them to stop, but then they'd have a bunch of unpaid bills, debt they can't service, etc., and they'd have a whole different crisis on their hands.  Mind you, it's a crisis they will HAVE to confront for things ever to get better in Venezuela.  They have to admit they can't afford to pay their government bills, default on their debt, and lay people off/end or drastically reduce government programs/fire government workers.
It'll make things even worse in the short term, in some respects.  But certain aspects of the economy would improve pretty quickly.
Hyperinflation is a government's desperate attempt to preserve a very sick system that needs to be allowed to collapse.  The problem is that the longer and harder they try, the more collateral damage there is, and it's going to end up the same way regardless--government being forced to admit it's broke and assuming the consequences.  But the longer and harder they fight it, the worse they make the economy and the fabric of the country, before eventually, inevitably, it will end the same way.  And if they only did it sooner, things never would have had to be so bad as they are.  And if they did it today, things wouldn't have to keep getting worse to the extent that they will.
Aside from discovering a magic pile of gold, there's literally no other way this can end except default for the Venezuelan government.  Better tomorrow than next year or some other time in the future.  It will be bad, but waiting and continuing their current policy only makes it worse in the end.

Inflation doesn't come from nowhere.  Your government is creating all that extra money that's flowing in and driving down the value of the currency.  They could stop the inflation tomorrow if they just stopped creating more bolivares....but then they wouldn't have any money, since they're getting all the money they hand out to government workers, the military, police, politicians, etc. by printing it.

Might not be as long as you think.
One of the aspects pushing the market north right now might be as simple as the fact that people are less inclined to sell in 2016 if they think that by waiting till 2017, they'll wind up paying a lower tax rate (since Trump favors lower taxes and might manage to pass lower rates for 2017 through a Republican Congress).  Not to mention pushing that cap gains bill off for a whole extra year anyway.
So that's just another reason they're all thinking "hold out till January and then take profits!"  Nobody wants losses in the old year, either, ruining their end-of-year fiscal picture, and that mass psychology also factors in.
But the Fed just raised rates and look what happened a year ago: a quarter-point rate hike in December, and a January where the market had big losses early on.
Why do we think that can't happen again after this New Year?  Why do we even think the market is so enthusiastic for Trump?  Does all this exuberance have any grounding in reality?  Is he really going to do anything to improve the economy, or is the market just getting a little carried away in the absence of some of its downward pressure (as I described above) right now at the end of the year, and reality could be waiting in the wings just behind New Year's Day?
I think you might be surprised how short a while it potentially might be.  I don't know that it'll turn negative in January, because maybe the Trump Turnaround story has so much legs in the market psyche that it'll manage to keep up the good times a little longer even after Jan 1.
But it's not really based on any underlying truth.  Nothing Trump has planned should engender this much enthusiasm in the market right now, and I think this rally is based on a feeling, a hope, and a dream, and that sooner or later people are going to realize nothing is really different and reality will come crashing back into the market--perhaps literally.
(Credit to Peter Schiff who has been saying a lot of this stuff and whose thinking with regard to this issue has definitely been instrumental in shaping mine...I think Peter's wrong about Bitcoin but he's a great economic prognosticator in general.)

It's helping him to wipe out his debts; but OP would surely be far better off having to pay the full value of those debts with a stronger currency, in a Venezuela not experiencing hyperinflation, because he'd almost certainly be earning more in real terms, he'd be more able to afford food and other basic necessities, and would therefore be better able to afford his debt service, even if it were a larger amount in real terms.

Just because they're the biggest doesn't mean they're stopping anyone else from selling things online.  They're just doing the best job of it at the moment.
A monopoly is when there is no competition.  Like if you own all of a resource.  Or if you have a government-granted place in a market and nobody is legally allowed to compete (such as your power company, most likely).
It's not just when you're doing well, but others are still totally free and able to compete with you.  That's not a monopoly.

I can still see a place for banks in Bitcoin.
They'd offer an interest rate to depositors who lend them money, and they'd lend out money like mortgages and business loans, at interest.
You wouldn't use the banking system because you had to, but it could have a use, definitely.
The alternate banking system would likely provide loans that the current banking system won't make, based on alternative ways of quantifying and managing risk.  
It might not be economically viable competing against the current world banking system, especially with the huge regulatory burden.  But in the third world where the banking system pretty much just isn't there?  It could play a role.  Returns from interest would have to be commensurate with the risk people associate with that bank's activity, but still--it can and almost certainly will happen.
Banks should be a place you can invest money for a decent return, and by servicing underserved or unserved markets, I see no reason why Bitcoin banks can not exist.  But they won't be a gatekeeper.  Just an option if you want to put your coins in an account where they can earn interest.
I envision an entire banking system, successful and well-known Bitcoin banks, and even Bitcoin bank failures, of unsound banks that offered too much in returns and made bad bets and took on too much risk, in the future.
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:02:20
You are the naive one, giving absolutes like this and saying it will never happen.
Banking will exist, period.  There may be people like you who don't trust banks and never will, and you might never give a single bitcoin to a bank.  But others will.
As the bitcoin economy matures, there will be less long-term upside to simply holding bitcoin (we are talking years in the future when the price is way above where it is now, assuming bitcoin is the crypto that in fact sees the widest adoption, which I am, but that could be wrong I suppose).  The price will have stabilized at a much higher rate than today.
There will still likely be modest deflation over time as the supply of bitcoin will basically be stagnant, and the amount of use it sees would increase very gradually with population growth + economic growth, but it would be relatively stable.  Maybe it would gain a few % a year at that point in value, maybe less.
People who wanted returns on their money would loan some to an institution they trust, that has a good reputation, in exchange for a decent return, and those institutions in turn would make loans.  This aspect of banking is both valuable and necessary to an economy, and as crypto sees larger adoption, this function will eventually migrate from failing fiat currencies to trusted cryptocurrencies.
Banks in this world would not have government guarantees, though, or central bank attachments which get them cheap money created on demand to satisfy their needs.  So they'd have to be very open about their risk portfolio, they'd have to be trusted, they'd have to develop good reputations, their books would have to be available for scrutiny.  This is how they'd win the trust of a marketplace.
People (not everyone, mind you, but some people) would choose to lend these institutions money, and would get a return on their investment.  Not everyone wants to go to all the trouble of assessing risk and making loans on their own personally.  That's a lot of work and people aren't all experts at it.  Someone has to be in this business, and it's a valuable business, both to the depositors/creditors who can gain a return on money loaned, and to borrowers.
Lacking the power of government money on demand behind them, these banks would not have the power and stranglehold on the economy that the current banking system does in the US, and they would surely be a smaller share of the economy.  But that doesn't change the fact that the service they offer is necessary in an economy and people will demand it.
You may never trust banks, but they will have a place.  But the place will be for depositors who get returns, and for borrowers who want to borrow money, and NOT for people needing the banking infrastructure just to be able to use their money, which of course the existence of cryptos negates.  It would merely be for the function of being an institution that offers loans and pays creditors interest, and there could be various kinds of banks specializing in various areas with widely varying risk portfolios and % returns offered.
Banking arose because there's a demand for it, and it wasn't originally as a payment system, and it wasn't only as a place your money is kept secure.  It was as specialists in loaning money to good credit risks, and paying creditors who lend them money some of what they make, while keeping some for themselves.
This function will ALWAYS be in demand to some extent.  Right now, all that demand is in the regular fiat economy, but as ways of servicing that demand are created for cryptos that either are in keeping with the laws, or that simply circumvent them, come into play, there WILL be a role for banking.
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:23:05
As long as there are people who want to borrow money, there will be specialists in lending it, period.  And there will be people who loan them money to make a profit.
I don't care if you like it, and I don't have to convince you.  It will happen even as you deny its possibility.  It won't be the current zombie banking system that operates under fiat money with the support of central banking, but it will exist.
Sorry you don't like it, but just like cryptocurrency itself, it can't be stopped.  Where there's demand, someone will fill that need, and there will be demand for loaned money, which will create a market in specialists for assessing that risk.
You could just as easily be arguing that whatever newest, greatest next-gen media that isn't even here yet won't ever have porn on it.  I don't need to even know what it is to say that it will.  There's demand, so someone will fill that role.  This is the same.

I'm not sure what you think that proves.  It's really hard to draw a corollary from the existence of homeless people in our society, to the idea that nobody will ever demand any services offered by banks under a cryptocurrency system.  One does not follow the other at all.  This isn't really an argument against what I'm saying.
Certainly I agree that central banking and their terrible management of, essentially, the price of money for our entire socity, is largely responsible for widespread poverty and for our falling standard of living, and plays a large role in those people being homeless.
That's different from banking in general, which is currently wrapped up with the bad stuff but doesn't necessarily have to be.  Banking in general is a useful service; the banking sector in this country, starting at the top, is out of control and is ruining our country, but once the power of controlling the money supply is our of their hands, a healthy and better banking system should and will exist.

All Bernanke and Summers know is that they see something that has a trend behind it, that might grow in importance, so they'll be on record as saying it has promise, or the potential to be important.

I don't think investing in mortgage backed securities is the same as what Madoff did.
Not by a long shot.
People seem to think the housing bust was the fault of the banks, but this is false.  The banks were fooled like everyone else.  Now they may have done some bad shit once they realized they were in trouble on these investments to try and hide the losses, before it was obvious that it couldn't be hidden since the problems were so huge.  But that's not what caused it.
It was caused by the Federal Reserve.  They lowered interest rates too far, it inflated a housing bubble, and then they raised rates.  It took a little while for the effect of those hiked rates to hit, but it ultimately meant the bubble had to pop.  And then it did.
Here's the upshot, though: how did the Fed combat the recession that followed?  *By lowering rates even further, for even longer.*
We're in the middle of another massive bubble inflated by the Fed, right now.  The banks are as clueless as everyone else about this.  But I'm sure when this bubble ends in recession and ruin, that people will once again blame the individual banks and actors on Wall Street, instead of realizing that the Federal Reserve caused this problem--just like they did the last one, and the one before that.

Banks are going to be decimated even sooner by a tanking economy, which has already begun.  The repeat of 2008 is right around the corner unless the Fed ramps up QE again. 
(Not that I am supporting this policy of more QE--it's a temporary solution that exacerbates the underlying problems--but it's all the Fed knows how to do and they'd be damned before they'd let a recession actually run its course and proper restructuring of the economy occur by letting banks fail).

Politicians don't like bitcoin.  Why will the world stick to their fiat money, which they can steal value from by creating more, at your expense, for their own purposes, at will, when it can have sound money?
What they need is to paint it as fringe, and crack down where possible, to keep their money as the main thing.
Never mind that the main cause of long term systemic economic problems today involves their constantly inflating currencies.  They don't understand this, but even if they did I don't know that they'd care.

I don't know.  Why does the model of buy and hold have to be smart for cryptos to succeed?
Might be that they're a better short-term play, and medium of exchange, than they are a place to park your wealth in the hope of getting rich.
But even then, just because bitcoin, the first and not the best technologically because others have improved on it, isn't the one that winds up on top, doesn't mean another one couldn't gain top spot and keep it more than 5 years.
Your whole rationale seems to be : bitcoin was first so it has to lead the crypto market and will never be abandoned.  And you don't have any real reason to assume this will be true forever, especially when some of the others have improved on some of bitcoin's shortcomings.
That's like saying the Model T should have ruled the auto market forever even when better cars came along.  I don't see why.  The only thing I can think is that you have too much invested, financially and emotionally, in bitcoin to allow you to countenance any world where it doesn't stay on top forever.

Gold is gold.  It was backed by the alternative uses of gold, aside from as money.  It was desirable already as a metal, before people used it as money.
Now what Bitcoin and gold both share is scarcity.  Nobody can simply create more at will.  There's a finite amount, it gets harder and harder to find more of it and bring new supply in.
They both have other characteristics of money.  Bitcoin is the most fungible form of money there ever has been.  Gold is the safest store of value, though--civilization could crash and burn, taking the Internet and the entire blockchain with it, and gold would still be valuable.
That said, civilization and the internet aren't going to crash and burn anytime soon, so I say Bitcoin, due to its extreme usefulness and fungibility, is going to grow.

Bitcoin won't fail in a vacuum.  It'll fail because other cryptos have surpassed it, while market cap of cryptos has continued to grow.
And it might not disappear completely or go to zero.  But it'll own less and less of the market, get overtaken, and become more and more obscure.
This won't happen tomorrow.  Bitcoin will hold its lead for a while.  But it will happen.

The Fed is really part of the government, actually.  They are appointed by the government, they cooperate with the rest of the government.  The ONLY reason they aren't considered officially part of the government, is because to give the government the powers vested in the Fed would have been unconstitutional--so they did an end-run around the Constitution by proclaiming it an independent bank.
But in practice, in all but name, it's not.  Its independence is a fiction.  It's part of the government just as much as any foreign central bank is.  They just used the "not part of the government" angle to circumvent the Supreme Law of the Land.  Still blatantly unconstitutional, in my opinion, but I guess they managed to fool the Supreme Court.

Why is bitcoin the best crypto?  Just because it was first?
Others that are technologically better will eclipse bitcoin.  The entire market cap of cryptos is going way up, and maybe bitcoin will lead that charge for a while.  But that doesn't mean Bitcoin is going to have all the gains, or even stay in the lead.
If I were a heavy bitcoin investor, I'd be thinking about at least hedging my bets.

I don't think fiat currencies necessarily must fail when inflation drops below zero.  They just won't allow that to happen because they *believe* it's a catastrophe.  It certainly would mean a restructuring of the economy, and a very severe recession, but some parts of the economy would immediately benefit, and the growth would be substantial and make up for any losses in a relatively short period of time.
The problem is you can't get them to set up circumstances that will cause deflation.  They have too much incentive for money creation.  And the Federal government likely *would* have to cave at this point and default, because they cannot sustain higher interest rates--which is the unspoken reason why the Fed is under such pressure not to raise them, in addition to their insane belief that keeping rates this low is good for the market.
But Volcker managed to whip inflation during his tenure, so it can be done.  But it was done at a time when the US government could afford to pay higher interest on its debt and hadn't reached such a high debt/GDP ratio.  Not sure it could be done now.  But luckily, we'll get to find out, because a dollar crisis is coming, and when it does, the inflation we're told isn't a problem will come home to roost.

I certainly would not say BTC is better than gold.  It's different than gold.  Gold is 100% completely secure, in that nobody can counterfeit it, and nobody can compromise it on a network level.  You can steal gold from individuals.  You can produce it (find, mine, and smelt it) with great effort and expense, in small amounts.  It is not reliant on anything, including the internet and even civilization and electricity.
BTC runs on a platform that includes the continued existence of worldwide networking.  It is believed secure, but obviously can be compromised more easily than gold can be on a systemic level (this doesn't mean it can be done easily--just that alchemy is impossible).
But BTC has useful attributes that gold doesn't, especially its extreme fungibility across the entire world to anyone with minimal effort and apparently, at this point, very limited ability of anyone to prevent it.
When you have a giant pile of gold, you run risks associated with physical security.  When you have a giant pile of BTC, you have to be at least minorly concerned with possible vulnerabilities in the entire BTC system.
They carry different risks and benefits, but one thing is common to both: they are outside of the ability of a central bank or government to print (assuming system security on the part of BTC).  Therefore they will not be inflated in the future in unpredictable ways.

There was, on the whole, deflation throughout the 19th century.  The idea of over the course of a century, losing 98% of your money's purchasing power, was unheard of.
Contrast that with--well, 1913 to present, where we've lost that much of our money's value under the Federal Reserve.
I think, and so do the economists that I think make the best sense and have the most logical, and predictive theories, that economies do better, all other things being equal, under a currency of stable supply.

I do think it has been claimed the post WWII period could be given this title--I think such claims are quite blatantly wrong.
When you think of the obvious difference of standard of living between 1800 and 1900, and also the amount the population grew, it is clear that the economy grew by a great larger relative amount in that century, than when you compare it to the subsequent century and the change in standard of living we experienced--although I would say the period of rapid economic growth continued, with a few hiccups and plateaus, into the 20's.
You could possibly isolate a few year period like maybe right after the war and show that it had a quicker period of economic growth than any comparable period of equal length in the 19th century.  I could believe that.  But that would be a short burst associated with the end of the war, not a sustained long-term economic expansion on the level such as was experienced pretty much throughout the entirety of the 19th century (with some harsh contractions).

Inflation can frontload a little bit of demand because people will think they should buy before prices go up.  This much is true.  But on the whole it depresses demand.  Even if a few more people buy washing machines a little sooner, on the whole, fewer people will be able to afford and buy washing machines going forward.
These days, the economic theories that are in vogue and are exercised at the highest levels such as at the Federal Reserve and at foreign central banks such as in Japan, are ass backwards because they always think merely about short term implications and because they misunderstand the relationship of different economic factors--like believing that devaluing their currency will help their export market and balance of trade, for example (which, of course, it doesn't really do at all).
The greatest economic growth has always taken place under stable currencies.  A modestly deflating currency, which Bitcoin will be, once it comes into its own and is used more widely, is the best possible platform for economic growth.  Inflation is only good for the person who is the beneficiary of the created money; for everyone else, and economy as a whole, it's a net negative.

These are imitations but not true replications.  You cannot create actual gold, is what I mean, or at least not cost-effectively in quantity (I have no idea but perhaps they can make a few molecules of it in an atom smasher)
Sure, I can fool you into buying something that's not gold but that's true of anything.  I could sell you a fake Rolex, too.  If you're an astute and careful buyer and don't buy stuff that's not actually gold, you're fine.
As for asteroid mining--sure, one day we may find a shit ton of gold out there and start bringing it back to Earth.  It's nowhere close to happening yet, it's only theoretical.  If this ever happens, it will not be sudden and out of the blue.  There will be many steps between now, and this becoming a reality.
But also it's quite likely that gold is as scarce out in the universe as it is here.  Sure, there are likely to be some chunks of gold out there but they will probably be relatively rare and hard to find, even out in space.  I doubt we'll come across a giant asteroid that's just got so much gold as to entirely inflate the market on Earth at one fell swoop.  Possible, but unlikely.
