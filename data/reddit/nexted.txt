Do you really think that none of those things would happen to literally any service like Coinbase hosted inside of the U.S.? This is a regulatory problem in the country, not an issue with Coinbase specifically. The only companies operating here who haven't had to deal with similar issues have simply not become large enough to become a target. It will happen.
You should expect this will happen to any exchange that converts fiat into crypto and plan to move your money out accordingly if you require additional financial privacy. It's still a hell of a lot better than using a traditional payment provider, with a few minimal precautions.
As far as the investors: what's your point? Plenty of crooked people invest in plenty of interesting companies. Are they running operations at the company? Do they have board seats?
Also, partnering with banks? How else do you expect Coinbase to actually serve customers looking to acquire Bitcoin? You can't operate a service like Coinbase *without dealing with banks*.
Your post is not evidence of a problem with Coinbase specifically as a company. Your post is evidence of problems with the traditional financial system, and at this point, it's more or less a necessary evil we need to help Bitcoin grow and flourish.

You have to be blind to think that an average person will jump through those hoops. You need it to be easier and frictionless. You can't achieve that without easy gateways to the traditional financial system in the intermediate term.

Well, it's the same history until a supermajority of hash power triggers the fork. ;)
@_date: 2015-12-27 09:01:18


Perhaps you misunderstood. I meant that miners vote with their feet by using a pool which uses a fork of Bitcoin they agree with. If no one likes BIP101/XT, then you shouldn't be concerned about the forking change taking effect, since it requires a supermajority of hash power.


Is there data to suggest that a majority of hash power is owned by one or more mining companies directly?


Your logic is a bit circular. You can't respond to my criticism about distributed consensus by hand-waving about "invalid blocks". My point is that the majority in a distributed consensus system should probably define the system and determine what is valid.

A few people have made it toxic and/or dangerous to even discuss or voice an opinion, especially as a large player in the space. How can you even achieve a majority consensus when you'll block discussion and start blacklisting anyone who disagrees, like was done with Coinbase here?

Considering I don't really support BIP101, I'm not sure that you can accurately call me a "sucker". Attacks certainly don't lend your argument any additional credibility.
The problem is the censorship. How can anyone even publicly state their support for an alternative when they'll be shut out of the discussion and blacklisted, as was done with Coinbase here? Your current "consensus" around "not BIP101" seems to be through force, not dialogue.

If enough miners are willing to continue using pools that support a particular fork, then yes, it certainly does. You make it sound as though the entirety of the hash power of those pools belongs to them and that it's fully under their control. Miners vote with their feet.

Haha. Is that why Theymos had to block all discussion here and disable comment scores? If the community was on board, it seems strange that such lengths to censor the discussion are taking place to hide the widespread disagreement with the current "consensus".
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:44:59


Your argument sounds a bit like a slippery slope fallacy. Accepting BIP101 discussion here, which is a scaling fork, does not mean that the sub is obligated to accept discussion of forks which alter the fundamental economic promise to users.


Even amongst those who disapprove of BIP101, there's hardly a majority who consider BIP101 an outright "attack". That's simply a rhetorical tool to gain sympathy, and that sort of manipulation, in conjunction with censorship, strikes at the heart of why folks are so up in arms about how this topic has been handled in Theymos-controlled forums.


I think the fundamental issue here is that it ignores the fact that *inaction is itself an action*. By failing to make meaningful progress on scaling, we're making a decision to continue with the current limitations without actually coming to a consensus on it.


The clearest way to signal your support of an idea is to take an action. When a few people are controlling the discussion, it's far more effective to let code talk. This is why running XT nodes isn't an "attack": it's a vote. Only once a hash supermajority and an economic majority get onboard will it really take effect.
This is what Coinbase is doing: they're signalling that they'll go along with the majority if and/or when it comes to that and BIP101 takes effect. They can't actually make the change in isolation.

Interestingly enough, for merchants which *do* accept Bitcoin, it's actually far easier to use internationally.
Especially as an American, I get hassled in countries with chip and pin credit card systems, since my card doesn't support it. Oh, forget to call your bank? ATM card is now deactivated.
My biggest fear while traveling is somehow losing my cards/cash/identification. With Bitcoin, I have some contingencies to get access to a wallet with some emergency funds. I just need access to a phone or computer for a few minutes, then I can find an ATM and get fiat (or use it directly, which will hopefully be more commonplace soon).

Which is great, actually, since most people are afraid to run as exit nodes. Since the foundational assumption of Tor is that exit nodes are not to be trusted, then it shouldn't matter whether they're operated by the US government or volunteers.* The US government is capable of performing traffic analysis on clear Internet traffic anyway via direct access to backbone infrastructure in the country, so we may as well benefit.
\* This doesn't apply to the Tor network as a whole. If the US government makes up a substantial chunk of the network (and not just exits), then that poses a threat due to the possibility for circuit de-anonymization.

Has his opinion changed at all, as the infrastructure has matured?
Most of his comments around a deflationary currency being bad for the economy are kind of moot, since the fundamental problem is that *bitcoin doesn't care if it's bad* and *people don't individually care*. If it's useful and valuable, people will buy it and use it.
Hell, we could end up in a world where Bitcoin is widely used and it's a terrible thing for everyone, and we learn the hard way that deflation is indeed the devil. But is that going to stop adoption? Are people, who are inherently selfish actors looking out for their own interests, going to be repelled by a currency which tends to gain value? 
No, of course not. People *like* when their money gains value. if the price indeed continues to rise for years, people will be drawn to it for that very reason, even if in the end it's bad for everyone.

Random neat idea: create a meta tag or similar to embed on web pages and contains a payment address. Your browser has built in functionality so that you can effortlessly tip a small amount for the page you're currently on.
You could set the default to something incredibly tiny, like a fraction of a cent at the current exchange rate, so that you don't even think about it and can just compulsively +1 good content. Cumulatively, it could add up for popular content.
A million tips on a popular video at half a cent is $5k, for example.

Here's his full original response in the thread:
Hi all. My name is Jordan Kelley and I am the CEO of Robocoin. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the facts, and share, simply the reality of the relationship with Andrew and Robocoin. 
To date: Robocoin has shipped units to 18 countries. We are helping to fascilitate the buys and sells of bitcoin in 14 currencies. The following is a disappointing story of a disgruntled, impatient buyer:
1. Andrew bought a Robocoin kiosk. 
2. Shipment was delayed, something that happens in hardware, especially with a brand new company trying to satisfy enormous demand. It was out of our control. The new polymer Canadian notes that have a huge clear window through them would be rejected by Fujitsu's bill dispenser. We had to wait for Fujitstu to finish an update. It was something that I truly hated (I'm a guy who wants to make everyone happy), but we still attempted to communicate every step of the way. 
3. We delivered the kiosk. Andrew took receipt of the unit. 
4. The kiosk had some hardware failures. My support team worked with them every step of the way. We spent hours on hours working on solutions. My support team, dedicated to their job, was met with constant belittlement and noncooperation from Andrew. 
5. Andrew lost patience and decided he was over it. He shipped the kiosk back to Robocoin's manufacturer. 
6. He then demanded a full refund after the kiosk was delivered, worked on and ready for the fix that would have put him right back in business. 
7. Robocoin has a restocking fee and Andrew refused to agree to the restocking fee - claiming that he was due a full refund. The contract states, explicitly, that Robocoin does not offer refunds. 
8. Andrew would not come to any type of terms. He chose to threaten as opposed to negote. We offered to resell the unit - he declined. That is not the kind of way we like to do business. 
9. He sent out a horrible tweet - saying that I'm crooked. Something I take personal offense to. Again - we delivered his kiosk, we provided him support. We did our part and we're ready and willing to go above and beyond. 
10. I am always happy to come to a swift and easy resolution. It's disappointing that business is conducted this way and even more disappointing that my company - a team that works every day, tirelessly to the bone, to develop great solutions to enable the world to buy bitcoin - is dragged through the muck. 
I take personal responsibility on this. This is 100% on me. I failed to get Andrew's kiosk in working order, unlike the other 65 out an live in the world. I failed to solve Andrew's problems. 
Our team continues to launch kiosks all over the world. We continue to execute on making amazing solutions for the bitcoin world and will never stop.

Seriously though, a service like SendGame could never work with PayPal. A Steam purchase cannot be refunded, so a chargeback from a user would effectively put it in the hole. The bot would have to increase fees to counter fraud and the bot operator would have to spend time dealing with dispute resolution, figuring out how much fraud is costing them and increasing their fee, etc. It would require work.
Compare that to this bot, which pretty much can just be set up and left to run with no real concern for fraud at all.

For what it's worth as someone who has been involved with Bitcoin in some capacity since about 2011, and who has built applications on top of it, I'm actually not concerned about scaling. As long as we don't need to hit Visa scale for at least five years or so, we should be fine.
Regardless, the absolute worst case scalability scenario involves the Bitcoin blockchain becoming essentially a financial clearing house, with other side chains being used for day to day transactions, microtransactions, etc. Work would be needed to make this transparent for consumer wallets. There are many avenues, and the work being done to include information on the UTXO in the header will make it easier for lightweight clients in the near term, so long as the UTXO set is manageable.


At the moment, I tend to agree. I think most directly consumer impacting benefits won't be realized until we achieve more growth.


Fair, but we see the inverse from other investors, such as Andreesen here. Opinion actually seems to vary rather significantly. I disagree with your assertion that it's more technical actors, though.
The tech money folks seem to be leaning toward Bitcoin-positive, whereas the traditional financial guys like Buffet lean the other way. I have no idea whether that's good or bad, just that it seems to be the state of things.

There's a hugely significant difference. No two alt chains are made of two divergent paths of what used to be one common chain.
Let's say BTC forks into BGF (BTC Gox Fork) and BPC (BTC Pure Chain). Your coins would be spendable on *both* chains after the fork.
If both continue to exist, confidence will drop. What if it forks into four? Eight?

Their argument is unrelated. The IBLT change would allow blocks to propagate in the same amount of time, regardless of size (and thus, regardless of the number of included transactions). IBLT thus helps to **incentivize miners to include transactions up to the block size limit** (and beyond, in the future).
In fact, the folks behind that site are probably *against* the IBLT change precisely because it lowers the barrier to larger blocks, which they're concerned will cause centralization due to storage, bandwidth, and CPU requirements increasing from additional transaction volume.
TL;DR: The IBLT proposal doesn't solve the problems that keepbitcoinfree.org is concerned about, but actually exacerbates them.
@_date: 2014-10-11 04:57:58
At least look at it as a stepping stone. For the large number of individuals without access to bank accounts, Bitcoin could be tremendously useful, but the volatility means that they would be foolish to put a significant amount of their wealth in it.
Services like these solve the problem for now while Bitcoin is young. Years down the road as the market grows and volatility decreases, they will be less useful.
TL;DR: We should be willing to compromise in the name of bootstrapping Bitcoin. :)

Sort of. I believe diskiller is proposing that a code fix could be deployed and adopted by the majority hash power which would specifically add an exception for that one transaction and restore ownership to MtGox.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is a piece of software with an algorithm governing how the chain is structured. Those rules *can* be changed, but the change needs consensus of the majority of miners to be adopted. It has happened in the past that newer builds have changed the rules of what makes a valid chain (both intentionally and unintentionally).

Companies in the U.S. don't really have a choice. Please tell me where I can find a company in the U.S. which will link my U.S. bank account and allow me to purchase BTC.
Services like Coinbase are an absolute necessity *for now*. Could we live in a world in the future where that's not the case? Perhaps. But for now, we need a way to bootstrap the Bitcoin economy and we can't do that without Coinbase, Circle, and other gateways between the existing financial system and the crypto economy.
Can you and I purchase coins anonymously? Sure. Does the average person want to hang out in IRC, or meet people through Local Bitcoins? No, not at all. Can we live in a world with widespread use of Bitcoin without those people? No, not likely.
The real solution is to find ways to allow users to detach themselves from their coins after they convert at a gateway.
For example, a sidechain which implements ZeroCoin for massive coin anonymization. Then, the government can have all the AML/KYC data they want, but the trail will disconnect very quickly. ;)
TL;DR: Necessary evils are necessary.

The payout would be the same over time. If you moved from ten minute blocks to one minute blocks, you would necessarily need to divide the coinbase by ten to maintain the same rate of coin distribution.
You will find that the overwhelming majority of the community would be against not maintaining the current coin distribution rate and 21M coin cap. Leaving the reward as is and decreasing block solution times would be *significantly* more controversial.

It seems like Bitcoin's future is pretty binary. It will either continue to grow and succeed in being a useful currency for (at least) online payments. Or, it will fail. There's not a lot of middle ground. I believe Satoshi himself has said as much.
In the event of success, the limited supply of BTC will force a significant increase in price over the adoption period.
Assuming long term success, keep in mind that 21 million BTC at $10kUSD/BTC is $210 billion USD.

Actually, miners can (and do) set their own policies for which transactions to include in blocks they mine. They can require massive fees, or blacklist certain addresses, etc. The consensus model ensures that this can't outright stop transactions unless all miners apply the same policy.
Interestingly enough, most of these blacklist targets could easily avoid the issue by not using vanity addresses or specific burn addresses.

Here's his deleted comment, since I can't reply to it now:
Hi all. My name is Jordan Kelley and I am the CEO of Robocoin. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the facts, and share, simply the reality of the relationship with Andrew and Robocoin. 
To date: Robocoin has shipped units to 18 countries. We are helping to fascilitate the buys and sells of bitcoin in 14 currencies. The following is a disappointing story of a disgruntled, impatient buyer:
1. Andrew bought a Robocoin kiosk. 
2. Shipment was delayed, something that happens in hardware, especially with a brand new company trying to satisfy enormous demand. It was out of our control. The new polymer Canadian notes that have a huge clear window through them would be rejected by Fujitsu's bill dispenser. We had to wait for Fujitstu to finish an update. It was something that I truly hated (I'm a guy who wants to make everyone happy), but we still attempted to communicate every step of the way. 
3. We delivered the kiosk. Andrew took receipt of the unit. 
4. The kiosk had some hardware failures. My support team worked with them every step of the way. We spent hours on hours working on solutions. My support team, dedicated to their job, was met with constant belittlement and noncooperation from Andrew. 
5. Andrew lost patience and decided he was over it. He shipped the kiosk back to Robocoin's manufacturer. 
6. He then demanded a full refund after the kiosk was delivered, worked on and ready for the fix that would have put him right back in business. 
7. Robocoin has a restocking fee and Andrew refused to agree to the restocking fee - claiming that he was due a full refund. The contract states, explicitly, that Robocoin does not offer refunds. 
8. Andrew would not come to any type of terms. He chose to threaten as opposed to negote. We offered to resell the unit - he declined. That is not the kind of way we like to do business. 
9. He sent out a horrible tweet - saying that I'm crooked. Something I take personal offense to. Again - we delivered his kiosk, we provided him support. We did our part and we're ready and willing to go above and beyond. 
10. I am always happy to come to a swift and easy resolution. It's disappointing that business is conducted this way and even more disappointing that my company - a team that works every day, tirelessly to the bone, to develop great solutions to enable the world to buy bitcoin - is dragged through the muck. 
I take personal responsibility on this. This is 100% on me. I failed to get Andrew's kiosk in working order, unlike the other 65 out an live in the world. I failed to solve Andrew's problems. 
Our team continues to launch kiosks all over the world. We continue to execute on making amazing solutions for the bitcoin world and will never stop.

The blockchain is a decentralized database. The value is that it prevents any one party from deciding how commits are made to it.
A centralized blockchain is redundant. You may as well spin up a MySQL instance and build yourself a web service with a SendMoney and ReceiveMoney API. No need to burn resources on mining when you intend to control everything.
Thought experiment: why do people have concern over mining centralization and the possibility of a 51% attack? Because a person with 51% of the hash power can now create every new block and control the blockchain.

Just to clarify: if this is a more or less standard implementation of BitTorrent (or something similar to it), then this won't help.
I was envisioning something along the lines of Freenet/Storj, where users can seek out files, but the people storing the files aren't aware of what they have. You pay a fee to store the files, or insert them for free and let users pay to download them. Something along those lines.
In that situation, there's actually not even a way to issue a takedown. With Freenet, for example, a file can be fragmented across hundreds of peers, where each peer has just a small chunk of the actual data.

You may want to take a look at the way that Freenet implements this, since it offers plausible deniability to users who contribute disk space.

That is pretty rad, and a major step in the direction of having stupidly fast and censorship-resistant file sharing.
It seems like the big piece to get right is the incentive model. If it relies on the uploader to continue to pay for and support, then that doesn't seem sustainable.
For example, most BitTorrent trackers tend to be initially seeded by a small group of individuals. It's true of all content sources, for the most part. YouTube has a small group who provide the content which gets the most views. Most users are consumers.
If you can get leechers to pay and remove the burden from uploaders (at least beyond some initial insertion/maintenance cost until something becomes popular), then it could be incredibly interesting. 
Add in kickbacks to the original uploader to create incentive to share and broadcast.. Anyway, I look forward to seeing what you guys come up with. :)

This will be much easier to do in a world with wide cryptocurrency adoption. How can we even begin to convince them to use privacy-centric services when they can't spend their money most places?
Plus, services like Coinbase existing for non-privacy minded folks benefits you because it increases the utility of your coins and improves *your* ability to protect your financial privacy.

Edit: But generally, do you really not think that, over a short window of time, that what people spend in bitcoin doesn't influence how much they buy? I tend to buy a fixed amount every two weeks. If I spend some BTC during the prior two weeks, that tends to factor into how much I buy at that time (ie, I want to save at least $100 every two weeks in BTC, so if I spent $50 in it the previous week, I'll buy $150 worth then).

This has nothing to do with a 51% attack.
I'm not arguing that diskiller's proposal is good, but it is possible.
The foundation could reach out to the large mining pools and see if there was consensus to add a hack to the client to restore ownership of those coins. If there was significant consensus, they would identify a block for the change to take effect in the future and release the build.
The community would choose whether to adopt the build or not. If the majority decides to, then the minority would essentially be forced to switch over or risk continuing to mine a chain that the community has collectively agreed is no longer the "true chain".
That's the fascinating thing about Bitcoin. Sure, it's governed by math/rules, but those rules are determined by the community and written into the Bitcoin codebase. The rules are agreed to based on what has wide adoption and acceptance. It's not like we haven't had hard forks in the past.

The problem is that doesn't seem to recognize that there's no consensus to *stay the course* at a 1MB block size. Inaction *is itself an action*, and arguing that we shouldn't change anything without "consensus" (where consensus is defined as consensus amongst the largest contributors to Core, who theymos is friends with, and ignores all others) is ignoring this very important point.
In fact, from what I've seen, if we break everyone into two groups, those who want the block size to stay at 1MB, and those who want *some sort of increase*, then the latter camp has far more supporters. Consensus amongst users, miners, companies, and even developers seems to be to *do something*, even if they haven't 100% agreed on what that something is. Even luke-jr seems to think the block size should change (just, comically, in the other direction).
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:25:17
Theymos defines an altcoin as any Bitcoin fork which isn't approved by his friends involved with Core.
Just kidding. He actually defines it as any fork without consensus, but conveniently leaves out the fact that he stifles discussion so prematurely that consensus is unable to be developed (such as by blocking Bitcoin Classic discussion by calling it an "altcoin").
How the hell can a proposal go from ideation to achieving consensus if you shutdown discussion from the outset by calling it an altcoin? Any fork not proposed by one of the handful of people involved with Core *could never stand a chance*.
It's ludicrous and he damn well knows it, but I suspect he genuinely believes his friends know what's best and is using his power to promote their ideas.
@_date: 2016-01-12 07:24:40


Unfortunately, if this came to be, the answer would not be so simple. If 90% of the hashpower really believes this, you may not have a choice. If they're organized, then they can simply choose to commit hashpower towards blocking transactions on the original chain and make Bitcoin entirely useless except on *their* chain. They allocate 20% to perform a 51% attack against the remaining 10%, and then allocate their remaining 70% towards building on their chain with their rules.
The reality, however, is that it's not in the economic interest of the miners to play that sort of game. If they own most of the hashpower, they want to preserve scarcity and then rake in the cash.
This is why I think your line of thinking is naive. There's actually pressure to expand the block size to increase Bitcoin's utility and value. Folks want to alter the consensus rules because they believe it's necessary to preserve the value of their investments, which is the very same economic pressure which prevents changing the consensus rules to increase the block reward.

That seems a bit inverted. Large purchases like through Airbnb are typically the ones where one *wants* the assurances and benefits that a credit card provides, from a consumer perspective. Buying a donut is the typical cash transaction where one doesn't really need that.
So Bitcoin is only useful for the type of purchases where it's actually the least beneficial these days. :\
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:28:34




Right back at you, I guess? I made no statement about whether the ability to chargeback is *objectively* better. I said that for amounts of such little value that consumers do not actively consider it. Many consumers continue to waive that chargeback ability by buying a cup of coffee with cash, in spite of the credit card sitting in their wallet.


Just to make it easy on you, how about we create a really simple situation for you to address. Let's use Airbnb. I book a hotel for $500 USD, payable alternatively in BTC. Can you explain how I'm paying a premium to use my credit card in this scenario?
You can ignore CC rewards in your scenario. Just, please explain how *as a consumer* I'm paying more by using a credit card?


Fair enough, I suppose. Perhaps you should simply move along when you see comments which frustrate you, rather than contributing toxicity to the discussion and scaring away what might be new, excited Bitcoin community members?

If you were making a stand to preserve the aspects of Bitcoin that were considered immutable: the fixed monetary supply, for example, I would understand.
But the block size is not one of these things, and has indeed been different in the past. I happen to think that loosening the restriction is worthwhile, with precedent, and has broad industry and user consensus.
You are obviously welcome to run whichever code you please, but it's disingenuous to call it an "attack".
What is to differentiate a consensus change like SegWit (or the original change to limit the block size) from an increase to 2MB which makes the latter only an "attack"?

Redditor for two years? I'm pretty sure this debate has been going on for almost that long already. :)

Most consumers don't actually *think* about this until the sum of the transaction is high enough that they would be concerned of adverse material impact. A coffee hardly warrants such thought, but a $1200 hotel fee would, for most individuals.


And no seller can really build a viable business, at least today, on accepting only Bitcoin. Thus, consumers have the freedom to choose between credit cards and Bitcoin. For large purchases, the equivalent of pushing a wad of cash over the internet may give many pause. Paying a fee/convenience premium on top of that? It seems even more questionable.
Ironically, the thing Bitcoin is least (currently) suited to, microtransactions, are the financial problem most in need of a solution (arguably).


I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2010-2011 and developed one of the first prototype web-based deterministic wallets (half a decade ago now).
Just because the zeitgeist of this sub suggests that some things are fact, does not necessarily mean that they are, nor that the majority of folks are bought into them (even if they are large supporters of Bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:39:46
Uh, again, is referring to the consumer perspective.
VISA is profitable because it *appears* to cost nothing to consumers, but offers convenience. The cost certainly does get passed along to consumers *indirectly* in the form of higher prices because the *merchants* pay the fees.
But, one cannot simply stop there and say "Ahah, I knew you were paying a premium!" because Bitcoin-paying customers are paying *the exact same premium*. Unless a merchant offers an explicit discount for paying with BTC, then you're not only paying the credit card subsidy and getting none of the advantages, but you're *also* paying BTC transaction fees.
This is part of why the payment structure for Visa is so brilliant. Even if you pay for goods with cash, you're still paying the Visa tax. You just don't derive any benefit from it (and in the case of BTC, pay even more on top).
@_date: 2016-12-27 05:43:32


Except that merchants have been capable of doing this with cash and most still opt not to do so, with the exception of gas stations.
Almost no merchant of any significant notoriety who accepts Bitcoin is offering discounts for using it today. So until that situation changes, yes, consumers are effectively paying a premium to pay with Bitcoin.
Unless you can name some at least one prominent example of a merchant offering a BTC discount?

I suppose if you only selectively quote my response? Answer this directly: do you think consumers care about consumer protection for a cup of coffee? Because that doesn't seem unreasonable to me, and you've failed to prove otherwise.


Hold on: what exactly are you saying here? Are you suggesting that by using a credit card that you're paying a *premium*? It's precisely the opposite. You're paying a premium to use Bitcoin. Merchants eat CC fees. They do not eat BTC transaction fees.
We're not talking about a hypothetical future in which BTC is a much more widely adopted currency. We're talking about the state of the world *today*.


Is the attitude quite necessary? You can't pretend to be excited about educating supposed newbies in earnest and simultaneously act like a condescending jerk without coming across as nothing but a troll.

The ledger is, as the name implies, just a balance sheet. Let's say you have 1 bitcoin at an address. That ledger has an entry which reflects that this single bitcoin resides at this address, which is only spendable by your private key which is associated with that address.
The "value" is just, at a high level, a number on this global balance sheet that all Bitcoin nodes in the world keep a copy of. You don't own/hold it in a physical sense, but you control the keys that allow you to transfer (spend) it to another person/address.
If you were to lose or destroy those keys, then you no longer have the power to spend it. Thus, it will simply live on that ledger forever and be unable to spent by any other person.

As the founder of one of the oldest operating mining pools, perhaps he might have more experience with the mining hardware ecosystem than a protocol developer, particularly given his firmware development expertise as the CEO and developer of the first hardware wallet?

The block size doesn't alter a fundamental aspect of the unit of account.


Do you actually understand how Bitcoin works, or how that event was handled?
No changes to the protocol were made, and the developers ultimately had no authority to fix anything. They brought together a majority of miners and then held a discussion to achieve *consensus* (the thing on which Bitcoin is fundamentally built) to get miners to contribute resources to a particular fork.
Even the miners on the agreed upon fork couldn't change anything right away. It took some time for their fork to build up enough proof of work to become the main chain.
@_date: 2015-04-27 05:04:47
The miner can opt not to announce a block solution with an undesirable outcome.
I suppose in theory this isn't an issue unless there's collusion amongst miners. "Hey pal, if you find a block solution meeting these criteria, I'll pay you not to announce."
There's not as much of an incentive to avoid collusion in this scenario like there is with standard mining since the collusion doesn't threaten the security/faith in the chain, and thus doesn't risk their investment (in coins, hardware, etc). Block withholding to scam an on-chain lottery isn't going to cause that loss of value, since users of the currency don't care about some guy's lottery.

Here's a quick excerpt I dug up, since I can't find the original article I read this in:

It's sort of ironic that the one thing that made Litecoin novel was effectively destroyed by its own success. If Litecoin were actually still practical to mine with a CPU (or even a GPU), it might still be interesting.

Why do you think that is? Do you believe gold isn't worth investing in because so many people have already mined most of the planet's gold and are holding it?
In spite of early adopters of gold benefiting tremendously, we still see its value rising. This is in spite of numerous large entities, such as the U.S. Treasury, locking away their massive gold reserves and never letting them be seen.
That's how a deflationary currency works. As the market expands, the finite currency becomes more valuable.
As an example, right now the total market cap for the nearly 7 million Bitcoins in existence is $100 million USD. Thus the 21 million BTC would be worth $300 million USD with current market prices.
If the entire world economy was in Bitcoin, it would be much greater than that, yes? So the currency deflates: your money becomes worth more.
Now, one can argue that deflation is worse than inflation. It's basically Keynesian versus Austrian economics. But regardless of which you think is best for society, markets don't really care which is best. Gold continues to become more valuable in spite of the US government forcing its citizens to use a fiat currency.
Bitcoin, if it continues to grow in use as a currency, is likely to follow that trend we see with gold.

I don't understand why everyone is frothing about this. A simple keylogger and your encryption is worthless.
Unfortunately, there is no simple fix that I'm aware of. If someone has control of your PC, nothing can stop your wallet from being compromised.
The best practice is to treat Bitcoin like a bank with multiple accounts. You find a secure machine, whether it's a Linux LiveCD or whatever and create a new wallet. Write down the address. Encrypt the wallet (using Truecrypt or whatever else) and put it on a USB stick. Hell, make two USB sticks.
Throw it in your safe. Keep another elsewhere. Treat it like a huge pile of cash you can keep backups of, but no one can really steal.
Keep a secondary wallet on your PC. Think of it as your checking account. Once you have an uncomfortable amount of funds, or before that point, transfer some of it off to your primary wallet (your savings account).
What will be useful after this is to get a Bitcoin Linux LiveCD specifically for accessing your primary wallet. If you need to access your 25,000BTC stash, you boot from that LiveCD, pop in your USB stick, and do your business.
That's the only way you're ever going to have real security with your Bitcoin funds.

Ah, okay. Fair enough. My main issue is with people arguing that Bitcoin is fiat and that gold is not.

Please see my response to Kaminsky's take on Bitcoin consolidation of power: [
But regardless, we could completely change the block chain and still keep the current transaction history and keys at the time of the transition.  Remember, we have the complete transaction history and ownership details (signatures) for all coins at any given moment in time. Taking that and adapting it to a new network architecture (or even something different from block chaining) won't be unrealistic. And if Bitcoin is years old and a standard at that point, the community will be vested in this migration and ensure it happens.

Did you miss the part where before they shutdown and reset that transaction the price bounced back to about $10? Or how the other exchanges didn't see much of a price drop?
I fail to see how a single exchange having a failure determines the value of Bitcoins. Their value isn't what MtGox says it is. It's what people are willing to pay for them.

Namecoins aren't a competing currency. It's a generalization of the Bitcoin model specifically for the purpose of creating a distributed DNS.
Interestingly enough, the only Namecoin exchange is between NMC and BTC.
Bitcoin, or more specifically, block chains, can be generalized and used to solve other problems. That doesn't hurt Bitcoin though. In fact, if we create separate chains for distributed DNS, timestamping, text storage, etc, the common currency used to buy credits for those chains will likely be Bitcoin.
But that's much different than "Bitcoin2", which is essentially just a new block chain specifically to act as a currency. And that will likely fail. Sure, some people might start a Bitcoin2 chain with some extra features. Some early users will get it and mine a bunch of coins. But if it starts to take off, difficulty will increase. Now you have two difficult chains, where one has value and the other really doesn't.
Of course the people who start that chain will jump right in and hope to get rich by being early. But who is going to switch from Bitcoin when the difficulty rises on Bitcoin2? Now you have a separate chain, far less valued than BTC, and the difficulty is increasing.
PLUS, if people leave Bitcoin to mine Bitcoin2, that means Bitcoin mining will become more profitable again. ;)
It will be a serious challenge to convince everyone to move to a new currency chain.

It's worth noting that it's likely ArtForz peformed the attack for a reason. Most of the 'advantages' SolidCoin touts are surely good ideas at the surface, but there's good reason why Bitcoin doesn't behave that way. Flat fees, for example, have been shown to be vulnerable to attack. The entire way fees are structured now is so that you're paying for the space you're taking up in the blockchain with your tx.
Likewise, Satoshi picked 10 minutes as the difficulty target's goal so that blocks can spread through the network and accidental forks can be avoided, so as to make double spends less likely. SolidCoin uses 3 minute targets, which means that if the hashrate doubles, the network will be likely to get a new block every 1.5 minutes. That means blocks could reasonably be solved in 30 seconds. It should be pretty clear why this is a bad idea.
But essentially, the developer disregarded all of these reasons why Bitcoin wouldn't change, and modified the client to do it anyway and created a new chain. Now when people exploit the holes he was *told existed if these changes were made*, he's shocked and angry.

Kaminsky doesn't seem to be connecting some of the dots. He argues that Visa-scale transaction volume will necessitate a gigabit of bandwidth and huge, beefy machines, and thus will price out the normal person from running their own node. Due to this, only large entities that can afford the processing power and bandwidth will run supernodes. These supernodes could operate as banks and control the transactions going in. He then points out how large the current mining pools are becoming.
Pool-using miners right now *do not process all transactions*. The pool service puts the transactions into a block and sends work to miners which includes the block header. At Visa-scale, this doesn't change. Thus, the major additional overhead will be brought on the pool operators.
But here's the catch. All of us can still control the network. We vote with our hash and back the pooled mining operations that do best by us. Is a major pool a bank that's giving discounts to members and refusing all transactions from outsiders? Well, if that's disrupting our economy, we'll leave for greener pastures. Their hash power drops, and they lose influence.
Even wealthy, single entities, will have a hard time beating distributed computing. And us miners can pool our resources to get $10k 50-core pool servers on gigabit or 10-gigabit pipes.
I think his predictions of bank-like consolidation far less likely than he imagines. We'll have an array of very large pool operators, but their power is dependent on us. As such, we can swiftly punish poor behavior.

Obviously, this is completely identical to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is meant to be like frequent flyer miles or a reward system for shopping with merchants.
@_date: 2011-07-06 22:32:33
Let's assume this is true. Some people made it rich and amassed a large quantity of gold. Some lost money, or barely got by, while merchants popped up and profited.
Is gold today, 160 years later, not a good form of currency? The distribution of gold has never been perfect, but after the pains of getting into circulation, it has been a stellar store of value at a minimum.
Bitcoin is likely to be similar. If we assume its success, then I wouldn't be surprised if it played out similarly. Some will vastly profit, others not as much. But in the end, it still has potential as a viable currency once it further circulates and is used to facilitate trade. The adoption/mining shouldn't diminish that, as it did not diminish gold either.

Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous and offers a degree of plausible deniability.
For example, if I create a temporary address and transfer some coins to it, then another temporary address and transfer it again..you can follow that trail. However, what's to say I didn't just sell 5 coins to some guy I met at a cafe and he sent them to someone else, who used them to buy something?
You can't *prove* I bought that item, as there's an explanation for how else they might have been spent. Likewise, with a US dollar in my wallet, just because my prints are on it and it was eventually used to buy drugs, doesn't mean *I* purchased those drugs. I might have, but any fan of [Where's George]( is aware of how fast money travels.
What's important about Bitcoin is that you can spend without a middleman. Bitcoin will still be better than any kind of middleman (PayPal, banks, etc) that the government is able to regulate.

Right, and your process for deciding involves a group of people, whose importance is defined more or less by their code contribution, getting together and attaining consensus. If the majority of users, miners, and others disagree, they don't have a meaningful way to act on that.
Other than forking, the best they can do is refuse to use the code the core development team commits to the head of the repository. Simple refusal to use changes, however, is not useful when *the disagreement is about a lack of action*. In that situation, the majority of developers can simply block changes.
If you stifle discussion of *forks* by calling them *altcoins*, then you're taking away an important check on the power of the core developers.

I agree to an extent, but I believe a lot of experimental currencies being brought into existence is a great thing: it can bring ideas to the table and have them be taken seriously.

From what I understand, the performance difference isn't even worth discussing. The only additional work is done for each new block, to compute the header. All subsequent 'getwork' requests use that header and have no added computational expense.
So, a pool operator has an unnoticeable amount of extra computing (during the stage where transactions and such are hashed), but miners should see zero performance change.

Couldn't we apply the same arguments to gold as well? Sometimes this is hard to think about because gold is so entrenched into our minds as valuable and worth having.
For example:


















Is gold bad because people were able to easily mine and accumulate a lot of it early on? Unfortunately, the 'mining' idea hasn't really been improved upon. In the case of Bitcoin, it hasn't been well established yet (as gold was during the California gold rush).
Early contributors to Bitcoin were rewarded for securing the network, taking risk, and investing (money in the form of hardware and electricity). There's not a much better way to get a currency into circulation, unfortunately. At least as far as we know.
Anyway, my point is this: if you're going to argue against Bitcoin, do it one of two ways:
1. Argue against the Austrian school of economic thought. If you're against deflationary currency, you should oppose gold and silver.
2. Argue against the technical aspects. There are some legitimate criticisms, although I think they're overblown, personally.

I thought it was silly as well, but part of the reason for keeping the coin concept is to prevent malicious parties from flooding the blockchain with bogus domains. As more people mine, more people can insert domains.
The idea is using 'coins' as the mechanism to allow the information (domain details) allowed into the blockchain to grow along with the growth in CPU resources and peers available. And since domains require renewal, users must keep generating coins (keep running the software) in order to keep the network secure (and prevent an infinite number of insertions or a blockchain growing to unsupportable sizes.
It's actually pretty damn clever.

That's why they advise you to use a new address for each payment you receive. If you have to pay 2BTC and you don't have one transaction worth that much, then you need multiple inputs. There's no way around that.

How is the Bitcoin algorithm not an arbitrary decree or pronouncement?
I noticed that you picked the third definition, and also left out the latter half:


From [Wikipedia](










I've added emphasis here, because this is what you're arguing. So, let's follow the link to the article on [intrinsic value](


Emphasis mine.
I'd also argue that due to the unique features of Bitcoin, that intrinsic value comes from many such features that are not inherent to other currencies. This includes easy international transfer, pseudo-anonymity for online transactions, resistance to outside control (central banking), as well as a much more stable rate of production than metals such as gold and silver.


Bitcoins *are* 'the coin' in this case, except that they're not physical. No paper representation is a strict necessity for a digital currency. They do [exist]( though.
It's comparable to gold. Paper money was a certificate showing that you owned that gold, where the gold is the item which cannot be copied. The paper or certificate could be counterfeited. In this case, bitcoins cannot be counterfeited, duplicated, or created fraudulently (at least according to our current knowledge of mathematics :). They're the actual item of value, not just the representation of that value.

This kind of economic attack would leave unwanted footprints as well. The coin dump would be visible on the exchanges, and the exchanges themselves would know what users were doing it.
It's interesting that both an economic attack as you describe as well as a 51% attack to fork the chain would be detectable and easily attributable to a government entity. Given that, I'd see the community around Bitcoin being strengthened in their resolve to make it succeed if governments find it scary enough to invest that amount of resources in to attack.

This is great. Having you put in a pull request to the Bitcoin devs? This should go into the official client.
@_date: 2011-09-15 00:57:12


I believe the client currently defaults to the oldest coins. The idea is to keep individual transactions as disconnected as possible in an attempt to improve anonymity.
That said, you're going to pay for those inputs regardless of whether they're bundled together or not, so I don't think this would result in you paying fewer fees. It would, however, mean that all of your small purchases would be far more likely to be linked in the block chain, which would be a pattern that could be exploited for statistical analysis of the chain.

How is it inherently valuable? I can't find a source after a quick search, but I recall learning in grade school about certain civilizations that didn't care much about gold and would give it away to European explorers.


'Rare' is subjective. It isn't everywhere, however, and it is fixed. You can't dig up gold in your back yard. Likewise, Bitcoins are becoming rare (you need special mining gear to stand a chance at collecting them now).
Also, gold's uses are pretty minimal. Jewelry? There are lots of 'attractive' things that are not a worthwhile currency or store of value.
It's used now in electronics in some capacity, but gold was a widely accepted currency way before modern computing or electronics came into existence.
Can you suggest anything else gold has a use for?


Yep, Bitcoins and gold both share this problem. In the case of fiat currency such as the USD, the current system involves giving money to financial institutions to lend to consumers and others. USD isn't just being handed out to US citizens equally as it's inflated. So, nothing is a perfect system (thus far). I think Bitcoin is preferable to the way the USD is distributed, but that's just my opinion.


It would be cool to get some more information on that. Feel free to take the initiative and use the blockchain to map out generations of early users. You could probably find the answer to your question without too much effort. We do know that Satoshi probably has about a million coins, but frankly, he deserves it.


Sure. On the other hand, during the California gold rush the early miners grabbed up the easily accessible gold from the top. Later arriving miners had to dig deeper and harder with less return. They're fairly comparable.

Another thing to consider with solo mining is that the difficulty adjusts.
Let's say that right now, the difficulty is such that statistically you should solve a block with your hardware in 60 days. You start solo mining.
Two weeks from now, you haven't solved a block, and the difficulty changes. With the new difficulty, you're statistically likely to solve the block with your hardware in three years.
If you had participated in a decently sized mining pool, you probably could have accumulated ~12.5 coins in that two weeks. Or, you could have gotten lucky and solved the block for 50 coins, but the 12.5 is far more likely.
Basically, you're taking part in a lottery where the odds continuously change based on the number of tickets. Your actual probability isn't fixed at that 60 days projection unless the difficulty doesn't change. That means that if you assume the difficulty will only ever increase, pooled mining should be the most profitable.
Statistics isn't my strong suit though, so please correct me if I'm wrong about the conclusion that pooled mining will be most profitable with increasing hash targets.

Ideally, in the near future: Keep some coins in a MyBitcoin-like service with a mobile app. They keep a QR code near the register. You scan the code to get their wallet, then input the owed amount. You send the payment.


Most businesses will take a check which could bounce, be forged, etc.
If they're willing to accept that risk, it seems like less risk to allow a 0/unconfirmed transaction. Keep in mind that once the merchant sees the transaction, it has likely propagated through most of the network.
The number of attacks at that point are pretty minimal. They could probably ask for ID if they really felt it necessary, as some do with checks.
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:03:38


Sure, but those uses didn't really exist 200 years ago when gold was still very valuable and used as currency.


So gold's intrinsic value is as a medium of exchange? If so, how is that not also an intrinsic value inherent to Bitcoin?
You're equating bitcoins with paper money, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The coins themselves are like gold: according to the rules of the system, they are finite and can't be counterfeited. They require investing resources to mine.
You can use Bitbills and or other services to get a 'paper' form or voucher for them, but the coins are the coins.

At this point, I think there are only two things that could stop Bitcoin: a full on assault from the U.S. government via prosecution of users or blocking of exchanges, or else a serious flaw in the Bitcoin architecture or client. For example, a remote exploit in the Bitcoin client that resulted in private keys for major mining pools or exchanges being compromised.
@_date: 2011-09-14 16:54:21
Another thing to keep in mind is that this is just the requirement for performing a 51% attack to fork the chain from the block at which they start their fork. To actually go back in time and rewrite the chain (back before they start building their fork), they would need seriously greater resources. Even with 12TH/s at their disposal, they could only go back in time 3 blocks/hour while keeping pace with the network's generation rate (and beating it) while building their fork.
The cost to 'change history' with Bitcoin is staggering.
@_date: 2011-07-12 13:39:28


No, I'm actually undecided on the issue.
But I'm fairly certain that if gold has intrinsic value, then so must bitcoins.


Okay, so if you argue that gold's intrinsic value derives from one of our uses for it, in this case jewelry, then lets apply the same to Bitcoin.
Holding a bitcoin allows one the right to securely and (pseudo-)anonymously transfer ownership of that token instantly around the world in a manner which can't be forged and is agreed on and backed by an immense amount of computing power. That ability or use could certainly be pointed to as an intrinsic value for your coin private key. ;)


Does that mean that gold didn't have intrinsic value prior to this historical human consensus of gold's value taking place (i.e., when people were just discovering gold). Does that mean that gold acquired that value? Can bitcoins not similarly acquire that value? If they become an entrenched currency over the next hundred years, do they at some point after that?

Countering the network effect is difficult. It's easier to have a slow transition where users use two different networks and then gradually try to move to the new one.
If folks strictly stopped using one and started using the other, the lack of content/critical mass of users would be problematic, potentially turning those users off entirely and causing the shift to fail as they fall "out of the loop" on new topics or whatever.
Instead, you start discussions on the new board, submit new stories there first, etc, but also join in on the old board. If enough folks start to make a similar shift, you can hopefully attain a critical mass there and kill off the old one.
It's the same reason it's unreasonable to expect folks to use Bitcoin 100% or not at all. It's not practical. You use it where you can, you prefer it over other currencies, and encourage others to do the same. Eventually, one hopes this method can move the majority over to using Bitcoin. But if we tell users "use Bitcoin all the time or not at all", then we fail. Same idea applies here with this sub.

EDIT: Just to clarify, just because the developers don't think anything will happen does not mean that they shouldn't add an extra precautionary check in the event it does.

I counter:


What do you suggest, sending a wallet containing a few coins all members of the US population? There's really not a better means of distribution than rewarding those who contribute the resources necessary to keep the network secure: miners.
And for what it's worth, there are about 6.7 million BTC in circulation of 21 million total possible to mine. Early miners will spend it on goods or convert it to USD, spreading it. The rest will be mined by the increasing pool of miners until it converges on 21 million BTC.




But in that case, miners will always be those that get the currency before it goes into circulation. It's just shifting that role from bankers to those who can afford computing hardware.
With the current system with a fixed number of coins, the miners have a temporary advantage. Eventually, it will disappear and be replaced with transaction fees. Miners don't get the money first, getting that advantage, merely compensation for keeping the network strong from the already created resources in circulation.
@_date: 2011-08-05 16:50:47
To be honest, I'm not sure why the current client announces transactions to all connected peers. Why not broadcast to one, let them broadcast to others, then wait for confirmation via one of your other connected peers announcing it to you?
It's not a perfect solution, but it would probably make it much more difficult to link an IP to a Bitcoin address.
Edit: I wonder if the more long term solution for anonymity is some simple onion routing through the network, with the output being a node that receives and announces the tx.
@_date: 2011-09-14 04:09:19
Honestly, this is probably pretty close.
The other thing he'll probably do is add automatic checkpoints. It seems obvious and like it will work, at face value. Kind of like the other failed features he's added (flat tx fees, for example). What will then happen is malicious clients will send fake blocks down to peers that are starting from SC's genesis block, and they won't be able to tell what the authentic chain is. So new users have no guarantee of security..but hey, if you never disconnect from the network, you're golden.
Assuming he sees the flaws in that, I suppose he try setting up a central location for pulling checkpoints which he controls. He'll update the checkpoint daily himself at some URL, instead of compiling it into the client. 50BTC to the first guy to seize control of his web server and/or domain and forge false checkpoints, completely choking the network or forcing the network to accept their forked chain. Hopefully he'll at least include his public key and provide signed updates..but it's still a completely terrible idea which is essentially centralizing control of the network.
He who holds the public key controls the chain.
Simply put, there's really no solution to the &gt;51% hashing problem which still involves using proof-of-work while remaining completely decentralized. Hard coded checkpoints are a temporary hack to try to prevent potential damage from an undiscovered exploit while Bitcoin is growing. If he actually has a solution beyond that, it would probably invalidate the very idea of block chains.

You can't just say "the economy is too complex and you wouldn't understand it" and use that as a justification for why you think Bitcoin will fail.
If you could explain why, that would be much appreciated. Also, it's worth noting that if you're coming from the perspective of fiat currency being the only viable system, then that makes sense (from that perspective).
However, Bitcoin seems to have strong parallels to gold and the Austrian school of monetary thought. If you agree with the Austrian model, then Bitcoin looks pretty promising.

Actually, he could implement merged mining on his chain and piggyback on the computational resources of the Bitcoin chain, if he could convince Bitcoin miners to mine both chains.

@_date: 2011-07-07 12:57:25


No, that is false. Unlike gold, Bitcoin has a regularly adjusting difficulty target. If mining becomes unprofitable, people stop mining, difficulty decreases. Otherwise, the value of a Bitcoin increases or people will start asking for transaction fees.
It's unlikely that people will continue to do something without a return, but it certainly won't be as huge of a return as previously.


It's one guy with that much. It's worth noting that in the case of Satoshi, the guy is paranoid about his privacy. He only ever communicated through Tor and it's pretty easy to identify his coins. If he were to cash out, we would all know and he could lose his anonymity.
I imagine Satoshi will sit on his small Bitcoin fortune for quite some time.


There will be far more than 10 million BTC in circulation before it's maximally successful. :)
But again, what was Satoshi supposed to do? Go out and yell about Bitcoin and have 10,000 users lined up before starting the network? People starting running Bitcoin because it was out there and already running. Satoshi only made money because the difficulty target was so low with just him at first. He didn't have a better solution.


But again, this system perpetuates. But more importantly: The bankers benefit by forcing us to use our money. Saving money under a mattress is to watch it lose its value. This is done through inflation, and will last forever (or until modern currencies fail).
You don't see how this is different from one guy having a one time mass of coins? If Satoshi were to dump all of his coins, their value would decrease because the money in circulation would increase. So he's better holding it, letting the market not even consider it to exist...much like someone sitting on a stockpile of gold. It doesn't affect everyone else with gold all that much.

A block size increase is the only short to mid term scaling solution that I've seen proposed. Segregated Witness is really interesting, but isn't going to be sufficient to get us through to Lightning and longer term scaling solutions.
It's taken us, what, two years to get to the point where Segregated Witness is in a Core release? I can't see us deploying anything more quickly than that, and if we're in the 2020s with no more than effectively 2MB of capacity, then Bitcoin growth is miserably low and we have significant problems.
@_date: 2011-09-14 21:10:26
Bitcoin transactions can have multiple inputs and outputs. Here's an example.
You have a clean wallet with no balance. You ask 100 users to send you 0.01 BTC each. Your new balance is 1 BTC. Now when you go to make a payment to someone for 1 BTC, you have 100 inputs. That is, you need to sign 100 allocations of 0.01 BTC over to a new owner. This is a rather large transaction with 100 inputs and 1 output.
That transaction takes up more space in the block chain in bytes.
Blocks themselves are made up of these transactions. However, there is a size limit for a block (currently 500kB). As the transaction pool increases, tx fees increase.
The rules are something like:














So, since the blocks are a fixed size, if they were to be filled by one or a few people..that means that no one would be able to initiate transactions, effectively choking the network. Thus, Bitcoin makes it costly for people to perform this sort of denial of service attack. They'll quickly run out of money, or at least have to spend a lot to keep up the attack. But then miners will want the exorbitant fees, and thus hash power could come in to temporarily speed things up, etc.
The attack on SolidCoin should be more clear now. ArtForz created transactions with lots of small outputs, then that mass of small outputs into lots of small inputs..then back into hundreds of small outputs..repeatedly. He was able to fill blocks to capacity for a small, flat fee.
So now the question is: why have a fixed block size? Well, imagine SolidCoin lifted the restriction on block size, but kept the flat fees. Now ArtForz can slam the chain with an unlimited amount of data. He could probably bloat the chain up to the current size of Bitcoin's chain and beyond very rapidly.
Think of transaction fees this way: you're paying for the space you're taking up in the chain.

Not that it diminishes your argument, but just to correct this: Satoshi probably has around 1/21 of all Bitcoins that will ever exist, as the upper limit is 21 million BTC.


I'm not sure. Someone would need to analyze the blockchain, but I doubt they're nearly as large. Remember, Satoshi was probably the only user for quite some time. But certainly, users 2, 3, 4, 5, etc probably have on the order of 10,000s of Bitcoins, I'd guess.


We're talking about a few early adopters. The Federal Reserve perpetuates this system, whereas Bitcoin is designed to phase this out over time. Beyond that, it's inaccurate to call them a 'knowledgeable few'. We're talking about the inventor and a bunch of investors, essentially.
And seriously, if Bitcoin takes off and becomes a popular currency..you don't believe Satoshi, the individual(s) who created Bitcoin, deserves to be made rich from it?

This merged mining approach allows you to mine on both chains simultaneously.
Assuming Bitcoin is higher in difficulty, if you solve a Bitcoin block, you would also solve a Namecoin block. A hash just a little below the Bitcoin hash target may still solve a Namecoin block, however.
The potential here is huge. Since there wouldn't be any reason *not* to mine both simultaneously, we should see everyone adopt both chains and apply Bitcoin's computing resources to protecting other chains, distributed DNS in this case.
So, if anyone builds other cool ideas on top of Nakamoto block chains, we can keep them separate from the main Bitcoin chain and yet still let them be powered by anyone willing to subscribe to them, essentially, with no cost to their Bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2011-07-16 05:14:33
You can only try this out on testnet. This code won't work with the production block chains until &gt;50% of Namecoin miners upgrade to a patched namecoind which supports it. The community also needs to agree on a block in the future to designate as the point at which the patched clients will apply the change to all subsequent blocks.
So the code exists for merged mining, but you can't do it yet. It'll probably be a minimum of a month or two before we'll be able to use this.

I think part of the shock is due to people thinking of Bitcoin as relatively young, which it is, but they don't realize that the current chain has two years of history in it.

I do think Tor is a bit of an overly complex way to solve the problem for the average person, and expecting all Bitcoin uses to install Tor alongside their wallet of choice is not ideal.
Do you think it's feasible to implement very simple onion routing for transaction announcements? It seems the fundamental problem is that we announce transactions directly to our adjacent peers. What if we used simple onion routing to ensure that transactions propagate a few hops through the network before they're more broadly announced?
The only downside would be an increase in bandwidth, but it should still be fairly minimal compared to the bandwidth cost of fully propagating all transactions anyway.

Bitcoins aren't given away like printing a coupon. They're awarded in a lottery system where a ticket is rewarded for completing computationally difficult work. That work is deemed useful by participants because it strengthens the network from outside attack and influence. I'd like to hear you describe a better coin distribution model.


Arguably, the value inherent in Bitcoin comes from it's features. Low transaction fees, lack of central control, pseudo-anonymity, fixed quantity, protection from counterfeiting, etc.


Apparently, any tool used to protect freedom of some sort is "black market". You should throw Tor, Freenet, GPG, et al in there as well, I suppose.


Recognition by a foreign nation has never been a goal of the Bitcoin project, as far as I'm aware. It was aimed at fixing several problems identified with national currencies.
However, it's worth noting that there are plenty of alternative currencies in use today with no [government backing]( Bitcoin differs from them in that it trivializes making an alternative currency truly global. That's something no one has been able to manage before.
Also, you're really gung ho about this black market nonsense. Apparently, you're peeved that people can use bitcoins to buy pot?

I'm not arguing against a fee market: I'm suggesting that fees are too high because we're not allowing for any growth. When fees are high enough that people are hesitant to send a transaction, or prefer to use another means to pay, then that is indeed a problem.
How will you ever establish a healthy fee market if your users leave, or best case scenario, just sit on Bitcoin *purely* as a speculative asset?

Okay, so what is the intrinsic value of gold? It looks pretty?
I've seen two uses mentioned: jewelry and for industrial use. Gold was valued before it had industrial uses, and lots of things make pretty jewelry (including near worthless things like shells, feathers, etc).
So I don't see a real intrinsic value by that definition.
However, if you consider gold's intrinsic value to be the cost of extracting it from the Earth, then Bitcoin also has intrinsic value due to the costs associated with generating new coins (electricity, hardware).

I believe the problem is that we as a collective group (as evidenced by theymos being at -330 karma) don't agree. The fundamental problem here is that it's *one guy* showing them the door, when the community overwhelming opposes that action.

Isn't that the same criticism Bitcoin receives because of the fixed supply, which ensures deflation?
@_date: 2011-07-07 16:09:44


Fiat literally means:


Can you give me an example of a currency backed by something of intrinsic value? How about gold? What is the intrinsic value of gold, and how does it differ from Bitcoin?
As I see it, gold has properties such as its scarcity and the effort expended to mine the limited supply of it. Bitcoin shares those properties. It's a finite resource that requires resources to be expended to mine that supply (hardware, electricity) via proof of work.


Declaration is defined as:


Who announces it? Do the Bitcoin developers pick a price?
By that logic, are stock prices declared? Of course not. The value of bitcoins are determined based purely on what an individual is willing to buy or sell for. It's controlled by supply and demand, with users finding value in the effort expended to mine them, scarcity, as well as features uncommon to other currencies (easy international commerce, pseudo-anonymity).

Well, since I hold a fair amount of BTC anyway, this isn't necessarily my use case, but it's cool that the option is there. I'm sure some people might want a balance which involves letting them hold some USD for you.
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:21:08
Maybe I'm out of the loop these days, but I thought I read someone proposing zero knowledge proofs as a possible solution to chain bloat. 
The idea would be that you have a proof that ensures that concensus rules were applied to create the current UTXO set for the current block, without actually knowing *what transactions created it*. Thus, while some large archives might store the full transaction history for posterity, no users/miners would need to concern themselves with it.
It seems like there are a lot of possible paths to scalability, heh.
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:35:33
Their hardware is for general purpose computing. Think of the orders of magnitude more hash power you get with an ASIC compared to the best CPU available. Now, look at the total money spent in your examples. Do you think $1B of ASICs will be outperformed by even $100B of general purpose server hardware?
The answer is certainly no.
Now, that said, those entities could certainly buy that much hardware, but to what end? Is it worth billions to control the network and destroy trust in it? That's the question.

They're more than capable of converting ETH-&gt;ETC, if they prefer to remain on that chain. Coinbase is allowing them to withdraw the more valuable coin.
In this scenario, they actually had plenty of notice that a hard fork was happening and that it had significant consensus. They could have, and should have, withdrawn their funds in advance if they wished to stay on the obvious minority chain.
The onus is not on Coinbase to provide infrastructure which accommodates the losers in a hard fork.

Agreed. I actually really appreciate that it's in USD until redeemed as well, so you can stock more than you might want to hold and avoid volatility, then just convert a fixed amount of spending money as needed.

Sounds like someone doesn't value Bitcoin surviving as a useful means of exchange.
Like it or not, we need services like Coinbase to bootstrap Bitcoin. Once we live in a world where everyone is holding BTC, services like Coinbase will be significantly less necessary.
Until then, I'm willing to support them and help push Bitcoin into the mainstream.
@_date: 2015-02-24 06:20:17


This is the thing I suspect most don't consider. The community (excluding miners) and developers could, attaining community consensus, switch away (or threaten to switch away) from sha256, leaving miners with piles of worthless hardware.
It's the ultimate trump card, and the worst thing it would do is move mining back over to a "anyone can do it with a CPU/GPU" game, which would help attain immediate decentralization that mining conglomerates are powerless to fight.
@_date: 2016-07-27 04:05:36
Does this include all hard forks, including the one that instituted the 1MB block size limit? Would it have been reasonable to demand that Coinbase allow us to withdraw onto the pre-limit chain, since THAT is actually the real Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-27 04:22:15
Well, my brain is clearly not working tonight. You are indeed correct.

Except for this bit about the [IETF](


Which leads to the [Internet Society](














So, while Cody Wilson is *technically correct*, that is, unfortunately, *not* the best kind of correct. The Bitcoin Foundation actually is more akin to the Internet Society, which acts as the parent organization of the IETF.
Something tells me, however, that Cody would be displeased if the end result of his shenanigans was a Bitcoin Foundation which acted as the parent organization for a Bitcoin Engineering Task Force.

Uh, yes? It was a change to the consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:40:36
There's clearly more nuance to it than that. If I create my own fork of Bitcoin called BitcoinFuckYall, is Coinbase stealing from me by not sending coins to my forked chain?

Alternatively: developers either get *paid* to work on a really cool project or spend some of their spare time working on a fun hobby that most likely provides (or has provided them) a nice return because of their early investment.
ViaBTC and other pools/miners provides millions of dollars of hardware and/or infrastructure that's necessary to secure the network, and are rewarded for doing so financially.
Both provide investment in terms of time or money in exchange for a return in the form of money, professional opportunity, personal development, or fun.
Both are extremely important to our ecosystem and are necessary for it to thrive.
It's also worth noting that folks on the opposite side of the fence from you who agree with ViaBTC include developers who also helped create this really cool project. The current Core developers do not have an exclusive claim here.
I'm not making a claim to one side of the debate being right or wrong--merely suggesting that your comment is disingenuous to the contributions made by all parties.


They have a non-trivial financial investment in our ecosystem. They're allowed to advocate for an outcome that they feel protects it, even if you believe they're wrong. They may be ignorant, perhaps, depending on your perspective, but not self-righteous.

Certificates in no way invalidate the proof-of-work system and the block chain, since certificates in no way solve the double spend problem. To argue otherwise is nonsense.
The reality is that, this makes Bitcoin easier for merchant transactions and doesn't really add that much more risk. You're already vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks from malicious SSL certificates when shopping with a merchant that accepts bitcoin as payment. Instead of sending a bogus payment request to your client (via BIP70), they'll just swap in their own Bitcoin address during checkout on the merchant's website, coaxing you to send payment to them instead. Either way, if they can get around the CA system, you're boned for standard merchant transactions.
The only 100% safe way to transfer payments to the intended recipient is to make contact with that recipient in a way that guarantees impersonation can't take place and to verify the address (ie, call Bob and ask him to read off a portion of the address to you, have Alice send you a GPG signed email, etc). This isn't feasible for most transactions, since it would be inconvenient. Thankfully, most merchant transactions online are rather small.
For sending large transactions, however, you can still rely on that method of authentication and use addresses directly. You won't be forced to use the BIP70 payment method. It's there as a convenience.

One thing to consider here is that with your current customers, they're likely to hold one or two cards. Let's say I come to your business with a Visa card. If you want to accept it, you need to work with Visa.
With someone like Coinbase, that isn't the case. Your customer comes in with a Bitcoin wallet, and you accept their payment with Coinbase. If you decide that your relationship with Coinbase isn't working out, then you can switch to one of their competitors, like Bitpay. Your customers don't notice the difference and continue to use their existing wallets.
Unlike Visa, Amex, et al, Coinbase can't hold a pre-existing base of users over your head in order to coerce you into dealing with them. Instead, they need to compete on their merits alone. Any third party merchant service could come in and replace them with a better service, better deal, etc. Coinbase doesn't gate access to any single Bitcoin holder. :)
It helps to think of Bitcoin as digital cash. You can choose any bank you want to hold the US dollars that your customers give you, or hold them yourself. Same with Bitcoin.

Has anyone tried to figure out what the increase in block chain growth would be if everyone immediately switched over to HD wallets and started applying this as best practice?
Bitcoin transactions lead to coins being divided up into smaller and smaller fragments, but they can (and usually do) end up later being merged back into larger chunks. However, it seems the end game for HD wallets is perpetual fragmentation.
I suppose you could give the user a decision: pick a more secure/anonymized transaction which will cost more in fees to send, or merge multiple inputs into one transaction and lose the enhanced privacy in exchange for a cheaper transaction. But for the average 'Joe', doesn't this just introduce more confusion?
