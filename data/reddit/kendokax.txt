The block chain has intrinsic value.  Its hard to come up with a decent parallel because most things with intrinsic value are tangible.  The best example I can think of is a pdf of a franchise's operating document.  The value isn't the electricity, but the information on how to run the business.  Likewise the numbers on the ledger are intrinsically worthless, but the whole system that tracks how those worthless numbers move is very valuable once it was proven to work.  That systemic value gives value to the worthless bits.

If you want to push that point then yes it has no intrinsic value, but nothing has intrinsic value because all value is subjective.  If meteors rained down a substance that was "better" than gold in every use gold has and in high enough quantity that it could satisfy every commercial and industrial use for gold, gold would become worthless overnight, and any wealth you had in gold would be lost  (Yes, i moved the goal post. )

According to this article it does.
tldr: its intrinsic value is as a transfer system like how wire transfers have an intrinsic value.

I don't understand the point you are trying to make. Is it:
A) that the main structural challenge bitcoin faces in that there are established fiat currencies that have wide acceptance and infrastructure to support them? If so what makes bitcoin different from any other emerging technology that is trying to replace an established standard?
B) the main problem that bitcoin is trying to fix is the financial and economic structures put in place to use fiat  money as a tool to empower the political elites?  if so why should we care about this solution rather than all the others that have tried to stop or mitigate these structures that have thus far had little effect?
