How much did you pay for all that hardware, and how much is your electricity bill?

Okay, good explanation - thanks

It will take some time for the financial services industry to accept it as a standard currency like any other, but conferences like this, the WSJ writing about it in their blogs as "something to look out for" and the overall trend with bitcoin makes it promising.

This is untrue in the case of untrustworthy vendors. Once I had to file a chargeback with my credit card company because of an error on Newegg's behalf that they refused to acknowledge. That option would not have been available with bitcoins, and I would be out $200.

Is that per day? per month? year?

500k net income per month.. not bad for a 1.2m investment

Well it may not be a threat yet, but if bitcoins grow to $10k or $50k as some predict, they will be a suitable alternative to the world's reserve currency and commodities like gold. This will indeed bother the governments that hold so much gold or so much US debt. It's in the USs own interests that it's currency isn't devalued.
So I guess what I'm missing is the second part of your point - if the world's largest and most powerful government sees bitcoins as a threat to it's own monetary stability, why wouldn't it invest in enough mining hardware (or even just turn its supercomputers to mine) to break the 50% barrier and destabilize the currency forever? And who could or would stop them?

So you're telling me that for less than $100 million, this whole crypto currency market can be shattered?
Am I missing something? Does the government perhaps not see it as a threat for this particular reason?
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:04:13
Yeah, and what about the people he ordered hits on? Keeping them safe too?
@_date: 2014-06-16 03:45:03
What is stopping a government agency or treasury from creating their own powerful pool with &gt;50% hashpower, and taking control of the currency? Wouldn't that be a major goal/aim of a government whose currency is threatened by bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies?

A startup I know of just submitted the NY license and did it all over one weekend because that's all they were told that they have. It's possible, stop making excuses.
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:29:36
Are you just holding them in btc, or are they invested somewhere?

Is Butterfly Labs really going to deliver?
I feel like a moron ordering their 5GH/s device for $308 shipped and _then_ doing my research about their shipping times. Seemed like a steal in the moment.. now I feel like I'm not the one getting the steal.

Yeah and when you consider its monstrous power draw, you're probably going to be losing money on a continuous basis.
