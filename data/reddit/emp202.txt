That flight you booked for your holiday last time more than likely emited more CO2 in a bunch than can emit in a year if he'd be driving around in that thing 24/7. 
Also, lets not get into how driving a used car stacks up to buying a newly produced one just for "environmental efficicency".

To make BTC mining as quantum resistant as it is "asic resistant" today, you basically just need to move from SHA-256 to SHA-512. This however results in larger block entries. At the moment scalability seems more like a priority i guess.  
Tx signatures are a different beast, but Lamport signatures are a thing and could be implemented. Albeit, also at the cost of blockspace.

IF your weekly buy is 1 bitcoin. I recon at current levels, it's a lot lower for most people. When your weekly buy is 50 bucks, you're definitely in "is it worth my time to constantly watch the market?" territory. 
Yes, it's fun, but there's also a world out there. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:25:40
As for your first paragraph, can you elaborate on who said that if the price is low bitcoin sucks, and when?
I think we all can agree that the price will not go straight up forever. It will "crash" sometime, and a certain amount of current "get rich quick" investors will lose trust because they see their investment cut by a two digit percentage and panicsell. I don't think that's FUD in any way. It's pretty much a given. The question of how this affects bitcoin - remains to be seen. However, noone declared any possible outcome and even less the doom of bitcoin so far, from what i read. 
As for your second paragraph, can you elaborate on how any of these would cause a bull market?

If your definition of a good life is living in ever changing places out of a suitcase to have more free money to make more money ... 
Then i guess that works. 
Some people want a little more from life than making money and then eventually dying, though. Can't fault them. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:55:19


And that's precisely the point. It doesn't mean shit, and you have to stop taking it so personal when someone calls it a bubble. Is housing in a bubble right now? I think yes. Does that mean that housing is useless and noone should buy housing right now? I guess not. 


No, not really. The thing that drives the prices of equities right now is essentially the free money created by the FEDs policies, which is essentially a case for bitcoin, as this make traditional finance a potemkin village just waiting to collapse once the first storm hits. 
The things you mentioned however are not driving equity prices up, which is easy to see in a lot of cases. The LIBOR manipulation didn't affect stocks in any way. Naked short selling actually creates downward pressure that results in a bear market (not a bull). This is what's keeping silver down right now, for example, but it's effect in the stock market right now has to be negligible or we wouldn't see a constant rise. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:37:44
If that works for you, great. 
I don't think it would work for most people. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:24:52
I'm a firm believer in Bitcoin, but when the words "useless FUD" get sprayed over everyone raising legitimate concerns in reasonable wording, that's about the surest sign of a mania i can think of. 
People have "lost trust in the stock market" pretty often in history. The TINA scenario of today is a pretty new thing, and it's not so much trust in the stockmarket but the lack of alternatives that drives the current secular bull-market in equities.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:02:41
You're saying like stocks in 87, 2001 or 2008, right? Right? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:35:19
Indeed it does, and since neither you nor i can predict the future, your logic only makes sense with a severe hindsight bias. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:26:37
Name one criterion whereby any investor could be reasonably certain ( &gt;51% chance) at the time of the peak or slightly before or slightly after, that BTC would drop to it's current levels instead of continuing to rise. Do yourself a favor and test it for hindsight bias before you write it down here. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:48:21
Only if you're suffering from a severe case of [hindsight bias](

You either don't want to get it intentionally or have no motivation to actually read up on what you are talking about. We are done here. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:22:14
If you had really "worked in behavioural economics" or even heard the lectures on it, there would be no need to explain. I call bullshit.
The point is, in short, that the future can not be predicted and you are judging behaviour in hindsight (hence hindsight bias). And i don't think you are stupid enough to not get that, you are just trolling now.

They seized the laptop because it might contain evidence for internet-based drug trading. Which is perfectly normal, not just in germany but i guess it would be in the US as well.

@_date: 2017-05-02 08:40:52
That makes just about zero sense. Something is either income or capital gains. What it is does not change according to the time you hold something. The ruling, to my knowledge, is actually that Bitcoins are things, so it's a "privates Veräußerungsgeschäft", which is indeed taxfree after a year of "Spekulationsfrist".

Not sure what you're talking about or how you are trying to spin what said. Merkel effectively lifted Schengen for a certain duration resulting in uncontrolled/unlimited migration. This in no way factually wrong or misinformed.

Yes, i would and probably would However, what i see is a lot of them flat out refusing to integrate into the very society they migrated to. And it's obviously my fault, because i'm ethically predispositioned to be a racist. Or so the story goes.

No, i don't. Dublin is about polictial asylum. We are talking crossing borders here, and so we are talking about Schengen. Also "Aussetzung des Schengener Abkommens" was the official name given to the situation by the german government.

We're talking a sub 100kEUR here according to OP. Never ever is german police going to bring 7 people on a raid for a sum like that. There's no way in hell there'd even be a search warrant. You'd get a more-or-less-nice letter in the mail from a Staatsanwalt, asking you to explain, but that's about it. For the police to raid you for a capital crime, you'd have to be in 7 figures and even then it's dubious. So.. yea. Drugs.
