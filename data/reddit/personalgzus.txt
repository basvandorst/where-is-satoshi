It's not just difficulty, it's also an issue of trust and cost. It's not difficult to buy a big screen TV, that doesn't mean everyone does it.
You can't make wild assumptions and use the word "certainly" in the same sentence.
1) 8 million people was a number pulled out of thin air for the sake of example and is in no way verifiable.  
2) Just because 8 million people own coin does not mean that 8 million people are actively attempting to acquire more.  
3) Just because 8 million people own does not mean they are willing to risk between $300-$600 on this technology. That is a lot of money for some (most?) people. Many people would be more comfortable buying it at less than a whole coin.  
4) The majority of bitcoiners I know own less than a coin at any given time, unless they are hodlers.

I would actually argue that you may be trapped in the opposite bubble. r/bitcoin is generally subscribed to by established bitcoin users, and lately it has been a place for long term holders to share their despair. It is probably not, in any way, a good indicator of the sentiment of **new** users. Especially if we are expecting the next wave of new users to arise from 3rd world countries or the investment banking industry - neither of these groups would be well represented here.


These statements can only be made by people that were already invested in coin at a higher price and/or made poor trades. New users can't swear off something they haven't started using yet, so you can't use this as evidence of bitcoin not spreading.


This is a fairly misleading stat. How many of those 1 Billion unique visitors never even create a username, or subscribe to any subreddits at all? The most popular subreddit in existence (r/funny) only has a 0.68% subscriber rate when compared to the 1 billion users you are referring to. I would argue that a better indicator would be the percentage of total active reddit users with subscriptions, but even that is not a directly correlated metric, because I - a single user - can make as many reddit accounts as I want and subscribe each of them to a variety of subreddits. r/bitcoin's subscriber base is currently ranked  among all subreddits.
Saying that 0.015% of reddit users are r/bitcoin subscribers is probably extremely inaccurate, but even if your estimate is dead-on it's not really saying much. Every indicator (unique wallet addresses, mining difficulty, bitcoin days destroyed) suggests that the total number of bitcoin users is still on the rise.

You're statements make so little sense that I seriously think you might be in the wrong thread.
This was a conversation about Circle vs. Coinbase and you randomly join in spouting off some random shit about credit card fees and western union?
You keep linking to other reddit posts like they have anything to do with what people are talking about in this conversation?
No one promised you that Circle would save you from credit card fees if you're using a credit card to buy coin - that doesn't make any fucking sense. If you're using a CC to by ANYTHING you are going to pay those fees.
NOBODY HERE BROUGHT UP WESTERN UNION BUT YOU.
I'm sorry that you are without a bank account and dependent on CC and Western Union but that is absolutely not Circle's or Bitcoin's fault. No one on this thread is trying to convince you to stop using CCs and WU and use Circle instead - I don't give a flying fuck if you use Circle or not. Please stop spouting nonsense, you're completely out of your element.

These bearish quotes are taken out of context from an interview at SXSW back in March.
His more recent quotes sound a lot more open minded:






@_date: 2014-09-30 03:12:38
Agree. The mining arms race has put us out of equilibrium and we are achieving the block reward too often (i.e., average block time is less than 10 minutes).
The next difficulty increase will put a lot of miners out of business. As this happens we will lose hash power and experience a period where the average block time is actually *longer* than 10 minutes.
Longer block time = increased scarcity = increased price.  
But first some of the mining competition needs to die out.

If you constantly dampen market excitement in the presence of good news a rebound will never occur. People need to let these sort of events speak for themselves and stop telling everyone "This is a huge deal" or "This is nothing, don't get excited".
The market needs to determine its own reaction - but for the most part I think excitement over good news is a good thing, within reason.

I think people are just hoping that it makes obtaining coin a much quicker, easier, safer and more straightforward process - hopefully knocking down some of those adoption barriers that stand between new users and their first coin purchase.
Edit: Realized I didn't really directly answer your question. Circle's innovation lies in the fact that they will offer 100% insurance against theft and fraud and that they will honor purchases much, much quicker than services like Coinbase. They will also be selling coin "at cost" so there will be no fee for purchasing as there is on other services - although I'm sure they will recoup these funds somehow. The goal is to make the interface very user friendly, for brand-new-bitcoiners and early-adopters, alike. The analogy I have heard is that people are hoping Circle will be to Bitcoin what AOL was to web-browsing.

This is an utterly meaningless statement devoid of any substance. I could just as easily say


Neither statement is supported by fact, or even founded in logic. And further more, your original argument stated that this auction would have either no effect on price, or a negative effect on price and would not correlate to a market price. These statements have been fundamentally [proven to be incorrect]( You proposed a completely illogical argument and then defended your position by saying "I guess we'll see." Now you've come back to say "The bid wasn't announced - I assume I'm possibly right." These are worthless contributions to a Socratic discussion.

Nothing about Bitcoin necessitates this shift. There's no reason that the same consumer based capitalism couldn't continue in a Bitcoin-based economy.


Again, there is no reason to assume that a shift to Bitcoin would cause this reaction. People could just as easily invest in stocks using Bitcoin, just as people are able to invest in other stock markets using a plethora of international currencies. Switching from fiat will not damage the overall value offered by a stock trading system - stock markets are a huge contributor to a healthy and stable investment economy. The rise of Bitcoin does not require the destruction of current investment avenues.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:18:00
I give you points for derision and condescension, but your statement is just meaningless snark. There is no 'fundamental purpose' of market manipulation, other than just that - to manipulate pricing and sentiment.
Manipulation takes place in all markets at all times for millions of different 'fundamental purposes'. Some manipulators want to steadily increase price, some want an artificial crash, some want a bubble cycle, some want to 'cap' the market and maintain stability.
All I'm saying is that if the heavy manipulators in the BTC market want the same thing I want (a higher price) then I am content to have them maneuvering in the market. You act as if all manipulation is inherently bad for the market - **that** is a narrow view.

Let's take an analagous approach and see where it gets us.

There has literally only been one halving event since the inception of Bitcoin, and it was almost 2 years ago. That's a pretty small sample size. But that's beside the point - I'm not saying that a halving will double the price, I'm saying that cutting the number of coins in the block reward by half will not necessarily cut the *value* of the block reward by half. Maybe green energy developments will make electricity half as expensive. Maybe tech advances will make equivalently priced mining equipment twice as powerful. Lots of things affect the value of the block reward - not just the number of coins being delivered.
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:42:57


Coinbase does not take a cut when you send coin, only when you purchase it from them. And you don't *need* to use either of these services to transfer coin to another wallet.

My reasoning goes like this:
The immediate effect of this auction was to shake market confidence and devalue the commodity
Damaged market confidence leads to downward pressure
Unlike last time, this auction was won by a syndicate of average joes, not a single rich investor
Average joes are far more susceptible to downward pressure than rich investors
This means that, again, unlike last time, if price continues to fall, many of these investors will be forced to sell, which will perpetuate the downward pressure on the rest of the market
Make no mistake - every reaction to this auction so far has been a strong bearish signal. People should not be pretending like this is insignificant, we could be in for another serious drop.

Jesus dude - did coinbase kill your parents or something? You are reaching Bruce Wayne levels of butt-hurt.
Both Coinbase and Circle are really valuable tools for buying coin. They make the process quick, easy and approachable - especially for the uninitiated. The fact that they are large companies means that they can advertise and accept risks in ways that small companies cannot. This is **good** for the long term spread of Bitcoin utility. While I agree that storing coin for long periods in either system is a mistake, I see no problem in using these companies as merchants and moving your purchased coin to your own private wallet.
Why do you hate big business so much? Call me crazy, but I believe in capitalism. A founding principal of capitalism is that successful business models are rewarded with growth. When you say "Do not work with big businesses" (or type it in all caps, like a douche) what you're really saying is "Don't work with companies who have developed a proven track record of competence and trust; instead constantly take new chances on start-up companies, or personally accept all the risk and attempt to do it all yourself!"
If everyone took this approach the only BTC holders would be miners and no one would be able to use it for anything. Large companies provide easy, trustworthy on-ramps to new technology and the Bitcoin space desperately needs more, not less.

In addition to money laundering and licensing violations I'm sure he was also intending to commit high level tax evasion on his capital gains.

If the merchant doesn't want to charge you sales tax - as in wants to break federal merchant transaction laws - then it is incredibly unlikely that they would be able to successfully employ a debit payment system (where all payments are reported through a banking service).

This isn't correct. Or, at the very least, it is an extreme over-simplification.
The premise of socialism is not that the workers own the means of production - actually, it's kind of the opposite. The means of production are owned and controlled by *the society as a whole*.
Since government is the embodiment of societal control regulations, and since currency is the mechanism of modern production, I would argue that my statement is completely accurate. In a socialist system the government *needs* to control the creation and distribution of currency. Bitcoin would not function in this system because it can **only** be distributed by those who own it. Neither the government nor "the workers" can gain access to my means of production unless I specifically allow it - which completely nullifies any shared ownership or "democratic" control.

Just because markets behave rationally does not mean participating bodies always make the RIGHT decision - just that they make their decisions for logical reasons. Besides, there are lots of situations in which you could sell/trade commodities under book value and still make a profit. Like all economic situations, it is simply a question of supply vs. demand and risk vs. reward. Perhaps selling under book value allows for an increased volume of sales - like Target putting inventory on sale. Even though items are sold below what the market could bear, Target has made a RATIONAL decision that the quantity of sales will balance out the decreased profit margin. They may or may not end up being correct, based on the number of sales actually recorded, but the over all behavior (as with the behavior of the market as a whole) is RATIONAL.
Even in situations of moral hazard (i.e., Enron) the decisions being made are logical - the reasons are just corrupt and selfish, with the personal interests of executives placed above that of the stock holders.
Do you really think that stock markets are a completely random and illogical roulette game in to which people invest hundreds of millions of dollars? How, then, would you explain consistent economic successes like Warren Buffet? Is he a psychic?
Every trend and force in the open market can be explained through rational correlations of cause and effect. This does not mean that predictions are always accurate or that there is no risk involved, but to say "Oh well, markets are random - that's how profit works!" is completely inaccurate, bordering on ridiculous. If this were the case, investment interest rates and/or stable currency would be non-existent.

I think you jumped in to this conversation out of context. The premise of this discussion is that ParisGypsie claims he predicted this price drop "from Day 1" (and is presumably predicting more to come). I am making the point that if he really believed he knew this with confidence, he would have put his money where his mouth was - since his opportunity to profit was astronomical.

What I mean is that the risk of an utter collapse of the [commodity value/economy] was much higher and the early adopters were 100% responsible for supporting the [community/economy] through it's incredibly high risk development and distribution phase. Where as today, when buying a single bitcoin, you have far more assurances that this coin will retain it's value for a [day/week/month] and that you'll be able to sell it [tomorrow/next week] if you wanted. Many of the early adopters didn't even have a place to liquidate their coin if a collapse did occur. Today, if price drops to a point I am uncomfortable with, there are a dozen different places that I could liquidate my holdings. And mining was never zero risk, it's just that it required investments in the form of time and effort rather than buying a fancy rig. I assume the concept of opportunity costs is a little above your head, so I won't bother.
But I also mean that you're a lazy troll who I see posting on here frequently and you've given me no reason to believe that you're interested in a constructive conversation of any sort.

TL;DR Porn sites make up crazy large revenue values to make the industry appear more successful and no one really calls them on it. Some estimates run as high as $10 Billion - $14 Billion.

You're grasping at straws, dude.


First of all, markets can *literally* only exist through cooperation. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of mutually beneficial trade then you are way out of your depth - it is the cornerstone of capitalism.


This is nonsense, unless you are assuming that I am a day trader. A day trader does not care about the long term trend of a commodity and focuses solely on the profit they can make from short term volatility. Since I have already told you that my concern is in the long term increase of bitcoin price (i.e., I am a long-term holder) then you should know that the manipulator is in no way in direct buy/sell competition with me. And even if I was a day trader, as long as his manipulations fell in line with my trades, it could still be a mutually beneficial arrangement.


Again, you seem to be focused on this idea that everyone in the market is in direct competition with each other. It doesn't make any sense. It is entirely possible that the actions of a large scale manipulator could simultaneously benefit both themselves and me. It's entirely possible that the actions of a large scale manipulator could benefit both themselves and *the market as a whole*. I'll try saying this one last time, cuz you seem kinda dumb: **NOT ALL MARKET MANIPULATION IS A BAD THING.**
It is especially amusing that you started this conversation off by telling me my views were 'narrow' since it has become increasingly clear that you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-08-22 16:47:08
I do **not** agree that mining won't fall if the economic incentive decreases. If the economic incentive changes then the number of people mining will absolutely change. The only reason this would be mitigated is by the number of miners who believe that mining and holding will result in profit at a later date - only a highly speculative segment of the population would fall in to this category.
This conversation began by me stating that a change in the **quantity of BTC in the block reward** will not necessarily correlate directly to a change in the value of the reward, as there are several more factors that influence the profitability of mining. Therefor, a block reward halving will not necessarily result in half the number of miners. Nothing about my statements were misleading or false. If the profitability of mining falls, so will the number of miners - that is the definition of supply and demand. If the **mining reward** falls, mining may very well be unaffected.
P. S. The phrase "patently false" means that you can prove something is false. You haven't proven anything.

Do NOT use this service! It is horribly designed and a huge pain in the ass. I get almost daily text alerts saying that the price of coin is $0.00. So, I get one text for every alert I set up below the current market value. Then when the program realizes that the price is $600, not $0, I get another set of texts for every alert that it passes on the way up.
e. g., "The price has fallen below your limit of $500 - the price is $0.00" ... "The price has passed your limit of $500 - the price is $595" ... I receive alerts like this constantly even though the price never actually changed enough to activate my intended alert (it was $595 the whole time).
This service has literally one function and it performs it so poorly that it quickly becomes a burden - not a convenience. STAY AWAY.

Okay - I can't really tell if you're trolling or just really struggling with this entire concept, but I'll respond either way. Let's try to keep this really simple:
You asked a very straightforward question:


You cannot buy things unless they are already owned. If you do not want to buy BTC from someone who already owns it (i.e. a middleman) then you need to get your BTC directly from the source (i.e. mining). I never said anything about profitability.
The reason people who own coins charge a fee for them is because they are absorbing the risk of fluctuating costs and providing you the service of convenient purchase. If you do not want to pay the fee for these conveniences then you need to go about things in a less convenient way - see: mining. You can't sell things at cost and still run a profitable business. This is not unique to Bitcoin, it is a fundamental principal of economics. Do you think the grocery store sells you produce for the same price for which they purchase it from farmer? You pay fees for everything you buy unless you are generating the product yourself.

That's a pretty bold assumption considering the mechanics of a blind auction where the winning bid will have the power to dictate market price. If I was a whale who was already holding a large amount of coin, I would happily bid over-market to increase the value of my already sizable holdings.

Have you considered the fact that a whale bidding under market value would literally cost themselves money if they are sitting on a reserve of coin? They would be devaluing their own holdings - heavily devaluing if they bid low enough to cause a minor crash. The only logical reason for someone to bid under market value, in this setting, is if they are brand new to the market and are buying a sizable amount of coin for the first time. One would assume that at least someone in this auction has a vested interest in seeing the price rise - and it only takes **ONE** bid above market to make sure this happens.

I'm afraid it's not that simple. Unless you have a money changing license and are doing a really good job of recording all these cash transactions and reporting them to the IRS (along with all relevant capital gains figures) there's a really good chance that you're breaking several federal laws (assuming you're located in the United States). Selling currencies is a complex issue, legally speaking. In the long run, unless you intend to operate as a criminal, you're going to have to provide the government with all the same sensitive identification information (and probably more) than you are required to provide to Coinbase. Also, you should know that providing this service makes you legally culpable for any crimes that are committed using your service. Meaning if I have you sell me coins so that I can launder money, YOU can be prosecuted for it. Even if you have no idea who I am or what I was planning to do with my coins. THIS is the reason coinbase requires identification and it is also the reason that any service that DOESN'T require identification is most likely breaking the law.
Your plan: operate independently, personally accept all transaction risk (being robbed, ripped off, extorted, etc.), as well as accepting all legal risk of prosecution for tax evasion, money laundering, etc.
My plan: use coinbase or circle. Tell them a few pieces of information that I already readily provide to dozens of institutions anyway (healthcare providers, schools, workplaces, etc.). Get coin quicker, cheaper and legally with less risk.

It's an over-simplified explanation. The network will only become half as secure after a halving if the price of coin remains constant. If, for example, the price of coin doubles by the time of the next halving the effect will be trivial.
If price moves in sync with difficulty, there will be no economic motivation to stop mining. The block reward simply needs to contain enough value to exceed mining expenses - it is irrelevant whether this value is delivered in 50, 25 or 12.5 BTC.

Most cryptocurrency companies will not be interested in someone with just financial talents/education - those types grow on trees these last 20 years or so and their financial skills won't aid in the fundamental understanding of cryptocurrencies and their respective technologies.

This. I don't know how Bitcoin became associated with wealth redistribution or "the democratization of money" as OP puts it (what does that even mean?).
Bitcoin was created to revolutionize the creation and transfer of wealth through a controlled supply and shared ledger. It was never intended to leave everyone on equal financial footing. The early adopters **deserve** to be rich - they took a much larger risk than people buying coin now. In fact, the early adopters are the reason Bitcoin survived the early development stage. They made a big gamble and they were *right*.

I totally agree with this. I have had multiple conversations with intelligent people who didn't even know you could purchase fractions of a coin. They assumed it was like stock, or physical coins and could only be purchased in full increments (you can't buy half of a penny, for example). As soon as they hear that each coin is $450+ they think it sounds ridiculous to buy.

@_date: 2014-12-18 17:29:50
You don't need to do the buybacks through any specific exchange. Just make sure to buy coin whenever you spend coin. This allows you to spread coin around the economy without ever decreasing the total market cap. It also encourages use/acceptance.
Also, all transactions increase or decrease price over time, whether they are off chain or not. If money enters the BTC economy at a faster rate than new coin is mined the price rises. This is true regardless of whether the coin changes wallets through a blockchain transaction or if the entire wallet is transferred to a new owner in an offline transaction.

I guarantee the people filling those roles at Coinbase and other similar companies have technical experience even if their current role doesn't directly require it. You can't have someone in a business development/legal/marketing role if they can't prove that they have a deep, comprehensive understanding of the technology the business specializes in. Similarly, the people filling these roles in engineering organizations *always* have some form of engineering education or qualifications in their background - these skills are required to oversee business management in specialized industries.
If you do not have technical skills and qualifications it will be very difficult for you to compete with other applicants who have obviously chosen cryptocurrency employers because they are passionate about/experienced with the technology. You need to distinguish yourself from the other hundred-million business graduates or you will not have any competitive advantage at all.

1) Closing costs are associated with LOANS - they do not impact the value of a house in anyway. If you have enough cash to purchase the house, then you will not need a loan and will not pay closing costs.  
2) Average closing costs are in the range of 2% - 5%, so if someone made you pay 8% you need to file a police report because you've been raped.  
3) Closing costs do not cause you to "lose" money on your home. If you buy a $200k home, you pay the purchase price and the closing costs and you now own a $200k house. In the case I am discussing above, the analagous situation would be purchasing a $200k house, paying the closing costs, and then having the house be worth $186k by the time you move in. This would be a terrible real estate investment.

But you knew where we were heading from day 1 - it wouldn't be a dangerous game for you.


What exactly are you referring to as "Day 1"? Because Bitcoin started at well under $1 so it can't have been dropping throughout its entire existence or we wouldn't be here having this conversation.
In fact, relative to 1 year ago today, Bitcoin is still up over 200% even after the recent drop.


Shouldn't you be telling me right now if we are going to get near $1000? You are the one who has had omniscient vision of Bitcoin's future from Day 1 (which apparently was less than a year ago, since "It's been dropping since").

Seriously? We were both on the same page about this a few comments ago - is this becoming a completely circular discussion? Let's try again, with emphasis: **JUST BECAUSE THE PRICE OF BITCOIN FELL DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE PROFITABILITY OF MINING FELL. IT IS DEPENDENT ON FAR MORE FACTORS THAT JUST THE PRICE OF A BITCOIN**


This is my exact original point - hence me telling you that you were agreeing with me and not realizing it. Please see emphatic comment, above.


He wouldn't necessarily stop mining, but he would be less motivated to mine. He may, consequently, be motivated to spend more of his electricity costs on other things that he considers to be more profitable. 
EXAMPLE 1: If I paid you $20 a day to do your job, and then you came in on Friday and I told you I was only going to pay you $10 would you just sit at your desk and accept that? No. You would refuse to work a full day. Or you would spend some of your workday looking for a new job that pays you what you're worth. Maybe you already have other job offers and you would walk out immediately. Only if you were entirely disenfranchised (had zero options - basically a wage slave) or stupid (don't understand basic economics) would this price change not affect your behavior in some way.
EXAMPLE 2: If a baker makes both bread and muffins, and one day the price of muffins gets cut in half, he may not stop baking muffins entirely, but you can rest assured he is either going to start making less muffins and more bread, or he is going to lose profits. Now consider the fact that electricity can generate profit in literally MILLIONS of ways - that's a lot of bread recipes.
Also, the scenario you've laid out is a poor example, because mining is currently NOT profitable and many things you can do with electricity ARE.


No I do not, and your condescension only makes you sound like a twat. I'll try to keep this simple:
Less profit from mining = less demand.
Less demand = less supply.
Smaller demand for mined coins results in fewer mined coins supplied.
This is **exactly** what the law of supply and demand describes. It is an incredibly basic economic concept and should not be difficult to grasp.

That seems like a **very** overly optimistic estimate. If even 100 billion were to enter the market by next year, price would rise to over $7k. I think it's unrealistic to expect that kind of growth within a year.

That aside, I personally think that $7k/coin is still 2-3 years off, and that's if things go very well. I would think that somewhere around $2k-3k is a more reasonable outlook for the next year, but still very optimistic.
@_date: 2014-08-22 17:25:22

Irrelevant to what? In a discussion involving a major institutional public auction of an openly traded commodity I would say price is pretty fucking relevant.
Especially considering these coins were won by a syndicate of average joes - not a single multi-millionaire. This means that everyone who won these coins is way more susceptible to downward market pressure than a rich investor would be. Which means if price drops significantly a bunch of these coins are going to be liquidated, which will cause a further collapse in price.
Not to mention that this is a major market event and the market's **immediate** response was to lose significant confidence in the commodity which dropped ~7% in value.
All of this is extremely relevant - there are just a bunch of douches in this sub who want to pretend that price is only an important indicator when it's giving good news. Get your head out of ~~the sand~~ your ass.

Wrong. Directly from Investopedia:
Deflation - A general decline in prices as compared to the value of a currency. Frequently caused by a reduction in the supply of money or credit, deflation can also be caused by **a decrease in government, personal or investment spending**.
A decrease in spending without a change in income = an increase in savings. Increased savings with declining prices leads to deflation. You should read into what you're talking about before trying to correct people, it makes you look a little foolish.

Contradiction one: you're a big believer but don't put you're money in. So you're a "big believer" but unwilling to support/adopt the technology until others accept the risk before you in the short/medium term? It is clear that if *no one* invests in the short or medium term the entire system collapses, so you must be counting on a lot of people to be bigger "believers" than you are.


Contradiction two: you stated above that you're not investing because you don't see any event "pushing up the price". As in you are waiting for some sign of new utility or adoption. Now you're saying you'd actually only be willing to invest if the price collapses to $100 - which is a strong signal that both utility and adoption are *failing*. That's backwards. What you're really saying is that you don't think BTC is worth any more than $100 to you. Again, I question how much of a believer you can be if you think coin is worth so little.


Contradiction three: if Bitcoin succeeds, minor fluctuations in current price are irrelevant. However, you're still waiting for current prices to fluctuate just the way you want them before buying. You're standing on both sides of the argument. If you believe in coin, current price doesn't matter. If you're so worried about current price that you won't buy coin, you can not possibly be a "big believer". 


Contradiction four: "Can't predict the future." Immediately attempts to predict the future in the next sentence.

Your analogy is fundamentally flawed. On one hand you are analyzing a commodity and in your example you are discussing a service industry.
Credit cards (and credit card companies) are a financial lending/credit service. There are many advantages to using these services: they often simplify purchasing processes, offer rewards programs, and (as you said) they can mitigate risk. There are also many disadvantages to using these services: payments are delayed (if you accept cc payments you won't actually receive the money for 3-5 days), the services are expensive (cc fees are significant), and the service provider can dictate where you're allowed to spend your funds (Visa has the power to review and deny any potential spending - for example international purchases or gambling). All of these are reasons that many small businesses cannot afford the services of a credit card company (again, remember that credit card companies offer a service, not a tradable commodity).
Bitcoin is a freely traded, controllable commodity or currency. Bitcoin is not a service that charges fees, or a company that offers credit loans. It is something that can be gathered and spent in a "push payment" system. These are all properties of fiat currencies - not financial services. Bitcoin is NOT analogous to credit cards - it is analogous to Internet cash.
Instead of comparing the experience of purchasing a game on steam with a credit card, you should ask yourself: would it ever be useful for me to pay for an online service like steam with cash? In your example above you stated that credit cards offer you a better value because steam might not be trustworthy enough to deliver you a working product and you can chargeback. But at the same time, by the very nature of paying with a credit card, you are sharing loads of private identification information with a company that you don't even trust to deliver you a working video game. In many cases cash transactions are less risky, and in every case cash transactions are cheaper because you don't have a credit/lending service acting as a middle man. Think of all the small businesses that currently exist who are unable to afford credit card processing fees.
Also, remember that credit card companies could easily exist in the Bitcoin ecosystem just as they exist in the Australian economy and American economy, etc. Credit card companies are lending services established on top of existing currencies. They could just as easily be established within the Bitcoin infrastructure in the future. VISA lends you Australian dollars - it lends me US dollars - in the future it could lend us both BTC.

You definitely did, because the original comment had nothing to do with the different applications of gold vs. Bitcoin


That is absolutely not true. If people bought gold no matter what, then the price of gold would never go down, only rise. This is obviously not the case.


There is literally nothing in existence that people will buy "regardless of price". The literal concept of price refers to the limit of what people will pay.


You don't think it was the price, you just think it was the fact that the price rose quickly? So... Basically it was the price.


Merchant acceptance has nothing to do with this particular discussion so I'll just ignore this nonsense.




You need to step back and think about what you're trying to argue here. Does it honestly make sense to you that drastically decreasing the value of a good would make the public more interested in it? You have the economics of perception completely turned around. If you go to the average consumer and tell them your product was worth $1000 last year but is only worth $200 now, they're not going to say, "Oh what a great buying opportunity!" They're going. To say, "Why is your product 1/5 as valuable as it was last year?"
High priced items are high priced because they are valuable. Having a high price on bitcoins will clearly communicate to the consumer public that Bitcoin has lots of value. Having a sharply declining price that bottoms out somewhere much lower will not increase adoption it will scare off new users.

This isn't accurate.
The number one historical cause of deflation is saving - people voluntarily removing their own wealth from circulation. If everyone believes BTC's value will continue to rise then they will spend less and save more. As the price of goods/commodities drops in comparison this imbalance becomes self-perpetuating and a deflationary spiral forms where no one wants to spend a currency that may be worth more tomorrow.
Looking at the basic economics of BTC, this deflationary scenario seems inevitable to me, and it is one of the reasons that I believe BTC's future is as a store of value rather than a global spending currency.  
tl;dr - deflation occurs without the loss or destruction of currency and the BTC ecosystem will undoubtedly experience it at some point.

You have to remember that it's not a balanced-odds bet. The $100M gambler has an incredibly high probability of getting his money back, while the BTC gambler is pretty much guaranteed to lose thousands of dollars. So, it's still nothing like breaking even - it's more like buying a $2375.19 powerball ticket.
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:06:01


That's... not what breaking even means. If you lost, he would take the 8.334 bitcoins that you are currently putting in cold storage. Meaning you would lose out on the present value of your coins, equal to:
8.334*$285 = $2,375.19
Losing $2,375.19 doesn't sound like breaking even to me.

Credit card fees are much higher than 1% - people just don't think about it because the fees are leveed on the vendor and therefor built in to the price of what you are purchasing (plus they like to give you "miles" and "cash back" so you don't realize you're spending more than you need to).
Once you remove the CC fees vendors are able to sell goods at a discount compared to normal card sales - this is why merchants who adopt coin are able to offer discounts with it (e.g., 5% off bitcoin purchases). Bitcoin removes cost from the entire transaction process, increasing profits for vendors and decreasing prices for consumers.
So 1% on coin purchases is actually significantly cheaper in the long run.

If no one was buying the price would be zero. As it is, thousands and thousands of coins are being sold and purchased everyday (3600 coins added to the economy daily) and each one is still worth multiple hundreds of dollars.
Edit: For perspective - consider that in order to maintain a price over $200 per coin, a **minimum** of $720,000 outside dollars must be invested in the Bitcoin economy every day. That rate equates to over a quarter of a billion dollars in new coin purchases annually. And that's only when we're exactly at $200, which is essentially the lowest price in well over a year. Bitcoin is still in a stage of massive inflation - a constant price, or even a slowly declining one, means there's lots of money flowing in to the system.

You're making a circular argument. You entered the conversation saying that you new exactly what was going to happen in the bitcoin market and that you predicted it and "have been trying to tell us" since the beginning.
Now you end the conversation by saying the market is insanely volatile and that you don't know what the price will be in the future.
I don't give a fuck about what you think of the technology - that's none of my concern. Volatility is the mechanism that creates profit opportunities - that's what I care about. If you really knew what you were talking about, you could easily profit from it. But as soon as you state that you've "always" known this was going to happen, you turn around and say it would be a crazy gamble to put money on it. So, I guess back to my original point - you're full of shit. You just noticed a price drop and jumped online to claim that you knew it was going to happen in the hopes of beings as condescending as possible to a group of people you seem to have an inexplicable disdain for.

So burning one pound of coal would release enough energy to perform over 25 quadrillion hashes. Which means the entire decentralized, global payment system could be run on a single furnace that burns 8 lbs of coal a second. That is INSANELY energy efficient.

You're completely missing the point. Bitcoin **DOES NOT require the internet**. Bitcoin only requires a) processing equipment necessary to perform the hashing functions and b) any form of technology that allows you to mass broadcast information. The internet is just one form of such technology. Radio is another form (and a much cheaper and more broadly implemented one, for the record).


Of course the internet will always form the backbone *as long as it is the most efficient communication system*. My point is not that one day we won't use the internet for the blockchain - my point was that you don't **need** the internet to broadcast the blockchain. If some disaster were to compromise the international network for example, or if you are trying to broadcast transactions from a remote place that would be too expensive to wire to the internet, a radio transaction would be perfect. What if your government begins restricting your access to the internet as a private citizen? Having an increasing number of methods for transmitting the blockchain will always make the network more robust - without exception.


This is a complete non sequitur to the comments I have made and it doesn't make any sense. All a miner needs is a series of transactions to verify, the ability to perform hashing functions, and a method of broadcasting their proof of work. Literally everything else involved in the process is ancillary. 'Mining' could be performed by anyone with graph paper and a ham radio if they were patient enough.

1) You're making the assumption that he never sold or traded any during the massive run up, which seems pretty unlikely. That means him doubling his money is the *worst case scenario* here.
2) Even if he didn't sell you're talking about an annual return of 48% interest, compounded monthly, on his initial principle. That's an incredible investment.

What he actually said was:


My guess is his plans changed as the price did.

No - it's more like you're saying you need websites to share headlines. You're just being dense.

Please explain to me how you would spend cash anonymously

You're just focusing on one semantic detail of a specific definition of the word value. Value can also be defined as:


Which can absolutely exist inherently. In the context of investment, inherent value just means the opposite of speculative value. It's not an oxymoron - it's a real concept.

I feel like the distinction you're making is fairly meaningless - they are demonstrating the functionality of broadcasting payments over the radio. The system they have developed allows you to receive payments as a processor/merchant without having access to the Internet, which is where this discussion began. The only reason computers need to be connected on the back end is because everyone else is currently broadcasting the blockchain over the internet. Once other forms of transaction transmission gain traction the back end computers connected to the web would be unnecessary - for example, you could just have a series of echoing radio broadcasts that span the globe. You would really only need 3-4 large AM-radio antennas to pull that off, with a handful of small, local FM towers wherever population centers exist.
Edit: There is also this -

Yes - transactions have also been broadcast over radio. was mistaken is his statement that Bitcoin relies on the Internet. However, it does rely on expensive processing equipment.

Again, you are focusing only on a single aspect of this definition - in this case, importance.
Usefulness, on the other hand, is not purely a judgement value. Metals are useful because they are conductive. Fuels are useful because they are combustible. These properties are not judgments or opinions, they are facts, and these properties bring value to these substances. **Inherent** value.
I'm sorry that you don't understand what people mean when they say inherent value, but that doesn't make them wrong when they use the phrase.

No, I know - I'm not doubting that position at all. It seems like your comment was a genuine, non-antagonistic contribution to the discussion. That's what I mean. You're a wild card.

I've successfully ordered from them multiple times so I can confirm they are not a scam operation - although they should definitely be handling their communications with you more proactively.
