The market value of the derivative contracts is only 12.7 Trillion, but has a notional value of 540+ Trillion.

But yet even given his short blanket statement I knew exactly where he is coming from. Why? Because I have been learning form Buffett for a very long time.
Listen to what the man has to say. You may not agree with it and it probably won't make sense but shut the fuck up and listen, and then try to understand why he said it. He is imminently qualified to pass judgement on any *investment*, which is how he was responding to the questions. 
Buffett's investing style was born from Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. Read "The Intelligent Investor" and then ponder long and hard about bitcoin and how it relates. Then, you will understand where Buffett is coming from.

Yes. In the short term it might not be that notable, but on a longer time scale it works very well.
Or, if yo don't want to put all the work into it invest in brk-b or brk-a and let WB do the work.

Warren doesn't think bitcoin is a good investment for the same reasons he doesn't think gold is a good investment. There is no inherent value.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:32:37
Entirely too many, which is why this sub reddit is full of fucking morons quoting Buffet as if they actually know anything about him as an investor.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:46:33
It depends, are you smart enough to differentiate between "newspapers" and "local newspapers" as an investment?
There is an important difference, one that WB sees as a fundamental difference that makes one of those bad and the other good.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:26:13
It isn't a juxtaposition of anything, because in the eyes of WB it is not an investment at all.

I admire your attempt to bring some rational thought to the absolutely mind numbing stupidity in the thread. Nothing but downvotes for those that dont blindly follow the moral outrage.

"Look, we've reverted to the mean"! 
And that is why log charts are bullshit.

His opinion on whether it is an investment is most relevant however.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:27:29
It derives its value from the fact that it produces something, in the case of a company you are buying a share from the profit of production, as RghoNomic mentioned.
I use it interchangeably with 'intrinsic value' but my terminology, right or wrong is the basis for how WB values an investment.

You should read the annual shareholders letter, it explains precisely why what you said is a gross mis-characterization of what he really said, and what he really did.

It is the natural tendency for humans to try and find a pattern. In looking for a pattern they want to rationalize what they think they are seeing in a random sequence. Their bias will dictate what they label it.
In short; idiots.

Silver is almost exclusively used for industrial purposes, which is the exact inverse for gold.
His choice to buy silver doesn't make him a hustler, it demonstrates that you know nothing about his investment philosophy.

That is not the sole criteria for a gamble.
Even if it were, the probability of bitcoin going to zero is not zero.
Either way, it's a gamble.
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:15:05
I didn't say you said that.
What I said was that reversion to the mean is going to happen. It has nothing to do with regression lines and more to do with things like 'as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow, this bitch will revert to the mean'.
At which point you will realize why log charts are not the shiznit.

Investing in cities via Municipal Bonds is the very essence of value investing, just on a scale that isn't related to a company.
The rest of your mess of a point has nothing to do with his investment philosophy. He makes money where he sees value. How he defines value would require a few weeks reading on your part, so get to work:

It is harder to track by using shell companies/trusts/foreign jurisdictions, but not impossible.
If you manage to get the money into a foreign jurisdiction by bypassing the banking industry you need to get it back the same way, by physically moving cash, which is horribly inconvenient for large amounts.
Also, John McAffee is batshit crazy, anything he says needs to be taken with a grain of salt.

Peter "A broken clock is still right twice a day" Schiff.
He was once correct, and now he makes his money forecasting financial crashes. He is terrible and should be ignored.

It largely a matter of rate. You can quibble over the terms but shedding 80+% of its value in a short period of time is a crash in the financial world.

I do not need to protect my wallet, as it does not contain my entire store of dollars. If it is stolen/destroyed i will be merely mildly inconvenienced. Minimal security precautions are all that is required.
It would be a shame to build a digitally secure system only to have it carried away or destroyed.

I think the statement that inflation is neutral refers to the neutrality of money.
Cantillon theorizes on what causes inflation, but the author is referring to the effects of inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:58:05


Relative to its initial value you could say it rose 5000% and then fell 5000% back to zero. That would be tracking its performance.
Or if you were speaking of its value you could say it rose 5000% and then lost all (100%) of its value.
Neither one is incorrect, just a different way of expressing it.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:00:34
Perhaps, but I think the authors stance is that inflation has no effect on GDP, employment or consumption.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:45:08
Since there has never been a case of exponential growth of a investment/monetary sytem/medium of exchange that I have ever heard of that has not reverted to the mean, I'm going with "yeah, it's going to crash".
"It's different this time" has never really panned out when it comes to exponential growth and these types of things.

Since you don't understand what mean is either...it isn't based on future anything. It's the historical average.

Key point: Without additional money, either in the form of more deposits or Dividend Reinvestments, there is no compounding. 
If you just let money sit there without adding to it the value  will follow a linear rate of return.

For determining an investment return, that is true most of the time. Leveraged investments can lose more than their value but we aren't talking about that.
I'll try an dig up an example that made me think of it. It's not how I would express it but I have seen graphs that were relative percentages, ie, price goes from 1 to 100 and then back down to 1. On such a graph visually you could interpret it as a 9900% decrease even though mathematically it doesn't make much sense.

Also know this...you are looking for a way to predict the future. I think you can recognize that trying to do so will result in frustration.

It isn't an actual graph based on data. Please don't tell me you think that is supposed to be real.

And it will revert to the mean, again. The mean may increase but it is a certainty that value and mean will meet again.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:42:59
The graph isn't shit, you don't know what it means.
The most important part of that graph is at the end. Where we are now doesn't matter, but history indicates that a reversion to the mean will most certainly happen.
