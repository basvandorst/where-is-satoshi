I don't think that's quite right.18 U.S. Code § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television says:


It doesn't say the fraud needs to be successful. I'm not a lawyer though.

I've never heard this idea applied to patents but the "poor man's copyright" trick has been around for a long time.  The US Copyright office says this method is not legally sound and that you should still register copyrights if you want this kind of protection (which is really just sticking an official date on your copyright in case there could be doubt about who created a work first).
If you make your idea sufficiently public (enough that a court would agree the idea was known prior to the granting of a conflicting patent) you don't—in theory—need to register a patent (so long as you don't care about obtaining a monopoly on the idea).  And you never really need to register a copyright as copyright is implicitly granted the second the work is made.

Pretty hilarious that someone would argue that something isn't *Turing* Complete when Alan Turing himself was who wrote a proof of the Halting Problem for general algorithms 80 years ago. Going further, I submit that no language is turing complete because of the eventual heat death of the universe.
