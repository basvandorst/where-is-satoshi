Little confused over here. While I do like Andreas, I'm a little surprised that he sounds really confident saying the Ethereum fork "went as planned" despite naysayers "whining".
How do his statements reconcile with the less than ideal reality we now see of two competing forks, ETC &amp; ETH, with bickering and divisiveness in the Ethereum community?

Does anyone have knowledge on which legal jurisdiction Bitfinex (iFinex, Inc) falls into?
The company is incorporated in BVI (British Virgin Isles), but it's office is in Hong Kong.

Advisors to startups are typically not employees nor usually compensated in salary. They could receive soft benefits, and perhaps advisor shares in the entity if anything.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:19:02
Well, you seem to be quite certain he is compensated. My own view is rather agnostic, he may or may not be compensated. I simply don't know. 
Though it doesn't appear like there is any hard evidence either way. 
But I do want to point out again, being an employee and an advisor assumes a different power structure, to what you were asserting is the case here: 


Advisors usually have more autonomy, and in many cases even more autonomy or prestige than the CEO herself.

actually the truth is a little more nuanced.
the "Nobel Prize in Economics" is in fact awarded by *Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel*, which like the other Nobel prizes is chosen by the *Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences*.
the bank does indeed fund the award though. also a major point of contention was that the economics prize was introduced 73 years later, and was not part of Alfred Nobel's original prizes setup upon his death and outlined in his will.

Well, spamming the blockchain for one as well as confusing regular traders with noise in the market. 
For example, a new install of Bitcoin-QT today takes 4 hours (I know this because I reinstalled yesterday). By next month it could be a few days. Of course there are other hosted options.. and clients like [Electrum]( but I feel that hosting is moving back towards centralization, which increases risk again.
While work is supposedly being done to mitigate this, botnets and high frequency trades are significant problem.
What if a million headed botnet, decided to do a serious attack on bitcoin for weeks causing exponential growth in transactions?
We need to think longterm. Insufficient risk mitigation and "what if " scenario planning, leads to crashes and slowdowns.

E-ventures is [legit]( 
Whether that email actually comes from them, well that's another story. Luckily for you, it's also easy to verify. Maybe pickup the phone and call them asking to speak to the alleged contact?
Obviously though, use the number from the website, not the one in the email. ;)

Good advice. Long timer LP user and evangelist here. One thing that still bugs me however is a single master password.
It may be nice to have an optional secondary password for a second line of defense (eg on certain high security notes).

pity it didn't work out. though... not sure how useful the inflammatory anti-government rhetoric is.
bitcoin is used by people across the globe from all cultures and ideologies. let's not try push an agenda.
hope bitcoin moves forward as a neutral technology (eg tcp/ip) that everyone can use. not saying abandon one's own personal beliefs, but honestly think it will have a better chance of success if we do that in the long run.
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:38:12
thats good advice..thanks for sharing :)
pains me greatly to see people loosing their BTC due to browser exploits and thieving scum
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:25:26
Yeah totally. So perhaps the folks that run the 'howto' guides and other community sites, should start promoting some other exchanges over mtgox?  yah know... just to even it out a bit. :D
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:40:31
now i'm curios to what OP said :D

Pricing items for sale in BTC is silly, given the currency's relative infancy.
While it may look cool to see the Bitcoin symbol next to an amount, sites should be *pricing* in USD (while trading in BTC in the background). At least until BTC is a much larger market cap and more stable.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:37:02


I'm not sure I get it either.. or expressing myself well. Clearly :)
Transaction fees I think are an interesting and evolving problem, but I'm not convinced that will stop abuse altogether. They also move a wealth back to the mining pools right?
Are we going to see a visa/mastercard like cartel emerging? Impossible right?

MtGox has 20k of AML accounts (I'm one of them in the queue). Granted not all of those are &gt;$50k but I'd guess at least half are. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:24:16
Mt Gox officially denied they were DDOS'd on their FB page. Was there a DDOS or not... anyone know?

Great story, thanks for sharing :)

Oh how fickle the herd can be.
This post is classic pessimistic overreaction to the crowd exuberance of yesterday. Bookmark and come back in two days. 
There are 20 000 AML Mt Gox accounts just dying to put money in... I'd wage at least $500m+ is waiting to go in.

Looking good, congrats :). That's a serious number of TPS and the CPU cache method you explained in the hangout is pretty neat.
So in terms of future plans, you might want to consider dark pools, options, margin trade, multi-currency etc.
Also it might be good to abstract matching strategies, so multiple could be implemented.

*"This should be a huge win for everyone — faster deposit and withdrawal times, easier-to-reach customer service, and better access for United States financial markets, market makers and liquidity providers"*
 - Mark Karpeles on the Coinlab deal in Feb 2013
wow guys...
little surprised reddit is making mtgox out to be heroes. if anything it feels a bit slimey on their part. mark made a deal and signed it. then it appears he realizes: "hey we can just keep the US accounts to ourselves". that may not be the case, but he is not denying it. all this is after Peter spends time and money (his own and investors) in thinking there is a real deal on the cards...
don't think peter's a saint either btw, but some balance might be nice?

So far they seem pretty good/professional.
At one point they were cheaper than Mt Gox for buying. But now looks like arb'ing (or something else) has equalized things.

Yeah Prolexic is the real deal, but pricey too. It works at the BGP level. Essentially gives you a "clean pipe". 
Cloudfare is ok, but kind of annoying for end users : "Checking your browser before accessing"

While I agree with your criticism that perhaps the OP presents his/her case over-confidently...


The same could be said of your dismissal.
What is "general economic theory"? Does that even makes sense in global holistic way? For example Keynesian is popular with the current US administration. I'm not sure it represents universal economic "facts", or that a worldwide consensus even exists.

mmm I dunno man. I get the feeling that if comeone has the skill to pull off a DDOS, they probably also have enough technical chops to buy and hold bitcoin and profit in the long run.

@_date: 2013-04-22 01:56:01
I wonder where he went and why? The Bitcoin world would benefit greatly from his ongoing participation.
His last post states this, I found it rather telling:
- Added some DoS controls
As Gavin and I have said clearly before, the software is not at all resistant to DoS attack.  This is one improvement, but there are still more ways to attack than I can count.

Sell? I held and bought *more*.
it's easy to loose sight of the long term potential with the current temporary loss of enthusiasm and media attention. This pessimistic bubble will pop too, and the cycle will repeat. The difference is bitcoin overall will go up. This has happened many times already.

Yeah I was watching that trollbox too. Crazy hype going on
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:22:56
Yeah, it could be way worse. But check this out.
That is not linear growth.. only going to get worse with more exchanges if people de-risk away from Mt Gox.

hey folks. I'm a contributor to the buttercoin project. Paul's (enki23) taking some downtime so I'll respond.
Please note someone already tried to create a fake Bitcoinstarter project under the buttercoin name earlier today. Luckily it was caught in time before it went live! This looks like another attempt by these people (on 4chan this time) to cash in on donations.
Please do not send coins to the fake 4chan address (the yellow part in the OP's image) or donate at all if you don't want to. The original Reddit post has the real address though, if you do.
From the beginning the feeling has always been more of a "tip if you support buttercoin" kind of an idea, as opposed to trying to make money off it.

Coinbase are handling this badly. But did they really *steal* 2 BTC? Maybe you're overstating the case?
The way I'm reading it (I hope for Coinbase's sake) is that they allow you to "spend" money you didn't have. So essentially they loaned you 2BTC.
At least it appears that's what they are saying.
