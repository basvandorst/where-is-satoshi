It’s called that so Hitler could undermine and co-opt actual socialism. *National socialism* is not the same as *socialism*.

Leave the poor guy alone, he’s never seen one before.

Because he thought he was getting free money with no risk.

Not everyone is in the US. Some of us don’t have a lot of options.

Sadly not an option everywhere.

Interestingly I went for a job interview with these guys a few weeks ago. I aced their prac test and am exceptionally well qualified. The interview seemed like a lock. I later was told they thought I wouldn't be "a good fit". 
As best I can tell the fact that I expressed concerns and reservations about policies and practices in general, and Mark's attitudes in particular made me "unsuitable".
Bullet dodged.

No. My interview was a front-end developer position, and the core of the application was an interface design - some basic jquery in a bootstrap interface. My attempt was the best they got. But web dev is a **secondary** skill for me. I'm actually a highly experienced back-end programmer in PHP, which is what Mt Gox is built in. 
I thought this would make me a great asset. Instead I think it made me a threat. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:21:11
Ok, that's great. Thanks. As best I can tell, that would make a number of roughly:
    1/2,002,312,200,000,000,000,000,000
A close enough humanesque number to that is around 150 billion^2. Cool!
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:41:38
I'm not sure I read your number correctly. Are you saying 1/1e16?, ie
That would seem crazily low... That's 1 in a trillion. And the network is currently doing five million trillion hashes a second. Are we talking about very different numbers or am I missing something really fundamental?
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:59:21
Hm. Ok, thanks. I'm afraid I don't actually know what that means. It seems like this answer is beyond my understanding of the math involved. How do I know the "number of leading zeros in the desired hash"? Is it 255?

There’s a weather service in my country that’s become a bit of a joke for apocalyptic mega-storm predictions. I read someone on Reddit saying they have an amazing record, they’ve predicted 26 of the last 12 storms. 
This guy sounds the same. He’s predicted 154 of the last three crashes.

Yes. I too have $13 worth of Bitcoin.

Excuse my ignorance but what’s the benefit of cbp? I suspect at least for me the ID process would likely make it impossible, and I’m ok with the moderate fees.

Online polls are always trustworthy. No one ever brigades or manipulates them. Because the internet is always reliable and honest.

They interviewed me for that article. I'm pretty sure it was that one. I posted about it on Facebook and a journalist (friend of a friend, iirc) asked me for a statement. This was years ago now so I can't say for sure it was for that article, but it seems likely.
And I know this stuff because the guy who interviewed me told me. I got the impression he was struggling against an entrenched culture of bad code and practises. He looked at me as someone who could be an ally in implementing and advocating the sort of things he wanted to do. 
It's worth pointing out conversations like this are not at all uncommon in a tech interview. People are often pretty open about the shortcomings in their practices because they don't want to give false expectations and actively want to change. 
Honestly hadn't realised this was such a controversial statement. I wouldn't have bothered commenting if I realised what a bunch of BS would spin out of it. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:26:42
This is hardly inner workings. This is Joel Test stuff. The guy who interviewed me really wanted me on board and was very open. Mark nixed me.
I don't really think you have any knowledge of this industry if you think this stuff is some sort of secret insider shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:05:22
Technical shit, not anything regulatory or anything. More specifically issues with access to version control repositories (devs couldn't commit to it), a complete lack of unit testing (not insufficient - none at all), no process for code review, pull requests, continuous integration or any other formal QA process. 
None of this is acceptable in a financial system. Combined with a codebase largely built by an egotistical "entrepreneur" who considered himself a genius programmer... it was a recipe for disaster. And... then a disaster. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:33:19
I don't know who this person is but he's carried a weird grudge a hell of a long time. I've responded to a previous attack at length here. 
I'm 99% sure it's the same bitter idiot. Basically a group of journalists don't like him because he's an asshole. So he treats it like some conspiracy. None of which has a damn thing to do with the time I interviewed at Mt Gox.
There's something kind of weird and sad about holding such passionate dislike for someone who literally doesn't know who you are. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:39:58
I try to explain and I'm "trying too hard" and proving I'm a liar. I don't try to explain and it's proof I'm a liar. 
Again, nothing talked about wasn't things I've discussed at other interviews. It was relatively unremarkable in that sense. The only difference was that the software **should** have been way more secure, and that there was a likely difficulty changing it.
But you're right, it really doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:56:40
Fun fact, I actually interviewed for a job at Mt Gox just a few weeks before the shit hit the fan. I aced all their tech requirements, but when I raised concerns about some of their standards and practices, Mark decided I wasn't a "good fit" or a "team player" or some shit.
Bullet dodged!
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:35:35
I don't know. You're just shifting the goalposts now.
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:19:33
He didn't catch anything. It might be the same info from a different source - they had a fair few devs - or possibly even from me directly.
I've replied already. It took me a while because I was doing other shit.

This is a bit of a silly question isn’t it? Cryptos were all at an ATH literally daily for about 6 months. The question then becomes either “why didn’t you buy in 2014?” Or “why didn’t you have magical super powers and know it would go down”?
Neither of these seem to me like useful questions. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 06:52:17
I get what you’re saying but I can’t help thinking this is a sour grapes reaction, not a sincere one. When it finally IS approved people will fall all over themselves to say how this is huge, and such a big deal, etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 04:01:44
They did not. They saw the big % and wanted their no-risk free money.
