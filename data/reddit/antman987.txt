Using this logic, and it's great logic, is bitcoin still good as an investment?
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:02:20
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:07:54
Never below 8k again
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:14:52
Good for you. I noticed chain link is "off the hook" why is it new/cool/good performing? I just saw it a couple weeks ago i think
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:54:05
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:34:57
Just so everyone knows. Things were fishy buying with bitcoin. Probably because i bought at 10k, and it dropped to 9.5k. But anyways, they ended up honoring it. After several days. All good. But I'll never do that again with them

Do you use silver to buy anything?
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:55:21
Yeah. Did that. I've been ignored by support before, i am hoping they contact me back. If they don't, i wanted to know if anyone else has had this problem. Paying btc for items on apmex and having trouble. If so how did they fix it.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:04:24
Weekends used to go up. Now they go down. I think this weekend it may go up again. ... ...
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:15:56
I would like to use my ledger, but don't really know how, and it didn't come with a phone to phone cable either... I would like to also make a paper wallet, but also don't really know how. I usually fumble around to do tech stuff, like jailbreak a phone or hack my nintendo wii several years ago, but i don't want to mess up hard or soft wallets. Any fool proof how to instructions that are idiot proof out there?

@_date: 2019-07-18 22:09:57
No. Tomorrow is different. It will be a big weekend
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:55:46
You certainly have the safeguards in place.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:45:55
I appreciate the tip. I understand that. I have multiple platforms. Robinhood has its place in my lineup.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:07:24
Dunno what to say.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:14:46
I didn't sell all of it. Just enough to make it spike for everybody.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:55:16
I did this for several years. It worked fine. Now i went paper etc.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:49:23
Yup, you're right. I'll probably buy tomorrow after 3pm, we'll see what happens
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:52:10
Sold last night. Then bam it went up right away. That works everytime. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:36:20
Yeah. It totally did.
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:16:12
I dunno. Just a feeling i guess
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:54:05
I don't like how it goes up sharply.
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:27:32
Gold is the best, not even close, even if btc goes to the moon for 150 years then plummets, bankrupting the world. Gold Will still be real. Imo
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:16:02
Even more price manipulation than there is now?
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:52:19
I'm going for a Model T. With btc on the plate. Should run me about12.5k
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:12:42
Is bitcoin a good bet for an American, with all that being said?
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:57:00
.01 btc isn't enough?
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:22:27
It was positive what he said. They will regulate it. It will be fine
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:03:58
Easy champ. We all have bitcoin. Also I want the dollar and market to do well. I want America to do well.
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:53:09
Probably tesla though
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:35:17
I have it. I believe im getting crushed in it. Why would you want in right now
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:52:14
I thought about going all in. I have 100k in equity through my house. I am nervous about the u.s. declaring war on crypto. I'd go partially into gold. This certainly does look like a pivitol point on the btc chart though. I hope you do well.
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:05:26
Until next month i suppose
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:55:46
Volume=manipulation. imo
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:34:00
Gold Will still be valuable; even after the inevitable rise then fall of crypto. . let's face it, crypto is awesome, but it can and will be used as spyware for our finances. Then it will be used to bankrupt the world. .. You heard it here first. You're welcome.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:06:02
It should go up, But price manipulation might break us all
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:52:44
What does it mean
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:41:35
I have alot of gbtc, i wonder if holding it for long term is smart
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:08:27
Should wise men sell?
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:00:59
Stealing all my money and my children's money. Scammers
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:29:37
What does this mean. Better or worse stock price?
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:48:13
I agree. With this post
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:56:11
I'm in same predicament. Not sure when to pull it and transfer funds to Coinbase and then to other wallet. I think i will try to buy on Coinbase when i get paid, then sell that amount on robinhood and wait to transfer to my bank. Then i can slowly transfer the funds.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:00:35
I thought the fed created bitcoin to curb the eventual dominance of the yuan.
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:02:42
I have 20k in gbtc.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:07:42
Is that tax money for your babies future
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:57:52
Volume could be selling right?
@_date: 2019-10-23 01:00:45
They talked and it tanked. They could continue to crush it, or it might take off. I remember Mnuchin saying something about fannie may and freddie mac when he was in his last job, he turned out to be a liar. Sooo, I am hoping when he said we wont even be talking about bitcoin in 5 years,... That will be a lie too. Just my 2 cents, with alot riding on it.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:36:10
I just got the s. With no idea how to utilize it. Haha
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:24:42
Adapting the world economy to the internet revolution?
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:55:22
Wow. Interesting
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:30:31
G20 summit on Friday will be taking about "transforming global currency to include internet data revolution" that's a loose quote, but that's part of the agenda item.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:25:15
Data revolution...
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:30:10
Will this be like gbtc
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:05:00
I would buy gold with bitcoin earnings. Bitcoin will take us to the future, but gold will bring us to the end...... Haha haha hahaha.
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:25:25
Its a Wallet app i downloaded 2years ago and it's held some bits with no issue ever since
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:17:08
Save for children. Also spend on gold/silver.
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:25:26
All stable coins. All blockchain. All currency spyware. That's my predictions.
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:41:11
And when these people can monitor every transaction from one source. Will it still be the gospel? I wonder if it will be used against us.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:42:30
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:25:38
High volumes turn into low btc price. Historically
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:43:18
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:42:02
Blockchain is cool, but would make excellent fiscal spyware.
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:57:30
Where did this come from?
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:24:58
Rigged to suppress or rigged to pump up?
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:26:00
Unless of course they print the paper and i see each peak is lower than the previous peak. But I'm still in and ive got it all riding on it.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:10:06
Could be true
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:51:27
It may go lower
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:18:54
Why buy now?
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:10:53
Unlimited dollars=unlimited opportunity
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:38:50
I hope you are right
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:33:15
Isn't this what it takes to keep the price low? Like what was done with precious metal
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:11:34
Fed runs the world. Seems possible at least
@_date: 2019-09-12 02:08:07
The federal reserve will continue to drop the btc price through manipulation to save the u.s. dollar, sell your bitcoin now to accumulate real assets like real estate...
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:06:18
2 large banks just were fined for manipulation of precious metals market, so yes this will happen
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:04:40
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:12:25
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:58:34
Im all in. I also believe it will plummet
