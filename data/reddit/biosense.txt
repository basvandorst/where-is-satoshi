The podcast is hilarious. These guys have not updated their talking points to match reality.  They hoped Ethereum would be destroyed by the support for ETC.  Their talking points were to say "this shows us how dangerous things are" and they go full-speed ahead with that message...
Except, the ETC situation shows the exact opposite! The fork, even though flawed, did NOT destroy value, and it did NOT destroy ethereum.  If anything it has increased, if not created, the interest in forking bitcoin.
Unintended consequences have bit these guys badly. They're left there stuttering the party line when its now patently wrong for all to see.

It's one per unique txin, so you could say a "multiplier" exists because the respend, as a complete transaction, may be very large.  The change includes a rate limiter to deal with this DoS attack.

The network drops double-spends and doesn't propagate them, so monitoring for them actually requires a separate monitoring network, which multiple companies have now built (chain, mycelium...).

I prefer to see the bitcoin cryptosystem as logically separate from the blockchain and network.
Sure, the cryptography (which isn't innovative) has to be exactly right.   But then you hear statements like "consensus is totally deterministic" which the timestamp rules clearly disprove.
The stochastic blockchain is the real innovation of bitcoin, and extending closed-world, bit-for-bit cryptographic thinking to it ignores reality and leads to fear-driven discourse.

To verify that a double-spend was attempted, you need to have the signatures and be able to verify them.  In other words, you need the entire transaction.

Oh, I see it now.  The comments in this thread make it crystal clear.
This is just a garden variety power struggle.
nullc gives every sign of resenting Gavin's leadership, not because of its quality, or any big problem with a minor block size bump, but because he wants that power himself.  He doesn't want to work with Gavin - and it sure looks like that's simply because he doesn't want Gavin to succeed.
What I don't understand is... didn't Gavin appoint him to be a core committer?  And if so, can't he UN-appoint him?
If so, that recommends Gavin's leadership even more!
Instead of canning the guy, as any CEO would do, Gavin is so dedicated to the open source process that he would rather fork his own project to implement this change, which ANYBODY ELSE could also do, and NOBODY ELSE has bothered to come anywhere close to putting in the work to do.
No other putative leader has yet come anywhere close to displaying the qualities that make an effective decision-maker for bitcoin's overall technical direction.

@_date: 2015-08-29 19:32:23
jonny1000, the reasoning you cite totally misses the mark.  Here's why:
The "marginal cost of including a transaction" is a *derivative with respect to blocksize*.  Pinna computes an optimal blocksize relation and then uses it to examine the question of miner centralization.
The *equilibrium network difficulty* is not even discussed in this paper, which assumes constant exchange rate, and constant network hashrate H.  Clearly that equilibrium is heavily influenced by the exchange rate and obviously, the greater the exchange rate, the greater the equilibrium network hashrate (or equivalently, difficulty).  
This paper separates out very different quantitative factors that have led to confused thinking thus far.

Lamentably, your response poorly evaluates the proposal.
Regrettably, your conflicts of interest seem to blind you to the realities of the ecosystem.
Ironically, your own company contributes to failure modes introduced by the recent evolution of the network.
Users should trust miners less than the p2p network.  The recent BIP66 soft fork debacle, a miserably failed upgrade attempt, is clear evidence of that.
Blockstream greatly enables the practice of SPV mining that enabled this failure, by providing a fast UNVALIDATED and CENTRALIZED relay between miners.
Given the lower deserved trust, users should expect miners to offer a transaction submission service for a lower price than independent nodes.  Why doesn't this happen much already?  One reason is because miners themselves value the p2p network's role in validating incoming traffic.
A rational miner should never be happy with transmitting a found block only to a few other miners, for many reasons.  He doesn't really know where the rest of the miners are.  Other miners have a disincentive to further relay the block.  Users without the block can create invalid transactions.  Etc.

The trouble with using nLocktime it's not granular enough.  A "cancel button" for bitcoin should be available for about 15 seconds.

It's not BACKED unless you can REDEEM it.  That's what "backed" means.

The bitcoin transfer cannot be repudiated once confirmed.  The paypal payment, made in exchange for it, can be.

Peter R makes no such assumption.  He focuses on the decisions made by block producers.
May I never learn the language of intellectual arrogance ("sigh" "misguided" etc.)  Has it occurred to you that the reason others don't insult you is not that you are superior, but that they are polite?
The decision of whether to fill a block with unrelayed transactions, and how many, is up to each individual block creator.  If he chooses many (creates an "attack block"), he has high orphan risk cost.  If he chooses none, he has negligible orphan risk cost.  As you helpfully point out, the relay network extends the feasible blocksize that has negligible orphan risk cost.
If you're claiming that some miner's big block mysteriously makes other miners want to band together, well I'm afraid you might have to publish some academic research on the subject, as Peter R has done.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:57:33
As a solution to selfish mining, limiting block size is pretty poor.  It can only affect the seriousness of the attack, and not whether it works or not.

Transactions have ~10 minutes to propagate.  One packet is sub-second.
So it's 3 orders of magnitude.

Guys like nullc and petertodd seem to want to invent things for sheer glory.  They don't demonstrate interest in bitcoin being successful.  Their actions suggest all they care about is *their changes to bitcoin* being adopted, which increases their claim on Satoshi's creation.
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:58:09
... in which case, Peter R's calculations apply.
Good thing for you this is buried in a comment.
It's pretty clear that bigger blocks pose no orphaning problem worth whining about -- because either there is very low orphan risk (cooperating miners), or because orphan risk makes it uneconomical to include low-fee-paying transactions (non-cooperating miners).
So think about it again.  Why are you really doing this?
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:31:21
Actually OP is right.  Lightning depends on *A* blockchain, not necessarily *THE* blockchain.
Hubs could add support for multiple currencies and then slowly de-incentivise the old, original, "classic" bitcoin, maybe with discounts.
Then one day voila, due to popular demand, no more support for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-07 01:11:34
If this were true, I would expect that today large miners would be inserting lots of expensive-to-verify pay-to-self transactions into their blocks at the last minute.
The big pools don't do that.  For the same reason they don't create blocks larger than they need to.  They actually want everybody to be able to build on their block.  
Unbelievable, I know!

Then WHY are you and your colleagues making such a stink about "centralization" that arises from propagation time increasing for larger blocks?
I ask that you think about it.  Why on Earth are you doing this?

So an attacker has control of your online wallet.  And we are worried that he will use this power to sneakily hijack your coin selection algorithm to spend bigger inputs than he tells you he's spending, for the benefit of random miners?
In practice, he would simply replace the output address with his own, and hope you don't notice when signing.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:45:54
But this time they will succeed without miners because ... they will actually be stupid enough to try it?

No.  The money went to the actual Satoshi of course.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:43:03
They failed because less than 75% of mining supported the fork.
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:36:03
Brave words, coming from someone who's enjoyed the support of compliant miners to push out rule after rule on the rest of the network.
We've tried trusting developers to set the block size. That approach has failed.  Miners will do a better job.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:06:16
You're not thinking adversarially.  At its current market capitalization, Bitcoin could be cloned and out-funded by a large hedge fund or consortium.  To be secure from this, the price needs to rise two orders of magnitude.
Central banks will continue to be a threat until something on the order of a billion people own Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-18 16:41:23
So money center banks think blockchain is a solid technology.
Therefore, money center banks think the bitcoin currency is built on solid technology.
Thanks, money center banks!

There is one way Bitcoin can fully protect itself -- by making it too costly to back an alt in this way.
I hope your confidence in the irrelevance of hashrate is not tested.  But when it is, the first petahash to defect is choosing between a 100% chance at $5000 * 50, and a .0025% chance at $1550 * 12.5.
 
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:21:34
Not many people at first.  After it has all the hash power, more and more people.
Bitcoin had a built-in incentive to avoid this -- fast growth to critical mass.
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:15:52
This answer is flat out disingenuous.
LN aims to replace direct use of the blockchain for the transactions that it handles.  One of the many tradeoffs is that the universe of transaction types is severely restricted.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:44:27
Ok I'll spell it out for you (and them, sadly)
Clone. Premine 15%.  Get listed on exchanges. Then back the coin by placing a permanent bid at say, $5000 per token.  
Now, are miners going to mine BTC, or this thing?
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:47:53
Nothing you said makes bitcoin resistant to the attack I described.  A clone runs the same code, remember?
The only things that make bitcoin special are the hashrate (which you dismiss as unimportant) and real-world acceptance (which you understand, but don't recognize is dwindling).
Things have become very dangerous for bitcoin, and it's on the wrong path.  People like you will get hurt the most, assuming you're not a blockstreamer.
