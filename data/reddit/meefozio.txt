I'm not sure that one can gauge what a "fair market value" actually is for a cryptocurrency.  I'd say that because we're still in the early stages of the game, there's a much more potential for adoption and subsequent price increase.
'Long' verification time is immaterial as 0-confirmation transactions are what retailers use at checkout.  I've purchased a lot using bitcoin and it's never taken more than a minute at the register.
I do not doubt that dogecoin growth will outpace bitcoin in the short term because it's like a penny stock and is considered cheap.  Like I said, I know there are bitcoiners who are becoming dogecoin whales and when they are satisfied with their gains, the first major selloff is going to be interesting.  What follows that is less likely to be a lasting rebound.

I do not understand this.  The mutant transaction doesn't actually alter the address to which the change gets sent, does it?  I assume not.  So, doesn't that mean that your change address still has the balance that the original transaction assumed?  Why would future transactions coming out of the change address be invalid?

Everyone says dogecoin is about fun and community or whatever, but I do not buy it for a second.  I believe the users are focused on little else but the potential to get rich quick.  Whatever charitable actions are taken are in the interest of replicating bitcoin's price history.  Bitcoin paved the way and overcame all the biggest hurdles and now the risk of throwing your money behind a nearly copied protocol is much, much smaller.  Combine the 100 billion coin limit with dogecoin's "unsavvy" user base, and this thing will continue to climb in price for no actual reason other than greed.
I don't think it'll work out for them as they hope though - there are too many richer bitcoiners who have purchased a lion's share of dogecoin and they will cash out _first_ before  it's worth the little guys' while.  When the whales begin to cash out, it will be hard for the price to rebound because they will have to rationalize their existence next to bitcoin which leads crypto, has more infrastructure, more retailers, more tools, better security, and commands the attention of governments and giants of finance because it's not perceived as a temporary joke for kids.  I don't mean that as a jab to dogecoin, but that is really how it's perceived.

By this logic, the price can go to 1 cent and bitcoin will still be "pretty valuable" in your opinion.

I guess I'm not convinced.  Gox has been surviving uncertain legal issues for nearly a year now without much of a problem.  Capital won't become a significant problem because the cost of running a web server without any sort of support is very small. Combine this with the fact that your customers will keep coming despite being unable to pay them in cash the and there's no reason they should go under. The technical issues they're having at the moment will likely pass.

Unless you're already rich, there is no way you can risk having your $500 investment on an experimental currency that's now worth $250,000 potentially crash to zero. The risk is too great when you consider how a quarter million principle can be grown over your lifetime via traditional investments.

Exactly. Buying gold with Bitcoin is an exercise in futility. You buy Bitcoin, the payment processor sells the Bitcoin, then they give the proceeds to the gold dealer. If you cut out the middle man, then it's just you buying Bitcoin, selling the Bitcoin, then using cash to buy gold. Why even buy it in the first place?
This simply amounts to speculation on Bitcoin in the hopes that you gain purchasing power after exchange fees. The process doesn't make Bitcoin any more acceptable to the public, it just helps to liquidate it.

Pay off student loans?  Hmm.  I've got 22k in student loans and I'm in no rush to pay it.  The interest is tax deductible and I am anticipating very high inflation in the near future.

At that point, the dollar should plunge and I'll be able to pay off my loans for less real wealth.

Exactly what's wrong with deflation?  Every time someone mentions this idea, I have yet to see them put a logical argument together which supports it.  Instead, they are left pointing to historical episodes on which the facts of the matter are often controversial if not flatly wrong.  You shouldn't have to point to the past to make a logical point -- if you find yourself doing this, it probably means that you don't actually understand the concept.

How we speak about bitcoins doesn't matter.  The price will go to an insanely high dollar value per bitcoin as long as they are actually used in a way that produces greater value.

Is it really a long term store of wealth though?  If the utility of bitcoin fails to be realized, the price will be negatively affected.  I mean, when a newbie comes to these forums and asks _"Is it a good time to invest?  How much should I buy?"_ one of the top answers will always say not to invest more than you're willing to lose.  It's too early and too speculative to currently call it an intelligent way to store your wealth.  We are all taking significant risk when we throw our money into this.
