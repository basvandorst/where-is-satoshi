Good question! Seems like it should be on their site here:  But that BRTI (realtime index) listed there has not been updated since yesterday morning. Anyone know if this is the right spot for BRTI or is that available somewhere else?

Curious to know about anyone's experiences depositing BCH to an exchange and trading for other crypto. How long did it take for your deposit to be processed and how long did it take for you to trade on the exchange? I deposited BCH to Bittrex, which requires 20 confirmations. I'm seeing confirmation rate of less than one per hour, which may be more a limitation of BCH than of Bittrex. 
I’d be interested to know if any other exchanges somehow allow quicker deposit and trade transactions.

5505 here. Still stinging, but happy to see today's price!

I've seen several replies recommending to get a SegWit enabled wallet, but haven't seen one identified. Can you recommend the best SegWit enabled wallet for Android? Thanks!

Sad to hear. As an Android user I love Mycelium and have also been recommending it to my iOS friends. What's the next best iOS wallet I can recommend?

The video title is misleading since it references "2019" but it was published on June 6, 2018. :)

Pretty comprehensive response that shows they clearly did conduct an exhaustive analysis. Many legitimate points highlighting serious risk factors. This 14-hour posting seems to have been met with crickets on r/bitcoin. Has anyone seen any serious responses from the Bitcoin defenders???

Hmm... the researcher who did the analysis is "Skye Grey" but I don't see any related discussions in Where was this discussed? Would love to see all the speculation. :)

Was your account linked to Coinbase or were you sending / wiring money to any of the other exchanges? Did you have a high volume of transactions? Now I'm afraid my Chase account is at risk as it's linked to Coinbase...

OK, did a search for "szabo" and found it! 
 Duh!

I totally did exactly the same as you (bought @ 1k and then again right after the crash started). Wife didn't approve additional purchase @ 650 though. Still holding all coins and long on BTC!
