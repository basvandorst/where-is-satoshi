One thing that concerned me was in the [hacker news discussion]( They mentioned that given the P2P nature of bitcoin, someone with malicious intent could find a list of IP addresses. Although they are not linked to a bitcoin address, it's still a concern in that digital pickpockets could start serially stealing coins from everyone. What is the likelyhood of this, how would one secure themselves against this type of criminal?
