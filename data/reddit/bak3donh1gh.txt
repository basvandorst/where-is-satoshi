No idea. Must have been in the month as this did not happen the last time I used BTC in Oct.

No normally i double check the address but it was late and I didn't notice. I just double CTRL  C +  V instead of actually looking.
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:17:00
no it did catch it. I just didnt have it running/updated until after this happened.
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:13:42
yeah it did.  Im glad it was only 60$ CAD
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:07:21

The system I use isn't the most identify hidden technique, but i basically have a account on cavirtex thats been confirmed and i direct deposit from my bank account. From there is goes to a wallet, after each transaction i get a new address, and from there is goes to the site of my choice.

So thats why I got a response on a 4 year old comment.

Naw Canada here kind of get screwed for everything here despite being so close.
I'm not so sure I'd want people coming to my place to exchange cash for btc. I live in a middle sized city so there might be a couple of people, as well I doubt the landlords would like people coming regularly. As well it would look suspicious and make my place a target for robbery.

My problem with it is the delay/cost of turning you're local currency into BTC and back. Its minimum one day delay 3% off the top and if I want to deposit cash back to my bank its 6$ dollars.

I agree thats fantastic, but BTC still isn't really practical for most things. 
I don't hold onto any BC currently since I'm low income and cant afford to invest a solid amount on money in it(though after this bubble pops maybe ill start throwing 20$ a paycheck at it) and have it half all disappear all of a sudden, as well it was stable for awhile it hardly seemed worthwhile to have my funds unavailable.

I can see it hitting 200 eventually but moving from 30 dollars to 180 in three weeks is comical. It went up 15$ in a day yesterday. You think that many more people are using it?

It may not be the best but when where talking crypto currency saying I could write it down on a sheet of paper seems silly. While you can't realistically make a webpage of any currency where it is accepted.

True but if i listed what or where i could buy services goods with the balgladesh Taka id being scrolling for awhile. I'm sure the site that im referring to is not everything, but i can still scroll to the bottom quite quickly.

[heres one]( you'll have to find the other one yourself.

I would have said the same thing a week ago and been wrong but buying bitcoin now as a investment doesn't seem like a good idea. My understanding is the current bubble right now is being caused by the world economy state and what govts is doing in places like cypress right now and the attention bitcoin is gaining.
The value of a bitcoin currently is so high because so many people are trying to use it to make easy money. You can list the places that accept bitcoin as payment on a single webpage. I can't see a bitcoin valuing 200+ considering the services you are able to buy with it. But I'm not an economist so please correct me if im wrong.

If this bubble goes any higher ima be annoyed that I only got 185 for a bitcoin i randomly got, but yeah this bubble can't go on much longer. If you have enough coins at this point to pay off a loan it probably a smart idea to pay that off. 
Edit: You can buy honey with bitcoin but you can't live on honey.
