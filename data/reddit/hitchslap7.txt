They might. Overstock implemented it way ahead of schedule because it was easier than they anticipated, IIRC.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:20:56
God damn, it just dropped below 200 and now it's in free fall.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:33:17
50K --&gt; 200k --&gt; 400
Damn, they got robbed blind.
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:12:25
Is there any way to tap into this if I already have an account?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:07:15
Somebody get a fire extinguisher.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:20:01
EVERYONE wants their money out of Gox. But they can't withdraw USD, so they have to convert their USD to BTC to withdraw anything. If they fix BTC withdrawals, there could be a buying frenzy as everyone tries to get their money out at once.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:25:17
If they're fraudsters, they're doing a pretty competent job so far.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:28:53
Bears are waking up from hibernation.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:45:33
This is actually very good news.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:48:32
I wasn't quite sure what she was talking about until I saw the text and her little choke. That was hilarious.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:25:56
Get in here.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:59:05
There has to be somebody there on weekends.. right?
@_date: 2014-04-25 04:04:40
At this point, I almost wish we could. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:24:05
If he's barred by the government, the timing kind of makes sense. This all started right after the CEO of Bitinstant was arrested. Gox's wallets could have been seized for the investigation.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:24:55
Yeah, it's pronounced "Mount Gox." EM-TEE Gox just sounds weird.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:48:16
Great. That's exactly what we need right now.
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:28:29
LTC ON COINBASE!
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:54:33
Unfortunately, it only accepts BTC for two certificate programs. You can't pay your whole tuition in BTC, but that's to be expected. It's still awesome that the university is cautiously exploring crypto-currency as a payment option.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:40:25
Gox = Fontas. It explains everything.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:59:22
Hard drive prices drop every year. It won't be a problem as long as they keep getting cheaper.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:03:23
Hell yeah! You're gonna have a busy week. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:30:38
There's no way they relocated because of two guys sitting out front. They're lying about something.
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:18:46
We are the 68%!
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:25:51
That's probably the most brutal interview I've ever seen.
@_date: 2014-05-29 11:37:28
AT&amp;T is merging with DirecTV, not DISH. But yes, DISH is fucking huge.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:33:59
As long as they get to the bottom of this, I don't care if it takes an extra month or two.
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:54:23
It was probably mining Litecoins. ASICs for scrypt coins haven't shipped yet, so mining with a botnet can still be extremely profitable.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:11:36
I would have just assumed you were being sarcastic if it weren't for the edit.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:26:36


That's the situation we're already in. Hence the subpoena.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:17:35
We have to laugh at ourselves sometimes.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:20:47
Too soon.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:16:32
That's a pretty low bar.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:08:21
And this expired mayonnaise coupon.
@_date: 2014-05-29 11:30:48
This is huge! Not sure why the price is still falling, but I'm happy anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:00:50
Integration with Windows would probably make Bitcoin way more accessible to the average person, which is something we really need for widespread adoption. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:06:00
It's super effective!
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:29:32
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:42:07
Have they announced anything?
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:44:07
Only cash withdrawals are limited. They can still wire as much money as they like to Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:50:03
I opened an account on Gox a long time ago, but never bothered to get verified when they started requiring it. Am I ok? I don't remember how much information I gave them.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:27:11
Send him Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:52:59
Starbucks stock going to the moon any day now.
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:40:04
So they're still stalling on withdrawals. This sounds a lot like what they said a week ago.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:26:43


@_date: 2014-02-08 03:42:42
That would be awesome! Can you imagine never having to wait in a checkout line again?
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:39:37
This is awesome! I wish the IRS would get its act together and publish something like this. They've been silent for too long.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:47:36
Probably not for much longer.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:04:59
6 months after the Silk Road goes down, we have legal marijuana vending machines that accept BTC. How awesome it that?!
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:52:16
They've explicitly said that about Litecoin support too.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:22:12
**SHUNNING INTENSIFIES**
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:18:53
This is obvious.
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:18:47
Sub-400 prices last week weren't good enough for you?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:49:47
And now we get to wait for another non-announcement on Thursday.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:36:26
is leaking
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:38:29
Yeah, it's entirely possible that they asked him to leave. I'm sure they're pissed at him already, and we've been petitioning them to get rid of him for weeks.
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:54:46
Right. China has never heard of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:59:04
You're Goxdamn right.
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:19:00
It went back to normal for me when I refreshed the page.

He committed suicide yesterday.

Their sketches are always brilliant.
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:51:24
That's like giving Microsoft points to Bill Gates.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:33:40
Stewart and Cramer.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:19:32
Agreed, as long as they don't steal everyone's money.
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:35:38
I'm having fun just trying to imagine what Dogetopia is like. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:58:42
I'm just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's ok.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:06:32
Can it be a dessert-like coffee?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:48:02
I don't think they understand what that word means.
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:09:58
Can confirm. Drunkcoin is going to the moon.
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:15:50
aladeen! :)
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:17:27
Save it. This is the same fucker who tried to ban Bitcoin back in 2011. He really has it out for us. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:25:07


To be fair, it looks like they're trying to bring it back asap. They were just dealing with more volume than they could handle at the time.
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:31:23
Bitcoin is already exchangeable for stock. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 10:12:19
Is this why everyone's dumping right now?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:51:10
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:31:38
It's (potentially) great that she wants to introduce a bit of regulatory clarity, but asking any crypto project to halt all development until that happens is crazy.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:41:39


He sounds a bit panicked.
@_date: 2017-04-12 06:40:05
One way or another, we'll have him breaking his furniture before long.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:16:15
Sell at the top?
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:57:19
It's super effective!
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:20:57
And peg it at 1 CNY.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:19:35
I've heard Jesus is bullish on Bitcoin.

No, OP is a loud and obnoxious person who owns or frequently rides a Harley.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:21:51


@_date: 2013-12-05 09:14:49
This is why BTC will never replace fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:19:51
Looks like it was another flash-crash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:25:57
I really hope you're right. My first thought was that he's gonna wake up tomorrow with a terrible hangover wondering where all his coins went.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:00:05
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:07:41
Yeah, but Bill Gates didn't have as much money as this guy.
