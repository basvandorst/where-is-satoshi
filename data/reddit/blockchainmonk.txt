The problem with Chinese government is Capital flight not about adapting innovation. China is very strict regarding capital control. If a country can ban Facebook , Google etc so it can also impose some restrictions on Bitcoin. Let see what will happen in 2017. I hope it will also be a good year like 2016 .
