If LN is achieved, the Bitcoin price will jump up significantly. Think about BCash: the only reason it has value is because it has lower TX fees. It has lower TX fees because the block size is greater, allowing for more TX per block and hence more TX per second. 
With LN, the current limitations would fall away almost completely (at least for a while, there are other scalability issues arising, but those are a bit away), hence BTC would lose its only real downside (i.e. the only "right of existence for BCash) and become usable for both store of value and as a currency.
From a miner's perspective, the following analogy woukd hold up: they would get a a smaller share of the pie, but the pie would massively expand, leaving everybody better off.

Where did I insult? I stated that he uses fillers and stutters. Those are facts. If I wanted to offend or insult him, don't you think I could have said something like:
"OMG, you are so retarded", "Didn't your mom teach you how to talk", or "Wow, what a dumbass, cannot make any point".
Those I did not use. I stated my opinion that he stretched a lot oft nothing over 5 minutes, part of that length being due to his speech patterns.

@_date: 2018-02-20 10:45:36
Sorry, but this shows a complete lack of understanding of use cases oft cryptos. 
"There is just one Internet" is lije saying only BMW makes real BMWs. It's a nonesense, cyclical argument.
There are private networks, that don't have any communication with the outside word. Computers, linked together, that are not the internet.
And just like there are multiple (in fact countless) LANs, there will be countless cryptos for every different use case. 
How will you execute smart contracts? You need something like NEO or Ethereum. How will you have fully confidential transactions? You need Dash and Monero. 
Just like you don't wear the same pair oft shoes to all occasions, there is a need for more than one crypto.
The only one to determine which ones survive is the free market.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:41:27
Apples and oranges, bro. It is fundamentally different to make a short term prediction vs. recognizing long term trends (you would know that if you had ever read a book. J.k., that is something you'd say, I guess). 
I was sure Bitcoin would increase in value when I first bought in 2012. Do I know the value oft BTC tomorrow? No, but I am certain that within the next year vor two it will be worth significantly more that today. 
See the difference?
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:47:33
First off, I think we do not know for certain if one person really does hold that much mining power (though I am willing to be convinced otherwise).
If it turns out that one person / entity controls a huge share that can be grabbed by another party - a share large enough to cause significsnt damage - then we will be taught the painful lesson that SHA-256 was a poor algorithm or maybe even that soley relying on POW is a bad idea, because it allowed for too much centralization and hence a lack of - as you called it - "a large number of independent miners".
What is not clear to me though, is the reasoning somebody would attempt to "break Bitcoin". The Bitmain people make billions a year in profit, both form mining and the device sale. Even giving the impression of them holding a too-big share could threaten the trust in Bitcoin and hence affect the price negatively, the price that they - as miners - depend on. Once we start seeing selfish-mining on the network occurr regularly, it will cause a panic wave throughout Bitcoin, again potentially crashing the price.
If we assume that the government of China was set out to destroy Bitcoin, my questions would be why? What interest does China have in breaking Bitcoin (and in the process possibly all POW-based coins due to the panic attacks waving thoughout the markets, if not all cryptos regardless of consensus mechanism)? Yeah, China doesn't like Bitcoin because they claim it can be used in fraud and corruption. The real reason may be rather that people can get around repressive government controls. But there seem to be easier ways of getting Bitcoin out, namely what happened.
China banned exchanges and now mining. With them overseeing the transactions conducted through banks, they have all necessary tools to avoid people buying Bitcoin.
China has a self-interest in Bitcoin/Crypto being successful. Like any country, China collects taxes. And Bitmain pays taxes. The companies making (parts for) GPUs pay taxes. Other ASIC-producers located in China pay taxes. 
I don't see why China would be acting in its self-interest by killing Bitcoin, thus lowering their own tax revenue, if they have (and are using) the necessary tools to get what they want another way.

If you are so sure, give me a time estimate by which time there will be only Bitcoin left and let's set a reminder bot.
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:48:27
Exactly this. Everybody needs to be "allowed" to be "evil" (working only for their own self interest). The fundamental core of Bitcoin is LACK of trust, meaning Bitcoin cannot be dependent upon TRUSTING that anybody will act against their own self interest. 
It's nice if they do (like miners switching pools when their pool get a too high hash rate), but if we cannot depend on / TRUST IN it.

Your argument is essentially "all the computer producers will go bankrupt, because we only need Apple MacBooks". It ignores the basic economic reality that in a free market, such as the crypto space, there are virtually no monopolies, because smaller projects/companies/groups tend to have a higher ability for speedy innovation and the ability to appeal to nieche needs.

Here is the situation as I see it: you believe that Bitcoin, through multi-layer tech will achieve a universal useage making altcoins obsolete. Fair enough, its a hypothesis.
So you must believe that there is a point in time at which Bitcoin will have a drastic market cap share (let's say 90%) (again). All I am asking, and what for some reason you are only ever answer with essentially "read a book", is when does this take place. 2019? 2025? 2050? 
Why does it seem so hard for you to give me a simple answer regarding something you seem so sure and claim to be so educated about?
