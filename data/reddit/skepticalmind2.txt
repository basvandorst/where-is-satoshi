They do.  It is.  The only difference between BCH and core is blocksize.  They can and will implement all the new features coming to core.

That's not true.  The Bitcoin Unlimited testnet is explicitly testing to see if complete onchain is a feasible solution or not.  If it turns out that sidechains or second layers are more efficient or necessary, they plan on doing that.  Which ever is better.

That brief I linked is linked directly from the BCH home page under the New Features section.  I'd say that's being on their road map.

Coinbase said the issue was “caused by the merchant partner improperly using the return values in our merchant integration API,”

Yeah but why is it the Foundation's fault for getting their own money back?  
Wouldn't you ask to get your money back?
Let's say you had money in Gox and they declare bankruptcy.  So you send Gox a letter asking them to send you your money back, as countless people have no doubt done.  Only in your case, they happen to actually send you the money!
Should you be thrown in a cage for that?
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:27:10
Yeah, I just don't see getting your own money out of your own account as being some kind of crime.  If that happened, I say good for him.
As for Matonis being in control of the Willy Bot, that just sounds absurd.  Could you imagine some old guy with no coding background and a clean record coming up with that bot all on his own?  And if not him, then why would the bot creator work with anyone at all?  Why not keep it all for yourself?
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:51:50
I agree that people would be enraged by such a discovery, I just think that rage is the product of greed and envy, not because of any real property crime by the folks at the Foundation - assuming that they weren't involved with the bot in anyway.
So far, the evidence seems to be rather thin on all fronts, and the guy making the accusations has seemingly disappeared.  For now, there's no need for anyone to get worked up about this.
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:37:51
I guess we shall see.  Setting the bot issue aside, why should you be mad that someone else was able to get their own money back?  Why be mad at the Foundation?  Shouldn't you be mad at Gox instead?  If this is actually true, what crime is the Foundation guilty of?
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:13:01
No proof, just accusations.  Further, if all the Foundation did was obtain access to their own account to get their own money out, I don't see how that could possibly be construed as fraud on the part of the Foundation.  If that happened, it might not be "fair" to the others who couldn't get their money, but it's not fraud.
The only way I could see any of this being an issue in regards to the Foundation is if the Foundation knowingly benefited from the supposed theft of coins that took place.  
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:41:11
Yeah that seems like a stretch.  Even if they used coins Gox gave them in violation of bankruptcy laws to further their donation agenda, that's not fraud unless they tell lies in the furtherance of that donation agenda.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:34:41
Yes, Gox could be held accountable for fraud and the Foundation could be sued for a share of the money they obtained by the people who didn't get their cut.
However, just looking at this from a pure property rights perspective, regardless of the law, how is the Foundation at fault for any kind of fraud or property crime?
The people suing would have a civil case against them, but I don't see any kind of property crime taking place.  Assuming the Foundation wasn't involved with the bot or lied about something in some way, all they are guilty of is getting their own money back, which doesn't constitute a crime in my book.

"Dumping" schemes in bitcoin are simply not possible.  In order for a pump and dump to work, stocks have to be issued by inside traders.  Stock creation and pricing is arbitrary.  Bitcoins cannot be arbitrarily created by any entity. In order for bitcoins to be "dumped," they first have to be acquired on the market.  It's not illegal or unethical to "dump" bitcoin holdings.  
Even if an investor is openly promoting bitcoin use, it's not unethical for him to be dumping bitcoins at the same time.  Bitcoins are trading tools, they are not stock equities.  They don't represent a stake in some company that has a profit motive.  Unless the foundation is claiming bitcoin can do things it can't really do in order to entice people into buying and holding bitcoins, there's no fraud involved. 
"Dumping" bitcoins is no different than a metals broker "dumping" gold holdings while promoting others to buy them.  In fact, that's entirely how a metals broker makes his living!

The guy who wrote it is a Keynesian.  Enough said.
Here's his bio:
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:46:49
Yeah, on the part of Gox.  But we aren't talking about Gox.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:44:22
I agree.  I don't understand why people think this is a good thing.  It's already impossible to make a profit anywhere that doesn't have nearly free electricity.

nice suit.
