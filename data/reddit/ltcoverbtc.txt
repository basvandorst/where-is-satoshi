Let the price rise in 3,2,1....

\&gt; Usually people give there 2 cents. I’m giving you my 12 cents. 
Even crappy browser auto-correct detects this one.

Even if it were to take this long (which I don't believe) it is worth the wait. Support is increasing gradually.

Thanks. It was just wondering because the LN whitepaper doesn't really touch any economic aspects. All references to incentives are about the mechanics and not why people will run the network.

Interesting presentation. I'd love to hear from the experts about the actual economic incentive model for running LN nodes. I assume LN nodes need to be attractive to be run. After all you put your coins out there, which isn't free. Assuming all technical details are ironed out, what makes the LN tick economically? Fees seem to be very low considering the opportunity and potential security risks. Let's say I am early adopter that has 3-4 BTC to my name, what are my expected returns as a percentage? Just trying to figure out the economics of it all.

It is pretty obvious that scaling needs to be layered. If onchain transactions get cheaper then there is less incentive to use LN and less incentive to develop for LN. Just look at the adoption and stats. More nodes are coming online all the time and non-custodial wallets are getting better and better.
Onchain improvements have been made and will be made in the future, but they can be safely done through soft forks. SegWit for example is already close to 50% use. Once fees go up, this will incentivize even more use and so on.
It is extremely unlikely that there will be a breakthrough big enough to allow world-scale onchain scaling. Both CPU power, storage and bandwidth advances are flattening. It is instrumental that we keep the network decentralized - if you don't get this, I can't help you.

And this is a good thing! BTC fees should be high so people use more efficient 2nd layer solutions. The limit and higher fees are the perfect way to encourage the use of things like LN etc. This will incentivize development of these technologies.

That sentence gives me a headache... not good if you want to have a career.

Is there any information out there as to when we can expect Schnorr signature support? It seems to be a no brainer.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:57:49
Anyone know when the next feature release will be and what we can expect from it?
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:52:45
huh? My [amazon.com]( account is older than 15 years. TCP was very simple to use even 20 years ago.

Impressive tweet!

I think networks stats speak for themselves. 2020 could be the year when LN really takes off: 
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:36:43
Not a dev... but what's the hold up with Schnorr signatures? It seems to be something that has been implemented elsewhere including in trashy bcash.
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:16:06
From what I understand it could easily be implemented with a soft fork. With LN taking off it should be no issue as there will be only occasional need for on chain transactions.
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:54:13
That's a very cool use case. How many blockchain transactions will that require? One to 'buy', one to 'sell', similar to a LN channel opening and closing?
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:01:03
So is it correct to assume that if LN works the way it should, many people will actually not hold Bitcoin in a Bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:49:06
Well, the Zuck did pay them, he didn't pay others though. Do you really think he just paid them because he wanted the lawsuit to go away? They had something to stand on.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:03:59
keeping the record straight.

Bitcoin will have enough scale with LN in the short term. I'd rather see an extremely conservative approach.
