Just ise the blockchain to reverse the transfers.  Amiright?  New client update may be needed.  Start a claim process during the transition period.

Does anyone else think that how public the transaction is helps with security?  Who thinks the personal security of anonymity is more important?  I always thought we should just unwind alot of Mt. Gox transaction and disavow the historical theft via reversing the theft but it seems too much time has passed now.

Lol, no kidding...  The guy is going to go into hiding probably Belarus and just pay some thugs to protect himself.  If the shakedown comes with more muscles then poof withdrawal accepted.

I guess you are right about reversing the transactions.  It isn't too late how would the bitcoin community comply with the court order?

What if overstock keeps the coins?
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:15:43
No, they keep the bitcoins and don't use this coinbase you are talking about.  What if?
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:15:59
By "sale of coin" do you mean sending currency for BTC?

It matters.  When you obtain through mining you are not using the regulated financial system.  You are exercising your right to free speech.  It is a computer algorithm that takes work to find the next block.   The fact that people pay money for the proof of work is where regulatory agencies may impose their will.  If you use their currency or especially exchange it to their currency then you need to pay income taxes if you are from usa.
