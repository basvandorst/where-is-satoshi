The passphrase it generates for you, do the words come from a publicly known static list? 
I think I have spelt a word wrong and would like to compare to the list of possible words to try and correct this error

Make sure you read up on how best to secure it! Better to learn from the start :D
This video shows how to use Armory client in offline mode, I found this pretty useful but maybe use it as a starting point for your reading if you haven't already -

Hopefully they will release stats after a week or something showing how much gets given, or at the end of the discount if this is limited time only.

Left them a short message, got this in reply. Emphasised an interesting part, though it was probably just worded a bit too positively to be fair

Hope the quality isn't too shit

Wow, when you make it rain, it pours I guess! Nice one mate

Hey thank you for the follow-up. Unfortunately both of the blockchain.info recovery portals you offered to me didn't recognise the 12 word passphrase either. One of the words which were not recognised was 'accession', but I still haven't found anywhere which accepts this word or my entire phrase.
I'm presuming its a lost cause at this point and nobody can save me from my stupidity :)

Thank you for responding. I've done some more research and it appears that Breadwallet also uses BIP39's wordlist to generate the seed mnemonic. I responded to above that the words I have do not all correspond with that wordlist. 
If you have any other suggestions it would be appreciated. One of the words in my list but not the mentioned wordlists is 'accession'.
@_date: 2016-11-06 19:57:25
Thank you for the response. I've tried within Electrum and it doesn't accept the words. Checking against the word-list shows that while some words are valid, many are not. ( It appears that the electrum list is the same as BIP39 (
It must have been generated using a different seed wordlist. If you know of any more wallets I can try that would be great. One of the words which is on my paper, but is not in the word list is 'accession'

That confused me for a while until I saw the bot's reply. Thanks for that mate, looks like I'll be spending later trying to 'get started' with BTC then!  I think I have a fair bit to learn :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:59:09
I didn't use Bitcoins to pay simply because I don't actually have any, I'm only interested in the technicalities behind BTC at this stage other than a poor attempt at mining over a year ago. I've not actually got properly involved yet.
The accepting of BTC was a driver policy, it isn't company wide or anything like that so quite the opposite of what you were getting at I think. Just an enthusiastic driver who mines himself and stickered up the car to advertise in the hope he'll pick someone up who is also a user. 
Hope that clarifies a bit 
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:22:09
Thanks buddy, will look at setting myself up on Bitcoin shortly. I'll pass the tip on if I get him as my driver again. He was a nice guy from Poland if that lines up any more with the person you've heard of :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:17:30
Theres no way of booking this individual driver unfortunately. You call up the cab company and the job gets automatically distributed to the driver in the area who has been waiting the longest. Its the individual driver offering the BTC service not the parent company so theres no benefit showing or even associating the company in this subreddit. They have 150+ cars in their fleet and many more drivers so unfortunately hes just a lone person in a very big organisation. Hope that clears it up :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:51:50
Reddit scares me sometimes... Yes. Yes it is. 
Edit: Unsure of the downvote reason. But to clarify the blurring was simply because its a driver initiated policy, nothing to do with the company itself deciding to roll out BTC acceptance to all cabs or anything, so the company info seemed unimportant. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:17:57
Just answered here mate - 
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:54:01
Yeah the guy said that card payments were coming soon, but that there were charges on every payment, and then more charges to receive your money from them unless your account has reached a certain threshold similar to how Adsense holds your money I think.
He'd much prefer Bitcoin before cards thats for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:57:58
Not a clue I'm sorry. It was only towards the end of the journey he asked me what I did, and I explained I'm a student of Forensic Computing and Security which sparked him asking me if I'd heard of Bitcoins so there wasn't much opportunity to ask that many questions
I don't know much about the possibilities for a mobile transaction, but I'd have thought he wouldn't have even pressed for a payment right there and then due to the rarity and in a way novelty of finding someone willing to pay via BTC. He knows where I live at the end of the day ;)
