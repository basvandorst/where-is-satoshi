While this may or may not be true in a closed system, the fact is that Bitcoin will likely never be the primary currency or store of value.  Fiat currencies will most likely hold the dominant position.  Taxes will always be due in fiat as will most debt.  The risk of such a deflationary spiral is actually very low.

With regards to the money laundering aspect, this can be done with cash already. Also, you could benefit from a little rudimentary search on US tax law so you don't appear so ignorant while trolling.  1099s are issued to subcontractors or others earning non-wage income.  They and their accompanying 1096 must be filed regardless of the method of payment.

I also see Litecoin as pointless.  What need is there for a copycat that brings nothing to the table that isn't already provided by Bitcoin.  It only appears to have support among a handful of people who are bitter because they were late to the BTC mining game.

No because as first mover with much better recognition and adoption combined with the fact that it does possess unique properties make it useful in real world applications, Bitcoin has a reasonably high likelihood of success.  None of these clones have anything that distinguishes itself well enough from Bitcoin to provide any real value.

I'm not arguing that. If somebody is foolish enough to buy them then by all means it's fine to make a profit.  Just get out quick because they are all essentially pump and dumps.

At this point none of them provide anything of value except to those who wish they had started mining Bitcoin while it was still reasonably easy and inexpensive to do so.  Since they are all essentially Bitcoin knockoffs that provide nothing that cannot be accomplished within the original protocol they will likely eventually whither and die once the people mining and trading them realize that unless they are able to solve some real world application Bitcoin doesn't, there will never be any interest from outside their circle.

Standard SI notation defines Mega as 1000000 wheras micro is 1/1000000.  It doesn't matter where you put the decimal point because it was wrong.

Actually this addresses one issue in that receipts from services like Satoshi Dice (or others) can be delivered without creating an additional transaction.  While this may not be the end all solution to eliminating bloat in the blockchain, incremental improvements when combined can make a significant difference over time

This is all fine and well until the company is shuttered on some  anti-counterfeiting statute.  It doesn't help when they claim, "They can be safely handled without danger of separation, and could easily circulate without detection."  However, this statement isn't even necessary.  Eventually, they will get a knock on the door from Treasury.

Noob question here.  I purchased a few ASICMINER-PT shares on btct.co last week however I do not see any dividends credited to my account.  Can somebody explain how and when are btct.co dividends distributed?

I sold a preorder BFL Miner to a Chinese buyer using bitcoin (at his suggestion) which made the transaction much smoother considering all the wildcards involved.  Please note however that the auction was pulled three times.  The first because I wasn't verified (fair enough), the second because I mentioned accepting bitcoin as a condition for turning over BFL account access in addition to the miner itself.  They informed me bitcoin was not a valid payment option.  I actually stated this when re-listing.  The third was that a potential 2+ month ship time violated their buyer protection terms as does bitcoin itself.  
In short, there are advantages but be prepared to deal with the eBay police.  You will after all be violating their terms.

You are thinking of a microbitcoin. If it were a megabitcoin, even Satoshi likely couldn't afford it.

I think services like PayPal, eBay, or Amazon would be better served embracing Bitcoin rather than fighting it.  By simply allowing all existing verified (FinCen) merchants the option to accept bitcoin and either hold it or immediately exchange to fiat, they would instantly expand their reach to emerging markets without the need to establish banking relationships or expose themselves or their merchants to the risks of fraud or chargebacks.  Transaction costs would be lower which would provide them profitability as well as a competitive edge in the market.  They could still offer buyer protection by holding funds in escrow either in fiat or bitcoin at the merchants option.  The buyer would necessarily have to be informed and agree to the escrow option prior to initiating the transaction.
Obviously all of this would put them in direct competition with BitPay but they have a built in advantage due to trust and market share.  Of course, they would still likely have to be somewhat competitive on rates or the much cheaper solution will eventually win out.  They would also need strong ties to a reliable exchange, however, if the company handles enough volume, they could possibly even build or act as their own exchange.
For a companies like Western Union and MoneyGram on the other hand, their best bet is probably in the buying and selling of bitcoin for cash with a valid ID (FinCen) and payment processing in a manner similar to BitPay.  There is no way they can compete with Bitcoin itself in terms of ease of use and cost at least when it comes to transferring money between trusted parties either internationally or domestically.  Still though, they could hope to get the exchange fee on both ends.  The alternative is to get beat out by the bitcoin ATM coming soon to the liquor store across the street, although FinCen guidelines will still require some sort of ID verification for this.  However, that could easily be accomplished by creating accounts and issuing something similar to a debit card.

Coinbase.  Just attach a bank account and trade at market rates.

And none of them are of any use to anybody except those who missed the boat on Bitcoin mining and a few small time speculators.  Anybody actually buying them is a fool because nobody outside this tiny niche market wants them.  They will all eventually be worthless.
For an alternate cryptocoin  to be of any value it would have to solve a real world problem Bitcoin doesn't and since all other coins now are essentially Bitcoin clones none of them fit the bill.  Faster confirmations are meaningless especially since the cost is less confidence per confirmation meaning more are needed.  Primecoin doesn't count because while solving for prime numbers is a worthy goal, this adds nothing to it's value as currency.  Namecoin also and for a similar reason.

Micro is 1/1000000.  Mega is 1"1000000.  As I said, this is standard notation.

You can use whatever you like.  Personally, I've decided I'm going to use kilobitcoin (KBtC) so everything will seem really inexpensive.
