@_date: 2015-12-09 00:20:02
I just want to see what Andreas says about all this...  to laugh a little before going to sleep.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:42:31

@_date: 2015-06-07 04:32:03
A vegan diet, it's not a technology but it will do the same to the health industry, it's really amazing, and it's just in the first phase of rejection/I don't remember the other ones but you get the hang of it.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:18:25
just pure luck, SN is very familiar with japanese culture, he would be MORE HUMBLE...
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:09:27
JUST GO VEGAN CAUSE IS A HOAX!
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:13:57
this fomo is over and is going to crash cause he is not the real SN  ;)
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:00:45

@_date: 2015-12-09 01:31:56
I think they went down quite a bit.
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:51:52
well the bitcoin blockchain is the first ledger that can't be change, the organ donor list is not that transparent, it should be one of the first thing, because is the most secure ledger on the earth.
@_date: 2015-06-22 00:05:01
So what basically with the blockchain, you rent your bike and if they broke it waht?
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:48:25
time will tale... 
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:58:40
then i said to him, do not fear my friend just go vegan 
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:55:41
SN will not come out for this, we all already know he is not "SN"
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:20:30
what i think we are is mind, and the mind is NOT the brain, just like the radio is not the the person speaking, and that is  what reincarnates, karma and reencarnation, it's much more logical in that way than luck.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:37:48
yes SN.
@_date: 2016-03-03 05:29:56
expensive errors, we all been there...
@_date: 2016-01-24 08:03:56
because is has a competition.  let the best code win ;)
@_date: 2016-03-15 04:59:56
Just like bombs in gaza right?, just... everywhere ;)
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:38:17

@_date: 2016-06-18 22:14:11
I have a smarthphone but doesn't receive sms or calls it has no sim card. They had an incident that made Coinbase double charge a lot of orders. I am still waiting for this shit. And thanks to that I could not benefit the Margin trading in bitfinex and made a couple of 100 bucks. There support is the worst of any exchange. An exchange! where everything suppose to be smooth like a baby's ass.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:21:09

@_date: 2016-11-09 08:35:52

@_date: 2016-12-18 16:41:50

@_date: 2016-11-19 18:05:29
Remind me!  3 months. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:48:32
research my friend puerto rico is very nice...
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:07:52
Again Wrong! If you lived the majority of the year on Puerto Rico you don't pay personal federal income tax. CHECK 1ST! Of course I am referring to personal income tax.  " Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, Puerto Ricans are also required to pay most US federal taxes, with the major exception being that most residents do not have to pay the federal personal income tax. In 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the US Treasury."
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:04:49

Just some thought here: Lets say they are the same, Now we know Jim McCoy is the owner of the private keys of over 1million bitcoins, so not just people would want to find him, but governments would to.
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:05:02

@_date: 2015-08-12 17:42:21
Right just f now just try to verify my identity, and they respond this
 Henry: Sorry for the trouble. In the future we may be able to implement a different method for verifying identity, but at this time this is the only verification method we have available. Please make sure that all of your information is as it would appear on a legal document (i.e. your legal name, not a nickname, etc.). If this still doesn't work, unfortunately we may not be able to verify you at this time. We hope to add some more verification options in the future. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 15:58:56
WHY MONEY ORDER?

If you only had Google authenticator you can't install authy, so don't tell me to this or that with authy. You had to have authy before losing the phone, or in my case factory resetting the phone.
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:23:40
 He got control of the email after sometime trying, I think i had 2factor but don't know for sure.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:06:05
Really no one should use this site to trade anything! no one knows who is behind the site or where they are! no one accountable.
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:45:18
well they said there are new phishing attacks.
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:58:45
And i even told him trough email, that i work at the minimum and that was all the money i have and he or she did not send and email back, heartless piss of shit. And apparently the hacker have a lot of money!
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:23:45
He asked them but instead of checking the ip adress and have a feature that if you want to disable 2factor you have to have 2factor key they just disable it!
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:39:47
all that because someone ask to remove 2 factor authentication, i said to them just don't remove it and that's  it right...

5 NODES IN EVERY COUNTRY?
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:13:36
what are you talking about? Bitcoin is software. If it says it takes 10 min to verified a transaction and it takes 20-30 or ... Then something is wrong with it. is about time that 2Mb blocks get implemented. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 23:58:41
well the good thing here is that scammeers from U.S. or other parts won't scam people from here P.R. to send things through paypal and then say they did not receive the thing.

I could have put 11btc on augur and only put .4btc LOL I lost the chance to fly around the world.
@_date: 2016-10-10 19:52:27
This is what Adam Ceo of Blockstream was talking about in this week on Scaling Bitcoin is Milan. Companies like this fucking the fungibility of Bitcoin. Shooting themselves and there customers on the foot and walking 50miles to the hospital killing everyone very slowly. Most likely you didn't do anything wrong but 4 hops away someone use those bitcoins to do something nefarious and Coinbase uses a service to track if the bitcoins that enter there system even 4 hops away where use for nefarious purposes, which is basically everyone in the community. That is why monero has value and zcoin and zcash are going to have value. Because people wan't and need privacy. And yes the dark markets are going to use them 1st because they need it for survival. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:28:52

@_date: 2015-11-28 05:21:45
