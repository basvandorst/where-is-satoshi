What are you talking about? Since when UK government was able to issue a gag order? And about what? About a list that shows what pseudonym/email owns what? IT IS NOT AN ASSET, it is a list of information. In what world information of shareholders (even a real companies) can be declared a secret? IT CAN'T. You can copy it, release it, even make a song about it. 
They can ask him to hold their Bitcoins, yes, but he can still talk how much he has them. He can release that information (of assets) if he want's to.
And btw, this shit is completely his fault. If you can't take the heat, cover your tracks or at least don't go publicly brag about it.

I wouldn't pay a dime to these morons who invested in it. They are as much as guilty as this pirate. Their punishment should be loss of that capital. Dump assholes... then they have audacity to whine over it. All of them knew exactly what they were doing, but they were blinded by greed. 
But, pirate also needs an punishment for operating this. This matter should go to police. And by the way, he operated in MtGox and there are pretty good security measures, he will be identified and funds frozen if MtGox is notified (by police). 
Of course if he used fake ID, and so forth (in MtGox), it will become harder, but somehow he still has to cash in. Probably he made those 100K dumps, so there is a trace. At least a place to start.

They are tax evading _through offshore banking_ /low tax branches because it is legal, not because of currency they use. 
In order to stop tax evasion almost completely, is to use a BTC/or an alternative transparent payment system, and change laws in that way that taxes are paid from income alone (like VAT for example), not profits, and to that country/state where the income is made.
@_date: 2012-11-10 11:08:35


Government doesn't care rats ass, whether one uses gold/silver/fish/peanuts/bad jokes to do ones business. All it cares, how much income, and how large costs did you have, in dollars (or other means they see fit).  To see the status live from block chain, eases their work quite a bit. Now when they suspect you of wrong doing, they'll have to do it by hand, with your awful bookkeeping. With BTC they could analyze your business live. 


As I have now 2 times already said, it will not cap the holes in the law, but it would be more than useful in order to detect tax evasion.
yea. The thing is that every other BTC promoter (which I'm happy to be one of) thinks that BTC somehow magically would starve government out of business because lack of funds, and that is just silly. One still needs governments approval, licence and comply with regulations in order to operate publicly. Currency has nothing to do with it, it is only means to transfer wealth, they could tax your livestock if they wanted. 
Only thing BTC will do is to enable system-D/black markets to flourish, and that will reduce government size sure, but it will not kill it. Not by far, even if it would be the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2012-11-10 08:57:35
Bitcoin doesn't enable tax evasion with licensed merchants. All government needs to do, is to make a law that requires all incoming and outgoing transactions to go through designated and announced BTC addresses. What we have there is a almost fully transparent double-entry book keeping.

And now when the game is on, cries like a baby and holds people assets as hostage. Hey Nefario, Fuck you. Give the issues those god damn lists, to let them move on. You're screwing all, fucking whiny bitch. It's not like its a state secret. Nobody can say anything if you give out information to issuers who owns what.
@_date: 2012-08-25 11:05:29
I agree that may piss people of, but lets face it: Would it be better that they would not screen those ips? That if someone have gotten them selves hacked, and then attacker would empty victims account (using some other compromised computer)? 
Using Yubi-key probably would stop that attack vector, but I for one am happy that they actually do screen those IPs. There is lot of money in there, and security is a good thing. 
As far as I know, those funds will be released after checks have been made. They do not do that to piss people off, they do it to secure all account holders. Sometimes those will raise false red flags, but that is better than not do it at all.

Yes, for a one dude selling stuff on eBay. But a real business, with real customers? Not so much. 
What you need is two sets of books in order to do that. One that sells these of the book merchandise to customers and uses that income to pay other "out of the book" purchases, or directly to owners. After that you still have to explain where did you get those funds to buy stuff, and where are the lost articles (that you sold).  Do that with 10-1000's of employees, you have a quite nice drama coming for you. Who is going to implement that? You need admins, devs to do that for you, and keep their mouth shut. And then you need to explain the seller why he/she can't have their commission from these "of the book" sells, or bribe them.
What ever that case may be, you would be demolished if IRS found that out. And I'm speaking jail time here. Do you really think that any business man is willing to take that risk, that whole company would be in jail, when you can just bump the cash to offshore account and be scott free.

There is. The hashing algorithm Litecoin uses is scrypt that needs more memory / bandwidth, what that results into is that there is not a significant advantage using ASICs. And that makes Litecoin is more "peoples coin" than Bitcoin. Why? If and when ASICs do arrive, GPUs will be changed to Litecoin network, thus increasing its security. Bitcoins Achilles heel are the development of ASICs and the resources needed to manufacture them. Unless ASICs are integrated to all ARM-chips or something like that, the consolidation of hash rate will be significant. (I do hope that multiple chip makers start to manufacture ASICs, and fast.)
If Litecoin-network gets all the GPUs that are hashing Bitcoin today, there wouldn't be any possible way anyone could get 51% attackpower, no matter the resources they hold. It is just too expensive (6x all the top500 supercomputers combined). Bitcoin does not. If mega players would now start making ASICs with full speed, for them (gov, banks) with their resources, we could be in serious trouble, if the other ASICs doesn't get out there fast enough, and distributed somewhat evenly. This is the last point of attack to the Bitcoin-network. If ASICs are distributed evenly enough (~ hundreds huge players), and there is enough of them out there, millions of chips range, then sky is the limit. But we are not there yet. 
Though a 51% attack could be dealt with cooperation of trusted nodes / community, so that could result in a billion dollar failure for the attacker, so the risk of trying that could be too much, and they just end up strengthening the network.

Well if BTC would become de facto world currency, then it very well could.
69,97 Trillion is World GDP * 30 working years = Total world wealth (from top of my hat)

I know that people think this differently as I but, how I see it, deflation is **shrinking monetary supply**. In fiat this mostly happens when debts are defaulted and paid. The debt and the money that was created for the debt vanishes. If everyone would pay their debts right now, this whole thing (our economy) would collapse. 
If someone loses BTC, yes it does shrink the BTC supply, but NO it does not mean deflation in any major sense (unless they actually lose a major percentage of all BTC and so forth)
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:01:00

Well, it is not ASIC proof. Nothing can be, that is the whole point of ASICs, but it is multiple times more expensive to make ASICs for scrypt, as it requires memory and so forth, and the cap between ASICs and GPUs isn't wide as with Bitcoin. And where do you think all those GPUs are gonna go when ASICs finally hit the Bitcoin markets by large? Are they going to sell them, or start making Litecoin network more resilient, thus increasing mining costs, thus increasing the price. Like it or not, but I think Litecoin is here to stay. It may never be as popular or widely accepted, but it will get its own space.  And some people prefer Pepsi and Linux Mint. Nothing wrong with that.

SD shows clipse of the future, as the scale of the tx we will eventually have to absorb and Litecoin, well I think BTC:LTC will eventually be close to 1:4 (21M:84M). Today it is something like, 1:1150. Because Litecoin has its own merits, it is not just copy&amp;paste of Bitcoin. It can manage transactions faster than Bitcoin ever will (4x), and it gives desktop users (and late comers) a possibility to mine. So there is a market for it, and if there is a market, there is a possibility to grow to its full potential.

My point is that, Bitcoin will eventually become a same kinda of decentralization as we have today with server farms (tens of thousands of big and small miner pools / centralized ops) .
