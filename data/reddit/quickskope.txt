Yea there's this really cool way to transfer money called cryptocurrencies.

This last year has been massive for Coinbase, so I wouldn't be surprised if they're now turning a profit. Or, more intelligently, investing that profit back into the company through different avenues (Toshi, GDAX).
I'm not gonna keep arguing that Coinbase is the next Google, because it's not. They're entirely different, but to compare it to a product like Snap which has no revenue stream is doing a disservice to a really great platform that trades slightly higher fees for a user experience that nobody has even come close to is worth it for a lot of users. It's not like users are day trading fiat/crypto on Coinbase, that's why they have GDAX, with 0 fees.
Plus, Brian seems to always be working towards diversifying Coinbase's interests. Stuff like Toshi, GDAX, etc just go to show that Coinbase could easily be murdered by a distributed exchange and still continue to provide a great service to the community.

No, I'm saying it's early enough in the game that the five year horizon could contain an IPO and anyone who has joined recently will be quite well off at that point.
Coinbase is printing money right now. By my calculations it's roughly 2.5% percent on every transaction.

Print a paper wallet and put it in safe somewhere. I've got one in my apartment, and I'll probably have to put one in my parents safe now that cryptos booking so hard.

One word: Ruby.
Yea, Snapchat was my example in terms of size. But Coinbase's monitization system is a percentage based one, like Uber or Square, but they're not subsidizing transactions. 
I just personally think they're in a really great place right now, have lots of engineering work to do, and will do great things in the next 2-5.

If someone finds out, you will be fired.

That's a good point. I don't think they're pulling an Uber and subsidizing new users, so I think their take is actually pretty good.
It's not the safest investment ever, but if crypto goes anywhere mainstream it's not inconceivable for it to hit a Snapchat level valuation, which leaves a couple of people I know with a 10m+ exit, even with a post IPO crash.
P.S it's not a server issue it's a literal scaling issue.

We lookin at the same pumps? The BCH pump is literally one of the only pumps that could have resulted in "insider trading" so far, and that's only up ~50-60% over the livetime of BCH.
Sure, you can plan to execute this kind of trade on every instantiation of the currency, but lots of these guys have stock deals which will stand to generate them a 5-10 million dollar exit over the four years. It doesn't make sense to do what you're saying, since it would take anywhere between 8 and 10 iterations of all ins at 100k w/ 60% growth to generate the same payout.
Crypto has a heavy element of game theory behind its design: It is only valuable if people perform honestly. If it ever got out that a bunch of Coinbase employees were performing insider trading, what do you think it would do for Bitcoins growth (And thus the funds that they cheat-traded to acquire?).
Plus the few Coinbase employees who I have met are seriously lovely dudes/dudettes. There will always be bad eggs in he batch, but I would bet heavy crypto on the fact that Coinbase is backed by some really talented, extremely nice, and ethically sound people.
Plus the valley talks. If you leave one of the hottest companies to be at right now and look for a new job, people are going to wonder why; and when you can't provide referrences because all your old coworkers/managers don't trust you anymore, good fucking luck getting another job in tech.
Just one guys opinion of them though. Take it for whatever you want.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:20:23
I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I'm just saying the stakes are high and the people who I know at Coinbase are already making money hand over fist (Since they've been at it a while), love their job, and simply wouldn't risk it for a couple extra hundred k.
Plus you stop vesting pre IPO shares the moment you get canned. And those shares are going to be worth a crapload sometime in the near future.
Also if you didn't have money in bcash you're doing it wrong because Coinbase has publicly stated that they're going to adopt it before 2018. It's not even insider trading at this point: they literally announced it on Twitter months ago.

It was my understanding the 8.5k price wasn't actually set, as the transactions weren't going through. If you check the actual Coinbase graph, you can see that it never went over 3.5k on Coinbase (Which uses the GDAX + Coinbase trades as datapoints).
I mean, I'll bite my tongue if something comes out, and I agree its was incredibly poorly handled. However, I'd rather just attribute it to poor management than malace.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:37:15
I mean, you'd have to be an absolute moron to trade on your Coinbase account at Coinbase, during working hours, and commit a firing level/legally actionable offense of insider trading.
Nobody would ever assume that the Coinbase price would be so out of whack, because that sort of arbitration discrepancy never happens. I'll give you that an employee may have had the potential to perform insider trading, but executing that trade on an 8.5k arbitrage error on your own platform, during working hours? No way.

Ha, burn SF to this ground and society will grind to a halt faster than you can say "World crisis". Fact is, that place rules the world.
Not my company, just know people there. Any guilty party will be flushed out I'm sure.

40K$ or 40K BTC? Big difference.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:34:22
Sublime, I like their style.
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:04:43
From what I've seen, they only have a wallet. Can you link me?

When I tried to register, It said I needed a Transaction PIN. Whats that?
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:52:44
Yes, first year software engineering :).

It's a shame, cause I was in Vancouver today :/
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:02:26
Doesn't that have like a 0.07 BTC max?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:23:53
Yup, exactly why I'm getting up early.

Having recently applied for scholarships, I was looking for something exactly like this. However, your terms are not specified here. I'm all for this idea, but you need some defined points for qualification.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:39:10
Ya, talk about steep, 10% markup?!? That's insane. I'm gonna go to my bank and setup a US account and do it the coinbase way, thanks though :).
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:14:42
Almost processed an order do 5000 when they were near 1$ back a couple years ago. Such regret ;_;

What's the exchange rate of Vaultofsatoshi? And the fee per transaction/site fee?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:12:11


What's your source on that? Seems a little ridiculous to me. I do believe however that bitcoins will hit 1000+ this evening or tomorrow morning, when news hits nation television. Amazing!
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:58:54
That's a net gain of about 50 million, which puts him in the top 1-5 wallets. Meaning he is worth more than a couple of the exchanges. Hard to believe.
