My concern is that LN will be less successful in gaining adoption than Segwit.

It will either eventually go through, or the txn will get dropped in about 2 weeks and it will be as if you never sent the satoshis

Can someone explain why futures that originate and settle in USD, force the price of Bitcoin up?

Since the CME future will originate and settle in cash (if I understand correctly), why would it be necessary to build up the buy side first?  You don't need to borrow anyone's coins to short you just need money to do it.
Also, aren't crypto markets already heavily leveraged?  Remember the ETH flash crash?

When the price starts to drop, panic sell all of it.
