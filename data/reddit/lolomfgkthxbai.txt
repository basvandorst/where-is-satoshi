Does anything similar for mainnet exist?

Nonsense. Buying and selling treasuries is a way of manipulating their currency. When they buy treasuries it's done by creating renminbi, buying dollars and using those to buy US government bonds; this increases the amount of currency in circulation which weakens it. When they sell US government bonds they get dollars in exchange which they use to buy renminbi, these then disappear from circulation thus strengthening their currency. This is done with all currencies, though the USD is the most important one since they trade a lot with the US.
If you look at a [historical chart]( you'll see that China has been amassing foreign exchange reserves at an increasing rate to try to keep the value of their currency down since the turn of the century but since 2015 they have been forced to sell off their reserves to strengthen their currency as their growth has slowed.

Easier said than done. I'm on testnet and have only been able to open one channel in the 20 or so nodes I've tried. Most likely the hubs forming in mainnet are the only ones able to be connected to.

Zero-coupon bonds do exist, but they are a poor choice for a hodler millionaire who wants to live on the interest payments.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:11:12
What argument? That taxes are the reason fiat currency has value is basic economics.
A lot of people tend to base some of their economic assumptions on "common sense" (which usually is wrong) instead of economic theory but this sub seems to not even try to understand the fiat system they are railing against. Most likely because anything that questions their "bitcoin to the moon! hodl hodl" narrative scares them. Personally I have a few bitcoins mined when GPU mining was just being introduced, I'm gonna hold them for now and see how high these tulips go in value. I do not for an instant believe that bitcoin will become *the* currency.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:38:43
Even if we ignore the apparent confusion between which inflation is meant, are you saying that the amount of bitcoin cash is increasing by 50% per month?
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:31:11


How do you figure that? If nominal values of stocks go down then that would imply that it's best to hold cash, not bitcoins.

It's pretty annoying that google directs to when looking for some bitcoin stuff. I was trying to figure out why my transactions are stuck and first thought that it was the "official" bitcoin subreddit, got a bit confused when it seemed like "the bitcoin subreddit" was a huge circlejerk shitting on the coin it supposedly was for. Not that this subreddit is any less of a circlejerk, but at least here I can get some helpful information in between all the shitposting.

Bonds exist for that reason, they even tend to become more valuable in market downturns as inflation expectations drop.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:25:07
You get 2.77% risk-free from 30 year US treasuries right now. Inflation might eat into your capital but you'd still get a decent living for a long time.
And to anyone considering replying with some tinfoil nonsense about US bankruptcy, don't waste your time.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:53:35
Well, in that case your comment makes slightly more sense even though the fluctuations in market value are irrelevant in our example. The market value approaches the face value of the bond as it reaches maturity. Eventually the bond is worth exactly the face value + the last interest payment as it is paid back at which point the investor has made 2.77% per year.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:36:10
Nonsense. [2.77%]( is the [yield to maturity.]( I realize most bitcoin hodlers are neophytes at investing so I'll forgive the confusion, bonds can get complicated.

@_date: 2017-08-25 10:30:50
The gist is this: gold will likely be valuable in the next civilization after societal collapse, even if shit gets primitive as hell and we start hitting each other with swords again. Bitcoin on the other hand will have zero value since a pre-requisite is a computerized civilization. You can argue that maybe the next civilization doesn't value gold or whatever, but if they don't have computers your bitcoins literally can't exist.
Is this useful? For some people. The internet is designed to survive a nuclear war which wipes out a large portion of humanity; bitcoin should be able to survive as well. Anything more and I'd probably rather just die personally.

Deposits are protected only up to a certain limit, that was known even before Cyprus yet the goldbug media made a big deal out of "CONFISCATION OMG" when deposits over the limit were lost. This is done to limit taxpayer liability because with no limit the banks need a lot of recapitalization which usually leads to the goldbug media crying about "BANK BAILOUTS OMG".
Greece on the other hand is actually a good example of how bitcoin can be useful for circumventing capital controls; of course, they wouldn't *need* to be circumvented if the eurozone was a functional currency issuing state...
Venezuela on the other hand is another clusterfuck entirely. Maybe bitcoin was used by some people to go around the official exchange rates before thing went to hell? Nowadays I doubt the locals really give a shit about bitcoin, they have other priorities (like hanging Maduro or at least getting some food on the table).
I guess I agree with you somewhat? In addition to circumventing capital controls bitcoin is useful for black market transactions, especially since there is a push for eliminating physical cash. It's not like I don't see some potential in bitcoin, I just get really annoyed at the bctards who rail against the modern fiat system. Without it the modern welfare state would not be possible and life for those outside the 1% would be very shitty. Of course, subscribers of this sub probably live under the delusion that they will be part of the future elite.

"Like" kinda implies that a number was pulled out from a hat.


Demand is the ultimate driver in our economy. It begets investment  into supplying what is demanded, this ultimately means jobs. A modern fiat economy is based on consumption; I don't think it's meaningful to talk about ancient eras or economies since we don't live in those eras and we have a better (as in one which maximizes happiness for most people) economic system. Even Islamic banking charges interest, they just call it something else and pay a scholar to sanction the loan.
