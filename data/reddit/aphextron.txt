In case this seemed like an isolated case, this is what I just got from another rep. This is priceless.

I was a pretty big fan of them until this.

Yeah tell me about it. I've been trying for the past 24 hours to get my account unblocked, because when she blocked it there was still coin in the account and she didn't even ask me what to do with it.

How exactly is pointing out a huge security hole in a popular site "public shaming"?
@_date: 2014-05-31 02:00:12
Never. I went to coin.mx and clicked on the live chat without logging into anything or giving any authorization at all.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:15:01
Nope. I use TOR for all of my bitcoin dealings.

Flame me for being rude all you want. If you had just given thousands of dollars to a company that treats account security like it's Neopets, you would have been a bit enraged as well.

A transcript of the conversation:


























































tldr: I entered the live chat at coin.mx, asked to have an account disabled with no authorization whatsoever, and it was granted. When I explained what she had just done, she called ME crazy.

Unfortunately from dealing with this company over the past 24 hours regarding this issue, I don't believe there are any "non-retarded" people involved. The incompetence has been systemic, and they've yet to even understand what the issue really is.

This just digs the hole even further. HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE? Do you even know what an HTTP header is? Or the fact that anyone can send any HTTP headers they want to your server? This is hilarious. Besides the fact that I already stated earlier I always use TOR when dealing with bitcoin, so she never even had my IP.

can someone explain this to me?
