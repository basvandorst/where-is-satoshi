Gotta question - has anyone asked the question of how this affect the money transmitter / money servicing businees laws? Does the current ruling squash this issue? This could actually be a good thing for Bitcoin.

I did. Paid for a Saturn and a Jupiter. 
Also I have the following preorders available:
All were reserved on June 3rd and are valid until Sunday the 8th june to be paid and transferred.
439 - 1x Jupiter
437 - 2x Saturn
433 - 1x Jupiter
432 - 2x Saturn
**431 - 1x Saturn - Might keep this one... still thinking about whether to pull the trigger on it...
Anyone interested in buying the slot send me a message before the end of the week so I can let them know to transfer them.

DO NOT USE BTC-E... They have no accountability, and will take your money. Already lost $200.00 almost 30 days ago, and if I'm lucky support sends me a 1-2 word response every two weeks AFTER I reopen the ticket. do yourself a favor, and use another exchange, but be careful... with decentralization come zero regulation and accountability. Trust is the only thing you have right now to rely upon.. It is best to make a few small transactions at first and confirm that the the exchange is legit. before moving large sums of BTC, or cash. Be careful...

Nobody is asking you to do anything you don't want to. You want to buy it. Good, you don't? Also good, but don't troll about someone offering something just because your not interested.

I think you guys got the information mixed up, the lottery is for the people who pay within the first 48 hours of the June 3rd news letter. Now since they were having issues with paypal they did extend it a little bit, but it probably will be no more than a couple hours.
