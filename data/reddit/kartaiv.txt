Heads up: 
Tried to go there to grab a drink with Bitcoin as I was passing by and they told me $25 minimum since only their managers are trained to accept Bitcoin and they would have to go get one.

It seems small, but it's not really that small -- $30 is 1% of $3,000. That means you'd have to sell $3000 as a business in Bitcoin sales per month just to break even with their "starter" tier....
It does become more attractive once your volume of Bitcoin sales grows, though.

I don't think giving out your password in any circumstances makes sense, but it's interesting to note that Coinbase does this exact same instant verification:

I ordered a several items last weekend and received them all already. Cheaper than the competition but just regular shipping costs were $100 (in the continental US)! Seems a bit high but overall netted a savings and supported Bitcoin! Would definitely buy again.

I bought the first Bitcoin haircut in the world here a couple years ago! It was a great haircut. :D

Compensation promises were made to trade-in customers and chip buyers due to extreme delays. Nothing has happened yet. When will this happen?

I do not see a Bitcoin donation option anywhere... just credit card and PayPal...

Received mine today and it was packaged well. Thanks for accepting Bitcoin!

Just a heads up -- I placed an order and received 20 confirmation emails all at once with different confirmation numbers.

Thanks. I was hoping to donate to patients or the universal fund. Any chance of that?
