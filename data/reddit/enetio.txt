where is the data, science and reasoning for the opposite? Please formally define centralization tradeoffs. And then please let me know on what platform I can post a response, because bitcoin-dev is not meant for such debates, and core has said many times they don't respect reddit as a platform.

To some degree. But there are no crypto-assets that have significance yet. Settlement is a confusing term in this context.

Adam Back is not even a core-dev - last I checked he has 0 commits to Bitcoin [1]. So whom does he represent? An individual who happens to be in the room?

That's part of employment law (the term really means exactly that):
"But generally, the contract of employment denotes a relationship of economic dependence and social subordination."
There are exceptions, and I know that blockstream employees have special agreements, and perhaps maaku is co-founder with special rights. In the case of non-profit the relationship would have been much clearer.

The "technical" explanation of why the consensus method is breaking, so that informal consensus can be reached? Bitcoin depends on individual choices. If roundtables are the new norm there is no reason to support the system as it exists.

The boss of blockstream can't order his employees to work on something? That's the definition of an employment contract.
