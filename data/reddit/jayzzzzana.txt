@_date: 2017-12-22 19:14:25
Yo! lets help the bull fight back
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:13:36
Bleeding wont stop.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:06:13
Relax. It will go up. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:21
Same here bruhh. haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:33:42
Massive $16k wall ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:28
we're probably just half way down the bottom. ugggh!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:42:00
I am waiting for the 12k dip
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:39:57
I'm feeling much better now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:03:08
What is the meaning of this? This shit is crazy. HODL till the end!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:09
I live for this shit. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:43:15
good catch.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:08:59
Still a lot of people about to wake up in horror and panic sell. 10k in the next 2 to 3 hours. Possible 8k at the end of the day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:01:30
Unleash the BULL!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:07
now it's gonna sit on low to mid 12K just like it did at every previous -1k stops. I predict this to bottom out at around 8K. 8K is where the real HODLers starts HODLING.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:15
You go girl!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:38
We need em fomos to break em walls
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:43:50
It is clear, sellers overpowers the buyers. The people who got in at 8K and above mostly due to media hype are not gonna buy anytime soon. Not enough fiat coming in to awaken the bull. Right now the ones playing the game are the traders, whales and Hodlers. The value will keep going south slowly. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:07
I dont like the idea either. I just bought a fraction of bitcoin valued at 12.3k earlier. I am hodling onto that. Staring at the chart leads me to believe what I just said above.
