It's probably the most any one individual has gotten in cryptocurrency, but it's unlikely it takes the record overall for fiat value. Who knows, though, by the time Bitcoin reaches it's full potential at one million per coin, it will probably take the record easily.

This earlier comment from you makes me think you might try it both ways: 


@_date: 2017-12-07 23:35:43
I guess he thought it was just another garbagecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:23
Well, the OP never said he couldn't afford to lose this money. For all we know, he may have bought in at $30 and sold at $18k, so this is just money he wanted to reinvest. My point is that Kraken is supposed to be the trustworthy intermediary here, NOT part of the risk equation. No one who invests in NASDAQ or the S&amp;P gets worried about sending this much money to Charles Schwab or JP Morgan. Kraken is under a lot of the same regulations, so they should be able to handle these deposits without causing OP undue stress.

Congrats. It won't be long until colleges and universities start taking tuition payment in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:37:50
Short answer: Yup.
Long answer: Absolutely.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:57:12
Okay, best of luck to you then. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:35:48
OH, please don't encourage this, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:23:30
You’re just adding fuel to the fire. Ver relishes the attention he gets from posts like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:01
So what do you think happened? You checked it five times, so did the address switch happen after you clicked confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:24:16
Excellent point. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:52:04
I'm having the same problem right now. Did you ever figure out how to fix it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:03:20
Scanning through and seeing all of those who lost coins to Mt. Gox, I wonder how Karpeles is still alive. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:32
LOL thank you for posting your stream-of-thought consciousness about this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:02:24
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:40:50
But that assumes you know that said person has only one address. Most people have multiple addresses, so unless you had them all, you’d never be able to truly know how much they hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:25:54
You don’t understand the entire reason for bitcoin if you think this is a good question. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:24:55
Almost 200 people died from these explosions. Let's not cheapen their deaths.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:32:41
But there wasn't any gain to pay taxes on in most cases. If I go to GDAX and buy one bitcoin and then immediately send it to binance to trade for an alt, I'm getting a 1:1 trade. So there is no gain to tax. I have yet to find the answer to this problem.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:22:21
Will this negate (or at least lessen) the need for Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:17:15
Thanks. There's a formula for everything, eh?
OK, so it looks like $1 million in 2037 is about $550k in today's dollars, assuming a 3% inflation rate.

You should rename your account to Bitcoin-Grinch.

Sorry. That stinks.

I don't understand the strange fixation on American nationals in this post. Most countries require citizens to pay some form of tax on any capital gains. 
Also, if they are truly "HODLers," then you're wrong. No one is coming for them because they haven't cashed out and realized any gains.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:17:49
Two things.
First, the actual population replacement rate is 2.1 children per couple. Anything less than that (including just 2.0) results in population decline. 
Second, I'm so glad no one has to listen to your dumb opinion on how many kids they should have. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:42:40
How were you broke in 2016 when you had thousands of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:52:53
The "never invest more than you are prepared to lose" mantra doesn't apply here. There's a big difference between losing money from bitcoin's volatility and losing money from a supposedly reputable exchange stealing the money you sent them.

Sounds like it's trying to sync all the blocks. If you're at 130k, it's going to be a while...probably several days before it finishes. You may want to try to sweep the private keys over to an electrum wallet. There are lots of tutorials if you google that process.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:53:02
So how do you reconnect it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:12:50
Heads up: Few of those who actually own any bitcoin are going to answer this question.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:14:29
Do they pay for outgoing bitcoin transactions like GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:39
If you have a wallet.dat file from those days, you may still have access to your bitcoins. Just download Bitcoin Core and replace the default wallet with your old wallet file. Once it syncs the blockchain past the date on which you bought your bitcoin (assuming they haven't been stolen since then), you should see how many you have.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:55:48
Honestly, this just looks like an excuse for you to include your affiliate link in order to get free bitcoins for yourself. And you know this is a highly-trafficked bitcoin site, so you are taking advantage of newbies who don’t realize this is a post with ulterior motives.

If the wallet is encrypted, you will never crack it without a quantum computer.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:44:14
Not to hijack the thread, but what tools did you use for this? Nothing that required private keys, right?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:24:21
They've offered to pay it in XRB or equivalent BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:07
That's a pretty big bitcoin sale.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:21:23
They even made a few that were a 1000 btc denomination. Today one of those coins would be worth $17 million.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:36:26


Read your post title again.
Also, stop bringing Trump into a discussion which has nothing to do with him to score cheap political points. In fact, you're acting exactly like Trump with all this childish name-calling. For what it's worth, I'm somewhat sympathetic to your overall point, but your reaction to criticism is very off-putting.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:43:31
Sure. I get that and wasn't confused about that kind of scenario. My question pertains to a situation where I go buy $100 of bitcoin at GDAX and then immediately tranfer it to Binance and trade it for some altcoin. There has been no gain in the short time it took to complete this scenario, so I don't see why there should be any gains taxes on the conversion. Hope that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:33:58
Log into your coinbase account. It will show the address you sent it to.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:09:43
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:31:36
GDAX pays the fee, so you shouldn't have even had the option to add one.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:50:28
Are we to assume that these are your property? Or are they still in “pawned” status, meaning you only hold them as security against a loan? Because unless you bought the computers and own them outright, what you are proposing is called theft. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:16:10
Yes, you can.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:32:20
I think we are saying the same thing. I guess the capital gains tax does apply, but it would be $0 since there was no gain? If so, that is still a massive headache to report every such transaction to the IRS. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:42:37
You want us to send you money for telling us what we already know? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:42
So you're going to try to steal bitcoins from addresses you think are inactive?

Does anybody know what $1 million will be worth in 2037 (in 2017 dollars)?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:56:43
Ok, but only if you also include something called the Thunder Network as an off-chain solution to low tx throughput.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:47
Good grief. What do you think Bitcoin is? A lost and found box at the YMCA?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:35:24
I'll just leave this here: 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:28:35
You and I are on the same page. How can you pay a tax on the conversion between btc and alts if there was no gain in fiat through the trade?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:07:48
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:02:45
Fair enough. People can make their own decisions. Good luck to you.
