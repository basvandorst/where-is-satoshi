They have trading set to "Post" only but yet those who are placing buy orders are $8000+ are getting filled. Very fishy.

The way bitcoin works for bitcoin is that the blocksize is 1mb. Now within this block fits about 2000-3000 transactions. Miners pick those with the highest fees to go first. (sato/byte) is how the fee is calculated. Now we are currently at about 280,000 unconfirmed  What happens is that people see the people waiting and instead of putting the same fee they raise theirs and before you know it your transaction sits at the bottom of the list! Right now there is a massive scaling issue going on. Check the fee chart here and compare it to the fee you have for an estimated time. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:01
Right, people are able to list offers but they don't get filled but yet those who are placing buy offers are.

I think you are confused, this is an exact copy of the blockchain... therefore everyone who "mined" btc, mined a BCH at the same time. Only those who had BTC on August 1st got the BCH. It wasn't just an ICO or anything.

Ok, then just simply buy some whether it takes 10 minutes or 1 hour it's possible to do so go ahead and get it done ! :D Good luck and hopefully the future of bitcoin is good and you can profit or spend it where you need to!

Hey, head over to Btw, cloud mining is all 100% based on gambling to make a return and for that reason many consider it a scam. Think of it like this, if company A has a machine that can produce "5 dollars" why would they sell you a contract for 4 dollars and give you the larger produce. Well, because it's a gamble the price produced drops and they are able to cut your contract keeping your full amount you paid months in advance. Good luck

The way transactions are "confirmed" is a "block" is being solved. On average, every 10 minutes a block is solved which confirms the most recent transactions up to 1mb. This means that there is the queue of everyone's orders being sent/received. The order is based on those paying the highest fee. Meaning your fee is very small compared to what others are paying. Aka you may have paid a 1 cent fee compared to people choosing a 10 cent fee. What this means is your transaction may take longer. The reason everything isn't "instant" is because bitcoin is run by everyone around the world and not one company. In order to secure the orders it relies on people (aka the miners) solving the proofs to confirm the transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:54:39
Well day trading makes it seem like you want "Instant buy" "Instant sell" it's not a stock so when they say "instant buy" they mean normally within 5 minutes. The first time may take 1 hour if you are new. Also if you are buying as an investment and it tanks right before you buy then that would of actually saved you money by not buying it at the higher price. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 01:53:32
Well sorta, it's all done by TONS of specialized software that is running numbers left and right by tons of people. They don't exactly "pick" who to confirm per say but it auto pushes those to the top who offer a higher fee. The "miners" are rewarded by a brand new 12.5 bitcoins + all the fees that come with confirming about "3000-4000" transactions at once. That is how bitcoin is produced and every 2016 blocks generated it gets more difficult to solve the transactions requiring more power to mine. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:34:13
is that trusted and how does that work?
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:56:18
Exactly, people always buy with the mindset "Oh this will be worth millions someday" when in reality the usa could print 10000 trillion dollars in a day and bitcoin would be worth over "millions" but it wouldn't mean anything. What matters is the purchasing power you can use it for, which is why you get bitcoin to use!
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:44:29
You have to understand the "hoops" are because identity fraud is a very real thing nowadays! No joke when someone pays with debit card or bank, or pretty much anything it can be charged back except for bitcoin which can never be disputed once sent. Best option is to just calmly go through hoops and get it. Bitcoin isn't a stock it's a currency so don't try and "day trade it" if you are buying as an investment buy with the mindset of holding it until you are ready to sell... Some people buy "x dollars" worth every "x days" so no matter the price it will be evenly spread in long run when it goes up. If you expect it to rise in long run a few dollars short term won't be that big of a problem 
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:18:25
ahh thanks, instead of paying the "Recommended" 2.14 fee I just did two transactions of 0.05 with 80 cent fees on each :D saved 50 cents! Fuck fees it's total bullshit when miners make there money off new coins 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:48:27
Depending on the state you live in it may not be money transmission. Reason being a "virtual currency" in some states is not legal tender in which selling it would be the same as selling any other product to a person.

No I'm saying from a logical standpoint I want to use bitcoins for what they are intended for being and that's - money. That's right... crazy as it sounds I'd like to send things to friends/purchase items etc but don't want to have to pay 3 dollars tax fee to get it there and hope it goes through within 1 hour... The "solution" of me just sending a massive amount at once or be "willing" to pay higher fees than just using another service like credit/debit/paypal with (lower fees atm) is stupid... Ik this thread is 99% people who only hype up bitcoin with dreams of one day cashing it out for lots of fiat currency, but I'd actually like to use it for what it's intended to be. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:15:50
What is the difference between gemini and coinbase? Plus, are people using bots to place buy/sell orders or is there just a massive amount of people quickly buying/selling so quick that it does it how it is? I think I signed up on the GDAX and I'm looking at everything happen so fast. I'm new to this but say I buy some bitcoin via bank account/debit card and I sell it later on the GDAX does it go into a GDAX balance where I could instantly use the funds to buy again or do I need to wait for bank transfers?

That's a bad idea... there are people pumping and dumping atm and I think since banks are closing down all users we are on the "Edge of a cliff" as Wallstreet journal said. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:51:43
BU will reduce the transaction fees being made by allowing more transactions to made in a "bigger" block size. This will reduce the demand to quickly be fit into the next block causing daily users to slowly join in when they realize the fees of using bitcoin are very slow. With the expansion of more users, the price of bitcoin will rise. However, atm the idea of using BU doesn't work because the coding just isn't up-to-par and there may be some problems trying to use it. Another minor concern is only "big companies" can manage to run a node that is allowing for bigger block sizes thus removing the decentralization away from bitcoin. Although to be fair technology is advancing and it soon won't even be difficult for the average person to have technology capable of supporting a bigger blockchain.
 TL-DR: People like to stick to things that have been working, the quote "If it ain't broke, don't fix it.” really works and sums it up because people generally in life are afraid of the fear of change, and like to stick to a pattern that has been working and not risk messing things up by trying to use something that isn't already flawless. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:11:03
well, for the most part, each year lots of money is printed, there's about a 1-3 percent inflation on everything caused by that. So each year prices go up slightly on things, but for it to be noticeable for like the price of bitcoin it would have to be super massive for bitcoin to hit 100k+
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:34:19
That makes no sense at all, suppose it gets banned the price would crash... what good would having tons privately be when the price crashes.
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:27:06
But the demand being produced seems fake, its all coming from a machine that says "oh everyone has been sending at 0.001 so lets do 0.0011.. etc but doesnt say "hey that 0.001 was 2$ yesterday and now is 300$ today are you sure you want to send that much" and thats because everyone just goes with it agreeing "hmm guess everyone else is paying it" its called hyper-inflation caused by demand-pull and its not exactly good because its increasing rapidly and thats because nothing is being done to adjust for a new higher bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:14:10
Yeah, that's debateable but realistically it won't be so high bitcoin goes over 100k+ in price this year. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:44:36
Hmm? New York? Btw you could always have your friend hand you cash and you send them bitcoin in which case you are fine :D
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:02:50
well in Britain they just put restrictions on it that are going to affect the prices. Guess what the prices have indeed been affected by the news. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:14:07
Hmm but with the rise in bitcoin in theory could people all band together and try to reduce some of the fee inflation? Like one day paying say 0.001 for a fee is 1.20 but say bitcoin in a while goes up and now 0.001 is worth 2.40... problem is the fee isnt adjusted for new rate and because everyone sends with "recommend fee" because every payment is at minimum now 2.4  the fee has doubled in money which is only worsened when people start increasing the amount of btc like .0015, .002 etc... what I mean is the current price of bitcoin has almost little to no effect on fees which seems dumb. Like say tomorrow bitcoin is worth 1 million dollars you'd still have to pay a .001 fee  to send because thats what the "average dynamically choosen one is" which means you would pay a $10000 dollar sending fee when in reality a logically person would say that while yes the "$ amount fee should go up" the amount of btc shouldnt. In other words at 1 million dollars you would want a fee to not go down in "$" but reduce in amount of btc to reflect that same amount..
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:45:48
yeah you can hold without spreading bs about how it will be 10k usd within the week because of something by warren buffet. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:31:15
Yeah but it seems like it doesn't scale, say ten days ago people were paying 0.001 fee and now people in a hurry pay 0.002 fee and now 0.003 etc but say 0.001 was only (1 dollar worth of btc) and now that same .001 is say 5 dollars worth but because every1 jumped in amount they are paying the 15 dollars worth of bitcoin when in reality they it would be a higher fee to still pay the 0.01 now as suppose to when they first paid it. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:56:48
Really? What if everyone started to panic sell?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:26:30
You have to understand the logic behind that statement. Most people who say that don't realize how supply/demand for an item/currency work. 
There's actually two ways it could go "1 million per 1 btc". 
The first being a massive demand of people buying bitcoin, not talking about a few new members we are talking like if entire countries everywhere started to panic buy. This is the least likely to happen in such an extreme rise but could.
The second which is the most likely is the USA dollar loses strength. Think about it like this, if say tomorrow 100 trillion dollars were printed there would be insane hyperinflation. The supply for the USD would be super high but with the same amount of demand. This shifts the equilibrium downward. What this means is yes a bitcoin would be worth more "USA dollars" but those dollars wouldn't be adjusted for inflation meaning your overall purchasing power of 1 million dollars would not be the same as it is today. 
TL-DR: 1st way = insane demand worldwide for btc
2nd way: some sort of financial crisis making inflation to the dollar go out of control. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:42:13
Not sure what you mean but fees can very easily be 2 dollars when everyone is trying to send. I had a 80 cent fee for about 50 dollars two days ago.

Perfect! Thanks so much for this info, now say I've got money on GDAX account and I buy some bitcoin. Later if I list that bitcoin for sale and it gets sold does the money deposit back into my GDAX account or does the USD get sent to my bank that is linked to GDAX?
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:14:10
Fair enough, but still explain how my transaction of 0.1 btc can go through with a 30 cent fee and 2 hours later sending 0.1 is "Your wallet needs to consolidate many smaller payments you've received in the past. This requires a relatively high fee in order to be confirmed quickly." and wants to charge a 2 dollar fee to send the same 0.1 btc amount?
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:27:13
Yes, I do use a dynamic fee one but what I mean is if it "recommends a 2 dollar fee" for everyone then they will do it but if every1 started sending with a 0.01 cent fee and refused to go over that, then what would happen? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:55:06
Do you not understand math, where do you think people are able to "make 120% interest" from holding a coin and get paid for it over time... you are just simply getting money from the next guy who signed up.

You can earn 'more' simply by holding and cost dollar averaging. Set up a budget and simply buy say "100$ usd of bitcoin every week at xx time" and now you end up buying more Bitcoin when it's cheaper and less when it peaks. Over time you will see the profit, don't worry about the first weeks, months etc all that matters is  knowing at some point in the future you will have made profit.
Now as for the other crypto's only hold onto those that you feel are safe and have a shot at becoming something, nobody knows with certainty which will lose/win but everyone has a different opinion so stick to yours and hold firm on choices to buy something. If something you buy crashes 10% don't just dump it to jump on board something that just rose 10%... it's foolish just be patient and in the long run, you will look back and see your hundreds turned into thousands or thousands into much more. Anyways good luck.

There is a legal way, and that is getting the proper licenses for whatever countries you wish to operate in.

Why is there an unlimited risk in futures? 
What is the benefit of using a future long etc if you owe money when the price declines or vice versa?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:46:03
has to do with the size of the bitcoin transaction. 
For example if I have a bitcoin generated and send it to you it comes in 1 chunk and is less data (bytes)
however, if I have 1 bitcoin but it's all from 10000 different users who sent me fractions, then it will be larger in (bytes) meaning I'll have to pay a greater fee to transfer. What that means is that small of an amount would probably cost quite a bit to attach it to the transaction will eat away.
Try to adjust your fees and clear cache.  use this fee to see the averages people use 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:18:08
Well.... I'm not a lawyer so I can't give you legal advice but I'd suggest getting into contact with one but this website possibly could be a good start 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:30:58
I don't think it's an issue at all. First, as long as your spending your money and not money that needs to be spent on other things (bills) then it is fine. 
Your success, in the end, is their success... I assume since they are family and I really doubt their thoughts would be to get angry or pissed at your profit if you told them the investments worked out... I mean you said it yourself "I got this retirement thing covered" so I assume you plan to share the wealth so its unlikely they get mad....
Now, on the other hand, you get them involved into crypto and it effectively doubles the risk of complications of not only you losing money but them losing money not fully understanding what they are getting into and just hopping on the bandwagon for something they don't believe in (based on what they said in the past).
Depending on your background in Finance/retirement plans maybe suggest to your wife to consider investing into it with an amount she is comfortable losing. Otherwise, I'd just continue to keep your position and if it works out it's a win for everyone if not then no big deal since only you are involved. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:31:24
Alright, so you can only trade based on borrowed funds aka the margin? In options, the max loss you can lose is the amount you paid in advanced for the premium? So for this, there is an unlimited risk when buying shorts? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:51:48
If you think it's going to magically produce a profit on its own then you are absurd? 
Do some research on what a currency is and you will find at the end of the days it's only worth something if people adopt and choose to accept it. Whether or not people accept the use of bitcoin will determine it's value... nothing more than supply/demand. 
The reason it continues to rise is that more continue to demand it, this demand might be artificial if people are all entirely demanding it to simply pass on to the next buyer but I'd disagree because when you compare the advantages of a decentralized electronic peer-to-peer cash transfer system to the standard practice of banks the blockchain technology wins hands down and is VERY likely to become mainstream in the years to come. Right now people are "speculating" that bitcoin will be that currency... either way it will be some form of cryptocurrency in the future so get used to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:03:55
No not at all, I think it's whatever wallet you are using currently is using a very high fee that might just be dynamic based on current traffic. Check the settings, clear cache. That seems like an amount that should be fine with sending it's odd for a message with that high of an amount. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:57:05
If you are in the United States this is illegal, 
not only that but there are hundreds of websites doing the same exact thing and if you buy your bitcoin off coinbase  ( the majority of usa do) and send it to a gambling site they are likely to shut down your account....
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:23:25
It's a whole lot harder than you think, these prices listed change very rapidly and when you withdraw and send to another account not only do you pay a fee to send, you also pay trading fees + an average exchange requires about 6 confirmations (1 hour minimum) by the time all of this happens it's too late. 
Think about it like this,
exchange 1 you buy for x dollars and send to exchange 2, it takes a while and even if the opportunity isn't gone you sell and have USD... now what are you going to do ? You get stuck because a usd transfer takes 3-4 days///
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:39:53
Generally, people put it on the dollar amount they are willing to risk. For example, if you only want to risk $500 or so, you'd simply adjust the limit to always reflect 500 less the day's high price. 
Or simply set it based on a percentage of risk you can handle like 5%,10% etc
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:54:25
You are quite indeed it's based on speculation but the question is to what extent? The market cap of the "bubble" was in the trillions and that was for the United States/// This market cap is in the hundreds of billions and can be popped by a few elite sellers dumping their 1k-10k bitcoin holdings.... the point is even if they did it wouldn't matter since in the long run it will continue to rise if more join. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:07:43

Website went down for 4 hours due to updating and all active order were canceled now it came online and people put in buy offers at crazy low prices. funny thing is people sold a bunch for some odd reason at 900-1100.. lucky to whoever was able to buy at that price.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:21:10
well, coinbase current price is based off GDAX, their trading service which was down for the hours. Assuming you were one of the first to get on the website and place an order as someone was selling it's possible. I don't think anyone listed 100 bitcoins at 1 dollar however and instantly within seconds people were putting in buy orders at 1000+ dollars. So a few orders did go through at I think it was 900 dollars but It would have been about 30 seconds before everything went back to normal. I was kinda late to the party (45 seconds - had to get 2fa code put in to log in) kinda lame but I was able to sell 0.5 btc at 1182 and rebuy 0.5 instantly for 1170 since prices were swinging fast. Anyways back to holding for me :D 
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:18:45
No it wasn't like an outage across coinbase. It was just their trading website GDAX that had a scheduled maintenance
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:24:57
Yeah, I was on and I saw people putting in buy offers at 1000+ bitcoins for that price at the same time people were listing 100+ bitcoins at 10000 dollars. I didn't see any sell but I did see a bunch (10-20) sell between 900-1100 as prices swung very quick.

On that link it says, As of July 25, 2017, you must be 18 or older to access Coinbase services.

at that point, dollars are simply pieces of paper with numbers. It very well could one day due to inflation. But it's unlikely as paper while it's value is minuscule the overall value of all EVER printed would probably still be higher than 1 btc.

All things equal if I have $500 to invest and can buy 500 coins at $1 or 0.077 BTC ($500 worth of $6500). 
If my Altcoins go up 50 cents.  I earn $250 dollars
To earn this same $250 I would need my bitcoin to go up $3250 dollars! Having only a fraction 1/10th means for every $10 gains in bitcoin I would make only $1....whereas owning 500 coins every 1 cent up gains $5

Lot's of different reasons. Think of crypto like a car. Fundamentally the use is to get from point A to point B. Right? So in a sense all cryptos need to be able to move from one place to another. Now each car has different specs, some are sports cars and move faster than others that are 18-wheelers and slow. Some people just have a preference for what model/brand of car they want. Some cars are cheaper than others. Some are luxury cars and have a high price. Etc there is a variety to please different peoples so that is why someone might selected something different.
Now to answer your crypto question more literally, it's because there are some cryptocurrencies that are private, some that transfer faster, some that have a lower sending cost.etc Also to some investors it's easier to make a profit if say they can buy 100 coins for $5000 instead of buying a bitcoin at $5000. (reducing risk by having diversification)  Nobody can predict the future so if say most go up there is a chance they might earn more than with 1 bitcoin. Plus say these coins are only $1 each, it might be more likely for them to go to like $5 (thus a rise of 400&amp; compared to bitcoin going up 400&amp;

If you think it will go down sell it, if not, then don't/// Otherwise this post is pointless. :s

Seeing as you only owe value in Yen why not try and make it up to those who still lost out with the extra. For example if your share is 40,000 btc why not evenly split it and pay like 25% of whatever people lost out on.

Well, I'd rather have the coders work out a few bugs here and there then all of bitcoin be crippled. I'm sorry but if people "expect" bitcoin to get massive worldwide currency it can't be impossible to use for the 1% of the world using it...

way 2 tell me what I already know :( 3 days ago when I was trying to leave I didn't know it was un-usable now I've been fucked $900+ because of how shit bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:00:39
I think your problem is you are letting emotions get the best of you. For example right now it's seconds after we see bitcoin shoot up $200 within the hour and your making a post that makes it seem like "AWW I should've gone all in and would have made X gains" and by your post you did the same thing the second you saw ripple going up and wanted to go in. Both currencies have strong points but when you commit you need to be there for the ride, when the coin doubles in price you can't buy-in hoping it will do it again the next day, you need to understand that long-term rise is actual growth and not just speculation price pumps from people trying to time it so they get "quick" cash... Just hold whatever coin you have bought if you believe in what you paid for. If not sell it off and buy something you have faith in and hold onto it.

Yeah, I think you are correct because the thing about anarcho-capitalism is they advocate for no government interference over the market at all but they key difference is they support the VOLUNTARY trade of private property etc... stealing would go against the idea and would be against the "natural laws" of a market. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:07:53
ok, so when can we have SegWit cuz wtf this is shit atm... 
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:36:37
No chances are you like most sent with a low fee. Right now there are tons of transactions being sent. 200,000+ unconfirmed. Every ten minutes about 2000-3000 with the highest fees get confirmed. That means it can take quite a while to get to you if it doesn't by 3 days the money should be refunded back into the sending wallet. Try to check how much the fee was and compare it to this which shows the average fee and average wait times. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:48:52
Hmm, Instant Paypal transfers for 3% fee or Bitcoin transfers at 3% fee + 24 hrs+ wait times....
I'm sorry but that is probably the entire reason fewer people are using bitcoin and the market cap has been shrinking...! Don't tell me that "I can pay a higher fee to speed up" because that's not an option on coinbase (number 1 USA bitcoin exchange)....
So yeah... I've not only lost money because of this delay I'm sure it's part of why bitcoin price is crashing and hasn't exploded because with a 10 minute transfer I could see btc going over 10000+ but not with these crazy ass wait times...
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:55:52
GDAX is their trading platform for those who are buying/selling. The reason they have that is because it's a little more complex than just hitting "buy/sell" to coinbase directly... it's based on whatever others are buying/selling at. 
For example if on GDAX the sellers lowest price is "1534.10" (should be in red) and the highest buyers is "1534.0" (In green) It means if you were to not be a "taker" you would have to either list a sell offer above the highest buyer which would be over "1534.0" etc.. on GDAX it goes by the 0.01 so be aware. Just hit "Limit" and check the "post Only' so you don't take the taker fee.

Yeah, I'm not trying to say things should be free either but a person at the store trying to buy a product shouldn't have to do a "bidding war" with a sending fee to get the item at a good price just because some1 in another country is spending their money. Like if the network can't handle getting people's transactions in Under 1 hour imo then it won't grow to everyday use. People in the 21st century expect things to be instant so just imagine if those who trust bitcoin have problems using it just how bad it would be with the entire world population on it. The goal for most should be long term use for bitcoin not short term price speculation to "time the market" which is why I'm trying to say either segwit or BU needs to happen, as a user I don't care which as long as it doesn't affect me which is how most see it or they will spend their money using some other service like paypal or WU. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:02:41
thank you, anyways the one confirmed is the 1st one that was sent 3 1/2 days ago that never was sent, it disappeared and then the person who tried to send to me again is the 2nd one you see with the higher fee. So what happens to that fee they paid on the 2nd one since it got double spend because of the first one randomly going out.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:11:52
I'm confused so did you not send it to the right wallet? If it confirmed whatever wallet you sent it to should have it?
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:27:59
This is a bad idea as your parents are looking out for you. If you have your own money you could always try and meet up with a friend and pay cash for bitcoin or you could try and buy some off localbitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:45:37
What do you mean by "non-trival" fees... I'm on coinbase a VERY popular exchange and can't even adjust fees and nothing will confirm ever because it seems like if you want to spend it you need to pay a massive fee. Just imagine right now if everyone in the world used bitcoin, there would be 10 million unconfirmed transactions!! Are you suggesting that everyone would need to pay like 10$ wire fees to buy stuff at a store otherwise they will need to wait 24 hours+ to have it transferred? I just don't see how anyone can see 200k+ and say "Yeah this is what bitcoin was meant to be"
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:11:19
"Bitcoin the cheapest way to transfer money" ..... common plz either segwit or bitcoin unlimited for real stop debates cuz the normal bitcoin users are getting screwed by investors... 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:18:00
Coinbase is an American company, they prefer to elevate the prices so they don't risk as much aka they sell you at a higher rate than market value for them holding onto currency for instant buys/sells.  If you want a cheaper rate to buy from other users on their exchange called GDAX where you can place buy offers and hope they get filled etc 
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:45:00
that article states it was for the year of 2015, with the price of bitcoin being very low it would have been easy to not report it. Now bitcoin is a little bit more mainstream so I'm sure well over 800 declare it.

have you gotten into one of your many rockets and taken a self funded trip to the moon you just bought?? If not HODL
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:35:10
Thanks for that Tom, I'm actually having some problems with not coinbase but the GDAX exchange itself, when I go to  and log in, it displays the trading screen for bitcoin but the page just seems to be missing a bunch of other coins to trade. It's very weird other than ltc/eth and btc I don't see the others that are very popular like Ripple and much more. Wondering if you could fix this issue so many people could happily trade :D
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:16:46
Not a glitch, bitcoin is at 213,000 unconfirmed transactions... and not getting any better because there isn't segwit or bitcoin unlimited... on a similar note bitcoin now has gone from 54% total market cap to now 47% as more people switch to more practical currencies that can be used in everyday life and not just for speculation
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:13:48
Alright well personally It's riskier to sell your coins at a loss and buy back bitcoin than to just hold. Reason I say this is many have already dumped ripple for btc and this could be just a short peak and you may miss time it again. Say you had 1 btc sold got ripple, if you sell at a loss for ripple and with btc price increase you might only be able to afford .5 btc now and it would be that much harder to make back your original money. Plus atm ripple hasn't done anything "exciting" give it a few years see what happens with the ones you bought.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:40:20
Basically, they would keep them, and chances are you'd lose a lot of money when the price of your coin drops since there are separate coins.  Get the coins from the exchange before July 31st. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:36:31
sell me all the ripple you got, I'll give you this bitcoin I got... btw don't expect to get the bitcoin in the next 100 years because I can't spend it :( ffs I've lost so much money just from today not being able to transfer my bitcoin. sorry for my rant

This asshole is the reason bitcoin crashed in price, and he further fueled it by dumping the funds in February on exchanges. He should get a 50-year sentence for the amount of money he stole and the destruction he caused.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:47:21
Yeah, when you sell it goes into your GDAX Wallet which allows you to instantly buy more ETH/LTC/BTC. From there you can withdraw funds to bank if you want but I think it has like a $10,000 daily limit which you can increase if requested etc
