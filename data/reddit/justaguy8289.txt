50 days ago you said “I made the jump hooray! I wish I could’ve bought the dip.” Why the change of heart?

Every trade is only potentially taxable. If you start the year by investing $500 of after tax dollars. You buy/sell/buy/sell and so on.... say you’re up $10k 6 months in and make a bad trade and end the year with $250 profit total. Your account would have $750. $500 is your cost basis and $250 is gain. It doesn’t matter how much you buy and sold throughout the year. The only thing that matters is ‘realized gains’ at year end.

Learn the definition of ‘Cost Basis’ and it should help answer all of your questions. Taxes are looking at at the end of the calendar year. You can buy and sell throughout the year and any gains you have at the end of the year are taxed as ordinary income. However if you’ve held the asset longer than 1 year it’s subject to ‘Capital Gains Tax’. (Google that too) taxes aren’t triggered until you realize a gain, meaning sell at a profit.

So you don’t adopt to save the dog, only to prevent mill profits? Now I see. ��

You are the definition of stupid. If a dog at a shelter dies, please tell me how it affects anyone anywhere? Leave emotions out of it. Other than a little fuel to make them ash. Which is much cheaper than the food to care for an animal no one cares to own.

It’s “ignorant money” asking for help. The “dumb money” is the ones keeping it on an exchange and not asking.

Na. Just annoyed at everyone harassing OP because he bought a puppy. Name calling isn’t a comeback my friend. If you have a logical response I’m all ears. Unfortunately what I say is true and you don’t have much ground to stand on. Adopting is for self gratification. It scratches an emotional itch. A brilliant marketing scheme really. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:28:06
Thank you oh wise one. ��

I’d be willing to be 70%+ of brokers don’t know the holdings in their clients portfolios. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:57:09
I believe calculate your original cost basis. Say $500 was how much you started with and you traded it up to $3000. Your taxable gain would be $2500. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:08:11
There are 1800 new coins added to circulation per day. That means we need 1800 X current price to maintain the current price. If more value is added than maintenance, the price rises. November 27th there was $168 billion. Yesterday there was $290 billion.

I say buy puppy from a breeder. Not everyone wants to buy a used toy. Put the shelters dogs to sleep if no one wants them. Dogs are literally here for people to enjoy and if no one want them... 2 dogs need a home. 1 at a shelter and one at a pet store. Regardless one didn’t go home with this person. Then you say “adopt, put breeders out of business!” To that I say, “where will you get your future used dog then?” Out with the old in with the new. Ammiright?
TLDR- off the shelter dogs if no one wants them. There’s literally NOTHING to lose.

I’ve owned dogs my entire life. Right now I own 2 pure bred German Shepherds that were bred by a private breeder who devotes her entire life to her pack. Her mother was a breeder and she herself began breeding at age 12. She’s now in her 50’s. Again, you brought your emotions into your comments and haven’t stated a single fact. You said buying from a puppy mill is the equivalent of the OP sticking heroin in their arm. I am still waiting for you to explain how. Once more, leave your emotions out of it. Let’s talk facts Snowflake.

Apples and oranges. You can't adorn yourself with bitcoin.

Transfer to a paper wallet. That way you have a tangible gift. Plus someone who knows nothing about it won't likely see the value in something that's solely digital.

That's true. Thank you. Even with copy paste I still get nervous. Triple check it every time!

Yeah. These guys are right. When coinbase offered $8900 or so the machine was at 10,200 plus $2. 
It’s more about the availability than the it being practical. Bitcoin having ATMs is a sign of stability to the naysayers.

There will be a day when fees are irrelevant and we will rejoice that these machines are already available. A day when bitcoin comes out of hiding in the digital world alone and becomes ‘tangible’ in a sense.
