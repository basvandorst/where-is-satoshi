Don't insult them. It's in Hamilton.

How many tries did this take? 
Was it hard growing up being a mixed race minority?
Does Volcom still exist? If so where is it sold?

Not if you preset a stop loss..

Or, you know, have a brain, take risks and make the most of the situation by selling quick and buying back the dip.

As someone who has access to hundreds of remote PCs and servers - the thought of doing this has crossed my mind. Then I remember I’d probably lose my job if caught and it becomes not worth it. 
The “hacker” is probably an employee of the signage company and he’s probably got a couple dozen of these floating around using 1/2 of the CPU power to make a few extra bucks a week in crypto.  The equipment might even be his, on “lease”.

I wish they did this before I maxed out all my credit cards on 18k bitcoin.

My boss and I have an agreed upon admin username/password “policy” between us (we’re really the only two with admin rights to everything). 
But yeah, there’s probably millions of remotely accessible PCs in this world with admin/admin begging to be mined on.

Do you build video walls?

You probably make more if you take that fiat from the recycled parts and buy crypto, lol. It just sounds labor intensive. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:11:43
Sounds like you got a lot of video cards floating around

I have 1 old server and 1 old desktop mining Monero on my test bench at my office. The two of them together produce &gt; 700h/s. Since last Friday, those two machines have produced around .05 XMR. 
Take it for it is, which is not much, however everything that hits my test bench winds up mining for a bit... it takes a minute to set up, and after a while I have a nice little stash of “surprise” crypto. 
My favorite is when I get PCs that are used to output video walls. 4x 4 GPU video wall PCs? Yeah those are gonna sit on my bench for a while. 
If I know it’s gonna hit the trash pile, and it can mine, it’ll mine until I don’t have room on the test bench anymore.
