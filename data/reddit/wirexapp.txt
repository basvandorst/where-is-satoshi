On the main page you got a Bitcoin Price. This is the price for **buying bitcoin** on Wirex. When you got and load your card, You get a different price. The exchange rate is different for both operations. So, It's no a fee

I'll invite you to try the new Wirex card. By requesting your card on the new Wirex Mobile App, You can get a free Virtual Visa Prepaid Debit card you can top up using Bitcoins. If you verify your card, you can also top it with Alternative methods like PayPal, or fast bank transfers. Finally, you can request your physical MasterCard any time you want.
Download the app and drive your money :P

At Wirex we want to help bring about mass adoption; and we feel that scaleability, and transnational capability is necessary to achieve this. We feel that SegWit is the best way to increase capacity, that is currently available.
If you don't want to use Bitcoin to transact with others, and you don't mind paying up to $130 in fees. Then you don't need a mobile SegWit wallet.
For those that want to bring about a financial revolution; I expect that they will keep the majority of their funds in their hardware, and a small amount on the go that they can transact with quickly and cheaply.
Why can't you have a node at home with a SegWit enabled hard wallet as home (like an ATM) and a mobile SegWit wallet on your phone (like cash)?

Nice!! 
SegWit is a soft Bitcoin Fork that will make your transactions happen up to 6x cheaper/faster, which will help mainstream adoption.
The issue is partially because miners can put out 'spam' transactions that make it impossible for a cheap transaction to get confirmed. Manipulating the ecosystem for their own gains, and making Bitcoin less useful as a means of transactions. Who wants to pay $15 tx fee for a $5 tx?

At Wirex we want to help bring about mass adoption; and we feel that scaleability, and transnational capability is necessary to achieve this. We feel that SegWit is the best way to increase capacity, that is currently available.
If you don't want to use Bitcoin to transact with others, and you don't mind paying up to $130 in fees. Then you don't need a mobile SegWit wallet.
For those that want to bring about a financial revolution; I expect that they will keep the majority of their funds in their hardware, and a small amount on the go that they can transact with quickly and cheaply.
Why can't you have a node at home with a SegWit enabled hard wallet as home (like an ATM) and a mobile SegWit wallet on your phone (like cash)?
 If you guy's need a mobile SegWit compatible wallet to go with your hard wallets. Look no further:
Also, free and instant Bitcoin TX within the Wirex ecosystem.

Why have your cards stopped working?
- Current cards cancelled by Issuer 
- Your money is safe, refunds will be issued

- New cards coming soon
Yesterday, our card issuer WaveCrest received direction from Visa to immediately close all accounts. Unfortunately, we were given little notice by the supplier to prepare for this change. 
Customer funds will be transferred back to Bitcoin from prepaid Visa accounts.
We are working around the clock with our new providers to bring you globally available Contactless Cards as soon as possible.

SegWit is a soft Bitcoin Fork that will make your transactions happen up to 6x cheaper/faster.
Miners can put out 'spam' transactions that make it impossible for a cheap transaction to get confirmed. Manipulating the ecosystem for their own gains, and making Bitcoin less useful as a means of transactions.

Our users range from those who work in the bitcoin community from developers all the way through. We also have users who use our cards because they work for bitcoin in the developing world and need a way to use it locally. Others who have it because their families send them bitcoin as remittance as a cost effective alternative to other remittance companies. Our users are all over and very diverse. Many of them live in locations bitcoin is not highly accepted. We get tremendous user feedback about how their bitcoin debit cards have changed their lives. So while you do not agree, there are many who are happy to have access to better financial solutions.

We agree spending bitcoin directly is the best option. The more people who are working for bitcoin will help it continue to grow as well. With Wirex/E-Coin wallets are secured their BitGo so we do not control the users bitcoin. Now its 2016 and bitcoin is still not accepted widely(I know 100,000 merchants but on a global scale its small). Merchant adoption is falling in numbers and is failing to really catch on. A lot of people use bitcoin as a means to transfer value to another person cheaply. Using the bitcoin for practical purposes is still a challenge. We allow people to use their bitcoin everywhere. Now we have introduced buy bitcoin. We support many different methods to buy bitcoin. So until merchant adoption continues to grow we offer people an easy and practical way to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 11:09:32
This is correct.

Right now we have a 0% fee. The only fee you will have right now is from PayPal a $5 fee to withdraw PayPal to your E-Coin debit card. So if you have money on your card the fee is the current exchange rate.

Its great that you are able to live with only bitcoin. I would think you are one of the few with the the locations around you and the time to only shop at places that accept bitcoin directly. We offer services to people from all over the world. Many of whom do not have the luxuries as you.

Hello again Zooganger. As Usual, I can help you as much as possible. Just send me your support ticket number and I will check with the team.
Regarding the issue you mention:
1) This depends on the Blockchain. Sometimes Bitgo, our partner in bitcoin security and transactions, assigns the Blockchain fee to speed up transactions, and sometimes the fee is too high for the amount you want to withdraw. It's a known issue and we are sure It will be solved in the next release. For now, it's not entirely on our hands, so if you need help about this, contact the support team.
2) There's not live chat active yet. The only support channel Wirex has in the email support Also, you can request help in any of our social media Channels, but only after you wrote a support ticket.
3) I don't understand this one. Obviously no one in the support team knows you have an issue until you send a ticket. The support team takes 2 to 5 days to answer any support request. We know is not optimal, but we are working on it. As you know, if you think your issue has taken too long to be answered, you can contact our social media channels and we will made our best to speed things up.
Hope this can help you understand a bit more about Wirex. As I said before, If you need help, Just send me your support ticket number and I will check with the team.

With the new capital, the company plans on introducing host of new features including new bitcoin-based financial products, contactless bitcoin payments and cards, as well as support for additional currencies.

This is from TechCrunch from about 11 months ago. You can see the merchant adoption numbers falling.  This was happening before E-Coin, and Xapo came into the scene with growing users. Will the bitcoin cards last? This is debatable. As you just said, it is working well as a transition, but will be become obsolete.... I don't see anything but more usage from this point forward. We had over 100,000 user signups in the first year and are continuing to grow fast.

UK-based fiat and cryptocurrency online banking platform Wirex has announced it has raised $3 mln from Japanese SBI Group.
Wirex, which offers consumer products such as crypto-denominated debit cards, will use the funds for “development of new features, licensing and security, as well as a support to its expansion plans.”
However, the partnership anticipates a key breakout for Wirex into the Asia-Pacific market, Japan, in particular, having become the world’s number one arena for Bitcoin trading.

The best news!
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:39:47
Hello. An exchange rate and a fee are not the same thing. A "fee" relates to an individual service (issuing a permit, pulling a tooth, selling bitcoins), while a "rate" refers to the price per unit (or minute or day or whatever you want to assign this price). We calculate the rates based on the market in the Wirex platform and the current bitcoin price all around the world.
On Wirex there are two exchange rates: One for buying bitcoins and one for loading the card. The "Buy Bitcoin" rate is higher than one for "Load Card". But other than that, What you see is what you get. There are no fees for loading your card or Buying Bitcoins in Wirex / E-Coin.
To verify this, please go to the website  and search the Bitcoin Address number Wirex gave you to deposit your bitcoins on the right corner search panel. Then, compare the amount of bitcoins you sent to this address with the amount you received on Wirex. It should be practically the same.

Wirex have been around for 3 years already, and developed the service way further than any other bitcoin debit card service. Why bother "scamming" our users, When we can aim for long term success?

Hello [ImageMan]( Technically, It is possible to get an Unverified Virtual Visa in Wirex. You just need to have a valid address in the country you want to request your card.
For a plastic card, it is a different matter, as You need a verifiable address and a Valid ID to be able to get the plastic card from this country.
Either way, I will recommend you to try the Wirex Virtual Card. Remember, If you request your FIRST VIRTUAL CARD on the Wirex Mobile app, it will be completely free.

Hello [IkeaNestingInstinct]( I don't understand where do you come out with things like this, but Wirex / E-Coin has an option for Transfering your BTC out of your Wirex Wallet. If you already used your BTC to load your card, you can go to the E-Coin website and buy bitcoins with your balance, then withdraw them from Wirex. Finally, if you don't want to verify your account and has reached the limits of your card, you can request a refunds in bitcoins.
The KYC process Wirex does it handle by the card issuing bank, and they have certain standards for the documents they required. It goes without mention that they response time is quite slow.
So, anyway, I think you are quite confused about the nature of your issue. I can help you speed things up a bit. if you want, Please send me your support ticket number and I will investigate more on the matter.

I think you do not understand what you have to do, and that's why you have refused to back up your claim. If you won't comply with the information support is asking from you, How can they help you? Just search your funds, look up where those transaction you made come from, and back up what you are saying. That's all they are asking you for

Hello [herhusbandhans!]( I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. If you please can give me the support ticket number, I might be able to check the issue with the team and help you up.
Also, I will like to mention something: On Wirex, there are two exchange rates: One for buying bitcoins and one for loading the card. The "Buying Bitcoin" rate is higher than one for Loading Bitcoins. But other than that, What you see is what you get. 
So, maybe what happened was that, to put it simple, You need to have more BTC on your balance than the amount you have right now. When you try to load your card, the minimum amount is 10 USD, PLUS the blockchain fee, which as you know might vary depending on how busy is the blockchain. 
But this is all speculation. I know Wirex support team takes a lot of time answering, and for that I'm sorry. We are trying to do anything We can to improved Wirex support service. Please send me your support ticket number and I will let you know as soon as the team answers.

Hello again, mate. As I already explained on private message, you are correct in one thing. The information in our website is incorrect. Check this link on the help website for the new limits based on the new Wirex mechanics: 
We are sorry you got the wrong information. However, What the support team told you is correct. So you really need to verify your account, and we cannot make any difference in the system because it's a bank policy. If you prefer, contact the support team and request a more throughout explanation.

Thank you for the feedback. We are getting many similar stories of how people are using their cards globally.

With our mobile banking application you can choose which currency you want to hold. You can hold bitcoin, USD, EURO, or GBP. You can hold some of each if you like and easy conversions. We offer virtual and plastic cards which you can use to use your money, withdraw from ATM, or you can send to someone else inside Wirex.
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:13:51
I am not sure where you are getting your stats from. We are a funded company and we stand behind the numbers we have released as we can verify them.  As we have a very versatile card our users have been getting our cards for more than just bitcoin to fiat. If you check around companies such as Coin Base now have 2 Million users, and other companies are rising fast as well.

We offer the ability to load your card at the rate of your choice. This gives our users the ability to convert when the price is favourable. We offer 24/7 support which we feel is necessary even for an early stage startup because bitcoin works 24/7 and is a global currency.

All cards and accounts will remain the same. You now will have more services to go along with your card. You can buy bitcoin, 1 touch conversions between fiat and btc, and mobile banking. Here is a blog post about the rebranding. 
@_date: 2016-09-02 01:47:16
Check Wirex. It's an interesting choice and works in almost all Europe. You load your Debit Card with Bitcoins and use it everywhere where Visa or Mastercard is accepted. Also, if you request your first virtual card from the app, it's free.
@_date: 2016-02-28 12:49:38
I can see its not so clear. Basically Wirex will offer buy and sell bitcoin. When you sell bitcoin it is loaded to your card and can be used in an ATM, online, etc... Basically you can convert bitcoin to fiat or fiat to bitcoin at the rate you like. So if the price goes to $450 and you want to convert 2 bitcoin to USD then you can load your card and use it, or buy bitcoin later on when the price drops. This is different than some cards that do not let users take advantage of the market by only converting at time of use.

Hi; I am the community manager for Wirex. 
Wirex was founded by Pavel Matveev and Dmitry Lazarichev who were both huge contributors to the original Bitcoin community and big believers in Satoshi's goal of complete de-centralisation. 
As a matter of fact all of us here see this is as the ultimate goal. The de-centralisation of finance.
The question is; how long will this take?
Will all the merchants around the world start accepting Bitcoin from tomorrow?
When your friends ask you how easy is it to spend Bitcoin's or even Altcoins; how do you respond?
How easy is it to use those returns from Bittrex and Polo to buy groceries?
Wirex is aiming to bring Crypto Currencies to the mainstream, so that the main stream can get accustomed to decentralisation.
We can't do this without having a transitional period, and we are here to provide this.
We will continue to reach out to the community and will support them in completing Satoshi's goal of decentralisation of financial instruments. 
Visa costs are not minuscule, Crypto costs can be; unfortunately it will take longer than a few days for merchants to realise this.
The original Wirex business model was for a direct bitcoin transaction payment card, useful ‘anywhere Bitcoin is accepted’. 
Well, market adoption has been a little slower than we hoped. 
We also recognise the brilliance of many ‘altcoin’ projects and welcome some level of partnership with any honest projects focused on real-world solutions, driven by committed and technically savvy teams.   
If you wish to get in touch about how we can do this; you can email me here at Wirex:

Wirex debuted its first Bitcoin debit card in July 2016, to allow the growing Bitcoin userbase to transact in any Visa or Mastercard-supported stores, retail outlets, and e-commerce platforms using the digital currency.
As an initiative to reduce friction between Bitcoin and other leading currencies, the UK-based startup added some innovative features that support banking operations and the purchase of Bitcoin through mainstream payment service providers like PayPal.
Although the Wirex team still believes that Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency in the market, the company states that the importance of addressing alternative cryptocurrency users must be realized, considering the rapid growth of other major digital currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero.

Unfortunately, our partner bank cannot issue cards to US addresses, and that's not their decision or choice either, it's what regulators enforce.

Hello. 
The Wirex platform (both web &amp; apps) will be under scheduled maintenance (from July 31, 2017 UTC to August 2, 2017 UTC) , so no one would be able to access their accounts, deposit/withdraw funds or exchange.
We do this to protect all customer funds from being adversely affected by any replay attacks and/or chain reorganizations that may result from the activation of SegWit.
Cards will continue to work normally during the downtime. If you'd like to have access to your funds during this period, we suggest you to load your card(s) BEFORE the scheduled maintenance.
Moreover, in the possible scenario of a hardfork, users who have bitcoins stored in their Wirex wallets will be able to redeem the "hardforked" coins as well.
We understand restricting access to your funds is an unpleasant decision, however we assure you that our main focus is security and integrity of your funds.
We are following the situation closely and we will notify everyone as soon as we have an update.
Best Regards,
Wirex Team
