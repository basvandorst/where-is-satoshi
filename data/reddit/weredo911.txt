Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency correct? They sure as hell aren't the first to accept cryptocurrencies.

Here's a firm in Manchester, UK that believes they were the first to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.

The Mintpal exchange first announced they were being taken over by Moolah.io a few months ago. Moolah promised they were going to make the exchange better by upgrading to what they called Mintpal V2. The official migration date was set for October 1st. October 1st rolls by and a notice goes up, stating it will take up to 24 hours complete the process. 
...and 6 days go by. 
Moolah gave 12-hour "open exchange" countdowns on the official Twitter account every 12 hours for a good 6 days.
So what happens when the site goes back up? The new UI is buggy as all hell, trading is glitchy, and most importantly, **a large amount of accounts are missing.**
Personally, I'm out far too many Bitcoin, and I'm pissed.
