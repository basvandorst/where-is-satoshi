The creator of Bitcoin would be smart enough, to have a lot of the early coins which are not known to be his. He would also know that using any of the old coins would panic the market and potentially set his invention years back.
He could have plenty of coins from the $0,1-$3 era, which he can use/sell without any consequences. Still making him a multi-millionaire.

What about "donating"/lending 1 BTC out through Kiva? It is a micro-loan organisation for developing countries. So you can keep re-lending the money, which will benefit many people (they get cheap access to capital).

If he threw away the keys, then he should have done a verifiable burn of the coins, so everybody knows that they are gone. Now, we are just in limbo, which suggests that he still has the keys.

I don't think many people want to see Greece's economy fail. But when people are suggesting the greeks (which are in an unstable economic situation) to invest in bitcoin, it's not to protect the interests of the greeks. It's to protect their investment.


Of course it would? Higher adoption = higher price.
Edit: spelling mistake.

No thank you. UFC is personally one of the last sports I would have bitcoin support. I would much rather support E-sports, if anything.
Sidenote, I don't belief this will be as successful as dogecoin was with Nascar. One of the reasons dogecoin was succesful with Nascar, was the humour aspect of dogecoin in and of itself. Bitcoin is not "funny" in the same way.

The wallet holds all your keys. So lose access to your wallet, and you lose your keys.
The keys is what gives you control over the bitcoins, the wallet is just a service to organise your keys. Maybe think of it as a traditional wallet, if you lose your wallet, you lose access to the money(keys) in that wallet. Makes sense?
One of the advantages is that, since it's digital, you can make multiple backups of your wallet, in case you lose one.

Quick translation:
According to Liberal Alliance, they are writing history in a local division in Hvidovre(small danish town). The local division will soon be the first local division in the world to use the blockchain for voting.
It will happen at the next general assembly, later today.
The blockchain is a technology, which today is particularly known from the bitcoin-market. The technology consist of a special kind of database, which is ongoing updated with the present changes in a long chain of datablocks.
For instance, in relation to bitcoin, then all of the transactions of bitcoins will be saved in a seperate datablock in a large blockchain database, which will keep account of the total volume of bitcoins.
The cunning aspect of the technology, is that it is incredibly hard to change the existing content, since every new datablock also has a reference to the previously block in the chain. That is why Liberal Alliance thinks the technology is particularly interesting in conjunction with e-elections.
“The blockchain removes the need for trust, since the technology can run autonomous without interference from people, and it is at the same time open source and transpararent, so that everybody can look under the hood, to take a look at how it functions. It doesn’t get any more liberal - so that’s why it’s an obvious choice for e-elections” Says Mikkel Freltoft Krogsholm in the party’s press release.
The Party explains in the press release, that a specific vote could be defined as a contract in a blockchain, where everybody, in principle, could keep watch and make sure that the vote is keeping the framework of the contract.
Since the informations in the chain, as mentioned, are transparente, it gives the indivudual the option to control, that his/hers vote has been counted. Furthermore would all parties have the possibility to control the result of the election.
“The blockchain technology can be a bit tough to understand, but basically it’s about decentralising and democratizing everything from money to organisations. So from a liberal ideolgic point of view, it was a opportunity we just had to take. Liberal Alliance in Hvidovre will be the first local divison for any party in the world, to use this technology in their voting processes.” says Mikkel Freltoft Krogsholm.

Is this correct understood?
* If i buy some PETA units, I own a part of the PetaMine's total TH/s. Right? 
* This would also mean that by buying some PETA units, I "own" some GH/s that are then being pointed at a P2P-pool. Still correct? 
* Would this mean that I would collect a (however small) part of the mining reward, every time that the P2P-pool finds a block?
* And these PETA unit I would then be able to sell again, whenever I pleased?
If this is totally wrong, could someone enlighten me? :)

I hope, for the sake of the network, that he would be mining alone.
I would also assume that someone, who own 11% of the total network hash rate (according to himself and the math made by and in this thread), knows the risk of combining too much mining power.
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:10:01

@_date: 2014-02-03 12:19:20


But why would you do that? When it is just as easy to spend bitcoins as it is to spend dogecoins.


Why not both?
It is true, that probably the majority of bitcoin holders are speculating and holding for a future gain. But that does not eliminate simultaneously spending the bitcoins you have.
Think of it this way, if you have 1 bitcoin and needed to buy 1 orange(value of 0.1 bitcoin). Why would you change the 1 bitcoin to 20 dogecoins, and thereafter pay 2 dogecoins for the orange? When you could just as well have paid 0.1 bitcoin in the first place.

@_date: 2014-12-29 19:40:43


Maybe, but not likely. The price of bitcoin is only a question of supply and demand. Right now the supply is expanding with 3600 new coins per day, and apparently the demand for bitcoins is not that high, which is why the price is falling.
My personal believe/hope: The price will start rising sometime in the next 6 months. This will lead to a media attention with the theme of "Bitcoin is not dead, and it's rising again!" which will draw new people in and make it a positive feedback-loop. This will keep going into maybe the late 2015/early 2016, where we'll likely see another crash.

Price declining doesn't necessary mean that people are losing interest. There are currently being created 25 * 6 * 24=3.600 bitcoins per day, which (valued at $300) is around $1 million created per day. Let's say half of that is being put on the exchanges (you can argue more or less). If people aren't buying bitcoin for $500.000 a day, then the price is going down. There could come $400.000 of "new to bitcoin" money into the bitcoin economy, and the price would still be falling.

@_date: 2015-05-27 00:15:38
Well the price is supposed to have all future benefits and risks factored in. So in theory the next halving shouldn't matter in regards to the price.
Now in real life, I agree with you. I just think that the price will start to go up before the halving, in anticipation of the halving. Makes sense?
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:10:32
Mate, that is not the worst-case scenario. 
Worst-case is that a fundamental flaw in the bitcoin protocol is found. If that's the case, then nobody would use bitcoin, because it would not be safe.

Everybody who owns bitcoin, believes that this drop is only temporary. Otherwise you wouldn't own them..
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:29:18


They have it backwards. The mining reward being halved, would (theoretically) halve the 'production' of new bitcoin. When the supply of new bitcoins falls, then (if demand stays the same) the price would rise.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:36:06
I would still argue that they get it wrong.


 The way they phrased it, makes it seams as Bitcoin is trying to compensate the miners, by increasing the value of individual coins. But in reality, it is only the result of lower supply. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:07:04


Well, if it ever becomes relevant in the future, then a relatively simple software update will allow 1 bitcoin to be 100,000,000,000 or 100,000,000,000,000,000 smaller units. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:15:34
If you want to gamble with something you know little about? Go ahead. If you want to invest, then do your due dilligence and read about what it is you are investing into. 
Right now, "investing" into Bitcoin (without during it as a small percentage of your total portofolio) is just gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:41:51
If those coins are ever moved, then people will panic. There is only one reason to move those coins now and that is if the owner is intending to sell. 
Every reasonable person would sell a good portion of their holdings just as a precaution, which would create a panic. Even if the owner/Satoshi didn't sell.

Then you don't know basic supply and demand theory. The price would plummet. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:26:04
BTC might be an obvious solution long term for those regions. But right now, it's not. People living with double digits annual inflation wants security, which BTC does not currently offer (more established currencies such as the Euro or Dollar offer security).
Long term, BTC might offer security. But we will need many years of stability on a much higher price level in order to claim that BTC offers security as opposed to fiat currencies.  
I would also argue/guess that most of the price of BTC is by investment from countries/regions with financial stability, where people have money to speculate with. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:54:12
A 10% reduction is a normal day in bitcoin. If the crash is coming, it will probably be a 50-75% correction, maybe even higher. Just look at the previous bubbles and tell me that “this time it’s different”

I didn't say that. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:28:57
Most of the price of Bitcoin today is the result of speculation, not because people have lost faith in fiat currencies (paper money). Everyone I know that have Bitcoin is because of the huge potential technologically or because of the price increase.  
**Not because they have lost faith in fiat.** 
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:09:28
If the volume is very low, then the fixed costs will be placed on the few and the percentage-fee will therefore be high. Once(and if) volume gets big, fixed costs remain the same, and the fee should go down.
But in all, the fixed costs are probably pretty low.

Doesn't seem like an optimal solution. What if the price jumps up, and never hits 325 again? Then you refrained from buying and lost all the gains, for what? A potential 10% increase? Let's be fair and say that people that are buying bitcoins are gambling, and are all hoping for that 100-1000% growth. 10% doesn't matter here, but losing out in total does.

It definitely is. But you should watch it for entertainment, not for buying opportunities. It has been shown that when people are trying to time the market (buy at the optimal time), they perform worse than average (as in, the market will out-perform them).

I would say that we would need prolonged time with continued increasing price, an unusual optimism in the news, and maybe even new people investing. In 1 week, new people can barely get money unto the exchanges, let alone buy bitcoin.

Day-trading is the name for trading currencies, stocks, bonds, etc. on exchanges. It isn't actual trade for products.

Better a lazy implementation than no implementation. When/if the volume gets large enough, they will probably implement it better.

But didn't Satoshi post in March 2014 claiming not to be Dorian Satoshi?
If Dave Kleiman was Satoshi, and Kleiman died in 2013, he couldn't have posted that message.

You said it yourself. Gold has a multi trillion dollar market cap, bitcoin has a few billion. I think any correlation is purely coincidental.

It might have been a very small bubble. But when looking over the timeline of bitcoin, this bubble will not be remembered. 
So far I know, there has been 3 big bubbles in bitcoins history, this "bubble" will not be remembered, therefore I choose not to call it a bubble. 
I think we are in the teritory between a bubble and "normal" fluctuations, so any definition is going to be blurry. But in my opinion, no, this was not a bubble.

Damn. And that is expected to increase in the following years? Assuming bitcoin is getting more popular. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:08:30
The price is going up, are you suggesting we hold the price down?

Invest half now, and half if/when it crashes. 
Doing that, you'll make money if bitcoins keep rising in value, and you'll still get to buy when there is a correction. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:22:12
The last time bitcoin was the most popular search term, was just before the crash in april right? 
Meaning that we may be only weeks from the next correction. Buckle yourselves in boys, we're in for a bumpy ride! :D
@_date: 2013-11-03 12:03:04
Well no. You still have the exact same amount of money. Inflation is when you money lose value.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:10:20
Remember remember the 27th of November
When Bitcoins rose to the top.
I can think of no reason 
why the Bitcoin increasing should ever be forgot.

That depends on what the US government/FBI/Police/whoever confiscated the bitcoins, does. If they are smart, they wont destroy them (since it's money). If not, and they do delete them (and DPR hasn't made a backup, which he probably/hopefully did), they are gone for good.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:37:32
That's an interesting theory. I was afraid we were going to see a massive sell-off soon, but it seems right that, besides investing in BitPay, the Warren Buffett of Asia would also buy a shitload of bitcoins.

This. Then whatever happens, you'll earn from it. 
Price rise? Good thing you already have some. 
Price falls? Well, now is the time to buy for the remaining 50%!

Nice explaining, understood your point and a good one too. 
But, *"So happy, in fact, that my next loan could be 100 apples today for 100 apples back in 5 years, since I'll still make 10 pounds on the difference."* 
Nobody would even lend money without taking an interest. The 10 pounds would be made either way, so why risk lending it?
There will **always** be an interest in loans. But an deflationary currency does indeed encourages lending.

For my initial purchase of bitcoins, I used Bitcoinnordic. I did that because of the relatively long approval period for Mt.Gox. 
Don't know any other alternatives, but will be monitoring this thread to explore ;)
Side question, does anybody know when the euro-part of mt.gox will be live again? :)

1. Get a job.
2. Make momey off said job.
3. Buy bitcoins.
4. ????
5. Profit.

Sounds like a standard customer service response. But can you imagine the rise in bitcoin value if Google implemented it!

Question about backups.
I understand the basic idea of a backup.
Let's say I backup my wallet.dat on my macbook. What if my macbook totally crashes? I mean dead, burned up in a fire dead.
Can I still use my backup wallet.dat file on another computer?
And if so, then by making multiple backups, you are increasing the change of theft and thereby your bitcoin wallet?
I don't fully understand this concept :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:19:29
Damn, I would LOVE to support it! But since I'm only 21, and the club is 23+, that's not going to happen.. You'll see me there in 2 years, I promise!
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:41:08
People were talking about we need competition to BitPay? Well, now we have it! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:59:09
Yeah you're right. Fixed. Thanks! :)

That's how it's written in many countries that are not english speaking, for example Denmark. This is really a pain in the ass, when you have an english math/economics textbook, and you are used to write one thousand as 1.000 and not like 1,000. So annoying! :D 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:11:24
Yeah don't all agree on this? Who can make it happen?
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:23:31
Excatly, just as banks function today with dollars, euroes and so forth.
I haven't heard anything about a bitcoin bank being established. Yet. 
And i don't think it will be done until the bitcoin currency have settled down. Although it should technically be possible with no regards to the value of bitcoins vs other currencies, as any interrests would be paid in bitcoin.
Wanna start a bitcoin bank together? :D

Don't know how good google translate are for you guys, so a translation:
**Warning against virtual currencies (bitcoin among others)**
The European Banking Authority (EPA) has released a warning to consumers against virtual currencies, including bitcoin. The danish FSA supports the warning.
EBA reminds the consumers of the fact that there are a number of risks connected to buying, selling and owning virtual currencies. 
* *You risk to lose your virtual currency on a trading platform* 
* *You risk, that virtual currency being stolen from your electronic wallet*
* *You have no certainty for, that you will continue to be able to use the virtual currency as a payment mechanism, or that you can exchange bitcoins back to real currency.*
* *The value of you virtual currencies could change quickly and could principally fall to zero.*
* *Virtual currencies could be misused for crime.*
* *Buying and selling of virtual currencies can have consequences in relation to taxes.*
Bitcoin has lately been in the center of significant media attention. There is no public data concerning how widespread Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is used in Denmark.
The danish FSA has estimated, that virtual currency is not covered of the present financial regulation in Denmark. The danish FSA has in a specific case therefore approved that a company does not need permission to establish itself in this country with the intentions of doing business with exchanging real currencies against the so called virtual currencies, including bitcoin.
As a reasoning of this decision, the danish FSA has evaluated, that the activity neither could be considered as issuing of electronic money, a range of payment services, currency exchange, reception of loan or as a investment company, and that the activity therefore is not included of the financial regulation.
**Background Information concerning virtual currencies**
Virtual currencies are a form of unregulated electronic money  which, in contrast to real money, is not issued and guaranteed by a central bank, and could in some cases be used as a payment mechanism.
Virtual currencies has been seen in different forms, first in connection with online gambling companies and in social networks. Virtual currency has later developed into being used a an alternative to real currency.
Bitcoin is the most widespread virtual currency, but also LiteCoin, ZeroCoin and Linden Dollars could also be mentioned as among the more well known.
Bitcoin is exchanged today with real currency and is accepted as a payment mechanism in a still risen extent, both online and offline in the ordinary economy by purchasing goods and services.

Even if it's unprofitable to get in *now*, a lot of the miners already paid the money for the equipment. And by keeping it on, they minimize their loses :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:46:30
All the bitcoins that the US government confiscated may well be lost. I don't see it likely that the US government would just delete the money, but I guess you never know :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:17:26
Same as in Denmark.. But isn't that the case in most western countries nowadays? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:39:05
So that's why! I was afraid my macbook was beginning to fall apart!

Then let's hope the price of bitcoins isn't at $2k when you get the bonus ;)
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:11:01
Indeed. But that does not exclude fractional reserve banking. 
If you had 1.000 BTC and wanted to keep it safe, you could trust a bank to keep it safe for you. The bank would then take you bitcoins, promising to give it back to you whenever you want it, and then lend it out to other people. 
Just the same as currency today, *if* you were to place your money in a bank.
