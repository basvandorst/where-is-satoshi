Hi all, noticed my article was shared here. Also noticed that people have questions about my intentions. So, here’s what led to the work. Because I loved the results of PlanB’s analysis, I needed to verify if the underlying model was right. A high R2 is only a first step. So, I ran the same analysis to have a closer look at all the test values and had to run some additional tests because the residual plot was worrying me.
Fact is that stock-to-flow ratio is a nice measure to express soundness of money, but OLS regressing it on price/mkt cap unfortunately doesn’t bring valid results.
In order to show what I meant, I also ran a similar test where stock-to-flow was replaced by the cumulative number of shits one takes on a monthly basis. ( It showed similar results. That can be explained because of regressing two trending variables on each other (while they should be stationary).
So what to think of my work and intentions? I consider plan B a great guy. We talk regularly and discuss how we could come to a better model. We met in person and had lunch. The idea of using S2F as an explanatory variable is really nice and should deserve follow up research. I applaud him for that. Unfortunately though, that doesn’t mean that every model we build with that measure will lead to statistically valid or significant results. 
What is next? I am currently working on finding a model that shows good results and also meets all the underlying model assumptions.
This starts with having a good dataset.
TLDR: PlanB is a good guy, we have fundamentally the same idea about bitcoin, but the model based on OLS is academically proven to be rejected.
