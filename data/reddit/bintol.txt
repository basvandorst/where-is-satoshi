You do realize that purchasing fractions of a coin is an option? We can invest $1 into BTC at any price. Of course, the amount of coin that $1 purchases will be less when the price is $40K.
Having been involved with BTC since 2013, people were saying the exact same thing that you in regards to $1000, $5000. Certainly $20K was laughed at.
I was telling my friend on the phone this afternoon, as we were discussing how we had a hard time comprehending that the price would ever get to $6000 a couple of years ago. Now for it to stay relatively stable there is impressive as a new floor has obviously been reached. I believe we will almost certainly see the price rice to $100K by 2020. We are following an exponential curve with great consistency. With more investors coming, it will happen. The question is when? Maybe by early 2019 even?

Bitcoin already took flight.

I've always been optimistic with Bitcoin. It's up over 750% in the past 3 years alone. I never look at one single year for Bitcoin which is a growing entity. It's saturation is so tiny compared to where it's going to be within the next decade. Whales can do their thing. Hell, they're going to be doing their thing for years to come, that's a given, but their pumps have always been the catalyst for bullruns in Bitcoin. If they see indication of momentum they'll obviously wait to dump a higher price just like they did last year. Why dump 4k when you can dump 10k, or whatever.

Coinbase volume is 15x higher on BCH than usual... considering the whole buy side book is &lt;3000 coins and close to 30k have traded in the last 24 hours... looks like a game of hot FOMO potato with a couple extra pumps of sour cream.
