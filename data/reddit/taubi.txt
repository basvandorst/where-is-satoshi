I find it interesting, how before all this conspiracy stuff got going, everyone how stupid and incompetent Mark was (and there certainly was evidence for that).
But now all of a sudden he's some sort of a genius leaving clues all over the place Da Vinci's code style messing with secret agents and shit.
I mean this whole situation certainly stinks to high heaven and we don't know the half of it, but delwing into some conspiracy theories won't help us one bit.

OP is probably referencing the exploitation of African countries by modern day France, where the monetary policies are tightly controlled by France.
It's explained better in this [video](

Wait, so if I have some BTC stored on a paper wallet, and a split occurs I can use those BTC on both forks? So I essentially double my BTCs?

Yeah I'm aware that it would only double the BTC value, while probably even losing on the FIAT side of things.
I'm just surprised that you can get to keep BTC on both forks, I just assumed that as soon as you send BTC on one fork the others disappear so to speak. I guess this is what you are speaking about with the lack of 'replay protection'. 
So If I have BTC stored on a Trezor lets say, I can then choose which fork my BTC will go down, potentially even on both forks?

Yeah, I actually applied for an account when BC was ~180$, and then waited for the authorization of my account and for the money to get through... meanwhile the value more than doubled :'(. 
Oh how I hope I'll be looking at this post a few years from now smiling from ear to ear :D
