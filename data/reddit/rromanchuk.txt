I think he's just trying to say a state with coercive power may manipulate the market interest rate as a mean to an end, good intentions or not, and that tends to price the market risk incorrectly leading to malinvestments, business cycles, and hurting the borrowers/creditors depending on the direction, who were the last people to get the colloquial "newly printed money" 
or maybe he just meant what he meant lol

I can repro Segmentation fault (core dumped), every time. Did you ever track that down? 
Ran it under gdb and got:

You can't talk about coffee and then just randomly jump to thousand dollar items being sold at best buy. No shit it has a different risk profile. Confirmations aren't the *only* method of risk mitigation you know.

Not really sure if that's the best metric...

Thanks, sent you some btc.

Did *you* actually read the deprioritization code? First of all, if you don't want this protection you can disable it with a very simple flag. If you're running a full node, you're literally announcing your daemon to the world. This privacy fear mongering is nonsensical.

FYI: I don't think a single line of code has been written yet.

Hi Balaji, I see 21 is voting for BIP100, but I haven't seen you talking publicly about it besides this vote. Care to share your thoughts?

my only guess is he launched his client, got the address,  sent the address to payee, and sometime between payment he deleted his wallet, got confused where 1HG6A4fCnVEKR25T9GgVxH9vVyTv5eLn87 was, and clicked  "new address" and added it thinking that's just how bitcoin works.

it's strange to me that pywallet didn't recover any of the full wallet files already sitting on the drive. Doesn't that seem wrong?   
 &lt;-- interesting
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:56:18
Isn't it strange that someone added this to the address book? Clearly someone was confused...
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:16:37
