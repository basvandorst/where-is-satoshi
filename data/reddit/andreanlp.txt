I agree, no incentive and many costs.
Computer works worse for other tasks while it's syncing and it's necessary a lot of memory, what are incentives for a slow pc and 300 gb occupied? With a normal computer is impossible to mine.

Blockchain is not downloaded continuously from one source, it could be fake.
Then the time to download it very longer, I needed one week to download monero's blockchain and it's less then 80 gb, to download an unique 80gb file with my connection I would have needed a couple of hours.

Yes, the only issue is the Cuban currency/bitcoin change.
How can they do it? By a normale exchange like bitstamp? And if yes, they have to send money to exchanges from their bank accounts. But I don't know if they're allowed.
I'd like to undestand how they get bitcoins from their currencies. 
When they have bitcoin they can use them if they have Internet and where they are and their central bank don't matter.
My only doubt is about how they get bitcoins from their currency? 
This is a central point on my opinion:
bitcoins are perfect and a government cannot know the physical owner. The weak moment is the change from the fiat to bitcoin. 
There are 2 ways to get bitcoin with no government knowing that person is getting bitcoins:
mining and to buy them local using cash.
But these methods are not always possible in practice.

I use Bitcoins, but I don't understand why if the goal is to escape from a currency with an incredible high inflation, the advantage of Bitcoin instead of changing in any other currency with low inflation rate (Euro for example).

Speaking about Italy for example. Italy doesn't have same problems of Cuba or Venezuela, this is sure. But Italian goverment is quite greedy (taxation on investments, on capital gains...) and to have foreign bank accounts is perfectly legal and they are easy to get, also online.
An Italian citizen who lives in Italy can have foreign bank accounts but they are subject also to Italian taxation. While it's difficult for the government to have any claim on bitcoins.
I think the reason could be similar, but it's just my hypothesis

And how they buy Bitcoins? Don't bank allow flows to foreign bank accounts, but do they allow flows to exchanges?
Thank you for the answer, I'm trying to understand Bitcoin/crypto currencies phenomenon in a more complete way.

It's a my hypothesis and I don't know if it's correct. But is it possible it's illegal for Cuban citizens (and the same in Venezuela, Argentina...) to have bank account in foreign currencies or are they simply highly taxed? While on bitcoins a goverment cannot have claims or at least it's easier to elude them.
