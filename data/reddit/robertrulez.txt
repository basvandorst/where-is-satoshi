I'll hold some long term but I'm hoping it's at 25k next year because I'll be graduating from law school and I need some funds to start my business.

Like I said, no smoking gun. If there was a smoking gun proving that Trump is what you say he is, he'd be impeached immediately, but there isn't and it's time to accept that. Oh, and good luck with trying to make the world work without the most economically powerful and influential country on the planet. Good luck with that bby.

illegals can pay taxes with tax paying identification numbers 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:03:58
Yes and also normal people are starting to take notice. It's making the rounds on all new outlets. My mom had no idea what it was when I started investing in it but she told me it's been playing on the spanish language news.

supposed to be today at 5pm CT according to the website
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:49:42
thats a potential provision as part of the new tax bill, it isnt law yet. as of today, switching ltc to btc is still considered a like kind exchange for tax purposes meaning that there is no gain to be taxed
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:03:25
im hoping it dips to 16 so i can buy in. I dont feel comfortable buying at 17k
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:05:58
Again, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) has to be changed by congress in order for exchanging crypto to be considered a taxable event. You're correct in that crypto could be considered property but like kind exchanges apply to property as well so you're only proving my point further. Sincerely, a law student. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:22:13
Agreed, the one's denying America's dominance are butthurt Europeans who hate the fact that Trump is not politically correct and won't bend over to their PC will. Source - American living in Europe. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:48:28
SO BITTER OMG lol, it's honestly laughable to read how much it hurts you that he's our president. Like I said, no smoking gun, no impeachment -- It just ain't gonna happen. And who said I'm not interested in the actual world? I do want the best for the world but the PC culture coming from the western hemisphere liberals is honestly nauseating, and this is coming from a registered democrat. 
and believe me, it's not about "coming back". My country is still at the top despite Trump, and that hasn't changed/won't change.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:10:43
You say you're not mad, but sorry to break it to you, you're coming off as VERY bitter. The USA has suffered through bad leadership (Bush), but we still managed to thrive. However, Trump has proven himself to be an effective leader in accomplishing many of the things he promised during the campaign trail. Most importantly, the economy continues to flourish with low unemployment, high GDP growth, and a record breaking stock market. But yeah keep arguing that America is slipping. Maybe instead of worrying so much about us, you can channel that energy to your own country -- Australia isn't doing so hot, hasn't your GDP collapsed the past few years? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:26:40
Made 500 bucks on ether the past couple of days and sold that shit and bought the btc dip. did i win?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:15
Yes. You don't pay taxes when switching dollars to euros, that's preposterous. Until Congress explicitly changes the IRC, exchanging crypto is not a taxable event. Tax professional =/= lawyer 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:40:52
Lol sorry bud but you should take a look at Australia's gdp charts, it aint pretty. As for Trump being ineffective? He's been in office for less than a year and has done a ton of damage to democrat causes. And I am a registered democrat -- I plan on voting for Bernie or Warren. But I'm also objective and can not STAND the European moral elitism that I as an American, studying in Europe, have to suffer through. Objectively speaking, Trump is a brash, awful man, but he's trying to do everything that he campaigned for, and as someone who's disillusioned by candidates who tend to do the exact opposite, I commend Trump. As long as our economy continues to flourish and as long as we as a people continue to get richer, Trump will win a second term. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:31:59
Give me a break, there's absolutely no evidence supporting any of those claims you made. He wouldn't be president if there was a smoking gun, and there isn't. QQ more. And I voted for Hillary too, but Europeans, especially Germans think they're so morally superior to Americans and they're so fucking butthurt that he won, it's HILARIOUS to see. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:28:47
NO. Law student here who took Federal Income Tax. You don't pay any taxes until you realize your gain (converting BTC to USD). If you by chance happen to buy a computer or something else with BTC, then that is realizing your gain as well.

@_date: 2017-11-20 09:27:25
LOL no. The US is the most resilient country on the planet. We have suffered from bad leadership before and still, we are the number one country on the planet. Objectively speaking, our economy is still growing and doing extremely well with wage growth set to grow and unemployment to drop in the next few years. Keep dreaming. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:19:27
lol duh, the question is not if it will hit 10k this year, the question is when. Will it be this week, next? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:06:02
hmm I didn't know that. I'll look into it. Thx!

How the fuck does that prove anything? Zimbabwe is a poor country while the US is the most relevant with the foremost premier currency on the planet. If there is a recession and people start losing their jobs, people sure as hell won't be spending their cash on bitcoin, they'll be  spending it on things that they NEED. I'm on the BTC hype train no doubt but you need to be realistic about these things.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:16:10
Educate yourself. The value of the dollar is strong and it's getting even stronger next year with the rise of interest rates. It doesn't matter what your opinion on the government is, the USD is still the most important currency on the planet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:15
Point is, yall were saying it was gonna happen right at 10. It didntt.

Finally someone who's actually on the money. You are correct!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:50:51
My strategy is to set a realistic target and hodl until you get to it, then sell. I got in at 4.2k and I seriously thought I hit the top end of the market. Then the china ban happened and omg seeing my investment disappear was awful. I was so tempted to sell in order to recuperate but I listened to this subreddit and hodled. Now I've made thousands of dollars and I'm extremely happy. I'm gonna hodl on until the 10k range and then I'll start considering selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:25:23
yet you noobs will exchange your bitcoin for fiat eventually, please stahp with the idiocy
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:08:23
no it's not, if the us economy collapses, less people will have funds to invest in BTC. Less demand for BTC, lower prices. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:35:21
Lol 45k is a lot?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:36:58
I hope you're not American, because if you are, shorting the American dollar will affect you negatively. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:39:16
That's great that you're building credit at 18 but please take into consideration that in order to have a good credit score, you cant have a usage rate of more than 30%. Thus, if you have a balance of more than $90, your credit score will drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:30:13
10k in a few days is a little too crazy. Maybe in a couple of months though

Yeah I know it's the world reserve currency but that won't last long if China has its ways.

I bought at 4.5k and it dropped to 3.2k, it sucks but you just gotta HODL.

@_date: 2017-09-13 17:56:39
Serious question, when will the price go back up tho? I bought in at 4.5k and now I feel like a jackass. :(

You clearly haven't met the Chinese. Of course, they are a wonderful people with a lovely history and culture, but the thing is, they laugh at us. They think they're superior and the crazy thing is, they are, at least at working and intelligence. They steal our innovations, they manipulate their currency, and are scheming their way to the top. However, they are a communist country and their way of thinking is reflective of that. Name one profound Chinese invention of the best two decades that has changed the world... You can't.

Please don't listen to these morons, no one can predict the price of bitcoin. If I had listened to random noobs on this subreddit, I'd have lost thousands of dollars by now. Follow the news about bitcoin and if there's some kind of indicator (a major country banning it for example) that the price will drop, then it's likely it will drop. Other than that, bitcoin is just going to keep rising. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:10:49

Well we're two decades into the century and the US is still leading in civilization changing innovations. The biggest innovations of the century thus far, have been American (windows, android, and iPhone). Americans are leading the way in the next biggest innovation, electric transportation (Tesla and Chevrolet Volt). Through the internet, our music, movies, and films are even more widespread in the world than they were at the beginning of the century. Undoubtedly, the Chinese are far more intelligent than Americans, but we are the most creative. But you might be right, this century might be Asia's.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:23:35


Yep, just keep an eye on this subreddit. If there's some big news implying a dip then go ahead and sell. China news was on the front page days before it actually happened and when it did happen, Bitcoin tumbled and that was a great time to buy. If I see anymore negative news, I'll definitely be selling but right now it looks like bitcoin will keep on going up!
