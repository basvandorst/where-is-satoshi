Very high level arguments going on here at I see.

Transaction fees were not an issue for BTC until recently and since it became an issue the BTC market dominance has dropped from around 95% to 55%. I believe there is causation (and not merely correlation) going on here. What do you think?

It's not very strange if the BCH community talks more about BTC in a negative light than the other way around. After all it's the disagreement with the technical vision of BTC that drives us to BCH. Without the disagreement there would have been no Bitcoin Cash.
If you instead consider the actual arguments used by both sides in an unbiased manner you will probably find, like me, that the level of argumentation here at is more trollish, relying on false information/misleading memes/conspiracy theories/smearing of individual BCH supporters compared to Anyway, kudos for keeping an open mind and not blindly trusting either or or anything else on the internet :)

Amen. Ver is not a BCH representative or spokesperson, just another supporter. [Guilt by association]( is not an argument.

That's exactly what it measures. Market cap has grown in USD yes, but altcoins have gained relatively more than Bitcoin. Therefore Bitcoin has lost market dominance (in %).


What do you mean, are they too small to bother with or do you not see significant transaction fees as a problem?


Bitcoin is right now because of the high fees. There was actually a time where you would get a discount for using Bitcoin compared to credit card, because it was cheaper for the merchant.


What market does it come from then? Isn't the purpose of the LN to make these kinds of transactions possible again? I still believe there is a huge market here, but sure, I could be wrong. If I'm wrong though, I don't see any value in using Bitcoin at all personally.


It's still in alpha stage and there is plenty of time and lots of questions to be answered before it can be actually used by a large number of users on the main network. In the meantime, BTC is gonna suffer.

No. Quote from [Wikipedia](


I believe that new Bitcoin users wants cheap and reliable transactions, or adoption will stall. Which is a big deal in a young market.

I'm not sure what metric you refer to here. I'm referring to [this]( which I bet you can't influence even 0.1%.

Trying to stall quick, easy, temporary scaling solutions so that complex, bug-prone 2L scaling solutions currently in early R&amp;D stage need to be rushed instead is frankly more reckless.

If you are free to create your own measure, you could also define your currency as the only cryptocurrency and get 100% dominance.
I never said measuring market dominance is easy.

Altcoin or not. Many more people are holding BCH than other coins due to the shared history with Bitcoin, a big advantage when it comes to fast adoption.
We need to think more about the market needs right now instead of spending years trying to build the perfect product. Remember VHS beat Betamax.
