You seem to know what you're talking about, do you know somewhere better to get signed certs? I hate all this certificate signing business...
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:43:33
Oh right, fair enough, I'll change that then.

Only just set up https, what's wrong with it? I'll make https optional if it's stopping you from accessing it.
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:31:18
Yeah that's a pretty solid idea, I don't really know why I've gone with a free one so far. Do you know a good place to get one?
EDIT: If anyone knows somewhere that accepts bitcoin that would be awesome.

I think this is now fixed. I had a javascript loaded with http and the module for recaptcha I was using used an if statement to check whether the connection was https, but I've got nginx in front of it which is doing the https, so it got confused. I replaced that and I think it's working, on firefox and chrome theres a lock by the url which is promising.

True. I'll get myself another domain.
@_date: 2013-07-18 02:19:39
I guess, although it would be a fair bit of effort. You could make two accounts and play against yourself if you like. I'll try and keep an eye on it as much as I can and play anyone that joins.

What browser are you using? Do you have addons such as noscript? There is no box to tick, you accept by registering.

I figured a B for bitcoin would be more useful than a billion satoshis, but I guess that's confusing. You got any suggestions for another way to do it?
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:39:31
The thing with the units is you can type them in the bet box, so you don't have to type 100000000 or something, you can just type 1B. Do you think 1B and 1b would work, one of them being a bitcoin, and one being a billion?

I'm not from the US, why should I be worried about serving US customers? Pretty sure the guys who run sealswithclubs are from the US aren't they, and they're not in prison...

They accept bitcoin for their domains but unfortunately not for their certs as far as I can work out :(
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:19:16
What is it you like about them? Is there anything we could add that would entice you? It says on their site that an HTML5 client will be out in May, is that May next year or is it delayed?
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:59:47
I can't find it on their site, is it out?
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:22:34
It's on the to-do list, I definitely want to implement this. Thanks for the links, they're really interesting.
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:33:22
about play money, I've given everyone who has signed up so far a tiny amount of bitcoin. I'm kind of torn on the idea of a free money mode, playing with satoshis is so close to play money, but it'd be an easier way to try it out.
@_date: 2013-07-17 22:30:36
That's just so you know what units you can enter in the boxes. If you're in a game with blinds of 1,000,000 chips it'd be pretty inconvenient to have to type all those zeros every time you wanted to bet, so instead you can just type 1M or 5M or whatever
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:57:59
I'm pretty sure it was at the time I wrote that. Could you point me to another one? I haven't found one.
@_date: 2013-07-17 22:31:01
Did not know that, thanks
