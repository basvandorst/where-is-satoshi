Andreas will definitely be on national tv soon, and probably make a big impact.

Agreed. We need more people in the community who want to adopt it for what it is. It benefits btc in general so much more than traders causing the price to sky rocket. If more people started actually using btc, it would help to stabilize the market, making it more valuable in that aspect. 
Although the insane price increase is helping to fuel the development.

Congrats for you! It's risky as hell, but this is exactly the kind of adoption the crypto community needs. People like this are what bring companies and other people to start accepting it as a form of currency. I think this type of adoption does nothing but help push the community in the right direction. The daily trading is what creates volatility. 
There's a chance you end up losing if the price crashes and it's ultimate value is significantly lower than what it is now (which I don't think will happen), but that's only a few weeks worth of paychecks. :D
Good luck!

Andreas is the reason why I'm head first in the crypto space now, and even encouraged to study more about computer science to understand it at a deeper level. He got me so excited about this new technology, to the point where I want to adopt it as much as possible. I am one of the few who want to adopt not to reach my moon, but instead to help push our economy into a self-banked society. 
I don't see how anyone can say he doesn't know that much about the core code, when he wrote the damn book on the subject (all of which are available for free). I know a lot of smart, talented programmers who recommend his book and lectures, not just his speeches on the revolution.

I believe it has to do with the fact that mobile OSes are more restricted than those on PCs. For example, an iPhone owner can't even access the file structure of his own device without jailbreaking it. Plus they're consistently getting updated on new protocols, where as Windows and Macs have been running on the same shit for years. I think this is the broad concept anyway, I don't know much about the actual logistics. 
Funny how John McAfee actually states the opposite.  Claims that your smartphone is insanely easy to hack, and getting easier by the day. When in doubt; hardware wallet!

This is not a get rich quick scheme, this is a "get free" scheme;
