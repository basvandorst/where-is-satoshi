Because people keep buying it. 


Because it's a good store of value. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:16:43
Right. My post was sarcastic showing the circular logic some people have 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:27:29
When satire and reality start to blend, we have a problem. And by we I mean the people who actually believe the circular reasoning. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:26:52
It's titled 'Electronic Peer to Peer Cash System'.  I thought bitcoin was a store of value?  When will I be able to use it as cash?
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:03:50
Can't you just show the bank transactions from the coin exchanges to prove your innocence? 
I mean, you should be innocent until proven guilty, no doubt. Just wondering. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:57:19
I bought at 1k before it crashed to 200 in 2013. It will be OK. 
Timing could be better... But just remember it's a long term investment and that you didn't risk more than you were willing to lose.

How long does it take to get verified on Kraken? I'm going for Tier 1 ID verification and it's taken over a day so far...

I sold out of my bitcoin a little bit ago for the same reason. I still think it will go up tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:24
People will be wishing for those prices someday soon.

'Store of wealth'
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:19
But it can't kill the financial system until it becomes widely adopted as a currency.
It can't become widely adopted as a currency when the price chart explodes and crashes constantly.  Even if it simply continues to explode, it will be useless.  It needs to stabilize.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:47
What the fuck is the point of a digital currency if the value of the currency changes by thousands of dollars over the course of one week?
I'm glad for everyone who's net worth is increasing.  
I'm confused as to what practical use bitcoin has anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:34:42
Thought I could time the market and sell at 10k.
Lesson to newbies... don't ever try to time the market.  Just fucking hold this digital gold forever.

Their means are different, but both would upset the status quo.  That's a win to me.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:31:01
What's causing that? Their housing situation? Inflation? 
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:17:34
Setting up bread wallet now, getting my bit coin off of coin base. Thanks for the heads up. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:27:25
We don't need another year as bad as 2008... but we do need a major Event on a similar scale that directly impacts the American stock market, retirement accounts, or housing.
To be clear I'm not rooting for this kind of Event.
But that is what would be required to really send bitcoin to the moon.  We're still in Planet Earth's stratosphere as far as I'm concerned.  $3,500 is nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:48
Yup.  That's where I'm at.  Hopefully it doesn't crash to $5k by the time I get it into coinbase.  Told myself I'd sell at 10k and have been working all night and this morning just to get the stuff into coinbase.  For being the currency of the future it's awful cumbersome just to send coins.
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:43:37
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:12:45
breadwallet work?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:56:48
Too soon.  Not there yet.  Don't jinx it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:07:46
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:20:58
No shit!  How can I get that BCH?  I actually use breadwallet on my android.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:38:01
Finally got all my confirmations, coinbase wallet updated, and was able to sell.  Huge transaction fee tho, $145!  Got $9,750 or something like that.  Will take a week to deposit in my bank.
Can't wait for the dip to buy back in :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:17:50
What a cock tease btc has been today.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:41
Looks like we're back up over 10k for the time being at least.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:05
Lots of people selling I think.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:10:37
I'm hodling that bch till the moon.  Got it set up in coinomi tho, thanks.
Was planning to sell btc at 10k but I think I'm just gonna keep enjoying this ride for now.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:14:54
This is like if Jesus just casually strolled into church on Sunday, wearing a bitcoin shirt. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:11:38


We fall asleep every night therefore we will keep on waking up every night for the future ad infinitum. Science. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:31:56
Also said that they'd give you X bitcoin 2x for every bitcoin you have on their site.
Is it worth putting my bitcoin onto coin base just for a couple days to get the new things or what? 
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:50:12
I bought one at $1k.  Oh well.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:57:25
My btc is on paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:23:37
I was about to purchase parts to build a PC on newegg.com, oh, just a couple months ago.  I figured $1,100 would get me a fairly decent PC, like maybe 90th percentile, Skyrim almost to the max.
Now? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:59:37
It could spike to $5k, or $10k, before the bubble pops.  I'm not sure how steep the climbs have been in the past but I'm sure the highs are a little less high at this point, and the lows a little less low, now that it's market cap is so much bigger.
We're in a bubble, yeah.  But how far into it?  I'd guess it gets to 3-5 k before correcting to 1.5-2.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:20:21
But do you have all the nice shiny texture mods
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:40:34
I'm in the same exact spot and am holding on.
This train ain't stopping and I don't need the USD.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:46:47
Oh yeah I remember setting that up. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:55:56
Gov't could make a law saying that any company who transacts in Bitcoin will need to pay a 50% tax on it.
So newegg for example, instead of you buying parts for a new PC for 1 bitcoin...  that will cost newegg 0.5 bitcoins.  They could enforce this through audits, and shut you down if you don't pay the tax.
Then they won't let people pay via bitcoin anymore because it's too expensive.  Then bitcoin loses its mainstream value.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:39:46
Any educated guess, once bitcoin stabilizes, how high 1 bitcoin could be worth? $100k?
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:52:39
What's "the scaling issue" ?
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:06:44
Thanks.  If I just scan the 'secret'/'private key, I think it automatically processes a "send funds" from that paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:04:44
What's the best way to store one bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:39:24
This one hurts
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:09:39
3k. To. DAY!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:34:36
So, all this talk about 1 BTC=$1M USD is basically garbage?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:28:26
Why?  Is there risk just keeping it in coinbase?  Or is blockchain more convenient?
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:51:47


I'll still be hodling...
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:53:56


Which is what makes it so great.  Normal financial standards are to print, print, print, inflate, inflate, inflate, regulate, tax, redistribute, repeat.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:59:46
It's like the world record time for a man running the mile.
5 minutes per mile used to be incredibly fast.  Then 4:30.  Then 4:10.  Then when the 4 minute mile was broken, it was one of the greatest feats in history.  
The current world record is 3:43.13.  Can the world record really get lower, forever?
**Yes, this metric can get better forever.**  But here's the kicker -- after a certain point, this number stabilizes, and "better" is trivial.  Instead of shaving 10 seconds off, 5 seconds off, individual seconds off the time, we'll get to a point where new world records are set by tenths, hundredths of a second.  This metric can only go so far.
Bitcoin will, at some point, hit an all time high and never break that mark -- until the next time it hits an all time high.  But those gains will not be dramatic, and it will take a long time to get there.
Bitcoin, if it truly is here to stay, will stabilize at a certain point.  $10k?  $50k?  $100k?  No way to know.  But if/when it becomes mainstream -- I mean *truly* mainstream -- currency, we might be happy with 3% year over year growth, instead of the double digit growth we're seeing now.  Then once it reaches that point, it will start to fall to 2%, 1%, half-percent year over year growth, until it doesn't, or until the Government gets its hands on it somehow.

Can you **buy** off of Blockchain?
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:48:56
I should have asked about purchasing power, not usd
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:28:34
What's the theoretical upper limit for these things?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:04:58
Do I need a Reddit wallet for this?
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:48:21
I understand, galactic butthole
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:25:54
Does it have any theoretical upper limit?  Is this at all possible?  If so, any estimates of how long that would take?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:45:16
One, you've hit on, yes, I believe it's going to keep going up in value.  I think, based on the history, I'll have more purchasing power in the future for having invested in bitcoin.
Also, I imagine that bitcoin will itself have more and more practical utility in the future.
Finally, I have little faith in fiat currency, namely the US Dollar.  This is to diversify for me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:28:59
Did I make a mistake buying them from them?
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:47:27
That's not what I mean though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:18:35
OK.  That's it.  I'll buy one.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:13:09
That's the thing -- you only purchase what you can afford to lose.  If this goes bust back down to $60, that sucks, but you need to be indifferent.
