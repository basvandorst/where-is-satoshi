They can print money dude, we as mere mortals can't print money to buy a new car ;) Only if we are a bank or government!

I absolutely don't like the guy, I find him way too obnoxious &amp; NPD, but I agree 100% with him. Banks are old tech, it needs to die in peace.

There is a vast difference between passionate and fanatical, that's why I structured my post like this.
Passionate means you live and breath something, some activity etc. You are spending all or a lot of your waking hours happily devoted to your activity of passion. But you're open minded. Like people passionate about i.e. a certain kind of music, the best rockers, DJs, rappers... they're open minded and listen to all kinds of music and respect the other artists.
Fanatical on the other hand means you have borders for the extend of your passion, you don't accept alternative views, you believe your source of passion is superior and there's nothing to be improved on it or learned from other fields.
Other example are soccer hooligans, who don't respect their competitors and go at extemes to discredit and even beat their favorite team competitors. That's not passion, that's fanatic.
There are certainly a lot of people in the BTC community who have firmly crossed passion and gone deep on the fanaticism spectrum. Andreas is more or less the leader ;) The guy is massively NPD anyway...

I bet this guy is wiping his ass with Bitcoin themed toilet paper! I mean, it's one thing to love, another to be obsessed, being fanatical and then comes our dear friend Andreas...

Recently Elon isn't exactly covering himself in glory... CZ - no comment!!! I love Elon and I know he's a good guy, he's not a monumental asshole like CZ or Jobs, but he needs a lengthy break to get his brain juices flowing again, otherwise he's just confirming the studies by all those neuroscientists who claim lack of sleep lowers your IQ.
Anyways, these 2 getting together is a good reason to short both Tesla &amp; BTC.

But is it supporting demo trading? I meant virtual like in demo. Not with real money.

I know, or have little control or influence. Pre-sales of ICOs are closer to what VCs do. Mentioned it as a close example, not exact.
