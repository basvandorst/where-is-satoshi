It was sarcasm.

That's a good idea, budgeting for investing. If you ear mark money to throw away, the risk seems less, and the reward is way greater!

Could one say, create such an algorithm based on data from where the market has been? 
Like, I get a downloaded copy of all the stock prices for a particular market, and play with it until I get an algorithm that works for all datasets, I'll be a millionaire investor?

I would have to be a program, probably a web app, obviously secure.

What the guy above is trying to point out is that other people have opinions that are different than yours and they are not wrong, they just have different ideas. A lambo is a useful acquisition to some people beyond flagrant display of wealth. That's their truth. Let them live it.

What about bitwage? Almost signed up but I thought about exactly this. I want to get my paycheck partly in Bitcoin!

Yeah not a prostitute. Just wanna get paid in BTC. Good advice.

+/- a few hundred doesn't mean much if/when the price goes to the thousands dollars per. Unless of course you're waiting to buy 10s of coins.

Not unless you have a dick in your ass.

I think there definitely is a place for it. But, it would be nice if the dispensary was also a crypto exchange and customers could buy Bitcoin paper tokens and then trade them for weed. 
Then they still deal with a cash issue, but not if they can incorporate the Bitcoin exchange separately and get a bank account for that. 
I think a cool model would be an app that allows customers to buy "gift cards" using credit cards or crypto. The company selling the gift cards is a separate entity and has a bank account. They handle the dispensaries gift cards transactions and the dispensary can pay them an amount equal to the salaries of the employees and the company makes no profit ever. 
Then, customers can come in and flash the QR code on the "gift card" to the cashier and the cashier will scan it and the proper amount of Bitcoin will be transferred. Or, customers who actually use bitcoin can just show their own QR codes.
