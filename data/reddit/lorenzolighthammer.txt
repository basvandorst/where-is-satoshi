the problem with making a news source is the second it becomes a meaningful channel, it becomes a meaningful channel for spreading FUD and using it for spreading fake news that profit people
the only way we keep fake news at bay is by not consolidating it, that way it has to fight with real news on a level playing field
fake news still probably wins though because it has money and agenda behind it. real news only has grassroots support :(

yeah that's normal

start it up, bro!

and it looks like a hand after you snap your fingers, how clever is that!

You think there will be no consequences?  
No price to pay?  
The bill comes due. Always!

value just means it can be exchanged for something OF value
if someone is willing to give you food for it, then it has value. it's all a psychological concept
just because something is intangible doesn't mean it's not allowed to have value, people buy and sell digital things all the time now. like weapons and armor in games 
if you're asking "why does it need to exist when we have other things that are a measure of value that do the job better?" then that's a different answer. the answer to that is, bitcoin was designed to do be better than fiat at two things, being anonymous and being out of the control of a governing power. the third thing, being easy to exchange was on the list of things it should do well but has since fallen off due to unforseen design flaws
other cryptocurrencies built on the back of bitcoin's innovation handle transactions much better
TLDR - you want money that's better at being money? this is the road towards it. bitcoin is the journey not the destination

i don't think there's a cure for this, save programming in artificial barriers to rallies and crashes which only draw out the hype curves really
the only way crypto is gonna work as a currency is if it's never used as a currency. basically when you tap your phone to pay for something using your bitcoin, instead of transfering the bitcoin to the vendor it pays out dollars from your exchange and they dock the corresponding bitcoin from your account
basically bitcoin banks, which absolutely sucks

actually the only things needed for a currency to be "believed in" are 
1. it needs to at least retain its value  
2. it needs to be easily tradeable  
3. it shouldn't be perishable
other than that everything else is up for grabs. hell even the 2nd one isn't really a problem. they had people with giant stones as money and in the end they just decided not to move them, they just made certificates of ownership and left them where they were

i'm pretty sure a lot of us "knew" the story was a load of shit the second we heard "16 yr old girl programmer"
go ahead and downvote me if you want, it doesn't change the truth. stereotypes exist for a reason. the exact same reason is what made all the believers excited for this "prodigy"
