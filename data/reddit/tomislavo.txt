People might not agree to the point he or she makes, but this is a well elaborated argument. Downvoting just because it's not a conformist opinion to what everybody else is saying on this subreddit is just intellectually ignorant and poor sportsmanship.

Of course, cause we all know how subtle he is. He's a skillful master of the fine tuned political message.

I'm not sure what the difference is between systemic and price stability according to the author. Maybe someone here can explain this. He doesn't really say what he means by "systemic instability" except connecting it to crashes. But while "crashes" have led to bankruptcies of certain banks, the system itself has remained intact, albeit with a drop of prices and valuations. So I get the impression that he conflates the two concepts of price and systemic stability which sound catchy but seem to be congruent to a good extent.
At the same time he seems to define systemic stability regarding bitcoin exclusively as security without clarifying how this is a property lacking with traditional fiat currencies to a significant extent. This seems to be even more striking given that bitcoin hasn't taken over an important part of transactional tasks yet (at least compared to the fiat currencies), and especially not in times of "systemic instability". I'm not inherently critical of cryptocurrencies but I'd appreciate if someone could flesh out how the self-correcting and self-adjusting mechanism is smart enough to for instance not accidentally act pro-cyclically in times of crises - a property which can be better controlled in a system where humans can intervene when necessary. Again, not arguing one of way or the other other, just interested in some clarification.

I think it was something like 10 mins into the game.
