Ummm she is wrong again in her writing. I have reached puberty.  About 25 years ago. That is two stories she has gotten wrong in a week. Let me do some fact checking..... before I write this... Anyone else reach puberty yet?

Love it... Make it so...

The reporter will never respond because they all do it. That is a reporters justification. Why do you think Athletes hate the media so much. It happens to them all the time.

Seems like her point misses the point? Her issue about Bitcoin is there are too many white people involved? That is the main thing she got from the film? Sounds and reads like a troll piece.

When you read the article it seems more like a Troll piece then anything else. To me Mt. Gox  is no different then Bernie Madoff.
