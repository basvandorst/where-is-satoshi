How about donating to Gaben so we can get Half Life 3
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:07:29
Easy there, this isn't a cult...
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:01:12
Gonna have to agree with this guy here.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:21:16
Sorry but it seems like he's right. You're looking to make your software into a self fulfilling predictor of the market. 
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:25:08
He's joking man, calm down.
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:04:03
People don't seem to understand that here.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:54:48
Dude lots of deluded people here, just ignore and move on, it's absolutely a crash. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:41:36
This is how you get people to stop using your services, fucking embarrassing.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:31:24
Because it's your place to live without a landlord hanging over your head or having to worry about being kicked out when they sell the house.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:38:48
It's much, much less likely to happen, get real. Getting kicked out by a landlord is a much more likely scenario than that. Also your father was paid above market value for his house, they didn't just steal his property lol.
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:40:10
That's pretty much it
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:31:08
I hope everyone she ever meets keeps reminding her, what a bullshit response to that. Only reason she's famous is because she did porn. You can't jump ahead of the fame train by being a Lebanese porn star and then demand everyone forget and never mention it then pretend that everyone should pay attention to you and respect you for your real contributions to sports commentary like you clawed your way to the top. 
No bitch, you used your body to get to where you are, no one is going to forget that.

Looks like Steve Drambis isn't into bears anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:14:14
Had you won would you have expected him to pay?
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:26:08
Honestly it's just a stupid bet that two people made on the internet, I don't think anyone would expect anyone to pay that. This whole post crying about wanting $3400 for a silly unenforceable bet is ridiculous. You admitting that you're wrong and saying you'll not pay shows more character than the OP, kudos bro.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:39:27
I haaate when idiots keep quoting Warren with regards to Bitcoin. He's super against it ffs.
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:38:25
Sounds about right
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:16:05
It's a bet you made with someone you don't know on the internet, with no legal documention, quit your crying it's kind of embarrassing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:17:26
It's a canadian bitcoin exchange which has low transaction fees, low wait times for verifications, low wait times for fund deposits and very low trading volume :/
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:00:52
Dude, there is barely any water in the pot to even make steam here, even if the electricity is cheap. Also no charts or tickers. There seems to be buyers lined up, but no motivated sellers.
I commend them on their reddit gold giveaway to drum up some interest, but they need to seriously have incentives in place to get some actual trading going on, besides the low transaction rates. Or else people are going to go to gox or virtex and you absolutely cannot blame any of us for doing so. The market is moving too fast to have any serious money locked up there gathering mold, not even generating interest.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:51:26
It's not so much that i'm trying to make it look like nothing happened, it's that i don't really give a shit. It could very well be both, who knows
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:42:41
For the exact reasons i stated. It makes me roll my eyes and cringe at your regurgitation of a completely irrelevant quote. Trees are not markets, yeesh. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:20:19
Honestly I have the same reservations, it could very well be worthless or be six figures each, who knows. ANYONE that says that it absolutely will be a big success, no ifs ands or buts is TRULY ignorant and has blinders on. All they want to see is their return on their investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:04:18
None of that shit matters if it doesn't go mainstream and become adopted by the people. You can speculate all you want and assume what banks are plotting to do, but FFS stop assuming that bitcoin is taking a one way trip to the moon.
It is very likely it will succeed, but we can't say for certain.

Vault of Satoshi
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:02:58
Insults and condescension are rife in this sub. I agree with having rational discussion about the faults of bitcoin.
Just keep asking questions, most people including Junglesumtimes have their heads SO far up their ass, they can't even see that additional taxes and fees imposed by governments to merchants ARE what will kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:33:47
HAHAHAHA you're deluding yourself if you think that most bitcoin users are not in it for the monumental growth that's expected of it.
You tell yourselves that, it's also the reason you folks are ridiculously aggressive against the bitcoin naysayers. I have no doubt that a handful of bitcoiners would absolutely KILL those that keep spouting whatever propaganda against bitcoin with the vitriol that I'm seeing here.
I personally hope bitcoin succeeds and will be used in the mainstream market, but it's not guaranteed.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:12:29
I agree, which is why there needs to be heavy incentives to even try to compete with the two titans of trade here in Canada.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:18:27
Agreed lol.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:41:26
Funny that reddit constantly promotes atheism and skepticism but just brushes all that aside when there's money to be made pumping bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:31:21
Oh i understand it perfectly well. Nothing is a guarantee, especially bitcoin. Who's to say it won't come crashing down in the future? 
That metaphor is to be used in circumstances where growth is given, without a doubt. Bitcoin does not fall into that. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:33:22
No, he's banking on the fact that bitcoin is going to keep increasing in price.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:57:18
How about when you just sell your coins on an exchange and then re-buy without receiving the cash directly? Would you need to report that as well?
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:15:04
I already have plenty of bitcoin from VoS, that's besides the point. Having btc shouldn't keep you from rational thinking. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:19:11
I'm so fucking tired of hearing this damned phrase repeated over and over again. You're not original. You're not being clever. Most of all you're not being smart.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:47:46
Because they can re-buy their coins at a lower value and have more then when they sold initially. Most people want to ride the waves.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:42:19
Wow I'm all for bitcoin, but you guys are violently defensive of bitcoin. I've noticed this trend of downvoting and abuse against any naysayers of bitcoin, or anyone that has any doubt in their mind and that it *might* not be the future currency. 
You guys need to tone it down a little bit, you've seemed to put yourselves right besides the conspiracy theorists with your attitudes. A healthy skepticism is needed for something like this, it's not a guaranteed success and the value of the coin is reliant on other peoples perceived value of it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:28:07
VoS is essentially useless right now. None of the sellers are pricing their coins to sell. They're not trading, just sitting on their coins with a ridiculously high asking price, and very low volume.
Look elsewhere and avoid using this exchange for now, I'm either going to request my money back or bite the bullet and buy up overpriced btc and move to Virtex where there is ACTUAL trading going on.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:26:46
I agree with you, I've read your other comments and feel it is incredibly convoluted dealing with the fragility of bitcoin and fucking around with firewalls, secure OS'. 
People that keep going on about "it's easy, you're a fucking idiot that needs to be killed off because you don't know about cold storage and seeded backups blah blah" have not yet grasped the fact that the majority of people are coming in without this knowledge and if they turn away because it's too complex and easy for a hacker to gain access to your coins, the mighty value of this coin will plummet to nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:26:59
My account has been pending since BTC was 450.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:49:38
Yes, but he would be getting cheap advertisement, since the number of retailers accepting bitcoin is very small
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:13:01
You're comparing the governments ability to collect taxes and track the flow of money with fucking hamburgers? Fuck off and take a step back from the bitcoin frenzy and think with your head and not your wallet, jesus the governments have done worse things then going back on a couple of lousy senate hearings. 
If they feel they're cash flow is threatened (banks included) you've gotta be nuts to think they're gonna sit back and let a bunch of neckbeards "have at it".
