I think the Bulls are gonna push past this sell wall
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:58:05
Sell wall is still there at 14k

How smart was Charlie Lee to sell all his LTC when he did?

If it is bottom let it sit a few days. This is a train bros don’t get in the way 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:54:10

Pay attention could be another bull trap here the train is still full steam ahead, don’t get rekt by it

Previously the market cap was always small. The market cap was much bigger all time highs. Good luck regaining it

To be fair a lot of analyst have been called 3800. 1200 is next on the list of the bearish sentiment continues

You really gotta trade these coins.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:21:28
Why are you guys buying putting yourself in front of this train? Let the train hit man
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:23:07
I don’t have a short. I’m out. 
But you just HODL 
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:13:27
I did months ago
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:55:02
You’re getting rekt and don’t even know it. Heh
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:34:52
It’s in free fall now
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:34:01
Cause I can re enter when I feel the opportunity to do so? It’s called trading.

I agree with almost everything you say.
Bitcoin does have properties tho, maybe not the properties of copper or precious metals or other commodities, but it has utility. I can’t use copper to send someone value across the planet free of third party institutions. Not easily any way.
I agree driving the price to 20k was FOMO which is another way of saying greed, and really what we are seeing is the air rushing from the bubble. I wouldn’t bet on 0 and I wouldn’t bet we see 15k again any time soon if ever. I’m betting we see bitcoin trade somewhere between 200-1000 depending on its use of doing all it was intended to do, move value not hold it.

Sold BCH right after Coinbase adopted it. Managed to get out at about 3400 despite the massive issues it caused. One of my best trades. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:17:47
You just got denied the yearly low resistance 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:08:47
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:20:34
