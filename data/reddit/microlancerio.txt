I'm building a LN-enabled freelancing site called [
It's been really fun so far, but LN is still quite a ways from really pushing it onto companies in general. We don't have dynamic channel backups, we don't have atomic multi-path routing, and a bunch of other things that will really make it usable for general cases.
BUT the beauty of it is that ALL SIGNS are showing it's possible. Mainnet LN is growing rapidly and it's very exciting!

My site is still new, but has a few fullstack freelance devs.
It's free to post, and is 100% Bitcoin Lightning Network based site.

[microlancer.io]( does via Lightning Network!

My Bitcoin + Lightning Network project called [Microlancer.io]( could use some development help.
Check it out @ [
There's a link to our discord at the bottom of the website. Let me know if it looks interesting or not.

Be sure to configure the folders so that the blocks are stored externally but the index is stored locally. My node was processing way too slow until I changed that. Then it became super fast.

Also check out my Lightning Network powered freelancing site!
It's still a work-in-progress, but it's functional!

I think it's notable that it gets searched a lot by people. Not as much as Bitcoin, but certainly not zero.

Thanks for posting that article! I think it's super helpful for anyone freelancing or looking to earn a bit of extra Bitcoin these days. I know my site is still new and there's not much activity, but I really wanted to build a good user experience around "instant freelancing without barriers" and Lightning Network is just perfect for that!

My platform welcomes eliminating the intermediary (us) after first contact. But hopefully becomes a great resource for people to come back for additional hires or work. It's low fee or zero fee (if it's non-escrow). Powered by Lightning Network. It's still in the beginning stages, but functional! Check it out @

Several tasks on [microlancer.io]( let you earn several thousands satoshi for quick online work.
@_date: 2019-12-12 04:27:55
Is Bitcoin Magazine considered reputable media?
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:22:04
Actually it is sorted by most recent task except that there's a feature where users can pay a few extra satoshi (boost) to be featured higher on the list for visibility.
I know there's a bunch of those featured/boosted that you're not interested in, so, I plan to add these two features:
1) Tasks expire after inactivity, including boosted ones.
2) Hide button (marks a task as hidden so you won't see it anymore in search results)
I hope this helps! I know the site is still pretty "basic" but I really put a lot of effort in making the foundation for the site decent so that I could expand it much faster.

Earn Bitcoin doing microtasks at [ \- There's no homework or tutoring posts yet, but maybe eventually people will start posting more of that kind of stuff. For now, it's mostly technical microtasks.

Post it on [microlancer.io]( and the escrow is only a 2% fee.
