Let me rephrase. We facilitate the transaction between people who want to sell gift cards for crypto and people who want to purchase stuff on amazon. We facilitate by using our fancy software to place the orders automatically for sellers. 
Why is it necessary to troll?

There is a "seller", an individual who has unwanted gift cards on his account and wants to acquire crypto.
There is a "buyer", an individual who wants to buy something on Amazon and wants to receive a discount.
We take the sellers information and fulfill the transaction once the buyer places the order.
When the buyer receives the item, we pay the seller.
Let me know if that was better clarification.

Hey, we're trying to get reputable as well. Actually we would argue our service is much better. We fulfill all the orders and discount is better.
What do you not like about the web design?

So I answered this in another thread:
We are a competitor with purse. Purse is a great services that is pushing crypto adaptation, but theres simply two major issues; timing and discounts. Purse will facilitate a transaction for a 5% discount and handle the transaction themselves. Anything above a 5% discount, and you have to wait for an earner to facilitate your transaction. This causes some issues.
It could take weeks or months to get your item delivered and Purse doesn't really get involved in the transaction. "You want an 8% discount on that new speaker? Well wait for an earner to fulfill it....."
On the other hand, we purchase the unwanted Amazon credit / gift cards from individuals who don't want them for a fixed price, and fulfill everything ourselves. We are the ones fulfilling every single transaction. With us, you get a 10% discount, delivery times as fast as ordering from Amazon, and avoidance of the hassle with dealing with the third party. This reduces problems between either sides of the transaction. Think shopping on ebay vs. fulfillment by Amazon.
TLDR; We purchase gift cards from people who do not want them in exchange for crypto.

We have a pretty sophisticated software architecture that blocks suppliers who are trying to do something nefarious. Plus all purchases are backed by our guarantee: [
Actually a large majority of our sellers are "cash paid" employees who are looking for an easy way to acquire crypto.

US only at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:33:13
Well okay then! Thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:08:11
Ha. Good point. To be honest, we're just a bunch of devs with an interesting idea, currently located in all corners of the world. We're setting that up all now. Will update everything once we have it all set up.

Yes we know about dropshippers. They love our site. This was made for regular retail customers but it can be used to drop ship as well.
@_date: 2019-04-28 05:49:06
The second hand gift card market is roughly 10B a year. Look at Raise, RetailMeNot, cardcash, cardpool, cardbazaar, GC spread plus many others.
A little education before sarcasm is always a good thing :)
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:10:48
Done. Check it out now. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2019-04-28 04:49:18
Bug. Fixing.....
Fixed :)

1. Gift card companies pay much higher for CC fees than you expect. 
2. The margins for acquisition of those gift cards from wholesale channels is high. You can look up retail sale prices by using giftcardwiki or giftcardgranny sell sections. 
3. Our business isn't just related to the gift card space. It's also related to the drop shipping space which combined with some really clever software adds to the margin. If you'd like to PM us we can discuss some strategies if you're very interested but this topic is a more on the complex side.
Try it out, buy something small, then tell us how your experience is. We promise you'll be pleasantly surprised.

It was really popular. Few hundred orders a day when we started. The issue was with Amazon. Unlike our competitors we use more "drop shipping" methods in order to ship products rather than just transaction escrow. We place the orders ourselves without any third parties. 
These retailers are much more drop ship friendly and don't have any issues with this business model.
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:41:09
Cancel and come get that extra 10% off :).
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:30:33
A group of developers got together to make a service to spread the adoption of cryptocurrency to the mainstream community. Is terminology really worth the downvote?
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:41:53
What can we do to enable a better trust when coming to our site.
@_date: 2019-04-28 05:02:54
Thanks! Let us know should you need any assistance.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:19:54
We'er looking into it. It's not easy to implement.
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:04:22
It's not an escrow site! We handle the delivers and the entire transaction without any communications to the sellers. The thing we don't like about purse is that there is an unexpected wait time for when you place your order. You have to wait for an earner to come. With us, there is no difference between placing the order with us or the retailer (since everything is done by software).
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:35:54
In all honesty, the reason we have it first on the left is because the color didn't blend as well with our background. We can change it.
Bitcoin is now first.
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:40:19
Bitcoin is now first. 
In all honesty we were only thinking of the orange color not contrasting with our design.
@_date: 2019-04-28 04:45:38
We had it. The wallet system is just such a pain to implement. Constantly breaks. Will bring it back soon.
@_date: 2019-04-28 04:55:42
We can!
@_date: 2019-04-28 04:44:52
You don't trust it because there's alt coins listed?
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:33:58
Most of us aren't in the US. So would have to figure all that out first. The system was actually designed without a wallet feature so people would only deposit what they would spend to buy things. We wouldn't want to hold people's money! 
Will get the team to add that. Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:40:48
US only. Sorry.
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:20:32
That's the idea :)
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:24:03
We'll get there one day :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:54:19
There's plenty of other services that offer retail merchandise through better adoption principles. Purse.io and [Alagoria.com]( basically introduced all retail merchandise with 10% off incentives for using crypto. 
This is just third party centralized nonsense.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:42:21
Thanks! let us know should you have any other questions.
