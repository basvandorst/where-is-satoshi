I believe the miners are the real issue. Look at the fees, in less than a year rised from less than 0.0005 BTC per KB to 0.002 BTC per KB. It is a 400% rise. The segwit sad show demontrates that miners want money and all the rest can go into the trashcan. And as most low profile merchants, look at short term profit, who cares if they can have 5000 transactions per block in a year... someone else will do the magic for them.
That 95% of consensum is madness, is the child of FOSS and free software flower-power vision. But we are speaking of money, China, hardware normal people can just dream.
TL; DR; Bitcoin project did not take into account that a time would came a user means 0 and a big greedy company means 100, so bye bye consensum.
My 2 cents!!

This is CB homepage now:
[Let's buy some BTC!](
Now, in two weeks I saw CC SVN confirmation stop working, problems with site not loading or loading slow, withdrawal system stop working. I modified an options in the settings and now I receive an SMS every time a problem arises or is solved by them.
Don't do that...
I firmly believe the company is in full respect of law, as I firmly believe that they are having too many problems arising costantly and all of a sudden.
People on forum are reporting horror stories. One is ok, five makes me rise an eyebrow, a full load makes me wonder what's going on.
Anyway, I don't want to make accusations of any kind, I just reported what everybody can see by reading their forum, reading their service status page, by receiving warning SMS (if masochist like me :).
Oh, they "forgot" to implement a call in the API, I have to stop using it. Still waiting for them to fix this one too.
So I decided not to buy my coins there, no less, no more, not a tragedy. If they will come back with a raging bull alike server farm etc. everybody will be happy, that's for sure.

Take a look at the forum, I buy from them for a year now and never a problem. Now something strange is going on. Judge by yourself, anyway I suggest you not to move too much money in their pockets, at least not now.

Nah, they are the perfect example of a company not reinvesting to improve, because last model of sportscar is too cute not to buy it.


When a new fancy motorcycle hit the market, the CEO fired the whole customer support department and started a trip on bike around the world.


They are running off with the loot, now.
I am not someone who can understand candle charts with a single look, and knows all the math needed to be able to earn enough to live just using Plus500, but to take the road to Chaper 11 when what you sell worth every day more is really something.
The real question is: which one should we choose to buy BTC now and than without fees as high as 10%...

Under attack... but from whom? When "server farms" of ASICs are needed to keep the whole thing running, I believe the "Be your bank" slogan now sounds as "Miners are your bank because you can't mine": they quit, because of a local pestilence, and my 1,000,000 $ invested in BTC simply cease to exist... am I wrong?

Please, don't be rude. My ideas about how the world should be, are not in my silly question. I just asked: in real world, uncertainity leads to stocks and currencies etc. price drops. Uncertainity here does not seem to have the same effect, since price of BTC continue to rise as if nothing changed in these months.
 I just try to understand why when a man sees an uncertain allround condition in society etc if in Wall Street, sells, if on Kraken, buys like there is no tomorrow.
If my question is idiot, I am sorry. I'll go to a library and start with Keynes and Smith and Marx and die soon after.
PS the "rotten" sentence was just a quote.

Uncertainity is a child of other actors' moves, how they can say anything really useful or concrete if no one on the planet knows anything really useful or concrete about this situation?

I see, so what I feel as a big danger for Bitcoin (miners vs Core, UASF,  twits about each other's mother habits and so on), is a small danger, or at least smaller than others, and this makes BTC a safe harbour.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:50:53
OK, thanks for your explanation!
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:01:03
Thanks for your answer, ' too. It's really a complex reality to deal with.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:54:43
Not sure? I see.
So: the "rules" in the bitcoin market are so different and new (I believe they are) that reactions of investors can't be compared 1:1 to the... old ones. 
Hope I got it right...

Ipse dixit.

The opposite, in fact my question is: where are the 'scared' ones that always play safe when things becomes uncertain, and sells?
And honestly, if these whales knows *exactly* what they are doing, "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark."
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:51:21
Maybe, but a scared investor is a scared investor, robo/actual/whatever market we speak about, I believe.

I did not mention fees, or malfunctions of any kind, I did not mention a mass attack.
I am not complaining.
I am asking to people who knows about finance more than me (my cat is one), why, if in the old school financial Gordon Gekko-Wall Street world, when political/social/economic situation is uncertain, usually this cause investors to slow down, maybe selling those 200% in one month Belize's bonds , and buy gold; while the uncertain situation of the Bitcoin (we all know everything about it) seems not to influence the value of Bitcoins == someone buy and buy and buy. 
Is not an attack to Bitcoin, or miners, or to other details of this saga, is something that seems really really odd to me.
