Raphaelle Nicolle, Jean-louis van der Valle and Giancarlo Devashni are the thieves.
Can I collect my 5% bounty if this leads to the culprits.
Also, if the theft is actually grater than $70m (i.e all the deposits), can i get 5% of it all.

who has control if the wallets?

Zane just ignores whatever he wants. I honestly think they started cashing out USD, LTC, ETH weeks ago and ran a fractional reserve.
Bitfinex stockpiled BTC  for themselves useing customer funds and customers thought they were running full reserves, because atleast the BitGo wallets made it appear that way.
They won't show any numbers (it should be easy if everything is on the block chain) and I think they will make off with everything.
Very little USD will remain in banks.

Correction - more than $70m.
Nobody's got their deposit back yet. Who's to say that we will.
36% haircut / BFX-bucks is just a red-herring

Coindesk can't reach them for comment, and you can be sure as heck they'll be avoiding the FBI.
You might discover that the only telephone number for bitfinex is their lawyers office, with is on an automatic answering machine.

Good - BitGo should have locked up the coins before now though.
They have managed to move 70k+ coins out into cold storage, after the event.
Zane won't tell us the name of the individual(s) that controls of the wallets.
Just try asking. He'll say that 


Who's "we" ? Just like you are working with "multiple authorities" in "various countries", you will never be specific by producing names &amp; numbers.
