he's lucky if his website isn't seized by the end of December. any 'exchange' still on Tether is a ticking time bomb till MTGOX repeat.

Still a reason to be concerned if you’re using binance or any other platform that uses tether as it’s stable coin. If you knew what you said above you’d come to the same conclusion.

Yes they’d be stupid not to in an unregulated market where they made those billions.  Doesn’t make the risks any less as an investor cause he’s covering his own ass. Hope the smart ass comment made you feel better.

unexplained..he missed out. he's desperate for attention and to tell people "I told you so" (2008 recession "Dr. Doom"). He didn't get the chance to make millions by investing into Bitcoin (he'd have looked like a genius if he predicted the 2008 recession AND told everyone to invest into BTC). Since he failed on the second part, he wants to be right again about Bitcoin failing like he predicted  the economy. Except he's a year late on this call. I understand if he doesn't believe in Bitcoin but the obvious anger and words he uses shows his true colors all too well. He isn't the only one to call out the 2008 recession there were handfuls of doomsday prophets warning about this - and guess what - there's millions of them every year always predicting 'the end of the world' / 'next depression' / 'next recession' - at some point someone will be right at guessing.

kiss that premium to exit out of Tether now.
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:33:25
how's that tether feelin?...
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:19:24
No one likes a sore loser buddy. I was able to trade tether when we had this argument into bitcoin then sell it back at 6900. Then you come back to call me the noob after you were wrong.

I was surprised how congress reacted to him, they could definitely see through it.

this is also June futures expiration date, the timing is impeccable -

“If they saw Bitcoin as a realistic future currency, they would be working on how to profit from it.” 
So you don’t think that’s exactly what’s happening right now? What better way to secure something they were late to than to spread FUD tank the price and gather it yourself, right before the price is suppose to get higher then it’s ever been in only 8-10 months.  Selling/giving up now is impatience X stupidity.

so..you're saying it's tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:36:52
Yes, you'll tell me I'm wrong in 1-2 years when Bitcoin crashes from 100,000 to $25,000.

I can see it getting over 20K again in the next 2 years. What I find more interesting is the amount of naysayers who come out for Bitcoin compared to pretty much any other 'bubble' or asset that has risen a lot. May I ask what it is about Bitcoin in particular that drives you to scour forums and talk badly about it. And if you are so disinterested in it, why spend time watching the price and making predictions? Typically if an asset loses interests, the people who don't believe in it do not pay attention to it, but with Bitcoin it almost seems the opposite. Are people really that desperate to say "I told you so?" - or are you watching it because the truth is your scared of the reality if you're wrong - and know you made a decision that could've changed your life drastically had you taken the risk? Just as Bitcoin holders come here to praise BTC/crypto to make them feel better about their investment, doubters come here to FUD to help them cope with the opportunity they did not take.

I don’t think it needs to “replace the system” to reach higher than 20k. Whether it does or not I have no stance on. Looking at other “bubbles” in history they don’t keep forming higher and higher “bubbles” and “deaths” as time goes.  The only “bubble” scenario bitcoin is following is the dot com bubble - and none of those stocks ever got past their 1999-2001 “bubble highs” .. oh wait ..
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:01:42
If one of the reasons it’s rising is the anticipation of ETFs being approved - I think it’s somewhat the opposite, no?
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:27:17
thanks for sharing the same news from 2014...sheesh.
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:02:56
It’s literally in your title. “Has remained”. If all alt coins are PoW still what is the point of this statement?
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:39:38
proof of stake is still just a concept - MOST "alt" coins are still running off a PoW system, so your point is kinda...false. (maybe 1-2 years+ when a lot of alts are running alternatives to PoW, and BTC is still  you could make this argument, but as it stands right now it makes very little sense).
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:51:52
And how many of those are currently running a full PoS without PoW? And what is the age comparison of bitcoin to these PoS coins ? Most have been out for what ..let’s say 1-2 years? And what has happened to bitcoins market cap dominance in that timeframe ? About halved right?

I don't think people get what you did here, bravo.

I thought this was a meme lol, thank God the combined 10 people in those countries can now buy crypto on Coinbase! this doesn't qualify as an announcement.
