When you sold your Bitcoin, someone else bought Bitcoin.

Pure conjuration, allegation and hearsay. Do you have any proof to back that up? Or will you rely on baseless claims as you expect us to rely on baseless claims on your argument?

Your above quote "Brian Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase) is an avid supporter of many scaling proposals that are not named SegWit" Is simply untrue. I think you will find that handed your glutinus maximus to you. How do you plead?

These BU people should just fork right now if they so badly want to leave and believe their solution to the scaling/latency problem is superior, hell, make the blocksize 1TB. Just release a new BU client and point your nodes and miners to it. But no, doing that would be too difficult. **You want control of the Bitcoin network**

I witnessed a Bitcoin Unlimited coding team that lacks the experience. They've never scaled a coin of this size before. Its like asking a novice to perform brain surgery.
Please show me ANYTHING noteworthy any of their devs have done. They simply lack the experience:
If I was looking to hire a coding team to maintain the largest supercomputer on Earth, and the biggest Cryptocurrency, I'd find more capable individuals with a longer resume.

Look at the Bitcoin Unlimited Commit log :/
**What this really is, is a network takeover**
