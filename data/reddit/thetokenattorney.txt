Totally agree. It's all relative to the long term perspective

He's probably buying the dip

It was undervalued at 18k too. Doesn't mean it was a good time to buy.

Aside from describing the basics of how bitcoin and blockchain technology work, I'd talk about how crypto can be stored and transferred between person, the features of a public blockchain and Bitcoin vs. a privacy coin like monero, and throw in some juicy scam stories to keep attention. Once they understand the basics, they can understand how people can be taken advantage of in different ways. Here's a link to an article about phone scams: [ (Hard to believe people savvy enough to own bitcoin are getting phone scammed, but I guess it's happening.)
I would also try to dispel the likely objections that Bitcoin and crypto is a tool primarily used by criminals.
It's easy to go down a rabbit hole. After speaking in front of groups about crypto and blockchain for a while, I've learned that you need to get good at reading your audience because everyone is starting at a different baseline. Intro questions are very helpful to establish everyone's depth of knowledge.

Basically, a smaller division of the SEC was tasked with deciding whether Bitcoin ETFs should be approved and it said no. Then the SEC head honchos stepped in and pressed pause on that decision and said hold on we need to review your work. 
Now the SEC is requesting comments from the public and asking, do you all agree with what these people applying for the Bitcoin ETF are saying? Is it true? Is it false? do you have any issues with what's being said? 
Now people are commenting to help the SEC gauge public opinion and sentiment (thats not to say that if everyone comments "we want Bitcoin ETFs" the SEC will say "okay". They can always reject.)
That's the process of what's happening.
 The main point of the post was to discuss the primary concern of the SEC - aka market manipulation - and how the latest arguments by the proponents of Bitcoin ETFs may be persuasive enough to provoke a different decision.
I hope that helps.

I have to disagree with the quote in here that says people are hesitant to trade BTC futures because the tax consequences are unknown. The consequences are pretty straightforward. 
In the United States, futures contracts are subject to the 60/40 rule. This advantageous tax treatment also applies to day trades and is broken down into two parts:
60% profits – taxed as long-term capital gains
40% profits – taxed as short-term capital gains
So I don't think that's a reason for a lack of volume.
