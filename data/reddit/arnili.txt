some node owners (like me) make it known through rdns:
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:19:02
nothing on there :-(
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:16:17
connected to you to pump you some blockchain ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:32:58
So you're in the top 50?
Where is the problem? Whats to improve?
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:53:13
you can have as many inputs and outputs in one transaction as you want, as long as the totals "add up"
so yes, you can send to countless different adresses in just one transaction
@_date: 2015-06-25 12:14:52
nice paywall
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:39:31
for real long term storage i am personally more afraid of me forgetting the password than someone gaining physical access to my private keys
this is why my "last resort" paperwallets are only protected by physical means
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:19:43
antifunny too
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:15:23
who has that much on a single address ...
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:15:22
they should show a disclaimer that a lot of their info is not very accurate :p
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:42:48
bitcoin core supports upnp by default (and enabled by default)
unfortunately your router doesnt seem to support it if you still have problems
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:03:01
takes me 2.7 seconds on a single core
ofc you're still correct that its very expensive, but not impossible
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:31:28
op is either rich, naive or the private key was not generated the way he sais it was
(There are multiple coins on that address)
6-8 chars is clearly bruteforceable
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:05:55
huge anticlimax?
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:31:46
It costs money (the mining fee) to store stuff on the blockchain, if you pay it - you can use it, if you don't - you can't.
Wo is anyone to say what you can or can not save on the blockchain as long as you pay the fee?
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:46:04
fine with me if you're willing to give them away ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-17 10:36:17


what a beauty she is ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-11 10:57:46
$89 for the cheapest "budget" server is not what i consider "budget"
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:34:12
when to buy?
how to buy?
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:19:09
During the stress testing in the last weeks people kept refering and quoting values from 
Unfortunately these values are completely off the real size of the mempool
Thats the most prominent for now ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:55:52
maybe the bots are just self-reinforcing each other that the market has turned around ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:49:34
its a pain to get fiat to or from btc-e; btc-e is a huge cryptocoin botfest
nothing unexpected and/or problematic here
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:45:08
because miners are chinese entrepreneurs who are in it for the money, not for idealistic reasons or reddit chitchat
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:42:59
that looks more like it - thanks
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:59:13
follow the money trail here
bitcoin miners don't run their expensive operations because they just like to have a lot of power
they mine in the belief that someone will accept their 25BTC block reward as money - this is only true as long as the majority of the network will actually accept their block
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:20:17
Thats 01:00 CEST on a Friday (Saturday night)
Not great imheo (In my humble European opinion)
@_date: 2015-05-17 16:09:46
which miner wouldnt be in it for the money?
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:04:50
from what i've seen on the other thread, what blockchain.info shows seems plain wrong
its more like 26.000 unconfirmed at this moment
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:04:02
its definitely not and the wallet isn't active either
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:47:53
root bitcoin-cli getnettotals
    "totalbytesrecv" : 36991359219,
    "totalbytessent" : 681009905841,
    "timemillis" : 1431092735487
Happy to serve :-)
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:06:56
I just copied the whole line - you are correct "timemillis" is very useless, it just shows my current system time
What it does show:
* I've sent 634GB of data to the bitcoin network since start
* I've sent more than 18 times more data to the network than I have "consumed" showing that i'm actually contributing a substantial share
More info FYI:
* The node had been running around 6 weeks since last restart due to the last stable update
* I maintain between 110 and 160 connections (with a cap at 500)
* Node is reachable through a fully static ipv4 as well as ipv6
But the main and most blunt reason why I posted was simply to say "i'm on and i'm running a full node"
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:16:33
everyone can get that view by beeing a fullnode ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-10 12:27:54
The answer is:
Yes you should get a full node.
All other considerations are not remotely relevant at this point.
@_date: 2015-05-30 10:54:57
nice to know that these &lt;~750KB blocks are not arbitrary after all, but seem to be bitcoin mining default
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:18:49
anyone with the required technical knowledge can just pick up a raspi, stick a 64GB SD card in it and stop crying already
whats actually happening looks more like "don't care"
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:06:06
you sir have understood the real reasons behind running a full-node
just as everyone invested in bitcoin should have
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:24:51
You can attack the network all you want, you can only influence the order of transactions on the blockchain, never the actual transactions themselves (without owning the private key).
The article suggests that someone with 51% (or 30%) can just fill the blocks with whatever he wants. This is absolutely not the case, a block will always consist of valid cryptographically signed transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:27:02
blockchain.info is around 3900 unconfirmed now (  )
can someone explain this to me though:
me bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo {"size" : 17758, "bytes" : 5988645}
my node claims that it knows about 17758 unconfirmed? transactions (i can even show txid's for those)
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:27:35
Sounds like something the losing side of the split would say.
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:31:07
The most interesting thing beeing that it wont be spawned out of thin air using a fractional reserve scheme.
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:17:52
Anybody running a recent, zero trust client was never subject to any problems whatsoever.
My node rejected that bullshit block when it first apeared and that was the end of it, they might as well have sent me a dogecoin block and claimed it was valid.
All problems we have seen today arose when people trusted others to validate blocks for them.
All people having problems trusted the wrong people.
Thats not a bitcoin problem, thats a people problem.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:47:57
If you run a node, please upgrade:
@_date: 2015-07-04 12:58:02
If they want to afford mining invalid blocks, let them.
That doesn't mean the network will reward them for it (in the long run) (by orphaning the blocks)
As soon as it becomes a problem to the network, it will become a problem to them - moneywise.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:41:31
Just do understand this properly:
Why does a full node that is not generating use the mempool for?
Only to check whats been broadcast before?
@_date: 2015-07-02 09:04:05
How is such a leech any good for the network?
How would it matter if it got dos'ed (if thats possible at all without listening)?
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:17:47
Is there a service that does exactly the opposite?
I'd like to put a bitcoin address into the reference of my sepa payment and get bitcoins (at a reasonable rate) without having to bother with a full blown exchange.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:20:23
there was no incident, the blockchain worked as intended
@_date: 2016-09-20 19:37:48
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:47:42
Unfortunately bitcoin fees are on the rise :-/
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:11:51
if banks start forbidding it, its most probably worth doing ;-)
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:30:15
even today most bitcoin nodes will require a minimum fee bound to a transaction to relay it without throttling/delays
very small transactions (which would have even smaller fees) will simply we relayed very very slowly and may take weeks or even forever to get mined into a block
so bitcoin has a simple tuning mechanism against this type of "attack"
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:24:34
This is wrong, because this failsafe only bypasses the maximum blocksize preference.
Blocks are still *fully* validated.
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:09:15
i'm running a node with quite a lot of connections (200+) and i'm currently pumping around 75GB per day
this is not an issue for me yet, but seeing this value increase more and more leaves me worried for the first time
