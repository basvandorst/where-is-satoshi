Lol. Just a few weeks ago, bitcoin maximalists like you were detesting the value of smart contracts without understanding what they were. I see you learned something. Rootstock is cool but it will by no means be the platform for ALL successful projects. That's an easy bet. There's room for many chains and interoperability. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional. Take time to educate yourself on developments outside of Bitcoin. Full disclosure: I'm an early adopter and hold both Bitcoin and Ether.

You must be new. Why don't people know that Bitcoin is also mutable? Educate yourselves.

Yeah, it's quite a bummer
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:30:32
That sucks
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:28:07
I'm sorry that happened to you. Hopefully they can make this right.

What I wonder about is if anyone's order ever gets cancelled after a decrease in BTC value due to "high risk"
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:55:15
yup. they straight cancelled the order last minute.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:51:06
Sorry that happened to you.

Actually, i didn't read the other stories until this happened to me. This was completely beyond me when I made my purchase up until I read that dreadful email. Don't click on posts that you think you'll find annoying.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:30:38
Yeah, this was my first BTC purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:39:00
hindsight.. I still have some hope that they are a legitimate business that will made things right.

Yeah, it's just frustrating that I could have gone to a different servicer and probably not had this issue. Wish they would have held my order instead of cancelling it, or told me that I was high risk the moment I put in the order instead of waiting till the last hour.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:24:55
I have the exact same issue, but with 5 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:19:25
Yeah, they seem to do that a lot
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:32:13
I can tell you that this is very real, and that I'm not a scammer. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:45:30
I can believe that. But I still think they shouldn't just cancel orders. Rather, they should hold questionable transactions until they can be unflagged via whatever process they use, whilst giving the user the option to cancel their order at that point.

Good job or you got lucky. Either way, Coinbase should not allow users to make "purchase orders" if not being verified will cause orders to be cancelled. This is extremely confusing to customers.
