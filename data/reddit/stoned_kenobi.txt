been using Commonwealth Bank for over 18 months BTC trading with money going in and out and have never had a problem
@_date: 2013-02-26 09:09:34
is there another option? is any one else doing affordable mining rigs like the jalepeno
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:44:34
i have used coinjar a few times now with no issues. just a bit slow compared to bitinovate
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:45:05
setup a new mining rig this week, go the exact same error..
did a win7  re install and downgraded my catalyst drivers from 13.? to 12.1, did that and everything worked fine.

someone dumping a shitload of BTC can drop the market considerable. It only takes a dump of 20,000+ BTC to see a -5% market drop.
in the other direction i have seen a few $1.2 Million USD buys hit mt gox over the last week and they certainly are pushing up the prices.

Fiat currency schemes are philosophically misguided, fundamentally immoral and ultimately unstable. Fiat currencies are premised on value subjectivism and erroneously conflate money and value. They represent a mere medium of exchange and rely on unstable subjective mental states such as confidence and trust. As a result, they are ultimately fragile and prone to fail suddenly when those using them wake from the dream of value subjectivism.
lets look at the specifics as to why FIAT is broken.
1. Coercion – Coercion characterizes fiat currencies because most people would not accept them unless forced to do so against their will. In the United States, for example, the replacement of gold-backed money in 1933 required the use of legal force (criminal penalties of $10,000, ten years in prison, or both) to compel U.S. citizens to accept irredeemable Federal Reserve Notes in place of gold certificates.
2. Rent Seeking – Fiat currency schemes extract economic rents by forcing commerce to take place in the fiat currency system. Since human beings trade with one another to survive, the ability to freely exchange value for value is a natural right having the same moral foundation as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  In a marketplace based on voluntary arrangements, there is no middleman extracting an economic rent in exchange for permission to participate in commerce.
3. Immorality – Fiat currency schemes are immoral because the primary thing that makes them acceptable is coercion. Forcing people to accept artificial money that has no objective value against their will and self interest is an immoral act. Additionally, fiat currency schemes allow those who control the currency to redistribute wealth by altering the availability, quantity and distribution of the currency, which is little more than legalized theft.
4. Central Planning – Since fiat currencies are based on coercive, rather than voluntary market relationships, a central authority is required that has the power to eliminate competing currencies, i.e., to establish a monopoly. Central economic planning is not only anti-democratic and the antithesis of a free market, but also inevitably fails. 
5. Price Instability – Fiat currencies, because they require relatively insignificant physical economic inputs, have no direct relationship to the survival requirements of human life. Since it is decided by central planners, the quantity of currency in a fiat currency scheme is always and inevitably incorrect. This causes price instability and artificially stimulates or depresses economic activity as a function of how much currency is produced and of how it is distributed. As a practical matter, price stability can never be achieved in a fiat currency scheme.
6. Economic Volatility – Since fiat currencies are loosely coupled to physical economic activity in the objective world, they tend to become increasingly de-coupled and eventually “un-tethered” over time. An economy is the aggregate of millions of independent, individual human actors and there is no way that those responsible for a fiat currency can guess the correct quantity, although they can recognize incorrect quantities after the fact by their consequences, e.g., credit booms, recessions, large-scale price bubbles and economic collapses, such as the Great Depression, which began only sixteen years after the U.S. Federal Reserve was established. 
7. Currency Debasement – Voltaire famously wrote that “Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value—zero.” Fiat currencies issued by governments or central banks represent intangible, subjective concepts of value like “full faith and credit” but the currency itself has no lasting value. Specifically, fiat currencies have a built-in tendency to decline in purchasing power over time as more currency is produced, particularly in fractional reserve and debt-based fiat currency schemes. In debt-based fiat currency schemes, the currency must be constantly inflated or a deflationary vicious circle (a collapse of debt) will set in. Those responsible for the currency predictably produce more than is necessary to maintain stable prices or to sustain stable economic activity, e.g., to diminish the risk of deflation, for political promises and favors, to wage war, etc. Price instability and economic volatility are the result.
8. Wealth Redistribution – Arbitrarily increasing the quantity of currency in an economy distorts the distribution of money and, therefore, redistributes purchasing power, effectively stealing wealth from the majority, e.g., savers and wage workers, to serve the interests of a privileged minority.  Redistribution of wealth, as opposed to production of wealth, causes a net loss of wealth to society. Government deficit spending, although it may be motivated by good intentions, changes the quantity of currency and results in currency debasement. 
9. Concentration of Wealth – Over time, fiat currency schemes cause wealth and property to accrue to those who enjoy the extraordinary privilege of creating the currency, thus increasing the concentration of wealth in society. Extreme concentration of wealth is economically and ultimately politically destabilizing. An individual with a one million dollar income, for example, will not buy as many consumer products, cars or appliances as ten households with incomes of one hundred thousand dollars. 
10. Moral Hazard – Baron Acton observed in 1887 that “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Since fiat currencies are created by monetary monopolies ex nihilo, e.g., through loan contracts, they provide a legal means of obtaining something for virtually nothing. As a result, those responsible for fiat currencies enjoy almost unlimited influence over economic and, therefore, political life. Sadly, human beings can never be good stewards of a currency system that provides one group in society with the means to obtain something for nothing. In fact, societies dominated by immoral fiat currency schemes eventually develop a something-for-nothing culture; a culture of entitlement in which, rather than producing wealth, everyone endeavors to live at the expense of everyone else.
11. Corruption and Cronyism – As a consequence of moral hazard, fiat currencies tend to encourage cronyism and corruption and ultimately produce a culture of corruption. The Roman poet Juvenal wrote “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” (“Who will guard the guards themselves?”). History is replete with the horrors of absolute power and with monetary abuses resulting in economic collapse. Just as democide has been a leading cause of death in the last one hundred years, fiat currencies have been a leading cause of poverty. Fiat currency schemes redistribute and concentrate wealth, resulting in a tiny and exceedingly wealthy minority, but they do not produce wealth.
12. Confidence Failure – Since the value of fiat currencies is essentially subjective, maintaining the perception of “value” in the face of economic decline and despite rising prices can be challenging. Fiat currencies are ultimately dependent on confidence and trust in those responsible for the currency. When fiat currencies are abused, confidence fails and they revert to their intrinsic value (zero). Thus, monetary policy in a fiat currency scheme focuses directly on maintaining confidence. Behavioral economics, for example, has become a primary tool of monetary and economic policy implementation. As a consequence, economic reporting by governments and central banks, and by the news media, does not reflect an objective viewpoint. Management of perception has the effect of influencing the subjective mental states of those who use a particular fiat currency so as to maintain the perception of “value”. However, in the best case, perception management is one-sided “spin”, and, in the worst case, it is propaganda that is contrary to fact and that simply prevents ordinary people from recognizing the steps they need to take in order to protect their financial interests against currency debasement and other risks associated with fiat currencies. Nonetheless, cognitive dissonance (a psychological tension between conflicting cognitions) can result in the sudden collapse of fiat currencies when economic conditions deteriorate sufficiently or when prices rise too quickly, i.e., the spell of value subjectivism is broken.
13. Counterparty Risk – The “value” of fiat currencies requires trust in counterparties, but trust, like confidence, is an ephemeral, subjective mental state. In the objective world, agreements between governments and central banks and those who rely on their fiat currency schemes can be arbitrarily modified or broken. In fact, they are implicitly broken whenever a currency is debased. The promises of deposed governments and failed banks become instantly worthless.
14. Transaction Settlement – A transaction in commodity money is a direct exchange of value for value. When a fiat currency transaction is performed, one party holds fiat currency and the other is the recipient of goods or services, but, like a retroactive breach of contract, the value of the fiat currency can be changed and may even become zero. Since there is always a residual third party to the transaction, i.e., a government or central bank, transactions remain unsettled.

did you use CCC to remove the previous drivers?
@_date: 2013-04-27 11:37:22
you are looking at it wrong...the tax you are currently forced to pay is on the FIAT currency of the government in question. 
if i was payed in FIAT dollars (US, YEN, EURO, AUD, etc), then i would be happy to pay tax on it.
people have to stop looking at bitcoin and bitcoin transactions as a standard currency, it is different. It is the future of currency, a future where governments can not make money off us. 
I am sure they will work this out, especially with the FIAT systems around the world going into overdrive, before the final crash.

not a stupid panic post, i have used coinjar a few times and on other occasions i have had a quick turn around (under 6 hours), but when stuff starts to blow out to 3 days then they should at least have the decency to update purchasers on the huge delays.
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:14:00
here you go, so you dont have to click on a link to a shitty site.........10 points thought up by someone with NO IDEA about the bitcoin community
1. No one knows who invented BitCoin except those in the CIA, NSA and related organisations making it really opaque and therefore dodgy.
2. Nothing except drugs and extreme porn seem to be traded using BitCoin, why?
3. Online poker was an option for its use until it was attacked, why would a poker site using virtual currency be attacked?
4. BitCoin is virtual and other currency can be created ad infinitum, this means that the inventors with the best branding will make the most money. BitCoin brand may have lost its lustre and another brand will take its place.
5. Maths on paper is a great way of running an economy, however, humans are not rational and therefore maths is an hindrance and religion is so popular. Therefore the virtual currency will need be be ‘believed’ before it will make head way into society.
6. Since BitCoin has no central regulatory body therefore it has no tanks or war planes therefore it will never replace the Dollar, Euro, Yuan, Yen,  or even the Pound.
7. There is a belief that BitCoin is part of some right wing conspiracy to bring back the gold standard, we will see in the fullness of time.
8. BitCoin is not part of polite conversation as of yet, making it untouchable in normal poker table banter which is the standard set to see if something has gained traction in society. I therefore assume that over 99% of the population has not heard of BitCoin and could not care less about it.
9. Any persuasive chatter about BitCoin seem to come from Max Keiser who is downright clever but a bit weird, and, will therefore scare the bejesus out of housewives and pensioners.
10. Bitcoin resembles Linden Dollar far too much, and, we all know what a pile of rubbish that was. The pound maybe be doomed but at least it has the illusion of being sensible. Linden Dollar always looked ropey.

so what you are saying is to continue to use the broken FIAT system, maybe just keep printing money and lying to everyone about the value of it?
