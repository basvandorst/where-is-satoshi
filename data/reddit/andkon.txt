It's how they get *anything* done though. Don't want to buy the pension plan they provide? Go directly to prison.


That's a bit vague. When can I expect "Wal-Mart, General Motors, or Verizon" to put me in prison if I don't buy from them?

Regulation provided by whom? What happens to those who wish to opt-out of regulation that you favor?

This is what the state does now because they have less limits on spending. They can tax, they can borrow, they can print. A private company like Wal-Mart is hugely limited by its low profit margins, about 3% for Wal-Mart. Wars are amazingly costly. Take Iraq, trillions of dollars! How is a private company going to raise that amount, knowing it has to recoup the cost? It can't. So no war.
Only when people are indoctrinated into believing in the legitimacy of the state can so much money be stolen from them through forced taxation. Wars are largely impossible due to the practical costs in a free society where people realize taxation is wrong.


Do they beat them? What is so terrible?


So we should ban blood diamonds? Restricting supply and demand... so just like the failed war on drugs? Increasing the profits of warlords does not seem like a good plan.

That's the correct answer.

Sure, I can also leave a neighborhood inhabited by a gang. Their ability to compel me to leave does not justify their thuggery though, unless your starting point is might makes right.


Yes, gangs and thieves like to be in large crowds where wealth is abundant.


Businesses will follow laws because if they don't, customers go elsewhere. Face it, the difference between Wal-Mart and the government is that only the latter can throw you in prison if you don't want to buy their stuff.

That's slander and you're giving them too much credit. Organized crime can supply alcohol and drugs and hookers. Disorganized crime provides massive wars and ghettos and illiterate fat children.

Where is your evidence that Wal-Mart uses stolen materials?


We know this? Plenty of high-end retailers. Do you buy cheap crap that only lasts a week?


Can you give an example?

How can corps manipulate without a state? You simply don't pay them and they go away. You do that to the state and you go to prison.

Monopolies have no incentive to provide good services. These services are provided via monopolies today. Ergo, a competitive system will provide better service. So:
- Police have no incentive to reduce crime because if they don't customers can't pick another company.
- Courts have no incentive to return quick verdicts (very helpful to businesses!) or reduce costs overall to both parties because you can't pick another company.
- Welfare agencies have no incentive to actually help people, instead of trapping them in poverty. People would NOT pay for voluntary charities that created crappy ghettos.

Exactly. When have any of these "states" put anyone in prison for not paying for their services or products?
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:06:48
Me having the choice to NOT pay for a service is not another state. It's the difference between forced marriage and letting the partners voluntarily pick each other.

You didn't say anything here.

That's like saying we should also arrest and convict Al Gore because he invented the Internet on which the SR relied.

Why should I pay for the services I have not received though?

Can McDonald's mandate that I pay for hamburgers I don't want? If you want government schools/research/trash pickup, pay for it. Why should I have to pay for services I don't use though?
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:24:39


And I will pay for what I use. I don't want government pensions though. Why am I obligated to pay for this service then?

The same liberalism that shut down Liberty Reserve two months ago? Or the one that's cracking down on "unlicensed" bitcoin exchanges?

If ancaps were the only group who unequivocally supported guns, it would be rather odd to explicitly remove them.

When government wants to regulate bitcoin, the topic is not free of politics to begin with. So why throw overboard the only ideologies that don't want to regulate bitcoin?
It's like not wanting to link to because might get upset.

I'll pay for what I use but why should it be a crime for me to not pay for other people's stuff?
