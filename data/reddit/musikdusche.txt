Why not something like this?

what about "mibits"?
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:54:49
Thanks for the quick response! I just had a look at onename but as i understand it, it just uses one BTC-Address for payouts. So the third problem I mentioned above is not solved. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:41:11
How can big corporations like SecondMarket "play the market"? If I'd want to buy a lot of BTC, I'd try to keep the price cheap: So buying 100000 BTC on one day wouldn't be a good idea. But apart from time-spreading and exchange-spreading the purchases, what other possibilities are there to keep the price low?

Is it possible for him to destroy his BTC in a *verifiable* way? Like sending them to an address which "has no" private key? Maybe there is one such special address defined in the protocol?

Is there a (web)service which alerts me (by email for example), if the BTC-price falls below / raises above x USD?
@_date: 2014-07-02 09:04:46
This would affect the price for some time. But bitcoin as a whole? I don't think so.
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:53:16
This is not an answer. In most countries, having some special data on your harddrive (cp or something), is illegal. Period. And in the case of the blockchain, a fullnode-operator (in contrast to a "webserver-log-maintainer") couldn't even deny the knowledge of such data on his harddrive.
If some troll with enough money knew that you had a copy of the blockchain on your hd, he might successfully sue you.

Good Points. I'm not sure though if a FUD-Strategy couldn't backfire and harm the public image of the corporation. Of course one would use intermediate PR-Agencies... but still...

On the other hand, if bitcoin manages to get into b2b-payments slowly, the market cap and liquidity will rise. But I agree, we're not there yet.

TL;DR: Is it possible to have something like a bitcoin-account-number that never changes?
Long question: If you are someone who wants to receive money its often convenient to just hand out your account details which you can often recite by heart. The payer can then just pay his/her debt later to your account. (At least in Germany it works well this way)
If I want to get paid in BTC afaik I only have the possibility to hand out a public address which the payer can use then. There are several pitfalls to consider though:
* A public BTC-Address is difficult to memorize
* Reusing a public address for receiving payments is not encouraged because of privacy-concerns
* "Partly emptying the BTC from a private key" is strongly discouraged because of security-concerns
So I wonder if it is possible to set up something like a "bitcoin-account-number" which never changes and which you can hand out to everyone you want while none of the problems mentioned above arise. Is there a BIP or something for that?
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:14:51
Sorry, English is not my native language. But I think the point (you might get in trouble with the law) is clear, isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:04:03
I'd say, bitcoins are still highly user-unfriendly.
I'm still dreaming of "physical bitcoins" my grandma could use. Like a scratchcard with a hidden private key, issued by a trusted party. In a supermarket you'd pay with it like dollar-bills, but if you want to make a transaction, you'd extract the private key.

When my mother uses bitcoin without her even knowing that she's using it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:02:06


No, it's coming back to easy methods everyone can understand. Bitcoin however isn't understandable by the average person right now. (Not, if you need to have knowledge about keys, wallets etc.)
This problem might be solved to some extend by trusted parties - but it doesn't necessarily needs to. Unfortunately, I do not have a trustless solution for the usability problem.

What is the most foolproof way for importing privkeys from paperwallets (bitcoinqt via internal console did not work very userfriendly for me...(It took about 10 Minutes or more for bitcoin-qt to import the key. Why?!?))
@_date: 2014-04-30 11:45:04
I love that they didn't mention mining. Mining is imho a bit confusing for beginners, as mining gets more and more professional. If you'd explain "Gold as money" to someone, you wouldn't focus on how to extract this funny metal from earth.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but: This is a list of entities which didn't express explicit support for segwit2x, right? *(see also footnote)* I tried to google some official statements of some of the first listed companies to find an explicit "We won't run segwit2x". But I found none. If I had a business, I would as well be very cautious: Wait and see instead of saying "I will definitely run Segwit2x" or "I definitely won't run Segwit2x". 
A helpful list would be a comparison of entities **explicitly** supporting or rejecting Segwit2x (with sources).
*footnote: I am sure that there are actually entities on the list explicitly rejecting Segwit2x. But it's unclear for me which ones.*


I know that you have a different view on that matter: Putting the word "developers" in quotation marks is already telling.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:28:36


I'm not going to argue with someone who seems to have a viewpoint based on ideology. Every other reader is free to form his/her own view on the matter.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:57:08
Dear Readers, don't be fooled:
The decision to remove jgarzik is not a technical one ("hasn't contributed the last two years"), it's a political one ("in light of his continued reckless and dishonest behavior", see [here]
(  ). Looks like certain players are creating an echo chamber. It's all a fight for interpretive dominance.
In other words: Bitcoin development is getting centralized.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:23:10
Sorry, but the group rejecting Segwit2x according to your link are mostly Core Developers:
First: There are different groups in the whole bitcoin-sphere: Miners, Exchanges, other Businesses, Developers, Users and Hodlers etc.. Your link says, that ONE of this group is against Segwit2x (while other groups clearly aren't!).
Second: I have a feeling (you are free to have a different one) that many people of the aforementioned groups don't think, that "Developers reject Segwit2x" but that it's in fact the other way round: Those who oppose the Core Roadmap were alienated from being a bitcoin Developer. Hence the information you cited is prone to selection bias.
To put it short: The things are not as clear as you want them to be.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:47:25


If Bitcoin isn't idiot-proof or villain-proof, then maybe bitcoin is a failed experiment. I don't think like this, though.
Imho it's like this: The core-developers make "proposals" by releasing new features and the community (users and miners alike) accepts or rejects them.
Like it or not: The segwit-"proposal" has not been very convincing to the community at whole. So what's really needed is that core understands this and doesn't keep riding a dead horse.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:55:43
Imho it's all a tradeoff between convenience (ease of use) and security.
In most cases things are secure enough if you use clients like electrum to move your Bitcoins. But there are cases (if you run a business for example) when you need the additional security from running a full node. But this involves more cost: Time, money, hardware, electricity ....


You are always *allowed* to run your own node. He's only saying, that not *every* user should have to.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:48:59
What's your proposal then? Proof of CoreDevs? All this twisting of the fundamentals is getting ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:17:29
ASIC-Mining != One Miner left.
Fighting Mining centralisation doesn't equal "Kill all the ASICs!!"
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:16:48


That's exactly right.


I beg to differ: It's true that you can't just change your mind on certain features every 5 minutes. But it is clear that SegWit (current proposal) is a dead end.


Unfortunately it is. That's why a more balanced proposal is needed.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:41:24
I am not sure how exactly a balance between miners, nodes and devs should look. Even if one thinks "For too long we have been catering to miners" the current situation is far too serious to continue the core-roadmap and accept a deadlock here.
The devs CAN make a change. Now. You can try to get the balance right later.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:52:57
You are free to create your ASIC-resistant Coin. The Bitcoin I signed up to was designed by Satoshi in a certain way. Even if I see problems with mining centralisation, turning Bitcoin into a different coin is not something i condone.

The signalling period ends in November 2017, right? This is late!
Apart from that: Even 75% is not very likely to be achieved considering the current state of things.

Unfortunately I don't know all technical details, but afaik even some devs have issues with UASF, right?
I am by far not sure if UASF will get widespread support.

I once imported a paperwallet into my bitcoin-qt client. Apart from being somewhat unintuitive (command-line-magic) it worked. I wondered, why it took so long (more than 10 minutes) to import it.... does the client have to scan through the whole local 11GB-Blockchain to determine the amount of BTC bbehind that address?
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:33:01


I have to agree that this is a strange idea for a decentralized system (I'm not sure though how "popular" this opinion really is....). But....


You might call me a brainwashed troll, but I do not have the impression, that the current development-model is a "design by committee". The problems we face today could have been easily solved already years ago. But for some reason (about which we could speculate for hours) the dev-team has a strangely coherent view on how not to scale bitcoin, while several key actors (exchanges, miners) are just scratching their heads.
I'm not comfortable with a dev-team, where one of the most important person has the opinion, that....

You should learn that the Bitcoin protocol might be just as tamper-proof as the titanic was unsinkable.

Pleeeease report, if Dads Bitcoins get stolen. (I'm not the type of guy who steals things. But I played around with "contrast" and "gamma value" in irfan view and some part of the private key gets readable. Maybe you'll try it yourself)
@_date: 2013-09-29 09:19:50
My method for creating brainwallets (please comment):
Pick sentences from your favourite childrens book or from your favourite poems, lets say:
Quoth the **raven**, “**Nevermore**.” 
Bob the **builder**: Can we **fix** it? Yes **we** can
... and so forth.
The above (incomplete) method yields the passphrase
You now can write on a piece of paper as your memorizing-aid:
Quoth the -, “-.” 
Bob the -: Can we - it? Yes - can
To apply this method correctly, you obviously shouldnt choose phrases like those above as they are too easy. Anyone knows them. But when I flip the pages of my favourite childrens books I always stumble upon everyday-sentences, that have no importance to anyone but me: For me they were (for whatever reason) highly memorable.
Advantages of this method:
You can write down the sentences, by replacing the relevant passphrase-words with a dash. Ideally not even your close family members are capable of filling these dashes with the right words. So you can write down these clozes, which is for you like a perfect reminder, but useless for anyone else.
You can produce very lenghty passphrases you do not need to memorize, as you can write them down without giving too many hints to others (ideally)
Close to random choose of words, but not perfectly random.

I actually upvoted this posting! Just to remind myself how silly it is to extrapolate the bitcoin-price.
Edit: Ha!  OP should do the same procedure for the data from the beginning to the 10th of april: I bet we would have a price of 10000$ already NOW!
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:38:05
Let's not forget the tragedy of commons!
IMHO it can be perfectly seen by looking at the BTC-price after the silkroad-incident: The price is now more or less how it was before the incident - indicating that silkroad had very little impact on BTC-price. Nevertheless everyone hit the "SELL"-Button two days ago - reacting highly irresponsible.
When the threat is big enough, every big whale will leave the sinking ship.
While I do think bitcoin is a great thing,  I am not as optimistic as the OP.
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:21:25
I only had a brief look, but it looks confusing to me:
When you change the prices to BTC the sorting-order of the rooms change! Otherwise... Nice

@_date: 2013-10-05 10:30:01
I don't say that you're wrong. The point I was trying to make is the following: The OP says something like this: "There are big bitcoin-investors, and to make their investment a successful one, they want bitcoin to succeed - supporting it with all the power they have."
I beg to differ. I'd say: "There are big bitcoin-investors, and they want to make their investment a successful one. This does not necessarily imply, that they want bitcoin to succeed."
Maybe the silkroad-incident was not the best example for this kind of behaviour.

I totally agree with the statement that whe haven't seen a "killer bitcoin app" yet. A use case where even my grandma could see the benefits of bitcoin.
But once that magic "killer app" is in the wild, we will see a huge rise in bitcoin price. I am unsure however if this will happen...
@_date: 2013-09-29 09:43:35
I'd imagine that in the future platforms like bitcoin.de will have to meet certain regulatory standards. So if you bought your BTC from there, maybe the exchange-site can "prove" the time you obtained the BTC.
Considering mining: To be sure, you need some trusted third party... perhaps like a notary, where you escrow the proof, that you are the owner of a certain address at a specific date.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:55:39
A bug in the protocol. This could lead to...
* Hackers manipulating transactions
* Hackers stealing money from existing addresses
* (D)DOS of the whole network
* BTC entering the Network without having been mined...
