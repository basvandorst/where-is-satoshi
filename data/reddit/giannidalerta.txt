Better to give them something than nothing. All they know is that they got access to a wallet with something. They can think you have,money under your mattress, bank accounts, another safe, so that logic means that they can mess with you for something they have no idea if you have or not.

What we need is for any popular musician to put out an album that can only be bought with bitcoin and when they tour, patrons can only buy tickets with Bitcoin. 
Imagine Jay Z announcing a concert that you can only attend if you got it with Bitcoin. He may not get the same turn out, but he could afford the loss (if he was a true supporter) in turn we'd have thousands of people looking into buying and learning about bitcoin. 
Up till now, there really has not been anything, a consumer really wants,  that can only be bought with Bitcoin 
We'd covert a portion of the population that is not typically interested in tech... theyd get it and use it for matters of complete utility. For something thry really want.

I have been to BTC Miami and BitcoinToronto2014. 
press releases/blogs/video do let you meet people face to face and network. That is why conferences exist. Meet vendors, get a feel for them as people. You have the opportunty to go to the after parties, have drinks, and converse on a casual setting.
This also draws the local communities, press, business people, students, etc. so that they can get a first hand view. Bitpay for example onboards merchants at these events. At Toronto they had free events for people just getting started.
Everyone is excited at these events, and bitcoin ties everyone together. There is not one person that I met that was snobby or was not interested in sharing ideas. (except for some suits)
At the end of the day, with our digital world, nothing beats shaking someone's hand.

I use purse.io and it worked great. Your system says a user can order from any merchant, how do you protect shipping addresses?

Ning site admins cannot impersonate, and if my memory serves me right, they cannot change a user's pw. Only ban, delete, or promote. They have no access to the db. At the beginning of ning, they could, but I don't you can any more and don't think you could access user records. I would think if it's not him, it would have had to be a hacked account. However the original poster surely was the original,  I would assume, the password used would be strong.

The most important part of this announcement is Intuit's  client base. If its easy for businesses to accept Bitcoin through the software or online versions of Quickbooks we will see an upsurge of Bitcoin adoption. Plus the fact that businesses trust Quickbooks, the very notion that they are getting involved will give Bitcoin a more positive frame of mind. Finally getting free of all the crap news that the media seems to love so much. Plus you know how it is when you talk to a business owner about bitcoin, they immediately reference the bad shit... just tell them Quickbooks is working on implementing it and you will see their comments change.
Hope this news spreads like wild fire through all the business news outlets.

This is better than visa or paypal going on board. This is a brand trusted by so many small businesses. The volume of small businesses is greater than than the big brands, getting a mass a small businesses, accepting bitcoin, having it easily integrate into their day to day book keeping and if they integrate the dreaded word tax record keeping. There will really be no reason for businesses not to accept Bitcoin.
This means that, payroll will be next up. 
This is another shot on the bow of the CC companies.

Even though Coinkite is not an exchange they do have a similar feature/policy. Here is an excerpt from their welcome email. 
" Attached is an encrypted copy of your private key. The password for that file will be publicized if Coinkite shuts down. Please save this welcome email or at least the attachment so you can retreive your funds if Coinkite closes. This file is encrypted with AES using a 256-bit key (AES-256-CBC)."

First impressions count. More so that this is a commercial site. Spend some bits and make site that actually works and potential sheds a better light on bitcoin and your own commercial intentions. It's selling advertising, why would anyone advertise, there is no strong compelling reason to return.
Make a biz directory, make it a news aggregator, make it a ticker, provide a free ecourse on bitcoin, something that would merit people to come back.

Everything at this point still goes to Fiat if you want to take it that far.  
The electricity spent to mine bitcoin, the salaries spent to make the internet work, so on and so on is all done in Fiat. 
We will not escape fiat. The fact that OP paid with his BTC is what matters. Right now its a VISA network, tomorrow it will be a blockchain network, and in turn the above noted fiat outputs can more easily done with crypto currencies.
One step at a time... and every step counts. ;)

@_date: 2017-06-18 19:25:06
If you have gold in a safe anywhere in the world, you do not need to declare the value. You only have to declare when you sell. Crypto is currently classified and property like gold or other objects. 
You only pay capital gains. If you keep records of what it cost you and when you sell if you had a lost or gain, that is all you pay. 
Get an accountant and stay clean. If you live in the states and they change the rules, best to keep everything on the up and up. Because they will find away to get their taxes. 
Also you are making a lot of assumptions of what the government will do. My own assumptions is that the governments will eventually have their own blockchains.

For a small gift you could probably print them out on an ink jet. If you have illustrator you can change the size and make them bigger. I made the pattern repeat up to 9x.
Another possibility is to send it to Kinkos or another print shop. Then have them print them out on a poster size sheet. Then you could wrap a nice large package. [FedEx Kinkos](
 and just found these people [Short Run Posters]( (not sure if they are good)

5 to 10 years from now I believe the victors will be those who build agnostic tech to facilitate all currency. As the recent IBM patent filing demonstrates. The open transactions library will facilitate the world to change the rules of money it's own terms. From the most granular. Amongst friends, amongst businesses,  amongst communities, and eventually the world. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:43:59
Its gonna be interesting to see how it pans out. By the time the governments step in there will be even more people with Bitcoin. Probably wealthy people at that and will probably put their own pressure. I
The key to success is to move into full circle commerce in Bitcoin. From payroll to materials to lending. All in Bitcoin. Then it will be much more difficult for the government to control it, when legit businesses are transacting in a closed loop.

In my opinion Coinkite is becoming your future Bank account. (well not a bank exactly, :P). Their BIP32 wallet is pretty cool. When I got my welcome email, I noticed the 2 accounts they setup in the system checking and savings, that is slick... One of the few who have this functionality. :)

I have been reading about the LETSystem which seems to me to be the combination of a shared general ledger and a community working together. the ledger keeping even actions in check. Crypto Currencies has opened a new dialog such as this topic. The small ideas as stated that will steam roll thoughts and innovations to all networks of all things. So exciting to see the birth of this. (Sorry for my rambling, I am just moved by all these conversations)

That sounds great! What kinda print shop you got? The files are editable in Illustrator so be my guest! If you sell them, just remember me and break me off a "bit". ;)

Put it on my reading list.

Now we need an anthem! Who is going to write it... should be multi-lingual. :)

The Bitcoin millionaires should pool their coin, buy a small island in a warm region of the world. Then build the citadel of the free market. We need a symbol like lady liberty. Bitconia would accept people and currency from all nations. (Loud roar of millions can be heard through the block chain.) [Kinda poetic, didn't know I had it in me. Lol]

All banks hate it. As they leverage your money. At some point the banks will have to pivot or become obsolete like the cassette tape. I see the exchanges becoming the new power houses.

Wait, its your store... !! gonna bookmark it and get a couple this week. My son loves TMNT, its full circle at my house. All we need is for a new He-Man series and we'd be set

South Florida includes Fort Lauderdale as well as West Palm Beach. So what is Metro Miami? The downtown area only? You forget Homestead and even the Redlands is Miami-Dade. Autoswing must not be a native! LOL...
Westchester, Kendall, and South Miami in the house!

Thanks to whom ever tipped me. That was quite generous. Gonna donate half to a cause!

Is there a subreddit for this?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:41:13
Not necessarily. Having branch "ATM" and when its mainstream... Will there be a need for physical currency. Imagine all aspects of commerce on crypto. Payroll and all. It would be a closed loop. Your ewallet is the bank.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:55:49
Yes. I'd get that same response if I posted something on FB. The general populous is technologically ignorant. However I think I'll try it with some of my close friends.

Im going to one in Miami in January. Not huge.
I think in the land of Bitcoinia may have a perpetual rave. Followed by fireworks showering the citizens with QR code confetti. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:01:16
to think that an accounting ledger (the blockchain) maybe the answer to Government 2.0

They felt patriotic about Enron? That was a corporation. This is a movement in my mind. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:48:29
Bam... done. I gave him just a BIT of my mind. It's worth to much. ;)
