Yes, but still about 50 000 users will be able to reload their MyWay card with Bitcoins.

OK, I'm from sweden so my danish isn't that good.
"Finanstilsynet har således i et konkret tilfælde godkendt, at et selskab ikke skal have tilladelse for at kunne etablere sig her i landet "
I tried reading a few times but I can't figure out if "a company don't need permission to exchange bitcoins" OR "a company does not have permission to exchange bitcoins".
 writes like this: 
-"Og tilsynet skriver i sin meddelelse i dag, at det har nægtet at give et konkret selskab tilladelse til at etablere sig i Danmark". 
I have a hard time translating this into something positive.
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:35:26
Awesome. Thanks you for correcting me :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:51:01

@_date: 2013-12-17 11:07:54
You guys are aware that what they are saying is: It is NOT allowed to run a Bitcoin exchange in the country... ?
EDIT: Sorry, I take it back. My danish betrayed me.
