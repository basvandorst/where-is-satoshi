Isn't the whole point of bitcoin supposed to be that nobody should be able to get fucked out of it?

You think the two people correcting a super simple grammar mistake that everyone should understand is a waste of time? Not the guy who takes a moment out of his day to leave a bratty, insulting comment against the guy trying to help?

If you're getting offended it's probably because you have trouble with it. It's easy, then deals with time, than deals with amounts.

My dad designed cones of dunshire and beat a CEO at it.

I hope Uber is a momentary singularity between centralized and decentralized Earth.

I like to think that your average bitcoin user avoids Walmart.

If there's one thing we can count on Microsoft for, it's to take our money.

Not sure why a post like this would be upvoted. I understand announcements that a new company is accepting bitcoin, but this is a bit much.

Good thing safecoin is the future.

What exactly is your point here? First you're mad that he is using encryption at all then you're mad that he's not doing enough to oppose the government? Take some psyllium husk and try to poop.

"A stock?" Bitcoin is very volatile as an investment, not sure why anyone would choose to argue that.
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:23:11
I wouldn't say I'm trying to make a point as much as I'm just saying that bitcoin is volatile as an investment.

Maybe I'm naive, why is that funny? I mean did it have a qr code? Or if it was just a decoration that's cool too right?

You say he "allowed" a random guy to elecrocute dogs, I say he had a random guy elecrocute dogs. Let's stop speaking in trumpisms. You know what happened as well as I do.
Edison was a deeply greedy and self-centered person. So it's no surprise he is known for being a pioneer in the modern system of getting a bunch of brilliant people to create money and fame for a few non-contributing benefactors at the top.
Imperfect as it may be, it's still probably a net benefit to our modern society, and thats probably why it's the only thing that has ever impressed me about edisons's contributions. of course, I hope we can move beyond this 1900 style thinking as we move into the third decade of the new milenium.
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:11:23
Oh okya, he hired a guy named Harold to pull the trigger. That's wayyy different.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:33:29
If you elecrocute dogs, you deserve to be remembered as a dog elecrocutor. Whether your friend pulls the lever in your name or not.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:57:12
Great, then NY and CA can stop funding modern life in the shitty little welfare states that vote against the interests of our nation every 2 years.
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:06:30
Edison elecrocuted dogs to "prove" ac was "dangerous". He was a jealous twat and always knew ac was the superior current. Edison is truly one of the pieces of shit of history that are still remembered favorably. Right up there with Columbus.

This is one of the worst analogies I've ever seen. Is your..brain...an idiot?

Bank cards are protected by a bank. If it's lost its instantly frozen and any fraudulent purchases are refunded.

This might sound weird but this is one of my favorite Reddit things ever. Jesus Christ that was genuinely funny.

I think you're missing the point of why these people are buying used Bentleys.

Which is why you can get such a great deal! Come on down to Mauron's for more bargains just like this!

I hope so!
@_date: 2015-11-26 20:16:52
You're right. Although I wouldn't be surprised if it was a company that built services on top of that decentralized service layer. Much like OpenBazaar intends to do.
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:39:28
Yeah but probably by a company with a better name.
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:26:49
Well this sucks. I would much prefer to see a scientific assessment or metaanalysis of some sort, but this is already super fucked up just that it's happening more than a handful of times.
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:37:09
Come on, is this happening in alot of small towns? Like what, more than 10? Where?
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:54:35
Now try again without words like "idiot" and "moron" and with explanation for your inclinations.
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:08:42
Good job man.

I haven't checked every day on purpose, but I have not seen it drop since I started following at about $60-$70 (almost a month ago).
@_date: 2013-08-06 19:13:58
I don't think any bank has a system like this, where you could microtip a website, article, or person for free. That's really the point in the end, right? Getting past the banks and credit card companies?
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:24:18
And the credit card fee still isn't there?
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:28:18
Cool. Did not realize this.

@_date: 2013-08-06 19:17:18
There would be thousands of those $0.05 micropayments, that's the usefulness of the system, but without that little snipe at the end your point stands.
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:01:17
Worst bar graph ever.

Yeah makes sense.

... and the opposite currently considered true by the consensus.

Whoa dude. That's my first bitcoin tip. I thought I needed to have some sort of "bitcoin wallet" or other thing I don't understand.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:32:49
I'm well aware of basic math. 
Not meant to sound dickish ...

I'm just going through my hemhaws. I know it's a market, I just think it's a new market that is going to change the world or die, and it doesn't seem to be dying just yet, so it's an interesting situation. I think I'm gonna buy.
