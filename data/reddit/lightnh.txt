But except very few no one is taking him as serious threat. Your average Joe is not going to figure it out based on the narrative media is giving out.

Agreed, he must have made ton. I wonder how long it will carry out for.

Thanks. Just read through it... makes sense and I should have read the whole stuff.

You can dump it on Okex. I am not against that coin as I never went through the white paper but the whole  gambit which is playing out will leave the crypto with stigma.

I am having a hard time digesting the fact that he was granted the copyright for white paper and code. His statement of bringing bitcoins under government regulatory framework just tells what might be under the play.

Can I get that bitcoin now... You can keep the banana.

Idk about bitpay... Anyone wanna chime in

Honestly more crypto exchange should delist bsv. It screams scam to me.

hmm you are right, but when I think of crypto I think of lack of regulation ��

That guy is going to be the running joke of the year, but he had it coming.

It does apply to crypto currencies as a whole.

I agree with you to a certain extent but it applies to rallies which last over days or weeks. Very basic TA works for intraday trading, but it does not carry many concepts from stocks or forex trading. People say to diversify your assets but bitcoin or any cryptocurrency for that matter is more of an ideology that you buy into.
