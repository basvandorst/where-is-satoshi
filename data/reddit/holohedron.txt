I hope not, the recycling business hardly needs any help. They're total scumbags *knowingly* accepting material like copper cables stolen from live railway and lead from church roofs. It costs the country millions in train delay minutes and replacement costs, churches are ruined through water damage and can't often can't afford a new roof, it's increasingly difficult to get insurance.
It's not like the thieves or scrap dealers make much money either, they sell this stuff for a few hundred when it costs thousands to buy new and install.

If these types of encryption were broken in some way, wouldn't that mean that not just Bitcoin but potentially many different financial transactions within the current banking system would also be effected? 
I really don't know much about encryption but it strikes me that there would essentially be complete chaos throughout the banking system if such systems became vulnerable without sufficient warning.

[ has both and has been very reliable for me. They also do discounts for redditors but I'm afraid I've forgotten the code now.

Ahh missed the Canadian part, don't they have any armodafinil in stock? It's branded as Waklert [on this page](
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:37:35
It is known.

So I'm guessing it's too late to make an order with BFL then, if you want to be in with a chance of making an ROI?

Definitely [check out Pendulum]( It was a real loss to the DnB community when they split up and went full dubstep.

I've used [ukforex.co.uk]( successfully before, they weren't much more expensive than TransferWise and cheaper than all the others.

Whenever it has stabilised for a significant amount of time in the past, this has usually preceded a rise in value.

You know the saying, in a gold rush sell shovels.

I don't like it either, I can't tell if this is a bubble or a genuine rise due to all the recent generally positive exposure (and any exposure probably helps). 
It's a completely nuts growth rate but then Bitcoin is pretty unique, and lots of people are going to want at least one BTC, just because. How many accounts are still to be verified on Mt. Gox, 8000 or so? Maybe this is just what the initial growth rate looks like for something like Bitcoin.

What really scares me is not just that he's asking these questions in public, it's the reason why. It suggests that he can't afford to hire someone competent to do it for him.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:06:04
I doubt it's a conspiracy. I don't see any reason not to believe it's as TransferWise's statement says - that the banks simply want nothing to do with it until they've been issued guidance by financial regulators to ensure they're not potentially getting involved with fraud or money laundering.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:38:21
bitcoin-24.com is a good one, no transaction fees. From the UK, you can fund the account with EUR using a currency exchange service like [TransferWise]( to avoid being anally violated by your bank manager.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:55
Actually Bitcoin-24 has performed really well throughout this particular crash. Even the chat has stayed operational.

He took both credit cards and bitcoin. I'm not entirely convinced this was a planned scam from beginning to end either, he certainly played the part of 'guy who took on too much and was in over his head' quite well if it was.

You might want to wait a bit and sell the order position on ebay. Sometimes orders from even just a month ago sell for quite a bit more than you paid for it.
@_date: 2013-03-17 20:18:20


Well, in the past a steady price has nearly always precluded a significant rise. I realise I'm kinda stating the obvious here though.

Someone usually posts the ['You Are Here']( image about now. I think a 'return to mean' isn't unlikely, although how far down it goes is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2013-05-08 12:27:47
Surely it would also be unwise to determine that something is 'rat poison' without properly understanding it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:03:47
Would it make you feel any better if I told you I lost over 100? Sadly I've got nothing like that number now but... got to be glad if you still have some at all the end of the day, plenty will have lost potential millions.

Actually I think he did take bitcoin payments. This is from buzzdave, 'Head of PR for BTCFPGA': -
