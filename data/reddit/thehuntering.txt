I made a quick BF script yesterday and left it running overnight, never found any BTC
It uses the white BIP39 words in the circle and pairs them up into 9 pairs and then adding the pairs from hints "code easily" "almost open" "attack early" randomly somewhere in there to give a 24 word seed generated with paired words
It created around 20,000-30,000 valid seeds from around 10million combinations all with 0 balance.
Here is a CSV it created with details of the valid seeds; generates first 1-5 addresses from the seeds so there will be duplicate seeds with different public addresses - 
Probably not on the right track and have no chance but i'll leave it running so I don't think about wasting anymore of my time physically looking myself
EDIT: Python Script -

Thats the chance I take - easy to change to 12 but you'd need to re-run the results
It was just abit of fun, probably have a better chance of solving a block without an ascii than BF'ing this

I presume the same try this (from electrum github README) ... 
Check out the code from GitHub:
git clone git://github.com/spesmilo/electrum.git
cd electrum
Run install (this should install dependencies):
pip3 install .[full]
To run it .... python3 guess_pairs.py
