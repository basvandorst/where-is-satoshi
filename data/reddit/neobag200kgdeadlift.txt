Tether rumors were true. Without it its deflated so much.
The minor price bumps now are exchange manipulation to trap more suckers down to the bleed to $1k
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:26:00
By next week.
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:10:36
this market is a load of crap. 2 weeks ago we were about to break 10k and now we're on the verge of dumping to 6\-7k. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:13:50
no but it gives big stakeholders a reason to short and then blame it on them.
fuck those old dinosaurs. Who says "worse than trading baby brains"? They have an agenda regardless
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:16:52
Meanwhile exchanges and whales use these stupid dinosaurs Warren Buffett and Bill Gates sentiment on the BTC market to short it for their own personal benefit. Next day, CNBC: "Bitcoin drops $600 after leading investors call it rat poison"

BTC tx are slow as hell right now. I paid the equivalent of $15 and its been an hour. Nothing
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:07:27
New TA approach \-\&gt; What goes up is manipulated, expect it to come down and then some
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:29:01
Tether has been artificially pumping BTC since Feb 2017. When it got audited and stopped pumping in January of this year, that was when BTC collapsed. They printed more tether to pump it than any time in December which made it go to 20k

June 8th and sitting at 7500. Consensus and the  institutional money meme
@_date: 2018-06-05 03:07:47
Anyone not believe in this shit anymore and are just bagholding with the hopes that their alt coins will be untethered from this bitmex/bitfinex ponzi scheme eventually?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:19:02
Its been on a decline for 80 days. How many falling knives would you like to catch?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:47:41
Should have listened to this guy in January. He called it to a T.
Meanwhile we've been getting dumped on nonstop
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:23:21
What did you do when you realized we've been in a 5 year long bull trap, separated into two sections?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:40:16
Starting to believe the slow burn to 1k levels meme.
The rich get richer, the general public gets taken advantage of with a select few that got lucky.
edit: don't think for a second people with a lot of power and a lot of stake aren't collaborating right now to either take this market out or let it live again. this could very well be one of the biggest transfers of wealth in human history to the already elite
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:24:08
FUCK. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:50:23
We're so fucked. 
Everything the above alleged insider said has been coming true. Slow dump that has not recovered since his final point on Jan 15th.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:22:43
nah I still have $60k in my retirement account. but fiat wise yes.
I started with $50k though hit a high of $300k and now Im at $100k, so most of it was unrealized profits. Still stings badly
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:49:19
Who's down to go to 
I am part of the 99%
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:00:44
I legit feel disgusting right now that I didnt cash out in Dec. *WHAAAT WAS I THINKING OHHH MAN*
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:53:28
its fucking over lol. wew lad
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:45:28
BTC 24h low on Binance: 6,666.66 on good friday.
Never in my 30 years trading bitcoin have I seen this before. This is clear manipulations by the goyums alongside Satan. A very clear message to transfer the wealth to them
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:53:20
Jan 15
Comment: That was the final squeeze. If you followed my chart and stuck to the facts and the original plan you would have still be sitting pretty (btc not going over 15k and looking like not going over 14.4 - loaded up on shorts between 13.9 - 14.2). 
Still over 2 months later and BTC is well below those levels. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:47:57
My max is closer to 220kg now
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:08:07
Lol. Try being down -$200,000

Where can you buy with a cc these days that isnt banned? And without cash advance?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:43:21
IDK, i think this is all eluding to poloniex opening their trading desk soon and for big money to buy in cheap. It makes me really think if BTC will ever be above 15k again - if they buy in at 7000 and double it to 14k while remaining stable, they win and minimize risk while maintaining liquidity. the only people that lose are the people that got tricked in the dec run
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:12:49
Well the past 3 months have been a glorious waste of time and emotional energy.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:26:58
Been in since July and Im basically break even lol. I could sell it all right now, but damn Ill prob feel twice as shitty if I miss 2 moons. Im hoping for a relief rally in the next 2 weeks - I will sell 20&amp; of it then.
Protip - take profits 
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:21:30
Dude what the fuck. Its mid July and we are 70&amp; from ATH still. I bought a bunch of BTC at 3.5-4.0k and I regret not selling this shit a while ago. 
My friends who invested in Amazon at 1,000 usd are up 80&amp;

I had to stop reading because this article was so amateurishly written and was all opinionated. Writer has an agenda or is just clueless.
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:09:41
These bears need to fuck off already. How many times are we going to play ping pong with 9k? Die motherfuckas
