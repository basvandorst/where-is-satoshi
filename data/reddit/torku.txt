What does he mean “Probably if you have anything at all on Coinbase they have your records.”
The IRS only won access to transactions greater than 20k.

I don’t think so. “... information is limited to those accounts with at least $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year from 2013 to 2015.”

Thanks for the answer. I would never hold on a foreign exchange. Only purchase and quickly move the coins to my own address.

They are helping to grow the space by getting crypto in people's pockets.

Look at the history. You have to be in this for the long haul. What did you think would happen? You rolled the dice and lost on a short term gain. You still have a chance at long term. Or you can sell now and never think about it again. Blue pill or red bill bitch. What’s it gonna be?

The purchasing and selling are primarily what identify you because both usually require some form of identification (unless you use localbitcoins). Although it's a good practice to use Tor and a VPN, using either while conducting bitcoin transactions with electrum or other bitcoin software does not provide much "protection" in the form of anonymity because the blockchain does not store IP addresses associated with transactions. 
So it's good practice to use Tor and VPN to avoid being snaked by software like the NSA used in the article, but just know that using a VPN or Tor will not protect your anonymity while conducting a bitcoin transaction. Your identity is usually discovered when you acquire or sell the coins for fiat.

Right, that's the real point. Institutionalize crypto. Get it embedded. Makes it that much harder for governments to move against it.

Good reply. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:37:27
Thanks. That’s helpful. If audited, I assume there would have to be some proof and that would come from trading records wherever you cashed out to fiat, for example at Coinbase or an exchange, and the records would show your addresses, right?

One of the best yet.

This is reddit. Worse, it’s a crypto subreddit which means there’s no evidence or factual basis for comments. Don’t expect him to back up his idiotic statement.

If you’re in the US bitcoin serves you better as a reserve asset that you hold much like gold and NOT as a currency that you on a day to day basis. Using for something as simple as a cup of coffee is a taxable event and triggers a paperwork requirement when filing your taxes. Some countries support bitcoin as a currency but the US does not.

When you pay your state taxes with bitcoin you then have to file that trade on your federal taxes the following year and pay capital gain/loss. 
Paying taxes with bitcoin then becomes a taxable event.
Does anyone see the irony?

Back up your comment. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:02:23
Great point. I would only need records showing the purchase and the sale.
Side point: Becomes more difficult if one purchased from a source such as localbitcoins.com because there could potentially be little to no record of purchase if one used cash. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:26:09
That was my thought and the reason I would never want to have to provide bitcoin addresses nor trace original purchase to final sale (I wouldn't be able to).
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:08:49
Say I purchased five bitcoins from coinbase several years ago and ran them through mixers and passed them through different addresses across different wallets just experimenting in the earlier days when bitcoin was cheaper. 
When I cash out I should be fine even though the coins can’t be directly traced from the initial purchase to the final sale, right? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:28:15
You need to explain this further. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:03:56
Localbitcoins.com was an option too.

There's so much wrong with your comment that I'm not sure I should take the time to break it down.
Forget for a second about trying to evade paying taxes on hundreds of thousands worth of gains - which I would never advise doing. Have you ever looked into buying gold with bitcoin for that amount? Have you found a dealer that would sell you gold anonymously? There are only a few dealers that handle bitcoin and all require a name and shipping address and at least one has a cap of a few thousand dollars if you're paying with crypto. 
I understand where you're coming from but your ideas are naive and would only get you in trouble. The U.S. government has vast resources and agreements with other countries looking for people who do this very kind of stuff. There's no way I would buy real estate overseas anywhere or park money in any offshore account knowing full well that countries cooperate with the U.S. If not today, then certainly in the future. Don't believe me? Look at the age old Swiss banks that were so private. Back in 2008 or so they crumbled by the dozens and gave in to the U.S. and tossed their clients to the wolves.
Much easier to pay the tax man and live free and clear.
