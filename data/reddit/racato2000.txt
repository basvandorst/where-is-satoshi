very educational and informative; this piece, together with the video, are the first endorsement by a central bank and an acknowledgement of a reality that some refuse to see. This is a bold move and a very positive sign. In my mind, we are way beyond the point of no return for bitcoin.

Where bitcoin will be "late 2015" is anybody's guess. Not in my wildest dreams I could have ever suspected this thing would get to $650 a piece by mid 2014, when I first heard about it back in 2010. then I investigated a bit further in 2011 and it still sounded like a joke. In all honesty, I am surprised this has not taken off like a rocket, but like you, this is just my opinion. Everyone should do their own research and invest only what they can afford to lose. Be very careful with crazy predictions, people tend to think you are a fool.

He is spot on.
I wished all Presidents had given some thought to the bitcoin concept and how it can help run a more efficient service. Also, what some refer to as the killer up is simply the moment in time in which bitcoin will be used seamlessly without anybody asking what it is, who invented it, where is Satoshi and so on: if it provides a valuable service at a quasi zero cost, who cares about all the rest?.

This animated introduction to Bitcoin is easy to understand because it detaches the concept of a decentralized general ledger and use of the coins from all technical explanations, including the concept of encryption; what is holding bitcoin adoption is the need to be a technical guru to safely acquire, use and store your coins. Apps that remove all technical barriers will be key to massive adoption.

I admire you for that, many of us have the same issues trying to explain bitcoin to older folks who we respect and care for. I am on the same boat, my daughter's college fund will be paid with bitcoin. Buy some and save some for them, there is no need to tell them, just share with those who you love the fruits of your vision, patience and perseverance, once the time is right.

What he is saying its that the  btc ecosystem which is being developed at rapid pace will soon be providing multiple ways of benefitting from the underlying technology in a fool-proof, frictionless, effort-less form which will drive mass adoption - without adopters really needing to know/understand what is enabling such services and solutions in the first place.

coming from WF, this is a very balanced, informative and accurate analysis of the state of things. you may agree with it or not but they have done a pretty good effort in trying to explain btc, its potential and its risks. WF is more credible to me after reading this.
