Tried it. Loved it, gonna keep using it. Even if it becomes $0.99 in the future, totally gonna buy it.
Some pros:
- Intuitive UI
- Great layout
- Pie-graph portfolio
- Primary and secondary currency for portfolio
- Choice between linegraphs and bargraphs for change in currency
- Preset changes over time instead of dragging a pointer on a graph
Btw, own your app my dude. It's a solid app. Lol, don't need to call out the other kid.
Also I know you said somewhere in this thread, that you haven't looked into developing an iOS version yet but if you want this app to reach people, having it on both platforms is a plus. I was showing your app to a friend and he was bummed he couldn't download it too because he has an iPhone.

If you look at trends from bitcoins inception. This has happened before. And what you're saying is if I can predict long term trends but can't predict short term trends I shouldn't invest period? That's some investment broker logic there.
Also why do you care if I lose my money? It's mine to lose, I can afford to lose it, I can afford to invest long term if I want to. Why are you trying so hard convince me that I shouldn't invest at all?

No worries, I can understand being defensive of something you've worked so hard on, only to get shutdown before it's even viewed by a bunch of people.
Again, solid work on the app, I really like it. And I hope it gets really big. Would love if it becomes one of the bigger crypto monitoring apps out there. :)

LOL, so many people are either panicking, mad or feeling vindicated they can say "I told you so."
Meanwhile I'm here wishing I had more disposable income to buy this incredible dip. For the hodler's out there, this bear run will pass and when it does, the hodler's will prosper. You've seen so many stories of people who panic sold because they either didn't have the nerve to keep hodling or they invested money they couldn't afford to lose. If you're in it for the long haul, keep hodling.

Interesting point of view. I don't quite agree on the long term investment bit though. I do agree that I'm probably getting peanuts compared to the day traders that capitalize on  immediate trends but I still think in the long run I'll be in the positive.
But hey, I guess time will tell. :)

You should never invest anything you can't afford to lose in crypto. It's a volatile market with high risk and high rewards.
But if you're taking out a second mortgage to ride the crypto train then crypto isn't for you. I have fully accepted that the money I invested in crypto could turn to $0 tomorrow but it's a risk I'm willing to take because I can afford to lose it. Because I only invest what I can and not what I want to. If crypto disappears tomorrow I won't be bankrupt. But I'm willing to bet that the people that are panicking are the ones that are relying on crypto to pay bills and rent.

For the record I don't think it's ok to call people cowards. It's the wrong word to use. But I do think it's okay to call them out for being foolish enough to invest what they can't afford to. Along with foolish, I'd also like to say that the people panicking are not properly versed on crypto trends. Similar dips have happened in the past. They just need to look at the data and realize this.
That's the point I was trying to make. There wouldn't be any people panicking if those people weren't investing what they couldn't afford to lose.

You're 100% right. I could maximize my gains and If I had more time, I would love to do exactly that. Unfortunately predicting short term trends is very difficult and unless you have means of influencing the market (whales, corps, news org, insider trading, etc) it's difficult to really capitalize on it, but as a common investor with small stakes, it's safer to play the long trends as those are slightly more predictable.
So yes, I will continue to hodl because for me, it's safer in the long run. Buy the dips and keep hodling. That being said hodlig is not for an infinite time period. I have set a sell limit for myself but since I have not reached it yet, I will keep hodling. :)

LOL, ok. Lemme know how that goes.
@_date: 2018-10-21 03:11:52
...well, she's not entirely wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:38:05
You don't lose anything until you change your crypto to FIAT. ;)
Think of it, like a long-term investment. Come back in 5 years and we'll talk then.

LOL, don't look at the charts right now. It would be the reverse of this gif.

I wonder if that's for the Ecuadorian government, lol
What did he expect? Dude tried to blackmail the very country that was harboring him. That's some 200 IQ stuff right there.

I wouldn't worry about that. US won't have many friends for long. They've been doing a good job of isolating themselves from their allies, while simultaneously pissing off opposing world powers. It's impressive to stand by and watch.

So no one is gonna mention the whale that recently bought 400 million in BTC and that's the reason for the recent surge?
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:18:14
Not likely. There are some days where no transactions occur.
If this was truly a fortknox for an exchange:
1. It would have transactions more frequently then just a few days at a time.
2. Transactions would be large dumps with uniform amounts, not erratic amount deposits that most likely coincide with purchase orders being completed and transferred.
3. It would be very foolish for exchanged to keep all their funds in one wallet.

As much as I'd love to spend my crypto, none of the entities I spend my money at accept crypto:
This includes:
- Local supermarkets
- City transit
- My bank
- Utilities companies
- Bars
- Restaurants
- Food delivery services
- Postal companies
- Game stores (steam used to accept it but no more :/ )
- Health services
Half the problem is that not as many people accept it because it's so volatile. If more people accepted it, more people would spend it.
The fact of the matter is that the main use of crypto was and always has been black market transactions.
We need more wide-spread acceptance of crypto for it to be spent/exchanged consistently.
