Well, it happens, unfortunately. 
If agreements with listed companies can go awry, what do you think will happen to those agreements made anonymously with an anonymous currency?
The reason its so funny is you can tell people "we won't dilute" but go ahead and dilute in a different way.  It's no guarantee.  
@_date: 2012-08-21 17:31:09
HONESTLY, the funniest goddamn thing about this "IPO" is the statement about never being diluted.  That shit is funny as hell to me.

Totally correct. It's easier to be negative that take the risk.

These people invested anonymously in an anonymous person who uses the name "Pirate," who is promising 7% weekly returns.
What were their expectations?

Shame on ANYONE who believes this.
@_date: 2012-08-21 17:29:52
Pardon, but I love example by extreme.
I look at investing in BitCoin like investing with a non-mainstream sovereign currency.  Not only do you have to weigh the investment itself, but the stability of the currency.
For example, if I want to invest in a Costa Rican company, but they will only accept CR Peso, and will only pay in CR Peso, my risk is in the company itself, AND the stability/volatility of the CR Peso.
BitCoin is NOT a sovereign currency.  Some try to argue this gives it stability.  At this point, it just makes it risky.  There are several threats: 51% attack, government pursuit, some other fallout, anything really.  It's not just that people will say "hah, fuck it!"  But that might happen too.
What if application specific chips come out and flood the market?   
@_date: 2012-12-15 21:50:46
I totally agree, the business does exist.  Just not at all like this.  This is bad fiction.
@_date: 2012-12-15 17:49:41
Who are you and why are you doing this?
@_date: 2012-08-21 01:41:30
Strangely, you have it backwards.
A price to earnings of 10x means if you buy the company in cash today, you can expect to earn your investment back in 10 years.
There is a damn good possibility that BitCoin will totally DISAPPEAR in the next year.  If you pay 10x, you're more than fucked.
This business is maybe, MAYBE worth 1x.  MAYBE.

I completely disagree.  LR broke laws.  Using Bitcoin does not mean you broke a law.  It is not a reasonable assumption to believe that if LR was prosecuted, so will Bitcoin users.

Or maybe people should reach a default conclusion of "that person is probably just in it for the money" instead of "that person is a hero."  Right now, Bitcoin is being held back by some community members being hailed as heroes, who then run off in the middle of the night with a lot of money.
I agree, its great that Avalon succeeded.  But don't call a company "heroic" because they deliver a product.
