That's not the point though. The point is that they're doing the best they possibly can to reveal the depth of the US surveillance state. 
Companies like Twitter and Reddit have been fighting to reveal even the tiniest fraction of the NSLs they receive with minimal success. They can't talk about it. They can't reveal how many requests they receive. All they can do it *not* talk about it, which is what this dead canary represents.
All we know is that roughly 300,000 NSLs have been issued and no one but the FBI knows how they're being used. The potential for abuse of these powers is staggering.

Because, and this is fundamental to Bitcoin's new economics, the distribution of Bitcoin is enforced by code, not by the whims of central banks, and is of limited and finite supply.
It's certainly not a fiat currency, but it's not really a commodity.
This is revolutionary stuff. No asset has ever had either of these properties -- because even precious metals can be continually mined. Bitcoin is simply not like other assets; it does not play by the same rules.

The short answer is that you just use a secure, safe open source software to generate the keys and then you print them out. (Bitaddress.org is the favorite)

You actually don't know that. They can choose to keep it if they want to. The merchant gets to set the percentage (if any) of the transaction that's converted to fiat. Until now, most speculation has been that they're selling it all, but it's also possible that they're trying to stockpile. It's one potential explanation for an almost impossibly good sale.

That's a cynical way of putting it, but you're basically correct. It was designed that way -- that is, it was designed to incentivize early adoption.
There are many reasons for this, but the most important is that it would have been very easy for a malicious actor to disrupt the early Bitcoin network, and so mining was heavily rewarded by the protocol. This was done in order to secure and protect the nascent blockchain by rewarding miners for their time and hardware costs.
But it doesn't really matter. Over the next several boom and bust cycles older coins will be sold and redistributed, and each time, a larger and larger portion of people will have a piece of the pie. And FYI, this is still the very early days of Bitcoin and anyone with $5 can buy some. It's not like the bar to entry is that high anymore.

There's zero incentive to do so. Assuming that miners and users reached consensus on a hard fork (which would be all but impossible) it would only serve to de-value everyone's current holdings.

There is no universe in which we'd have a deflationary collapse. That was only even a possibility because of the gold standard. Today, faced with a Great Depression, we'd have more Quantitative Easing, increased Federal spending and desperate attempts to create more inflation. ("helicopter money" as they call it.)
The Fed can simply create more money until they reach their inflationary goals -- they will, in no circumstances, allow the economy to deflate. I really don't see how that's even on the table because it would lower tax revenue in real terms while also increasing the Federal debt load. Deflation is simply not an option for the Fed; they will move heaven and earth to make sure of that.

You're correct, but you're also missing the point.
The point is that the most likely scenario is one where Satoshi destroyed the keys to those early coins. If Bitcoin was some kind of elaborate get-rich-quick scheme for Satoshi, he/she/they have had hundreds of opportunities to cash out for tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars over the last several years. But cashing out, as you say, would also wreck havoc on the entire system.
Given the fact that Bitcoin is a highly unlikely success, and given the fact that those early coins have never moved, it is also highly unlikely that they ever will. 
It's most probable that those keys were destroyed by Satoshi at a time when Bitcoin was worth nothing. It wouldn't have been any loss to do so (they weren't convertible to fiat then anyway) and the temptation to ever use them would have been removed, thus insuring the future health of the entire BTC ecosystem.

This is really fascinating to watch. 
I know it's illiquid and shallow and is clearly divorced from reality, but at the same time it's the first exposure BTC has ever had to mainstream financial markets. (Even if it is OTC)
I know the ETF hype train is like a dead horse at this point, but I really can't help but wonder what would happen if an ETF actually launched on a regulated exchange with exposure to nearly unlimited amounts of IRA/401(k) money. If/when this does happen, with a falling inflation rate in 2016, wouldn't Bitcoin be seen as an attractive store of value? By the mid-2020s, Bitcoin will be almost totally deflationary, in such a scenario wouldn't it be competitive with other, more traditional, inflation hedges?
The only missing piece is exposure to the larger market.

Steam is smaller than Newegg and TigerDirect. A few years ago Forbes estimated that Steam has [half of the $4 billion PC download market]( But Valve is private and they don't release public numbers.
In 2013, Newegg alone had $2.7 billion in gross revenue. [TigerDirect had $3.4 billion.](

It's interesting, because I've noticed the same things in several Bitcoin related subs. People will resort to conspiracy theories to try and explain the FUD that has become so common here, but the simplest explanation is probably true: people don't like being patient, they don't like waiting, and they don't like being told that the "next big thing" is somewhere off, over the horizon.
We fall back on so many "Well, when ____ happens..." lines, "Well, when the block halving happens..." or "well, when the ETF goes live..." or "Well, when the next VC funded company implements...." but when they don't occur, or they take longer than we wish, we become cynical about any similar responses.
It's hard not to get caught up in the hype around cryptos, and then get caught up in the pessimism when they don't revolutionize things as quickly or as well as we hoped. I won't trot out any tired comparisons to the early internet here, because you've heard them all. But I will say that waiting and watching BBSes develop into the Web and then watching the rise of social media and then experiencing the mobile revolution has made me realize that we don't know where this particular road will lead, but I can guarantee it will be somewhere unexpected.

I think this would be true if we were talking about a stock split or something, but because deflationary cryptocurrency has never existed before, I don't believe the situation is predictable.
For example, the price of BTC before the last halving was $12. According to your argument, the market should have "known" that the halving was coming and the price should have been.... What, in this case? $255? But clearly there was a lot of turmoil between then and now.
Do you see what I mean? It still feels like we're in a wild price discovery phase. We know about all the other halvings too... So in your model, what is the ideal price at the current time? 
I don't really believe that anything is "factored in" to the price of Bitcoin. It's just far too speculative for that to be the case or for the market to price efficiently.

Bitcoin already DOES create passive income. It's deflationary by design. And after this initial period of inflation it is designed to become an ideal store of value. 
Because Bitcoin is (or, in reality, *will be*) deflationary, economic theory says that it will slowly increase in value, especially against other, inflationary, units of value (the Dollar, the Euro,etc.) 
But we're in uncharted territory here, there has never been an asset that is truly deflationary. Even Gold can be mined, found on asteroids, etc.
Eventually, Bitcoin could become one of the best passive investments in human history, a rock solid, deflationary store of value with a predictable rate of growth vs. other currencies and other competing altcoins.
It doesn't have to generate passive income because it *is* passive income.

There are many use cases for Bitcoin that go above and beyond what can be done in the "normal" banking world. Let me just offer a couple examples, very briefly. 
First, Bitcoin is the first truly deflationary asset ever created. Even gold can continue to be mined. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.  It cannot be printed by governments. It cannot be devalued. It's monetary policy is immutably fixed by code. That alone is revolutionary.
Second, with Bitcoin, I can literally memorize a 12 word phrase, and walk across a national border with my entire life savings "in my head." No chance it can be stolen from me or confiscated through any normal means. I could move 100 million dollars essentially "in cash" just by knowing a dozen words. Or, I can create a wallet that needs two of three passphrases in order to unlock it. You don't need a bank safe deposit box any more. The blockchain IS the safe deposit box.
It's things like this that make Bitcoin extraordinary.

Andreas said -- I think it was in the "dinner" video -- that he expects a handful of altcoins to succeed. It is useful to have another currency to use for arbitrage or to hedge against the others or simply because they offer fundamentally different features. I see proof-of-stake vs. proof-of-work being the best example of the latter: Bitcoin will never adopt proof-of-stake so it makes sense that a currency that does, or a currency designed with mechanisms for inflation (like Peercoin) would offer a solid alternative store of value for many people.

Nearly every transaction has a fee. Miners will want to mine because they'll be paid these fees.  Miners can choose to only accept blocks with a certain amount of fees in them. The free market will do the rest. If you're a cheapskate and pay low or zero fees it will take a long time for your transaction to be processed.

Any kind of major sale could cause a chain reaction of panic selling. This has happened before as more and more people try and cash in and cause the price to crash. However, this can and perhaps will recover in the long-term. 
The question is, what is the true vale of a bitcoin? The problem is that we have no idea. At some point the market will stabilize as people use BTC for regular transactions -- but what the price figure on that is... $10 or $10,000 is anyone's guess.

So, by many estimates, Satoshi owns around a million BTC. If Satoshi was in it for the money, he would have sold his coins when they were worth over a billion dollars (on paper anyway). Even $600 or $700 million is a crazy amount of money. Don't you think he would have already tried to cash out? 
Why wait? "$1 billion isn't enough... I need $2 billion!" It just doesn't make any sense. If it was a pyramid scheme he would have tried to exit the market a long time ago and the nice thing about the blockchain is that we know for a fact that Satoshi has never touched the early coins he mined.

They haven't. He/she/they mined the coins, dropped 50 BTC block rewards into a new address each time, and simply left them there.

FYI, there's lots of crap in that first address for the Genesis Block coins, but if you use the filters you'll see that nothing has been spent, just dust added by people trying to make a statement or fishing for coins. Once you get to about block 5 [and its output address,]( things become much less busy.

[Here's what you're looking for.]( And no, transaction fees are a tiny fraction of the current block rewards. 
As you can see from that graph, transaction fees are in the low thousands to tens of thousands per day. Block rewards are just over $2 million a day (at $600 prices for BTC). (Back of the napkin calculation: 1440 minutes per day / 10 minute blocks = 144 x 25 BTC block rewards x current price.)
So yes, there needs to be many, many more transaction or higher fees to sustain the level of mining we're seeing now. This is why Bitcoin is designed to slowly taper off mining rewards. The idea is that transactions increase (and so does the price) as block rewards decrease. So far that's been proven true. Check back in 2016 when block rewards drop to 12.5!

The easiest way to learn is to play with it. First you need to get some BTC, even a tiny amount will work. When you do, try this:
1. Go to bitaddress.org.  Generate a public key (an address) and a private key. (It does this automatically.) Print this out.
2. Now transfer a small amount of BTC to the public key. After a few minutes, you'll see the transaction happen on blockchain. (Your life will be easier if you copy and paste the public key for now, but for long-term security you should be more careful)
3. You now have a bitcoin address with a balance of BTC. So, how do we use it/spend it/transfer it? 
4. Try this, go to blockchain.info or another decent online wallet (again, not a good choice for long-term cold storage, you want a pure paper wallet for that.) Import your private key into the wallet. You can scan the QR code with a webcam on blockchain... BAM. Now you have the BTC ready to spend in this wallet.
Those are the basic principles and playing with those elements will help you understand how it works.

This is not directly BTC-related, but it'll get the most interest here... I was wondering what people thought [about the major altcoins.](
I've done a little bit of homework about the subject and based on Andreas Antonopoulos' comments in a recent video it is likely that a handful of the big altcoins will be successful. There won't be only one cryptocurrency in the same way that there isn't one fiat currency.
Some thoughts:
1. Litecoin -- I don't find this very interesting at all. It's a nearly identical copy of BTC with a tweaked proof-of-work and a faster confirmation time. 
2. Peercoin -- Now this is a cool altcoin. I think it has lots of potential, great developers and some innovative features like built-in inflation and deflation mechanisms. The proof-of-stake mining is very compelling. If you haven't read about it you owe it to yourself.
3. Namecoin -- I understand why this is important and interesting but I can't get too excited about it. I probably need to do more research on this one.
4. Nxt -- This is currently the hot, cool new crypto, and it's deserving of the attention it's getting. That said, I don't really buy into the concept of being 100% proof-of-stake. It seems like a strange way to launch a coin with all of the currency issued. The developer's plans for this coin are very ambitious though and it really does seem like a 2nd Generation crypto. Worth watching.

Whatever transaction is received first is the one the network accepts. The second one will be rejected. So no, you still can't double spend. And yes, you're right, the confirmations are created by each new block. The more confirmations, the harder it is to make changes to the blockchain ledger.

Adoption of another cryptocurrency is extremely unlikely. Why? Because of the network effect. (The same reason everyone uses Facebook, even though Facebook is awful). The network effect is only compounded by the fact that cryptocurrencies require a financial investment (unlike, say, moving from Facebook to G+). Also, the Bitcoin protocol itself can be updated as the need arises or if significant technological issues are found. Why would anyone use something else?

That isn't true. Bitcoin is worth whatever you can exchange it for, not just its relationship to fiat. If can trade 1 BTC for $100 in Amazon gift cards, then to many people it's worth $100. If I can trade it for beer at a pub, or food at a restaurant or for any other good and service, it still has value apart from its supposed exchange rate with fiat, which in the case of MtGox, is a complete fantasy right now because of artificial limitations on withdrawals with one major currency.
Only currency traders/speculators would think in terms of "cash you can get in hand immediately." Bitcoin is a robust medium of exchange for many other things. (And I'm not even goign to get into Silk Road...)

Yes, this is theoretically possibly, although very, very unlikely. This is called a 51% attack. Here's what the Bitcoin wiki says:


Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
Reverse other people's transactions
Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
Change the number of coins generated per block
Create coins out of thin air
Send coins that never belonged to him
With less than 50%, the same kind of attacks are possible, but with less than 100% rate of success. For example, someone with only 40% of the network computing power can overcome a 6-deep confirmed transaction with a 50% success rate.
It's much more difficult to change historical blocks, and it becomes exponentially more difficult the further back you go. As above, changing historical blocks only allows you to exclude and change the ordering of transactions. It's impossible to change blocks created before the last checkpoint.
The thing is, at the current hash rate of 500,000 GH/s, you would need over 250,000 GH/s to do this. That's an *insane* amount of computing power. Not even the top three letter agencies could summer that kind of firepower, and even if they did, they really mess things up for awhile but they couldn't destroy Bitcoin for the reasons stated above.
Also, that much computing power would cost an ungodly amount of money and require the better part of a state's electrical grid to run. So it's very unlikely. It would throw a wrench in for a time, but it couldn't destroy the network.

You get charged $10 a month to use an ATM card? WTF?  I've *never* paid a fee like that. You can get most regular checking accounts + ATM cards for free if you setup direct deposit. You can then move your money out the next day if you want to. Usually you don't have to keep a minimum balance.... I would *really* look hard at changing banks.
Also, you shouldn't have to pay an ATM fee if you're using your bank's ATM or sometimes even one on the same general network. Check out Capital One 360 (formerly INGDirect) for a bank that does this right.

This didn't change until the late 90s. Once people actually started using the Internet in mass, it was clear that the only use for the technology wans't creating cess-pools of internet crime and porn hidden away on BBSes.

Bitcoin is volatile NOW, but I doubt it will always be. This is a very, very young technology just beginning to be adopted and still barely understood in the media.
A crypto-currency is a new paradigm and a new technology. Things will be rocky for awhile, we don't know how the market is going to react in the short or medium term. In the long term, assuming it finds ever widening adoption, it will stabilize and slowly rise in price. (Bitcoin will naturally deflate after 2140, that's part of the design.

You need the private key to SPEND the coins. The public key is just for receiving or viewing transactions.
What you do with it, if it's a paper wallet, is keep it somewhere safe. If you're using electrum or another client like that, you'll want to save the SEED that can re-create the wallet and then encrypt and backup the wallet file itself. You won't need to deal with the private keys at all unless you want to.

@_date: 2013-08-19 20:45:32
Exactly. It was designed this way on purpose. The large block rewards early on incentivized miners to help secure the network. (And still do today...) Satoshi believed that by 2025 or 2030, when the rewards all but disappear, there will be enough transaction fees built into the system to pay miners. The market will decide what these fees are.
Every time you send a transaction you can decide what fee to tag on. (A small one is usually included by default in many wallets) Miners can also choose which transactions to include. This means that the free market will determine what fees will eventually become standard to support the network.

Because you're trusting a third party with your money. And you have *no recourse* if the money is stolen. Third parties, even really big, trustworthy, rich ones, get hacked. (Did you see what just happened to Target?)
Create a paper wallet with bitaddress.org, preferably on a computer that has never connected to the internet. Send coins to this paper wallet. Now you basically have a piece of bitcoin "cash" denominated with whatever you sent to the address. It is invulnerable to hacks but can be lost in the same way cash can be. (In a fire, etc.)

@_date: 2013-11-04 15:49:03
This is a good idea, and many do it. That said, you don't really need to have a "vault wallet" exactly.  All you really need to do is create a paper wallet with one or more addresses. (You can use bitaddress.org) When you send coins to these paper addresses they are in "cold storage." If you need to import the private keys to your "hot" wallet at some point you can, but you really shouldn't if you can avoid it.
The cool thing is that you can then add this cold storage address as a "watch only" address on many wallets. (Such as blockchain.info) so you can see your total BTC balance without fear of losing any of your cold storage because the private keys are nowhere but on that piece of paper, in your safety deposit box, or whatever.

From the [Bitcoin Wiki:](
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations

With less than 50%, the same kind of attacks are possible, but with less than 100% rate of success. For example, someone with only 40% of the network computing power can overcome a 6-deep confirmed transaction with a 50% success rate.
It's much more difficult to change historical blocks, and it becomes exponentially more difficult the further back you go. As above, changing historical blocks only allows you to exclude and change the ordering of transactions. It's impossible to change blocks created before the last checkpoint.
Since this attack doesn't permit all that much power over the network, it is expected that no one will attempt it. A profit-seeking person will always gain more by just following the rules, and even someone trying to destroy the system will probably find other attacks more attractive. However, if this attack is successfully executed, it will be difficult or impossible to "untangle" the mess created -- any changes the attacker makes might become permanent.

We've had these crashes before. Several times. Investing in bitcoin is like investing in a dot.com IPO. Huge risk, huge reward. It should be a small part of a portfolio. What I fail to understand is why you would realize losses if you didn't have to.

Try electrum or multibit, seriously. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:08:44
Go to bitaddress.org. Print off a a bitcoin address and private key. You now have paper wallet. You can now send transactions to this address. Practice this a few times. Also practice importing the paper private keys to a live wallet like electrum or multibit. If you want to store any substantial amount of BTC this way it's worth reading up on how to effectively secure your wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:46:33
Valuations vary wildly, but take a look at the value of off shore accounts, the number and size of transactions done by Visa or the market for commodities like gold. BTC competes with all of these existing systems. You can do the math yourself by looking at any of these metrics and asking yourself: "what % of these systems is Bitcoin likely to replace?"

At first, I thought the tipbot was fluff. Now, I think the tipbot may be the greatest invention in the popularization of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:05:35
I think the number is bigger than most people would imagine. There are [over 22 million transactions a day.]( and over [65 thousand unique *addresses* used per day.]( That's more traffic than just a few thousand people would generate. Especially if they're all hoarding.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:17:48
No no no. I would suggest you not do this because the electrum seed is totally random. Any words you choose might not be. Also, the seed isn't really a series of word at all, but a random 128-bit number that is converted to words so that it can be memorized or easily written down. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:34:47
The only answer that has any meaning is this: "Bitcoin is worth what someone will pay for it." 
The market will determine its value over time. Anything else is wild speculation, comparisons to paypal, visa, etc. are all hot air. (Very compelling and interesting hot air, but still meaningless.) We have no idea what Bitcoin is worth and we probably won't for at least a decade - we need massive adoption by merchants and individuals and financial institutions first.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:55:36
The path of least resistance (at least in the US) is coinbase. You can buy at little as $10 at a time I think and it's very easy to set up.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:45:22
What you can and should do is add your paper wallet address as a "watch only" address in your blockchain wallet. (That is, you're adding the address of your paper wallet without any private keys, so it can't be spent.) This will allow you to see all the BTC you control without worrying about theft.
It's very good for peace of mind.
You can always keep a small sum in the online wallet for spending, but use your cold storage address for nothing but storage, don't try and spend it unless you absolutely have to.

If you [go to the link here and sign in to your Google account,]( you'll see a link on the right that says "Move to a different phone."
Edit: Also, you can pre-generate a list of backup verification codes. Keep these somewhere safe, like with your paper wallet. They can get you in to your account even if you lose your phone in the backwoods of China or something.

First mover advantage, the Network Effect, and the fact that the underlying code can and is being updated regularly. Any benefit that a knock-off altcoin adds Bitcoin developers can easily implement. 
There are some interesting altcoins, but they're the ones with significantly different designs and new codebases.

Investing in bitcoin can be compared to investing in the IPO of a dot.com company. High risk, high reward. Call it what you want, but panic selling isn't going to gain you anything, in fact, it will guarantee loss.

I hear you, but mining in 2011 =/= to mining in 2013. With live in an ASIC world now. You either had early access to heavy duty hardware or you didn't. In the latter case, I can't see mining makes any financial sense.

There are powerful forces aligned against online file sharing too. But P2P networks have proven their reliance over and over again. How many millions has the RIAA spent trying to shut down Bittorrent? How many laws, like the DMCA have been passed? But it ain't gonna happen.

So if we're over 460 in February I will look prescient? Please do save it. I wish I had more to invest at $460 or $500.

I hate how they describe mining. "Using computers and complex software, people can “mine” Bitcoins by solving complex mathematical problems. If they solve the problem, they get Bitcoin."
While technically true, it misses the point that miners are what secure the network.

Why would you do this? That's insane. Why not just hold it for a month or two? In February you're gonna have some regrets man.

This makes a lot more sense to me than the OP. That said, I think your final paragraph is the most likely. Google did not create Bitcoin but was very sympathetic to it early in development. This would have happened naturally anyway given who works at Google, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened at a quietly official level as well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:56:10
Dude, no one has ANY IDEA what the valuation of BTC should be. That's why it's so volatile.  The underlying technology has proven, time and again, to be bulletproof.  Come check back in in 6 months and see what's up then.

This is the most important takeaway from the article. Only 4% of transactions came from SilkRoad. That's a really, really good thing.

Electrum offers many advantages over Qt. You should check it out.
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:39:15
...or to a paper wallet you generate on bitaddress.org.
The cool thing I learned about this is that you can create a "watch only" address on blockchain.info, so you can still see the BTC balance in your cold storage easily but without having the private keys imported. This is the best of both worlds IMHO.
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:07:55
[There are 400k people just with Blockchain wallets.]( My guess is that you're being conservative. The number of active users could easily be twice that or more.

That was so well said. Austrian Economics in a nutshell.

You realize you don't have to do that right? There are lightweight clients like Electrum and Multibit that don't require the entire blockchain. You only need to sync if you want to run a full node.
But to get to the root of your question, no it's not really an issue. [HDD capacity is increasing and cost is decreasing at exponential, Moore's Law levels.]( The size of the blockchain is so small a problem it's insignificant.

@_date: 2013-11-05 04:06:09
One really nice new feature in this release is the ability to see the balance of each address in the wallet. Before, in 1.8, it used to lump them all together and you didn't know how much BTC was in any particular address. Now the "receive" tab displays both the balance and the number of transactions. 
Edit: It also displays change addresses. Awesome.

Nobody has any idea what it's worth. But over a 10-20 year timeline I think it has one of the largest potential payoffs of any investment you could make. Think of it like a dot.com IPO. It could be fantastically valuable. It could also be worth nothing. 
I had a friend who worked in Silicon Valley startups and was often paid in stock options, or, as he described it "I was paid in lottery tickets."

We're talking about an open source implementation of SHA-256. There's no possibility of backdoors. There's also no way that current hardware could crack it unless you think the NSA have something from an alien space ship.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:05:56


This is a technicality, but you really just import the private key. The public key can be derived from the private key so importing both is never necessary. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:56:07
If I had made a major investment (I wish...) I would probably set a plan to cash some of it out at various price points. You want to hedge your bet. You can always keep some BTC in reserve as your "OMG Bitcoin is worth $10,000" fund.

@_date: 2013-12-23 19:52:01


Yes, but right now block rewards incentivize mining regardless of fees. Miners get paid in newly mined BTC primarily and the transaction fees are just icing on the cake.
Miners can and do accept only the transactions they want to accept. Right now free transactions are still processed, just slightly slower than those with fees, but in the future you'll need to include a fee if you don't want to wait forever.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:09:23
I don't think it makes much of a differnece. So what? If someone manages to get past Google 2FA and into my Drive, what difference does it make if they see a wallet.dat and a horses_eating_apples.avi file? They're both encrypted. It's not like it's going to be easy to crack either one.
Although now that I'm thinking about it, I'm renaming my wallet file to something like Charles_Dickens_English_101.doc. Security through obscurity FTW!

Which, by definition, is not "money you can afford to lose."
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:26:31
Yes. I have and do invest in the stock and bond markets. Bitcoin is a small, speculative part of a much broader portfolio. That's why I don't understand panic selling and realizing losses. The outcome of Bitcoin over the long-term (5+ years) is essentially binary: massive adoption and success or near total marginalization. I treat it the same way I would treat a dot.com IPO (and I was an early investor in AMZN). You might as well go long.
It's the panic selling at a loss that I don't understand.
