Perfect, thanks.

Ok doing a little more research on this I can see that the confirmed is only to ensure the coins are not spent again on a different node, is that right? From what I gather this is quite a difficult scam to pull off and probably not applicable to small sales in real life? Also would the fact that two people are in the same part of the world the confirmation process would be a little faster?

I suppose that's what I'm trying to get my head around. The transaction seems near instant. It's the confirmations that seem to take time. Presumably the risk at something like a local market is minimal really?

my btc was right but I lost a small amount of dollars

Sorry still trying to get my head around it all. So the competing block is the double spend scenario?
When you say the block builders can refuse the transaction, I thought the transaction will eventually be processed even without a transaction fee, just much much slower?
I suppose what I'm trying to work out is the risk a market trader would be letting himself in for. I understand there are scenarios where the transaction might not work but some people are implying this risk is tiny?
[Edit] From bitcoin.org - "If there are 10 generating nodes that never require a transaction fee and your client is modified to never send any transaction fee, then your transactions will eventually be picked up by one of those free nodes when they generate a block, though it will probably take a very long time."

I think for the case of a market in the real world where consistent attacks couldn't be automated, the chance of non payment is rare enough not to worry about?
I can definitely see the advantage to the trust system though. I think one of the big advantages to bitcoin is instant transfer of coins.

I'm new to bitcoins and very interested in the whole concept. The animation and video are excellent and some well written articles. This podcast puts me right off. I get the idea of some geek in his basement saying "oooh, oooh, lets start our own nation"

Didn't realise it was your podcast, sorry didn't mean to be insulting. It's easy to criticize and difficult to create well. If you are going to discuss "out there" concepts might be worth your while getting someone to discuss with you on the podcast, to give a counter argument? Just a suggestion.

Excellent, thanks. My account is still intact and no suspicious logins.

I for one don't bother with the forums so no harm asking here.

Nice one. Ta.

I bought 100 at 80 cents and have spent 75 of them in the early days showing people how it works. Ah well, still have about $3500 worth to get excited about.

I got my coins out but wanted to take my cash out to coupons so I could trade on bitcoin-24.com but that option seems to have been removed. Worrying.
