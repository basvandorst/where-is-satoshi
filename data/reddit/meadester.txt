You could argue that if everyone in the world (or even everyone in one country) knows about bitcoins and can use them for *all* of their monetary needs, then whoever is still foolish enough to hold fiat currency gets what they deserve. The state printing money to pay its expenses would still be taking value from currency holders, but then at least you could say they were willing victims. However, now and for the foreseeable future, most people need to use fiat currency or make their lives unbearably difficult (even before bitcoins most people could use barter but for the vast majority it was impractical). 
In any case, you cannot say that the state printing money to pay expenses is not taking value from someone else, regardless of how willing that someone might be. It is in fact a tax of the sneakiest and most dishonest kind, because people don't see the purchasing power they lose until after the fact.

Coinbase. No problems for me personally but there would be if I was a day trader as their buy orders have been delayed for several days lately. No delays for sell orders, though.

I hadn't really thought of it that specifically. There certainly is a point where psychological fuckery becomes psychological torture. I don't know where that line is so I don't know if what they have done officially constitutes torture, but I would be surprised if they didn't at least deprive him of sleep enough to cause temporary psychosis. If he has any phobias, I am sure they have been used against him in a way to cause maximum trauma as well. 
As for physical torture, you are probably right that it would be difficult for them to do without some leaving some trace of physical evidence. So the risk of using them would outweigh the reward, especially when they can get the same results with social isolation (solitary confinement) and the methods I mentioned above.

I *was* happy until I read:




Some attitude for a company calling itself "Liberty City Ventures".

Or they tortured him. That's not a joke, I really wouldn't put that past them.

FTFY: Or, you know, the tens of thousands of people who are killed by drug lords all across Latin America just so American politicians can get their fix of power by maintaining laws based on ignorance.

No? Then what did you mean by this?

So, creating money out of thin air, with nothing of value to back it up, doesn't take away from any one? Are you saying that bondholders and people with savings accounts or holding cash reserves are not harmed by inflation, or that governments printing as much money as they desire, to pay for whatever they can imagine, doesn't cause inflation? 
Do you think counterfeiting should be legal? If not, why not, by your logic it doesn't harm anyone, as long as the counterfeit currency is not discovered to be counterfeit. And if it is discovered, people could just treat it like the real thing and keep circulating it as such.

I guess you're right. There is no way I could get the idea that the U.S. government tortures people besides from movies.
