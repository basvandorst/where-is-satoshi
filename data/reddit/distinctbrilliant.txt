Read what i wrote again. I did not claim that a payment is considered an asset. I said if trading and payments represent an income for you, it is taxed. If you find out an bitcoin wallet and exchange it, it CAN BE considered an "Mais Valia" aka an asset.

Im Portuguese. It clearly says if it represents an professional activity for you it is taxed. The problem is, if you make money every month with trading it will be considered an professional activity.

Lmao, try to ride a bicycle in Lisbon. You can ride bicycles in cities like Amsterdam because the ground is mostly flat. Lisbon is literally an mountain with buildings xD Btw, the center of Lisbon is a working place, 99,5% of the people that work in Lisbon lives 10km + away.

The first thing you should do is inform yourself buddy ahah This has been a myth for a long time. Portugal do tax crypto trading and payments if it represents an income for you.

In that case:
1. Portugal doesn't tax crypto holders YET, because they haven't updated laws related to crypto. (Portugal as always will follow European laws).
2. You do pay taxes if you didn't hold more than 1 year.

Obviously there is company's offering bicycle rides for tourists to enjoy the flat ground close to the Tejo River. I mean, try to ride a bicycle every working everyday in center of Lisbon. If you can do it, you are ready to compete in Tour de France.

I mean that it is true that you can open an business in 1 hour, but the same time frame to get law problems for having a ''weak company setup".

Not true, gains obtained by selling crypto can be considered an asset sell income and be taxed up to 50%. Most people think crypto it's not taxed because they have been selling it without declaring to the Tax Authority and get away with it.

This is not true. Portugal do tax trading and payments if it represents an income for you. The only exception is if you find an old wallet with crypto and exchange it for fiat. But even if that happens, Portugal Tax Authority will run after you and claim it as an asset while asking for a good percentage (can go up to 50%). Portugal is one of the most taxed countries in Europe. Source: Im Portuguese.
