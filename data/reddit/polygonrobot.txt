Not sure how successful this experiment will be, but I'm willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt. (The btcsuite devs have done good work so far)

- Only if you have cheap electricity.
I highly recommend it if you want to support the network and learn something cool. It taught me a lot about how Bitcoin works.

This was one of my favorite talks.

It wouldn't make sense. ASICs are far more advanced and specialized. ASIC chips have a single purpose, hash double SHA256. The iPhone 6 includes a multi-purpose chip which is expensive and complex. 
It could be an interesting side project.

**Short answer is yes, hashrate will still be important.**
Without going into crazy detail, hashrate influences the network difficulty. Every 2,016 blocks the difficulty adjusts, it will either increase or decrease, depending on the overall network hashrate. 
Goal is to consistently generate blocks every 600 seconds (10min). This block mechanism will continue to function the same as we sail past 21 million. [This graphic might help](
Someone feel free to include more detail.

I think this piece is very important. Bitcoin's value is dependent on it's functionality. It's not an "energy waste" if we find it's functionality valuable.

Get an Antminer S3. They're quiet but it makes the room 10 degrees hotter. Also don't expect to make ROI, it should only be for fun and learning.
