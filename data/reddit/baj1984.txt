I don't know whether to buy more or wait until the crash. It seems foolish buying at such a high, but then some predictions are saying 2k

Not everyone sees it as an anarchist revolt. Some people see it as just another payment method, and I worry that by lumping this whole anarchist movement with it will prevent wider adoption.
