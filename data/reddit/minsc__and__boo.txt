Pi is a mathematical inevitability in a base 10 numerical system.
Bitcoins are just 1's and 0's, and one of many cryptocurrencies. Don't fool yourself into thinking it's pi or calculous or carl sagan reborn or "Jesus".
It matters how much of the market they control because currencies are susceptible to liquidity issues.

Serious question: How do you file your taxes? Is each paycheck another barter form?

So you now acknowledge motives are relevant?
Considering the motives are unknown it hasn't been priced into the market yet. 
Bitcoins are an imperfect market, but you knew that right along with the glorious power of pi, right?

What I find amazing is your propensity to be so emotionally invested.  You've managed to sound bitter while replying to a 3-day old comment, in a thread not on the front page of this sub, leading me to believe that you sought this comment out just to argue with it.
And you didn't even contribute anything to the discussion.  You rephrased a sentence out of context, which made sense in context.  Bitcoins have recessionary behavior, exactly like gold.  That was the point - that with this characteristic it doesn't make a good currency.
As for the rest - you commit the same fallacy as the person ahead of you, except instead of equivocating bitcoins with pi, you equivocate it with the internet.  Next you will equivocate it with mobile or whatever other successful thing you can cherry pick to fit your own narrative.
The overall tone and lax mental investment of your comment demonstrates that you've probably invested heavily in bitcoins.  I hope you investment more of your faculties in being unbiased your future financial decisions - more so than you just did in your comment.

You're confusing assets with currency.  Bitcoins are hoarded now, just like how people hoard gold.  And just how national currencies decoupled from gold because of its liquidity issues, bitcoins will never become mainstream for the same reason.
Cryptocurrencies are definitely the future, just not the implementation called bitcoins.

Investors watch CEOs to see if they sell stock - any stock - because it signifies confidence in the equity.
Satoshi isn't really a CEO but by even selling one bitcoin it sends a signal to the market.

Equivocation fallacy, and super obvious at that.
The motives of the liquidity controllers dictate whether bitcoins or some other cryptocurrency become mainstream. You don't understand finance, do you? Power motives play a huge role in investor (even participatory user) confidence....

Yeah, I remember mine too. It was at dinner and someone had invited a friend of a friend who was a real piece of work.
Sure enough he brought that shit up about how bitcoin prices were making progress, etc, and I told him he shouldn't bet on it becoming a future currency because of volatility and transaction problems. 
I may as well have insulted his religion because he spent the rest of the night trying to verbally attack me. Even after I had figured out that it was an uncomfortable subject for people at the table and had changed it, this guy kept interrupting other people who were talking to me (including my GF) to make snide remarks.
He kept drilling me with questions about when I had used bitcoin, about what type of GPU I had used to mine way back in 2010, and where I had rented a PO box to get drugs delivered - like maybe he could find a chink in my story and say I made it all up or some shit. He accused me of being a bitcoin hipster, like people who say "Burning man used to be cool." I told him that you don't invest in burning man, and that I wouldn't have advised anyone to invest in housing in 2008 either.
In any case, my GF and I get home later and the douche sent us Facebook friend requests.  We both had a laugh and noped the hell out of it.

The government will just gerrymander their borders until it has found its people.

Mobile website apps are a thing, you know.

Pushing a hard fork for anything other than security-breaking fixes proves bitcoin is just like other centralized currencies.

It can throw a 500 if the cookie data is stale/corrupted and nobody wrote error handling for it on the server side.  Could be from the user intentionally fucking with the cookie or there is a browser extension that is messing with a validation .js script, etc.

Right but every member of a society can't become an electronic security expert, hence specialization and risk deference.
My debit number was stripped from a compromised reader (we assume), and in less than 4 hours my bank had put a hold on my card and called me about suspicious purchases. Because of insurance I got all of my money back a week later. 
The point is that we should be conscious of our security, but there should be services in place to increase trust in your purchasing habits (i.e. so we don't have to test every reader before we use it).
