Thanks for the info. I've heard good things about Keepkey! What are you using?

The mixed signals would be the "Well it *can* be worth it in pools" opinions I've read, but I'm seeing that the overwhelming opinion is to not mine. Which is great, less work for me.  ;P  Now I just need to figure out how to invest my income most wisely.

How much would you say a solid investment is, then? I know the rule is "Don't spend what you can't lose". 
Also, do you think I should just dump one of my work-at-home incomes into that?

That's a really good point, I should just treat it like a part of my retirement savings portfolio.

I'm a freelance writer, and handle some social media accounts for local businesses. Those are my steady gigs, at least. I do a few "beer money" projects here and there, as well.

Thanks! I keep remembering reading a thread on PF a long time ago about some money-strapped Redditor who suddenly remembered he had over 950 bitcoin sitting in a wallet he had forgotten about (that, at the time, was valued at over 1 million USD).

This was the sort of answer I was looking for, thank you. I'm really appreciating all of the feedback I'm getting from everyone, this sub seems really supportive!  :)
Now to figure out how *much* to buy...

The mixed signals I guess would be the "it *can* be worth it in pools" information. 
What are altcoins worth, currently?

That seems pretty sound, I throw pretty much all of my 2nd and 3rd income(s) into savings and investments.
