Hello, thank you for thoses information. How did you actually get them back ? You just contacted the owner ?
It's funny because I still have his name/email in my mailbook because back in the days I discussed with him about a logo for his website. I tried to reach him by email several times but no answer

I wonder on what data you base your prediction ;)

I'm not brother, if they're lost / stolen what can I do anyway ?
But if someone has any other information about this website, like how to retrieve them, I would appreciate and will give you 30% of my total bitcoins :-)

lol please keep selling, I bought a few more bitcoins thanks to them
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:42:46
I can't believe people are still so worried about the price. Why don't you guys enjoy your bitcoins to actually buy thing in bitcoins ? Do something usefull instead of worrying
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:20:57
Or you can stop being that dumb-lambo guy and just spend your bitcoin on online commidity like every sane investor

Yet another brainwashed bitch...

Why are people panicking ?
Why don't you fucking use your Bitcoin into something useful instead of waiting to sell for stupid fiat? If you want money go make it, stop waiting for crypto to get you richer, it won't happen with that mindset.
Jeez I can't believe how many mongoloid are on crypto since the Bitcoin boom last year. And I'm here spending my bitcoins on product online, I feel alone sometime.

I meant, alone in spending my 2694 remaining Bitcoins
