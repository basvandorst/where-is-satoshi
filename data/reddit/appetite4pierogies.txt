Why is the "full adoption" scenario here assumed to be just BTC? BTC is getting destroyed in terms of total marketcap by alts recently, Tx slow/expensive... why would anyone in their right mind choose BTC over the numerous promising projects out there that don't have the baggage BTC does? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:35:33


Currently it is not capable of disrupting either of those, while alt-coin projects have active partnerships with... financial services and remittances companies.

You're suggesting that people with no disposable income won't work harder with a taste of disposable income and the prospect of getting more? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:15:39
This is just circular logic. The price going up = consensus, and consensus leads to the price going up... 
If your only measure of the merits of Bitcoin is its price, you're in for a rude awakening when the lack of any real utility and retarded level of energy consumption from PoW catch up with its value, because a lot of idiots as well as "bitcoin purists" will be stuck holding the bag
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:45:02


And instead hold a highly volatile speculative asset! Voila!

I've read and discussed Austrian economics both in an academic setting and on reddit for years. Enough to know that its adherents on Reddit, are mostly edgy dipshits who seem to believe that the market can solve every externality (retarded)

How so? It basically just takes issue with the comparison to Nigeria; the amount of energy used in mining is absolutely absurd, and short of 100% renewable, is completely unsustainable. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:17:33


Yeah, you see this is retarded because of this little thing called the hydrological cycle 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:13:50
Enron is a good example of why you're universal principle of how "insider trading can't be bad" is dumb.  Keep eating from the trashcan of ideology tho
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:31:37
This doesn't address the fact that the amount of energy required for each mining transaction is absurdly huge. 
Furthermore, the article claims "the amount of household electricity consumed by stand-by devices" is 25% without providing a source. I haven't been able to verify this claim independently, and the author neglects to mention that standby power is indeed regulated.

There are tons of anti-meat groups, vegans, vegetarians etc. who don't eat meat specifically for this reason. What rock do you live under? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:19:03


Eat a dick

So a bunch of Friedman fanboys, no ladies and cheap blow? Sounds like a party
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:15:12
Yeah sure, I agree crypto could be big. Its just really funny/alarming/sad to see people treating it like a panacea to every economic problem, while they just sit and watch the price in hopes of cashing out and getting rich.

Ancaps love uncle Milton I thought 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:29:33
There's a lot of ignorance on how infrastructure and public services come to be wrapped up in there, as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:03:45


Lol this shows what you think about anarchism. The freedom for whites to impose themselves on women, blacks and natives. Gender and racial hierarchies... SOOO anarchist. You retard
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:07:03
Lol I work 50-60 hour weeks and exceed the "healthy" % of income you should spend on rent.
if anything, UBI would motivate me more, because I wouldn't just be busting my ass to afford to live where I can find work. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:08
Not if it completely tanked lmao

Rich people feel superduper fucking smart for trying to avoid taxes. I have spoken to a number of people who will swear by their tax avoidance, claiming it is what any reasonable person would do. While ignoring that we don't have any public services or infrastructure (that they use) without taxes
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:57:23
Speak English you nerd lmao
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:38
Yes but those are used by people to deposit and withdraw cash they use to purchase goods/services. Bitcoin not so much...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:16
doesn't mean people have to support this fuckface or his shitcoin for it. 
You are retarded
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:48:43
Libertarians are dumb. There's your explanation. At least the majority of them
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:02:24
Scholars at the Mises institute are fucking retarded though lmao. Ancaps always cite this garbage and handwave away the mountains of criticism. I guess thats fine because anarcho capitalism really only is for losers
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:08:32
people don't want to get fucked over because people are trading on privileged information and colluding to manipulate markets. 
Libertarians are R E T A R D E D if they don't think that is bad
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:10:38
Considering it is largest contributor to GHGs, yes, plenty of people I know specifically do not eat meat because of the environmental implications of beef (you also the food/water intensity of livestock, contaminated water, land use concerns rolled up in there) 
Personally, it is what is driving my meat consumption down considerably. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:59
Because you're an idiot

Lol profiting of your users with insider knowledge should definitely be a crime dawg
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:49:59
I'd be fine with that. Most I know would consider forcing companies to be transparent as a violation of their rights. Most libertarian ideology boils down to "might makes right", or at least that is the logical conclusion
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:40:36
The article is about bitcoin price manipulation, what you are quoting is the scope of oversight of CFTC, which is working with the SEC. That isn't referencing the scope of this probe. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:46:13
Lol keep it up with the mindless platitudes. Are you really this dumb? 
So if the FDA prevents companies from selling you rat poison poptarts, are they actually limiting your freedom to consume poisoned pastries? Muh liberty. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:23:26
It's not a false comparison, the essence of it is the same. The government is protecting [consumers/investors] from the negative consequences of being misled or deceived into [purchasing/consuming] something that will lead them to [financial/physical] harm
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:38:54
Bitcoin doesn't let you be your own bank, anyone who says that is literally retarded
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:45:23
Seemingly many people are unaware of all the manipulation and shadiness of exchanges, and probably would not have bought in if they knew what was really happening. As an advocate of decentralization and transparency, you should welcome shining light on these practices lmao
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:36:01
This is absolutely retarded and why no one will ever use Bitcoin for fucking anything. OP is retarded for going to this length to do something with a  negative utility, and anyone who reads his entire post is almost as retarded. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:01:39
Oh so you are that dumb, got it. Not like any company has ever sold products that were dangerous to conusmers. It should be the consumers responsibility to test products for their authenticity, adulterants and possible harmful chemicals. Gotcha 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:02:22
What? The fact that I'm not so delusional I can see that bitcoin markets are massively manipulated and all the dipshit retail investors \(like you\) need protection means I'm from 4chan? ok bub
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:24:26
What the fuck are you even talking about? lol we are talking about people manipulating the price of an asset using exchanges, the code behind Bitcoin is entirely irrelevant you lame nerd
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:38:05
Lmao you are fucking retarded 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:35:44
To protect idiots from being separated from their money? Care to read the article? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:05:06
I mean you can believe what you want, I'm just taken aback by all the incredulity given that this is a community of people who dumped large chunks of cash into a risky speculative investment that they will only make money on if other people blindly follow them, while insisting to eachother that it MUST GO UP IN PRICE!! 
Geez. If you people are dumb enough to fall for this and shitpost these dumb memes all day, I don't think it should be that far out of the realm of possibility for you to accept this story as true. Cuz it is. Asshole
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:02:12
How is it made up and ridiculous? Are you so cynical that you refuse to acknowledge a 12 year old might be interested in Bitcoin and knows a crypto meme? A Japanese 12 year old at that. 
And you are acting like people are gullible for upvoting this when you are probably also gullible enough to be heavily invested in Bitcoin. lol
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:59:52
