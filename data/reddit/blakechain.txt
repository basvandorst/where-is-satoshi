Seven Hundred Thousand Satoshi!

Easiest way to do internal finances I can think of is to set up a new HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet for the business. Use the main seed/master key to manage all the sub accounts, and have each department/cost center as a child under the master. Control over the master key/seed lets the business control all child addresses, and each department can generate its own children, both for incoming and outgoing transactions. 
Both electrum and armory (among others) have HD wallets, and you can decide what service best suits the business needs to balance usability vs. security vs. disaster recovery.
Let me know if you want more info. Good luck!

This sounds great! Should work on iOS as well, right?

Thanks for posting this! Sorry I missed the demo tonight... See you at the next one.

[This wiki]( has a good explanation of the bitcoin mining algorithm. The complex problem the miners try and solve is to find a sha256 hash digest with a bunch of leading 0s. The number of 0s required is specified by the mining difficulty target which updates about every two weeks to try and keep the average time between blocks about 10 minutes. Once the problem has been solved by one miner, that computer broadcasts the solution to the rest of the network. The validity of the solution is easy to confirm and therefore takes a basically trivial amount of time. But finding the solution in the first place can only be done by brute forcing a bunch of different inputs into the hashing algorithm--hence, proof of work.

That's what I was thinking, but thanks for confirming and providing the link!

Ok now we're talking. So the public key would be visible in the input section of the transaction which spends the coins, right? Along with the signature which corresponds with that public key. So then we could use ECIES to encrypt the message for the address holder's eyes only. Am I getting that all right?

Thanks for your reply!

Thanks for the link--this is helpful.

Hi Bruce, thanks for speaking out to the community about the problems you're seeing and working to regain the public trust through honesty and openness. I'd like to ask what measures of financial and organizational transparency you plan to bring to the Foundation. Do you plan to make financials public--either by posting on the site or a third party like guidestar? What can you do to make Foundation meetings more open to the membership?
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:54:46
Haha was trying to see if a change to my Adobe chrome extension had taken effect
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:52:02
Ugh that's BS! They didn't back it up?
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:35:34
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:36:05
Lol what have you been searching for!?
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:39:44
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:32:37
Never give up!
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:19:43
Sure. PM me with the details
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:00:09
Haha this is awesome! Am I too late to the Satoshi party?
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:17:06
The fifth result and the first result in pdf format?  Someone did good work!
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:10:12
I've never used your site, but it sounds cool--I spend quite a bit on Starbucks. How does one fund a purchase? Is changetip involved?
@_date: 2015-04-15 11:48:04
Thanks for the reply. Some boards that I've worked with have made most of the business conducted during their board meetings public and have published minutes recapping what was discussed. For confidential matters the board asks everyone attending in person or by video conference to leave and goes into the "executive session" portion of the meeting.  They still publish minutes of the executive session, but the minutes are vague, e.g. Discussion of a potential partnership or talked with counsel about a legal matter. I believe this is standard Robert's Rules of Order practice. 
This level of additional transparency may help quell criticisms of the community and show the Foundation has nothing to hide and is working for the best interests of the membership.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:30:03
That may be the case, lol. Thanks for the tip! It's the first one I've successfully collected after setting up my changetip account. Interesting amount--wonder what moniker that relates to...
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:15:40
OpenBazaar is probably what you're looking for, but it's still in beta.

You got me there! ☺
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:51:24
True dat 
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:16:18
Thanks for investigating further! Seems legit
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:26:28
Nice, thanks for the link. This looks interesting. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:32:01
Thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:39:28
I need an intervention!
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:43:46
Yikes that sucks! What happened if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:53:28
Hmm I thought I was incognito but apparently not
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:25:29
Anyone know the stats on what popular subs don't see much changetip action? I'll make some happen!
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:40:12
Thanks, Bruce!
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:35:02
So you had 21 links for pdf readers, wikis etc referencing pdfs before one result in the format? Fascinating!
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:32:14
@_date: 2015-04-30 02:54:36
This is wrong. Bitcoin loses are reported on schedule D as a capital loss not schedule A.   Sauce, I'm a CPA in Virginia. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:12:32
Thanks! I'm gonna give it a try today!

First mover advantage means it has the largest network effects and market cap at the moment. Also since the protocol can be changed with the consensus of the mining network, any significant advantage that another cryptocurrency may have could likely be co-opted. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 11:24:53
You're welcome! There are definitely some cool network effect when your suppliers and funders start tagging their own addresses -- transparency begets more transparency. I could imagine non profits and political campaigns which are willing to provide this data as being more attractive to donors since the donors would have real time access to financial info and they would be able to confirm what was being spent on overhead vs program spending or verify that a candidate is spending donations legally etc. If there's any way I can help let me know -- good luck!
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:16:33
I love the idea of the blockchain enabling non-profits and governments to be radically transparent to their benefactors and constituents. Not sure how to answer your question but here's $1 for the cause !
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:00:55
Very cool. Congrats!
