I'm sure there were some small commercial miners that did in fact use NiceHash. However with the larger commercial mining farms it is far more economical pay someone to write your own software that monitors the profitability (scrape the stats off WhatToMine) and automatically switch the mining software running to mine the most profitable coin and have an employee trade those coins to BTC/Fiat.

Ah yeah, for sure a lot of commercial miners already do just that. I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'why would the situation be any different than with bitcoins' though?

There are many videos on YouTube that can explain all those things way better than I ever could. Here is one that goes over the basics:

No problem man, i'm happy to help! I personally haven't mined using ASIC's like Antminer but i've done some research on the basics.
From what I could find they seem to be quite profitable and can get you your return on investment within a few months which is typically faster than mining altcoins with GPU's. **HOWEVER**, there are 3 main problems I found with it:
1) Antminers are basically impossible to purchase at retail price without waiting months to get them on a preorder. They end up being sold at 4-5 times their price on places like Ebay and at that price make your actual ROI well over a year. So why not just go through with the pre-order at the retail price? The thing with mining is that the difficulty can increase drastically within the space of just a month and by the time you receive it, the difficulty of mining bitcoin with that ASIC may mean it's no longer profitable. Besides, if it is still profitable it would make more sense to just sell it on Ebay and quadruple your investment instantly. Antminer may have also released a new, more powerful miner which further increases the difficulty due to all the extra hashing power in the system. With GPU mining, if the difficulty of mining 1 coin goes up you can always just start mining a different coin.
2) They are extremely loud. Like between 80 dBA (hairdryer) and 90dBA (lawn mower) loud. Most people keep GPU mining rigs on 24/7 in their houses and I know I sure as hell won't be able to sleep with a lawn mower on inside my house.
3) They have no value outside of their sole purpose of mining Bitcoin. With GPU's miners always have the fallback of being able to sell their hardware to people looking to use it for gaming. With Antminer however, they tend to become pretty worthless once they get a few generations old, so you better hope you've mined enough Bitcoin to recover the initial purchase price.
Do bear in mind though that all of the above is just my opinion formed from the research I did when I too was interested in mining Bitcoin. When I started mining alt-coins many people were saying then was not a good time to start but I did anyway and it has turned out to be quite lucrative so don't let me tell you it's not worth it, just make sure you do your own research.
Good luck dude!

Yup, thats exactly what mining farms like [Genesis]
 ( have been doing. These farms are the main reason graphics cards were sold out and overpriced for ages.

I actually used to mine eth for a few months when I started out but because of the difficulty increases my earnings kept falling so I decided to check out other coins. I found NiceHash and so gave it a go (used an external wallet so only lost about $70 from the hack, phew!). With NiceHash the 2 most profitable algorithms for the 580's were daggerhashimoto (AKA ethash for mining eth) and cryptonight (for mining monero). The only difference between the two was that mining ethereum used WAY more electricity which I pay quite a lot for ($0.15/kWh) and even more when dual mining.
It might have been and probably still is ever so slightly more profitable to dual mine ethereum + decred but it was the middle of the summer when I swapped and the less energy the rig uses, the cooler my house stayed and the less stress the cards are under also increases their longevity.

Just use your GPU to mine when you aren't using it and you will be able to get a new GPU every year for free with the profits from mining. Like this it doesn't matter if your GPU won't live for 3+ years because you will already have a new one. And how is a 6 year old GPU useful for anything other than creating heat?

From my experience with my 2 rigs for the past few months (1 with RX 580's the other with 1070's) I would say the following:
-|RX 580|GTX 1070
Mining Software|Claymore|EWBF
Mining Pool|Nanopool|Nanopool
Daily Earnings|~$2.46|~$3.20
The only issue with mining Monero to Nanopool is that the minimum payout is 0.3 XMR (~80$) (default is 1 XMR but you can lower it!), however there is a fixed fee of 0.013 XMR (~$3.50) for every payout. So basically unless you want to pay a ~4% fee on top of the 1% pool fee, you are incentivized to increase the payout threshold (Sounds familiar to a certain company right? lol).
Though I would certainly recomend mining Zcash with Nvidia GPU's to Nanopool. The minimum payout is only 0.01 ZEC (~$3.20) with no withdrawal fees and only a 1% pool fee.
As for setting up the mining software, just follow the instructions on the Nanopool help pages:
There are other altcoins that sometimes become more profitable than XMR and ZEC but their profitability tends to fluctuate a LOT more and you won't be able to use the larger more trustworthy pools. If you still want to get your earnings in BTC you can just open an account on an exchange and mine to those addresses and trade XMR and ZEC to BTC.

All depends on what hardware (Graphics cards mainly) they have, if they even have graphics cards at all.

Not entirely sure dude, the GPU in my main PC is super old and not worth doing lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:08
Yeah i've seen people getting upwards of 500 on 1070's but it all depends on a lot of other stuff e.g. What manufacturer, what memory the card came with (Samsung/Micron/other), what the other specs of the system are, how far you are willing to overclock etc.

They only support Bitcoin mining with ASICs and not altcoin mining with GPU's.
