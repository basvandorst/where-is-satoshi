We seriously still need to do this? Okay, sigh..
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:03:26
Don't most people have sell orders? Especially near this highly volatile time?

Hey man, Satoshi here. Core is better. You can reference this comment when discussing further steps.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:57:17
Fuck, yawn some more!
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:04:38
Well we are all experts here, 
aren't we?
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:40:12
No, you should dumb everything you have. It will help your profits by buying high and selling low. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:23:45
The price drop was kinda caused by China news, again.. Try to study the price of btc over the past couple months and years and look for patterns. They are there and they will happen again and again.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:09:57
And that is why?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:50:47
Read the comment BELOW your comment, thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:43:14
Multiple accs yet asking about fundamentals month ago. Ok
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:28:57
Well the thing is, the fork doesn't even have to happen. Or it does and is hugely adopted and then the price crashes. Or people just sell their free currency for altcoins and they'll grow. Or maybe everyone suddenly everyone dumps their life savings into bitcoin and the price goes beyond 50k. Who the fuck can predict any of those real scenarios?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:27:06
Lmao @ this sub..
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:04
So what? Stop dwelling on a name and start thinking about actual uses. As I can see you got into crypto when, two months ago? You have no freaking idea what is going on. Stop acting like you do, you have so much research to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:33:17
So why isn't this sub called Bitcoin: Money of the future by corporations for corporations? Because you will never admit it is true. Sit your punk ass down and read about some things instead of just spewing bullshit everywhere
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:19:30
Oh heeeell no.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:50:22
No, you are talking out of your ass. The next projected btc difficulty adjustment is around then, little earlier with this mush hashing power in it. After that it will take ANOTHER 2016 btc blocks to adjust difficulty again. If big chunk of hash goes away from bitcoin somewhere else there won't be enough power to keep the legacy chain going and it may enter some sort of a death spiral. It's a tinfoil hat theory but if it does go through oh boy, am I rich as shit...

Nah ur just mad a burrito makes better financial decisions than you do. And when someone reacts to your username, you answer. Bitch this is Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:19:48
Or, if this situation occurs after Nov 26th, she might be pretty happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:17:07
Wait, it's way too early in the morning here... The one below the guy saying stuff about miners forking...
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:31:33
Yap, been on that bch train for a couple of days now..
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:08:49
Only felt the gains so far ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:49:08
Why should I give a fuck? Oh and Ms. Northern Lights is doing very well, thanks for asking. :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:58:04
Sanity or crypto. Pick one, not both. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:06:48
What was the price again when we were done with plummeting?
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:32:44
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:41:09
1 btc is 100 000 000 satoshi. Do some fucking math 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:06:36
Take a look at some market caps. You can see that there is about 44 billion USD in BTC right now. If/when more people and real players come into the field, the market cap may soar who knows where. Thanks to limited supply of bitcoins, each will be valued accordingly to the market cap.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:09:19
I'm curious, are those just numbers you wish to see btc hit or is there any reasoning behind it?
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:45:19
But the market cap is going doooown

No one told us what to value gold at. It's just the value we are willing to pay for it at any given time. Why is btc deflationary? Reward in bitcoin is not supposed to be countable so you can't really say that it only rewards early adopters. The reward would be having a system outside of the reach of governments and all the other benefits. If by reward you mean getting filthy rich then yeah, I guess so. But I wouldn't call myself an early adopter and I still made a pretty penny. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:52:33
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:56:33
There is a backlog of unconfirmed transactions. Basically, btc is being used more than it can currently handle
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:08:03
Be it from 3k to 1k or 10k to 3k, that shit will hit haaaaaaard.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:10:56
Whoops
