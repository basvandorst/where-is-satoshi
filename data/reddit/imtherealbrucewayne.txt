This, it hasn’t gotten far because it’s not even 10 years old, it’s completely brand new, imagine how long it took for Microsoft to get going! Or before that imagine how long it took for automobile production to get going to what it is today!
10 years is nothing in the grand scheme of things

Well judging by that logic any entrepreneur who has started any company anywhere in the world in the last 200 years should also go on trial
Should we posthumously charge Alan Turing for the impact that the computer has had?
Should we charge the owner of McDonalds because of their contribution to the obesity epidemic? 
Or should we just go back 12,000 years to charge the first man to domesticate animals for slaughter - as this is where it really all started
Thoughts? :)

Literally this, the system isn’t perfect - yet
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:34:24
It actually is!

Just 5? I tried 4 a few minutes ago but nothing happened, I’ll try 10!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:21:39
Worked for me

I’ll try this and let you know how much sweet sweet BTC are inside!

I bought in at 4K before it plummeted, I’m glad I hedl’d

Buy more if you can, if not, don’t fret, hodl and smile through those salty tears

You need to be accessing coinbase on the same device/computer that you are opening the emailed link on
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:35:19
All I can see is that it's a good time to buy and hodl

Wow, please update this, I would like to know how you get it resolved, I'm dubious about using gdax anyway 
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:15:05
They will adapt or die

Seriously fuck this guy, he is shaking in his boots that the world is now realising that their entire banking system is based upon nothing but imagination and is trying to stop someone else's imagination from taking his job
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:47:03
I’ve never done that! What happens then?!
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:42:25
What happens when it reaches 0?
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:02:15
Hardware offline wallet is the best option, can't hack an air gap
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:55:57
What's the date for the next fork?
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:12:41
You need to verify it through your coinbase account, 
At first it seems a bit long winded but it's not bad once it's done 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:42:42
You get an upvote 
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:57:37
Is this confirmed?
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:09:26
Don't use coinbase, use gdax, it is coinbase but better, 
They have a list of banks you can use
