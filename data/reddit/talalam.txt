i got one a few weeks ago - it is SUPER intuitive, and i am not even a tech-y. Did not watch any videos or anything, pretty straightforward and fast process... There are TONS of videos on youtube but Ledger Live is very user friendly, you will be fine

Read about the tech first, if you believe in it definitely invest. But it also depends on when you are expecting to make a return on your fiat. If you are ready to forget about your BTC for the next few years, definitely buy now while its still under 10k.. Monitor for a few days and try to buy at its lowest, anywhere between 7500 and 8500 would be good.. Realistically, i doubt it will go under 8k anytime soon so a good bet would be between 8k and 8500.. To sum up yes, buy and hodl
