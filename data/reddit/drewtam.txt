The 19th century British monarchy was strongly counterbalanced by the lords of Parliament. They had enough independent wealth and [hard fought authority]( that they could maintain a serious threat to life and legitimacy of the king if he got too crazy.  
  
The American and other overseas colonies were refused parliamentary protections, hence "taxation without representation". No member of parliament felt any loyalty to any of the colonies. The colonies had no option to redress wrongs, or any way to work within the system.

Ok, I'm stupid. Now explain it slow and clearly, for a stupid person, why a business would accept a form of payment that changes value dramatically from week to week?
  
In such a case, by the end of a month when its ready to pay suppliers in USD, the bitcoin in the company wallet may fall short. Why would a business take such a financing risk?

There is nothing about bitcoin or gold or any other that prevents fractional reserve banking.

All very valid criticisms, and all things that banks and credit card systems do in the background that we take for granted. Of course, no one wants to hear that banks and credit card companies provide a valid if not essential service.
On the positive side, these are technical issues that can be overcome with business and technical solutions, which is a lot easier than political roadblocks.

[The scarier number is the total private debt (financial institutions, households, &amp; business).]( Private institutions and people took on a great deal more debt than the government, it absolutely dwarfs the latter. Before clicking the link, take a guess what year it peeked and began to decline...

That is just silly. The US dominated the world in the post WW2 environment from its military and economic might, which quickly transformed into a worldwide proxy war between US aligned nations and USSR aligned nations. 50 years of the cold war built that influence bit by bit under the very real spectre of confrontation with the USSR. Many, if not most, Americans considered that long drawn out confrontation as very real, and [very much important issue in voting.](

Working backwards through comment thread, and forward through history...  
The US built influence, per my comment.  
That influence was used to a control money flow (for US citizens) in the new world order of a single super power and fast growing international finance.  
That influence and money control was used to setup so called money laundering jurisdictions world wide.
