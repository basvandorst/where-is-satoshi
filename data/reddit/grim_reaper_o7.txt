The art of holding basically says doesn't panic sell but know when to really sell when people get too greedy according to Warren Buffet. Otherwise, buy high, sell low r/wallstreetbets is your place.

As much as no one will like this, but ever since Bitcoin entered the public trading scene with futures on CBOE and CME it's price has dropped considerably. I'm probably betting someone is making a killing on this bear run right now. There's real money to be made and it's working out for some on these markets.

I can confirm by using **Coinbase**, they charged me $15 for a ~$100 transaction to move bitcoin to Poloniex. I had never heard of GDAX until someone made a post how to circumvent the Coinbase fees. It's literally in their terms of service and what they charge to run an exchange.  I have not use **GDAX** and currently cannot get that ID verification cause their system is bogged down so much it feels like a DDOS attack.

Every cryptos best friend.

I give you a short summary. Those fees from Coinbase and not GDAX may not be coming down as long as the backlog of Bitcoin keeps going up. If you don't think there is anything wrong this I would be alarmed because it's a effective strategy. Coinbase is a business after all and a business has to earn profits to keep going. That's the basic principle of a business.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:09:36
That's why you use GDAX which bypasses those fees. There was a post here on how to circumvent those fees.

I would rather toss money into the options market while cryptocurrency is not fulfilling the expectations as expected of a real investment.

What you gonna do if the price drops to $5000 before year's end.

GENIUS, MY BOY. Now I can DD on AMD calls for Q2 2018. But seriously, make it a scrolling band of stock symbols and now we're rolling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:44
Please, I can't even get the GDAX ID verification process done. It's a complete turnoff. The $15 fee on a $100 transaction is more annoying.
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:54:28
What you gonna do if the price drops to $1000 three years from now?
You really are taking a loss if it does this. But is more symbolic of the fact it's just a speculative currency with no underlying backing other than the belief its value is agreed upon.

I was speaking about trends in the market as a whole in regards to certain factors that make it for the smart people who see when to buy when there's fear and sell when there's high. The Warren Buffet strategy that's worked to him.

Until someone really effs up the whole system resulting in an economic crash. Truth is the next economic crash will involve cryptos so it's a waiting game to see what happens when the market sours again.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:20:57
I will wait to buy back in when it's $500.
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:13:18
Bet you it falls futher when Coinbase becomes SEC registered and the real traders shorti it so much because the only thing holding it up is people's belief the item has value which is one of the fundamentals of currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:35:40
And that's why I do Dogecoin. In reality Bitcoin's price is still going down for a long-term trend.
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:37:36
How you gonna account for the fact poor people don't have access to electronic stuff like a computer or phone in an area where there may not be one for 100 kilometers?

Only 0.3%?! I get a much better ROI shoving my money into those 5% quarterly dividends. Seriously a bad return just to run a node when you lose out on the electricity even if it was pennies.

5% quarterly dividends from stock market. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:55:56
Nope. 5% quarterly dividends in the stock market. I thought using the word dividends would hint to use of stock market.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:39:07
After being corrected by another post. It's a 5% yearly dividend. Not Quarterly. However, the fact stands 5% annually is much better than 0.3% which is much better than my saving's account rate of 0.01%.

It's in context to South Africa. Something is fishy about the website in the link. I can't tell if this is real or not because it uses a website template by MagPress at the bottom of the page. 
Side note: No need to use the word "fucking" in one of your sentences emphasize a point.

At this point, if Bitcoin can be given value because people believe it has value just like fiat currency does. There's really nothing to stop the creation of another form of currency having value be it the time or upvote/downvotes to buy stuff like that black mirror episode.

The rest is purely profit for operating a business. Probably bet those transaction fees are 10 cents.

The only time they want to regulate is when they decide they are not being paid that tax money.

More like a tax at that point for transferring money.

Store reward systems are only guaranteed by the company to have value whether it comes in a gift card, redeemable points, or earned points like Starbucks. Store goes bankrupt and it's worthless just like Toys R Us. With that said, I would just collect the coins for it becomes valuable a decade later.

I say Bitcoin will go down to $2000, but the big investors are still seeing it as price built on just speculation with nothing to back it.
