Then factor in that while Visa's daily transacton volume may hover in the order of 16 billion dollars, the daily foreign exchange market is in the order of 3 to 5 trillion dollars.

This is most likely as a result of strict European antimoneylaundering rules than as a result of bitcoin.  The fact is that you were receiving and issuing transactions higher than the mandatory reporting limit, and the banks are legally required to report those transactions as potential  compliance issues.  It won't just be Germany, it will be the same for all EU countries, and even stricter in the UK.  Banking systems are designed to detect and flag potential fraud, and you matched transaction patterns which flagged you as a person of interest.

Not this specific case, in general.  Money entering and leaving accounts needs to have a legitimate explanation.

I'm unsure whether you are being deliberately obtuse or not.  Money that magically appears in your account would usually be bound to a salary, and come from a tax-registered entity in your country of residence.  If not, there are tax implications, and your country's revenue service must be notified so that they can flag the transactions as of interest or not of interest.  In addition, financial institutions in the EU have many very strict laws with which they are expected to comply (witness the recent massive fines levied on HSBC for not doing so).
As such, if funds appear in your account from a new source (or even from an existing source with an established pattern of flagged transactions), or your account has been flagged as an account of interest, or you receive a sudden windfall larger than the mandatory reporting limit, the transaction will be flagged.  This is done so that for e.g. it is more difficult to launder large amounts of money at any one time, and so that tax evasion becomes more difficult.
In this specific case it was a false positive, but it demonstrates that the system is working as expected and documented.  Don't want to run foul of the transaction flagging rules?  Deal in cash.

This policing is to prevent money laundering and fraud, and forms a necessary part of the financial system.

Better than a false negative in this case (financial fraud).
