Most people don't see the bigger picture yet. There will be problems along the way but cryptocurrency is the future imo. They have already come this far and continue to over come obstacles as things happen while growing along the journey. It's just the beginning. I'm willing to bet bitcoin hits $100k in 2018. Most people think its too late to invest in these coins. I think it's early.

Something interesting? Bitcoin is the Gold of cryptocurrency. Personally predicting the price to be over $100k by the end of 2018. I would sell my dog for a bitcoin right now.

Mindset is by far the most valuable asset in life ;)

If you bought way back then and held some for all this time, you obviously have some understanding in bitcoin. It doesn't seem like you do tho.. everybody I know that's been in crypto for a year plus is holding their coins because they know its just the beginning. I'm willing to bet bitcoin hits $100k+ in 2018

Unfortunately no known economic system is perfect. They all have their strong points and their negatives.
