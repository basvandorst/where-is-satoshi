Industry Jargon is invented for the soul purpose of being a pretentious ass. 
Keep sucking your own dick.

Yes because "Hodl" and "Lambo" and "Tendies" are such valuable terms to a discussion of economics.

"whales, Spoofies, noobs, your bags" yes all of these are very professional important academic concepts valuable to describing the industry. They totally don't have already established synonyms.

I can't tell what the fuck half these terms are. I mean I guess that's how stocks came up with their terms to like bear and bull markets but for fucks sake if bitcoin is ever going to be a legit threat or counter measure to wall street elites it needs to stop with the fucking gatekeeper language, Made by 12 year olds might I add.

You have yet to explain to me the importances of these terms Mr.Hodlgang. Or should I say Dr. Hodlgang since you're apparently a psychologist on the side of being an investment billionaire.

You're really focused on this SJW angle Dr. Hodlgang.

Oh wow, one term that actually already could have just been claimed as lying. This still doesn't change the fact the crypto market un-ironicaly uses stupid meme terms.
Have you fucking seen how well dodge coin is doing??? You know the coin that was literally made as a joke? 
Nothing you've said is effecting my point and about half of your "argument" is just built around insults. All I've been trying to say here is that the stock market has structures and a culture around it meant to keep it as a form of elitism and crypto currency which the community so desperately desires to overcome could easily fall victim to that by using these stupid joke words.

Why does this happen?
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:06:18
Transaction fees? You mean people have to pay miners to use the coins they mine? I swear. 
I go out of my way to try and dig up what i can on how this shit works and this is the only way ive ever learned anything about crypto.

What is a halving?
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:08:29
What do I do with those?
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:30:06
You are why I hate the crypto community. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:18:31
Do all cryptos do this?
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:30:30
What does that mean?
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:11:11
So this will keep going until it completely stops producing any bitcoin?
