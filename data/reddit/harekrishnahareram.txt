Um, some explanation please? For noobs sake? :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 07:39:10
Litecoin? Oh dear, looks like the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper. But I do like the idea of fast confirmations with zero fee. I'll take a look, thanks for the suggestion!
One question though, if litecoin is that good, why isn't it the defacto over bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-04-30 14:20:07
Yup, I think 4 levels with the lowest being "low priority", but from what I read on the net, low priority is about 0.00008 btc and it goes higher from there.
@_date: 2016-04-30 12:36:03
Yup thanks! I think I'll try it out with electrum. I figure I might as well bite the bullet and spend the transaction fees on other wallets as well just to get familiarity
@_date: 2016-04-30 12:31:42
That's very impressive, last I checked the lowest mycelium would go was around 0.00008 which is close to the same mytrezor. How does it go lower? Does it depend on your transactions or some pipeline based intelligence that mycelium has built in?
@_date: 2016-04-30 14:13:53
Lol - it so happened that I first bought the wallet and then went "Umm what is a bitcoin again?". Been researching everything I can abt bitcoin and cryptocurrency since then and I must admit, it's a nerd's wet dream :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 08:31:33
Good suggestion on transferring to a wallet that lets me choose the transaction fees! Move a couple of dollars from the trezor to the wallet at 4 cents and just keep playing around with that until I run out :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:23:32
I wish I had so much money to move around the globe :p. Yup looking at that link now, thanks :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:25:34
Thanks for explaining, I guess that makes sense. I'm not against a fee, I guess I'd like to have it at a reasonable percentage of the transaction I'm doing and not a flat fee.
@_date: 2016-04-30 23:12:12
I bought $2 worth at a bitcoin ATM and $20 worth on localbitcoins.com. Both were not too great on the exchange rate, but it was a small amount
@_date: 2016-04-30 12:34:30
Don't intend to! I know it costs money to hash and I am happy to pay. Just don't want it to be as much as my transaction amount :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 07:37:55
Yup, that's what I was considering doing to start with.
@_date: 2016-04-30 07:10:35
Well, yea, in a way I guess. But I want to experiment with fees as well and it kinda bugs me that most of these wallets (trezor, mycelium etc) sort of pre-decide the amount of fees they think we should pay. I mean if nothing else, I'll pay the 4 cents, just want to know if I can make it lower, like 1 cent. Maybe I'll use Electrum for all my test transactions :|
@_date: 2016-04-30 07:06:59
Well, my friend sort of sold it to me at a discount (~37 USD) rather than give it to me :D. I bought it on a whim and am now trying to wrap my head around bitcoins since I have zero idea about it.
I currently have roughly around $20 USD in bitcoin to play around with. 
But I intend to play around with paper wallets, software wallets, mobile wallets, deleting and restoring wallets using seeds etc, before I use it for anything practical. Hence, I was hoping for something lower than 4 cents. I'm going to be transferring to and from several wallets to gain more confidence.
I believe 10 minutes is each block right? I'm okay experimenting with different fees amounts to see which one gives me in the next block and which one takes forever :D.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:44:27
Why don't you post the transaction link and the wallet address? How will the person know whether it's him/her if you don't share any details?

Sorry just saw your other post, sorry about that man.
@_date: 2016-06-06 00:29:23
By derived wallets I assume you're talking about the altcoin wallets that are derived from the same master private key.
I believe coinomi for Android supports BIP39 keywords amd several altcoins and it should be pretty easy for someone to use your passphrase (set of keywords for your BIP32 wallet).

@_date: 2016-06-06 00:17:57
If you are in no rush for it to get confirmed, put 0.00001 or something around that. This may take a couple of days and if you're unlucky maybe longer. But if you need something sooner, 0.0001 might be advisable. Yea, unfortunately that is like 10% fees.

Sorry to hear that - it sounds to me that you accidentally created a cold storage wallet as per the link below. This only allows you to send money to your wallet but don't think it'll allow you to pull money out. I'm pretty sure you'll need the master seed to recover the wallet:

How is it traceable? If I generate an address using bitaddress.org and someone sends some btc to it, no one can ever trace it.
@_date: 2016-05-20 06:57:00
We're speculating right? It's currency after all, why won't it fluctuate? :D
Check out USD vs AUD:
@_date: 2016-05-24 23:57:25
That's a good idea, didn't secondlife have something similar? I remember seeing realtime exchange rate between USD and the secondlife currency.
I guess my point is, if the game is worth playing, you probably don't need to share revenue to get people to play. Angry birds and regular Minecraft for example

I will tell you the secret to getting rich ~~on Wall Street~~ with bitcoin. You try to be greedy when others are fearful. And you try to be fearful when others are greedy. –Warren Buffett
@_date: 2016-05-11 01:08:30
I'm no expert but I'll take a stab. I presume you are referring to HD wallets like mycelium. What these wallets do is they have a master public key which can be used to generate any  number of new wallet addresses to receive btc to. Think of each of them as a single independent wallet. When you send btc from this wallet, it then does some clever mix and match from all the wallets so that the exact amount you need is obtained and sent. But they actually get sent from each of the individual wallets that are in the HD wallet.
If you want a single independent wallet instead of an HD wallet you can use a paper wallet like the one generated by bitaddress.org
@_date: 2016-05-15 23:32:46
I wonder how long term this change will be if they enforce it. Its only a matter of time before a new asic is built which does the same job only faster.
Also, I'm confused by the logic of proof of work enforcement by trying to keep asics from being used. Asics are super efficient and consume less energy to do superior computation. It seems somehow wrong that we want to keep things intentionally difficult for the sake of it. I understand the problem of power getting centralised in one location, but this just seems wrong.
Why don't we change the protocol to limit the amount of hashing each node can pump out? That way the node can work for 5 mins and turnoff for 5 mins saving energy. I figure it's better than having my gfx card run for 60 mins to do the same thing.
Why don't the core devs come up with a certain asic design which does this reasonably efficiently and open source it so anyone can build one? Maybe even enforce a hardware signature that can only be used for connecting to the network?
I may be wrong here, but it just doesn't feel right
@_date: 2016-05-18 10:54:02
Buy want you can afford to lose. If 1 btc is too much, buy 0.5. Or 0.01 even. Then add more to it as and when you can. Or spend it !The beauty of bitcoin is that it allows 8 decimal places.
And 0.05 btc today will buy you many coffees :)
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:32:42
Thanks, that makes perfect sense. So if someone sends funds to my paper wallet after sweeping can I still receive it?

Scam? Found this link:
@_date: 2016-05-20 04:26:06
Well, that's not for me to know :D.
But the main point is your risk appetite. 100 BTC is just an example. 1 BTC might be a huge amount of money that you're not willing to risk and might want to use a paper wallet and maybe not have more than 0.05 BTC online or on your phone.
End of the day, it's your preference, there's no right or wrong. Make sure the risk you expose yourself to is not high enough to affect your sleep at night :D.

The more I think about this and sarutobi, the more I feel games shouldn't have to pay folks a cut of the ad revenue for playing game. Isn't playing the game for free reward enough? Work is a grind anyways and I play games to unwind and relax a bit. Why make a game a grind? And nothing comes for free. The downside is I have to watch terrible ads over and over again. And the fact that the games main purpose is to give you a share of the ad revenue, the dev (through no fault of his/her own) ends up sacrificing a bit of the gameplay for more and more frequent ads.
As a gamer the concept weighs heavy on my mind :(.
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:25:11
If you just want to receive bitcoins you can use mycelium for Android or copay for iOS and Android. I've heard bad things abt blockchain wallet so maybe avoid that. Note that if the other party does send you bitcoin it should at least say unconfirmed transaction almost instantly. If not he didn't save it. As a good practice wait for 6 confirmations that your money has come in. That's what all the exchanges do.
Edit: also you will get a new address for these wallets so you may need to ask him to resend it to that address.
@_date: 2016-05-08 02:54:37
I had the same trust issues with my first Bitcoin ATM purchase. I bought some bitcoin for $2 to see if it worked and it worked fine. Heavy transaction fees though (~3%). IMO, an exchange is better to buy bitcoin than an ATM. The ATM gives you the feeling of anonymity because it's cash to anonymous wallet transaction, but don't discount the security cams around you :). Personally, I think coinbase gives better rates.

Did you send him the giftcard on the internal chat or separately? If it's an image, I would always recommend sending it via internal chat. In any case, you probably have proof that you sent him the giftcard, chat conversation etc. Use that and raise a dispute with localbitcoins. 
I believe localbitcoins has a 90 minutes limit or something. If you've marked it as complete and the seller hasn't marked it as complete, do they automatically release the bitcoins in escrow to you? Or do they return to sender? I would guess the former since that makes more sense to me, but do check the documentation.

Hey thanks for sharing this! I watched the video and I think some aspects of the rendering are really cool, the way you get the fog effects around the collisions, the halos etc. I also like how you can drop into a planet, explore the different parts (I wish the video went into the cave, was curious to see what was inside :D). But I'm not entirely sure what the end objective is. I get that it's sandbox style gameplay with the ability to build entire solar systems and galaxies. Are there more interactions that you will build into it? Like planetary collisions viewed from the surface of the planet? Any chance we'll be able to fast forward time to see plants and animals start taking shape on our planet? I think it would be super cool to play God like Bender in that one futurama episode where he plays God to a group of tiny beings on his belly :D.
Also I think some music might be needed, but you probably are working on that already.
Anyways, sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear, I think the graphics are pretty cool and I like the concept. Just not entirely sure about the end objective.
Good luck with the game! :)

Print the QR code of your wallet on a paper and scan it at the ATM.
@_date: 2016-05-14 14:26:41
Don't mean use the wallet provided by the ATM. More like take a screenshot on your mobile of the QR code on mycelium or copay or coinomi and scan that.
@_date: 2016-05-24 23:54:47
Hmm you have a point. So in that case I suppose we can argue that the people who play the protein folding game are more interested in helping understand protein structure and design and less interested in playing a game. Similarly killing monsters to earn coin must attract folks whose primary motivation is to make money. So these games attract a different demographic, not necessarily the ones who want to play the game. Maybe I'm overanalyzing this :)

I agree with you 100%. I was attracted to btc by the "instant" thing as well. Didn't know there was a pretty high fee involved for quick transactions. I'm not from a first world country, and I've never paid fees for using a credit/debit card or a bank account. And it's free of charge for me (the customer). 30 cents for a 10 min confirmation (or more these days) is way too high. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:18:40
Depends on how much is in the wallet. Consider the implications of you storing it on the phone. Yes, other apps can have access to your photo gallery. Android generally tells you what an app has access to when you install it, but this doesn't help for apps installed earlier. Also, how many times do you pay attention to the permissions of an app when you install it?
Secondly, you carry your phone everywhere with you. Or it's at least reasonably more mobile than a binder you have in a cupboard at home. Higher likelihood of 
a. Losing it
b. Theft
c. Destruction (dropped OMG)
Thirdly, somebody may see it. Let's say you're swiping through pics and showing someone or someone else gets their hand on your phone and is swiping through the pics and notices a list of 12 random words, there is a chance that that person knows it's a random seed. A small chance, but a chance nonetheless.
We could go on. But allow me to ask you this - do you really think your phone is more secure than the cupboard at home. You could store it on your phone and  not lose sleep if it's only $50 (or whatever is a small number for you). But what if it's $500 or $5000? $50000? At some point storing on your phone no longer seems like a good idea :)
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:24:24
How did you send through localbitcoin? Did you initiate a trade with him? If you did Localbitcoins would store the BTC amount from him in escrow and will not release it until both sides have confirmed. Do you mean he hasn't confirmed on his side but has already spent the gift card? Maybe raise a dispute with localbitcoins?
@_date: 2016-05-08 03:27:18
Why don't you try opening the files with a few of the wallets? Try downloading bitcoin-core or electrum and see if you can open them? But you might need to put in a passphrase, pin or something to access it though.

If I were the government, it should be pretty easy for me to just spend a billion dollars or so and set up my own servers to start mining. I'll definitely control more than 51% of the blockchain. What then? Other governments will come in pumping their own dollars into it to share the blockchain and spread the authority. Finally we'll have a united nations of sort with a few countries controlling the currency. Decentralization won't exist anymore if it only needs superior computing power.

I agree with garrylie! I think full transparency will be a good thing.

I think it depends on how many bitcoins you have and your risk appetite.
I'm happy to carry 0.5 BTC on my phone and ~1 BTC in my online wallet for easy access. If I've got 100 BTC, I think I'll exclusively put it on Trezor/paper wallet. 
But that's me and my risk appetite. You may be just as comfortable keeping 100 BTC on coinbase.

I would say bitcoin is not "instant" in the universal sense of the word. Cash is "instant" when you hand it to a store keeper for a product or in exchange for a service. Cash is "instant" when you give money to a friend to settle last night's beer tab. Bitcoin is at best "reasonably fast as long as you adhere to a minimum fee".
And I feel the fee fixation is unfortunate at this point. But I'm still optimistic that it will improve soon. Even 10 minutes is way too long IMO. I'm not saying it's unacceptable, I'm just saying that the end goal should be "instant" in the true sense of the word and we shouldn't just accept "good enough"
