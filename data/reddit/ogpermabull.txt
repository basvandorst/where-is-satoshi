So then I will play around with BIP38 paper wallet. Putting money on. Taking money off.
If it works then I am set.
My only other question if why would anyone use anything else to store their bitcoin? Why not just use BIP38?
What is the benifit of storing in any other fasion?
Because of a worry your house might burn down with the paper wallet or drive? Then why not copy it multiple times, encrypt that, then stash it multiple places?
I have to be missing something
Thank you guys for the quick help

And Armory is not owned by anyone?
How can I know that it will not cease to exist in 10 years?

Yes, but because people are holding them if you were in a situation where the law was looking for the money, someone would cough it up. Then you end up in jail for obstruction of justice if you refuse to give the password up. There is a specific case in my country in the last few years where someone was sentenced to jail time for not giving their password up to their encrypted drive. This is why I am going overboard. If I have to fork my money over to my wife by law then I am screwed if I keep it on paper.

Someone correct me if I am wrong. Could I not just make a paper wallet. Copy the key into a word doc. Then encrypt that with my PGP pub key.
Then copy that and put it onto several flash drives.
Is there something I am missing about paper wallets or is this a simple solution???
Thanks IronVape

To be clear. Holding the coin safe is not only as a "retirement fund."
But also to hide it

Assume it is a hypothetical then. 
Does it matter?
Researching paper wallets now

So then instead can I?
1    Get an old laptop 
2   Download a PGP Client
3   Load up bitaddress.org downloaded from GitHub to run offline.
4     Disconnect from internet. This computer can never connect to the internet again.
5     Generate 3 paper wallets and BIP38 encrypt their private keys. So even in the slim chance something happens to a few of my drives containing one of the keys I have something left.
 6 PGP Encrypt 5 copies of each same key. 15 total. Saving the encrypted text into a document. Not encrypting the file. But the actual text in the file.
 7   Bury them all over the country so that when my wife wins the divorce they can search all they want, but I have no idea what happened to the money ;) If I kept them with me or in my house it would be found. If I give them to a friend it would be given over. This is my only option.
8 Bury 5 flash drives with the PGP private key in separate places. So if found it is just a meaningless block of text.
9 Recite the PGP password and the BIP38 password every day before bed.
Is there anything wrong with the above? Is there some reason the above will not work?
