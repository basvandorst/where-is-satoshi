Look at the current chart, 2 months (6 hr bars) at BitCoin Charts.  What it shows it that this pullback is appropriate, orderly, and hits all the key targets.
Case in point: - The major move was clearly hyperbolic and unsustainable. Major correction was needed. - There was a clear double top put in above $1100 - Wave theory predicts a 3 wave down, which it performed very nicely. - There were two low targets. It hit the lowest of them this AM (5:30 est) when it traded just below $400/s for a few minutes. IMO, this is what should have happen. If this low number holds (~400), it sets up a new long term 5 wave move to the upside.
All the news and events tend to justify or cause or confirm the movement. When they line up like this, its a beautiful thing.

What I am puzzled by is the apparent lack of any understanding of the "technical s" on what is happening with the price moves.  This pullback is appropriate, orderly, and hits all the key targets.
