This is why coinbase was probably funded by the us government and based out of NY, Gemini is next. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:10:54
what research? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:32:46
no one will really know the real consequences as quantum can damage more than just crypto 
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:55:22
no paper wallet? thats the safest wallet and free 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:58:31
relax, no need to 'win' anything bitcoin will in due time prove itself again, i used to go on btc and argue with them till i realized the technology will prove itself anyways, and if it Somehow doesn't than at least at btc they understand that bitcoin is only a REAL peoples fork away from any failures. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:36:42
this guy speaks about 500k like its 100 million
take a deep breath, now a days especially in bitcoin anyone could have 500k . secondly if this guy is such a smarty pants with a single google search he would have known that Michael Patryn a known scammer who was convicted for fraud in the past is running that exchange. And finally for a smarty pants to lose 500k and not go straight to a lawyer smells like bullocks , let me go to reddit first lol !

all 4 of those things destroy a trezor as well , did you even think this through? i have a lot of paper wallets printed encrypted with a password that inside my head. if water destroys one no problem, even if a person finds one no problem , they won't know the password.  on the other hand if water destroys a trezor your stuck with what? yeah exactly a piece of paper anyways and go buy another 150$ device 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:11:13
with the constant fud spreading i wonder how many weak hands backed out already

Denynothing (1 month ago): 'J invest in bitcoin you’ll be ok'
telling people to invest into bitcoins and now complaining of pump and dump .

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:00:17
message coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:29:32
like bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:56:48
first off if your a bitcoin millionaire and known for that you'd have body guards. Secondly someone can steal your trezor or paper wallet but most are password encrypted anyways and you have a backup paper wallet like me somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:25:12
let me fix the title for you
"Newbies trying hodl for the first time "

virtual bitcoin transactions within coinbase network , If amazon accepts bitcoin i will never return to fiat ever. 
It'll be a huge game changer. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:48:27
heres my hunch :  your another butthurt who had heard about bitcoin way before it blew up and missed your chance 
or just another weak hands  who buys high sells low
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:06:25
bye! have fun ! can't wait for the upcoming fixes? bye bye bebe! see you back in a few years when your complaining that you didn't buy when you had a chance.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:01:46
that ceo guy wishes he had a body guard don't he? thanks for the downvote nabs! he will probably now get one too after paying a million dollars in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:51:47
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:02:51
tell that to  Pavel Lerner
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:33:53
password encrypted paper wallet, the password is in your head and cannot be robbed , the paper can but you'll have different paper wallets in different places once you get robbed simply sweep the wallet into a new password encrypted paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:56:39
how many bitcoins? i may be able to dedicate some resources to unlocking it depending if its worth the time
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:59:05
so it ends up the well known bitcoin millionaire CEO had to pay up 1 million dollars , how expensive are body guards  you ask? gee i don't know could cost you your life , but in this case just 1 million dollars plus the fact that he will now hire body guards anyways LOL
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:30:57
so here's my question, if pump and dump works who are the ones losing money? 
weak hands who sell low? YES
hodlers ? NO
Why don't hodlers lose?
 hodl all the way until 'they' pump and dump again and everytime reaching a new ATH. 
Now my question is if they NEED weak hands who sell out of panick, it's actually their duty to spread FUD hard on bitcoin right after dumping causing a mass price bearish market and they literally buy back minutes after selling . 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:06:30
miss type? first time in the history of the universe
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:37:56
very inexpensive actually , i rather lose 40k a year for a low end body guard than lose millions or my life (if everyone recognized me as a big money bag ofc).  same way people rather change oils than lose the entire engine . you are talking relative to you its expensive but many public figure millionaires like beyonce or drake or bill gates would never go into a public place without some sort of protection. so please stop taking everything out of context, it was a suggestion , i am 100% sure there are crypto millionaires out there who have body guards on pay so relax.

if you seriously paid "$80" when you could have easily paid 1/10 of that or less,  you have no idea how this technology works at all and have no respect for it.

its a good idea actually put in a filter and a moderator to pull the switch ban

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:54:19

@_date: 2017-12-31 14:42:55
oh really how? why are some people claiming to sell their houses to buy into bitcoin? maybe they should have listened to some advice

@_date: 2017-12-31 01:00:27
here's a little history lesson
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:38:47
easy hodl , the technology bro
lowest amount in circulation in the crypto scene
Insane popularity
mining difficult increases 
more big players yet to adopt it
alot of wallets have been lost with bitcoin in them meaning even LESS in circulation
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:03:52
this post aged nicely! wish  Pavel Lerner would have been here to read this 3 days ago before getting kidnapped , almost like i'm from the future
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:05:07
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:42:53
meh its good exposure and he doesn't represent bitcoin hahahaha who are you kiddin 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:27:40
it hasn't affected me directly and everyone else who it has affected can hodl for now or use low fee transaction like me for 3$ until we as a whole can get it back down to a few cents. I rather wait then trust the new guy who has been around for 6 months god knows if its a government take over. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:14:21
cool story tell me more
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:17:07
lol this guy , why does your car have a water pump? oh to protect the engine from overheating and becoming completely unusable? fuck that water pumps are expensive selling mine today! 
Many public figures do not go around without body guards
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:31:17
new people join to try and catch a profit and as they sell the people create a resistance level by buying what they are selling .  therfor honoring the price of bitcoin at the price they are selling therfor if it drops it won't drop as much as you might think
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:25:39
fud much ? i just sent a transaction for .50 cents and its going just fine
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:17:59

@_date: 2017-12-29 03:03:04
i becha that Director of UK-Based Crypto Exchange that gotgot kidnapped for being a well known bitcoin holder wishes he had invested in bodyguards 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:39:40

and your offering a solution how? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:05:03
We found him again the psychology expert, can tell exactly how a person is expressing themselves by reading a few words. 
Try re-reading it a few times, first act as if its a slow voice 
then a manic voice
then a woman softly speaking it 
then try maybe sarcasm and also try it without sarcasm

you just made absolutely zero sense , how would you know my level of interest in bitcoins success? 
1.No big merchants (newegg )accept bch so "spending it"  is rather useless atm
2.  if everyone were to move over to bch the fees would be $6.25 
then what a new fork? A new fork every time a cryptocurrency gets insanely popular in a short period of time instead of patiently waiting for the right fix. 
3. bitcoin will be fixed its just a matter of time.

@_date: 2017-12-26 20:40:58
you won't but i would, if i am known to be a bitcoin millionaire i'd obviously have body guards lol kinds of stupid ass investor wouldn't invest in body guards.

You sound dumber the more you talk because you seem to ignore inflation. Inflation alone makes bitcoin more valuable than any currency.

good explanation thank you
whether true or not  (which i will check charts and form my opinion later)
I learned something from the video. 
You should try make tutorials on things like these.
