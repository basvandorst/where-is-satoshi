The paper might be water proof and all that, but I seriously doubt the ink that will go on it will be.  If you are that concerned then cheap lamination might be a better option.  
@_date: 2014-06-28 12:43:31
The one I clicked on was actually an executable. I had believed it was a compressed file .  Or more likely I decompressed and then clicked on the resulting exe like an idiot
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:58:54
Sure enough lots of junk found that AVG does not pickup. thanks for that suggestion. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:21:34
Ideally would like to know who is behind this and what the source of the breach was.  Looks like others have also had coins stolen into that wallet.  
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:35:18
This guy " Tazja" admitted to controlling the address my coins went to in this post 
Anyone know him?
I use 2 adress,

@_date: 2014-06-28 02:21:46
I don't have any illusions of recovering the bitcoin.  But publicity will help put this guy out in the open so when he screws with someone closer to him he can be easier to find and then dealt with appropriately.  His malware is out there and continues to steal people's btc.  He's scum and made the fatal error of not covering his tracks by publicizing the address he then used to funnel coins to via his key logger.  I like to think the bitcoin community on reddit is not evil.  
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:21:22
I suspect an nzb from Usenet that I then clicked on.  I was an idiot and naive enough to think AV software would alert me to key loggers.  Still this Guy deserves a little discipline.  He seems to have stolen over $40k just on this wallet. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:04:48
Key loggers are amongst the most insidious programs out there.  I honestly was under the mistaken assumption that a paid version of an AV program would have that detection part nailed down.  Ha!  Stupid me.  Kaspersky and AVG both failed to even recognize I was infected.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:51:00
Correct.  I was actually looking for porn.  Wtf? Are you somehow suggesting malware distributors are justified?  
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:06:47
Not exactly new to r/bitcoin but I recently managed to lose all my coins to a theft (see my prior postings).  11.76 btc.  Perhaps a small tip can get me going again :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:43:20
I agree the coins are likely gone.  But this guy has a life somewhere in Aubenas France and there will be people who know him and I want them to know this guy is a criminal scumbag.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 10:22:23
Yes .  But going forward my reserve wallets will be offline entirely
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:21:30
Yes I learned a big lesson. Doesn't mean I let this sleaze ball Dubas go on to defraud others without leaving a trace. I had an encrypted password protected wallet on a pc shared with other family members.  I'm sure I am not the only one who felt they were covered along with basic AV.  Only after did I realize AVG and Kaspersky are not enough.  Took Malwarebytes to detect the intrusion.  
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:24:05
And why do you continue to suggest that I was stealing ?  I said I clicked on a nzb file. Look up nzb. I am sure you might come across a few million nzb that have absolutely nothing to do with porn or games or warez. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:20:59
from my OP you can see a list of his typical uploads here 
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:19:40
Run Malwarebytes scan from Malwarebytes.org.  Then also scan with the various tools at bleepingcomputer.com.  Took me three different malware detection programs to finally isolate the last worm on my machine.  
Do not enter a wallet passphrase until you have done the above and then only to move the contents to a paper wallet or one with 2 factor authentication.  Hope this helps 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:24:12
Got it.  I replied. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-20 10:09:03
My intent is to reward 2 btc for anyone who helps recover the lost coins upon their return
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:56:07
If you help me up vote this perhaps a French redditor will notice this and can help forward this to the local authorities at Aubenas France.   
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:43:37
Not requesting sympathy from anyone.  I am totally responsible for clicking on shit.  The fact remains that this guy is a thief and I am far from his only victim.  Also, better people than myself have had bitcoin stolen from them. The same argument could be said for people who entrusted mtgox and any of the 90% of bitcoin wallets that have ever existed.  A population here would say only people who use paper wallets should hold bitcoin.  I'm not part of that population cause I want bitcoin to be widespread and not need a degree in IT to feel safe using it.

With some help from a bitcointalk forum member and I got a little closer today.  Need more help still if you live in France or know this individual:
Tazja is known as tazbox on a hackers forum (
16th post in this topic shows tazbox probably is up to no good/linked to bitcoin (
Then if we look a bit further we find this topic about tazja being a hacker: 
If you look at post 18, you see a post of bitdonkey. He stated he also got hacked by tazja.
If we look up bitdonkey's post we see this post about him purchasing a VPS host: 
Domain is tazbox. As stated previously, that is the username of Tazja. So either bitdonkey is tazja, or he wanted to make a website dedicated to his own hacker?
The extension of the domainname is not stated, but let's assume it's .fr, as he is french. Then we come up with:
contact:     D***** J****n
address:     18, place de la mairie
address:     07200 Aubenas
country:     FR
phone:       **************
e-mail:      *************
Possible second email: *********
(deleted personal info here for reddit compliance but you are free to do a whois)
And what if we search for taznact? Then this comes up as first result:
Antivirus scan for ... - VirusTotal
SHA256: 6debde863fce2217b8e7e8a58dd948f00c441eb15d5cba30a5a7103d469e07b8. File name: Taznact.exe. Detection ratio: 24 / 47. Analysis date ...
So the domainname tazbox.fr is now linked to not only sha256, but also to a file with the name taznact.exe (same as his email) which most likely contains a virus.
And the virus made me lose my bitcoin.
By the way, he seems to spread his virus through NZB (download website).
Look at his uploaded files: 
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:14:58
Agree .  I'm actually more interested in future employers and law enforcement knowing about this incident
@_date: 2014-06-28 12:53:17
Perhaps you can give me a contact person in aubenas police precinct with official email address.  I have a lot of other info about this character I would love to share with them.  Merci

Sarcasm is lost in the likes of you.  What I was looking for on a paid usenet account is irrelevant to this concern and theft.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:36:37
Does this give fidelity a read only access to the coinbase account or full control of wallets.  If the latter,  then I would be hesitant to allow a second website access to your wallets
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:13:35
Sorry for your loss.  Similar to what I experienced a few years back.  Question - you mentioned running Plex.  Did you also frequent newsgroups and download movie or tv torrents?  Perhaps you downloaded an executable that when you clicked it appeared to do nothing at first.   If so I suspect you downloaded malware that looked for wallets and then maybe set up keyloggers etc,,   In the future I advice anti malware programs like malwarebytes.org and key logger protection.  Anti virus software would do nothing to protect you. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:37:25
Sorry for your loss.  I lost coins several years back and although they went to an address that a hacker on bitcointalk forum had mentioned was his and I was able to DOX him later, I was nevertheless unsuccessful in retrieving them.   He spread malware via usenet files that either took my password via a keylogger or downright took control of my PC.  I was a noob then when it came to security, but it also showed me how amazingly close to cash bitcoin actually is.  If you don't recognize the address your coins went to then they are gone for good.  
I could relate stories of folks that spent 10000 for a cheese pizza etc to try to put your experience in perspective, but I won't because money means a lot to different people and I suspect this was not chump change for you.  It's a brutal lesson. 
Hope you have an opportunity like I did to buy back your coins or invest via proxy like the $GBTC ETF.  Use a hardware wallet next time like trezor or ledger.  I thought the train had left the station when my coins were stolen back at $600 per.  Today it's nearly three times higher.  Who knows where we'll be a year from today. 
File a police report and also with the FBI.  This is grand theft and should be deductible to some extent when you do your taxes.   You'll want the documentation as proof.  
Hope my note is of some use to you.  
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:07:58
Assuming the words were copied down correctly and in the right order then I would simply bypass the pc. Buy a trezor or ledger hardware wallet and upon starting it choose the restore option.   It will ask you to enter the words one by one and will then automatically proceed to initialize.   Only a few seconds.   Entering your words into a pc is risky since a keylogger could intercept and take your coins.
