And then we get into the adoption problems of the barrier for entry being too high for the non tech-savvy user to be their own bank.
If we want mainstream adoption, we need mainstream solutions.  The "non techy" people I know can't even manage to do simple file backups to the cloud...how can we expect them to be their own bank?
I feel like we do actually need some centralized, turnkey services like Coinbase or BTC is going to stay fringe forever.

Its less time than you think.
This is just one example among many:  Even great tools like 1Password can expose their data if you don't control who has root/admin on your system.   For example, 1Password's browser plugin talks to the app over the local loopback interface.  Anyone with root/admin on a system running this plugin can tcpdump the local loopback interface and capture your passwords in the clear.
Keepass is similarly vulnerable to memory inspection (that is more work for sure, but still less than you think).
What you should keep in mind here is that its not like most hackers are doing a cost benefit analysis all the time.  A shitload of black hat hackers just hack shit because its fun and challenging.
I'm not trying to initiate any kind of paranoia here, just open a discussion about the fact that even tools like Truecrypt can be vulnerable on systems where you don't have total access control. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:12:13
For context:  I am a programmer and I work in the network security space. 
I'm not actually suggesting that the average person is at high risk for this, just pointing out that there is an attack surface for *everything*, including crypto vaults and key/password managers.

Please post the transaction ID, or a link to any decent blockchain explorer with the transaction ID.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:35:04
If you don't have total control over who has root/admin on every machine that you ever plug that USB drive into, you are vulnerable to  keyloggers, and tools that inspect/capture the memory of true crypt when you open the volume (same for Keepass and other tools).
Just keep that in mind.

Keep in mind that bitcoin is unregulated (for the most part).
In a new space that is essentially not regulated (or, its regulated at a pretty minimal level for US exchanges)...this is the kind of problem you have when you play in a brand new space this early in the adoption curve.

If the past trend holds, they will see this, help you out, and you will get your funds.
The problem is that they seem to be totally incapable of helping anyone unless it costs them PR on social media.
Find all their twitter handles and start tweeting at them every hour of every day.  That will get their attention.
I left coinbase after their botched BCH rollout and their subsequent actions, especially Brian Armstrong's bullshit support of BCH....I am now convinced they have become bad actors in this space.
In case you think I am bashing them:  Check my post history.  Years of defending them and speaking up on their behalf.

Trading can be super fun and exciting, but you have to understand the game you are playing and who you are up against.
I think taking $100 and treating it like its already gone, and trading that for fun and to learn is a worthwhile endeavor.

I love bitcoin but this is stupid.

* Their recently failed launch into smartphones
This reeks of desperation on their part.
However:  It shows two things for us....
1.  FOMO is a powerful force!
2.  If they perceive that attaching themselves to blockchain tech will boost their stock, that is a strong endorsement of how the space is being viewed in general.

The taxable event does not occur until you do one of the following:    
1. Trade for another crypto    
2. Sell for USD    
3.  Use BTC to buy any good or service.    
What you have to do, and this SUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKSSSSS so fucking hard, is calculate your cost basis for EVERY transaction in the list above that you make.
So lets say you buy 1 BTC at $1000.
1.   You bought BTC and it changes in value = no taxable events yet.
2.   Later, the value rises to $2000, still no taxable event.
3.   You buy a $5 cup of coffee in BTC.   = THIS IS TAXABLE AND YOU ARE COMMITTING TAX FRAUD IF YOU DO NOT REPORT IT.
You have to figure out this equation:
You spent $5 in today's value in BTC.  You have to take the amount of BTC you just spent, and figure out its rise over time, and THAT is your cost basis.
Easier example:
1.  I buy 1 btc at 1000
2.  Value rises to 2000
3.  I spend 1 btc at 2000 to buy a new guitar.
You now have to pay cap gains on:
($2000 - $1000) X 1 BTC = $1000.  
You will owe Capital Gains Tax on the $1000 profit you made.
If the above example was for the sale, or spending of a fraction of a bitcoin: All the math is the same, but you calculate the profit from that fraction of a bitcoin...I used whole numbers here so that it was easier to understand.
NOTE:  There may be tax provisions that exempt transactions of a certain amount form cap gains tax.  Its possible that the $5 purchase above is small enough that it does not matter, or that the law allows for you to have up to X dollars in cap gains that are not taxable.  Please consult with your tax attorney or CPA for more information on how you need to address this for your own tax year.

Better is a very subjective statement.
My mother would not have the first fucking clue what to do with bitcoin.  She can't even understand the difference between a browser and the internet.   She is a great example of someone for whom bitcoin would be a horrible gift.  Not only would it turn me into her personal Crypto IT department, but she is 100% guaranteed to fuck herself over if she tried.
So for her, it would be WAY better to give her a visa gift card.
But for friends of mine who have enough technical acumen to handle it, bitcoin is a great gift.

@_date: 2018-01-03 03:26:03
Exactly.  
I hate to say it, but the reason i buy and hold instead of buy and spend, is just that i am scared of making an honest mistake (me or my tax guy, cause this shit is not super clear at all) and getting fucked by the long dick of the irs.  
Fuck us, right?  I hate this aspect of crypto so much.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:21:35
Yes.  
So if you sell btc for eth (random example), you have to pay cap gains on the usd value of the btc at time of sale.  The fact that you then (the way they see it) instantly bought ltc doesnt matter, because buying property is not a taxable event.

When my wife accidentally threw out my 24 word seed.
I had taken it out of secure storage to hammer the words into a metal plate for long term storage...when she decided to clean the house while I was at work.  
This was ENTIRELY MY FAULT.  I should never have left it around for her to find like that.
At the same time:  My Trezor was out of date.  So when I reconnected it....it needed a firmware upgrade.  
So my security model failed bigtime, and I ended up doing a firmware upgrade on a hot hardware wallet with NO seed backup!!!!!  I was literally nauseous for the entire process.
That was the most nerve wracking firmware upgrade of my life and it was just dumb luck that I didn't lose my coins.
Never again.
Now my wallet runs on both a Ledger S and a Trezor and they aren't stored together.  The seed is stored more securely than before and only I can access it.
That was the worst.  This was a long time ago when the price was FAR lower...but it was still a truly horrible feeling that I hope to never experience again.
Update:  I did NOT lose my coins.  The Trezor update worked and I was able to transfer my coins to an Electrum wallet, recreate a totally new wallet on my Trezor, and move them back safely.

Then don't buy it?
I'm not trying to be a jerk, but really....if you look at bitcoin and you say "this is untenable"...then either sell, or fight to fix it?
I don't really understand the tone in here lately.  Its like we all just made a shitload of profit and suddenly its not good enough for anyone.
What I really don't understand is instead of contacting devs, volunteering your time, etc....people just fight about it on reddit and other forums I shouldn't name.

It will all settle in a week or so.  Coinbase just kinda botched the rollout of BCH and they are really struggling because it scared people so a TON of people are pulling funds and coin out just in case its going to be a long pain in the ass.
I have personal faith that CB will get back to speed fast, but they lost a bunch of trust today from longtime users like myself who now question their decision making.
Please do form your own opinion though.  Lots of panic and FUD right now because new investors aren't used to this.  I've been in this shit for a long time now and I just roll with the tide.  I moved some funds off of CB/GDAX for now just to be safe, but I didn't cancel my weekly buy...

For the first few years, the micro USB cables that shipped with the Trezor were super flaky.  If you search this forum or you can find a TON of stories that start with "My Trezor died!" or "Trezor Bridge won't work!" and 80% of the time the resolution was to replace the cable.

I get that the brand new investors are like "WTF????" but I expected a HUGE dip and I'm surprised we haven't seen it yet.
Historically, the dips after a rise like this are to almost 50% of what the peak was...this is a very healthy and necessary correction that reflects real issues with the network.

I was in a zone where it wasn't super healthy, so I just unplugged.
LOL that was like 8 months ago that I plugged back in...you can imagine my shock when it had been on an upward trend almost the entire time.
If you believe in BTC, I mean really believe, you should be able to walk away and not look back.  Either that or you are overinvested.
It totally reset my perspective.  Now I'm like a person who knows they are already dead...no more fear of dying.  
I've been able to totally view this BCH nonsense from an arm's length and even though I had/have funds on CB, I was able to calmly move them off without losing a cent.

The fees scale proportionately with the pressure on the network...of course you have never seen fees like this, because the network has never operated at this capacity.
Also:  Bigger blocks will not stop the fees from scaling with the network load.  That scaling is a vital part of the design of the blockchain/bitcoin network.  Miners will always try to fill blocks and there will always be more TX than space to fill at any one time, leading to congestions and a rise in fees.  Higher fees encourage more mining, which then drives the fees back down as the TX load begins to clear.
Scaling fees are a feature, not a bug.
But this WILL get better as the network becomes more efficient (Segwit is a good start!).

Its a pain because every purchase is a taxable event, which sucks, but I believe that the US is working on legislation to limit that to only purchases above X dollars (I heard 500 floated as a limit).
Example:  For instance, imagine you bought a $3,500 bedroom set at Overstock.com using half a bitcoin (or 50 million “satoshis”) that you purchased for $200 at the start of 2016. That represents a capital gain of $3,300. At the typical 15% long-term capital gains rate, that works out to a $495 tax hit.

I believe your first step should be to open a support case with the exchange you used.  Coinbase is good about helping their customers with stuff like this.  
The other option is to contact a wallet recovery service.  There is a guy who does this for redditors and has proven he can be trusted.  Since you have all the keys, its possible he could figure out how to fix this???

I believe its because the cost of a transaction is actually the number of inputs, not the amount of BTC.  If you are moving, say 1 BTC fragmented from 1000 input addresses, that is a WAY more "expensive" operation mathematically than if you move 10BTC from a single input address.
So, depending on how coinbase is doing the calculation, I believe it may be related to the input addresses used for the transfer?

Stating that "bitcoin will fail" seems pretty hyperbolic.
Here is how I see this succeeding:
* Bitcoin stays as the main chain for storing value and pushing huge TXs.
* Other alt-coins that are faster, develop to fill the void in the space for making small, fast purchases.
* The main anchor, the store of value will remain BTC.

The short answer is:  Not really.
The steps that you would need to take to actually prevent yourself from that level of intrusion are not only impossible for anyone who has a sub-genius IQ and a LOT of resources, they would require you to make a level of sacrifice that you would almost certainly not be willing to make.

I just tested these steps and they work:




That should find the correct files, but will also give you some "permission denied" messages for other files unless you use "sudo", but I recommend against using sudo here.  Just ignore the warnings.
To delete them:


Then repeat the find and you should see they have been destroyed:


No need with this method to clear the Recycle Bin.
One more thing:  If you use a timemachine backup system, its possible that doing a time machine restore will put these files back onto your system.
You can exclude /tmp from being part of Time Machine by adding that path to your advanced settings under Time Machine, but I think it will not do anything about previous time machine restore points which may have captured this data.
Just keep this in mind if you roll back via time machine, you may have to repeat the purge of these files.

I actually prefer this kind of transparent cost model, to one where you amortize all the costs into the base price of the product, but I know that many people do not.
Last time this was discussed, a guy came in an lambasted a retailer for doing exactly what you are doing, saying it would alienate customers and drive away business.
As a customer, I personally would rather know that I have to pay a fee like that on a certain payment method, than wonder if I pay in bitcoin, if part of the cost was to cover other's use of more expensive payment methods, but I may be in the minority on that.

Ok, I'm going to explain it, on the assumption that you are not actually just trying to troll bait me into an argument.
There is a very well known stereotype of person, formed from the most vocal and outspoken members of the Anarcho Capatalist movement.  This stereotype is of someone who has completely bought into the "the free market will solve every problem, government creates every problem" mindset.
I'm actually fairly anti-statist myself, but I cannot stomach what I call the "lunatic fringe" members of the AnCap movement.
Many of those members are devoted followers of an online philosopher that I named in my previous post (who I will refer to as SM for brevity), who runs a web community called FreedomainRadio (FDR for short).
While I actually think that SM has a lot of good ideas (peaceful parenting, socratic method, examination of moral virtues in every day life), I feel he also has a lot of patently dangerous and super manipulative ideas also.  He tends to attract followers in all flavors from the very smart and reasonable, to those who are highly subject to a cult-like mentality.
Some of those people, of the cult-like mentality variant, are extremely extremely vocal on boards like this, and literally cannot stop themselves from taking every single opportunity to turn any conversation into one about their own view of the world.  Its seen a lot in but also in other webforums too.
This stereotype (the lunatic fringe anarcho-capatalist) is one that I would love to see in that video, because its already so ripe for parody.
I'm going to wrap this up now, I hope that my point was clear.  
If you have never heard of the people I'm talking about, rather than send you a bunch of links, I'll just tell you that you aren't missing much.  Highlights include the idea that you should defoo (sever all ties with your friends and family members who don't share 100% extreme devotion to the anarcho-capatalist movement), and that women are responsible for all evil in the world because they are choosing assholes to breed with.  If you are suffering from an ocular spasm due to extreme eye rolling at either of those ideas, you get the point.

Quick mental math, there are approximately 95 possible characters used in a strong password (upper case letters + lower case letters + numerals + special characters).
If we do the math on a strong, randomly generated password (such as Keepass might generate) of length 24:
95^24 ~= 2.92 X 10 ^ 47
at ~~43,000~~ (editing my math in response to OP's corrected figure) 420 attempts per second, this takes ((95^24) / 420 / 60):
~1.16 X 10 ^ 43 minutes.

This is a healthy concern.
Gox was an absolute clusterfuck on every level. 
Setting aside their horrific lack of code control and coding standards, just the fact that they never once agreed to a proper proof-of-reserves audit was a big big red flag.
I think Gox changed the community permanently.  Everyone is now demanding proof of reserves and more transparency from vendors like Coinbase, and from exchanges also.
Examples:  
However, as Danny Bradbury pointed out, this isn't enough on its own:
I think the fact that the community ethos is now "Trust must be earned via independent audit" is a sign that we will not have another Gox, in the same form.
I'm not saying that people won't lose money again (good lord, look at the BFL debacle), but I don't think we will have another Gox in the same or similar form to how Gox occurred.

Yes, you can use a tool called TC to initiate strict rate limiting on the interface that is being used for the traffic (probably your only interface but some boxes have more than one NIC).
I have a rate limiter script that I use for applications like this, its generic and then needs to be invoked with the correct parameters.
Posting it here is a nightmare due to the formatting, so I put it up on Pastebin:
I usually am rate shaping from a box to a particular IP (like to an inline router, which would let me shape all the traffic to one router, but keep another NIC on a different router untouched), so you will have to slightly modify this if you want to just shape ALL traffic in/out of an entire interface...but I start it like this:
./rate_limiter.sh start $IP_to_shape_to $interface 100kbps
That example above would initiate a rate limit of 100Kbps from the $interface to the $IP_to_shape_to.  You could use this behind a router and it would rate limit your linux box on that interface to the router in question.
You can learn more by reading about the TC tool and how HTB limiting works.
I haven't had to use this yet on a bitcoin node, but you an play with it and see how/if it works for you.
To stop the rate limiting, you just call it with "stop":
./rate_limiter.sh stop

I would suggest (and I'm not a coinbase hater, the opposite actually):
1.  Move it to a secure HD wallet like Electrum if you want to spend the coins soon.  
2.  Move it to a hardware wallet like Trezor if you want to hold it for a while.
3.  Move it to the Coinbase Multi-Sig vault (where you own the keys) or their regular Vault for enhanced protection.  The multisig vault is best, the regular vault requires dual authorization and has a 48 hour delay on transfers for added security.
4.  NEVER NEVER enable the API in your coinbase account security settings.

Coinbase vault has a 48 hour delay and requires multiple email account confirmations.
In theory, if your security is compromised, you should be able to stop an outgoing conbase vault transfer before the funds leave the vault.
If your security is compromised with an electrum wallet, the coins are instantly transferred to the thief's address and there is no stopping the transfer.
I'm NOT saying that coinbase vault is superior to a properly managed secure wallet like Electrum where YOU own the keys.
But I do feel its probably the most secure storage method where the coins are not directly in your possession (but since it supports multisig, you CAN keep control even when coinbase has your coins in its vault).
Note that the coinbase wallet does not have these additional security measures.  The Vault is for people who want more security and don't mind having the 48 hour delay on outbound transfers.
Coinbase also keeps 97% of all coins in secure cold storage and their hot wallet is insured, so they are leading the industry in terms of coin storage.

Yes, absolutely I do feel that payment method would NOT dissuade them in any way.
Shady gyms with shady business practices existed long before "just bill my credit card" was the norm, and they will persist long after everyone is using cryptocurrency instead of CC or fiat.
I'm not trying to bash you, but its so blindly optimistic to think that payment method is going to discourage this kind of shady billing, because it absolutely wont.
Why do you think that shady businesses like this rely on contracts?
Its because if they didn't have a contact to bind you, you could just report your card stolen and they would have NO way to continue to screw you over.
They use contracts so that even if you change your bank/credit card info, they can still get money from you in the form of selling your debt to a collections agency for $0.50 on the dollar.

Everyone knew about it, but no one was really allowed to discuss it (for obvious reasons, the children were young when this happened, probably age 5-6).

The code is all open source and you have guys like johoe using it, so you can bet that a LOT of very smart people have privately audited the code at this point.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:00:19


True, but its very possible that if your transaction is sent with zero fee, it can be ignored by miners and it may eventually never be picked up and confirmed.
For example, if you tried to send a very large transaction with a ton of inputs and zero fee, its very likely it would get ignored.
There are heuristics on how to calculate an appropriate transaction fee that have been discussed before.

**But please people, before you sudo a script from the internet, please do try to understand what it does and what you are doing when you run that script.**
If its a "disposable" VM out in the cloud, then the damage is mitigated a bit, but still, if someone hacked github (or hit you with a MITM attack, especially if you are on TOR) and replaced that script with malicious code, you could end up copying it onto your system and executing god-knows-what.
**At least break it up:**
$*cd ~*
$*wget -O ./btcNode.sh 
$*cat ./btcNode.sh*
*{now read the output and if you see things you don't understand, research them.  If you see commands you know you don't want, such as the invocation to "passwd" to change the current user's password, comment it out or remove it}*
Finally, once you know what ./btcNode.sh does, then you can run (assuming you are a non-root user):
$*sudo bash btcNode.sh*
Or if you are running as root already:
$*bash btcNode.sh*

Yeah, I have a bitcoin node running on a cloud hosted machine with 30GB of storage and in about 4-5 months the blockchain will be too big for it, and I'll need to upgrade to a bigger and more expensive machine.
It kinda makes me wonder if we might ever end up dedicating smaller machines to hosting the first XGB of the blockchain and having other nodes entirely that host the rest?
Is that a crazy/broken idea?
I can imagine a situation in the future where we have a series of dedicated nodes that host signed bootstraps and the first N GB of the blockchain, and other, more powerful nodes that are dedicated to hosting the more recent parts of the chain (parts that are presumably being requested more frequently).

Start an Ubuntu box and run this script, the node will be fully operational as soon as the box reboots (assuming you are not behind an ASA or firewall that needs to be configured to let the traffic pass).
As always, examine this script very carefully before you run it (since you cannot necessarily trust me from your POV), but I run two nodes from this script, one in the Netherlands and one in the Bay Area SF.

Yes they are on the path to going fully open source.
I agree that you need TWO layers of encryption (The wallet itself, and then also encryption in storage and transfer).
My current setup is a spideroak for my cloud holding my encrypted wallet files, plus an offline backup of the same in a safe deposit box.
I only store smaller amounts on the cloud wallet, so that the risk is mitigated but I still retain an easy level of access.

This from the guy who says you should defoo (sever ties with your friends and family) if they do not agree in full anarcho-capatilism.
Its really hard to take Stephen seriously on any topic once you see some of the darker views he has and spreads to his followers.
Combine that with the fact that [he violates HIS OWN UPB non-aggression principal by abusing DMCA takedown mechanisms]( to silence his critics on Youtube....and I really cannot take his views on politics or the government, or the future of bitcoin seriously.
His views on Peaceful Parenting are pretty solid, but his views on government are extremely unbalanced*.
* I do realize that I am using a "poisioning the well" fallacy here, to a certain extent.  However, I think in many cases, there is a certain level of merit to looking the the central outlook of a person on the specific topic (such as government and the role/value of the state) when one is evaluating the opinions (*not logical arguments, those can and should be evaluated on their own merit*) of a person on that topic.  For example, if I say that the government is going to regulate bitcoin out of existence, and I don't provide proof for that claim, its relevant for you to ask "what is your view on government overall that may influence this rather baseless assertion".  
What he says here is essentially his opinion:


And like all opinions, its open to critique through the lens of "what is the outlook and what are the beliefs of the person who is sharing this opinion".

Their Vault has a deliberate 48 hour delay as a security feature.

I hope I was not coming off as a fan of Western Union, I think they are a terrible company.
But lets be real:  Many of the people who use Western Union on a frequent basis lack the means and understanding to replace it with Bitcoin.  If you are paying your bills every month via Western Union because you aren't responsible enough to maintain a bank account in good standing, you are definitely not a good candidate to use bitcoin.
The "bread and butter" of Western Union are people living check to check who cannot keep a bank account in good standing.  Bitcoin is not offering those people a compelling solution at this time.

@_date: 2014-12-31 20:10:57
Its possible.
If anything, I suspect we will see two kinds of statements:
1.  Guilt by association:  "In the world of crypto currencies, where scams are frequent and common, yet another type of digital currency has crumbled in a fraudulent scam, as Paycoin and its owner fall into the red, similar to the Mt.Gox fraud of Bitcoin 18 months ago..."
2.  A positive contrast:  "People got sucked into buying a new and fraudulent crypto currency called Paycoin, by trading their Bitcoin for mining that was not happening, and being paid back in a ponzi coin that never had any real value".
If its the latter, and not the former, it may actually end up looking ok for Bitcoin, but I'm not holding my breath.

I'm only asking that people take into strong consideration IF its actually a good idea for any given person they are trying to convince, to adopt.
It may very much be in the best interests of a person to adopt, or not...but doing the due-dilligence of figuring that out is a responsibility that should be addressed for anyone who is convincing others to adopt.

That is how I interpreted it, but I think we would need someone from the Spideroak team to come in and verify for certain.
This idea of only sending the deltas is very common in video encoding (I frames vs P frames), and I believe that apple's Time Machine uses a similar style of change storage to prevent the time machine backup size from growing too aggressively.
Also, sending the deltas is of course, much safer than sending the entire file every time...although if the traffic is properly encrypted, it *should* not matter...but "should" is the operative word here.
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:46:33
After you pointed me to some reference material in a different thread, I did a LOT of reading on Paycoin/Hashcoin/Hashlets/Primes/GAW scams and HOLY SHIT that entire enterprise is one giant scam fest.
What is crazy is that its an **OBVIOUS** scam and its so sad to see so many people getting sucked into it.  My buddy is all about it right now and I'm trying so hard to get him to pull back on the stick but he is just nosediving into buying cloud hashpower to mine paycoin.
Now that the $20 paycoin promise has been defaulted on, I think I will have some more success in getting him to cash out of paycoin and at least get back into bitcoin.
The only altcoin I have messed with, was Litecoin, which I put like $20 into a very long time ago, forgot about, and to my astonishment:  Its worth over $400usd now (my $20 worth, not the price of ltc vs usd).   I think very soon I will cash out of LTC and convert it to BTC, because now that home mining of LTC is no longer meeting ROI, I think it is a doomed coin.  Being able to mine it on a basic GPU was THE thing that LTC had going for it (other than the lightning fast confirmation times which I admit are very satisfying to see in action).
Thanks for the info.

One more point to mention:  NEVER send the 2FA verification SMS to a phone that has google voice enabled, or it can be intercepted if your google account is compromised.
2FA is most secure with Authy, Google Authenticator, or another crypto based service.  Its less so when done via SMS, since many providers will show you text logs if you are able to login to your account via the web.
I.e. - If you 2FA to your Verizon phone, and your verizon password is weak, that is a huge weak point in your security.

I'm a happy user and supporter of Coinbase, and I agree they should address this privacy issue.
**EDIT:  I just tested this using CURL with my own username and I got a 404 every time.  I tried both my full username, containing the " suffix and just the bare username before the   Both queries resulted in a 404 from Coinbase.  I also logged into servers at my work and did the query via WGET just in case it could have been a curl vs wget issue and I got the same thing:  404 with my own, known working username.**

I think a product like the Trezor, on a secure chip, at the price point of a Raspberry Pi, that can accept a very small USB keyboard will be a game changer.
The Trezor is incredible, I own one...but I think when you can get one for around $35-$40 (which should be possible), its going to really improve the security for the average user.
This might not be a "big event" to some, but it would be a huge leap forward for the community.

Remember that with increased backups, you have increased risk vectors.
The Trezor is, until proven otherwise, un-hackable.  So far no one has seen proof of successful key extraction from a Trezor.
Get a Trezor, keep N paper copy backups of the 24 word seed, where N is the number you are comfortable with, and call it a day.

Its about steady payouts.
If you are mining on a low GH/s miner, you might mine for months and NEVER get any pay out at all.   
By joining a pool, you are guaranteed to see a steady return on your investment (minus fees of course).
Its like the difference between a pure commission sales job, and a salary position.  People are glad to trade a bit of fees for the steady payouts.

Yes.  You can get the mpk from the mytrezor site when your trezor is attached.  Click on your wallet on the left side of the screen and then the advanced button, it will expose your mpk.   The mpk can be loaded into any app which supports mpks.

As I mentioned, I do hope that OB succeeds, I just have some reservations about how it will succeed without becoming a target for various government agencies, including the IRS.  
I figure that the people who may attempt grey/black market sales and buys on OB will be a mixture of the incredibly stupid, and those who believe they have really amazing operational security.  Some will probably get caught, others may avoid capture, but it makes me wonder what kind of response it may trigger from authorities.

I have my 24 word seed stamped onto a piece of aluminum, held in a safe deposit box at the bank.  Its safe to both fire and flood.
If you want to take it to the next level, you put 12 words on each of two such plates and keep each plate at a different safe deposit box at two different banks.
Fire?  Check.

Sure that totally makes sense.
I'm going to assume that if a $100 Trezor is too much, then a laptop or PC that you keep offline is probably off limits for you also.
If you want to make this a long term investment, then I recommend you use a service that will let you make a secure paper wallet like this one:
Follow the steps to carefully boot a PC offline via Ubuntu and print your own paper wallet, use the paper wallet for your long term storage.
But you had better have a damned good plan to hide that paper wallet and protect it from moisture, fire, and theft.

Incorrect, it is essentially impossible to get to the private keys inside a trezor because they are *passphrase* encrypted ~~with the PIN.~~ and also access is blocked via the PIN. (If you enable passphrase encryption in the setup process).
There is no "no password" option on a Trezor.  Its a 24 word seed to generate the private keys and then a custom length PIN code that you input on a rotating keypad, displayed only on the Trezor so that even a mouse/keylogger canot reverse engineer the pin.

Its in the protocol:
As of v0.8.2 of bitcoin core, dust is defined as 5430 satoshis.  I believe that prior to v0.8.2, it ws 534 satoshis and they shifted it by one decimal place to avoid spam/dust more aggressively (as the value of bitcoin grew, it made sense to make the minimum amount higher...I mean...who really needs to send someone $0.00001 anyway?).
Any transaction whose value is less than 5430 satoshis will not be relayed by the bitcoin core or mined.
What happens if you send a transaction smaller than the dust limit?
Basically, you can manually broadcast those transactions via your own node, but eventually they will go unconfirmed for long enough that they will never end up on the blockchain and your wallet will drop them when it syncs up with the blockchain.
I had those "1enjoysochi" dust transactions (probably over 100 of them) in one of my addresses and I had to wait a while, but eventually they all disappeared.

Because the *network* IS decentralized.
Bitcoin is MORE than just mining pools.

I think this is the kind of statement that causes the rest of the investment/economic community to look at bitcoin enthusiasts and say "those guys are crazy".
I'm not defending the corruption in fiat currency schemes, but being a fiat currency does not mean that the real value of all fiat is zero.  It means the paper is worthless, but that is really not the point I think you were trying to make.
Its true that without the US GOV existing, paper dollars would be fairly worthless, but OPEC is not the only thing standing in the way of the buying power of the dollar going to zero.
GDP, CPI, and other factors like the value of a country's industrial production go into currency valuation.

Strongly disagree.
Circle and Coinbase are doing just fine, and they are absolutely necessary for adoption to increase.
You simply cannot have wider adoption if the barrier for entry is a high degree of computer knowledge and the willpower to maintain total responsibility for your own security vs hackers and theft.
I agree that BCI is fucking up.  I don't trust them, and I don't recommend them.
But you cannot put all "web wallets" into the same category.
I even stated in another post, before this thread, that BCI is a detriment to the bitcoin ecosystem that this point.
But a witchhunt against all "web wallets" is simply not productive.
Mainstream adoption is absolutely predicated on people buying, storing, and transferring bitcoin with EASE and without having to attain an IT/programmer level of knowledge.
If you want that to happen, secure businesses like Coinbase and Circle must succeed.

I'm just asking because they have adjusted their security protocols over time, and I'm wondering if this is still the case.

Yeah actually most collections works like this:
Business X has a legally enforceable debt from customer Y, in the amount of Z.
Business X tries to collect, and fails.
Business X goes to Collection Agency and says "I have a debt of Z dollars, what will you offer me for it?".
Collection Agency says "I will pay you right now one fifth* of Z, and whatever we are able to collect is ours".
*One fifth is a realistic example.  The actual amount depends on the age of the debt, the nature of the debt, and other factors like the state laws that person Y lives in.
Business X says "Ok, we agree on that price, the debt is yours".
There is no further transaction.  Collections is a one way transfer of debt as a product.  If collections is unable to collect, they eat the cost of what they bought the debt for.

My node has been running stable on Vultr for weeks and weeks now.  The only hiccup I had was they had to do a mandatory reboot of some systems, but by the time I got the email, my VPS was back up and running and I had like 47 connections to the bitcoin network again.

You are still making statements as fact, without any specific source, except a wiki link that states how collections may work in general.
If I concede your first point that the costs may be different, we still have not put any measurable, empirical amount on the difference of cost.  
That which has been stated without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence, can it not?
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:45:15
Yeah, that makes sense.
Coinbase is leveraging that behavior to make transfers between users, and between user's wallets and their Vault accounts work instantly...those transactions never move across the actual blockchain.
Although, I believe that if you move money to one of their Multi-Sig Vault accounts, that DOES have to get broadcast onto the blockchain, because their multi-sig vault is a true multi-sig implementation where you own the keys and they do not.

And the hypothetical you are drawing is that if bitcoin was around, they would have been better off?   I disagree completely.  A public ledger of all transactions is exactly the kind of tool the nazis would have used against the jews and their supporters.   
"We see you sent coins to this address of a known jew.   You and your family must come with us"
If you didnt know:   The nazis would only have been able to identify 1-2 million jews on their own.  It was a detIled ledger of family geneology provided by the catholic church that allowed the nazi party to identify the other four million.  
Bitcoin would have been a tool for the nazis, not for their victims.

Big +1 for Trezor.
OP if you aren't ready to drop $100+ on a Trezor, then install Electrum from Electrum.org.  Verify the checksum (I can show you how to do this if you need, just ask), and then send the coins from Coinbase to your Electrum wallet.  Be sure to back up the SEED on paper and keep it somewhere VERY safe, like a bank safe deposit box.
Other options:  The Coinbase Multi-Sig vault will allow you to keep control of your own keys, but still have the easy of use that comes with Coinbase.
You can also use Coinbase to purchase coins directly into your coinbase multi-sig vault, which is another option you may wish to consider.

I just thought that I would mention the "500f" claim, because red locktite is amazing stuff, but its really not as "semi-permanent" as they claim on the site.  I've never ever needed heat to remove a bolt/nut that was secured with red locktite.

Trezor is currently the best-in-class HW wallet, in that its very secure and totally open source.

I personally really like it for converting fiat to BTC.
I don't store coins on coinbase, I manage my own security.
I have no personal issue handing them information about me, but I believe that we ultimately need different types of services for bitcoin to thrive.
I fully understand that the privacy issue is a dealbreaker for some people, and for those people, there is localbitcoins and other less invasive methods of purchase.
For me though, I love the ability to instant buy in 30 seconds, have the coins appear in my wallet in literally less than a minute, and transfer them out to (for example) my Trezor.  My coins are out in the cloud for less than a minute, its great for me.

Just fyi:  Your claim about locktite red is wrong.
It comes off easily with any tool.  I have applied it to maybe 100+ fasteners on my motorcycles and it is in no way, a physical barrier to removal of those parts.
It could be removed with a dental pick easily, and then reapplied.  
Heat is not needed at all.

I have always just sent bitcoin from my online wallet to my QT wallet.
You just go to Receive on the BitcoinQT client, grab the public receiver address for your QT wallet and then send BTC to that address from your online wallet.
Usually it takes 20-30 minutes to get the first confirmation unless you pay for the transaction to move up in the queue.
You can see the transaction status through the bitcoin QT client under Transactions and also you can just type in the same public receiver address into blockchain.info and watch the transaction that way.

Its a premined scam coin created by Josh Garza, who owns the already scammy GAW miner company.
Basically:  He created Paycoin as its own coin, that can only be mined* with his cloud mining platform.  He promised a $20 floor on the price via "$100 million in funding from private VC firms" and did not deliver, instead the coin trades at $12 usd (as of a few days ago, haven't checked the price today).
Here is the post where Garza says "I know I promised you $20, but you will settle for $12 because fuck you" (my words, not his):
Its worth nothing, its entirely a ponzi scheme and when the exodus from this coin is over, he will probably be up on federal fraud charges.
If you are ready for a LONG read, here is a 500 page thread with basically every detail on this scam:

The local WU place in my town has a line of mostly black people out the door, every payday.  The local check cashing places are all in the poorest, "blackest" parts of town.
This was covered in numerous articles and publications that center around the high cost of being poor, remittance and bill payment are HUGE industries that mostly feed off of people who are poor and don't use banks.
People in a position like that, stand to benefit the most from this technology, and they need someone they can relate to, to help open their eyes to this new world.  I guarantee you, someone working 60 hour double shifts just to feed 4 kids as a single parent is NOT spending their "free" time on they might catch a youtube video every now and then on their phone if someone says "Hey you gotta check this shit out".

Tip 100 bits @_date: 2014-12-03 19:15:36


I know I'll get downvoted for this, but yes, and I'll explain why.
First a few points:
1.  I use coinbase to buy coins, because it is by far the most convenient way for me to do this.  I am too introverted and too paranoid to use localbitcoins, so for me, its the best method to convert fiat to BTC.
2.  I do not use coinbase as a trading platform or a hot wallet.  Once I get coins from them, they get moved to offline cold storage in one of the industry leading, open source wallets.  
3.  I do actually have trust in Coinbase, mostly because they have taken great steps to show that 97% of their coins are in offline cold storage, and their hot wallet is insured.  Without this, I would not have been able to trust them.
4.  If we want adoption to grow, we need to remember that not all users should be crypto enthusiasts and computer experts.  Widespread adoption will be blocked if it is predicated on having to even understand the true benefits of Open Source software.  Casual users WANT bank like entities they can trust!  
5.  While I agree that bank-like entities seem to be antithetical to the original mission of bitcoin, the fact is that bitcoin is more than large enough to support all of us.  The hardcore folks can buy coins via services like localbitcoins and stay as far off the grid as possible.  The semi hardcore folks can do what I do, where they use a service like Coinbase or Circle to buy coins and then immediately transfer those coins to their own possession and take responsibility for their storage.  The casuals can just treat bitcoin like fiat and keep their assets in bank like entities and never have to worry about the complexities of managing their own wallets.
What I really don't think is healthy, is this (and I'm not accusing you of this particularly op, I think its a general ethos that much of the community seems to have) attitude that somehow, if you like Coinbase or Circle, or keep your coins on Blockchain.info, you are somehow "using bitcoin wrong" or "working against the mission of bitcoin".
That is the kind of hubris that will turn people with a casual interest away from bitcoin and away from online communities like this, and that ultimately slows adoption and helps to keep bitcoin out of the hands of those who truly NEED to use it (for example, people disenfranchised from banks such as those in Africa and South America).
Bitcoin is big enough to support all of us, from the hardcore to the casual, and I think its important to help educate people on the technology and the risks/benefits of various storage and purchase methods, without beating them over the head because they are "doing it wrong".
Lets use the carrot, rather than the stick to help guide people toward usage that makes the most of the trust-less nature of Bitcoin, if that is our mission.

The problem we have is that often, government regulation is poorly implemented, and corrupt, which only feeds the AnCap hysteria.
Consumer protections and anti-monopoly laws ARE what is needed.

Invoking and using an onscreen keybaord to unlock KeePass would protect you from this, I think.  All a logger would get is mouse clicks. 
I may start doing that, just as an extra precaution.
Looked into this:
Keepass 2.X supports secure desktop for entering the passphrase, so that has a lot of resistance to keyloggers.
KeepassX does not support this, but Keepass 2.X latest DOES support OSX, so I'm in the process of switching my login archive over to Keepass 2.X for both M$ and OSX.

I did a little math:
Your current spendable balance is the sum of the last three rows in your account table:
0.01 + 0.0047 + 0.00010759 ~= 0.0148
My guess is that the transaction was not picked up, and so Multibit sent the bitcent from one of your receiver addresses (the one with 0.52), and since the transaction has not been processed, the change from the transaction has not yet been sent back to the change address that Multibit has provided for the transaction (Electrum does the same thing, in that it chooses which receiver address to send funds from).
This would explain your current "spendable" balance.
As for the transaction:  I believe if its not picked up eventually, I believe it will (someone correct me here) end up back in the receiver address that it came from in your wallet (the one with 0.52).
I have seen very small transactions like this get held up for as long as 5 days before, until eventually the funds ended up back in the wallet.
If you don't want to wait, you can follow multibit's steps here, to reset the transaction:
Or you can use blockchain.com to rebroadcast the transaction:
I know that Electrum gives you a "Send from this address" option as a right click on your receiver addresses (Receive tab, right click on an address and use "send from"), that will allow you to manually choose what address you send the funds from...you may wish to see if Multibit has this also, as it would result in less of your funds being held up when something like this happens.
I hope this helps.

Yes, I just heard of these.  It looks promising, but you have to use software to generate the QR code, so that is one more semi-complex step since the software must be run on an offline/isolated computer instance that must be wiped before it it re-connected to the web.
In the case of a paper wallet, you have to have such a setup anyway, so its a great choice.
In the case of a Trezor seed, its an extra set of steps that is unnecessary versus this method, so its nice to have both options.

It might not sound like much, but that is typical, and when you combine that across your bills, your average poor person who has become disenfranchised from the banking system will probably spend $20 at month at a MINIMUM just on bill payment.
That is $240 a year.
Now multiply that across the millions upon millions of poor people in the US alone and its easy to see why companies like Western Union are predatory and shitty businesses.
Same for check cashing places, payday loan places, and those title loan places.
When people talk about Bitcoin changing the world, this is the  most important use case in my opinion, freeing poorer people from the predatory environment that preys on them.  Either you bend over at a bank, or you bend over for Western Union...and bitcoin can potentially change all of this.

My guess is, no.
It seems like the only way to really gather this data would involve a compromise of privacy that would be antithetical to bitcoin...and yet it seems like it would be hugely beneficial to the bitcoin community if we were able to anonymously mine this data and produce metrics to analyze how much theft is actually happening.

Its been a crappy year for the *price* but a very good year for adoption, mainstream interest, support of major corporations like Microsoft/Time/Dell, and overall its been a great year for the HEALTH of bitcoin.
$1200 was a bubble, created by a mixture of bots driving the price and trade volume up, and hysteria due to the exploding price.  We had an insane volume of Long options put out by traders and on every long, there is a short on the other side that has to be resolved.
The falling price this year needed to happen in order to get Bitcoin back on its true organic growth curve, and the fact that it stabilized in the low $300s is a sign that we are probably at or near the bottom of this correction.
I expect to see (read: hope) very gradual growth in 2015, starting in the spring, to maybe $400-$500 by the end of 2015, and a pretty good ramp up in 2016 when the block reward gets cut in half and the miners have way less coins to dump straight back onto the market.
This year was rough for people who bought in above $300 and wanted to make fast money, but it was necessary.

It seems like, from the review, I see two big issues:
1.  You input the pin on the computer = vulnerable to keyloggers.
2.  The computer displays the 24 word seed = vulnerable to screen capture.
I feel like these guys should have taken these vulnerabilities into account the way Trezor did.  (The trezor has its own screen that shows you the seed words, and the pin is typed via a "blind box" where the mapping of each digit is ONLY shown on the trezor itself, so even a keylogger cannot get the pin from the pin creation sequence).
Its hard to understand why this would succeed when there is already a device on the market that addresses these issues...but competition is great and the more competition we have in the hardware wallet space, the better.

And I'm small time for sure.  I personally know guys who are prepped with 10x-100x what I have.  Most of them make VERY good money and are ex military or ex LEO and they are literally just waiting for the shit to hit the fan.
Most serious preppers own land and already have a group of similarly minded preppers formed, with the necessary skill sets (a real group includes at least one person with surgical training, at least one person with military training like army infantry or marine core with at least 1 deployment, someone who is an expert at gardening, and usually a comms person like a HAM radio operator).
If you want to learn more, I *highly* recommend a book called Patriots, its one of the "bibles" of modern survival prepping.  Its a piece of survival fiction, but its actually a blueprint for how to start a group and how to make a plan that *might* allow you to survive a hyperinflation based collapse of the USGOV.
I don't actually think the US gov will ever collapse in my lifetime, so its fair to say that I'm not "drinking the koolaid" like many/most preppers do, but after Katrina, I realized that FEMA and the Fed can't protect a warm cup of piss, and I became determined to build a plan for mysef and my wife that would give us a fighting chance to get out alive.

If the price was actually FLAT for 5 years it would be a huge signal that either something is very wrong, or the price is being deliberately manipulated to be flat.
Bitcoin is deflationary in nature.  What we should expect to see is slow, organic growth that is not super volatile, and is impacted by factors like the block reward getting cut in half in 2016.
You can have growth and low volatility, but wanting the price to be FLAT is kinda like saying that a person's heartrate shouldn't rise when they exercise...if that happened, that person would be in serious trouble.

If you think that a payment method discourages businesses from writing fine print into contracts that people barely read, you are really not seeing the truth of the matter.
Payment method has NOTHING to do with a contract that you sign which makes you legally / contractually bound to pay a certain fee.
If they can't bill you, they will just send it to collections.

Considering someone committed code for Blockchain.info that called Math.Random() for a crypto application, it would seem that more people need to understand the difference between psuedo-random number generation and crypto secure psuedo random number generation.

Can you post the transaction ID so we can take a look at the details?
Its possible that they were above the dust amount, but just barely, that would cause them to be confirmed, even though at 5341 satoshis, they are still essentially worth nothing.

Hello guys and gals.
Few things, not all are questions:
1.  I just got my first trezor a few weeks ago and its amazing.  I got nervous about the shipping but it got to me all the way to the USA in just 5 days.  I'm impressed.
2.  We have a subreddit, you should make an appearance over there also (I know stick is a mod there already).  Maybe just x post this thread?
3.  Are you working with the Electrum and Armory teams to help push them toward Trezor support?  I am eagerly awaiting Electrum 2.0 because Trezor support it coming in that release, but there is no formal release date.
4.  Can you talk a little about the mytrezor site?  One of the big concerns for almost everyone who discusses Trezor is that the site could have problems and people might end up with their coins temporarily stuck, since no other wallets (Electrum, Armory) currently have an official release with Trezor support.  Is there a guide to importing the seed into any other wallets?  Do you know which wallets, specifically, would be best to pursue a manual seed import with?
5.  Semi-related to the mytrezor site question:  Do you have plans to make a decentralized trezor wallet that could eventually replace the mywallet site?  I think many of us who love Trezor, worry about having a single point of failure in the centralized nature of the mywallet site.
6.  Any plans for a ruggedized version?  Something that might meet a spec like IP-67 (IP-67 is protected from dust and immersion in water up to 1 meter)?  I know I would have gladly paid more for an IP67 certified Trezor.

In fairness:  Its true in the US that FDIC covers up to 250k in USD.
1.  Nothing in your safe deposit box is insured.  Bitcoin is much more analogous to gold in your deposit box.
2.  FDIC isn't absolute.   If there was a seriously major electronic theft on a mass scale, the gov doesn't even come close to having the funds to pay everyone back out of reserves.  They would have to issue new debt to pay the FDIC payouts, and that debt would just drive up inflation and be put on the shoulders of our children.

Initial transaction broadcast is nearly instant, but of course the confirmation time is what people talk about when they say "bitcoin isn't fast".
In my own transactions, I seem to run an average of about 5 minutes to the first confirmation and 30-45 to reach 6.
These transactions are labeled "high priority - very soon" when viewed on blockchain.info, but of course if you provide a very low transaction fee to transfer size ratio, then your transactions can sit in limbo for longer.  Also the volume of transactions to your wallet can impact the calculation for what is an ideal transaction fee.

Try this next time someone asks you for money for food:  Offer to walk with them to the nearest food place and buy them a meal.  
I did that when I lived in Chicago and about 7/10 panhandlers would get upset and press HARD for cash instead.  A few got downright mean about it.
The few who accepted my offer, DID genuinely need the meal and were extremely (heart breakingly) appreciative.
Living in the city hardened me a lot.  I regard the average panhandler as a swindler until proven otherwise (based on my own anecdotal experiences, which were in the hundreds of occurrences).

In math, a "curve" is the path of any continuous function.
In this context, a "curve" may be described as "linear" or "exponential", etc...
In mathematics, the graph of a function f is the collection of all ordered pairs (x, f(x)). If the function input x is a scalar, the graph is a two-dimensional graph, and **for a continuous function is a curve**.

Its all a trade between ease of access and security.
Personally:  I keep a normally encrypted QT wallet on an OSX machine.  I'm very careful what I install onto the osx machine.  I have a backup of the wallet.dat file kept with a secure storage company called SpiderOak.
This is less secure than offline generating a paper wallet and moving all the funds to that address, but I am not fully comfortable with the paper wallet process yet and for now this is the level of security that I am personally comfortable with.
I buy bitcoins through a service like Coinbase, and then immediately transfer the coins to my secure wallet(s), so my funds never stay on an exchange.
I follow the same process for LTC.

Few points:
1.  Multisig prevents this if you do not control all the sigs.
2.  There are K&amp;R insurance policies offered by AIG and a bunch of other large firms.
3.  You have to be MEGA wealthy to attract this kind of attention.  I personally know a family whose father was kidnapped for ransom and died during the negotiation time frame.  He was buried alive with a tube to breathe and the tube somehow collapsed and he suffocated.  This family was extremely wealthy and in a public way.  And of all families that hold this status, the odds of something like this happening are extremely small.
No one is coming for your bitcoins, even if you end up with a paltry few million dollars.  The family I knew/know was worth hundreds of millions.

That is a huge cringe.  There is a reason why we make a distinction between "true random number" generators, "psuedo-random number generators", and crypto secure random number generators.

There is even a HUGE warning that accompanies Math.random in the javascript documentation warning against using it for cryptographic  applications.

My understanding is that is correct.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will jump in.
I have moved coins between my coinbase wallet and my vault (mostly just to try it out) and I don't believe those transactions ever hit the blockchain, they were literally instant.
I believe the only transactions that happen on the block chain as a coinbase user are:
1.  Transfer coins from an external wallet to your coinbase wallet.
2.  Transfer coins from your coinbase wallet to an external wallet.
3.  Any/all transfers in or out of the coinbase multi-sig vault.
Its important to note that the Vault and the Multi-Sig Vault are two totally different things.

Not really?
The electrum client comes with an MD5 sum.
ONLY if they had hacked into Electrum's Github account and compromised it with a different MD5 sum (and the corresponding hacked wallet code) could the client be compromised.
It means that clearly Electrum was not careful enough with their Twitter, and that DOES reflect poorly on them as a team, but there is no reason to think that the wallets are compromised.
Look at it this way:  If you were a hacker and had compromised the Electrum client software, what would you do first?  You would start draining wallets...you wouldn't post insane shit on their twitter (which tells the world and Electrum that they have had their twitter hacked)...that will cause Electrum and its users to double down on caution.
If the client was compromised, we would have seen a rash of "fund siphoned out of my Electrum wallet" posts already.
Still though, this is a blemish on that team for allowing their twitter to be hacked.

Wrong Sir, you made the claim, the burden of proving the claim is on you.


That was never the dispute that I believed we were having.  Obviously the credit card processing fee is less than the loss incurred sending the same charge/debt to collections.


Ah, I think this is the crux of our central disagreement.
You are imagining a world where bitcoin is the ONLY method of payment, or where all or nearly all consumers are refusing to use CCs or auto-debit from banks.
As long as those methods exist, shady businesses will always *prefer* to use those methods that allow them to auto bill their customers.
To this end, it is fair to say that the payment method may influence their behavior, but ONLY if their refusal to use a non auto-bill payment method becomes financially not viable...and that is a bit of a non starter, because there is no reasonable expectation of that occurring in our lifetime, or in the forseeable future.
I will concede this point, which I hope satisfies you:  If, somehow, CCs and autobilling to bank accounts were abolished, and the only remaining payment method was bitcoin or cash, then yes, I do concede that the exremely limited payment climate would force a better situation for consumers versus shady businesses.
But the issue we were debating was never one of mutual exclusivity, at least not as I understood it.

This is about shady gym contracts preventing you from issuing a chargeback, and the fact that you signed an agreement without fully understanding it.

I think that if you aren't an early adopter or an enthusiast, its too easy to look at bitcoin forums and see the DAILY threads that say "HELP I lost XXX BTC and I was doing everything right" and get scared away.
As much as I don't like to admit it, I think it still *looks* too dangerous to risk it for many businesses.
Maybe I'm way off base here, but I know that the people I've introduced to it have all said the same basic things:
1.  It looks like its still too easy to get btc stolen.
2.  It seems like there is too much to learn in order to really understand it.
3.  It doesn't seem to solve an actual need that they have.
Please don't mistake me for suggesting that I think these statements are true, but I think they are probably how it often seems.

Yeah, essentially, someone MUST solve this problem or the bookkeeping burden of actually using bitcoin on a daily basis will be too much for the average user (the average person has trouble balancing a check book...in one currency where the value change doesn't matter).   I think that will either stifle adoption, or cause people to simply evade the taxation process, which is bad for other reasons.
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:34:03
I think the Inflation Hoarding Theory is only applicable to societies that have access to only one currency.
For example:  If bitcoin was going up fast, I would still spend it, I would just buy more instantly as soon as I use it.  Problem solved.  If I can buy more of the deflating currency as fast as I can spend that currency, its a non issue.

I'm not a statist, and I posted NO rhetoric.  You are deliberately putting words in my mouth. 
I'm actually very much antistate and you could, if you were so inclined, find posts in my post history where I assert that the state is nothing more than a violence monopoly.
However:   Being anti-state does not make me pro anarcho capitalism.  Its a pipe dream to assume that the free market will solve anything, human greed is simply too strong a force.  Totally open markets have been corrupted by monopolization, corporate espionage, and many other phenomena that are anti consumer.  To listen to this idea that we could solve our problems by turning our basic services into an Ebay market place is assasanine and its not about BITCOIN its about politics.

Your earnest reply has kept me in this, thanks for that.
I'll try to reply to this:


See, the original view was hyperbole, which you have now acknowledged.
But to restate it, in a way that I feel should be open to a more literal and direct critique, hopefully this view can and should stand up to a formal critique:
"Hey OP, if you need another stereotype to parody, I personally feel that the lunatic fringe of the AnCap movement is rife for this kind of lighthearted parody.  While not representing all of the AnCap movement (that is of course, [what "lunatic fringe" means]( this minority is vocal enough that I feel a parody would resonate strongly with people who spend time in enthusiast communities that attract their commentary and vocal outbursts".
Is that better?  My formal position is:
1. The AnCap movement *does* have a lunatic fringe.
2. The people in question are highly vocal on bitcoin related boards.
3. Many but not all of the most vocal people I'm referring to are members of a very large community called F.D.R, led by "SM".
I feel like this is a fair and logically consistent set of statements.

I concur that gold/silver is a good long term store of value.   When you look to sell, look at big dealers like apmex, not a local bank.

I think we are actually *mostly* on the same page.
I just feel that:
1.  The shady behavior will only stop when bitcoin adoption is SO high that it costs a business more money in lost business from not supporting bitcoin, than it does to fleece their current crop of CC and auto-bill customers.
2.  Adoption is not high enough, nor trending strongly enough that this is a forseeable reality.  Yet, anyway.

Hello guys and gals.
Few things, not all are questions:
1. I just got my first trezor a few weeks ago and its amazing. I got nervous about the shipping but it got to me all the way to the USA in just 5 days. I'm impressed.
2. Are you working with the Electrum and Armory teams to help push them toward Trezor support? I am eagerly awaiting Electrum 2.0 because Trezor support it coming in that release, but there is no formal release date.
3. Can you talk a little about the mytrezor site? One of the big concerns for almost everyone who discusses Trezor is that the site could have problems and people might end up with their coins temporarily stuck, since no other wallets (Electrum, Armory) currently have an official release with Trezor support. Is there a guide to importing the seed into any other wallets? Do you know which wallets, specifically, would be best to pursue a manual seed import with?
4. Semi-related to the mytrezor site question: Do you have plans to make a decentralized trezor wallet that could eventually replace the mywallet site? I think many of us who love Trezor, worry about having a single point of failure in the centralized nature of the mywallet site.
5. Any plans for a ruggedized version? Something that might meet a spec like IP-67 (IP-67 is protected from dust and immersion in water up to 1 meter)? I know I would have gladly paid more for an IP67 certified Trezor.

This is the response I was expecting.
You are being deliberately obtuse, and you know it.
It would have been obvious to anyone who made a moment of effort to put my original post into context, that I was being a bit hyperbolic because of the jovial nature of the video, and the lighthearted discussion at hand.
And that is why I reacted the way I did.  Because you strike me as the type of person who (as evidenced by our conversation here) takes delight in being as pedantic and literal possible, even when its obvious that the context of the comment you are objecting to is not one of a serious, literal debate.
I'm going to step away from this conversation now, as this is a bit like playing chess with a bird:  You swoop in, knock over the pieces, shit on the board and strut away claiming victory.
I can tell from your response that you are more than smart enough to make the distinction between a comment posted in jest, and one that needs to be addressed with this level of vigor and literal interpretation.
The fact that you chose to act in this way, shows a lack of character, not a lack of intellect.

The wallet is tied to my name but the only way anyone will get that information is if they pry the information out of Coinbase.  So, the government could request it from Coinbase for it if I was being investigated.  No civilian out in the world can trace that transfer to me via the blockchain.  In theory, a massive hack of coinbase could expose the data...but again, that wallet never stores coins.  The coins get transferred out of that wallet almost instantly, to a Trezor address that is not tied to me at all.
But that is not a concern for me at all.  If the Gov wants the info, they will get it.  The fucking NSA has been essentially snooping the entire internet, and Google is in their back pocket.  Whatever info the gov wants, they will get, one way or another.
So yes, its as close to anonymous as I need it to be.

I checked out your post history.  Its pretty clear that I will not change your mind, as your posts in indicate.
I figure at this rate, its only a few more posts before you tell me to "stop being a bitch" like you did the last guy who criticized Stephan:
As I said:  Stephan has made no clear logical argument here.   He has made a prediction of opinion with no clear facts to support it.  Its akin to saying "the government is going to do X in the future".  He is voicing his opinion about a concern he has.  A concern is not an argument, its a statement of opinion:


And as such, its valid to examine the worldview of someone when they share an opinion.
If I say "My concern is that the state is going to simply start executing people in the street", its valid for you to ask "What are this person's views on the state that formulate this opinion?"
Logical arguments can and should be evaluated on their own merit.
Opinions and "personal concerns" are very much open to a critique of the person who made them.
Keep this in mind:  I bought and read his book "On Truth".  I have listened to many hours of his content.  I credit him with opening my eyes and my mind to some very important ideas on certain topics, and if I ever met him, I would thank him for his contributions to my personal life.  But that doesn't mean that I hold him above personal critique for his views which I believe are damaging, manipulative, and dangerous.

I wouldn't say its strictly necessary, but it helps low memory boxes a bit.  If you know your node is powerful and has tons of ram, its probably something you can omit.  With the swapfile, I think bitcoind will happily run on about 500MB of ram.
Feel free to try it out with and without a swap file and see how your performance runs, that htop tool is really nice to watch the memory usage as the node runs.

I agree.
I think its a combo of anarcho-capalitist insanity and general tin foil hat paranoia.
And probably, there are a lot of people who are buying shit on darknet marketplaces and are super worried about being caught...those people have a very seriously vested interest in extreme privacy.
But even with that, it still doesn't make any sense of why people are literally trying to witchhunt coinbase on a nearly daily basis.
I'm honestly starting to really believe that there may be a small group of people paid to post anti-coinbase sentiment.
We saw what happened in the Uber vs Lyft war...is it really so out there to consider that one of coinbase's competitors may have a dozen or so people on the payroll to drum up anti coinbase fervor?

I took a glance at the very first page of your history and that comment jumped out.
If I have more time, I will take an honest look at a few more pages and give you my impression.
I'm not saying that I am 100% absolutely convinced you are a troll, but that comment was terrible.
If you see a thread you don't like, isn't it enough to just downvote it and walk away?  Is it necessary to jump in and add to the drama?
I usually just shake my head and walk away, but where I draw the line is when an entire subreddit is under constant siege (as this one is).  
When that happens, I usually try to propose a possible solution (as I did the other day).

They are strongly encrypted by Breadwallet using industry standards.
You should expect that if you used a sufficiently strong password, a brute force attack on your encrypted private key file could not succeed before you restored the keys to another wallet and moved the coins elsewhere.
"secure is NOT a sufficiently strong password.

Because a LOT of people are in crypto for fast money/profits and with BTC correcting down for all of 2014, there are a LOT of desperate people out there.
I browsed their forums...do you know how many posts I read that basically  said "If you can't honor $20 paycoins, I can't make rent next month".
Its a scary, scary situation.  I think people got into the red on BTC and panicked, and lept out of the frying pan and straight into the fire that Garza has been stoking under their feet.
The bad news is that a LOT of people are going to lose their shirt on this Paycoin debacle.
The good news is that lessons learned like this tend to stick.  Just like Mt.Gox taught our community not to trust exchanges that don't submit to external audits and show Proof of Reserves....this is going to show the altcoin community that trust must be earned.

Could some of them have been over the daily/weekly limit?
Its certainly possible that there could have been an error/bug that cause a buy which should have been instant, to be treated as non instant, but so far, the only time its happened to me personally is when I went over the daily limit for instant by buying two days in a row (but inside a window of 24 hours).

OP, this is bullshit (the way you are complaining, not saying it didn't happen).
If you were FULLY level 2 verified (you say you are verified, but omit what level) you would have a 1,000 instant buy limit.  The coins hit your wallet before the money has even left your checking account.
I do this on a nearly weekly basis, it takes the coins 8 seconds to hit my wallet and they are instantly transferred out to my Trezor or Electrum wallet (depending on what I plan to do with them).
If you are not LEVEL 2 verified, sometimes transactions can get cancelled.  
This has always been the case with coinbase and if you email their customer support, they have in MANY cases, honored the original buy price, even when it means they lost on the sale.
But of course, that wouldn't be as much fun as stirring up drama on reddit.

Man...you just asked a huge question with a huge answer.
My best suggestion is that you spend some time reading in this subreddit, and also looking up issues like "bitcoin security" and "how to safely store bitcoins".
The truth is that its still an emerging technology and people get hacked and lose coins, even when they are being careful.  Its not widespread, but its happens often enough that is a real concern for most bitcoin adopters.
For example there was a thread just last week where a guy lost multiple BTC because he was trying so hard to be safe, he used TOR and ended up being the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack where they snooped his credentials for his online wallet.
I am NOT trying to scare you away from crypto-currency, but there are real risks because its like cash that you store in your computer.

1.  Buy $120 worth of bitcoin on Coinbase or Circle.  Make sure your account has a strong, unique password AND 2FA enabled.
2.  Use the $120 worth of BTC to buy a Trezor:  
3.  Set up the trezor and once its up and running, buy more bitcoin via the method from Step 1.
4.  Transfer the bitcoins the minute they hit your wallet to the Trezor.
5.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.

Its because Paypal has two levels of verification, I think.  With basic verification, I believe you can take up to $500 a month out of paypal.
If you want to move more money out, they ask for a higher level of verification, and he hit that limit, causing them to ask him for more documents, which he then forged (he purchased forged documents) and submitted to PayPal.
At least that was the story.

Just look at the Trezor site, its $119USD and it does the conversion when you check out.  The price of BTC to USD is not relevant, it is calculated based on the daily rate.

In many of the Coinbase anger threads, people said that it was only a matter of time before Circle ended up having to take the same steps (algorithmic fraud locks, more account freezing) to protect themselves from regulatory annihilation.
I'm honestly surprised that it took this long.
This kind of problem is going to affect all the big vendors of BTC from fiat (via ACH to a checking account or CC) once they get enough volume.
Its a growing pain of the industry, unfortunately.

Josh (if this is indeed you)
This is an unexpected and surprising move.   
You made a huge statement here when you said you would not allow anyone who has invested in Paycoin/Hashpoints to lose their initial investment.  
Specifically:  


Screenshot for posterity:  
One of the reasons i got involved and posted a lot on this topic is because one of my best friends has invested a four figure sum of money into hashing for Hashpoints/paycoin with you.  I tried to convince him otherwise, and he was determined to move ahead.  
I take this a bit personally, as you may understand.  
If you keep your word and at least back your investors so they are not losing their initial investment, i will be happy to admit that i was wrong about you.  
If you leave the people who trusted you hanging with a worthless coin, none of us will ever forget it, or ever let you forget it.  
I sincerely hope you prove me wrong about you.  
EDIT:  Well, the [twitter page that was his proof]( is DELETED, but he did post from his official account on hashtalk saying that this post is legit:  Screenshot:   So now I'm not sure.  I'll just leave my post here and take the heat that I assume is coming my way if we have been had by another troll.

@_date: 2015-01-11 21:07:44


Slight correction:
The reason the price falls is because the RATIO of (new coins being produced + coins being sold) to people who buy bitcoins is rising every month, causing pressure on the supply side to overwhelm the demand, which brings the price down.
 
Saying "less people are buying bitcoin this month than last month" alone is really only looking at one side of the coin, so to speak.

I think its important to note that coinbase is doing what is required of them by KYC/AML, just like a bank would.

Cloud mining blows my mind.  It amazes me that anyone would look at that and say "I want to put my money into this".
Even for the companies that are running honest mining operations, who really have the machines and the hashing power they say they have...even for those companies...for them to make a profit, they have to take a big slice off the top.
And lets remember that mining is an arms race with fierce competition.
The payouts on mining at small scales are so little...how do these customers NOT see that there isn't enough room for the mining company to take their slice AND have enough left for the customer to profit?
I just don't get it.
If I had enough money to create a profitable mining operation, I would do it myself, I wouldn't invest that much into a cloud mining operation where I know I'm losing probably 5-10% off the top.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:42:21

    }else if(nTime &lt; POW_END_TIME - 86400){ // reward is 0 before ending PoW 1 day
        nSubsidy = 49 * COIN;

Its a bash script, so you create a new file and put the contents into the new file, save it as something like "bitcoind_node_creator.sh" and then you run the bash script with a sudo command:
$sudo bash ./bitcoind_node_creator.sh
You should do some research on what the script does before you run it, as you should not trust people on the internet...I could be giving you malicious code.  I give you this warning because its a prudent piece of advice, even though I realize it may seem like a catch 22. 
Once the script has run and your box reboots, you can check on the status of bitcoind by giving it the getinfo command.
Here is the command as I just ran it on my node that runs in the Netherlands:
$bitcoind getinfo
    "version" : 90300,
    "protocolversion" : 70002,
    "walletversion" : 60000,
    "balance" : 0.00000000,
    "blocks" : 337060,
    "timeoffset" : 0,
    "connections" : 89,
    "proxy" : "",
    "difficulty" : 40640955016.57649231,
    "testnet" : false,
    "keypoololdest" : 1417556942,
    "keypoolsize" : 101,
    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
    "relayfee" : 0.00001000,
    "errors" : ""
As you can see, I currently have 89 clients that are receiving the blockchain from my node.
The tools "htop" and "iftop" which my script installs will tell you about the system.  htop tells you about memory and processor load, and iftop shows you all of the active connections so you can monitor them in realtime.
They can be run like this:
Both can be terminated via the standard CTRL+C command to kill the process.

If he got in over his head, THAT was the mistake and he should have been forthcoming about it.
If you violate Rule 1 of investing (Never invest more than you can lose and be ok), lots of reasonable positions start to become impossible to tolerate.
Honestly, it sounds like he put a bunch into the coin at $350 and never even considered the idea that it could drop in value, which would potentially make him the kind of person that spends $50 a week on lottery tickets instead of putting that money into something like a Roth IRA.

I think the speculation in alt coins is tied to the momentum of Bitcoin, being that BTC is the largest cryptocoin in the market.
So, imagine a bunch of buoys on a single rope, with bitcoin at the center.

If changetip (which, by the way, makes hardly any profit) was somehow keeping the tips, yeah I would be a bit disappointed, but it wouldn't really ruin my day.
Tipping is fun.  
If I wanted to send someone money in a serious way (such as helping someone pay a medical bill, or buy something for their child) I would ask them to create a wallet and I would send it directly to them.

I'm NO fan of paypal, but this is an overstatement.
Robbed is if paypal came into your home and STOLE $1200 from under your mattress.
This is more like:  You appointed someone you never met to hold money on your behalf.  When you came to collect, they, having never met you, demanded three forms of ID and you couldn't provide them, so they declined to hand over your money, because they couldn't be sure that you really were the same person who the communicated with initially.
You have a measure of responsibility here:  You had every chance to know their policies and read the TOS, and research them online before allowing them to hold your money.  You didn't do enough research, and it bit you when you tried to cash out a four figure sum of fiat from them.
They ARE assholes, but you are the one who agreed to let a bunch of assholes hold your money in escrow.
There was no robbery.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:41:18


Because they get to define what services they want to provide, and you get to choose if you want to use their service or not.
If they change their TOS on you, and suddenly what they promised is now different, you get to complain.
If you just didn't bother to read the help section on Paypal about withdrawing money, and then find out later that you don't like how they work....you STILL get to complain (no one is stopping you), but at least be honest about the fact that you never once bothered to investigate this until it was a problem, and don't accuse them of theft.
You realize that by providing falsified documents to a financial institution such as Paypal, you have committed a federal felony?
I'm sure as hell not going to report you, but the fact that you thought it was prudent to purchase falsified documents and provide them to Paypal, and then talk about it here shows that you are really not the kind of person who thinks before acting.

I respect you and what you have done for Bitcoin.
I also get where you are coming from here, I personally feel that hitting Garza with the HARD questions at the conference is the best way to get this mess out into the light, since its clear that the conference isn't going to pull his speaking slot away.
I posted these questions in another thread, I would love it if you would consider researching them and maybe asking one or more of them yourself since you will be there, and since people respect you?
Questions to research, and consider asking:
1. Is a coin that is 96-97% premined, where one for-profit entity controls the coins, safe for investors? What is to stop the for-profit entity from manipulating the price of the coin in their own favor?
2. Why have the venture capital funders that provided the $100 Million funding you claim to have, not been identified? Why have the funds never been shown to exist even once? How could other investors or customers know that these funds are real, except taking you at your word?
3. Why does GAW miners not accept Paycoin as a payment method for their own cloud hashing service? They accept BTC, LTC, and DOGE...but not their own coin? Doesn't this refusal to honor the value of their own currency, signal a lack of confidence in GAW's own coin?
4. There has been a lot of controversy online, regarding the alleged promise of Paycoins being purchased back by Paycoin/GAW at $20usd per coin. Many people feel this was a promise made to the Paycoin customers that never materialized. As of this morning, Paycoin is trading at $6 per coin, far from the $20 floor that some feel was promised. Can you please definitively state what promises were made, if any, and if there is still a plan to honor a $20 usd per coin buyback program?

I did eventually dig deep enough to find the actual code where the wordlist is implemented and I saw that all words in the word list are listed in lower case.
So yes, it seems that while in general, mnemonics are of course case sensitive, any standard implementation of BIP-39 would use lower case words from the list.

A few days away and i always remember that in the grand scheme of things, bitcoin has been one hell of an exciting ride, and even if it crashes and burns, it was/is really fun to have been a part of this incredible experiment.

OP:  An addition to your excellent post.
The code that proves your claim about GAW giving its own Primes access to 350% interest is here:
// paycoin: miner's coin stake is rewarded based on coin age spent (coin-days)    
int64 GetProofOfStakeReward(int64 nCoinAge, int primeNodeRate)
    int64 nSubsidy = 0;
    int64 nRewardCoinYear = 0;  // creation amount per coin-year
    if (primeNodeRate == 0)
        nRewardCoinYear = 5 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 10)
        nRewardCoinYear = 10 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 20)
        nRewardCoinYear = 20 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 100)
        nRewardCoinYear = 100 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 350)
        nRewardCoinYear = 350 * CENT;
    nSubsidy = nCoinAge * nRewardCoinYear * 33 / (365 * 33 + 8);
    if (fDebug &amp;&amp; GetBoolArg("-printcreation"))
        printf("GetProofOfStakeReward(): primeNodeRate=%d create=%s nCoinAge=%"PRI64d"
", primeNodeRate, FormatMoney(nSubsidy).c_str(), nCoinAge);
    return nSubsidy;
You can see all instances of this method here:
And all instances of the use of primeNodeRate here:

I believe that a voluntary society of educated, intelligent people who all agree to a full commitment of non violence is the ideal human society.  If such a society existed, the "state" would not even be necessary, and the type of societal framework that you would have would not even really look like a "government", relative to what we have now.
But I just don't think we are ready yet, as a species.
I think we need to have maybe 5-10 generations where there is no religion, and no violence in the home, with a good education system and then *maybe* that group of people would have a good chance to form the kind of peaceful, voluntary society that we both would like to see.

Regarding   NXT has been proven to be a true proof of stake coin, so even though it is technically 100% premined, it doesn't suffer from the danger of the devs cashing out and pump-n-dumping the coin.
Paycoin has NOT been shown to be a true proof of stake, and my understanding is that the creators could dump that 97% at any moment.
That is a pretty big difference, and its one reason why NXT isn't considered a scam, then MOST pre-mined coins ARE considered scams.

Its simply not even realistic to try and hit ROI these days unless you make mining a full time business, with all of the writeoffs and tax incentives that you get as a business.
An enthusiast, mining at home stands to NEVER break ROI under any circumstances unless they are not paying for power, and even then, you can still fail to make ROI, much less a profit.
Cloud mining is a scam, pure and simple.  
That really doesn't leave any options for the average person in mining, except to lose money.
Every bit of solid advice at BCT or will tell you that you are better off just buying bitcoin, and its like that for a reason.

2.  Why have the venture capital funders that provided the $100 Million funding you claim to have, not been identified?  Why have the funds never been shown to exist even once?  How could other investors or customers know that these funds are real, except taking you at your word?
3.  Why does GAW miners not accept Paycoin as a payment method for their own cloud hashing service?  They accept BTC, LTC, and DOGE...but not their own coin?  Doesn't this refusal to honor the value of their own currency, signal a lack of confidence in GAW's own coin?

The reboot comes from the fact that bitcoind is never manually started and  it gets started on boot.  This was brought up the last time I posted this script and the reboot is not harmful in any way, but it *could* be eliminated if you so choose.

Actually this is widely misunderstood.
The amount of currency in circulation in USD is about 1.2 Trillion and it stays about the same most of the time.
What the federal reserve does, that often gets called "printing money" is a combination of creating new debt out of thin air, and fractional reserve lending, where they can lend one actual dollar about 100 separate times, as if its 100 dollars.
Those actions are why we say the US is "printing money", it not ACTUAL printing of paper currency in circulation.

Coinbase wouldn't touch paycoin with a 10 meter stick.
My guess is that he needs an exchange to continue this scam or it will fold.
He said he has 100M of funding that will guarantee a $20usd per paycoin buyback, but even though the initial volume would only have cost a fraction of that, he still would not honor $20 a coin.
That means the 100M is vapor, it never existed, and he is almost certainly using all the fiat/BTC that people use to buy paycoin, to run his company.
He needs an exchange to manipulate or the people fleeing the coin will expose the fact that he cannot actually afford to cash out his customers.
The exchange is what transitions paycoin from a short con to a long con.

Yes.  
Your wallet is a collection of addresses (just like a real wallet can hold many bills of varying denominations).  Both receiver addresses and CHANGE addresses (which you should go read about).
When you send BTC from your wallet to another wallet, what actually happens is kinda like handing a cashier a $20 bill, for a $2 sale.  You pay the whole $20, and then $18 in returned to you in change.
That is what happens from your wallet.  Lets say that your wallet has 10btc.  If you send 1 BTC to someone, and you have 10 BTC at that address, 9 BTC gets sent back to a change address that your wallet supplies for the transaction.  
I know it sounds strange, but its all handled by the wallet automatically.
Also:  In an HD wallet like Electrum, its a best practice to not re-use receiver addresses.  If I send funds to my electrum or Trezor wallet multiple times, I will use a different receiver address each time.
Welcome to bitcoin.
Here is a tiny bit of BTC that you can use to tip others with, or you can take it out of Changetip and send it to your wallet at one of your receiver addresses:

The pin protects the coins, because the Trezor has an increasing timeout on successive pin attempts that persists even across power loss.  








The passphrase is a layer on TOP of the existing security, that adds a layer of encryption on top of what is already there, to prevent against extremely unlikely attacks like someone using an electron microscope to peek into the Trezor:
Using passphrase encrypted seeds

I do NOT use a passphrase on my Trezor because I believe the risk of typing it into my computer is much higher than someone stealing my Trezor and having the resources and skill to use electron microscopy to try and scan the keys.

Cloud mining is, in its very conception, a losing proposition for the customer.
Think of it in its basic form:  You are a company with a massive bank of miners that you bought at some point.  You want to make the most money you can from these miners.  You can either mine bitcoin directly, or you can rent these miners to people who will pay you a rental fee, but they keep the bitcoins mined.
If, regardless of the numbers, you come to the conclusion that its more profitable to rent out the miners to people, it essentially proves to the customer that whatever share of mining power they buy, they are paying MORE than if they simply mined themselves.
Now...if mining was profitable in general for small operations then you might make the argument that its worth it to rent cloud mining power to save yourself the hassle and time it would take to set up your own mining rig.
But since mining at home or for small operations is NOT profitable...it should be patently obvious to anyone who does even 1 hour of internet research on this topic that cloud mining is a fool's errand for the customer.
How this is not simply obvious to nearly everyone is as scary as it is depressing.

Paypal has my CC for purchases (I buy stuff on Ebay and its pretty much the only way without a MEGA hassle) but NOT my bank info.  If they jerk me around I can issue a chargeback and they will have to eat it, because their polices are pretty much always anti seller.
There was a time, long ago when they had my bank acct info, but when I saw the fees the would take, even to reciceve $100 for an item I sold on Ebay, I was like "never again".
I'm currently waiting on some other marketplace to open up where I can sell goods and get paid in either bitcoin, or via square or applepay or something, anything but Paypal.
Fuck paypal.

Its hard to say but yeah...one would assume that someone who intended to abscond with the funds would run it through a tumbler or 20 before trying to go spend the funds anywhere?
This is all speculation of course, but seeing ALL the known missing funds go to one wallet and just sit there is rather surprising.

I only pointed that out because NONE of us are anonymous even on reddit.
Like I said, I'm not interested in reporting you and I do understand your frustration with Paypal.  I only had an issue with the fact that you didn't accept part of the responsibility, and then instead of saying "Yeah, it was dumb of me to not look into their withdraw limits before trying to withdraw a large amount" you got defensive.
I wish you all the best, hopefully in a year or two, we will have options that will make it ever easier to set Paypal aside and never use them again.

I agree with the op on one big point:  Currency that is not secured by "proof of violence" has potential to change the world.  
I think the point gets lost in his rant, and people are not ready for a society without a state.  Im sure the ancaps will downvote me for saying that, but we are one grid failure from fucking **eating each other**.  We are apes with atomic weapons.  
But i do hope we last long enough to get to the point where a state is considered usess and dangerous.  
Im still waiting for us to shrug off the chains of organized religion.

Tip 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-12 00:07:34
So, that IS true, but I think the sheer amount of coins being mined right now is something that should get mentioned in this discussion.  Its not like some other industries like Gold, where they stabilize the price by slowing the mining when the price starts to fall...Bitcoin is mined at a deterministic rate and presumably always will be.
Right now, the mining volume, in conjunction with the depressed value means that miners are dumping coins at a very high rate.   While its absolutely true that these are "sells" and we can talk about all "sells vs buys" in a generic way, its worth mentioning the mining volume because if we didn't mention it, it would not paint a full picture of WHY the sell volume is as high as it is.
Only when the block rewards drop to near zero, and miners make their profit on transaction fees alone, will we really be able to take miners out of that equation.
I'm not disagreeing with you, but I do think that looking as sells in conjunction with the amount of new coins mined every day is probably ideal.

I posted these in another thread:
Questions to research, and consider asking:
1. Is a coin that is 96-97% premined, where one for-profit entity controls the coins, safe for investors? What is to stop the for-profit entity from manipulating the price of the coin in their own favor?  NXT was a 100% premined coin but it is true proof of stake and the original creators don't own the coins anymore....with Paycoin, the original creator still appears to have a liquid 97% of all Paycoin at his disposal.
2. Why have the venture capital funders that provided the $100 Million funding you claim to have, not been identified? Why have the funds never been shown to exist even once? How could other investors or customers know that these funds are real, except taking you at your word?
3. Why does GAW miners not accept Paycoin as a payment method for their own cloud hashing service? They accept BTC, LTC, and DOGE...but not their own coin? Doesn't this refusal to honor the value of their own currency, signal a lack of confidence in GAW's own coin?
4. There has been a lot of controversy online, regarding the alleged promise of Paycoins being purchased back by Paycoin/GAW at $20usd per coin. Many people feel this was a promise made to the Paycoin customers that never materialized. As of this morning, Paycoin is trading at $6 per coin, far from the $20 floor that some feel was promised. Can you please definitively state what promises were made, if any, and if there is still a plan to honor a $20 usd per coin buyback program?
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:57:57

Its not necessary.  You could probably set "swappiness = 0" and forget about swap if you have enough ram.
I kept that to protect against this being run on systems that actually need to have swap configured.
That can be omitted if you are running on a system you know doesn't need swap space.
Lots of cheap cloud nodes are tiny on ram, so I wanted this to run even on a box with low ram and no swap configured.

I cannot imagine that is good for the equipment.  It would be a lot safer to run the miners in a separate room and vent the heat to the barrel storage via negative pressure.
I say this because if you ever tour a whiskey distillery (barrel aging process is similar), there is something called the "angels share" which is the whiskey that seeps/evaporates out of the barrels and ends up soaking into the bricks of the building.  It seems like this would eventually have an effect on the miners also, but maybe they would be obsolete before that happens?
Neat idea at any rate.
Note:  The whiskey that ends up in the barrel and can never be reclaimed is called "The Devil's Cut".  I just thought those two terms were cool.

No. 
They have clarified:  Their report given to users which shows xfers as "sales" is only to give you a "bought at" and "moved at" values so you can calculate a cost basis.
The IRS doesn't get that report, they see transfers only.

I still haven't made a dime because I haven't cashed out.
Hopefully I'll be fine, I read the IRS guidelines and it appeared to me that as long as I wasn't hiding income/profit, I had nothing to report.

I sold a few btc to a friend at the same price I bought it for, which resulted in zero gain, so zero taxable income if I understand the tax law correctly.

Its the typical panic sell.  This happens over and over and over as people get into BTC, ride their first bull run, and then lose their minds when the price dips.
I have survived the previous dips, and I will survive this too!

Thanks, I stand corrected, the dip I was looking at (my chart fooled me) was this:
View Sep 12, from 5am to Noon.  So it was not a "few hours" I guess.  Thanks.

Both the diaz brothers are scrappers.  They want to stand in the pocket and hit you until you are punch drunk, then its usually a submission or tko via strikes.  Neither of them cultivate knockout power.  They both throw very accurate combinations and never let you breathe.  
Keep in mind that these guys do triathlons for fun like its nothing.  They have/had the best gas tanks in the sport.  
Masvidal is a very interesting fight for nate.   I am thrilled its happening.

I concur.
I still haven't sold/converted a single satoshi, I have only ever bought and held.  I think I made one purchase for something small a while ago, it was maybe $10-$15.
I bought in at $300, only what I could afford to set on fire.  Yes I am up a lot now by % return, but even if it goes to zero, it won't be something I have to feel super bad about.  It was a fun risk to take.
I wish more people could see it like this, it would lead to so much more stability and less FUD, but that is just IMVHO.

It sure has its awesome moments.  This has been one of them.
I remember back when Gox collapsed and literally everyone ran around like their heads were on fire.
Now we dip from 4500 to 4000 in a few hours* and most of us are sleeping through it.
I decided long ago that I was riding this train to the end.  That means bitcoin folds and lose my investment (which is ok), or it soars and I retire.
I'm not interested in anything between those two outcomes.
EDIT:  About the dip in a few hours, it was clarified that the dip was a bit less steep.  It was like 4300 to 4000 over 5-6 hours, depending on what exchange you were tracking.

Actually you can disable downvoting and only allow upvoting.
Other subs have done it.

I still would not trust a computer with TeamViewer on it to access coins, exchanges, coinbase/circle, or run wallet software.

If anything it may harm bitcoin.  I say that because once the ransoms start going out to people "pay X in BTC to this address to make this identity theft stop" that is all the mainstream media will talk about.

I actually forgot they were a good guy greg and reverted to fully open.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:44:43
Not if they cloned it from before Trezor changed their license.  Once you publish open source, there are no "takebacks".
~~The current/newer versions, yes would be a violation.~~
Correction:  They went to MS license and then reverted back to fully open in a few days.  So I think the only versions of the software which would be not open would be the few which were published under the MS license.

Just cheaper.  No added features, no extra security...just a port and a clone of hardware, sold at rock bottom because you people didn't have to put in hardly any work to build what you are now selling.
It makes "sense" if all I care about is price, but that is FAR from all that I care about.
Trezor made a mistake making their product fully open source.  If I had been a part of their team, I would have urged them to use a license that restricts commercial use (but still allows personal use, public code inspection + contribution of fixes and improvements).
Your product only exists legally because the Trezor team underestimated the speed at which China can copycat technology.  I've been in the industry a long time, and I've trained teams in China, and I know all too well how good they are at the copycat game.
I hope your company goes down in flames.  Just because you can make your product and sell it legally, doesn't mean what you are doing is right.

As a guy who works with AWS on a daily basis, doing fairly complex network deployments on that platform...you hit the nail on the head.
I have a strong love/hate relationship with that platform.  If they would just add a fucking console....
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:15:10
**I recently tested my passwords (complex 25+ character passwords) using the BitcoinQT debug console:**


That command will enter the passphrase to the wallet and store it for 1 second as active.  It will report to you, if you used the correct vs incorrect passphrase.
You can use that command to verify a passphrase before you move money into that wallet, but I'm not sure how it works with double encryption.
**OP:  How do you test both passwords in the case of double encryption?**

Imagine the wallet is a lockbox.  The key is the only key that will open the box.
If you had a locksmith make you a box like this, you would be trusting that he never made a copy of the key for nefarious purposes.
This is *identical* to paper wallet generation.  If you use software or a service to generate both a public address and the corresponding main key, then you are trusting that service.
This video on public key encryption is pretty heavily related to the crypto at play in your wallet address + key relationship.  
However, a digital wallet has a list of addresses and keys for those addresses.  That list is used to receive change (read up on change addresses).  Essentially, when a client like bitcoinQT sends money, it sends essentially the entire wallet amount out, and the (total amount - what you send to an external address) is what gets sent back to a change address that was supplied by bitcoinQT from your wallet's pool of addresses.
So, what you are asking about is the FIRST key for a new wallet.  Once a wallet has sent money, it has to then store the change addresses and the corresponding keys for those addresses forever, or the change can be lost. 
Back to wallets and keys:
That is why the paper wallet ideal creation method is:
Verified clean/trusted *temporary* install of linux (debian is common) running offline from a disk/usbdrive.
Offline code generator from a trusted source.
Plus then you have to clean up your tracks by shutting down the machine which will wipe the memory, and verifying that your printer did not store the job in any way that can be retrieved if you put it back on the network.
I went through this process recently and it wasn't nearly as bad as you would think.

They have stated this in the past, that only 10% of their funds are ever in hot wallets and the rest are in cold wallets under physical security.
Its possible that is part of the reason, but they still need to strive to reduce these downtimes.
I'm a happy coinbase user who has defended them a lot in the past, but I have to admit that they do appear to be struggling with scaling dynamically as their load changes.
That is a solveable problem, but its not as easy as it sounds.  Depending on their platform (AWS, Rackspace, etc...) there could be infrastructure issues that they have to sort out.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:47:06
It would be better for you to buy a $15 usb miner to just learn the technology, then take the other $180 you were going to spend on a miner, and just set it on fire.
It would get you to the exact same point as buying a $200 mining rig.
I am really dead serious, except you should just buy BTC with the remaining $180.

As a guy who works daily in AWS, Azure, Google compute cloud, etc....  what you said is spot on.
It is not as easy as "slap a loadbalancer on it" or "spin up more containers".  Secure, scalable architectures require excellent design and excellent deployment and configuration.
