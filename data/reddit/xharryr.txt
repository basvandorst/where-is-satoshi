Does this mean the retards screaming exit scam can shut the fuck up now?
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:01:54
Is this US only?
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:44:40
They're a business based in the US and regulated by US authorities.. I doubt they would be 'off the map' so that they could run off with funds.. 
If they were based in a less strict country I could totally see why people would be concerned but it's the US..

No, he's just salty
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:27:05
No, you can use it from countries around the world, I think he just meant it's one of the better options for US people, other countries have a lot more chocie

the whole jackpot was paid for by the players, so even if they dont pay it out they are still stealing customer money thats designated for something else. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:29:41
Sure it is, he broke those terms and conditions and as a private company they can do what they want :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:02:33
He's free to use ANY other payment processor he likes, If it was censorship he wouldnt be able to use any, 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:16:20
Oh, news to me haha.
I think quadriga in an exchange you can use, I'm not Canadian so I could be wrong
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:55:51

But your money is insured, so if they do 'lose' it you don't lose out.

It literally never takes more than a day. .  5 days is always a 'worst case scenario.. '
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:08:53
Its literally so they can track your spending to come up with spending habits and how much you spent at x and y then you see it to see if you want to budget it or not. . .
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:42:16
Something tells me that bit is absolute nonsense.
@_date: 2018-10-29 01:21:18
Then move to a different bank, These questions dont come up with my bank, they collate all my information into where i spend etc automatically anyway, in the grand scheme of things they really dont care why you are spending your money. (assuming its not for illegal purposes obviously. )
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:43:32
It's fairly instant.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:08:32

@_date: 2017-08-11 14:31:04
Create a brand new address with no tx's -&gt; filter ransom in smaller amounts to multiple addresses -&gt; take smaller amounts to exchanges/shapeshift.io etc and convert to another coin -&gt; sell other coin on supported exchanges.

You still pay US taxes for aslong as you have citizenship.

Not sure what the fuss is, it's much easier to just sell and get paid via bank transfer.

yup, you're sour ;)
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:55:27
Some banks in the UK don't allow you to deposit cash into accounts that aren't yours now anyway. So online transfer would be the way to go.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:23:22
ATM fees are non-existent in Europe, 99.9999% of banks will let you use their ATMs for free.

I don't give my cards to the waiter when i pay in a restaurant.. they take the payment at the table.
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:05:40
None of the big banks in the UK charge you to withdraw cash.
@_date: 2019-04-16 16:14:56
It's only forbidden in the US, they still have backwards ass laws for some reason :/
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:08:29
I think they refer to wire transfers as bank transfers, wire transfers are like $30 a time i think
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:48:53
Fees aren't that much anymore though?
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:53:10
Idk, I'm in the UK too, I was just saying what I thought the answer to your question is :P
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:58:39
They serve customers worldwide. IRS can't touch me in the UK
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:56:28
Yup, luckily ATM our government is full of morons who don't understand technology (basic computers let alone bitcoin lmao) so we are safe for now.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:05:07
using bitcoin to gamble isnt money laundering though, especially when gambling is legal anyway
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:42:07
We have a similar authority, but afaik they don't seem to care about buying BTC &amp; it isn't taxable we do have some banks that make a fuss and can close accounts however, same as some you have other there ;)

Probs the lack of them
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:01:36
Yup, I'm also inclined to think it's a lil sketchy with he fact that the address they use doesn't exist etc however I haven't had any issues with them and they've responded to any emails I've sent fairly quickly so from my point of view they are sketchy but they won't take your money.
 Just take usual precautions when depositing - smaller more frequent amounts rather than one big amount and to make sure to only keep a small amount of funds in the accounts at one time.
