Yeah people tend to dislike being robbed. Someone allegedly steals from you incompetent idiots and you crooks somehow think that gives you the right to rob others.
Yeah, you're a total piece of crap. You're no better than Mark Karpeles and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if you bitfinex fegs end up in jail just like Mark.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:21:24
The names of all bitfinex directors are public knowledge. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:26:22
Any such settlement "agreement" would be worthless in court. You can't just steal 36% of someone's property, threaten to steal the rest if they complain and expect it to hold up in court. Agreements made under duress are non-binding.

We don't know any specifics because although the zanescammer talks a lot he says nothing. No mention of any specific law enforcement fegs, no mention of specific numbers, no list of bitfinex asshat assets, nothing. Everything is glossed over with generalities by the zanetackett criminal.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:33:38
Lying and stealing tend to go hand in hand. Now they have to lie some moar to cover for their stealing from accounts that were never hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:54:59
Yeah it's hilarious. zanescammer talks a lot, but never says a damn thing. Simple questions like, which law enforcement agencies are investigating are met with "all of them". WTF does that mean? It's a simple question and surely can't be a secret...but somehow it is a secret.
zane deserves praise like Mark Karpeles deserves praise for getting out on bail.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:50:07
...allegedly their bungling cost $70m. Then they used that as justification to rob those that weren't robbed during the hack. Now the same provably incompetent crooks want to continue operations like nothing happened.
If you get a chance to get your funds out, do so. Then sue these scammers into oblivion.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:00:43
The zanescammer would have us believe that all the limits, safeguards, and alarms were disabled by the alleged attacker. Obviously if the zanescammer is NOT lying(unlikely) then bitfinex workers are stupid as rocks and grotesquely incompetent. Nobody should be pleased that such a poorly run exchange could potentially return to operation...at least until the next alleged theft.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:51:11
...except in a bankruptcy the same crooks wouldn't be allowed to continue operating.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:56:38
I think all the bitfinex ahole directors eventually end up wearing locking bracelets. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:03:57
Of course he is. Zane is a director in a criminal institution. He talks constantly and says precisely nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:53:18
Yes, get a bunch of feg lieyers involved and see who ends up with 80% of everything left at finex. Lieyers will just turn it into a 5yr legal battle, the legal fees will eat nearly everything, and you'll get a check worth 5 cents on the dollar...when you retire.
An army of lieyers will help nobody save the army of lieyers.

Who cares how it happened? Who cares if it happens again? Bitfinex will just rob their own customers again to cover for their own incompetence.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:56:27
They have YOUR funds to steal and re-capitalize themselves with, why would they use their own money to cover for their gross incompetence?
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:35:37
You don't. You don't know much of anything...just take zanescammer's word for it. He and his fellow criminals are robbing you as fairly as possible.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:15:12
Kind of a big difference. I hope these are sockpuppet accounts created by the criminals that run bitfinex. I'd like to think people aren't so stupid that they'd still trade there after being robbed by zanetackett and his criminal buddies.
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:11:09
Lieyers won't fix this, they'll just steal the lions share of what's left for themselves and hand you whatever table scraps they feel like graciously allowing you to have...5 years from now.
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:08:55
lol Major banks lose &amp; steal trillions. Yeah let's all emulate banks.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:39:23
I predict that this will cost scamfinex directors a great deal over time. Even if they don't wind up in prison, they've shown complete disregard for transparency and ethics. If I'm given the chance I'll withdraw anything that hasn't been stolen yet and never get near their corrupt exchange again.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:29:48
"What law enforcement?"
zanetackett scammer told me that was a secret. Basically any information you want as a lowly customer is off limits. You'll be robbed because zanetackett and his fellow scammers need bigger boats. That is all.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:28:40
bitfinex is NOT going to be 100% transparent. The zanescammer set the tone early on by continually referring to stolen funds as "customer losses". It should come as no surprise when bitfinex crooks continue to provide zero transparency.
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:40:02
The comment at blog.bitfinex.com talks about losses shared amongst bitcoin balances and active loans to BTCUSD positions. Never know when you're dealing with sleazy people though. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:35:36
It's also illegal, but zanetackett and his merry band of crooks don't care about such petty details.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:18:06
Zane isn't transparent about anything other than the amount non-transparent yammering he's doing. He posts constantly, but says nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:08:06
Idiots thanking bitfinex for stealing from them. Unreal.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:58:38
Good god you guys are stupid if you use bitfinex ever again. Take whatever zanetackett and his criminal colleagues don't steal and RUN AWAY. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:10:57
Except that's NOT what happened. My accounts were unaffected by the allegedly hacker as I had ZERO bitcoin on bitfinex. The thieves that stole from my account are all employed by bitfinex.
