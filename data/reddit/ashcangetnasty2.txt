There’s an argument to be made that the correction for the peak hasn’t completed, which is why you see gradual decline back to 3500 since peak. It hasn’t stopped dropping yet. A 1 year chart is arbitrary at this point. Wait until you have a steady value, then talk to me about overall gains.

It’s worth pointing out that, logically, Dimon can be a shitbag AND be correct about btc.

Political forces (ie reality) vs. subjective emotional forces from its fanbase. Cryptocurrency might be the future, but bitcoin is a joke. Bitcoin has no value other than what people FEEL like paying for it. For that reason, no serious investor would touch it with a ten foot stick.

Conveniently leaves out rampant speculation and violent swings in volatility lol.

Your employees guna be pissed when their paychecks are cut in half overnight based on speculation. If I worked for you I’d quit and then sue your ass (for real money).

I guarantee my fiat savings (and the investments I have using fiat savings) show better performance than any post-crash btc portfolio by a series of magnitude. 
Literally, if any real currency went through the swings bitcoin has in a similar amount of time, it would rightly be considered a dead currency. 
Crypto might have a future. But btc is a miserable failure.

I’ll take mild inflation over rampant volatility every day of the week.
