Friend bought a car on the CC since she didn't have her wiring instructions.  She paid it off 2 hours later, because she's not insane.

I know this sort of thing is inevitable, but never like seeing it.  I'm a finra registered representative, and the reporting requirements irk me.  I hate having my employer being required to see my financials.  Since btc is a commodity it doesn't need to be reported yet,  although I'm sure it's coming soon for altcoin since the sec likes to treat them as shares, especially on an initial offering.  By that same logic, Bitcoin will surely at some point be scrutinized in the same way, and if it ever happens I'll just quit my job.
What's fucked up is that I don't give give financial advice in my job, but because I have the same license, I'm treated the same way as someone who is.

No, shorting is not that.  Shorting is selling an investment you have \*borrowed\*.
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:12:28
That's not how any of this works.

I think you mean all that to avoid taxation.

Yeah, even at the support agent level. Almost every company I've ever worked for has had a policy of leaving computers turned on24/7, even on weekends.  They worry about not being able to update machines that are turned off.
Wake on lan is something that is too complicated on the enterprise level apparently.
There's this guy who has been on FMLA for months.  We got yelled at for turning good computer off!

Call me crazy, (I am definitely uninformed on the topic) but could it be said that this is an example of the old cliche about a company hiring hackers as a means of fighting fire with fire?

Not surprised.  While your actions are of course not nefarious as described, a large deposit/withdrawal in a short period of time would be flagged.

Is this true just to credit cards, or does a WF customer still have the ability to purchase/sell bitcoin into their deposit accounts?  
I can understand the decision to ban the purchase of crypto using a credit card...you can't buy other investments on credit.  Bitcoin is technically a commodity, sure, but the arguments of "this bank is telling me what I can spend my money on" is a little off-base if it pertains to purchases on a credit card.  
\*If they are legitimately blocking purchases from a deposit account, I completely agree with the ire, however, I am a little suspicious that they are blocking them from deposit accounts.\*
\ A purchase with a credit is using the banks money, not yours.  
\ Credit card companies restrict all kinds of purchases for a variety of reasons.  In fact, a lot of major banks have been banning crypto purchases on credit for a long time now.
\ Credit card interest rates are really high.  Just because you can have a high balance and afford the monthly payment, doesn't mean you should be.  Banks and credit card companies nowadays display all kinds of data about how the interest rate works.  Why would you WANT to pay that interest?  Never carry a balance!
\ Anyone buying crypto or any other investment on any form of credit is being retarded.  You wouldn't be dumb enough to borrow money from a loan shark to use on a horse race would you?  The first rule of investing/gambling is to never spend money you can't afford to lose. When you buy crypto on credit, you know what you are doing...you are gambling that it will rise so you can sell at a profit.  But if it doesn't?  Have fun paying your credit card bill that you obviously can't afford.  If you could, you wouldn't be buying crypto with credit.

I believe you are mistaken.

Nah, all that would have to be done is to update the protocol.

I'm a complete noob on the subject, but there's no way in hell that I would use that atm.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:41:38
It seems that most people in my city care more about how many atm's their bank has than anything else.
Personally I don't really have a need for cash anymore so I don't understand it.
@_date: 2019-08-18 00:07:24
Not very bright, are you?

I understand the appeal of not wanting to comply with KYC.  But why the obsession of it with BTC?
BTC was never private.  It was never like cash.  Just because you can but it with cash, doesn't mean it's private.  The ledger, which is what makes BTC great, precludes true anonymity.
Which do you want?  BTC to be more adopted, or true anonymity?  You can't have both.
There are options for true anonymity.  BTC isn't it.

Yeah, everytime I see someone posting something about the topic it's clearly someone who has yet to spend the 5 minutes googling to find out how much of an ordeal it is to run an atm.
When I did that, my first thought was, "wow, I'm surprised there are as many as these things as they are."
It's a pretty big ordeal.  I'm glad they exist, it's one of many factors that are reinforcing legitimacy of the platform to the average joe.

Shouldn't this be titled, "How to get yourself robbed at gunpoint"?

Why in the world would you carry a wallet anywhere?
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:03:22
Multiple wallets?  You get your house broken into and beat with a wrench, give them the info for a wallet with not too much in it...
Kinda like having multiple safes.  Dude holds you at gunpoint demanding to be taken to the safe, you take him to the safe with a grand in cash and some id's, but your real safe is in another room.

What Timhos (and others) are talking about, is the importance of backing up the seed phrase somewhere safe, on a medium that has longevity such as being stamped into steel.

Because anyone with a wrench, hammer, fork, staple gun, or a pencil and some imagination can force you to unlock it.

I don't understand.  Paypal is the LAST place I can think of to hold funds.  Why would you want to do that?
