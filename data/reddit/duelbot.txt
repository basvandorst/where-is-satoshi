Just an interesting data point about  currently an order of $15000 on Mt. Gox (info via [bitcoinity.org/markets]( will move the price to $135.66 from $135.00, a whopping 0.4%.

Security is very difficult to audit on said devices - how do you know what code you're really running?  Also, see [recent hacks]( of blockchain.info android app (not really relevant after update, but just shows that security holes are very possible with android apps).

No closeups of the ASIC itself?  Would also love to see if they fixed the problem with the BGA vias not being filled, or using offset pads...
Also, why the horrible bypass cap placement?  No caps on backside under ASICs?

Well, that is up to them, but buying or selling the CFD doesn't create any transaction other than in a ledger owned by plus500...

From the article: Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending bitcoins; it has an "algorithm" which through some convoluted mechanism allows bitcoins to be "mined".
Love the mocking tone and the "quotes".

Evidence?  Seems like it's just a catchy title for a spam article about coinbase...

People will organically adopt what is memorable and meaningful, no need to force things.  Do your part by simply calling things by whatever name gets the point across to both you and the person you're talking to.  This is how languages develop.
By the way:
* deci = tenth = 0.1
* centi = hundreth = 0.01
* milli = thousandth = 0.001
* micro = millionth = 0.000001
* nano = billionth = 0.000000001 
edit: formatting

Without access to Satoshi's original private communications with his friends / accomplices, I would say, probably.  The idea was likely discussed for a long time without a specific name.  People don't come up with a word then build a concept around it, rather ideas are formed and later given names.  I would guess that, not having a name, one of the early developers probably started calling it a money bit, another bitcash, and someone else called it bitcoin.  One or two members picked up bitcoin, it seemed to fit, and then that's what everyone used.  There were probably holdouts who introduced other new users to moneybits or whatever, but most were introduced to bitcoins, and they introduced others to bitcoins, and the idea was named.

Unfortunately, the first half of the transaction is a bit problematic - it is difficult to exchange most fiat currencies for BTC "instantly".  No one will allow you to buy BTC on your credit card or with paypal, because those charges can easily be reversed, while the BTC transaction can't be.  On the other hand, if the customer already has BTC in their possession a merchant can accept BTC through bitpay.com and have those bitcoins immediately turned into dollars for whatever the market rate is.

This particular trade is for buying something called a CFD (contract for difference).  When you buy the CFD, you're not actually buying the bitcoins themselves, but placing a bet that the price will rise or fall.  All you get is a contract saying that they'll pay you in dollars the difference between the price of bitcoins on some future date and the price of bitcoins right now (or, if things go poorly, you might be obligated to pay them money if the price of bitcoins declines).  No bitcoins ever change hands.  For an explanation of CFD's and margin, see [this article]( on wikipedia.
