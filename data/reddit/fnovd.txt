Honestly, the problem is our stupidly low interest rates. The Fed is raising it bit by bit but you still get garbage returns in a savings account. Inflation might not feel great but deflation is worse: it de-incentivizes consumption (why spend cash now when all consumer prices are going down?) and leads to serious economic issues. There’s a lot of voodoo from the Fed, but inflation is normal and healthy.

3% a day for 5 years is ~26787679052261220000000000%. So, if today your BTC is worth 15,000 USD, in 5 years it would be worth as many USD as there are stars in the universe.

But eventually the money runs out and you have to go home. The house always wins.

Sorry but you are no longer the driving force behind BTC. The driving force is now grandma and grandpa who are buying BTC for ~~15k~~ ~~16k~~ ~~17k~~ **18k** because graphs can only move in one direction.
When BTC drops from 20k to 10k, your profit will go from 400% to 100%. But for grandma and grandpa, their profit is going from ~30% to **-30%**. They will sell. They don't know what HODL means.
You are not the driver. It's wallstreet, grandma, and grandpa.

And whose money, exactly, do you think those algos are trying to take? Use your brain, ffs

If you **don't** think this is the case, I don't think there is anything of value you *can* tell me.

You're only looking at the upside.
Let's say you bought in  with $100. If it drops to 500, you lose 50%
If they buy  with $100 and it drops to 500, they lose almost **97%**.

You only get +100% because you bought low. People buying in now obviously can't do that. If you bought in at $100, losing 50% of your initial investment means losing $50. The people buying in at 17k have a fundamentally different calculus, and **they** are the market drivers now.
