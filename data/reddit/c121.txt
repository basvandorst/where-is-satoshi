Wow thanks, after not logging in for a while, this is a great thing to be greeted by.

Right, they'd have to make a much larger percentage of hashes valid. If every single hash was valid, you would need 57 people mining for the ten minutes per hash thing to make sense. I know this isn't the right number to use for this, but let's say all 1721 bitcoin nodes connected right now were people mining bitcoin by hand. This would make only 3.3% of hand-calculated hashes valid (and they'd take 9.4 hours each to do). However, this is 85.87E15 times easier than the current difficulty.

Thanks, did you mine that by hand?
At the lowest possible difficulty, it would take  4610444.13 years to find a block by hand. I'd say doing a hash or two during is reasonable, though.

One character per 32-bit word. Much less ink that way.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:31:01
Let's say that the algorithm can be cracked with just two hashes (not one, this guy likes tan, but didn't realize ecru appeals to him more)
That drops this down to just 18 hours. That's actually reasonable.

Whoops, I meant how much you spend over how much you earn. Haven't taken an economics class in years.
The return on investment would be about -0.999999999999995

4616695.58 years for a block with difficulty 1, and the block would be worth 50 BTC instead of just 25. This means it would have been about a **billion times more profitable** doing it back then.

At the time scale we're talking about, we're going to need something bulletproof.

Wow, thanks a ton. Never thought I could earn beer with math.
That $7.28 is about the cost of a bomber of Stone Double Bastard, bottled at 11.2% ABV. As a 150 lb male, it would require one of these every 7 hours, or 0.0289% of the capacity of the entire bitcoin network to keep me continuously drunk.

Thanks a ton.
It took the entire bitcoin network 3 seconds to generate that .005 BTC. It would require the population of 21.11 billion earths from parallel universes all working perfectly in parallel without error (and not to mention the people it would take to support the lucrative paper and ink industries) to generate coins that fast by hand.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:03:09
Yep, this one was legit.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:38:45
Running a GPU miner on my laptop would take 830.07 years to find a block currently. At the beginning of 2010? A block would have taken 43 seconds, and would be worth twice as much ($30,000 at today's rates)
By the end of 2010, the same block would take 7.2 days.
I'm kicking myself too, but oh well.

Great, thanks. I don't know how many hashes are valid for each block, but given the  2^(256*2) operation, you have 7.45834E-153 % chance of matching a hash by simply flipping coins. At one flip per second, this is 3.1E136 times the age of the universe.

I do own [one of these]( I'll have to check.

Looks like many bike generators can produce up 300W if the person is athletic. So, take your pick of AISC's from here:

Unfortunately, [this]( "I MADE IT ALL UP") is all I could find about it.

The bit shifts, rotations, and XORs would be much more difficult in any base but 2, though. Base 4294967296 (2^32) would be the most cost effective, though.

Just takes one Urist to start minting his own coins from bismuth bronze or billon, and they're all set.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:28:26
Nope, but someone made one in Dwarf Fortress using pressure plates and pumps. They got about 1/10 of the way through a hash until the machine failed because they forgot to use a magma-safe mechanism somewhere.

Whoops, bad wording. I changed it to that when I got rid of the return on investment thing

Thanks -- speaking of bat shit, your tip works out to 1.3 lbs of guano (first amazon result, at least)

If I weren't heading to bed, I'd do it in terms of ants (4 mg, lifting 80 mg each)

Alright, so let's say that's 10 times faster than doing it by hand (you've obviously mastered doing these calculations with RPN), and the battery will last for one year of continuous use (you know, the solar helps, but not once the sun burns out). You can buy button cells  in bulk for 5 cents each, which works out to about 14 teradollars for each block you mine, or one nanodollar for every dollar you earn.
This might seem like a waste of your time, but this is actually **2253 times more profitable** than doing it by hand. Time to invest in Casio stock.

Appreciating art, perhaps?
