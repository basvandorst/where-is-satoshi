Which means you're currently down on average about 2k since you didn't sell

And my point is that it will never be adopted until you have a systemic economic collapse (which creates so many larger issues that your ability to exchange currencies isn't going to be what you are imagining).

Exactly.  If they just quit being impulsive and just ignored Bitcoin and invested in real things they'd be significantly better off

I'm not saying BTC is going to trigger a financial collapse
I'm saying the only way that BTC matters outside of niche subreddits is that you need one.
In the meanwhile, you have a silly little stock of tulip bulbs that Chinese billionaires use to launder their money out of the country

But obviously this is just shaking out the people who don't trust in the cryptocurrencies so that the true believers will be rewarded!
Just like how when people abandon using a state's currency in favor of bartering goods, people still holding onto those old notes become quadrillionaires

Except that you aren't going to get a noticeable part of the population to abandon your currency until you hit apocalyptic levels.
Look at any historical example of a country facing inflation.  When it's at a low level, people are generally content to keep using the currency.  When inflation spikes to the point where it isn't usable you have them swapping over to more stable currencies (in the modern world normally the USD).  Without that point of crisis, no one changes.
At the point that the USD becomes the currency in question you have larger issues.  The USD is the cornerstone of most financial and international institutions.  At the point where you disrupt that, you trigger global economic crises.  Your 2 bitcoins saved up aren't going to be very useful when the entire global economy goes to shit.

I just assumed parity of size since that wasn't provided.

It doesn't matter if you like it or not, it is not the basis of a functioning currency.  It's the basis for people laundering money.  As soon as they get their money out, they're not touching your tulip bulbs again.

You do realize that if you have a collapse of that nature in currency, the whole world will be so messed up that you aren't going to be able to cash in your bitcoins for anything... right?

He is the 48%!
