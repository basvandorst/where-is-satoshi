He might even came to know this when btc stopped flooding.
I don't think it was ever "planed" to reach this state. Time locking works here like in any other money storage with such function. If I was about to put on my tinfoil hat, [biased] would bet on NTP hijack, which together with little bit of internal info, could be able to preciselly set the points when BTCs will run out and also when they magicaly reappear. Same thing is of course possible even with sole Mark actions, but this is not his style at all[/biased]

1. yes
2. no
3. yes
And the number 3 is justifiable even by the law. If our personal data were leaked including our email addresses, password, IDs, passports, other AML dox, bank account numbers, BTC balances and history, it's just insane to think the judge would punish Mark for warning people. The leaked data's contained wallet stealling malware and some people were even stupid enough to put their mtgox password into it. A large number of people will now have their BTC wallets empty, their email boxed abused to gain access for eg. to other exchanges, will need to pay debts that somebody else made on their names using dox and so on... Not warning people and putting an antispam warning on the site was the last straw for me.

First, BF has no power here or in Bitcoin generally. What you are proposing is a horrible idea and if I had some power in that decision I would be against no matter how many of my coins would be lost even forever. Adhoc solution, breaking rules, possibility of hardfork, this is just not going to work... And even if this would be allowed it would take over a year to do safely.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:45:14
Well... there needs to be no evidence for a proof to hold. I assume this to be proven by exhaustion aka the brute force method because I cannot image anything else which would satisfify that as of coins *technically speaking it's not "lost" just yet, just temporarily unavailable*. What *else* could have Mark done to coins?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:16:42
Security of course was the main goal. Why the time got so longish I'm not sure... I would be too biased to specify. But all possible reasons are here mentioned somewhere I guess...

I'm not aware of such cooperation, sorry. Also, I don't think Mark has told anyone about this, ever... yet...
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:02:34
[big speculation]
By flooding I meant refilling the hot wallet from the cold one to the "warm". Warm wallet acted as a buffer between cold and hot. Bags of coins were there deposited automatically from cold storage and new bags send back, maintaining the set level of buffer by lock time and interval of outgoing bags. One day bags just hadn't came.
If he has coins he knows axactly where the are ready.
All what is needed here is injecting correct date to system using ntp connection hijack.

We were trying to help, but I guess at least gmaxwell would have no intentions to help... And his reasoning is very logical even with the ranting around (which I fully understand too). There are more issues with mtgox handling of Bitcoin way more important than this frozen wallet aka Bitcoin Futures. I would sure accept to help with those if reached out.

That is not a withdrawal but an internal dust sweeping/merging transaction. You can tell by the fee.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:01:46
I believe that this is actually an AML hunt. If Mark was the only that was ordered to keep his mouth shut, he had hardly any options left which would assure that his company will survive and coins were safe than to time-lock them as I propose in this[1] chat. I found many clues supporting this theory, the most strongest ones are AML requirement at bitcoinbuilder, not disabling internal transfers and refusing to explain this by Sarah[2], no answer about this from ne0futur[3]. I was also given only silence when I asked this Mark during one chat, but cannot disclose this as it was in private.

As soon as signing is implemented, I'll sign all balances stored by my instance, but I will not add a trusted timestamp without user redoing the process. If your balances stays the same in mtgox and your are not afraid of your email/username+balance leaking, you should submit rightaway, the more instances of the site the better.

You are doing it wrong™.
What btc_xfer_report cointains are rows of internal balance sheet for users bitcoin wallet. There are 6 possible type of record in this table:  withdrawal, deposit, in, spent, out, earned and fee. We were leaked only record of type withdrawal and deposit and I also presume that some rows are either missing or the database from tainted. Account balance was counted as a sum of all rows of specific wallet and therefore if there were a successful double withdrawal performed on it and both two record would be present in a table, account balance would show this and no possible loss of coin was possible. What was actually done is that the first row was deleted to cancel the transaction and new one was inserted to force a new bitcoin transaction to be broadcasted.
Other things that you were not aware of include internal transactions which were done outside of blockchain. You should also match found transaction which you presume to be a clone to it's two versions in blockchain.

- So you are saying that those credit card Mark is making have a validity date in the future?
- They might.
- Why don't he just make new ones with better date?
- He has smashed his machine to pieces and now he has not enough money to buy a new one...
- Was he stupid when he was making the last ones?
- Probably not, he was stupid stupid enough to smash his machine before even looking at the dates it printed, but he might had set it up exactly like his watches were showing. Maybe the watches were upside down? Or his cat left bunch of hairballs in the machine *again*!
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:54:56
All internal transactions between mtgox hot+deposit+withdrawal addresses are done with 0 fee and are dust collected periodically.
Hypothesis: The cold storage is outside of pool, the path to it looks like a regular withdrawal to mask it and if my timelocking theory[1] is right, there is also no dust collection done on them either. There was a lot of dust thrown on the network lately, anyone have a tool how to look for such hidden cold storage? Also if cold stored bags are periodically relocked, on majority of paths there will be more then one spot/chain of unswept dust
More filter optimalisation hints/ideas:
- first transaction of the adress is the largest one and this one only is eventually spend.
- many of these might endup back in the pool or none of it if whales were payed off manually and deposits were able to sustain withdrawals demand of small fish.
- forget about the behavior of mtgox cloud, there should be mixnets, sendmanys and other things just for them to look like they are not from mtgox.
If the last two points are true, there is no way to tell if mtgox has coins or not.

That is the reason why we will not find them in blockchain either. Only mtgox has those.

The problem with this is that malleated transactions that were causing DDoSes on other exchanges started to appear only after different problem hit mtgox. Mtgox problem was with them issuing incorrect transactions in first place, but they are all mined by eligius, nobody else can see them to be "fixed" and your hypothesis to hold true.

@_date: 2014-03-24 12:06:01
The leaked code suggests, that mtgox system was capable of having 'redirect' type of wallet (internal structure wallet) which would point externally bitcoin address and cause an authomatic withdrawal. I could think of only two reasons for having an address without a privkey stored in system as of now. One of it is coldstorage, the second one is used here.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:13:37
If he was a designer of the storage he might had designed it in times where no P2SH and multisig was available so he was looking for other ways to make sure coins were safe. He took an inspiration from safes with timelocks. As there were no P2SH available he couldn't really used a contract to provide deposit[1], but at present days I believe he would have choosen this.
As I imagine it, the aren't really any series or chains ot timelocked transaction, he's not reusing any addresses besides deposits and the green one and the cold storage is more or less consisting of bags of coins of static size (or random), each with separate "next transaction key" and next_time offseted from current time. When too many or too few bags would be rotating this way the offset time is either increased or descreased to fit the demand of withdrawals. Many thngs could have gone wrong, I've proposed one of it in article that is that the "current time" was shifted to the future or RTC might have been reset/corrupted which might led even to much funnier results. Or he might have implemented some automatisation of this time offset adjustement, which for me is a clearly a very bad idea.
Also now so called HD wallets are worked one which would allowed a "master key" to be securelly stored for those.
I'm not a studied cryptologist so there might be some fatal errors in my thinking, that's probably the worst mistake Mark did too: Asked for no help with the design.

No, not stolen. The key is destroyed right after the transaction is signed and only this signed transaction and a key to use it's output is stored. But you might be right on one thing, Mark is has said, that they are not "lost" *just yet*, which hints to a possibility that somebody has either both of this tx+key pair or the key. Possetion in both cases presents a huge deal of danger in handling of them especially during the time will run up and also when this pair is mined. I'd better not disclose any more details on this...
Destruction of the first key was on first sight a good security measure, but as there are no safety nets here a dangerous one also...
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:46:40
You are mixing stuff... We have a leak of incomplete transaction database and presumably incomplete deposit/withdrawal database. I have no proof that no other data was stolen. Person who make the leak of those two databases has a complete database of everything else with almost 100 % probability. Mark never denied so and he is the only "authoritative" source here. Therefore our data are not safe. That changes nothing on a fact, that one particular scammer doesn't have access to them.

I never did that, feel free to publish your log of it. I always screamed, that nanashi__ was a scammer and doesn't have any database. You can probably find me stating this even here on reddit.


I also never said this one... I said he withdraw more than presumed limit for size of hot wallet and that this withdrawal was more or less clearly sent from outside of mtgox system, he requested to send this through green address but this was ignored also. The part of order book is complete non-sense from your side as order book as to do with trades not with withdrawals. Anyway the whole point of that particular discussion was that you were saying that database leak is complete and untainted and I proposed arguments disproving it.

@_date: 2014-02-26 09:54:33
They can legaly broadcast it only after the lock is over. Before that happens, no Bitcoin node would realy them anyway. They cannot "resend" as in doublespending because the key needed to create this stored transaction is destroyed already as I've explained in the chat.
Mark tries not to reuse adresses, but I'm not sure, if they are also distroying all the keys they are sure they won't need again. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:33:24
Then there would be no reason not to tell...  But anyware condider situation when attacker has only managed to get the key. Mark cannot show us the locked transaction, because that would give the attacker both parts of the puzzle and unlocked some other tricks that he couldn't do up to that point. Mark cannot show use the key for the next transaction either and signing a transaction with it is useless as a proof if there is no connection to unspend output in blockchain. 
He cannot be sure that somebody hasn't got the keys, not showing them thus might be not only a good thing but also the only option.

The most probable way is that mtgox was flooded with faked AML documents and these accounts were then funded by carding or some other type of fiat fraud. To make it more harder to detect second account is used to "withdraw" coins using paybutton with external address target. As this account is in essence controlled by mtgox and attacker therefore never touches fiat, no AML was needed for long time. It is also possible that the payers account was just an empty stolen account already registered and verified or that payer account was robber by simple csrf.
Nobody noticed because no coins were missing and mark just focused on fiat side, blaming and oldworld's bank system with chargeback. This scenario was also raising the price and therefore the fee profits with it making it no big deal. Up until the point when large amount of mtgox's fiat reserve was frozen by civil (coinlab...) or criminal (SR...) courts' orders and/or the price started dropping and people withdrawing. To keep-up with the demand he tried going "naked" short with customers' coins. Or Tibanne accidenty the whole
