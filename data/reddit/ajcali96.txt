You can always find a bitcoin atm in your area and send it to your address on the exchange.  Usually always allow crypto trades and transfers.

The reason I’m not to scared about a bubble is the fact that a majority of the market is still playing with house money!  Think about it.  If you put $1K USD into crypto you invest a lot differently than you would .05 Bitcoin gain from some alt coin you just threw money at.  No one is going to yank funds out of the overall market until they hit 1 million and until that point everyone is letting it ride come hell or high water.

The transfer times are slow and in my experience the quoted price on the machines is 10% over market.  But if the market tanks and you need to get cash in quick to buy the dips it might not be a bad idea.

Agreed.  Keep in mind there so many newbies added daily and everybody has to be broken in and that takes time.  It’s not the stock market.

Sounds great.  They could use the Stellar network to handle the volume for virtually nothing.

Of course it was a whale which triggered panic selling as well as some stop loss orders.  It’s how they make their money.  Dump a bunch, induce panic, drive down into stop losses and collect the coins from weak hands.  This isn’t the stock market so stop treating it that way.  Technically analysis is only so useful and more often than not a self fulfilling proficiency...
