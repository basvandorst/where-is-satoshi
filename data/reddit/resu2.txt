You could use that same vault and put a usb stick with the bitcoins in it, at the location. Declare it on insurance as sensitive data with a monetary value of so and so.

security is good, the network is pretty much solid, the only problem is outside the network, exchanges are beefing up security etc, multiple other exchanges in place. 
Alot of the startup information had to come from talking to people that attended. 
online merchant solutions showed up:
Pretty much any storefront online can setup through them a way to purchase good online with bitcoins.
There was some discussion about bitbills as a solid plastic use, alot were available at the convention. 
I'll dig through the contact list for the other things. In the meantime try the bitcoin forums themselves.
also transaction fee will be changed in the future, as mentioned by the head of bitcoin dev.
EDIT: here's more information, there was a discussion on the bitcoin atms in design  where people will be able to buy bitcoins with cash. Its not expected within this year but there is already exchange integration planned.
also there was a map site that was there, listing bitcoin meetups and brick and mortar locations that accept bitcoin.  
There was also a stream recorded somewhere, ill try to look for it.

i think there was a recording of it somewhere, but i dont remember if a specific change was mentioned, more like it was going to be proportional to the amount in the transaction.

its happened before at a smaller scale, more likely someone or some group got lucky and cracked some blocks faster. I mine on btc guild and it happened a few weeks ago where we cracked two blocks in a row within a couple hours, making it appear as if the processing power jumped. As of the time of my posting tho, what you noticed seems to have stabilized.

if money is not an issue, water cool and dont give a damn.
also there are seperate gpu power supply.

You live in China? Land of the manufacture of cheap and awesome goods?
FUCK MAN START SELLING SHIT ON BITCOINCLASSIFIEDS AND BITXFIEDS FOR BTC
best way to contribute from china, behind that firewall, start a small business that deals in BTC. By adding more markets for people to buy goods with BTC you will contribute far more than mining.

the news posts haven't hit yet i think, press =&gt; more people =&gt; more buyers =&gt; higher prices generally.

check if crossfire was auto activated.
or if for some reason your device addresses are all weirded up
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:56:37
dunno howd to explain it other than data that is worth 100k, as long as you pay the premium for that value, i dont think theyll care.
@_date: 2011-08-13 23:46:45
well im not too familiar with diablo, i prefer poclbm and phoenix with the phatk kernel (I have ten different video cards so i use what kernels are the most optimal for each) have you tried their forum thread?
Otherwise, i think the new optimized poclbm should be the most efficient for your 5xxx series card on 11.7 catalyst, sdk 2.4
I dont overclock mine (I underclock the memory tho and set fan speed) and i get about 350-370ish per.
EDIT: actually why dont you just try another mining program to see if its just some weird thing with the program and your computer?
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:37:00
solar panels and wind turbines.
@_date: 2011-08-18 05:06:16
you should prolly sell it for btc lol,
immediately install 11.7 catalyst when you get it, also standard parameters is generally vectors and workspace 128.
poclbm with phatk mods and phatk 2.2 for phoenix are the two tops for the 6870 from what i've tested so far. I found poclbm more windows friendly, but for linux(debian) phoenix with phatk 2.2 is king for my 6870.
this is on sdk 2.4
should hit 330 mhash/s+ easily with light overclocking on linux.
300ish on windows 7 64 bit. Havent tried XP
@_date: 2011-07-17 17:44:49
any pics or videos of machine prototype? stability tests?
@_date: 2011-08-22 23:35:48
yeah i figured the same, but i figure the idea of having a physical bitcoin to be able to exchange with merchants at stores was the basic idea. Speaking of which that reminded me that someone also mentioned they were programming something where youll be able to create private keys to use as "cash" to use, with a faster transaction speed than standard sending. I didn't hear much past that though.
@_date: 2011-08-15 02:18:37
Well, before it gets to replacing hardware, I suggest trying another OS.
Try linuxcoin or BAMT that i mentioned before. Both can easily be downloaded and installed on flash drives.
for all we know, maybe something is up with the Ubuntu install and for some reason it defaults the device selector to always use either device 0 or 1, instead of both at the same time.
unless for some reason Ubuntu is assigning the processor as 0, and the video cards as 1 and 2 which would make no sense, but would explain some.
@_date: 2011-08-22 23:12:39
they are adding more decimal points, but i also think there is the potential for a fork to end up being a smaller denomination. It's just that the current forks dont actually change anything.
also as of the bitcoin conference, the fee is definitely going to change to some sort of transaction fee based off the amount being transferred.
@_date: 2011-06-30 05:25:16
It's because the bitcoin application can only read unencrypted wallet.dat
dunno if there is a solution yet.
@_date: 2011-08-21 23:25:38
@_date: 2011-06-19 01:51:36
or we can try to make more and more merchants accept bitcoins as money.

did you get a free copy of deus ex human revolution with your order? 
@_date: 2011-08-13 21:27:44
its the allocated ones, usually you need to set 0x0 or 0x1 or device=0 and device=1 for opencl devices in your settings. default should be 0
EDIT: you know what screw that. Here: 
if you want a functional machine tho, look up linuxcoin
@_date: 2011-08-14 00:19:28
weird, have you tried phoenix with the new phatk 2.2 kernel? i found it insanely better on my 6xxx series cards, like 20% over poclbm better. I found i lost about 5% mhash on my 5xxx series cards tho.
cant hurt to try everything.
EDIT: actually if you were using poclbm in the month before, and it crashed, alot of changes has been made, could try the updated versions again.

found some footage, seems like some videos were uploaded yesterday.
audio is pretty crappy tho. first video is gavin, skip to about ten mins to get to the meat.

I couldnt find anything from the discussions or any presentations from the vendors there but, I'm sure something will pop up sooner or later. 
I have confirmed with a couple other people who were there earlier than me that CNN and Wired did in fact show up, but I think they are compiling larger articles. Wired, was apparently compiling information over two months for a larger article from what i hear, but this is second hand info.
also i was wrong about overall stability, security is high and stable had it mixed up, but there is apparently overall growing pains, though its being handled. They are hiring QA, lol
@_date: 2011-06-28 04:30:20
no, get a msi g45.
