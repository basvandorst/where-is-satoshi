Shouldn't be bragging about their crypto. Also have multiple wallets...one wallet being the throwdown wallet where you tell them that's all you have and it containing a small but believable amount.

Why are they sending funds back to the originating account? Did you ask them to or was there a reason for them not accepting it and crediting your account?

Holy crap they look identical. Good catch.

This doesn’t seem tied to crypto trading. From what you said the bank doesn’t even know about your intentions to buy crypto.
If you didn’t have a lot of money in your account to begin with and not making large transactions, it’s going to send up a red flag when you deposit a $20,000 check. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:15:15
I don't think they expected you not to notice 2K missing from your account. I think it took them a full week to deposit the money from my ACH account into GDAX. 
Crypto exchanges are not at the levels of big brokerage firms. Their customer base exploded exponentially in the past year. No one was prepared for this. The crypto hype took everyone by surprise.
If you're wanting to get some crypto immediately you should hookup your bank account to Coinbase or make sure you deposit money into GDAX a few weeks before you plan to purchase anything. Three business days for Coinbase isn't really that long of a period. 
I get that it's a lot of money, and I agree that Coinbase needs to get more customer support. But this is the beginning stages of an entirely new sector so you're not going to get the first class service you're used to getting at a bank. People need to have patience as these new businesses develop. 
Also can we please not get the government officials involved in some fraud complaint without giving the exchange a chance to address your concern? Shit like this is going to lead to regulators stepping in. All of this happened in a span of two weeks...that's really not a long time. They will address your concern. I have filed inquiries with Coinbase too, and it has taken them weeks to get back to me, but I have always had my issues resolved.

Trezor actually calls this scenario the "5 dollar wrench attack." It's where you think your crypto is safe because you have it stored on a hardware wallet...until the bad guy gets a hold of the wallet and you and hits you with a $5 wrench until you reveal the password. 
If you create different accounts (with different passphrases/seed words) you can put a smaller amount on one account and have that account be the one you reveal in a robbery. Bad guy would have no way of knowing about the other account unless you were a dumbass and bragged about how you have multiple accounts.

If I got that scam in my email the first thing I'd do is change the email address on all my accounts associated with that email. I'd probably create a unique email address for every crypto account to see if I can identify who is leaking my email address.

I’ve been trying to get my parents and coworkers on board since the beginning of the year. I remember telling one coworker that he should buy eth when it was at $50. When it hit $80 I asked if he bought any. He said no because he didn’t take me seriously. I asked if he would start taking me seriously and then he said it was too expensive. Now he’s saying we’re in a bubble ��
You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. Though I really hate how people keep saying that crypto is bad because it’s tied to illicit activities. My response is that fiat cash is the most common currency in illegal activities.

Not for my Roth IRA. For Roth IRA accounts, you don't pay taxes when you withdraw. For example if I invest $5,000 from my Roth IRA into any stock and it grows to $50,000 for example, I won't be taxed on the $45,000 profit I made when I withdraw. 
If I invest $5,000 directly into crypto through coinbase or any other exchange, and make a $45,000 profit when I sell, I will have to pay taxes on the full $45,000.

I agree with other commenters that your fiancé should risk her OWN money if she feels so confident about it. This should be a team effort! She needs to take on some risk so she knows what it feels like going through the dips and not just the gains.

The author only used that figure to defend JP Morgan traders who traded bitcoin against Jamie Dimon's threats to fire them. Why fire them for doing their job? If I were a shareholder and I found out that he fired employees who netted a 1000% increase, I would be pissed!!!

Fuck it, I'm hodling until bitcoin goes to the moon or to the ground. If anything it'll just be out of principle. I'm not gonna let China or the bankers or the tax man kill crypto this easily. Decentralized currency doesn't need govt support and this our time to show it. Crypto is like a baby bird leaving the nest and now is the time to see if it can fly.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:06:14
Well to be fair, until bitcoin is more widely accepted by retailers and other businesses and stabilizes in value then it will always be compared to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:56:40
For what it's worth, I spoke to many coworkers and friends about bitcoin and most of them only heard of the name and are uninterested. The ones that have any bitcoin have at most a few hundred bucks worth. Crypto has still not gone mainstream even though you are starting to hear about it on the news. Plus, the current volatility of crypto makes a lot of people shy away from it. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:53:09
I think you missed my point. In a govt collapse gold will still have value. That's why gold prices go up whenever there is stock market instability. It has hundreds of years of human history to support that it has value. There are a lot of people that still want the dollar backed by gold. You can think gold is valueless but history does not support your belief.
That being said, my point is that I'm disagreeing with the article suggesting that people should continue to turn to gold. In a govt collapse, it would be easier and safer for a person to transport crypto instead of gold.

I don't get why every FUD article has to tie bitcoin to illegal activities as a reason to discount it. I'm guessing the most popular currency in illegal activities is FIAT. My favorite part of the article is when the article is suggesting people should go back to investing in gold for safe keeping. Yeah, if society collapses surely I can try to carry all my gold around.

I don't think a case should be filed, but I think JP Morgan shareholders should consider his public statement against an investment that has outperformed the stock market and when the company itself is researching the technology behind it.

I'm relatively new at crypto (less than a year).
I get that you pretty much lose them if you happen to send them to a random person, but what would happen if you got the address wrong and it turns out to be a non-existent address? Are the coins lost or does it come back to you as a bad address?
