Good luck driving your Ferrari without the roads that "theft" paid for.

Because unlike being partial ownership of a money producing asset, Bitcoin has no underlying value and relies upon speculation

Only the gain is taxed. So tax will never be more than the gain itself. But yeah, it cuts into your profit.

Survivor bias. You can't cherry pick two successful companies now and use that as evidence against bubbles bring an issue. There were hungered of business that went busy during that same time period

I'd rather have a picture I can ignore than a process accessing resources on my machine that could shorten the lifespan of my device. This will not be a popular practice with people who understand what it is. To those who get duped, it's malware.

No one is paying in Nukes. What kind of logic is that? Having a stable body in general of a very successful industrialized nation that puts it's weight behind the currency is what keeps it having a value. 
No amount of math is going to keep people continuing to raise the speculaction prices if they're not feeling it anymore.

Except it's not, because math isn't something that can cover debts. It's meaningless.

Users of those things don't want this. It's basically malware 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:16:09
The fact that it isn't does, though

Networth min for 1% in US is $10.1 mil. 
1 mil is 10%.

I seem to recall him losing to the old model in that movie. Is that really the comparison you guys want to make?

Not everyone is in debt.

Except all those things can generate value on their own. They represent something, or have a physical use that provides value.

You're *confident*. That is different from being *certain*.
You're only able to say these things in retrospect. It's like winning the lottery and then claiming that dumping half your paycheck weekly into tickets is a solid investment strategy. It happened to work out. Doesn't mean it's a guaranteed thing. There's a lot of survivor bias in these threads.

I'm just saying it's not an investment. It's speculation. But even money is backed up by the industrial it of the nation.

You can't know that for certain. There's dozens of competitors that could overtake it causing bitcoin to get left in the dust and become worthless. People posting on /pf are usually trying to get out of mountains of debt. Risky plays are not the way to go for them.

It is speculative because bitcoin as a thing does not have inherent value. Not like owning a piece of a company (which produces value on its own). It's not the same as investing in the blockchain tech. You still need someone to want that thing for a price higher than what you bought it for.
