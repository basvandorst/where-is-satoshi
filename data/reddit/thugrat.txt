That's basically what this is, except it's letting lots of people try brute forcing it for a try at the bounty.

Depends. If the bounty is high enough, anything is possible.

Last i saw the limit for withdrawal was '10 bitcoins' with no time frame given. Can anyone clarify?

It's a candlestick chart. It shows the starting price, the ending price (in this case over a span of 4 hours) and the high and the low during that span. If the ending price was lower than the starting price, it's red, if it's higher it's green. 
The yellow and blue lines are averages from earlier on; 12 and 26 hour.

Friedcat is holding the funds until the units ship, so even if they did all sell, we wouldnt get the dividends until after he's shipped em out.

Good luck with that. Few if any companies have released that kind of information. For what it's worth, ASIC Miner has been the most transparent and reliable of all that I've seen.

Thanks for posting this. I have a lot of interest in things such as this but little experience or places to check :)
I'd love to see what else you or anyone else has.

They mined on pools so they could prove their hashrate to the investors.
