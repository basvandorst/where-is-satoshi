Taking life-altering financial advice on reddit? Wanting to "invest" education money in cryptocurrencies?
Why don't you burn your money directly, at least you'll get some heat from it :D
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:21:12
The market isn't betting anything. That's just pure old panic mode.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:25:02
Meh. Anarchism won't save bitcoin from human greed.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:17:24
Re-read your post. And relax man, you sound reaaally tense.

Beginning of collapse triggered by crop failures around the world
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:03:48
Well, for a brief moment, there will be a lot of frenzy and chaos.

Copy of the page in case of change:














@_date: 2013-04-11 15:32:44
Yeah, it's rather sad to hear people thinking it's still at $120
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:42:44
Price is still ridiculous. It should be at 30$ at best (last stable price). People need time to reality-check, the bitcoin economy hasn't changed since last month.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:43:40
Well, even more people downloaded movies and music, and various governments still enforced sanctions...
I'm not saying it will happen, but the risk is definitely here.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:21:17
You're talking about the subreddit content ?
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:09:50
You've been using it? it's still not open to the public apparently.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:01:42


Oh the irony
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:35:30
Explain to me why it's impossible for a governement to enforce payment mode restrictions on legit businesses.

Alas, I bought 1 BTC, couldn't find anything to do with it, and after one year, exchanged it back. The revolution hasn't started yet :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:39:16
Me too... still waiting for 2 BTC, it's been 5 hours.
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:18:57
75 euros on bitcoin-central.
That's 96 dollars...
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:26:32
We're now at 57 euros, and falling hyper fast. 
Let's wait until the end of this madness, shall we? 
@_date: 2013-05-13 12:33:18
Hardly. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:35:07
It vastly depends on what happened to make it drop that far. I wouldn't blindly buy it at any price no matter the context.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:11:11
A good start?
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:46:17
very different, and yet, you hear the exact same things....
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:35:57
Thank god. It would have been a complete clusterfuck of bugs, abuse and errors.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:54:41
or $10 ! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:58:27
There you go. 
The "it's a new paradigm!" phase of the bubble. 
The crash is near.
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:24:57
Also, halitosis. And weak arms.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:02:40
honest question, I swear to Lenin
@_date: 2013-05-13 11:24:32
False. Wealthy and well-connected individuals in an anarchy can do that too. In fact, some do that today; Look at the mafia and third world countries warlords.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:59:50
I tried to explain that to a friend who bought in for $3000 at yesterday's price and now is all panicked. Sigh.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:31:39
Really? They just need to outlaw it. Wont stop some users, sure. But most people obey the law, and legit businesses can't hide from the state. it would kill the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:52:25
...let's wait until the end, shall we?
@_date: 2013-10-15 17:00:57
Most of western and northern Europe works fine. Sure there are various local problems, but nowhere near the level of dystopia you have in the US. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 17:04:15
I'm sure some people said Hitler was a decent guy, albeit a bit misunderstood.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:00:43
I can't believe people are not seeing the speculating frenzy. Gee people, listen to yourselves, all the talk here is 97% about "i'm making so much money", "holy crap we reached X $" and 3% about making bitcoin a useful currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:08:16




Fuck your antisemitism. reported.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:55
I want it back to 30$, and then stay fucking here for a looong time, so we can talk again about building an actual bitcoin economy instead of this pure madness.
Fuck speculation, it spoils everything.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:54:04
NO. PANIC! IT'S GOING DOWN TO 30$ !
edit: hehe :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:34:38
Then you're part of the problem. If everybody is here just to make money, it will end in pain and tears.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:02:47
Do you sincerely think governments and banks will let that happen?
@_date: 2013-06-17 02:51:11
Well famous quotes are bad, but a well chosen random, long enough, sentence from a book is probably fine.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:36:35


Hard? It's a one-liner:
"if you want to operate in this country, you can't accept bitcoins". See you later, legit businesses.
I wonder why everyone thinks "online = impossible to regulate".
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:43:48
What's wrong with taxes? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:25:42
The simple fact is, current price is still wayyy above the normal level, when it started to grow up quickly for no apparent reason (and by this I mean related to the strength and the fundamentals of the bitcoin economy. Euro crisis is not a *good* reason). 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:16:56
Yeah, and the exact same scenario will happen.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:55:15
Media reports =&gt; more people buying-in
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:18:11
Trying very hard to refrain my 'told you so' to all the bubble denialists.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:31:23
Guys. Here is a simple rule. Whatever you invest in some risky business should be considered as lost. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 09:16:17
I think you severely overestimate what quantum computing can do. It's not proven at all that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time (in fact the opposite is suspected).
In other words, hard problems will remain hard to solve.
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:25:18
News such as bitcoin-central being hacked yesterday, for example?

Dying from subpar health care is, unfortunately, much more probable

Until I see contradictory facts or scientifics theories, traders are just glorified casino players and this analysis is basically astrology.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:41:56


Yes and rest assured lobbying will be one of these plans.
We should prepapre for the incoming "bitcoins are funding terrorism" thing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:27:37
Bitcoin central too, down since monday
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:42:31
Why the fuck would they mix hexadecimal amounts with decimal ? This looks very confusing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:51:12
You people never learn.

Well it was quite predictable, wasn't it ? 
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:02:40
Ok, so it's a religion now?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:20
A bubble burst doesn't mean stock price reach zero. It's just a word for "huge reality- check correction".
@_date: 2013-10-14 18:24:04
Good and affordable education, decent health care, justice, defense... You know, this kind of stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:53:59
No. just being a jew doesn't make everyone else antisemitic.
Only people who ask heavily loaded questions and use jewishness as an element of answer.

Everyone is so enhusiast and without any kind of worry, it's so like the 2001 dotcom bubble...

Corruption is human nature, it will happen everywhere no matter what. A governement is said to work not when it has eradicated corruption, but when it hasn't given up accountability.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:51:49
Seriously? 
You don't see what's bad with asking a loaded question, and then use a religion/cultural origin as an element of answer ?
