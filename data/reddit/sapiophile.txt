I disagree strongly. Although the security level is roughly "only" on par with TOFU (Trust On First Use) keying systems, such systems do in fact contribute meaningful security. Combined with easy publicity outlets to confound and disrupt impersonators (should they even bother to try), attacks are rather easy to mitigate.
I am personally extremely excited about technologies like this that "solve" Zooko's Triangle in meaningful ways. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Robust, decentralized identity systems are essentially non-existent right now (until participation in the OpenPGP WoT goes up a thousandfold...); a tool like this is an **enormous** step up.

It's very odd that the key as given on bitcoin.org lacks any non-self signatures, in that case. At the very least, it demonstrates poor practices or knowledge on the part of the Core team.

The instructions given by the [Tails OS]( and [Qubes OS]( teams are pretty on-point and understandable, and the process and important considerations are largely the same (though of course the particular keys and downloads in question are different):
For a little help in authenticating the Bitcoin Core signing key, here is the Fingerprint I have for Wlaad's GPG Key:
    01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
But that's only relevant if you trust me, or trust that the key I got wasn't altered! The Bitcoin Core team could greatly improve the security of the situation if they participated in the [OpenPGP Web of Trust]( and organized or attended some [Keysigning Parties]( - something I encourage everyone to do!

I actually think this is a great idea. The existing Base58 system really is a bit awkward, and expanding bitcoin's resilience and usefulness in ways that don't require a complete running computer, such as with voice and handwriting, is a big win. Having had a number of experiences with using such media to transmit odd strings of characters, something like this really can make a big difference.
Also consider that voice and handwriting have significant security and privacy benefits in some contexts, compared to more-or-less requiring a computer in order to work with these addresses - and let's not even get into the headaches that needing a printer can introduce, when in many cases a handwritten note can be just as useful.
I would love to see this proposal given a formal BIP and be implemented in all bitcoin clients - and considering that the other format can remain supported indefinitely as well, there is essentially no impact on users who would rather not adopt the new standard.
And potentially adding something like Reed-Solomon error correction as exists in QR Codes might also be a very worthwhile feature, as mentions, despite the additional length. It may be possible to drop the Damm algo check character at the end, if using Reed-Solomon.

Actually, it isn't. It's possible to verify **session** keys, but there are no persistent user keys visible, which might sound nice, but is actually a big problem. Every single "secret chat" session must be individually verified or stands the chance of being victim to a cheap and simple Man-In-The-Middle attack.


Unfortunately, as I already stated, the actual core crypto code is very much closed-source. This is doubly upsetting because Telegram markets itself so thoroughly as being "open source." Honestly, this is so dishonest as to be nauseating. See  . And because of this, we actually **don't** know how the apps create keys and handle the exchange. ~~On top of that, their GitHub (which is a joke) doesn't even have an Issues tracker enabled, meaning that bugs are quite difficult to report, and secret.~~ *EDIT: I was mistaken about this, it seems? Not sure how I missed the Issues tracker when I wrote this, but I guess I did?*


While that is definitely a valid concern, the recent versions have actually made a huge amount of progress on this front. Development is continuous and very active, and the apps will only continue to get better.


*This* I most definitely agree with (with my standard reminder that folks must use [GPG]( and not the product called "PGP"!). Closed platforms like Android and iOS (and yes, Android **is** a closed platform, due to all the secret proprietary blobs of code running with superuser privileges, mostly in the form of device drivers, particularly of the baseband chip) are not trustworthy *in extremis*, and so **nothing** should be communicated on these platforms that could arouse the interest of very high-level adversaries (federal law enforcement, Google themselves, etc.). That said, of course, actually acting on any intelligence gathered in such a controversial way would be extremely problematic (for the adversary), and would likely require some form of [parallel construction]( in addition to the expense and paperwork involved with actually obtaining the intelligence in the first place. The expense of that should not be underestimated, and it may actually do quite a bit to tie the hands of an adversary, or force them to expend significant resources, even to obtain information that is "readily" available to them. Since there is **no** such thing as "perfect" security, what we should work towards is making attacks against our security as *expensive* as possible, and using tools like OWS's can achieve that quite well, especially in comparison to less-secure communications software.

Using a mail client won't make it any more secure (and in fact, it could make it much *less* secure if the client isn't configured to use STARTTLS to fetch messages). All told, any of these services are probably *marginally* more private than Gmail, but only marginally. If you want real privacy, you need to use GPG, running on the device you're using.

Recently the wonderful anarchist publisher, [AK Press]( suffered a devastating fire in their warehouse and much was lost. In the aftermath of the fire, I very badly wanted to donate some funds to their recovery effort, but despite all of their online solicitations, not one allows people to donate in a way that is not tied to their real name and identity. Considering the nature of AK Press's work, using a credit card to fund them seemed like a less-than-desirable course of action. I very badly want them to accept Bitcoin so that folks around the world can simply "throw some cash into the hat" for their fundraiser, while maintaining their privacy.

Still with no support for key/password changes, key revocation, forward secrecy, and perhaps most important of all, [Key Trust]( mechanisms that are the only real defense against easy Man-In-The-Middle attacks that can render "secure" messaging systems completely broken with almost no effort.
I understand that they want to make crypto more accessible to the masses, but suites like [Signal, TextSecure and RedPhone]( have managed to do that just fine while actually greatly **increasing** the security of such systems. Leaving out absolutely vital components for the system's security because they can't figure out how to design it accessibly isn't really excusable, in my opinion.
And then there's some other, minor gripes I have, like how they use bcrypt instead of Scrypt as their KDF, and how they [encourage people to send private keys over insecure channels like text messages](
I dunno, it's better than nothing, but I would really like to see the developers of these tools take security a lot more seriously if they're going to be pushing their products as "secure."

The better way to do this, these days, is to just boot up [Tails]( offline and make a new Electrum wallet (it's included in Tails), then write down/memorize the 12-word seed. Better entropy and it's a full wallet instead of a single key, so spending it becomes much simpler.

Yes, that's why I said they're "marginally" better. But it really is only marginal. Compromising a Tutanota account is a single subpoena letter or national security letter (not even a proper warrant) away, at a total cost of maybe $200. Compromising GPG used on your own device, on the other hand, would probably cost $100,000+. And if you're rigorous about your endpoint security (using [Tails]( for instance, among other things), that figure could easily surpass $1,000,000. That's a whole different class of security.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:41:19
I'm very glad that you did that! I encourage you to also direct them to my response, here.
DANE is nice, but unfortunately it actually doesn't address any of the points that I raised. The authenticity of recipient public keys using Tutanota are still vulnerable to legal compulsion, malicious intent or a hack against Tutanota's systems to create a 100% effective MITM attack, because the only mechanism for verifying the authenticity of your contacts' keys is "trust us." They don't even seem to display users' key fingerprints (or comparable identifiers) to allow proper, out-of-band key verification and certification.
There are also still no mechanisms for key revocation or perfect forward secrecy, so if a key/passphrase is compromised at any time, all previously sent messages are compromised as well (PFS I will give them a pass on, as GPG also falls flat, here - though it could be implemented, especially on a centralized service like theirs, using Axolotl Ratcheting in the same way that TextSecure and LookingGlass do it - and this would be a **very** worthwhile goal for the future). They do manage a kind of "revocation" when a user changes their passphrase, I guess... that's the value of an entirely centralized service.
If they're serious about addressing the very real threat of key substitution attacks, they're either going to need to start providing key fingerprints (as a minimum) and (ideally) re-implement the OpenPGP Web of Trust (ugh) and/or do something **really** groundbreaking and use one of the new, blockchain-based identity stores, like DNSChain, BlockStore, or BitAlias, which are the first real breakthrough for this important challenge in decades. They are fairly experimental at this time, though, which is never a good thing in any proper cryptosystem.
And, as already mentioned, they should really, really strongly encourage their users to download/install their local app and/or browser extension instead of relying on JavaScript in the browser.

I have a lot of respect for Bram, and he's an incredibly smart guy. While best known for inventing BitTorrent, he's also a pretty brilliant cypherpunk, and a large part of the genius behind tools like the [Pynchon Gate]( and others.
That said, I think Bram misrepresents what will actually happen in the event of a blockchain fork (that is, a 1MB chain and an 8MB or 20MB chain existing side-by-side). I don't expect both chains to coexist for very long at all, for three simple reasons:
1. Miners are in a business, and will very quickly switch to mining the chain that looks like it will "win," because their profits depend on it. The "losing" chain will very quickly find itself with an astronomical difficulty that nobody can reasonably mine through, leaving it stagnant for months, if not indefinitely, until the difficulty readjusts. This kills the (particular fork of) bitcoin.
2. Coins can be double-spent on both chains after the fork. This means that, just like the miners, some of the holders of bitcoin will seek profit by spending their coins on both chains. This introduces many, many unpredictable outcomes, but nearly all of them involve the slightly-disadvantaged fork being burned to the ground by fraudulent spends, from users who don't actually care about their balance on the "losing" fork. There may be some technical, 3rd-layer measures that could help mitigate this (perhaps a website that acts as a registry for double-spent coins), but the overall effect is that even a small disadvantage in one fork will quickly be amplified to a rapid crash and burn, similar to the mining scenario listed above.
3. Both of these factors provide fodder for a very vicious feedback loop. As soon as the "less popular" fork starts getting "attacked" in these ways, it becomes less desirable/valuable, and subsequently becomes even less popular. This then creates even more anxiety about that fork's future, which then drives even more people away from it. Rinse and repeat until it is a smoking crater.
All in all, I believe that unless the community is **very nearly evenly** split on this issue (which it does not seem to be), the slightly-less-popular fork is unlikely to be a serious contender for more than even a week or two, I would predict. The incentives are overwhelmingly pushing people to use the fork that looks like it will "win," and therefore even a small advantage will very quickly progress to utter domination.
Just my 2 satoshis.

First of all, I'm not proposing one minute blocks, and I would not. I believe you must be thinking of some other commenter, here. I do, however, feel that five-minute blocks would be preferable to our current ten, but this is not something that I feel vehement about - I simply prefer the increased granularity of confirmations and faster moderate-security transactions that it enables, as well as some better adaptability to sudden changes in hashrate.
However, I do indeed advocate for more block-data/time in general, whether through larger blocks, more frequent blocks, or what-have-you. If we go with one of Gavin's notions - 20MB blocks every ten minutes - then perhaps we can reasonably make a (woefully unsupported) extrapolation that the orphan rate might increase 20-fold, to approximately 13.88%. This is indeed a potential cause for concern, but it is also not nearly the true figure.
For one thing, raising the hard maximum blocksize does not mean that blocks will immediately match this maximum size - indeed, their size is likely to continue to increase at the same, [roughly linear rate]( that it historically has, which puts year-on-year average blocksize increase at about 150kB. Under that trend (which is admittedly unreliable, but it's based solidly in the data we've got), we won't be regularly averaging 20MB blocks until about 131 years in the future! Of course, the biggest failing of that extrapolation is that it denies any potential massive uptake in adoption, which is something I think we all expect (or at least hope to accomodate).
Regardless, this means that the *actual* orphan rate, even with a *maximum* of 20MB every ten minutes, is not likely to be a great deal worse than it currently is, for quite a while. And in that time, remember, bandwidth speeds will be increasing dramatically (reducing orphan rates correspondingly), and other hardware, infrastructure, and software improvements will also be greatly increasing the capacity of the network to handle this increase in data.
All told, while I do indeed agree that a modest increase in orphan rates will be a result, I think it's safe to say that it will not be a dramatic difference.

It seems that the two of you are talking about different types of "forks" - is correctly referring to a **code** fork, while you are also correctly referring to a **network** or **blockchain** fork.

That's why a better way to make paper wallets is to make actual **wallets** instead of single keys - this is easy now since Electrum has been included in [Tails]( Simply boot up Tails offline, optionally mash some keys a bit for entropy, create a new wallet with Electrum, then write down the 12-word seed and a couple of receiving addresses on paper (or even print their QR codes) and boom - totally secure paper **wallet** that can be spent partially, receive change, etc. To spend it, a person just fires up Electrum on any machine and enters the 12-word seed.

No, it doesn't. It means that the business is unsustainable beyond an arbitrary critical metric that convinces the owner(s) to terminate the operation. Those owners can still have billions of dollars to their name, if they decide to apply their metric in such a way (and most do).


This does not follow. There are other potential sources of power. "If (A -&gt; B) then (not A = not B)" is a very simple fallacy in very basic logic.


This is similarly (that is, fundamentally and extremely simply) flawed logic. In fact it's so bad that I'm not even sure that an actual logic equation can be made to apply. For one thing, the end goal of all power is not necessarily wealth. For another, an **absolute** guarantee of wealth preservation is not necessary for what you're saying to be delusional - there are obvious and undeniable tendencies that allow wealth to preserve wealth. Finally, I never claimed that wealth "is" power, merely that wealth inherently wields power, as a separate construct.


Let me spell this out for you with an example. If you approach a homeless person on the street and say, "hey, I'll give you $100 if you spit in that guy's face," and they do it, how exactly are you *not* exercising power, and/or how is that power in any way related to the state?

I'm sorry if I'm coming off as rude, I know that it's counter-productive and I don't intend to alienate you - but this is honestly such an obvious and egregiously bad choice that I'm a bit shocked. What makes it such a bad idea? Let me count the ways:
1. The add-on is not cryptographically signed in any way, and its authenticity (and functionality, including potentially malicious functionality) is entirely dependent on the security of HTTPS and GitHub's goodwill (and/or their immunity to lawful requests from a government - which they do not have). Due to how add-on containers like .xpi are handled automatically in the browser, it is also much more difficult for users to properly verify any potential detached signatures.
2. A browser add-on works in very close proximity to sensitive user data, both at rest and in transit, whether that data is related to the add-on's functionality or not. There is enormous potential for "collateral damage" in the event of a security issue.
3. A browser add-on can, either intentionally or inadvertently, leak through or bypass any configured proxy(ies) or forwarding schemes that protect the user's privacy, like Tor, Privoxy or I2P, or can cause other aspects of the user session to experience such bypasses or leaks. It can be very difficult to avoid this, especially in complex applications interacting with the enormous number of libraries and routines involved with a modern browser.
4. Users with Add-Ons typically use more than one. Add-ons may interact with one another in unexpected and dangerous ways, particularly when privacy is a concern. One Add-On may configure a proxy while another configures a different one, with undefined results. Similar behavior should be anticipated with nearly any network-enabled Add-On in the presence of potentially competing Add-Ons. With literally thousands of Add-Ons available on a multitude of platforms (including the numerous forks of Firefox and Chromium like Tor Browser, etc.), anticipating and keeping on top of potential conflicts like these is not a practical task for any developer.
5. Browsers are issued critical updates on a frequent basis, and generally are self-updating. Oftentimes, these updates introduce breaking changes or regressions as pertain to some Add-Ons, and the Add-On developer must release an updated version to work with the new browser release. This creates a ton of unneccessary work for the developer (you), and introduces risk to the user if some Add-Ons become silently (or near-silently) disabled, or even worse (though rare), if they should introduce a regression of some kind with undesirable effects.
6. Browser Add-Ons with high security requirements (like yours, or any that might deal with money or cryptographic secrets) may be vulnerable to exploitation and alteration from within the browser (websites), whether due to a drive-by 0day exploit or just a clever, malicious rival Add-On developer.
7. Passwords, cryptocurrency addresses and other sensitive inputs intended for browser Add-Ons may in some cases be intercepted or altered by other Add-Ons or even scripts running on a loaded website.
8. Browser Add-Ons are more difficult to secure than standalone applications, since they execute in the Browser's environment. This prevents any possibility of specified firewall rules, SELinux/AppArmor profiles, QoS, or any other specific configurations that may be relevant to apply. All browser Add-Ons must, by their nature, be run as the same user and with the same parameters and permissions as the browser.
9. Any potential debugging and logging are complicated greatly (or nullified) as well, for browser Add-Ons.
10. Advising **any** user to install **any** Add-Ons in Tor Browser is just a plain Bad Idea, largely for some of the reasons listed above. Tor Browser is very specifically and carefully configured to be run in its "stock" state, and any Add-Ons can (and probably will) introduce undefined behavior.
11. Browsers crash frequently (at least more frequently than most software) and this can interrupt the operation of Add-Ons unrelated to the activity that caused the crash. This can introduce undefined behavior in the browser, the Add-On, or both.
12. Browser Add-Ons cannot be easily daemonized for full-time, low-impact availability.
13. Browsers are a frequent target of Adware bundles and other miscellaneous Nasties which may intercept or interfere with the operation and inputs of installed Add-Ons.
14. The use of browser Add-Ons as applications in general encourages precisely the wrong approach to systems security by piling all your important operations into a single, conjoined platform instead of a modular, compartmentalized set of applications. On top of that, it does so in a high-value target for exploitation that is virtually always connected to a network.
I could probably go on, but I imagine the point has been made.
Please, I strongly urge you to begin planning to port this as a standalone application (it could even be in addition to the Add-On). It would be a lot of work, I know, but keep in mind that it doesn't necessarily have to be *you* doing it - a good Lead Developer can sometimes get lucky enough to organize a real team of coders.

This is wildly off the mark. Communism is strictly an Economic system, and the term itself has no bearing on political structure. Its definition is a system in which workers own their workplaces (aka Socialism), and all goods and resources other than personal possessions are held commonly by all.
The problem with "communism" (as the term is often used by those from the U.S.) comes from two angles: a regime may decide to follow Marx to the letter and create a "Dictatorship of the Proletariat," which then becomes entrenched and literally opposed to any actual transition to stateless communism, which is what Marx said "should" be the progression. In hindsight, this seems like a pretty predictable screw-up.
The other problem is that a lot of the folks who created or led these regimes (Stalin, Mao, etc.) either didn't actually care about a better economic system or improved conditions for their people, and instead just claimed to be following Marx because Marx is really a pretty popular dude, with pretty good reason. When people are super-sick of getting shafted by the *status quo*, saying you'll be the one to make all that go away is a pretty effective campaign tactic, whether its true or not. Just ask, oh, I dunno, every single U.S. President of the last two generations.
This is basically what [anarchists](have been trying to tell folks for a long time. Anarchists (overwhelmingly, anyway) want to skip over the whole Dictatorship part and just actually implement accountable, direct democracy, worker ownership of their workplaces, and communal ownership of non-personal resources.
Anyway, there's a bunch of communist stuff that's pretty successfully anti-authoritarian, like Catalonia in the Spanish Civil War, Free Ukraine, Tristan Da Cunha, the True Levelers (the "Diggers"), and even just any functional family or group of friends.
Don't get duped by the FUD machine - politics and economics are very diverse fields, and there's a lot more options out there than just "one or the other!"

It may also be worth pointing out that the concerns about slowing down the network are much, much less relevant now that blockchain syncing is done from multiple sources simultaneously - when clients would just randomly sync from a single, random source, that source being throttled would of course have much more of an impact. Now, there is a much greater benefit to having a larger number of lower-speed nodes to sync from.

First of all, I'm not proposing one minute blocks, and I would not. I believe you must be thinking of some other commenter, here. I do, however, feel that five-minute blocks would be preferable to our current ten, but this is not something that I feel vehement about - I simply prefer the increased granularity of confirmations and faster moderate-security transactions that it enables, as well as some better adaptability to sudden changes in hashrate.
However, I do indeed advocate for more block-data/time in general, whether through larger blocks, more frequent blocks, or what-have-you. If we go with one of Gavin's notions - 20MB blocks every ten minutes - then perhaps we can reasonably make a (woefully unsupported) extrapolation that the orphan rate might increase 20-fold, to approximately 13.88%. This is indeed a potential cause for concern, but it is also not nearly the true figure.
For one thing, raising the hard maximum blocksize does not mean that blocks will immediately match this maximum size - indeed, their size is likely to continue to increase at the same, [roughly linear rate]( that it historically has, which puts year-on-year average blocksize increase at about 150kB. Under that trend (which is admittedly unreliable, but it's based solidly in the data we've got), we won't be regularly averaging 20MB blocks until about 131 years in the future! Of course, the biggest failing of that extrapolation is that it denies any potential massive uptake in adoption, which is something I think we all expect (or at least hope to accomodate).
Regardless, this means that the *actual* orphan rate, even with a *maximum* of 20MB every ten minutes, is not likely to be a great deal worse than it currently is, for quite a while. And in that time, remember, bandwidth speeds will be increasing dramatically (reducing orphan rates correspondingly), and other hardware, infrastructure, and software improvements will also be greatly increasing the capacity of the network to handle this increase in data.
All told, while I do indeed agree that a modest increase in orphan rates will be a result, I think it's safe to say that it will not be a dramatic difference.
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:34:58
Technically that's almost as bad, though, since the constraint is on the size of the transactions in a block, in bytes, and more payments bundled into one transaction still occupy more block space.

Shielding isn't practical for any kind of portable device (laptop, smartphone, etc.) because it will add size, weight and cost which the vast majority of the market wouldn't buy.
And washing the signal out with noise is harder than you might think - the noise would have to be completely indistinguishable from the CPU's emanations, which occur at a fixed rate related to the current CPU clockspeed and have pretty specific parameters that may vary significantly even among different samples of "identical" hardware (due to particular imperfections in precision components like the associated MOSFETS on the board).
As said, implementing more robust solutions in software is much preferable to any such solutions, in order to remove the problem in the first place instead of to trying to compensate for it. I assure you, the people designing crypto software spend a lot of time thinking about these issues, and anything you suggest is unlikely to be news to them.

OpenPGP handles multiple recipients just fine as is.

I do like this proposal, but I have concerns about the 8GB ultimate cap in 2036. I think that trying to predict the future of Bitcoin so far in advance could leave us in a really awful bind when that limit is, *ahem*, pushed to its limit. We have no idea what kind of innovations might be a valuable use case for the blockchain 20 years from now (edit: or what about **120**?!), just like the folks designing IPv4 had no idea that a single household might need 100 (or more) IP addresses. And, just like with IPv4, I worry about an exhaustion situation at some point in the future after 2036 - at which time pushing yet another hard fork would be virtually impossible, even compared to the current debate (just look at the ongoing struggle to migrate to IPv6, or to finally get email off of SMTP).
I haven't seen the arguments against a "floating" hard blocksize limit (e.g., 1.50 * [avg. size of previous 2016 blocks]), but I feel more comfortable with such a "perpetually scaling" solution than something that would place definitive limits on a wildly unpredictable field. If floating limits don't make sense to implement at first, could it at least make sense to implement them after the final (8GB) doubling?
Very curious to hear the critiques against floating limits; I have followed this debate moderately well but have not yet seen a concise reasoning for why that idea was rejected.

That's a pretty specious claim, in my opinion. I would say that unimaginable historical exploitation, often colonial, as well as racism and predatory global finance (ie, the WTO, the IMF, the WB, the Ex/Im Bank, etc.) have done a lot more to keep those nations poor than a few corrupt polticians - not to say that those politicians aren't corrupt, or don't exert an enormous amount of harm on their people, either.
There are plenty of nations with absurdly corrupt and tyrannical politicians that are far from poor, and many poor nations with very progressive and effective democracies.
Not trying to tear you down, or anything, but I think it kinda dismisses some really terrible problems with the world to blame a few corrupt leaders for what has been some of the greatest exploitation perpetrated in history, over a period of centuries, by outside actors.

Although it's *possible* to view everything as a market interaction, that doesn't mean that we should, for the same reasons that although it's *possible* to view a family gathering as a collection of chemical reactions among big, wet bags of organic molecules, doesn't mean that we should try to direct that gathering as such.
To commodify something is to cheapen it - a simple truth of beautiful irony. When something is created, expressed, felt, or performed as a commodity, or even uninentionally commdified by existing within a system that commodifies it, it loses much of its *intrinsic* value, which is never wholly measurable. It exists to be a token, instead of a plethora of perceived things. Its evaluation is in pounds of rice, and not along infinitely variable scales - or even just free of evaluation at all.
An action in a devout marketplace becomes motivated, even subconsciously, by compensation in currency or reciprocal acts. From this "original sin" of the pricing of a marketable item, that item and the labor that created it are doomed to be separate from their own true potential and any *qualitative* value. Instead, *quantitative* value takes its place, and while the two types of value are not *completely* mutually exclusive, qualitative value is absolutely diminished by quantitative.
These kinds of quantitative evaluations encourage dishonesty - one needn't actually do something well, or craft a product of great value, but just market it well enough to fool others. I do not want to feel compelled to advertise on behalf of the things I do, and I certainly don't want to apply a mechanical, critical eye to the actions of those I love.
The simple truth is, even stale bread tastes better when it's free - and not just of cost, but of underlying implications. So fuck the market - I want to live like a human being.

Absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much for writing this out. That second method is indeed a much more secure kind of scheme than mixers, and perhaps the **only** genuinely subpoena- and hack-resistant means of unlinking coins. The first method, I would be very wary about using the same exchange account - I think it's imperative to separate the identities depositing and withdrawing the coins, or else it's still vulnerable to subpoena.
One improvement that I feel is important, though, would be to split the initial amount being anonymized into several small quantities, and probably introduce at least a moderate amount of latency between steps. The former reduces the efficacy of tracking the coins by amount, and the latter reduces the efficacy of tracking the coins by time, ie, why Mixmaster remailers can be way, way more secure than Tor despite using essentially the same technology.
Very interesting stuff, and I'm glad to see Monero being discussed in general. I think it's a very promising coin.

By having those companies be owned by the workers. It's actually quite a sensible and resilient self-enforcing system, with far fewer perverse incentives than the dominant order today.


In the former, the workers are in a dispossessed position and are forced to negotiate with the "owners" of property in order to be granted the means to survive. In the latter, those means are jointly owned by a group and each member of the group is both a worker and owner of those resources and/or the operations that convert resources into more useful things.

For them, there is localbitcoins.com, where they can get a very small amount (to minimize risk and high fees), then leverage that as collateral for later purchases through this P2P model, gradually building their available collateral up to a point that allows them to buy as many BTC as they finally want. Annoying, yes, but very trustworthy and safe - and remember that this is only for the small minority of people who cannot or will not have BTC otherwise available.

That's true. I doubt that it was pre-existing spyware when you were using TAILS.

Do you keep your TAILS setup up to date, upgrading it each time a security problem is discovered and patched (new versions come out about once a month)?
Do you always, ALWAYS ensure that you're using the verified HTTPS blockchain.info site, using their certificate with fingerprint 0C:98:9B:DF:B5:86:F3:1B:D4:F0:39:59:79:6D:E7:97:2A:A3:22:F7? Not using HTTPS over Tor is a ridiculously bad idea, because exit nodes can sniff and alter any data that's sent/received if it's isn't over a secure connection.

You don't need to retire the PC completely, or get a new one. You just need to format your hard disk and re-install an operating system (most OS installers will offer to format at the start of the process). You can back up any important files you want to keep on another drive (external drive, a DVD-R, another computer on your network with FTP, whatever), then copy them back over to your fresh, clean new OS. Just be sure not to **execute** any programs, screensavers, java applets (.jar), etc. from the old data and you should be fine. Malware can only infect you if you **execute** its code. There are some exceptions that exploit security flaws in programs to execute code without your meaning to, but these are quite rare and are usually patched quickly.

I can foresee multiple serious security issues with a design like this. For one thing, entering a code to redeem and receive fiat cash, potentially on a non-networked device, is a difficult system to secure sufficiently. For another, the entire unit is so lightweight that it is obviously not an actual safe, and is prone to being stolen whole and cracked open later. Granted it doesn't likely hold as much cash as a typical ATM, but it's still a juicy target - especially if the attacker might be able to figure out how to extract bitcoin as well as cash from it.
This seems like another classic failure of a company not considering security at the start of an endeavor that desperately requires it. I would be very wary of operating a device like this until it was designed with security as a component of everything it does.

Right. But the fingerprint cannot be spoofed (reasonably), so it's still helpful to have a known good fingerprint to refer to. Of course the question is - can *I* be trusted to provide a good fingerprint, or to not have the my account hacked, or have my comment edited after I've posted it?
Really, I should have signed my comment, but that still wouldn't protect against those threats. What's really needed is a robust [Web of Trust](
I'm glad you brought up those shortcomings, as I felt a little wary of my comment standing as it was. I was thinking about editing it to qualify that me being some person on the internet vouching for that fingerprint isn't necessarily valuable.

Dynamically-served JavaScript can be maliciously altered on the fly to do whatever an adversary wants it to do, including capturing your master  password directly. Being based in the U.S., LastPass is under legal obligation to permit the U.S. Government to perform such on the fly alteration of their JavaScript should they want to.
Furthermore, if LastPass itself becomes malicious, or if they're the victim of a sophisticated hack (and they're quite a juicy target for that...), then the threat extends far beyond just legal orders.

SD cards also have their own microcontroller and firmware. Although exploits for them aren't publically available that I know of, I see no reason why they would be immune.
An SD card hub is coded differently than that for USB, so the issue is somewhat complicated. Our best hope is that SD cards (and the hubs that read them) do not feature a similar kind of updateable firmware - but I know that at least many SD cards do, as I have read about people who run a business of "increasing" the storage size of SD cards by re-writing the firmware to access its reserved sectors that are normally used to replace ones that fail.

Errr... I mean yes, that's true, but I can't imagine many realistic scenarios where an adversary would spend more to attack someone than the damage inflicted by the attack. That's the whole fundamental security of the Nash Equilibrium, and so of course it doesn't protect against such a wildly irrational adversary. I don't really foresee that being a very realistic threat model for most people, though... If you think that such a threat is plausible for you personally, you are welcome not to engage in this kind of system. Most people, I think, will be quite fine with that "risk."

Ah, if that's the definition, then the specific application of all electronics is "electronicky-stuff"! Problem solved, every device is now an ASIC!
Unfortunately, that's not the definition. In fact, the fact that these "graphics processing units" are being used for mining, something which is distinctly *not* graphics processing, proves this point quite well. GPUs are not in fact Application Specific, merely Application Tailored. There's a very important difference. That tailoring of GPUs is being eroded every day, besides, as people develop more and more ways to utilize GPUs in a general fashion.
In a technical sense, GPUs are [Turing Complete]( architectures, meaning that they can run arbitrary code to simulate any Turing machine. An ASIC, on the other hand, most definitely cannot. This is the nitty-gritty, empirical reason you are incorrect. I understand that the language describing "Application Specific" and "Graphics Processing" allows the kind of wiggle room you're exploiting, but it's really just a feature of the imperfection of the language, and not actually a relevant basis for the kinds of judgments you're making.

Seems clear to me that Satoshi was using a university computer lab. Hashrate drops at the end of the school year (May/June), picks back up after some time to gain access to the lab the next year (October, etc.). I suspect the lowest dip in late 2009 was either an experimental configuration which didn't pan out, or an initial attempt to "wean" the network of hashes, but then Satoshi had second thoughts and decided to wean a bit less aggressively.
EDIT: What was the status of Testnet, then? Could we correlate this data with testnet hashrate?

Botnets are pretty much ruled out these days, thanks to ASICs. Unless you could infect an operation like this and change the receiving addresses...
@_date: 2014-08-29 02:24:25


I'm curious, so let's crunch some numbers. Apparently the current Bitcoin hashrate is about 200,000,000 GH/s (200 exahashes per second - wow)[1]( A super high-end GPU can apparently do about 480 MH/s[2]( Assuming all your bots have such a card, which they certainly won't (especially since most of them are typically business computers that are broadly LAN'd, because coporate LANs are a worm's best friend), that means that one million of them would yield 480 TH, or about 1/500,000th of the current total hashrate. That yields about **0.0505 BTC per week** with one million super-GPUs at your disposal, or roughly $25 per week at current rates.
Not really very profitable, clearly.
On the other hand, without ASICs, that profit could easily be many, many **thousands** of times higher. And further, if the algorithm used was GPU-resistant (like scrypt that's actually implemented properly, instead of how Litecoin et al do it), there would be even less specialization among miners, and the botnet's profit could jump even higher.
All in all, I remain convinced that cheap ASICs are a good thing for cryptocurrencies. My biggest fear directly related to them is centralization, but it's more or less bound to happen no matter what you do. I prefer to keep botnets out of the game for being the centralized authority (especially because they would be undetectable as a mining pool).

The point. You've missed it.
If it suits you better, substitute "ECDSA" for "SHA-2" and knock your socks off. The exact same scenario (in the general sense) still applies.
(Also, the security of SHA-256 is what ensures the privacy of Bitcoin addresses, which is not of trivial value, either.)

A reasonable theory, but limiting characters to mitigate DDoS would be like using a screwdriver to sink a nail. A better solution would be a captcha as you say, or even to simply rate-limit password creation attempts, which can be done in myriad ways. Besides, the resource use for hashing 60 characters versus 30 characters is a difference of hundredths of a percent at best.
There really just isn't any excuse. Even **PayPal** has a **20-char** limit on their passphrases, FFS.
I think the real reason may be that they don't want to deal with forgotten/reset passphrases. Either way, this is a terrible "solution" to that issue.

From a design perspective, neither of those are nearly as good as bitboy's offerings. What makes bitboy's work so good, apart from the technicals (good lines, color, proportions), is that it is simultaneously "fast/effective/futuristic" while also very "approachable/fun/engaging/exciting/cool" and in a real *coup de grace*, despite these achievements, is still incredibly professional on a level comparable to well-known brand identities like ebay, Intel, and others. Straddling all three of these characteristics in an identity is incredibly difficult, and doing it extremely well, as bitboy has, is truly remarkable.
Your second link's offerings are amateurish, unpleasant (even on the most simple technical levels - the contrasting bit|coin completely dismantles the branding, in addition to being difficult to read), and to put it bluntly, the typography doesn't hold a candle to the Ubuntu font used in bitboy's designs.
All in all, I think we're quite fortunate to have the branding we do, though that doesn't mean it should never be updated. It should definitely, however, be updated with something much, much better than either of those.

I used to be really opposed to ASIC currencies. Then it was explained to me that allowing ASICs basically makes it impossible for botnets to be worthwhile mining ventures. I worry quite a bit that a simple, large enough botnet could easily just make its hosts mine some CPU altcoin, and either 51% it (without anyone knowing, by the way, because there's no reason to pool that kind of total hashrate), or just create a huge incentive to infect computers and make them mine. Cryptolocker (and its progeny) are already an enormous problem - the last thing we need is to offer *more* huge financial rewards to people creating malware.
I came to believe that the best solution is a currency that mines with a simple, but definitely specialized ASIC - like Bitcoin. However, I do wish that Bitcoin used at least one other hashing algorithm, for future-proofing security purposes. It could still be ASICable, just have a bit of a fallback should some weakness be discovered in SHA256.

For that reason I would love to see Bitcoin migrate to cipher cascades for all its crypto operations. That is, instead of relying 100% on the security of ECDSA for transaction signing, for instance, the ECDSA signature would then also be re-signed with an RSA signature. Similarly for mining, where cipher cascades have already been implemented by altcoins - but unfortunately, I feel that miners are far too entrenched to ever allow that to happen (which is really a potential tragedy).
That way, should a fundamental crypto flaw emerge in any of the algorithms that Bitcoin uses, things will still remain secure in the interim and the flawed algorithm can be replaced in a subsequent version.
The cost is increased processor time and a slightly more complex codebase, but I really think that for a multi-billion-dollar economy, it's only sensible. Right now, all our eggs are in one basket.

"Top notch security" on the wifi network (ie, WPA2) is not actually any kind of countermeasure to this. The only thing that that does is prevent  unauthorizized people from joing the network in the first place. In the case of a public or semi-public wifi network (as this one almost certainly was) using WPA2 with a Pre-Shared Key (PSK or "password" - as virtually all wifi networks do) once someone is connected to it, they can easily intercept and decrypt any and all traffic that any other user transmits and receives on the network, just as with any other WiFi scheme. The only difference is that they must be "listening" when the device connects, to snoop the key handshake. For more info, see 
It's very important to understand how different security mechanisms work, and what each of them does and does not secure. A very common and often tragic mistake that many people make is to use one particular security mechanism and assume that they are now secure against *all* kinds of security threats. For instance, the common belief that "if I have a virus scanner, I can't get a virus!" Your insistence on WPA2 in this case is not too dissimilar to this, although I don't hold that against you and I don't mean to judge you or make you feel bad about it.

A very important note about Electrum and other slim wallets:
It relies on a server to actually track your balances, and the Electrum client simply engages with the server to actually do anything. This means that the server has full knowledge of the fact that your various Electrum Bitcoin addresses are controlled by the same person, and also has the capability to record the IP address used to interact with them.
For those with serious privacy needs, Electrum is not a good choice.
For those with moderate privacy needs, Electrum can be made to proxy through Tor, and there are even one or two .onion hidden service Electrum servers - but these servers (and anyone who can hack or coerce them) will still have the ability to know the association between addresses.

Oooooohhhh... that is an amazing idea. In fact, there could even be services that just store a larger cache, that could offer permanent (or perhaps just more permanent - a year or two?) retrieval. Of course, then there's two potential modes for the end user to retrieve messages, quite similar to the two modes of Bitcoin wallets - full sync and something like SPV, where the client only queries for relevant addresses. So maintaining deniability of which accounts are actually yours (from such a potentially un-trusted server) would require downloading a fully synced complete archive (perhaps with a "start date" parameter to keep things reasonable), but one could run a client that's a bit like Electrum that is very quick, at the expense of some privacy to the server admin (and anyone who can snoop on that server), who would know which addresses were associated with which IP addresses.
Hmmm, I wonder if trustless SPV stuff like this could be done with [homomorphic encryption]( where even the server wouldn't know which addresses you were querying. Wheeee!

There is not in fact a "real" way to audit *any* source of entropy.

There are standards and tools for evaluating entropy output, but against a malicious actor, they are essentially worthless. Their only value is in detecting *very obvious* problems with the output of a PRNG.

I mean, pretty much any centralized online service has to do exactly that, or shut down like LavaBit. There really aren't any centralized alternatives.
You might as well be hating on cars for having wheels.
Meanwhile, we should be working on decentralized and strong-privacy-enabled services that can properly refuse such requests. One example, which requires you to be using Tor or I2P to access:

Of course, you must then trust the operator of the site. But at least they can tell the government to piss off.

You can set up an impromptu mass kitchen with practically NOTHING. I've done it - several times. Especially if you actively gather donations... think of how many sympathetic families there are - even just those of the protestors - with an extra cookpan or bag of rice.
This bit of seed money can be just the thing to round out any holes in the things the kitchen "needs."
A kitchen is a major feature of most large-scale demonstrations that I've been at. It can be done, and quickly.

For everyday/small purchases, you can be pretty sure it's okay with just one confirmation. For medium-large purchases, it might be prudent to wait for four confirmations or more (the longest ever blockchain fork was four blocks long, which would have reversed a four-confirmation transaction. That happened That was a while ago, it would be less likely now because there's more mining power). Deliberately reversing a four-confirmation transaction with &gt;50% confidence of success would require more than 50% of all the mining capacity currently on the planet (if I remember correctly - corrections welcome!). For very large transactions, the gold standard is six confirmations. Beyond six confirmations, it is practically impossible, even with enormous resources, to cause any malarky with a transaction.

It was only patched after the hack.

Unfortunately there's not actually any way to implement such a scheme, since key decoding is done locally (ie, anyone can just refresh the environment and the key has no idea there have been failed attempts).
If the key pieces were processed in some way by a non-controlled third party, though, that could work.

I really appreciate this comment, and I'm glad you posted it.
I do want to remind everyone, though, that privacy isn't an all-or-nothing game. Compromising an Android phone on the baseband level, for instance, while *feasible*, is potentially still more expensive (in many ways, and not just financial cost) for a state to do than just requesting, say, a credit card statement. Intelligence like that gathered by such covert means would be basically un-usable to most states in most circumstances, for fear of revealing the collection capability. And that's a very real benefit, even if it's not very comforting overall.
Security and privacy aren't about being airtight - they're about making them as inconvenient and expensive for your adversary to compromise as possible, and even with potent back doors, we still have some opportunities to do that.
@_date: 2014-12-23 14:55:29


No security is ever 100%. Never forget that. While I don't think it's even remotely likely, it is absolutely possible for some unforseen exploit to compromise the non-exportability of those private keys, for instance.

First, check out the graphics on this page that have the heading, "How Tor Works": 
As you can see, Tor routes your traffic between a chain of volunteer "nodes" that bounce it all over the world. The connection from your computer to the Tor network is encrypted, and all the links between the nodes are also encrypted, but in order for the websites you access to be able to understand what you're sending them, those last links (between the Tor network and the site) CANNOT be encrypted, unless there is an additional layer of encryption that is "end to end," like HTTPS.
Therefore, if I go to  while using Tor, the last node in my chain (the "exit" node) is able to read (sniff) and alter(!) any of the data that I exchange with reddit.com. However, if I'm using  the entire session is encrypted end to end, and the exit node only sees a stream of gibberish, in both directions - assuming that the certificate is actually reddit's (this is where key trust and certificate authorities come in - you would likely get a warning in your browser if the certificate was fraudulent).
While this kind of traffic interception and alteration is also completely feasible on a normal, non-Tor internet connection (if you've ever run a "traceroute" to a website from your computer, you can see all the machines that are routing your traffic around, and every single one of them has this same level of access), that routing is usually done by businesses and internet service providers who have more accountability than a random Joe that can run a Tor exit node. And, because this is commonly known about Tor exit nodes, many people with explicitly malicious intentions may choose to operate exit nodes entirely for perpetrating attacks like this.
One way that OP can potentially have some accountability in this case is that the potentially malicious exit node in question is NOT anonymous. If the attackers used that same machine to actually withdraw the funds from BlockChain (not actually very likely, unfortunately), BlockChain will have a record of the IP address that made that request, and if it matches a known exit node, that node should be publically called out (and tagged in the Tor network as malicious, a functionality which is already implemented). In the (likely) case that the withdrawal was made from a different IP address than the node's, it's more difficult to investigate, but still feasible - most phishing setups still serve actual requests to the website in question, and so BlockChain would have a record of which IP address (exit node) accessed OP's account page, even if the node was altering the traffic after receiving it from BlockChain. I don't know how long BlockChain keeps logs for, or if they would be willing to dig through them that thoroughly, but I would see great value in identifying the exit node in question that may be to blame.
Of course, there could be numerous other vectors that allowed this attack to happen, and the exit node could be completely innocent. It's a difficult situation, and that is well understood by the attacker(s).

[Browser-based end-to-end cryptography will never be secure](
TL;DR: Since the code is loaded afresh every time you use the service, it is trivial for the operators (or a government) to alter it in a way that completely compromises the system, and users have virtually no recourse against this. **Use a separate, dedicated application for cryptography and stop trying to put in in the browser.**
EDIT: Apparently they do offer a local client download, to run separately from the browser. This nullifies this concern, and I'm very grateful for it. I would very, very, VERY strongly suggest to anyone using this service that this be the ONLY way that they use it - and be sure to verify the signatures of the local client you download before installing it.

The only one I'd heard before this was a malicious Tor exit node was stripping the HTTPS from BC.i and swapping out their JS with malicious scripts to get wallet keys.

At the link I provided, it's explained how unfortunately, even with WPA2 and the like, it's relatively easy to decrypt the communications for any host on the network, just like WEP.

Don't know why you're downvoted, this is a very true and very important point. JavaScript as a language is all fine and dandy, as long as the code itself is trusted. The problem comes in when that code is loaded afresh dynamically every time you visit a website. At any of those visits, a man in the middle can substitute that code for other, malicious code that could steal coins and still behave exactly as the user expects.
Using HTTPS mitigates this largely, but with HTTPS stripping attacks (as by a Tor exit node, VPN or any other kind of proxy or pseudoproxy), it's still not very safe from a rigorous standpoint.
This can be mitigated by providing software that users can install locally, persistently, provided with a cryptographic signature. It could be a browser extension or even a standalone application, but it needs to be persistent.
Perhaps someone should start working on digital signature support and ACLs for in-browser JS code... hmmm....

Oh, I getcha. Yeah, you're totally right. Of course, that's also the case with cash. Fraud and theft protection only come from third party firms (like Visa, PayPal, etc.) as a higher layer. There are already some startups implementing these same functionalities with Bitcoin, just as credit cards have implemented them for cash.
It's fundamentally an apples-to-oranges comparison, but of course people are still excited to use Bitcoin without this higher functionality, because we've never had "cash" that you can spend from the other side of the world, before. And there's nothing wrong with that, either, so long as it's an informed decision.
In coming years, as Bitcoin financial firms begin wielding some power - and perhaps most significantly, some advertisements - this kind of cash-and-carry approach to Bitcoin is likely to be much less common, and people will be much better informed about it.

**This is a much bigger deal than people might think.** In any kind of secure communications, the threat of a Man in the Middle attack that substitutes adversary-controlled public keys for those of the person/service you're trying to reach is the most serious and difficult hurdle to overcome. It's true of OpenPGP systems, OTR, HTTPS websites, and virtually any secure communications protocol. The two main solutions to this that we have now are both pretty bad - OpenPGP systems have the [Web of Trust]( (which very few people know about or even [know the importance of]( and HTTPS websites have Certificate Authorities (which can be and have been hacked, and are easily subject to government compulsion to upend the security of any website connection), and chatting with OTR still requires a voice conversation with the other party - if you could even recognize their voice! - to verify the other party's Public Key Fingerprint, or a pre-shared secret code that can be verified using the [Socialist Millionaire Protocol]( in-band - but good luck if your only channel of communication with them before that is online (an adversary could just tamper with your pre-sharing of the code).
Having a persistent, extremely secure public record of authentic public keys for any person or service could obviate all of these clunky solutions, and go a long way towards ending government surveillance, ecommerce hacks, phishing, and more. This is basically the biggest unsolved problem in cryptographic systems right now, and it's very exciting that we may be approaching a real, secure solution to it.

My opinion is this: folks, please, stop insisting on the Chrome-ification of everything - for security or cryptography software, the only reasonable option is to use a separate program whose code is stable and stored on your computer, so that you can trust it to be the same code that it was before.

With any public key infrastructure, a strong means of authentication and/or trust is absolutely essential to prevent Man-In-The-Middle attacks. What means does your service offer to authenticate the key of a person I communicate with, so that I know it isn't one that has been switched by a malicious actor?
With GPG, the Web of Trust does an excellent job of assuring such authenticity. Does your service allow users to sign (authenticate) the keys of other users, or have any capabilities for hosting a key-signing party of other means of building a Web of Trust?

What about the fact that I don't agree that your claim to private property (as stolen from the commons, originally - almost invariably by force and brutal violence) is legitimate? It is in fact you who would require force (private police, courts, prisons, et al) in order to enforce your ideals.
Anarchism requires no centralized force - indeed, anarchists advocate for autonomous and pervasive self-determination and resistance to exploitation. Where exactly are you pulling this myth of central authority from?
Further, anarchism (and by the way, it's not called "anarcho socialism," - just "anarchism") is not a rebranding of socialism, and that you would say that only proves your profound ignorance of history. It makes use of Marx's theories (as do most modern economic models) but contention has long been a feature between many Marxists and anarchists. Please, read up on the Internationales, the Spanish Civil War, Proudhon, Stirner, Kropotkin and others, and cease your silly attempts at historical revisionism.

I would strongly disagree.

You're right, though BitPay might source a market order across multiple exchanges, but that has no bearing on what price Coinbase is quoting at.
For instance, right now at that page, BitPay's price is 383.95 USD, while Coinbase's is $384.76. Therefore, spending through a Coinbase merchant, your BTC will go further (although that is certainly less than a 1% difference).

If that's the case, then you don't understand how cryptography works (and breaks).
A novel attack, mathematical or otherwise, could appear overnight against one or more of the algorithms or implementations used by Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies, and they would almost instantly be worth next to nothing.
Sure, the protocol could be re-developed and hard forked, even going so far as to use proof-of-burn for users to migrate onto a new blockchain (if the attack would still allow old coins to have value), but even with such a "recovery," confidence in cryptocurrencies would be tremendously diminished, probably irreparably.
It may not be enormously likely, but it is a possibility, and it's one to take seriously.
I am a fan of Bitcoin, but I understand its limitations, and I advise everyone else to do the same. I do not think it's wise to invest all of one's savings into something that could be broken with a single whitepaper.

No, not necessarily. While it is true that HTTPS content cannot reasonably be modified in transit, the exit node can still perform a slightly more sophisticated attack which relays your interaction with the site a little more plainly. This would, however, redirect you to the http:// address, or it could potentially send you to some phishing url with an impostor certificate (perhaps bluckchain.info or the like). The attack would still be communicating with BC.i via HTTPS, but your connection to the exit node would be insecure or improperly secured.

That's the mainstream story that I've seen in the news. But it just doesn't seem like the full picture, to me - for one thing, low-ROI petro/gas extraction (like shale, tar sands, etc.) isn't going away, unless the Sauds can depress prices indefinitely, which of course they can't. Sure, they can score a little bit of a temporary one-up against inefficiently-extracted crude, but it's hardly a game-changer in the long run.
The U.S. expends an **incredible** amount of money, arms, diplomacy and global credibility in order to maintain distressingly close ties with the Sauds. Keep in mind that this is a nation that's a nexus for IS (and other Sunni extremist) fundraising and a nation that [sends rape survivors to prison]( The kind of bending over backward that the U.S. goes through to maintain that kinship is not for nothing, and I think that this is precisely the kind of marker that the White House could call in for just this type of situation. If I'm correct, then this is indeed one of the most cunning plays of economic warfare ever conducted, and the costs are outweighed enormously by the damage inflicted (on Russia and Iran).
Who knows which incentive came first, digging at Russia or the Sauds digging at tar sands - they're both strong, and they're not mutually exclusive by any stretch. But the timing is definitely suspicious, as the conflict in Ukraine is still quite a heated matter, and the more direct economic sanctions that have been deployed against Russia have had only limited impact.
Can I prove it? Of course not. Am I sure of it? Nope, not that either. But it sure does fit right in.

* Wait 'til many of them get promoted to Entry Guard status
* Send a moderate amount of strangely-crafted packets that induce the hidden service's tor instance to decide that its current circuit is unreliable or malicious
* Repeat above step until it constructs a circuit that's completely routed through nodes you control
* Access the targeted hidden service with a distinctive traffic pattern and look for a similar traffic pattern directed at a hidden service endpoint.

Folks really need to understand that all of Circle's rhetoric around "insurance" is filled with weasel words. "Up to" the full value of the account. "Subject to Marsh Insurance..." The insurer (Marsh) plainly states that their coverage is only up to $100 per account. If you think for even a second that Circle will somehow, out of the goodness of their heart, actually pay out any more than $100 should any coin go missing, you're being quite naive, in my opinion.
Insurance is a very valuable thing, but first one ought to make sure that it actually provides the coverage you need. If it doesn't, as in the case of Circle, that needs to be considered very seriously. If a comparable service comes around that states, **unambiguously**, that accounts are insured for their **full** amount, then I would say that that's a service worth using. At the moment, no such service exists.

No, not nearly. I mean, it *can* be - most practical cryptosystems require strong random numbers at some point of their operation, and when those numbers aren't random enough, [some really bad stuff can happen](
But the reason why it's not a systemic flaw is that we **do** in fact have good pseudorandom number generators, which are open source, with audited code, and well-tested.
It mostly becomes a problem if the PRNG code is closed-source, or if the actual generator is different than the code it claims to be compiled from. In [some cases]( the PRNG is in fact compromised from the get-go, but thankfully this is typically discovered in auditing. Good operating systems like GNU/Linux and *BSD rely on multiple randomness functions combined together to produce a net output that can still work even if some of the functions are bad.

Nope! While anarcho-syndicalism (and Anarchism in general) is entirely opposed to the "absentee ownership" of resources for the purpose of generating profit, it still has tremendous respect for *possessions* - the things that people actually use and rely upon. Anarchists are pretty universally in favor of such private possessions. The distinction between possessions and property is that one consists of the things you use, and the other consists of the things you "own" in order to generate profit, and little else. So, your family home and land that your family uses to survive is a possession, but a capitalist factory that's held by investors to generate profit is property, and would be justifiably reclaimed by its workers under anarcho-syndicalism. A simpler example might be a real estate company that "owns" many houses, and uses them only to charge others rent to live in them, but has no actual stake in the housing except to generate profit.
The concerns about the origins of the private property we have today are definitely very important, and very valid - virtually **all** the "property" that is "owned" today was basically stolen at the end of a gun (or a sword, or a smallpox-laden blanket, or...). Before it was, the most common understanding of the land and resources of Earth was that they were shared among all people, or owned only by God, and that those occupying it were only "stewards" of that land, preserving its use for others and for the future. That most anarcho-capitalists seem not to mind the horrific histories that upended that paradigm is truly a fundamental break in the logic of their ideal, in my opinion.
From an anarchist perspective (that is, not a capitalist one), the primary difference between stateless capitalism and anarchism or anarcho-syndicalism is that the capitalist system perversely relies on hoarding as much of the useful resources of the world as "property" away from a majority of the population, so that members of that population are forced into an unfair bargaining position where they are then compelled to sell their own labor in order to survive. Otherwise, since the resources around them are already someone else's "property," they have no means to simply live and sustain themselves, but instead must buy the things that they need.
I honestly believe that the only logically consistent and/or "just" way to establish stateless capitalism would be to immediately render all property "ownership" null and void, and start from scratch, and probably without the ability to "buy" property at the start. But of course it quickly becomes a problem again, as property changes hands to become centralized, and as people become dispossessed of the things they need, the market for their labor becomes less and less free. That any capitalist can claim that a bargain between an investor and a worker who will starve without employment is **anything** like a "free" market decision is frankly delusional, in my opinion.
Anyway, sorry for the rant. If you'd like to learn more, I recommend checking out or [An Anarchist FAQ](

I appreciate your humility, the "infallible redditor" archetype seems to be gaining ground every day, around here. And I hope that my tone wasn't too harsh.


You're right, and that's actually my biggest concern about these "ASIC-proof" coins - they're not actually ASIC-"proof" - they would just require ASICs that are **tremendously** complex and **expensive** (much, *much* more expensive than current BTC ASICs), which would in fact "centralize" the mining power even more. This could, in fact, be disastrous - it would have all the aspects that ASIC critics are concerned about, but greatly increased.
In fact, my opinion of ASIC-resistant coins was completely reversed once this was explained to me. It seems that having a coin that can use fairly cheap, simple ASICs (like Bitcoin) might actually be the ideal compromise, because it keeps botnets from dominance (since most bots won't be hooked up to ASICs) while still allowing many thousands of people to mine with ASICs who want to.
All in all, it's a tricky situation, and one that we would all do well to consider at length.
Food for thought.

Hell, I'm a communist anarchist, and I don't even like currency *in general*. I certainly don't like regulations and central banks.
My interest in bitcoin is entirely in state-disruption, potential moderate advances in liberty (moderate in that I think a "libertarian" bitcoin-infused future is likely a step up from what we've now got, and would be a better position from which to reach true liberty, which I would describe as communist anarchism), and personal resource accumulation (which is indeed partially hypocritical, as are a great many things that anyone does ((you pay sales taxes, I imagine)), but is a necessity in the world we're in and the personal position I'm in).
Sorry if that's a bit confusing with all the parantheses, but please, don't be so quick to paint a picture of everyone who disagrees with you. Just as I despise "anarcho-" capitalism as an ideal, I still entertain each person espousing it as an individual with their own opinions, and absolutely embrace the possibility of solidarity with them in shared goals (and of course, an eventual hope that they'll realize some of the shortcomings of their ideology, but that is secondary).

Indeed - my curiosity got the best of me and I played around with the 0.99^x graph myself. It seems that after about 200 commits, the balance would be at about 11% of the original, which is pretty depleted. After 100, the balance is about 37%. After 50, it's at about 58% of the original amount. After **300** commits, it's only got about 3% left.
Seems like a pretty good ratio, to be honest, though there's still a decent "cushion" if the operators wanted to borrow against it (it's highly unlikely that even 50 commits would be made in less than, say, a week).

Ahhh, but I think the scenario that I imagine is where the user enters an HTTPS URL, but the exit node strips that to what is basically a request, right from the very start, of an HTTP URL.

If you think that it won't eventually happen to SHA-2 and ECDSA (both of which have already revealed weaknesses, I should add - [1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( you are sadly mistaken. MD5 lasted about 15 years before being broken. SHA-1 about the same, although its failure is not as grievous (though it's likely to become completely broken within a few years). The original DSA is on track for about the same lifespan, and DSA1024 keys are already considered insecure.
In fact, only a couple of algorithms have withstood the true test of time (I'm thinking of 3DES and RSA, here, mostly), and there was almost no way to predict that that would be the case from their origins (well, possibly RSA, as its design is very intuitively secure).
ECDSA and SHA-256 are certainly newer than these dead and dying algorithms, and have learned important lessons from the failures of their ancestors, but are not immune to such catastrophic failures themselves.
And I absolutely did **not** "handwave away" your argument - the impact of changes required for traditional finance to migrate ciphers and the impact of changes required for Bitcoin to migrate ciphers are wildly incomparable. As you mention, Heartbleed was "just a bug," but as far as the traditional digital finance world is concerned, a cipher migration would be handled with almost identical ease, and has almost identical parameters. The same would absolutely **not** be true of Bitcoin, and it's **incredibly** important to understand that.

Electrum is an enormous privacy compromise. The server that your electrum client connects to (and anyone capable of spying on it effectively) knows your IP Address and all the addresses of your wallet(s). It's an immediate "bridge" between addresses that ought to be distinct, on top of that tied directly to the IP address you use.
For many people, that's not a problem. But for some, it's a very big deal.

Uhhh... cypherpunks had come up with pretty every tenet of bitcoin by the mid-90s. There were also many small projects before bitcoin that were extremely similar (HashCash especially, but even Digital Monetary Trust, e-gold, etc. which had different mechanics but similar goals).

A sidechain is just **any** ledger that "syncs" with the main Bitcoin blockchain from time to time. In its simplest form, think of it like a bar tab. You start a tab at the bar, get some drinks, then when you're heading home the total is settled with an actual monetary transaction. Sidechains would work similarly, where the "settling" is the actual Bitcoin transaction (and potentially with one at the start, as well). Settlement could happen every ten minutes or every ten months, depending on the properties desired.
An altcoin, on the other hand, is just a different cryptocurrency than Bitcoin, with its own blockchain (in most cases).

You **do** realize that even after the block size limit is raised, blocks will probably not be much above 1MB for quite some time, right? Technology **does** progress over time, you know.
Besides, even at full 20MB blocks right now, we'd still have plenty of folks able to run nodes - just fewer of them. It would be far less damaging (by any reasonable estimate) than the network **failing to process payments *in toto*.**

Yes, but what would be scary would be the price the next day. Confidence would be shaken tremendously, and rightly so.
It's for this reason and others that I strongly feel that multi-algorithm cascades should be integrated into Bitcoin as soon as possible, in the event of an algorithmic weakness discovery. At the moment we have all of our eggs in one basket, as far as ECDSA and SHA-256 are concerned, and there's honestly no need for that except for a very slight decrease in processing time.
Of course, nobody wants to do it pre-emptively, now, (even though it's a very good idea), because of how much infrastructure has already been created around the existing scheme (mining ASICs, Trezor, various Bitcoin clients and libraries...) But it's only going to become **more** expensive to migrate to better security in the future, and the costs of doing it reactively, instead of proactively, are exponentially greater. I think it's incredibly important to not let investments in a currently fragile technology deter us from making that technology tremendously more secure. It's sad to me when I see the prejudice of that investment, the "don't rock the boat" mentality, so prevalent in any community, as it is prominently so in the Bitcoin world.

Yes, it is supposedly much better, now. I haven't looked into it in-depth, myself, but that's the word.
Cryptocat does not (theoretically) suffer the fundamental problem discussed in the link I provided, above, because it is a static piece of code that's run from the local computer. The problem with ProtonMail is that the code is loaded dynamically every time the site is visited - so it's just one National Security Letter (or its international/Swiss equivalent) or a decent hack away from serving malicious JavaScript instead of what it should be serving - and the end-user would have virtually no way to know.
Since CryptoCat is a program installed (and hopefully verified) in advance, its operating code cannot be substituted as easily. HOWEVER, similar attacks are possible and should be considered, such as:
* The original download being tampered with - verify the installation file(s) against known, trusted hashes and/or with GPG digital signature(s) from the author or another trusted party. Their Git repository releases may be GPG-signed (I'm not sure, but I hope so), in which case after cloning they can be verified with the command "git tag -v [[release/tag name, most recent is 2.2.2]]"
* The software auto-updating itself to a malicious version (see  ) - auto-updates can be disabled, and apparently the Git version also will not auto-update (for the time being).
* The binaries themselves being malicious. This can be mitigated by building the extension yourself from verified (e.g., GPG-signed) source code.
a note: Many of these mitigations rely on GPG digital signatures. It must be considered that the key used to make those signatures may not be authentic - this is one of the most crucial and often-overlooked parts of using GPG (or any OpenPGP-compliant system). If I were the NSA, I could modify the files in a download to contain malware, and be signed NOT by the proper author's key, but by a separate key that looks like the author's (same name, email, etc.). The signature would verify as "GOOD," but unless the key used is known to actually be the key of the author, that doesn't have much value. I could also modify (either in transit or on the server) the official website to list the fraudulent key as the "official" key for the author(s). This is where the OpenPGP Web of Trust comes in, and it's absolutely vital. I encourage everyone to read up on key trust and authentication, and [participate in and organize as many Key-Signing Parties as they can](

Ah, I understand now, but that's hardly a significant pressure, in my opinion. I would be shocked even if the advantage for larger miners was greater than 0.5% or so, which of course is significant in the razor-margin mining field, but still not exactly disastrous.

It's not only very well designed, it is literally the basis of pretty much the **entire modern paradigm** of secure, asynchronous messaging, and was the first implementation of reliable asynchronous perfect forward secrecy with Axolotl Ratcheting, designed by an anarchist cryptographer who discovered (and helped patch) one of the most significant bugs in OpenSSL in its entire lifetime. Seriously, check out some crypto mailing lists sometime - you'll see all kinds of discussion about TextSecure, and virtually nothing about Wickr (though you might see some occasional things about Telegram's terrible design).
Wickr's **stated** design is indeed very good, and so is its *marketing,* but unfortunately, those kinds of voluntary blurbs are all we have to go on to evaluate the product. The actual way that it works (if it does at all) is completely secret, and being based in the U.S., it's almost inconceivable that the NSA hasn't pressured them to include a backdoor of some kind. The  question to ask with **any** crypto product, **anywhere**, is "where is the code?" If the folks making it say, essentially, "we won't show you," then that's the only answer there needs to be.

Nonsense. Everyone and their mother in this debate, on both sides, is saying that trustless, off-chain solutions will become necessary no matter what, and are a wonderful and valuable service. Everybody loves them, knows that we'll need them, no matter the max blocksize. People are already working on their development, from many angles, and anyone who gets it right - again, regardless of the max blocksize - stands to do pretty well by that innovation. And they know that.
Sure, a little bit of a fire under our asses might get us those solutions - what - maybe six months earlier? A year? But they're coming regardless, and they're intensive projects to develop, regardless.
A metaphor for the argument you're making, in my mind, is like someone saying this: "The way that we should address the obesity problem in the first world is to put starving tigers all over the place, to encourage people to run more (to escape the tigers chasing them)." Will it provide incentive? Sure! But is it really the best way to achieve the larger, overarching goal of a healthy population? Of course not!
This kind of "tough love" almost invariably ends very, very badly. Just ask a hundred professional animal trainers, and you'll hear a hundred experts say that providing rewards is far, far more effective than threatening punishment. Of course a crypto-economy is a far cry from an animal's behavior, but I think the principles are still valid, and worth considering.
Why wouldn't we just set the max blocksize to 20MB (or whatever amount), once (no increases), and then let the off-chain solutions **actually start existing** before we decide to **become dependent on them!?** I mean, what you're talking about is a leap of faith, towards something that doesn't even exist yet!

But isn't offloading onto individual services' sidechains an **increase** in centralization?
And if the increase does happen, what real "centralization" will **really** happen? I mean, let's think about it: Yes, some people will have to shut down their full nodes (after quite a while, I should add, since *actual* blocks will still only be growing slowly) - but not all of them, and almost certainly not *most* of them. And then what do we have? A couple thousand fewer nodes, tops? The network will **still** be distributed over thousands of other nodes, plus the additional nodes that get spun up simply because of increasing adoption and interest, and at the end of the day, the system still functions as - gasp! - a dectralized network, albeit one with slightly higher system requirements to contribute to. What real, **practical** effects will this "increased centralization" have? **None!** Except perhaps a vague feeling of "awww, too bad that fewer folks are running full nodes, now."
Much, much more "real" are the kinds of centralization that would emerge from the limited-blocksize alternative: services like the completely centralized ChangeTip, like CoinBase's internal sends, etc. - **that's** the kind of centralization that I worry about.

To be brutally honest, I think the text needs a lot of work. The impression I get from it is one of criminality, and a distinct alienation - and I'm about as criminal-friendly as they come. I wish I had some concrete suggestions on what to write, but I'm coming up short. Suffice to say I think a bit of an overhaul would be a good move (sorry).
The other thing is the visual design - it's much too busy, and there's no clear path for the eye to follow. The reader is immediately repulsed/overwhelmed and the overall message doesn't come through. The highly-contrasted crimson on white, instead of drawing focus and breaking up the space, just ends up creating visual sinkholes that are either ignored or inescapable (in my opinion) - a more subtle color shift for those areas would probably fix it, or making them boxes instead of bars. I think the arrows and the single pair of hands increases the confusion because they "bridge" the two paradigms which are meant to be very distinct (also, it's not really clear what the arrows are representing). I would use less symmetry (both in position and in font, line, and "region" weight), and find some way to *not* make *everything* feel like a heading. Losing the all-caps would probably help, as would paring down the amount of text overall (or giving it a lot more space, like a real infographic). I'd also use better typefaces, and absolutely abolish all the center-aligned blocks - justify them instead, if you must.
I hope that at least some of this is helpful and doesn't just seem like a jab; I'd like to see this concept succeed!

Some concerns with that approach:
You still need redundancy - after all, what if you find in your annual check that it *isn't* functional? The 3-2-1 rule of "3 copies, on two different types of media, with 1 copy offsite" applies for sure.
But from a security perspective, this also raises concerns. After all, each and every time you go to check on the wallets - especially if you do a test send (as you should) to ensure that your passphrases, etc. are still known - is another opportunity for the coins to be stolen via malware, etc.
None of this is a concern with paper backups. Redundancy is still appropriate, but the benefits otherwise are tremendous. No network security risk, no data degradation risk (at least on timescales &lt;100 years or so), no future compatibility risk (though it might be good to keep digital backups of the relevant wallet's source code in redundant, secure locations - just in case), no time commitment once a year or otherwise, etc.
The fundamental question is, what problems exist with paper backups that you would be trying to avoid? If it's the fact that if someone finds the paper backup, they could steal your coins, simply use a SecurePrint code stored elsewhere, or some other encryption scheme, to secure the paper record. That's the only possible reason I can consider, and it's almost precisely the same with either paper or digital data - and doing it digitally is far more expensive and much less reliable. So, again, what actual problem would you be attempting to solve?

Honestly, I think Bitcoin would benefit greatly from more frequent difficult retargets, anyway. The 2 week mark is entirely arbitrary, and honestly has a lot of potential to cause problems whenever there's a sudden change in hashrate. It could, in fact, be the nail in the coffin of Bitcoin should something only moderately disruptive happen - we could be stuck waiting for months for enough blocks to get solved to retarget, and throughout such a period there would be virtually zero transaction capacity (and of course the horrendous doomsday scenario outlined by Gavin in his post about what happens when blocks are full).

Both of these notions are ones that are totally new to me, and I have been studying "anarcho"-capitalists' beliefs for quite a while, now. Are you sure that they are actually universally accepted in that field? Because much of what I've read suggests otherwise.
Furthermore, even if they were universal tenets, how would such restrictions and legitimizations be decided, and by whom? What constitutes "homesteading?" How would existing property titles be honored (or not honored), and why would anyone from **either** side accept the whichever decision is made on that issue? Polycentric law would be a disastrous solution, as competing courts would simply rule with opposite standards, no? Would these restrictions have to be self-imposed? What incentives would any property "owner" have to adhere to these restrictions? And what about fraudulent, "fine print" type solutions where, perhaps, the "owner" of the only fountain on an island provides a single "public" fountain, but that delivers barely enough water for the rest of the island to survive?


This actually doesn't parse for me, not even basically. Can you explain what you mean a little better?


Indeed, and their primary role is and has always been the enforcement of private property relationships and class discrepancies, with other tasks being either secondary to those or jsut simple smokescreens. Why would a world founded on the enforcement of property rights and economic classes have anything except a much **greater** need for police-like entities, who would be called to act even more than they do in the world we now know? And what of the historical examples of such forces, like the Pinkertons and others, who have left behind some of the most atrocious historical legacies our society has ever known?

From what I've read, BitPay's exchange rate is a bit behind Coinbase's, so it's not actually "free" - they're just skimming off the exchange instead of to your face. Really a bit sneaky, if you ask me.
And since Coinbase doesn't charge on the first $1,000,000 in transactions, if your volume is low, coinbase could end up being a lot "freer" than BitPay's "free."
Note: my info about the differing exchange rates is second hand, and at least a month or two out of date. Folks should verify that I'm not full of crap before accepting this as true.

While those systems are certainly also affected, they are also quite likely to have much more resilience to such a development, because of how easily interchangeable such algorithms are (a simple edit to httpd.conf and they're mitigated). Obviously Heartbleed didn't cause the kind of panic that you describe, and I doubt that many things of this nature would.
In the case of Bitcoin, which has these ciphers' results enshrined for all time in the blockchain and heavily invested in by miners, migration of ciphers following such an attack would be much more difficult, and would likely require a hard fork. The situations, in my opinion, are not comparable.

I'm a [libertarian socialist]( who's relatively pro-bitcoin in the short-medium-term, and I've felt that way for a couple of years. I am an anarchist communist, and opposed to currencies and private property (a distinct thing from private possessions, mind you) in general. I'm probably somewhat similar to where Banksy lies on the spectrum.
With that said, you're right. I view Bitcoin as a significant step up from the status quo, and of course I also seek decentralization wherever practical, and cryptocurrency can probably do a lot to get us there.
I am also wary. I am very skeptical about any notions of "utopian" capitalism for many, many reasons; you could probably read all about them on and elsewhere. I also, frankly, dislike in general the personality types that Bitcoin seems to attract, to say nothing of the ideologies that glom to it. Worry not, dear reader - I'm **surely** not talking about *you*.
But yes, I would love to see The Fed get knocked down a peg, I would love for folks to have simple means to resist war taxes (and other taxes) *en masse*, I would love for folks in the developing world to expand their economic presence, I would love to see strong cryptographic systems become widely adopted, etc. etc.
In anarchist communities like mine, as far as I've seen, opinions are fairly mixed, but many of us are pretty open to it (though of course there aren't many adopters, as is true in any demographic). There have been a few threads on that are basically like, "so, uh, what do folks here think of Bitcoin?" - they're probably worth looking at. And the rad folks I talk to in "real life" about it are pretty genuinely into the idea, though often fairly uninformed about it (like most people).
What I think is much more likely than Banksy hoping to sell their art for mere *income*, would be perhaps to conduct a silent auction for a good cause of some kind. Maybe to help some political prisoners who are unjustly locked up, or perhaps to give every Food Not Bombs chapter in the world some shiny new spatulas. Who knows?
All in all the OP is kind of a silly notion, but hey, if Banksy's out there reading, this idea could sure be a great source of funding for some very needy and very rad causes.

There is no need for decentralized consensus in this market.
If you're really itching to integrate cryptography into this system, all that's needed is for the ticket-issuing party to digitally sign a "pre-ticket" bit of data that the customer has - it could be their name, or the hash of a public key,  or a pre-formatted ticket statement as designed by the ticket-issuing party.
If the cryptographic signature of the ticket data is valid, then the ticket is also valid. No network connection needed, no blockchain, no convoluted transactions and waiting for confirmation times.
I understand that Bitcoin is many people's first introduction to public-key cryptography, but folks should know that there are a great many much simpler systems that have existed for decades that can handle a great many different roles with equal (or greater) security.

I'm talking about *technical* security and privacy. It is very difficult to operate a high-volume account on a major bitcoin exchange without some potentially serious opsec compromises (providing an address or other means to receive fiat withdrawals, etc.), as well as opening oneself up to all types of high-level technical surveillance which can be correlated with other known data and analyses to fill in some very important chunks of information about a targeted individual (or organization).
Darknet vendors, at least the smart ones, go to tremendous lengths to isolate and obfuscate their internet traffic via Tor and I2P, use hardened high-security operating systems like [Tails]( disable all network-based scripts, and in some cases implement techniques to dissuade temporal and even linguistic analysis. Starting to conduct frequent business with a pseudonymous exchange site which could be targeted for a secret subpoena or simple law enforcement hack, an exchange which requires the execution of scripts in a browser, which has on record some amount of information about your operation that is not available in any other place online... is dangerous. And many vendors recognize that.
Sure, I don't doubt that many folks cash out on BTC-E, and I'm sure that many of those take the significant additional operational precautions to make doing so less risky for their own security and privacy - but it's still a distressingly large expansion of their vulnerable *attack surface* (as it's known in the security industry) to their adversaries (primarily governments and law enforcement).
The point is, that all of this is indeed **not** trivial or "easy" for an illicit darknet vendor - at least a smart one - to implement. And that is simply a fact.

I have no investment in Monero, and know very little about it. In this example, it could just as well be substituted with Bytecoin, Darkcoin, Anoncoin (once it implements Zerocoin) or any other integral-privacy cryptocurrency.
In the security world, what seems like an "asteroid" can become as likely as a rainstorm with a single development. By noticing the "long-shot" threat from the start, and taking steps to mitigate, actual future-resilient security is achieved.
You are entitled to believe whatever you'd like to, but I will express my profound gratitude that you do not act in any development capacity for any information security system.

And yet still no actual attention paid to [Key Trust]( one of the single most important aspects of any cryptosystem like this.
This is a completely centralized solution that requires all users to completely, 100% trust the central server to provide accurate keys every time they're requested, with absolutely no means to verify that the key you're encrypting to is actually the one held by the person you're trying to reach. Key substitution attacks are the single easiest and simplest means for adversaries like NSA to decrypt secure, asynchronous communications like these.
Futhermore, since they're going with a totally centralized model from the ground up, why not at least implement some degree of forward secrecy, like [TextSecure's Axolotl ratcheting]( I mean, I'm not trying to be a hater, and I'm always glad to see decent, open-source crypto come about, but Forward Secrecy is a very big deal and a very important feature, especially when keys are being stored on devices as insecure as smartphones.
Honestly, someone should just port [TextSecure]( (which has been shown in the recent Snowden leaks to be "Catastrophic" for NSA collection efforts) to work for email, and that would be a much better step than this (and likely easier). It already has a great interface.
Hopefully we'll begin to see some more ideal solutions to this stuff in the future. Solving the issues of centralization and Key Trust are especially difficult, but good strides are being made (as with the DIME spec, the LEAP project/BitMask, and others).

[Bruce Schneier uses PassSafe]( which he helped develop. It is a local utility and so has a completely different model than LastPass. He has, according to my research, never endorsed LastPass.
Steve Gibson, who I do respect, is more than a bit foolish in his **2010** endorsement of LastPass (so much so that I might suspect a bit of *quid-pro-quo*):


Yeah, except for the very simple way that can be imagined that involves LastPass serving compromised JavaScript to sniff the master password directly. Granted, before these services became "a thing," not many people really thought about that threat. But now they are, and it is indeed a threat, and a very real one. Legal compulsion, hackers, or a malicious operator could - with **ease** - induce LastPass to modify the scripts they serve to completely undermine the security of their system. It's the same exact reason why services like [ProtonMail]( are a terrible idea.
I would bet dollars to donuts that Steve Gibson wouldn't endorse it, now, and that he **certainly** wouldn't endorse it after being shown an article about the dangers of dynamic-script crypto operations like [this one](

@_date: 2015-05-21 13:25:22
I just have to clear this up:


Not exactly. It's actually much more serious than that.
You see, generally the the easiest way for an adversary to compromise the security of a cryptosystem like OpenPGP isn't to crack the cryptography itself, obviously. What's much, much easier is to simply **impersonate** the source of some signatures or messages, by using a keypair that the adversary generated and controls. Anybody (even you!) can open up GPG and create a key pair that claims to be owned by the Electrum developer(s), with their email address and everything. The only difference is will be the key data itself - and the fact that the adversary controls the private key. This can even be done by software automatically, on the fly, as a download is being transmitted over the internet!
So, in this case, if the adversary wanted you to run a compromised version of Electrum, all they have to do is alter the file on the download source to their own, malware version, or otherwise redirect the link to their modified copy. If they can do this (and many of us know how frequently websites can be hacked in such ways, or how simple it is for a VPN, proxy, Tor Exit Node, or even another person using the same WiFi connection as you can alter the website contents you might see), then it's a simple matter of replacing not justr the Electrum download, but **also** the signature and public key that are provided - with ones generated by the adversary, to make the download *appear* legitimate. In such a case, you might download Electrum, try to "verify" the signature, and be prompted that you need the associated public key (with a particular ID or fingerprint). So, you then go back to the website, or fetch the relevant public key from a keyserver, import the key, and then the signature from "Animazing" verifies "perfectly!"
...The only problem is, **that** "Animazing" is actually the NSA - or perhaps a cybercriminal.
This is the classic "Man-In-The-Middle" attack, and it is a very serious problem - and very difficult to solve. It exists in more or less the same form for almost every single kind of communications security in the world, from OpenPGP to HTTPS to TextSecure and so on.
HTTPS "solves" it by having Certificate Authorities that attest to which keys are actually legitimate for certain websites, though this relies on the CAs being trustworthy and immune to hacking. OpenPGP systems, on the other hand, decentralize this process, and use the [Web of Trust]( This can be much better for security, but counts on the users to do a great deal more in order to achieve that security, like sign each other's GPG keys, and even participate in some [keysigning parties]( (which can be a lot of fun!).
However, some assurances can be gained by comparing the Fingerprint of a provided public key from multiple sources and over multiple media. For instance, here is a signed statement of the fingerprints that **I** have for ThomasV and Animazing's keys:

...But who am I, and what's to say that **I'm** not working with compromised keys? The only way to know for sure is the Web of Trust. A little help can be had by cross-checking my own public key, which although not a part of the WoT (it's hard for a private cypherpunk to thoroughly authenticate an online pseudonym!), [has been posted on reddit]( and is also available on [Keybase]( So now, our adversary would have to not only intercept the key you get from the Electrum site, but also what you might see on the HTTPS reddit and KeyBase sites - a significantly more difficult task (though not impossible!). This is still not nearly as good as a direct WoT link from you to ThomasV and Animazing, but it is probably good enough for most people's purposes.
TL;DR: Please learn about the importance of [Key Trust]( and understand that those warnings that GPG gives you are much more serious than whether or not the signer is trustworthy or not - it might be a man in the middle!
**EDIT:** Once you have sufficient confidence that a given public key (like Animazing's) in your keyring is "trusted" to you, you may Sign that key Locally with your own GPG key, to avoid being warned about it in the future, and to help ensure that it will not be substituted on your own device at a later date. On the command line, this is done like:  
`gpg --lsign -u YourEmailAddress Animazing`
Where `--lsign` signifies a **L**ocal **Sign**ing operation, that is, one that won't be shared with anyone else or uploaded to any Keyservers. This is your own "vouch" for the authenticity of that key, and that it does in fact belong to who it claims to belong to.
This process is also possible through GUI programs, like Seahorse, Kleopatra, Enigmail, GPA, GPGTools, etc.

Okay, so I actually just legitimately listened to that whole show, and it is a very crafty piece of propaganda that is atrociously off the mark. Let me explain why:
1. Mr. Klein completely distorts the issue as being about **end users** paying more for internet service without net neutrality (which they would), but the much more significant point for net neutrality is that **content providers** (like Netflix, like reddit, like *any* internet content hub) would have to pay ISPs to deliver their content. This is a **disaster** for any kind of startup or non-profit internet destination, as it dramatically raises the barriers to entry for any except the biggest players.
2. On a similar note, Klein goes on to say that under Net Neutrality, entrepreneurs will have fewer incentives for innovation. To me, this is such a bold-faced distortion as to be sickening. Just the opposite is true - if an entrepreneur needs millions of dollars (to essentially bribe ISPs) just to have their service run properly for their customers, then the barriers to innovation are greatly *increased*, not decreased. More Venture Capital must be raised - and risked - and startups will have less money available for actually developing their product. In addition, these kinds of conditions would rob us of so much of what makes the internet great - imagine a web where little treasures like  or  or even  would never be able to get started with a real online presence, because they were created with basically no budget and therefore would become practically unusable as soon as the word got out about them (and possibly before that).
3. Even more disingenuously, Klein then goes on a whole tirade of plain and simple FUD about government regulating and censoring content, which is an outright red herring and has very little to do with net neutrality. This notion is a neoconservative bogeyman, and a plainly artifical one. Besides, net neutrality is not a pre-requisite for States to begin censoring internet content - many nations (like China, Turkey, and others) are already censoring internet content freely - on our existing, neutral internet! If you honestly believe that the U.S. government would, for who knows what possible reason, require some entirely symbolic piece of legislation to exist before making the reckless and provocative move of censoring the internet, then I've got a bridge to sell you. I suppose Mr. Klein would also argue that the NSA would have never started its enormous wiretapping programs if the USA PATRIOT Act had never been passed? I mean, come on.
4. Klein later asserts that ISPs are *not* in fact a natural monopoly, even though they very clearly are (a textbook example, even), and perhaps continues his argument to say that natural monopolies can't even really exist!? Putting aside that preposterous, second assertion, his arguments as to why ISPs have something resembling healthy competition are "alternatives" to in-home over-the-wire service like 4G, satellite ISPs, and public wifi from Starbucks (!), literally. I mean, that has to be a joke, right? Anyone who has used any of those services knows, without hesitation, that they are not even *reasonably* comparable to To-The-Premises broadband service of almost any kind - to say they are mischaracterizes the market for internet service as being way, **way** more elastic than any reasonable customer would ever describe it as. Besides - these aren't even actual "alternative" options in the context of Net Neutrality, because it's virtually guaranteed that they would have the same policies of greatly reducing the bandwidth available for those content providers that can't pay the "protection" fee - yes, a non-neutral net is almost perfectly parallel to a mafia-style protection racket!
All in all, that show does a fine job of *sounding* authoritative and informed, but it **fundamentally** mischaracterizes the issue, makes unfounded assumptions, uses absolutely terrible examples to support its arguments, and fits squarely into the ever-swelling sea of outright propaganda in support of those who are already entrenched, wealthy, and powerful - and not - not **nearly** - any kind of innovators, entrepreneurs, and or any beneficial services that might not be interested in turning a profit.

I believe you meant to link this URL: 
Also, there are numerous, very serious flaws both in the paper itself and the idea, as far as I can tell (without yet having read it all).
1. I fail to see the point of using a QR code as a message format within an image - the image already must be transmitted digitally, so why wouldn't the plaintext payload just be directly hidden in the steg'd image data? This idea completely bypasses the entire point of QR codes, which is to be machine-readable from analog media. The transmission must already be digital (and of significant resources, if you're serious about recommending .bmp as the container format), so I fail to see literally any point whatsoever in bringing QR Codes into the mix. Not to mention that the QR Code format is proprietary...
2. Why are you using such weird ciphering schemes? And why are you rolling your own crypto at all? Symmetric crypto is quite mature - why not just use an already well-reviewed and highly secure library for a well-reviewed system, like AES, Salsa20, TwoFish, etc.? The very first and most important rule of coding crypto is **DON'T ROLL YOUR OWN CRYPTO**, and that's for very good reason.
3. A vernam cipher? Seriously? Have we learned nothing from the RC4 break? Where is your keystream coming from? Can you trust your CSPRNG? Do you even make use of one?
4. Your cryptanalysis is hardly worthy of the name, and is not a reflection of your actual threat model. If you are not a cryptographer or cryptologist, I wouldn't bother trying to do your own cryptanalysis - although if you were using an actually secure cryptosystem like those named above, you wouldn't need to, anyway. Your cipher choice and demonstrated attacks appear to be literally decades out of date.
5. The "password" functionality seems to be completely pointless - all it does is allow your own software to... parse the LSBs from the image. And it's not even stored in the image with a KDF or anything, not that it would matter... What is the intended purpose of this "steganography password?" Note that your attackers will simply modify your code or write their own to ignore this "password" functionality - and it will not be difficult to do, even for an extremely novice programmer.
6. I see no mention of Message Authentication Codes anywhere in your system. This is a mistake. Also, be sure to use Encrypt-Then-MAC ("ETM") as other schemes have demonstrated weaknesses in recent years.
7. There are numerous, glaring spelling, tense and grammatical mistakes throughout the paper, which are forgivable to an extent, but are definitely not helping you, here.
8. Your paper offers no comparisons to existing image steg systems, like OutGuess, StegHide, whatever that new one that Bram Cohen is working on is, etc. Why not? I would say that such comparisons would be an essential part of a paper like this.
9. A system reliant on BMP images in 2016 completely defeats the purpose of steganography, as such images stand out like a sore thumb (and are difficult to transport, besides) in the age of GIF, JPEG and PNG.
Your intentions and efforts are exceptional, and I'm very glad that you're working in the field. But I think you may need to get a better handle on how things are done before diving in and publishing your own papers like this. This is a solid effort and a noble project, though, and I look forward to seeing whatever you come up with, next!

I'm sorry, but you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Oil production in Saudi Arabia has been explicitly separated from the royals for a long time. Production in numerous other middle eastern nations has been privatized as well.
Also, in some oil-rich nations, there are in fact dividends paid to the general population, at least for natural-born citizens who meet certain criteria.
Your arguments about the language barrier make no sense, as there are obviously many other regions that share this difficulty, yet have transcended it.
And to say that there's "no need" for it in the Arab world is just baffling. Why would there be any less need than anywhere else? In fact, with usury being Haram in traditional Islamic culture, if anything, the need for Bitcoin is much greater - Muslim people and businesses deal with huge quantities of cash *constantly* for this reason.

And the EFF doesn't exactly endorse anything about their *actual* security - just about their policies (which are nice, and all, but are not really my priority).
Seriously, why would you use Wickr when you can use TextSecure and RedPhone? What reason could there possibly be? It's simply an inferior product, with extremely uncertain security, that has literally zero features that TextSecure and RedPhone do not. Meanwhile, TextSecure and RedPhone are developed by seasoned cryptographers, strictly in the public interest, with completely open development and code that can be (and has been!) audited. They have also been given the ringing endorsement of the NSA which classified them as "Extremely Difficult" to compromise.
I understand that you may be a fan of Wickr, but in all honesty, it's a bit like choosing to use a lunchbox to store your valuables when somebody is giving away bank vaults for free.

Fortunately for all of us, that isn't how technological progress works. For hundreds of thousands of years, our ancestors (who were just as intelligent as we are today) never learned to harness and maintain fire to cook their meals, which has a reward of enormously increased caloric value and nutrition for a given amount of food. One day, a person spent some time playing with fire on the edges of a lightning-struck, burning forest, and tried cooking something with it (a discovery which was probably repeated many, many times in different regions), and considered it good. But it took literally thousands of generations before the circumstances were aligned to make that person learn that (and then, to spread the cooking meme far and wide).
Crypto breakthroughs can be quite like that.

I encourage you to examine the history of already-broken hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, and broken ciphers like RC4. Each of those spent many years enjoying the same kind of security guarantees as SHA-2, until the day that they didn't. I'm also curious why, if you really believe what you're saying, the NSA and NIST have already hosted a competition to standardize SHA-3 (with the Keccak hash function as the selection) if the SHA-2 family was really faultless.

The only thing that you don't include in your analysis, though, is the very real truth that Bitcoin is potentially catastrophically vulnerable in ways that traditional currencies are not. Specifically, I'm thinking of a sudden (and perhaps unpublished) cryptographic breakthrough that would allow an adversary to forge ECDSA signatures, and spend coins that they don't actually own, or potentially, a partial or complete break of SHA256 which might allow an adversary to fork the blockchain in a catastrophic way.
While such an event wouldn't be the absolute *end* of Bitcoin - the devs would update the ciphers/functions used to non-vulnerable ones, and so on - it would be an enormous blow to its functionality for a time, and certainly to its credibility (and therefore valuation) overall, likely forever. Furthermore, undoing the damage of such an attack might be particularly difficult if the adversary is especially smart, and executes their attack slowly, over a period of time. Since the way to "repair" an attack like this would be to essentially "roll back" the blockchain to the most recent point before the attack began, if the adversary merely steals coins from certain wealthy addresses here and there, piecemeal and undetected, then there may not be a good time to "roll back" to without eliminating potentially weeks or even months of transaction history.
Such a scenario is the one major thing that makes me hesitant about serious investment in Bitcoin.

It's very good, you clearly have a good mind for education, as far as anticipating the needs and knowledge gaps of your audience. That's honestly something that the vast majority of people aren't nearly as good at, and you should be proud of that.
With that said, I do have some critique:
* I think the "buy a portion" analogy with the wine and the small-print table just confuses things unnecessarily. I would simplify that. Ditch the table, and maybe just have a big thing saying "you can buy as little as 0.000001 bitcoin at a time" or similar. Perhaps some kind of analogy would be good, but it should be simpler (no need for a "middle-size" portion to be shown, and no table), and probably something more fluid, and without the confusion of wholesale/retail that a bottle of wine vs. a glass of wine entails - maybe gas from a gas station. "Yes, gas costs $3.50/gallon, but you can buy any portion of a gallon."
* Trim the fat. There's a lot here that can wait 'til another time - any discussion of trading/exchanges, mining, etc. And then it may make sense to question if your audience actually has any interest in holding/spending/saving bitcoin, or if they just want to use it to post their ad and be done with it (I suspect this is the case for a large majority). If the latter, it would probably make sense to eliminate all the stuff about savings, paper wallets, and spending bitcoin (although perhaps a VERY brief overview, like the splash of logos of where it can be spent, even indirectly, would be good). And perhaps a Q&amp;A break at some point to find out if the audience does or does not have an interest in holding/saving/spending, at which point brief mention of these things could happen.
* On the subject of that "splash of logos" slide that talks about gift cards apps, the heading is very confusing - it's titled "Proxy Apps! (Android only)", but the pictures shown are not proxy apps, and the audience has no idea what a proxy app is (probably - I didn't, until I thought about it for a bit). Rather I would head that slide with something like, "spend BTC at all these and more with simple gift card apps!"
* On a more superficial level, I think the theme for the slides is a little weak. The way the whitespace in the heading area is cut off on the top of the screen, out of balance with the closed box for the main content on each slide, just looks "weird" and isn't good design. I might experiment with any or all of: closing the top of the heading box to match the bottom of the slide, using a different alignment on the heading text (center or right), using a larger and/or heavier and/or different typeface for the heading text to better fill the heading area and/or distinguish it from the content better, making the divider between heading and content less drastic (a less contrasting color? replace it with a simple underline, perhaps? It's a classic for a reason...), and so on. There's lots of ways to play with it, but of course I wouldn't go nuts trying to get it perfect. As it is now, every slide just looks like a big "H" and it's distracting and ineffective, from a design perspective.
* I second the notion already raised about mentioning malware - I think it's a very significant threat that deserves some attention. But again, keep things brief however you can. Malware is a good reason to keep bitcoin on a phone (unfortunately).
* You say (or imply) that bitcoin sent by a john to a phone is one-way and cannot be stolen back, but that's not really true unless it's a watching-only wallet. I would probably clarify that phone wallets use a PIN code just like a bank debit card/ATM, and then MAYBE mention watching-only wallets. But again, you're struggling against excess info, here, and that might not make the cut.

If you want a 2-way machine (allows buying *and* selling), though, some verification is necessary in the U.S., to comply with regulations (I think). But there are still some machines that may be better about this than others, and/or some that will still put up no hurdles for folks who just want to buy coins.

I had the same thought, but last week corrected me and said that yes, even multiple receipts to a single address without spending from it are still a problem, although I'm still a bit confused about why that is. What I got from it is basically that to spend more than one of the inputs to an address, a separate signature must be used for each input, therefore revealing more signatures even for a single "spend."

That is a summary of a potential attack on one, single aspect of the cryptosystem. While such discussions are useful, they do little to provide any assurance that the system as a whole is secure. For instance, since Telegram doesn't implement any kind of persistent key authentication for users, a much simpler attack can be achieved by simple impersonation and key substitution, at virtually zero expense.
The alternatives I mentioned, on the other hand, such as TextSecure, actually allow key trust to be established between users properly, through out-of-band channels like a phone call (perhaps itself secured by RedPhone).
This is just one problem out of many with Telegram's approach to security, and the restrictive conditions of their "contest" are nothing more than an insult to their users' intellects.
It is, in general, a very good idea to avoid cryptosystems with overinflated hubris, which tend to consistently over-promise and under-deliver. Telegram fits that category perfectly, and the fact that they are intentionally deceptive/manipulative to do it really seals the deal. Their product(s) should be avoided.

@_date: 2015-07-27 18:56:23
Perhaps I wasn't very clear in my explanation. A key substitution attack against Telegram costs virtually nothing and requires almost no time or effort, and is completely effective at revealing Telegram plaintexts. That is just one example of an attack that Telegram's design offers few defenses against.
What you are arguing is similar to saying "this secure facility is impenetrable! The walls are made of 36-inch steel-reinforced concrete! It would cost millions of dollars to breach those walls!" while completely ignoring the fact that the front gate is left completely open and unguarded during parts of the day, allowing anyone to walk in unhindered.
It is certainly good that Telegram's Diffie-Hellman implementation is secure (though not exactly noteworthy), but that implementation is only a single aspect of a larger system, and any secure system is (generally) only as secure as its weakest component. In this case, there are a number of other components of Telegram that allow for much less expensive attacks.
And even if there *weren't*, the fact remains that their crypto code is **still closed-source and secret!** That in itself is an **enormous** problem. I thought the days of people defending closed-source crypto would finally have died with Edward Snowden's revelations, but I am apparently incorrect.
While the extensions and apps built on top of Telegram are certainly useful, my critique of the platform arises specifically *because* it is touted as "ultra-secure" when it is in fact *not*. If they simply marketed it as an extensible messenger application, without such an emphasis on its "security," I would have no qualms with it - in fact, I would probably give it my full support! However, Telegram's marketing is very explicit about its "security," when in fact there are numerous demonstrated flaws with their cryptography and security model in general. And because they make those claims, they deserve to be held to account for them - and they are found wanting.
With an unlimited budget, it is true that some attacks may be feasible against TextSecure, but at the moment, **none** of those attacks are significantly more practical than a simple brute-force of the total keyspace. **That** is what a properly designed and implemented cryptosystem achieves, and what Telegram most certainly does not. The difference is an important one.
I am honestly baffled by your insistence at defending, as if it is your own child, this poorly-designed, partially-closed source, dishonest and deceptively marketed app for which superior alternatives are available (at least for the communications components, with other features like bitcoin purchasing available through additional, supplemental apps). My critiques of Telegram are not critiques of *you*, nor does your use of Telegram somehow make you a bad person or stupid - merely an uninformed one, which I am attempting to correct. I'm sure you're a nice enough person and so I am trying to help you (and others here) make more informed decisions about the ways that you secure your communications. That's my only goal, here. You are, of course, welcome to ignore the information that I'm offering, but you do so at your own expense, and in doing so you may very well cross the threshhold between merely uninformed and downright obstinant, or even foolish.

This article doesn't even get to the *really* juicy possibilities, and the *real* reasons why something like this would *actually* work.
The reasons why this thing could work so well is because it lets insiders, with secret or otherwise rare but important information, win their "bets" by *sharing* that information - without actually sharing it. It creates a direct and straightforward economic incentive *against secrecy*. Those with **really** good inside info would be able to lay down a big wager, strongly shift the odds of the market in a noticeable way, and in so doing "spill the beans" without putting themselves at risk - and they'd be compensated handsomely for it (in theory).
The other really interesting aspect is when you get into what David Chaum was talking about twenty-five years ago... which I won't elaborate on, here. On a smaller scale, though, similar things could incentivize some interesting actions - one could wager, for instance, that Earth First! will successfully shut down the operation of a gas fracking well for 12 hours or more before such-and-such date - and the participants of that action could put a wager on the line that not only gives them a stake and incentive to actually carry it out, but actually *rewards* them for following through with it. Those who agree with such an action could put in their own wager on the opposite side - and provide direct economic support to the folks on the front lines, without even needing to know them.
It's really pretty exciting stuff - and that's saying something, coming from a vehement anti-capitalist like me. The biggest problem, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, is the liquidity - without others to balance the bets, the incentives for these most important and most interesting applications break down.
So the moral of the story is, **start using Augur, folks, and tell your friends**.
EDIT: My one biggest concern is the privacy and/or pseudonymity of the system. For it to work well, and actually accomplish the *really* neat stuff, it needs to be completely open to the most "paranoid" of private users, and take that privacy seriously. Otherwise, the only inputs to the system will be from those parties with nothing to lose by tipping their hand - and they are the ones with the *least* truth to offer. I haven't read up on this aspect of Augur, but ideally it should have full, hassle-free support for mixnets like Tor and/or I2P, and not require any kind of verifiable personal identity other than what its pseudonymous users choose to offer (in practice, probably no more than a single asymmetric keypair). So my one big question is, "does Augur **seriously** respect its users' privacy?"

I love how misogynists are always so quick to jump to absurd strawman arguments - it either shows that they're incredibly dishonest or incredibly ignorant about the other side's ideas (and the latter, I would wager, is more a result of a lack of listening and honest consideration than anything else).
No, I'm not advocating for 50/50 representation, and no, I'm not saying that a gender imbalance nullifies any other achievements.
What is so problematic in your comment above is that presumes that the *status quo* of gender imbalance and gendered skills is somehow a natural function of biology, when to any reasonable observer, the effects of culture and historical inertia are absolutely staggering. Even if you discount the amount that "nurture" is responsible for the way things are, to even entertain speculations that are demeaning and oppressive, to both men **and** women, as if it were even *possible* to have any kind of confidence of an answer, and in a context that is clearly *not* actually "innocent speculation," but opinion, is itself a factor in ongoing oppressive dynamics.

One aspect that I haven't seen mentioned here is the risk of SPV/"light" wallets associating different addresses together. Any wallet that doesn't require the user to host their own, full copy of the 25GB+ blockchain will reveal all of their bitcoin addresses to whatever server their wallet queries for their balances. This is part of what makes these wallets so dangerous to use for activities that the State may not approve of, but unfortunately, downloading the entire blockchain through Tor or other anonymizing tools is not really feasible. So, the best compromise is usually to use a light wallet that has always and forever **only** been used anonymously, like creating a wallet with the Electrum software that's included in [Tails]( which is pre-configured to only ever exist through Tor. But the individual addresses in that wallet will still be "linked" to one another.
This only becomes an issue if your adversary can run, subpoena, get a warrant for, hack, or sniff the unencrypted traffic of one or more of the servers that these wallets connect to. But they almost certainly can do one of those things.

It seems like many, many people aren't aware of the scope and difficulty of the Key Trust problem - I'm glad that you're here to set things straight.
I just want to add some potential solutions and mitigations -
1. [The OpenPGP Web of Trust]( if properly implemented and integrated, is probably the most secure and tested method we have at the moment. Downside: virtually nobody has it properly implemented and integrated, or uses it virtually at all.
2.  can allow some "cross-trust" references between different online accoutns, like how I have a Bitcoin address and GPG key listed under  - this still places trust in KeyBase (and one's connection to it) to be free of malice, but it's almost certainly sufficient for this use case.
3. Next-generation, blockchain-based identity systems like BitAlias, BlockStore and DNSChain - or potentially even Namecoin, despite its first-generation issues - could be the real "killer app" that finally solve this issue, but they are still not really used yet and are likely to continue to evolve. Folks should set them up and begin using them though, to build a network effect, as the potential benefits are enormous...

Telegram secret chat is indeed implemented in the client, but the actual crypto code is **not** open-source. They have thankfully at least released (some) technical documentation of their crypto (which has a number of flaws and oddities, as my links above point out), but the code itself may be something completely different.
The problem is made **doubly** infuriating because much of Telegram's *other* code is open source, and they bill the app as a whole as "open source," but it simply isn't true. The very most important parts of the core code are still secret (although they claim to have plans to open it all, eventually).

In addition to the points already raised, one nice advantage of running Bitcoin Core (or other "full node" wallets) is that they offer increased privacy. That's because with a "light" wallet like Electrum, Mycelium, etc. (any wallet that doesn't download the enormous blockchain data), the wallet has to communicate with a server outside of your control, over the internet, to enquire about the balances on all of your bitcoin addresses. The result is that whatever server(s) your wallet connects to in this way immediately know(s) that all of your wallet's addresses are associated with one another and controlled by the same person.
For many people, that's not an issue, but it *is* a compromise on privacy that using a "full node" wallet does not create.

That isn't true at all. Look at the Autonomista movement of Argentina of the last fifteen years - the excellent documentary [*The Take*]( (full stream at that link) documents them well.
Squatters' movements have also been reclaiming the commons without state or bank intervention for as long as there has been such a thing as private property.
Those movements, and many others, not only effectively redistribute property, but do so directly in defiance of the State, and are often quite violently opposed by it.
But here's the real kicker: socialism doesn't even prescribe "forcible wealth redistribution" - that's a strawman. Seriously. Sure, a number of Leninist states pursued such a goal, but Leninists today are a very small minority of socialists - there are many more [anarchists]( than Marxists pretty much anywhere on the planet, and we get a great deal more done than Marxists do, besides.
Now, that's not to say that there aren't many anarchists in favor of reclaiming the commons by whatever means are necessary and just for people's survival (I happen to be one of them), but to say that this is a "socialist" tenet is false on its face, and further, it absolutely does *not* require any kind of central banking.
**Socialism is literally nothing more than workers being the owners of their workplaces.** Period. That's it. That's the actual, technical definition of socialism, and it's the one that nearly all anarchists (who, as already mentioned, constitute a sizable majority of socialists worldwide) use the term. It's also how qualified political scientists define it.
So what you're thinking of is Leninism, sometimes also called or "lumped in" as "MLM" (Marxist-Leninist-Maoism), "Marxism," "State socialism," "Authoritarian socialism," or "State capitalism," this last being the term preferred by scholars like Noam Chomsky and many other anarchists. And those types are, frankly, basically irrelevant in any kind of politics today, except in a few peculiar nations where they have organized vigorously over decades, with some solid momentum from the old Maoist bloc.
It is almost undeniable that if there is anything "socialist" about the crew behind Mr. Robot, they are quite assuredly in the Libertarian wing of the idea.
So, with that out of the way, let me further contribute why I, as a socialist, also embrace Bitcoin, to quote a comment of mine originally written [here](
I'm pretty in favor of it in the short- and medium-term, but I'm also quite wary. I think it's a great way for people to stop paying war taxes (and other taxes) and to dismantle the power of banks, etc. It's also extremely useful for fundraising for radical causes - let's say you want to donate money online to Rojava, or the Chicago bail fund, or whoever - if you use a credit card, paypal, etc., there's a clear paper trail linking your legal identity to your support of those causes, which is potentially problematic. Donating with Bitcoin, it's a lot more like just sticking cash in a hat - much, much more private. This benefit also extends to other situations, as well - in a hypothetical, actual revolution-type scenario, a system for moving resources around that cannot be interrupted or censored has obvious applications. There are still privacy concerns with Bitcoin, though, and using it with strong privacy is still somewhat tricky, but at least it doesn't yield a direct line to personal data with every transaction. And improved privacy (often referred to as "fungibility" in the Bitcoin community) is squarely on the roadmap for the future, and seems pretty solvable.
I also moderate and I believe that the darknet drug trade has done a ton of good towards harm reduction in the drug-using community. DNM drugs are by and large purer, safer, more accurately dosed, and so on, and when they aren't, there's *infinitely* more accountability of the vendors than in the "conventional" drug trade. There are organized efforts for publicized purity tests (even crowdfunded subsidies for testing samples from people who can't afford it themselves), scandals surrounding dangerous cuts that emerge, as well as access to lifesaving resources like Naloxone (Narcan) through the same channels as the drugs themselves. As a medic and public health advocate, I see all of this as a huge step forward.
The last thing that excites my about cryptocurrencies is that it's a great entry point for introducing and adopting other important cryptographic systems and methods. I earnestly believe that widespread understanding and adoption of strong cryptographic tools for communications, security, and anonymity have enormous potential to subvert the current global order, especially as technology becomes more and more integrated into our lives. The Bitcoin community is **filled** to the brim with people who never in a million years would have otherwise used [Tor]( [I2P]( [GPG]( and other security and privacy technologies, and because of the network effect, with every person who starts learning about and using those tools, they become even more useful. In that way, Bitcoin might one day be indirectly responsible for killing Facebook (and replacing it with [something better]( based on strong cryptography and privacy controls), for thwarting mass surveillance, and for facilitating the crypto-anarchist/cypherpunk vision for the future (which is largely tainted by ancapism, but there is also a significant leftist presence in that field, as well). To all my comrades here, I strongly encourage you to start learning about cryptographic and anonymity software - it is one of the best tools in our kit for liberation!
**I have a lot of critiques of Bitcoin, too, though**: for one thing, obviously, currency itself is a problematic thing. Hence the "short- and medium-term" qualifier above. It still allows the hoarding of resources away from the commons, and the subversion of the consent of workers and others, as well as being a means to facilitate hired oppressive forces. Of course, this is true of any currency, not just cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
For another, the Bitcoin community itself is quite toxic. Rampant misogyny, out-and-out privilege-blindness, Just World Hypothesis bullshit, patronizing and racist "charity" and "benevolent globalization" ideals, and just old-fashioned insecurity and bad-faith arguments in defense of fragile egos are everywhere in Bitcoin-related communities online, which I believe are a reflection of the extremely privileged demographics that are its mainstay.
Additionally, even Bitcoin's *best case* endgame may largely just end up being a shift of the power balance into something equally oppressive - from the current dominant ruling class of old imperial hegemony to a hegemony of privileged nerds who are largely clueless about pressing social issues and the world. While pulling the rug out from under 10,000 years of accumulated power certainly sounds fun (and I'd love to see it, regardless, if only because it would be fascinating), as we anarchists are very well aware, it matters little *who* holds the power - it is the holding of power itself that is problematic.
Then there's the oft-cited environmental impact of mining, or even just the baseline resources expended just to run the non-mining computer network. For me personally, I actually believe that this problem is overstated - it's easy to overlook the very real environmental impact of conventional money systems, which rely on the construction, furnishing, and utility consumption of enormous office complexes, an entire physical security infrastructure (including the production and operation of armored vehicles, vaults, and so on), and of course the incalculable but overwhelming impact of middlemen and other inefficiencies that employ millions of people towards what are essentially redundant and unnecessary ends - lawyers, bankers, accountants, escrow agents, fund managers, and so on, which cryptocurrency technologies have the potential to greatly reduce (and in some cases even eliminate). The resources expended to accommodate such inefficiencies are enormous and impossible to survey completely. Funny - I feel pretty gross talking about "inefficiencies" like this... feels a bit too much like ancapery to my sensitive and thoroughly communist brain. But it's true. Anyway, so while "well this *other* way isn't any better" is a really frustrating and stupid argument, it is in this case at least appropriate, and my best estimate is that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency is probably approximately a wash, on this front, or possibly a modest net improvement.
All in all, I'm excited by cryptocurrencies, and I really think more folks from our movement should get on board. The community issues I mention above are (partially...) solvable by changing the constituents of that community, and this is a technology that has a lot of benefits for us, if we manage not to be too turned off by its shortcomings. There is also, of course, the small but not dismissible chance that cryptocurrencies could really take off in a big way, and largely supplant traditional money, in which case it would behoove us to not be left in the dust as the new global underclass, and claim a significant share of those resources while we still feasibly can.

Definitely an issue, but there's great news on that front. Recent versions of the [Vuze BitTorrent client]( have an integrated but optional I2P plugin which has been somewhat popular, so Vuze peers set up to use the I2P network AND the clearnet provide a "bridge" into the I2P network for many popular clearnet torrents, via the DHT. You can just take an infohash from any torrent you find and drop it into I2PSnark, and if there's some Vuze peers acting in this way, you'll get it (but slowly, usually).

I think you missed the point that was making. The exchanges aren't actually transacting bitcoin - they're transacting internal IOUs that they manage, create and control themselves. The only time that actual bitcoin or the blockchain come into play is when users deposit or withdraw their holdings on the exchange. The exchange operators themselves can naked short as much as they'd like, quite similarly to how the Willy bot was (probably) performing "naked" transactions on Mt. Gox.

Why not just use the already-existing anonymous BitTorrent that's integrated into [I2P]( I2P is like Tor but is almost completely decentralized and self-scaling, and has numerous features that Tor does not (support for UDP traffic, customizable and more obfuscated tunnels, integrated anonymous email and secure messaging with I2P-Bote, a highly resilient distributed data store with the Tahoe-LAFS plugin, and more).

Research the alternatives before you start. Some have been mentioned here already. I would say that your efforts would go a lot further in helping out one of these existing projects:
* Ricochet
* SubSpace
* LookingGlass
* Bitmessage
* TextSecure (mostly for the Axolotl model)
* I2P-Bote
* Tox
* POND
* DIME
* Crypto.cat
* and more
Don't feel bad, though - this is important software, and your help is desperately needed! Most of the programs I've listed are still in Alpha - your help would go a long way.
One last note: do NOT disregard the importance of [Key Trust]( - you either need a way for participants to compare key fingerprints OR use a pre-shared secret with Socialist Millionaire's Protocol (a la Off-The-Record) OR to make people's "usernames" their fingerprints (like how a Tor .onion site address is a truncated hash of its key fingerprint - some of the above systems do this). Honestly, these days I think the latter option is our only hope, because users almost never verify their keys.
EDIT: Oh, how could I forget about [BlockStore]( (and things like it), which is another way to potentially solve the key trust problem. Honestly, getting that system integrated with secure messaging and email platforms would be an enormous achievement, and very important. It would allow people to avoid being Man-In-The-Middle'd without the need for 3rd party trust.

I think that that is a fair price, assuming they do a good job (which I imagine they do). A VPS with sufficient specs would probably be around $15/month, but you have to place a reasonable value on your time, as well - and with your (apparent) knowledge base, I would suspect that there would be many, many hours of your time involved, particularly starting up, but also in monthly maintenance.
The easiest way for a non-technical person to run their own relay would probably be with a fully pre-configured OS image, like [Tor-ramdisk]( but it is a somewhat small project and its continuity of updates, etc. is not guaranteed. It may even be out of date right now. And of course, even with such an image, there's likely to be unanticipated snags in getting it set up.
So, the question is really, "do I feel like pulling my hair out for many hours learning about GNU/Linux and maybe having nothing (decent) to show for it, or would I just rather have it done properly by someone else and not have to worry about it?"

This is what's known on the [Darknet Markets](as an "exit scam."

They're extremely similar. The three major differences as far as I can tell are:
* OKTurtles (DNSChain) focuses their marketing on website identities, while BlockStore's written focus is more general, including individual users who just want to communicate securely. Note that this is a superficial difference - both can be used for both;
* BlockStore uses the security of the one and only Bitcoin blockchain; DNSChain uses the much weaker NameCoin blockchain (for now);
* BlockStore has an integrated DHT infohash distribution mechanism, meaning that it can be used to securely deliver *any* authenticated data of any size, without bloating any blockchain - not just small, cryptographic keys.
Note that I am not an expert on either of these technologies, and frankly, both of them could benefit greatly from increased documentation. But from what I've read of each, the above are the major differences that I have found.
I am personally a bit partial to the BlockStore design, but if **either** one succeeds it will be a tremendous victory for how information moves across networks, and I support them both.

@_date: 2015-09-08 02:13:11
No, it wouldn't. Any time you work with any cryptographic software (Bitcoin, Tor, I2P, GPG, LUKS, TrueCrypt... any of it), full encryption/decryption keys get stored in memory, and in many cases kept there, sometimes indefinitely. Memory is assumed to be secure storage. If it wasn't, none of these tools would be usable.
Sure, there's some (small) advantage to purging secrets from memory when they're no longer relevant, but if your adversary is able to read arbitrary sections of your system's memory, you've really got much, much bigger problems.

I don't tack any heavy claims on the significance of the date. It could be arbitrary, or it could be a wink and a nod to the FDR decree as suggested, and I don't believe strongly either way. It pays to mention, though, that as someone who uses strongly anonymous pseudonyms online regularly, and has for more than 10 years, I can speak to the fact that using clever references like this among bits of "personal" information is a very understandable and common practice.
The evidence for Satoshi being a crypto-anarchist is pretty conclusive, in my opinion - with the most significant piece of evidence being the simple fact that they were *deeply aware* of the quest for digital cash and a *part* of the community seeking it. In 2007, that history simply didn't really appeal to anyone in a major way *except* for those who sought to subvert the dominant economic powers of the time. I know, because I was (and am) one of those people. David Chaum wrote the original cryptocurrency paper in **1982**, and conceived a cryptocurrency-driven assassination market not long after - while all the while (up to 2010 or so) the discussion around the implications of these ideas were discussed almost exclusively by a distinctly "eccentric" community. How could they not be?
The "scene" of folks interested and involved in these kinds of systems was overwhelmingly dominated by pseudonymous entities with a distinctly anti-establishment bent, most of them of the "anarcho"-capitalist variety (which is an ideology that disgusts me, personally, and of course is very popular among Bitcoiners - solidarity to you, my fellow socialist!). It was only with the advent of Bitcoin's surge in popularity that folks *without* that kind of background even began to learn about these projects' aims and existence.
I just find it difficult to believe that an outsider, completely at odds with the overwhelming beliefs of the cypherpunk community (whether capitalist **or** socialist), would somehow become well-versed in that community's existing efforts and related projects up to that date (like HashCash, Digital Monetary Trust, e-Gold, etc.) and then proceed to spend an enormous amount of time actually *working* on such a system without some kind of similar ideological motivation.
But in any case, I don't particularly care either way. If it *is* an arbitrary date, or if it is Satoshi's actual birthday, that's no disappointment to me.

This is a strawman argument, though - miners and relaying nodes still have 100% discretion on which txs are relayed or included in a block, and in fact the options to do that are already included in all the relevant software. Nobody (literally nobody) is making an argument that the network should be completely, entirely unfettered. There are many, many ways to rein in actual exploitation of the network like you describe, even without a block size limit. If anything, trying to do it with MAX_BLOCKSIZE is an extremely crude and blunt instrument, when much more precise and economically effective alternatives exist.

Note that using an exchange as a coin mixer in this way has the same shortcomings as any centralized mixing service like [Helix by Grams]( (Tor-only .onion link) - the service itself has full knowledge of the connection between the addresses. Depending on your threat model, if you are concerned about the potential for your adversary to, say, subpoena the service you use to mix your coins, or even to hack them in order to discover such a link, then using a centralized exchange is not a great way to maintain your privacy.
There are some advantages and disadvantages to using an exchange for this purpose as opposed to a service like the aforementioned Helix. The most significant disadvantages are that an exchange is much more likely to maintain logs and transaction histories for their users (in fact they would be irresponsible not to), and that they are also (generally) easily subjected to legal procedures like subpoenas. In the case of a pseudonymously-operated mixer like Helix, on the other hand, the operator's identity is unknown and they are therefore essentially immune to legal compulsion of this type. Additionally, a service dedicated to obscuring coin taint is much more likely to wipe any relevant logs that might allow the addresses to become associated in the future. However, one could also argue that a service like Helix is more likely to be targeted for surveillance by state actors, although I personally think that the major exchanges are also a high-priority surveillance target for these purposes.
All told, using **any** kind of centralized service to obscure coin taint has some serious flaws, though it can be better than nothing (it can also be worse). Potential alternatives to such a method might include technologies like [JoinMarket]( or [CoinShuffle]( both of which are still in early development, or using Tor to access a service like [Coin4Coin]( and perform two or more exchanges into and out of alternative cryptocurrencies, preferably including one or more that have some stronger privacy protections than Bitcoin. This will completely sever any blockchain-based connection between the two addresses (but concerns about the service itself knowing the connection will still exist).
Unfortunately, good protections against coin taint are still in their infancy - this is, in my opinion, one of the major unsolved problems with Bitcoin today. If you would like any further information or assistance, feel free to reply here.

[Electrum]( is a good wallet if you don't want to store all the blockchain data. The one thing to keep in mind with "thin" wallets like that is that the server it queries for your balances will know that all of those Bitcoin addresses are held by the same person at your IP address, which may be a privacy concern for some folks. Electrum is also included in [Tails]( by default, now, and so that can be a way to improve the privacy of your Bitcoin a little bit (but the addresses will still be associated with one another, just not your IP address).

Can it be solved in such a way that a single person couldn't flood a sequence of blocks with artificially high-fee txs, and therefore make Bitcoin **permanently** expensive to use?

It really is, and that's really a damn shame. Pretty much the best way to use the WoT effectively yourself is to physically attend some meetup(s) or event(s) where you can have a little impromptu (or organized!) [keysigning party]( Linux Users Groups, hacker conventions, Bitcoin meetups, etc. are all great places to help build your own WoT. But this is indeed a large burden, and one that most people do not bother to take on. It becomes even more rare when people are faced with having to use the command line or "advanced" tools to be able to use GPG in such a way (perhaps a keysigning GUI application exists, or should be developed?).


Aha! I understand. Fortunately, what you want is simple to do (well, as simple as any advanced gpg functions are), and has a fully supported method that already exists and doesn't require you to disable GPG's trust functions completely.
You use what's called a **local** trust signature on the key, which is one that's stored in your own local keyring/trustdb but cannot be exported to assign trust for anyone else. To do this, first open the --edit-key interactive sequence of gpg for the key you'd like to trust locally, and if you have more than one secret key, include the user you'd like to assign trust **from** in the command with "-u":
    gpg -u gpguser --edit-key strangers.email
And you should see a prompt like:
    gpg&gt;
Then, just enter "ltsign" (for **L**ocal **T**rust sign):
    gpg&gt; ltsign
That will then prompt you for the rest, like the following - note that some of these questions may not be presented to you, or may be in a different format, depending on how you've configured GPG:
    Please specify how long the signature should be valid.
             0 = signature does not expire
          &lt;n&gt;  = signature expires in n days
          &lt;n&gt;w = signature expires in n weeks
          &lt;n&gt;m = signature expires in n months
          &lt;n&gt;y = signature expires in n years
    Signature is valid for? (0) 
    Signature does not expire
    Is this correct? (y/N) y
    How carefully have you verified the key you are about to sign actually belongs
    to the person named above?  If you don't know what to answer, enter "0".
    
       (0) I will not answer. (default)
       (1) I have not checked at all.
       (2) I have done casual checking.
       (3) I have done very careful checking.
    
    Your selection? (enter `?' for more information): 2
    Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
    (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)
    
      1 = I trust marginally
      2 = I trust fully
    
    Your selection? 1
    
    Please enter the depth of this trust signature.
    A depth greater than 1 allows the key you are signing to make
    trust signatures on your behalf.
    
    Your selection? 1
    
    Please enter a domain to restrict this signature, or enter for none.
    
    Your selection? 
    
    Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your
    key "gpg user &lt;gpguser (0xAC2111FE25DA921B)
    
    The signature will be marked as non-exportable.
    
    I have checked this key casually.
    
    Really sign? (y/N) y
    
    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
    user: "gpg user &lt;gpguser
    4096-bit RSA key, ID 0xAC2111FE25DA921B, created 2015-02-05
    
    gpg: RSA/SHA512 signature from: "0xAC2111FE25DA921B gpg user &lt;gpguser
    
    gpg&gt; save
...And that's it! From then on, GPG will no longer pester you about that key being untrusted, and even better, you can be assured that any time you attempt to use that person's public key, it will indeed be that original key if GPG doesn't show the trust warning.


Yes! Quite thankfully, too. One simple example of how to use the WoT, even for users without any Trust connections of their own, is for installing software.
Virtually all GNU/Linux distributions these days come with an included GPG keyring for verifying packages from the distribution's repository, to ensure that the software you install is actually the software you intend to install. I have been met with the need to install a piece of software that isn't in my distro's repositories - but it does come with a GPG signature. In order to verify that signing key's validity, I can tap into my OS's own "known and trusted" GPG keys (at least, as trusted as my OS itself, which ought to be very trusted!) to see if any of the hundreds or thousands of developers involved with my distro are connected to the author of the software I want to install, through the WoT. To do this, I just temporarily use the OS's own GPG keyring along with my own. This can be done with GPG's --keyring flag. For instance, if a Debian user wanted to verify if the [Tails]( Developers' Key they've acquired for verifying their Tails download is valid, they might enter a command like:
    gpg --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --check-sigs tails
And they might see that a number of the developers that they already trust to provide software for their OS have in fact signed their version of the Tails Developers' Key! Very exciting indeed (okay, for **some** people, anyway).
Of course, the WoT is intended to be more actively woven by GPG users themselves, and not just by OS developers, and it takes on a whole new kind of usefulness once you start to participate in it yourself. And the great thing is that as more people participate, the more useful it becomes!
Although it is certainly woefully under-utilized at this time, the WoT is absolutely the single most secure mechanism for trusting cryptographic keys that exists in the world right now - it is far, far superior to HTTPS' Certificate Authorities, and even to NameCoin or Keybase, or any of the other mechanisms that have been developed for users to trust cryptographic keys. There simply is no replacement for it, nor has anyone ever yet thought of anything that could.
It is my sincere hope that people all over the world, as interest in cryptography grows, can help to make the WoT a regular part of their secure interactions online - as we all "should." It can be awkward at first, and confusing, but there is no good reason why it couldn't become as routine as sending a Bitcoin payment, or using any other system that can also be awkward and confusing.
If there's no other legacy of the Edward Snowden revelations, I would not be displeased if the only lasting result is an embrace and expansion of the OpenPGP Web of Trust. It would be a huge benefit to everyone who gets involved.

They may be using clearnet Electrum servers, which isn't really much of a problem as long as the traffic is Torified. Using .onion ones is mostly useful to ensure that the traffic is routed over Tor, and it also provides some authentication of the server. The one downside to using the clearnet servers will be this lack of authentication, unless they are configured to use HTTPS or some other authenticated transport, which I doubt they do.

Before I reached this comment, I was actually considering how splitting the "end points" of the payment could be a big advantage, in order to address the privacy concerns being raised. If supplier X will receive $400 from a transaction, why **not** have the option to send that as $38 to one address, $167 to another, $131 to yet another, and $196 to another? I suppose that if using relayed signed payment requests (from the supplier, bundled with the merchant's own signed payment request), the destination totals would be revealed anyway, but perhaps the suppliers' payment requests don't need to be a part of what the customer sees (and in fact, implementing that, at least securely, would require the supplier(s) AND the merchant to participate in the process simultaneously at checkout, which is not the business that suppliers are in).
So in that way, it works a bit like a coin mixing service, or at least it conceals the things that are being paid for a little better. Just intuitively, it seems like having the option to split outputs is a good thing (more freedom, more better!), and I don't see any reason not to do it. Furthermore, it's very unlikely that the amount to settle between merchant and supplier will be an exact multiple of the merchant's retail prices, so at some point that cost will need to be fractioned no matter what, but with "1 payment, 1 receiving address" it means that the merchant will have to settle these "rounding" amounts out of their own balance, which further complicates the matter. I think being able to split the outputs is a very, very good thing - I'm curious why you have concerns about it.

Furthermore, if you must have a persistent workstation, and only a single one, then segregate the various various aspects of your operation and your various nyms with separate encrypted containers.

In this way, LE couldn't just distract you in a library and snatch your laptop, then suddenly read out the decryption keys for **everything** stored on it with no trouble. Compartments are the foundation of security.

Great project, I'm always glad to see innovation in secure messaging systems. My one question is, what kind of mechanisms for Key Trust does the software use, to prevent MITM attacks? I couldn't seem to find anything about verifying keys.
Obviously the standard Certificate Authorities are out of the question, and something like the [OpenPGP Web of Trust]( requires the parties communicating to have an out-of-band channel to compare key fingerprints... I know, this is not an easy problem to solve, but I strongly believe that it is not one that should be ignored.

I believe the longest orphaned chain was 4 blocks, which is pretty significant. That's only happened once (or maybe twice? My search-fu is failing me on this one).
It's worth noting, though, that these occurrences are (at least overwhelmingly) the product of random chance, and they have very little bearing on how feasible it would be to double-spend with that many confirmations. It's akin to the difference between finding a hash collision and mounting a preimage attack on a hash - though they have similar results, one is unbelievably more difficult to do than the other.

To be fair, what you're saying is a bit different - in this case it's not about people "deserving" things but about people "wanting" things. But either way, this fallacy totally disregards the enormous role that history plays in the way that the world (and its economy) is today.
The financial instruments themselves - sure. They'll be back. But the financial *institutions* and entrenched powers, the manipulated regulation and the utter corruption of some of the most powerful agencies on Earth... There is no "demand" for that. What that is is the legacy of feudalism, of genocidal colonialism, of slavery, and of myriad exploitations all the way up to the present day. And that legacy is frighteningly inseparable from every aspect of How Economics Is Done in our modern world, and indeed, from the very same challenges that we face with Bitcoin.
But with Bitcoin, somebody basically hit the "Reset" button. The entrenchment is all askew. Those old-money systems that have essentially lorded over most of the world's wealth for literally a thousand years or more are virtually nowhere in the picture. For now, anyway.

Absolutely not. It is now almost trivial for virtually anyone to produce a file that will have the same MD5 hash as a given original, with a great deal of additional data (such as a backdoor in software). This was the primary infection vector for the U.S. Government's "Flame" malware (see  ).
The only acceptable verification for a software download, most especially a download of a complete GNU/Linux system, is an OpenPGP signature based on a strong hash, preferably SHA-2 or better. One excellent example of this is [Gentoo Linux]( verification for their downloads, an example of which is here:  - they provide two separate, very different and very strong cryptographic hashes for the relevant files (SHA-512 and Whirlpool) which are then cryptographically signed with GPG using their private key. This allows very secure validation of any received files, to ensure that they were not tampered with in transit or on the server. Unfortunately, their GPG configuration is set up to use only SHA-1 as their GPG digest algorithm, but SHA-1 is still at least much less broken than MD5.
GPG signatures are very important, because verifying a download against a hash published on a website is almost useless, except to ensure that the download wasn't accidentally corrupted in transit. That's because if any adversary is able to alter the file you download to contain malware, then they are almost certainly also able to alter the web page you visit that tells you its hash. A GPG signature, on the other hand, cannot be forged, and therefore it isn't necessary to trust the provider of the file itself to provide a trusted hash. However, [ensuring that you have the correct OpenPGP Public Key]( to verify the download is still an important consideration.

Just because there aren't widespread implementations in the wild doesn't mean it's infeasible. Five years ago there weren't any Bitcoin-stealing malware programs in the wild, either.
The host system is an intermediary for everything the guest system does. The host system has full, unrestricted access to arbitrarily read (and in many cases write!) the guest system's memory, which includes not just private keys but keystrokes, program states, etc.

It can derive an infinite number of receiving addresses in the proper order, even offline, from any valid 12-word seed. When importing a seed into the program, online or offline, the only parameter that's absolutely necessary is the "gap" length, that is, how many unused receiving addresses in a row it should consider to be the end of the set. But it can always go back and calculate later addresses at any time, online or off, and will always have access to all the private keys.

On top of that, verifying an OpenPGP signature on an email is incredibly easy, and often even automatic with a proper mail user agent.
Also, what we should strive for is to **expand** the number of users who can use secure systems, like OpenPGP, even into the demographics that don't necessarily understand them. Just like how 99.9% of email users today have absolutely no idea how to actually run a mail server, or manually send an email message with netcat, they still can benefit greatly from using the email technology overall. This analogy can absolutely apply to practics like verifying email signatures, especially with the help of intelligent software.

This is not true. These attacks are against the firmware of the drive itself, and have absolutely nothing to do with the data on the platters. It simply executes on boot, optionally waits for the OS to be decrypted, then implants itself in kernel- and user-space any way it wants.


This is helpful, but not a magic bullet. If malicious code on a firmware level - in any component of the system - gets executed at boot time, the system is owned.

Any kind of effective tumbling is going to "stick out to people analyzing the block chain" - that kind of stealth is not a goal of tumbling. The goal is to provide strong deniability that a given output corresponds to a given input, and that is achieved in this system. There is literally virtually no way for a proper system that does that to *not* stick out on the blockchain - and that's okay, as long as the actual goal is achieved.

That is absolutely, fundamentally, 100% not true. A bitcoin transaction is a cryptographically signed statement indicating payment from *m* specific addresses to *n* specific addresses. If any address is substituted in the output (or input), the signature will be invalid, and the coin will not be sent. Period.
The problems with running Bitcoin Core over Tor have more to do with an attacker spoofing all of your neighboring nodes, which can be a problem, but not nearly on the level that you describe. For more information, see

I know that as well as anyone.
The threat posed by malware on a host system is tremendously more plausible than the threat of a potential Trezor vulnerability, or other "long-shot" security issues.
That's because such "long-shot" security issues don't even have a known *mechanism* that they even theoretically *could* work, in a way that is inexpensive and feasible over a network.
A malware infection of a VM host computer, on the other hand, is not only plausible, inexpensive and feasible, but is something that already occurs on a regular basis.
The fact that Bitcoin-stealing malware isn't yet regularly looking for wallets in VM guest systems is not a representation of those systems' security. It is instead simply a basic tool that nobody has gotten around to writing yet (that we know of).
You are welcome to continue operating in the way you do, but you should only do so with the full knowledge that the only "security" you gain with such a setup is to cross your fingers and hope that the crackers are lazy. For me personally, that is not an acceptable threat model.

Brute forcing crypto at this kind of level doesn't happen through the device's native interfaces or APIs.

Doesn't this solution require exponentially more resources than the above solutions?
Why put this data on a blockchain? It doesn't actually add any security. In the existing model, code can be retrieved from a potentially untrusted source, reviewed, and utilized, with the user opting (or not) to continue trusting that source. In your model, it seems that code can be retrieved from a potentially untrusted source, reviewed, and utilized, with the user opting (or not) to continue trusting that source (sound familiar?). The only difference is that the source's trust model is a stupid blockchain instead of a very simple, persistent GPG public key that provides the exact same functionality with way, way less bloat.

EDIT: My first read of the "whitepaper" was a little confused, but I think I understand, now. Couldn't everything you're hoping to accomplish just be achieved by making the trusted OS repository's public key verifiable via Namecoin or some other blockchain-based Key Trust system? That seems like a much, much simpler solution, no?

There are many, many guides on how to use GPG. [This one]( is my favorite.  also has some good documents on using OpenPGP software (GPG).


Nope! And that's the whole point. An OpenPGP signature is **only** valid for the **exact** data that has been signed - if anything about that data is alterted, the signature will not be valid!

This could really be the way to solve [Zooko's Triangle]( for [Key Trust]( applications. **This is huge.**
ELY13: If you want to communicate with a person, or a website, or anything using an encrypted connection, you need to get their [Public Key]( somehow. The trouble is, since data can be tampered with in transit (or changed on the server), you have no way to know that you're actually getting the right public key - it could instead be one that an attacker has switched it out for, which lets the attacker decrypt the communications and impersonate the other party. This is called a "Man-In-The-Middle" attack.
Pretty much the only real solutions we have to "solve" this problem are the system of Certificate Authorities that's used for HTTPS websites, which is terribly vulnerable and centralized, and the [OpenPGP Web of Trust]( which is difficult to use, compromises privacy and is sometimes ineffective (but at least it is highly secure).
Something like this, if implemented "well" (that is, not vulnerable to the issues that have plagued Namecoin like domain-expiration-snatching, etc.), could fundamentally make secure communications much, **much** more secure, and also provide the basis of real, cryptographic identifiers for virtually any digital device or person/pseudonym using them, and to do it all without relying on centralized services or implicitly trusted starting points (which may not be trustworthy).
This is a problem which was basically considered un-solvable for a generation or more. It is an enormously important breakthrough, and it will change the way that digital communications happen (if not in this software, than in the one that does this "right").

They are (for hashing), but a true cryptographic signature adds many features that a hash lacks.
For one thing, if the site that's providing the download (and the hash) is hacked, it's trivial for the attacker to alter the download file **and** switch its hash for an altered one. With a detached GPG signature, however, the attacker would have to impersonate the provider's Keypair and generate a fresh signature (from a different key). Anyone who already had the provider's public key stored in their OpenPGP keyring will notice that the signature isn't valid, and even those who are getting the public key for the first time can check the [Web of Trust]( or at least do a search for the key's fingerprint on the www and on the SKS Keyserver Network.
Also, a file paired with a detached GPG signature is easy to *redistribute* even over channels less trusted than an official website - torrents, file drops, random web mirrors, etc. can all be effectively honest providers of the data in question.
All in all, GPG detached signature files are absolutely *the* sensible solution to verifying downloads online, and anything else simply isn't as good.

Because GPG keys aren't trusted based on the say-so of one of hundreds of different certificate authorities all over the world, including the Hong Kong Post Office (yes, seriously). With SSL, if any of those CAs is compromised, the SSL certificate can be spoofed as "valid." This is not the case with GPG.


It will, because a concerned user can just verify the email's signature (or see that one is missing), and not bother going through with any of those additional steps, because why would they? Or perhaps they could send an email to coinbase asking to verify the message, since it wasn't signed, and then coinbase knows about the problem right away.

Sorry, I'm having a lot of trouble parsing that comment - it's breaking my brain a little.
The point that I'm making (and I think that you're making, also) is that security is like a long chain, and it's only as strong as its weakest link (or links). In this case, message authenticity is an important link in that chain, and OpenPGP signatures are probably the very best tool we have to secure it. There are also other aspects of security, and those, too, deserve strong and well-implemented solutions to ensure their own security. When all of these links are secure, and the way they interact is secure, then the system as a whole is secure.
The fact that the links in the chain *other* than message authentication are *also* in need of strengthening is no reason to not start signing messages. What's needed is message signing *in addition* to all the other procedures that will help make that entire chain secure. And those things are not exclusive of one another.

reddit ProTip: pipe ASCII armored OpenPGP data through the following command before posting to ensure that it will format correctly:
    awk '{ print "    "$0 }'
For example, when starting with your (plain) message on your clipboard,
    xclip -o -sel clip | fmt -sw 80 | gpg -a --clearsign -u 0x1EC56B0463DD3F13 | awk '{ print "    "$0 }' | xclip -sel clip
will replace the message on your clipboard with a properly formatted, clearsigned version. You'll need xclip installed as well as awk and fmt (fmt is used to wrap the lines at 80 characters, which must be done before the message is signed and not after).
If you want to alias that awk command in your .bashrc or anything (recommended), good luck. Here's how I had to do it to escape all the quotes:
    alias mycommand='awk '"'"'{ print "    "$0 }'"'"

I find it hard to believe that you "bricked" any computers trying to install ubuntu - they wouldn't boot at all afterward? You couldn't install a different OS (like windows)?
If you want some help getting them back online (almost certainly feasible), I'll be glad to throw some advice your way, but I'll need some more info, first. PM me if you want.

I'm beginning to suspect that I'm being trolled.  
  














All of this has very, very little to do with what we're talking about. While theoretically a Trezor device could be a vector for USB firmware-based malware, I don't see its relevance to the security of guest VMs on an insecure host.
To take the bait just a little bit, comparing an effective exploit against a signed firmware verification system for a hardened, embedded hardware device and the possibility of a Windows OS being infected with malware is a bit laughable. Are they both possible? Of course. But one of those is a much, much more pertinent security threat for threat modeling.
P.S. Rooting/Jailbreaking an OS is an entirely different animal than getting unsigned firmware to install on a device that requires signed updates. To compare those two classes of attacks is laughable at best. But I (and we) digress.






I really don't know what to say, here.
Why don't I just link you to this: 
The top answer there:






Hopefully that settles the matter.


No, I do not. I do, however, understand that the threat model of a Trezor device is significantly more resilient than that of a Windows computer hosting a linux VM. If you can quote me at any point literally saying that **any** digital device or software is 100% secure, I'll give you 0.1BTC. How's that?


You'll probably have to wait until the publication of the analysis report regarding the malware that steals your Bitcoin from your "secure" guest VM in an insecure host.
I really don't see any reason to continue this conversation, and I'm sorry if I've offended you in any way. My only goal here is to educate people about information security, yourself included. I hope that you can come to understand the point that I'm making better in the future. Until then, you have my regards.

It wasn't very clear about how the connection exists, but it is in fact there - namecoin itself, as it is, is in fact just a public, distributed store of labeled public keys. In that way, those same public keys can act as the foundation of an SSL system, almost directly, and therefore the connection is not a difficult one.
I think the author's understanding of that kind of bled into their writing, by assuming that readers would understand that leap innately, but I agree, they should have made it more clear.

Not exactly... Once the ASICs aren't cranking out trillions of hashes, the difficulty would retarget *way* down and suddenly the mining field is opened to thousands of new miners with different hardware.

Interesting. Is that "relaying to you" simply the transaction showing up in one's own wallet as an incoming, unconfirmed transaction?
It is indeed *moderately* safe for small sums, but there's still not protection against double-spends, etc. until a miner actually produces a proper confirmation. As I understand it, a node relaying the transaction doesn't really verify much except:
1. Yes, the person has enough coins to send this amount
2. The transaction adheres to the bitcoin network syntax
I do really think that an improvement to confirmation times, or the confirmation system in general, is an important near-future step for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:03:15
Indeed. I think multi-hashing *a la* the scammy quarkcoin is really an excellent idea for ASIC resistance *and* security against crypto attack breakthroughs. Of course anything can eventually be ASIC'd, but a complex mutli-hash system would be very difficult and expensive.

Ah, I misunderstood, I think. I was imagining a kind of email forwarding service that would generate random addresses to submit to things, then forward the stuff to a specified address, with the original "To:" field intact so you knew which one it was.
I suppose the best way to do this would be to just own a domain set up to forward any incoming mail to an account, but it's probably not the cheapest way to do it...

They're not necessarily poor; they're immigrants. And many of them are even full fledged citizens, or long-term residents with work visas.

Yes, but a person intending to mount a 51% would be using those same ASICS. The net benefit to allowing ASICs is essentially zero, because the difficulty scales to the hardware.
In fact, by disallowing ASICs, mining could be done in a much more decentralized manner, as it would open the field to anyone with a decent PC, instead of only those willing to invest lots of money in specialized hardware. The downside of that is that botnet operators could then do lots of mining, but it's hard to estimate how that would compare to the kind of centralization that ASICs have brought.

I agree. I'm also really, really poor, and unemployed atm, and I don't even have any bitcoins :(
Just finished my resume this week, though, and hoping to get some entry-level IT gig. I lived a long time on just about nothing, but I'm at a point now where I'm trying to break into the world of "normal" people - sortof - and it's a bit scary.
Long story short, I've been a full-time political activist for years and years, and that's still my passion, but I am now seeking a bit more stability. Most recently sunk all my money into building a project to offer free heathcare resources and empowerment to people in need all over the U.S., which is going great, but going slowly because of the lack of resources. So I'm trying to gather some nuts and berries in the gross corporate world to bring back to the clan, so to speak, in order to hopefully do a bunch of awesome work that I actually feel *good* about. That's the short version, anyway, but I like talking about the project (and my very unusual past) if anyone's got questions.
I have a lot of hope that things like bitcoin can be a big help to folks like me trying to make a better world, without the need to go through weirdo, pot-skimming things with big barriers to entry (like grants, even kickstarter is hard work to organize well - our project's crowdfunder got us only $450 because we just didn't have TIME to make a pretty video or offer crafty rewards and stuff).
Anyway, I guess I'm rambling, but yeah, I think it's important to consider all kinds of different ways that people can help and be helped.

Or very good consequences for its reputation by seeing a serious issue and taking steps to mitigate it.

These are negligible compared to Moneygram.


This is simply not true. It's really easy to set up a coinbase account, or even run a thin wallet. It doesn't, in fact, require internet access whatsoever until it's time to spend the bitcoin - and as much as you might think otherwise, yes, there is abundant internet access outside the U.S. (in fact, the U.S. is way behind many other countries as far as bandwidth per capita, and even computer literacy - not that much literacy is needed).

I was really just having a bit of fun. I don't doubt that there are more than two moral people in finance - *there could even be as many as four or five!* ...I kid, I kid...
And for the record, I've never seen or read anything Keiser's ever put out...
But my beef with the finance industry has more to do with my belief that it is essentially a tool of the rich to get richer, at the expense of everyone else. And the fact that it occupies an enormous amount of the economy (and many of our best minds) yet does not actually produce anything. But as an anarchist communist, I don't expect most of the folks here to agree with me, and I'm not trying to start a debate. Heck, I don't even think currency in general is a good idea - but I do recognize bitcoin as a powerful, transformative technology that is likely a net improvement, and also hopefully a tool for me personally to gain some resources I might not otherwise have.
I resent comparison to "9-11 truthers or holocaust deniers," as my ideas are the result of deep and lengthy critical thought, rather than zealous, unfounded belief, but they are likely correct that I'm not going to change them very readily - after all, they're a product of literally thousands of hours of study, consideration and debate over more than a decade.
