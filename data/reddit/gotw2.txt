You could always mine now and hodl until 18. But, if you have personal computers to mine on then don't get your hopes up too high. Even ASICs of a few years ago struggle to keep up.

Agree with OP. I like being tipped off when I'm at lunch when Bitcoin is on the move, which is when I would be on Reddit and not have tickers around me. However, I do pretty much nothing when it's below a 10% movement. I don't see the value in spamming about insignificant, or even moderate price movements.

This! Rebalancing your portfolio ultimately becomes so unruly or even impossible that you lose out. Even if you play both sides and accurately move based on momentum shifts, your gains will be muted.

I think Government's will eventually see the benefits they gain by first adding support for Bitcoin, then replacing fiat. Many of the benefits are laid out within the other comments here but they center around being P2P for private parties to transact. There are very big advantages for corporations, and Governments as well.
Corporations miss or beat earnings often purely based on forex fluctuations. Not to mention how much simpler accounting could eventually be. Not having to think of Sats in terms of a conversion to fiat would go a long way.
Governments can and would be able to track all kinds of things they currently try to track but without the need for diligent custodians like banks. The trick is that following the money would be easy, but knowing the ownership would be obscured until you can ID appropriate addresses. They could actually swing more tax revenue this way as well. Added bonus, tax offices could be so greatly reduced because taxes like a VAT could be added in and validated without much issue. Not to mention how much simpler pretty much every monetary endeavor getting simpler. Most companies already maintain licencing and compliance so the infrastructure to monitor and enforce VAT is already in place. Income tax would be tricky, and likely eliminated but that VAT could cover it. I, for one, would loathe that all year I have no idea what my tax burden will be.

Cash isn't traceable, and many countries would still allow it. This may slow Bitcoin adoption or it may even increase interest. Regardless, there would be no effective way to prevent all exchange. Bitcoin can be slowed perhaps, but not stopped. It would actually benefit Governments greatly in the long run to adopt and adapt.

The IRS is clearly panicked based on this release but I'm not certain the reason. They see their own demise, they don't understand crypto yet, they realize the huge hole in the current regulations, and taxing it seems an impossible task. Countless other possible reasons
I would love to actually know but one thing is clear. They so completely miss the point on how and why cryptocurrency works that they're failing to even make sense.

I think you and I have very different opinions about cash or liberty. Also, most overseas stock exchanges would absolutely not accept cash in exchange for shares on their exchange. Also, the reliability is that the value decreases over time. Even for USD cash. Meanwhile, there is a similar but more demonstrative example in the Bolivar, which can also be called cash.

I thought that until I saw the video. He looks genuinely embarrassed to me when the moderator asked about that statement immediately after making it.
Not that I particularly care one way or the other, but I follow it because I'm curious.

Imagining Satoshi shooting people is weird. I like the concept of defeating shills though. A lot.

This is the only way to get through to them. I have also setup a new primary personal email, and will be testing bing and duckduckgo for the coming weeks.

Darn, well I appreciate the feedback! Yeah, my limited research has come up with alternatives that have security issues. Android may be the reluctant solution for now.

I did use google for most searches. I usually don't care about my own privacy but this was purely a habit based on laziness. Now Google has given me sufficient reason to switch, so I'm switching everything. Search, mail, browser, etc. Any Android replacement suggestion? You seem to have already been down this road.

You can mine it but at the moment I would recommend buying it over mining I'd you wish to trade. Rewards from mining are a long-term ideal.

Mining and playing RS, well done.

Convenient for a time but I'm glad you are in position to say good riddance. Everyone has a story like this, mine is about the bank. Glad we have a better option now. Thank you wherever you are Satoshi.

Going to need a lot more Fiat than that with as many hodlers believe Bitcoin is undervalued, and all the Bitcoin "in circulation" but actually lost or otherwise locked away.

Would that also happen in a maximum of 24 hours?
