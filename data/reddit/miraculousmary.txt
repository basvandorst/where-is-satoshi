Bitcoin Companies has its own exchanges. They also trade their money and or bitcoins for sure where they got their profit. Some are also from their vendors' miner's fee. Same with Paxful where they got their money from.

Stay! My prediction is it will rise again. It went down a few weeks ago. It is rising again now. Stay if you don't need to spend it. I am still waiting for the right harvest time from my Paxful wallet. It will rise again anytime soon.

It's unsafe to but bitcoins via ATM machines. I recommend buying via Paxful that uses an escrow. They cover most of the countries and have several payment methods to choose from.

Hold it. It will rise again in my prediction. I'm holding my bitcoins thru my Paxful wallet and waiting for the right time to sell it at the right value.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:58:43
totally agree. Lots of people nowadays invest in bitcoins. I'm waiting for the right time to harvest my bitcoin in my Paxful wallet and sell some of my profits. Maybe about 2 to 3% of it.

Go to Paxful and Register. They have several payment options available and covers most of the countries too.

If you have enough bitcoin to buy a car, it's possible of course! I haven't heard of any car shops that accept bitcoins. but Paxful is where you can surely buy and invest your bitcoins.

Thanks for your advice. I will do your advice. Will sell small amt of profit from my Paxful wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:44:41
It is the same as how you declare your taxes since bitcoins have a value when you exchange it to your currency. Same way I declare my Bitcoin earnings from my Paxful wallet. I am declaring all bitcoins that I exchanged and send to my bank account.

Sell it by batches in small amount rather than all at once for your bank security purposes. They might freeze your account. I don't transfer money to my local bank acct at that high amount because they are eyeing the flow of my account. I store my Bitcoin in a safe wallet in Paxful and transfer by small amount of batches.
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:18:30
Thanks for your advice. Will surely do. I'll sell some of my profits at the right time from my Paxful wallet. Maybe 5% you think is good enough?

Paxful is one of the best places online to buy and sell bitcoins as well as Giftcards. Yes, you can exchange your giftcards via Paxful and vice versa safely as they use an escrow and has a dedicated 24by7 customer support.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:12:19
Try to check with Paxful. I think they have that options.
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:59:07
Hi Guys, This post seems interesting. Can I do the same thing with my Paxful wallet? What is this hard fork mean? Sorry, I'm new to this.
Please help.

I bought my first bits 2 years ago for a very cheap price. I can't remember how much was it. I ignore at that time because I felt that it doesn't have any value at all. Until all of a sudden just the first quarter of this year, I read something about the value of it, I remember that I bought some 2 years ago and stored it in my Paxful wallet. Luckily, I still have my logins somewhere I wrote down from my scratch papers. I got surprised how much my money grew from my Pax wallet. It is now at a value of $2,200. woah!

It's difficult to know. Bitcoin affects whether it will go up and down depending on the volume of investors. If for example, 80 to 90% of investors left the trading. It will go down for sure. but If investors keep on trading, then definitely it will go up. I am still on the buying side with Paxful because my prediction is that bitcoin will rise again for the nth time.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:49:09
That depends on in your country and how much money it goes to your bank account from your Bitcoin trades. You might be questioned by your bank if you are getting thousands of dollars frequently. I had a situation 3 months ago that my bank questioned me where I got my source of income. I told them I am a Bitcoin trader and it came from my Paxful wallet. And they were like....What? What's that? What is bitcoin?...lol
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:09:33
No. always trade thru an escrow like Paxful and similar sites. Paxful uses an escrow so both parties are safe when doing the trade. They also have 24 x 7 support that you can rely on.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:11:14
First, you need a Bitcoin wallet where you can send your bitcoins. Link your bitcoin wallet to your bank account where you want to receive your money.
Like in my case, I have my Paxful wallet where my bank account is linked to it. If I want to withdraw my bitcoins in exchange for my currency, I logged in to my Paxful wallet and transfer it to my bank acct. 
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:46:58
Definitely, you can. But I don't advise to sell it at 1 time for bank security purposes. your bank might freeze your account and interrogate you. I suggest you sell my small batches like what I am doing with my bitcoins from my Paxful wallet transferring to my local bank account.
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:12:35
He might have thousands or million of transactions from his bank account that he was questioned and can't provide anything. I am one of the Paxful traders and it is legal to do the trades. I haven't had any issues ever since the time I started joining. My transaction is just a normal amount. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:34:44
I'll sell mine at the right time. Still investing more from Paxfu bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:48:15
I'm not sure how these companies handle the said situation. But as I remember with Paxful, the same incident happened to one of my Pax friends, They were able to get it. Paxful gave it to the family. They send some documents certifying that the bitcoin owner is dead. Then Paxful released the money.
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:04:49
Is this really true? I don't believe in hearsays. I'd rather study bitcoins from Paxful and learn from the experts.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:54:43
this good news. will use my bitcoins to purchase when I visit Japan soon. Will save more bitcoins in my Paxful wallet.
