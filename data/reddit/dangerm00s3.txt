ermm.. i'm lost with all you guys muttering about his incoherence regarding turing completeness? it was immediately clear as mud to me that he was referring to using another chain or transaction as the looping construct that contained pointers to individual scripts within the blockchain. not atomic but nice in that it retains privacy [of the code being executed] and avoids the nodes having to execute turing complete code. 
He may or may not be NS but everything he said made perfect (albeit arguable) sense. In fact i found Nick's response a little snide and contrary to the true spirit of science.

i share your sentiment. that statement made me suspect the economic model is tacked on rather than instrinsically built into the design.

more BCI bashing? This has to be paid trolls or jealous competitors its absolutely ludicrous.
I can't believe the average Bitcoin user hates a company that has been transparent and fair so much.

nice and concise however when i see bigdata in the title i generally expect to see something that is actually bigdata.
ie very large amounts of data that can only be processed by a cluster of shared nothing servers.

best solution depends on the problem. if the problem is to provably demonstrate customers are holding their own assets
(and ensure customers can recover their coins in a coinbase asset freeze)
.. then this solution is a good one. 
well done coinbase.

it's been discussed before btw
I was considering sponsoring a project to do this - to me also it seems a natural fit if it can be made friction-less and not too spammy.

im sure if you talk to a database engineer they will beg to differ.
the trade off between latency, durability, and atomicity represent some of the most difficult problems in computer science.

to those that argue that a linear increase to tps isn't [ultimately] adequate. I agree, increasing the blocksize obviously doesn't help. In some (many) cases off-chain is suitable. Alternatively (pun intended) sidechains would offer a method of creating a collapsible backbone, synonymous to the 30 year old approached used by telcos to scale.
As with all things, a balances ying and yang approach is statistically optimal. A moderate block size increase buys time to mature side chains, whilst also evolving the operational aspects of a block size increment.

this isn't true - market makers only have the option of providing -better- prices than existing resting orders.
The issue as more that all of the other non privileged market participants don't even get to -see- your limit order and hit it, if it's an advantageous price.

lets try a basic, intuitive, economic/ philosophical argument as to why we should risk a hard fork now.
Price wise Bitcoin 'apparently' stabilised (i.e. floored or rather reached a linear rate of descent).
If you agree the risk can be quantified as being proportional to the economic damage (or benefit) done to holders, then:
-now- is a suitable time to take a hard fork risk as the economic damage from a mistake will be less over time compared to the damage resulting from a mistake during a non linear uptrend.
make sense?
TLDR: Bitcoin needs a boost. it's reputation and value is  (comparatively) low. a few bruises won't matter.

agreed, it's blatant house rigging.

it hurts the arbs and other strategies that operate without resting strategies the most.
Whilst I think it's 100% shark-like behavior, to be fair, participants should only place an order at a price they are willing to fill.
If they get a -better- price than they could see on the order book, they should be happy. (which is what this term really means, for those who write order books, and smart order routing systems).
The issue is more one of fairness - the classic HFT issue. certain participants (the privileged market makers) see crucial information (miss-pricing) before other participants, and may choose to act on it.
IT Bit has been hampered up until now by their enormously risk averse approach (next day manual withdrawals etc). This clause was obviously just a desperate ploy to attract liquidity providers.
Now that their long game (and genius, rich &amp; crew) play has delivered, I would expect to see a lot of organic liquidity growth. They will try to remove this clause from their terms.
I would guess (with no insider knowledge) they are bound by market making contracts with a termination period.
I would expect they will endeavor to renegotiate their market making contracts to remove this clause.
If that fails they will have to serve notice on their market making contracts (1 to 12 months) and re-draw them without this obligation.
Or 
1. they will be soo busy they don't even pay attention to their businss and fail to fix this for another 12 months
2. they are so bullish on their market position, and have an interest in their market makers, in which case they will leave this clause in to milk the cash cow. ++
++ my view is: itbit has an institutional agenda due to their investor's background. This clause is a -huge- deterrent for buy side participants, and so they will seek to retire it ASAP

but then to sweep all the small utxo you have to pay a tx fee for each user. i imagine bitstamp must haved decided they would eat the tx fees on the sweeping to ensure they had multisig end to end
