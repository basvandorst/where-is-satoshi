I sold all of mine at $14000, get out while you can
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:01:28
Actually a bunch of us just want the best thing for Bitcoin, if it ends up being just LN and 1 mb blocks then we're happy, currently we think a block size increase plus layer 2 solutions like LN will probably work better (less fees when taking funds off and on LN). Would be happy to be proven wrong though.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:40:01
Yeah I sold all of those other forks as well, good strategy :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:13:02
Yeah I think you're right, if it were me I would stop at a minimum of 32 mb on bch, then try out some of the layer 2 stuff you guys have going on here! I don't think anyone has any problems with layer 2 so hopefully it works and we can eventually scale bch that way as well :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:33:09
Well I would say I'm apart of them, so I see my sentiment shared between others. Although I do have a different view than some. Firstly I think Bitcoin (or BCH for that matter) will be best used a store of value 1st, and a medium of exchange 2nd (most people use Bitcoin as a store of value today). Secondly, this being the case you only have to scale Bitcoin to around 32-64 mb per block to handle 1-2 transactions per day per person globally, and if it is a store of value than most people will have less than 1 transaction per day in Bitcoin. Thirdly, 1 GB blocks may cause centralization, however 32-64 mb most likely will not, and thus in my opinion is a better long term solution for bitcoin than layer 2 tech.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:00:19
Well what about for all people currently storing cash in gold or other securities, if that's the market we're going after, it's much less than 7 billion, and this much less than 750mb, and thus manageable.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:23:07
I think by this he is saying that, block sizes have increased over the last 9 years, so when push comes to shove the Conservative thing to do would be to follow the trends in order keep things the way they were, i.e. slowly increasing block sizes
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:05:09
I sold all of my BTC, I was holding since $200, I really hope things work out for you!
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:05:54
Not a great analogy, with the internet not everyone needs to know where you are browsing, for a global payment system it's beneficial to have a global database where you can know if you can send funds to any one person.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:27:54
yeah BTC just really can't go above 15k due to fees without overexerting itself. LN won't come fast enough, so I've put my eggs in the BCH bucket which seems to solve the short term bitcoin problems very effectively. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:01:28
Restricting block size right here and now will not work, the market demands low fees, and that's why bch was born. The best hope is to develop better scaling solutions asap, because the market will keep hopping over to what works today, rather than what may work well tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:10:37
There is probably somewhere between a half billion to a billion around the world, so 32-64 mb blocks would work fine for a couple times a month per person. That's way more manageable. 
 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:06:23
Pretty much!
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:29:17
lol you think 10k is the lowest it will go, see you at 3k.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:52:31
BTC does this at the risk of killing the Bitcoin network completely, or halting adoption for years, that's completely unacceptable, and will not work in the short to medium term. Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:31:18
If you look at how people use Bitcoin right now, it's for investment, that's the current market. So as long as it can scale globally to meet that demand then it has succeeded, I think once it has reached that point if people want to try expanding Bitcoin into something else, than layer 2 solutions would be welcome, but 64 mb blocks is not unreasonable first.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:03:22
Yup, we are open to multiple scaling solutions, I hope LN can come fast so we can try it on btc and bch! :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:30:55
Sure, well this is under the assumption that most people use Bitcoin as a store of value, I.e. less than once per day, maybe once per week or month. Which is about how much you would use a long term savings account.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:39:36
It's a common phrase used in software development, more to the point, if you halt adoption for years, another coin, perhaps bch, will take over, money will be sucked out of btc and this nice development of Layer 2 solutions will start to slow down to a halt. You have to keep up with the short term, while also playing a long term hand, otherwise you will lose. Trade-offs are necessary. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:10:55
If it turns out the LN is indeed the best way to scale, (we think it may be layer 2 + a reasonable block size increase) than we will implement something that fixes transaction malleability, like flextrans or segwit for layer 2. 
Cheers :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:19:07
Yeah I do admit that wants to be on top, so they fud the heck out of the LN. However most of the comments focus on how the LN is always 18 months away rather than its actual value as a layer 2 solution. I really hope LN comes out soon though so we can see how it works on both chains, and for that matter would  hopefully help the congestion on btc. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:49:24
except, if somehow BCC will be worth the same as BTC at some point, then BTC will drop by half and BCC will raise up to half.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:04:15
You apparently haven't heard of flextrans
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:48:55
yup. not a bad strategy
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:46:31
Well they control bitcoin core, which has the vast majority of full nodes, thus they have quite a large amount of power when it comes to pushing the direction of the protocol, as was seen with segwit. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:34:59
well of course there are other variables. The one that I can think of that is in effect most now, is that Coinbase has everyones BCC locked up, thus supply drops.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:27:21
market cap is just the circulation times the price of the coin. People want to pay $400+ for BCC, and "technically" there are millions out there already.
If you tried forking bitcoin with no support, each coin would be worth less than a penny, and there would be no market cap.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:47:57
Well the main thing here is you have two ideologies of what Bitcoin should be, either a p2p cash, or something much bigger with way more features. It's my opinion that the best technologies usually have one main purpose and optimize to be the best at it. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:17:17
In general, the idea is that segwit allows for the lightning network which is a fast way to exchange Bitcoin on a separate, non-bitcoin network. Thus in the long run, the argument is that Bitcoin following the segwit path will become a settlement layer rather than a p2p cash system, hence the name Bitcoin cash. 
Both sides worry about centralization, core believes that cash will cause centralization on the network with miners holding power, cash believes core will cause centralization with hub and spoke lightning network companies holding power.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:51:44
Not too bad of an idea, however there I think for thinks there can be more adoption and eventually money if the vast majority adopt only one protocol, I.e. They don't have to develop for multiple chains. This is the opposite of players such as coinbase and shapeshift. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:20:36
supply and demand still applies.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:12:03
yes there is a chance, there is a chance that the segwit bitcoin also wins out. No one really knows what is going to happen, it's best to just hold both coins if you have them in your own private wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:16:35
That's a good analogy to be honest.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:17:03
The difficulty of Bitcoin-C will come down in a couple more blocks, it's a temporary problem.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:58:32
If there is money involved then I can tell you they are linked intimately, as is with all companies.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:15:51
eh, Bitcoin-C seems easier to me.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:58:35
Well the difference here is the original intent of these devices was too light up a room, to fly, or to watch things. BCH folks believe that the original intent of Bitcoin is changing into something else entirely.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:50:31
money doesn't come out of thin air. So when markets readjust, unless people put more money into crypto currencies then you will end up with the same amount that you started with, but perhaps half of the value will be on BCC and the other half on BTC
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:44:47
Satoshi explains how he believes the block size should be raised 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:15:47
Love this, and you are right.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:12:52
If BTC can not scale well with segwit + LN, than you can bet that BCC will have much greater adoption. Also BCC not producing blocks higher than 1mb doesn't mean that it has failed, just that it's being underutilized. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:24:48
Right you are taking about the bitcoin scaling problem. I believe the idea by blockstream is for you to move your funds to an off chain lightning network hub for a fee, then you can transact instantly and with minimal fee, and move back to the regular block chain for another fee. There are other methods to scaling forever some which require a hard fork, but blockstream is against doing any hard forks at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:00:31
We will likely end with three different forks, Bitcoin-C, 1mb segwit, and segwit2x by the end of November. If that happens I wouldn't be surprised if most segwit2x users jumped over to Bitcoin-C
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:44:02
yes, if you are being paid by someone with an agenda, then you do what they say or, more likely, you are working for them because you share ideals.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:20:23
sure, people could be putting more money into crypto, because of these new features, the value would go up then.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:45:39
This is probably the best video out there: 
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:08:49
the catch is that the markets have not readjusted yet. I.e. either BTC or BCC will go down, thus in a couple of days, you should have the same amount you started off with in terms of USD
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:34:11
it's most likely that one bitcoin will lower in price over the other, if bitcoin cash overtakes btc, then it will probably take a couple of months for it to do so. BCC needs to basically prove itself first, so you have plenty of time to see something happen. 
If you hold original(before the bitcoin fork) bitcoin in your private wallet, then you own an equal amount of btc and bcc, and will eventually be able to extract the bcc out. If you buy any bitcoin after the fork, then you basically are choosing if you want to buy bcc or btc.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:48:23
yeah basically after you split your wallet, you will have two wallets with the same address, but running on two different programs. If you send BTC to that address, it will end up in the BTC program, and if you send Bitcoin Cash it will end up in the other wallet
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:11:56
it looks exactly like a BTC address
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:04:46
depends, if BCC takes over then it will get more than 20kb blocks for sure.
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:23:00
I'm definitely more of a bch guy, but I can agree with you though, I'd much rather work with each other rather than fight each other, I even think the LN is super cool tech and hopefully matures someday. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:13:03
DDA is changing on Monday for cash.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:19:13
Well I will say there are many resonable individuals who are looking at the positive sides of both btc and bch, while trying to stay away from the more cult like aspects of each community. For block propagation, graphene looks very promising for bch.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:56:19
At that point fees would be too high for it to be optional for regular use.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:07:47
I hope it's not permanent this time, with Cash's new DDA
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:12:24
Just with segwit adoption, layer two adoption will be slow and arduous, once it finally comes out in two years.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:31:36
it has to do with the fact that over a long period of time, less people will be using the main btc chain, and will have to use something else (i.e. sidechains/LN or altcoins)
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:51:52
I'm talking about adoption of LN hubs, just like segwit, it's likely to be a slow process, as every wallet will need to implement this new technology and adapt. Many won't (also like segwit) 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:54:52
yeah I wouldn't be surprised if there might be some price manipulation by whales. Keep a look out in the coming days.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:23:53
one of three things will happen at that point,
a) People do not mind btc as having high fees, i.e. they treat it as store of value over everything else, and do not move their funds very often so fees don't matter much for them.
b) LN will work as promised and fees on hub transaction(not the main blockchain) will go down, and people will continue using btc in hubs.
c) LN doesn't work and people care about low fees, then an altcoin (bch, eth, ltc ect) will probably take the number one spot.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:14:13
You make so many unfounded slippery slope assumptions, just stop please.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:09:33
the correct thing to do is own a bit of both so you don't feel as scared if one drops to zero or the other :)
That's my strategy at least.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:22:16
Yeah it just seems like this will change the whole infrastructure of how Bitcoin will work and how people use and think about it. Instead of just sending btc from me to you, now there are many more intermediate steps, opening channels, making sure that the person you want to send to is on the same hub, making sure they are online, closing channels ect. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:29:25
Seems like a slippery slope argument, he's also said in other videos that on chain scaling is necessary eventually anyway. I.e. you can have both, you don't have to pick just one.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:09:26
Cash is getting a new DDA upgrade(non contentious hard fork) on Monday so it won't have EDA anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:50:41
It uses the same keys for btc and bch, so you would actually get your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:42:15
Big blockers are not opposed to layer 2 and 3 technologies, that's the thing everyone gets wrong. We just think that a on chain scaling solution is necessary right now, rather than waiting for some LN 18 months down the line. There probably won't be another on chain scale for several more years, and by that time we will have other solutions
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:05:17
Yup, that's why I'm a bit shaky on the whole LN hubs ideas, it probably would lead to one centralized winner in the space.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:19:13
Anyone can fork a coin, so even though most of the main players left and the fork was "cancelled" some people are probably still going to go through with it, you can't stop someone from not forking. It just means they start running a different program.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:44:33
Yeah but no one will, except for the big players.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:49:41
Anything too fast in the crypto world probably isn't real. Don't be surprised if there is major corrections soon, could be whales causing all of this.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:50:17
Yeah you could use coinbase for buying LTC then transfer via an exchange or a coin changer like shapeshift or changelly
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:39:52
Bitcoin is better as a store of value for now. Think like better gold, that can be used anywhere in the world, and has many better properties. I.e. the best savings account out there.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:41:58
I really think he cares about one coin being reached by everyone on earth, he just doesn't think that bitcoin will be that, and is hindering it's progress from all of the stuff going on with blockstream and core.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:36:07
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:08:56
Yeah there's nothing to worry about at all btc will be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:45:08
Not quite, 
The more people that send Bitcoin, the higher the fees go.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:20:32
Yeah this may happen.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:51:51
I've moved quite a bit of mine over to BCH, I think it's a good bet for the future.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:11:06
yeah they should make things more stable I would say, which is really good :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:40:34
New DDA was implemented in cash
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:53:19
Why would a grandma ever want to run a hub, and not just use someone else's? Bitcoin is already too technical for most people to wrap their head around in the first place.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:43:31
Well yes, this will add centralization for sure, and also it makes the complexity of using Bitcoin and developers upgrading their wallet software much more difficult, thus adoption will be very slow and you'll likely see more centralization in terms of wallets out there that support hubs vs not. So overall probably not a good addition to the Bitcoin ecosystem, or one that will take years to see anything come from it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:02:34
You're not wrong, channels do encourage centralization, i.e. some company has to maintain the hub, thus if the company's servers go down than the hub goes down as well.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:33:46
Well big blocks are not the only solution, most people agree that some on chain scaling is still necessary even with other 2nd layer approaches. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:52:30
Not if they are huge operations (think large institutions) setup across the globe. Extremely difficult to take down directly.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:51:27
Well it's simple, if we can lower the full nodes from 10,000, to 1000, and retain all the properties of Bitcoin, than increasing the block size would not harm anything, and just improve all users experience (cheaper fees, faster transaction times)
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:59:30
I wonder why visa hasn't permanently gone down then?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:28:30
The more people that join Bitcoin the larger that ratio of spv wallets to full nodes becomes. It's inevitable, the question I'm asking is what is the minimal amount of nodes required to maintain censorship resistance. My hypothesis is only a few per country. But we don't have statistics on that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:20:04
If Bitcoin is split up between multiple countries (many independent nodes per country, owned by businesses), you can trust that consensus will be maintained, otherwise global political consequences will kick in. 99% of Bitcoin users do not run a full node today.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:06:29
Well my point was the Bitcoin network would still be operational with just 50 nodes globally, this might not be true, but there is a minimum that would keep the network running (maybe 5 per country). At that point the block size could be increased without removing the censorship resistance aspect of Bitcoin. Yes, no one would be able to individually verify transactions, but would that matter to the majority of users? Or would that negatively impact Bitcoin's features.
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:15:29
I sold my btc when it was still up, I was buying it since it was $200, now I only buy bch.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:14:05
I don't see any statistics backing up those statements, and to be honest, almost every user of Bitcoin is a lite client today (coinbase) this trend will continue. Bitcoin seems to have been able to withstand attacks even today.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:40:46
Lol don't insult me, yeah that's what I was speaking about in the original question. Of course you nor I nor anyone can run that type of system, but with only about 5 full nodes per country, the Bitcoin network would still be operational. For anyone that would like to validate their own transactions btc will still be around, but for the 13 million users on coinbase, who only care about SPV wallets, systems where it's impractical to run your own full node like bch meet that market demand more.
I'm just trying to predict which coin will be on top in a couple years, eth or bch I would bet, no need for attacks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:25:50
If all full nodes we're mining operations in the future, then what I'm saying is correct. 
The users may not know (but after a few unconfirmed transactions overseas) they would start to figure very fast and the worldwide political reprucussions would kick in.
How many full nodes do we really need in order to stop one government from taking control? Probably only a couple per country.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:07:35
Sure, one country could deny access to Bitcoin, but if it did become the world wide currency, that would be as if Egypt would ban people from using its own currency. The worldwide political consequences would be gigantic.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:49:12
The Bitcoin community? Come on, every person who stores their Bitcoin on coinbase (13 million last time I checked) doesn't care about a personal Goldsmith vs your "Bitcoin" community of 10,000 full nodes. Once this 13 million realize that they don't care about running full nodes, and can have the same experience with cheaper fees, they will flee to another coin, btc will crash, still be around, but be obviated by better coins that can't be verified on an individual basis, but are still trust less when it comes to a world wide coin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:30:29
The situation is going to get worse, and by that I mean the same as it is today. 99.9% of users not running full nodes is fine as long as there are enough full nodes spread across the globe in order to maintain censorship resistance. My hypothesis for that is only around 5 full nodes per country.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:19
If one node(let's say India) decides to print out more bitcoin, they would be breaking worldwide consensus, people would stop using this service, and they would lose money. It's the same as today.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:17:13
I agree that the special thing about Bitcoin is decentralization, but a lower amount of decentralization still maintains all the important aspects of Bitcoin (censorship resistance) and immediately improves other aspects (cost of transfer). Thus I support block size increases until that decentralization aspect of Bitcoin is harmed enough to harm censorship resistance.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:22:44
Perhaps, I should say that the only full nodes that need to run in the future are miners(5 per country?), then you don't have this problem. the full nodes would be paid by mining. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:41:01
But how many nodes are necessary to maintain bitcoins goals? That's the question, only probably about 5 per country, if your government forks off and changes all their servers, just start using another country's until your government falls in line again.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:59:57
I used to agree with you as well! Until fees started going up to $100+ per kb. LN may actually solve these types of issues in the future, but from my perspective LN + BTC is an entirely different system with an entirely different way of interacting with it, and thus there is the pain point of adoption that is usually unaccounted for (think of segwit)
What I like to think about is what do those 13 million users on coinbase care about, what do the majority of people owning Bitcoin or any cryptos care about, and then invest accordingly, whether that be btc, bch or some other crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:20
I'm just trying to come to an understanding on both ends, and which one will win in the end. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp. Btc user really care about being able to run their own nodes, bch users don't, neither do the 13 million users on coinbase. As long as bch can maintain censorship resistance, via some amount of decentralization through full nodes(maybe only 1000 globally) then I think it will win because it provides cheaper fees when it scales up, vs btc on chain scaling. LN is too far away to say if it will really have an impact.
Not trying to shill, just trying to understand things, and the way things will go (bch may still lose however).
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:04:45
That's the thing, if you look at the numbers scaling just on chain can work by itself. Here is an article showing that: 
Which relates back to my original question of if being able run your own full node is really important?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:36:56
Well it has segwit now, that seems mutable to me.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:47:07
Segwit isn't really helping congestion that much, some argue that a real scaling solution is to up the amount that bitcoin can handle from 1 mb to 2 mb, that's the only change for segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:40:58
There fork is happening, 2x will be supported on coinbase for instance.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:44:45
But aren't hubs centralized?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:10:59
Well there is a certain point where the US government can't shut down worldwide nides, 100 nodes, 1000? Shouldn't decentralization matter to that point and nothing more?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:22:12
What do you mean, minors are motivated by profit, these would be the node owners in my scenario. 5 major minors per country as the only ones running full nodes would work.

Hmm I would like lower fees though, lightning network might take too long to implement and test.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:28:31
What other option is there?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:31:52
At some point that must become impossible. 50 nodes may be too low, but 1000 might not be. It might also be 10000. But if I had to make a hypothesis, I would say about 5 per country (10+ per first world country) and you should be good.

you do realize that if miners don't support the bitcoin network running (if there were only minor nodes left) then they would be hurting their long term adoption of funds. 
also I'm sorry, people are not into bitcoin for altruistic motives. They are in it either because they hate the government, want a censorship resistant store of value, or just want to make money.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:32:08
Yeah, well lots of people are unhappy with lots of things in the Bitcoin space. In my opinion, the real divide is between Bitcoin being prioritized as a store of value or Bitcoin being prioritized (as interpreted from the white paper) as a currency, the former I believe having more current value. So yeah two different groups wanting two different things out of Bitcoin, you are going to get forks in this case. But I don't know if the second idea will ever really take off, even with sidechains.

No I'm with you, 2x is a sensible upgrade. People should be for it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:10
The 13 million users on coinbase do not care about running a full node and never will. As long as the amount of full nodes around the world can maintain censorship resistance, that's all that matters. You should talk to Luke jr, he still wants to lower the block size to 300 kb in order to maximize full nodes, it's ridiculous.

Yeah my preference for bch at this point is from some articles showing that, for instance TB can work properly: 
And my feeling that users switching to an entirely new system (the LN) will be more painful than switching to another coin, perhaps eth or bch. 
This all being said, some users very much care about being able to validate transactions, regardless if another coin takes over, so I really never see btc going away even if it's surpassed.

Off chain transactions are untested, and we don't even know if they will fundamentally change the way Bitcoin operates.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:36:20
What do you mean? :p
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:32:39
wrong, the difference between a scam and legit innovation is that a scam falsely advertises that it provides value when in fact it doesn't. both LN and BCH do not fall under this category.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:05:21
Not if it's split up between everyone country, the consensus of what people around the world decide to use would be what all of these large decentralized servers align to(i.e. people would stop using one institution in Germany for instance, and thus it would lose money). The services that follow what the world wants would rake in the cash.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:45:05
Haha well that's one solution XD
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:43:46
Oh I just found a great video on the problem.  :)

It's likely though that the lightning network will create more centralization with off chain networks. 
2x - on chain centralization.
segwit/LN - off chain centralization. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:38:46
Bitcoin will become less and less decentralized over time, it's just the way the whole system is set up, if you have off chain centralization, then focus switches to off chain services. I mean you have potential for LN only wallets, less and less interaction with the main chain by most users. 
In fact if you have off chain centralization, then decentralization for on chain could be even worse. if less people are interacting with the main chain directly, then you will have less people incentivized to run full nodes, wallets may only interact with LN like services in the future. 
It's very hard to tell from my perspective, if you want more decentralization, then you want more people interacting with the main chain directly.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:30:25
The problem is that with off chain centralization you have a few entities (companies) who now own all transactions within bitcoin, no one will wait 200 minutes for processing on chain, so people will default to LN like services that probably will only be run by a few entities, perhaps in a black box way, and charge their own fees as they see fit. It's the fear that we are bringing banks and middlemen back into the system with this.
More so, with the importance of off chain networks and not on the main chain, you most likely will see more lite wallets and systems that perhaps don't even interact with the main bitcoin network at all and just with off chain networks, thus decreasing decentralization, in a way it could put more power in a few much more than on chain centralization could ever do. To be honest if bitcoin ever really picks up world wide(reserve currency), then most people don't care if it's decentralized or not, and for speed and cost gains, you'll likely see this scenario happen. It doesn't matter if the main chain is decentralized, if that's not where the money or the power is.
