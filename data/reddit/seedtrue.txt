I am simply offering a service. I am not begging for anything. I love and respect BTC and am offering a way out for those that do not love and respect BTC

sad thing is you are right...but than trade them back for more btc than you started with

I just made a real nice trade with PPCs, I have avoided them in the past because I do not know much about them, and their price seems to stagnate. All day the price jumps have been crazy so I took a shot and it paid off nice.

You could always start out small and see how it goes..You could start out with as little as a couple litecoins and trade your way up.

I am not begging whatsoever. I have plenty BTC, I was just giving people a solution. If whomsoever wants to send me BTC I am willing to accept

yeah you may need to add MTgox.com into the mix if you are going to use Dwolla...but it is simple enough to transfer from there if you want to trade other coins besides BTC. However, rumor says MTGox will start trading LTC soon.

btw on a side note....   .02 unconfirmed... thanks to whoever sent that, I will make sure it gets the love and respect it deserves.

maybe...I thought when government outlawed stuff price went up. Like alcohol prohibition and bath salts.

Now the trollbox all over btc-e is claiming govmint.com scared people into panic sells

It is more than that and you guys know it. What would have happened if gox was down a couple days again ? $45? We are giving them too much power, and with the money that is involved, who is to say they are not manipulating market themselves?
