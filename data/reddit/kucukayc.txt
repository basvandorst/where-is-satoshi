What i'm curious about is whether the oracle of Delphi predicted Oracle? Because it would be a shame for a glorious career if not.

If I’m not mistaken, Baba Vanga had prophecies about digital currency, VR and quantum computers :).

It will drop under 9K in apr. 20 minutes. And then we'll see resistance around 8.4K. I hope that line won't be breached.

Now that's the spirit. This is one of the worst moments in crypto. We've all taken hits, some more than the other, but we'll get through this. I sincerely hope the bottom is near now. If we ever go down below 8K, it will be a tough and long ride to resurface. And a couple of days ago some were talking about going the moon :) If we must quotine Jules Verne, this feels much more like the journey to the center of the world.

Now we need to stay over 8.4K for a while. At least for the upcoming two days. At this point any serious fud can trigger another massive sell. Although the resistance around 8-8.4 K looks strong, the best scenario for me would be a boring weekend without any mainstream bombardment.

I hope so. Let's just see.

so nice from you to share this piece of shit with us.

Not an oracle, but a mathematician. I believe if Btc closes above 8.4K today, next week will be all about strengthening that resistance level. If succesful, a gentle surge will follow. If the resistance around 8.4 gets shattered, we’ll need at least 1-1.5 months to clear this mess up. Fingers crossed.

First of all, get away from the screen and stop posting on reddit. You’ll only feel worse by doing these and you’ll possibly make further mistakes if you don’t snap out of this psyche before getting back on the wheel.
What’s lost is lost and there’s nothing you can do about it. At least not for now. I hope you’ll step away for some time, rethink your strategies and make good decisions if you ever come back.
