Much love for Alan Watts (for the uninitiated go listen to some of his lectures on YouTube!).
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:37:14
Did it?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:01:37
Is he in Bitcoin hell?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:57:31
This has been some rapid bounce-back!
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:37:10
This is scarily true.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:39:31
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:40:39
I know, right?!?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:35:54
Some of us take cat comments like that very seriously, buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:34:12
This is a wall to rival what was used to separate East and West Berlin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:49:06
Haven't heard of any such projects in the pipeline for BTC myself.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:14:19
Do they have this with all of their currencies?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:09:20
Does quantity matter at all?
Have there been individuals whose wallets have actually been hacked while running a secure computer?
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:38:51
You like to call them as you see them.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:10:54
That does look eerily similar.
What will the mean price be then? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:08:27
That link is for a collection of 716,027 individual wallets and incidentally the volume of TX and UTXO has dropped off to its lowest levels in months.
I'm more curious as to if they are individual Coinbase customers and why are they all grouped together in such a manner? Is Coinbase considered a custodian for their wallets then and ultimately has control over everything?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:04:30
That guy is priceless!
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:18:19
What if it then dropped to 0 then? :O
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:43:44
Because the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies and their functionality warrant that price tag.
Many cryptos have incredibly lofty goals, it's likely many will fail and die off. There are truly revolutionary things that are going on with blockchain.
Also, every day that goes by and the cryptocurrency market is in existence is another day closer to mainstream acceptance and validity.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:16:44
But maybe $25?
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:17:00
Thanks for posting the list. 
I wonder what criteria they actually used to come up with these 'ratings'.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:15:47
Very cool.
But on a serious note; if I hear that it's a bubble again - I'm the one that is going to pop.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:28:19
There's no singular event but rather a paradigm shift which is far more valuable (hence the massive market of cryptocurrencies).
Adoption is increasing at a huge rate for blockchain use cases and actual cryptocurrency use.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:36:30
How do you *not* trade on this stuff?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:39:48
u/tabbr -100000000 USDT
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:41:20
How so?
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:42:54
Isn't witness location determined in the section 2 diagram of the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:41:52
A girl in these parts!?! I don't believe it!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:07:14
Transaction fee?
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:36:50
The trading volume of futures is very small relative to the daily volume of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:35:17
jurassic_blam, is that you Newman?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:15:20
He actually bought one used like that??
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:17:33
I understand for sure.
It's just that the act of accessing your funds is all the same. How often does that happen at all?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:39:15
Is that chart correct? It says it was at over $4,000 and now it is at about $4.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:42:21
If you ignore the prophet-profit shark then he will gobble you up just like he gobbled up the red candles and crapped out the green ones.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:19:07
I, too, have had this nightmare. I don't wish it on anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:19:26
Anecdotal articles offer little value.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:44:52
What types of higher level software?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:46:20
10K floor! Then bounce back.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:46:11
This is excellent news if it gets allowed on the trading floor! There are so many different options as well, which greatly adds to its appeal.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:21:57
Awesome job!
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:46:56
Why wouldn't they have their SegWit address be their default BTC address?
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:48:24
Do you think it is really that risky to use a software/desktop wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:23:05
Is fine art acquisition a bubble? Are Da Vincis a bubble, they used to be worth nearly nothing and now look at the price?
They don't even attempt to perform any utilitarian value for society.
Bubble much?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:36:19
Nice work, it looks fantastic!
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:42:43
There is a private company behind it then?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:22:35
Nice description.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:19
How will the prophet make such a profit? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:57
For 99.999% of the planet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:30:18
Which side is the dark side?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:29:04
I think Bittrex is great, they've never wronged me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:47:44
Wow, that is awful. I'm sorry to hear that happened to you. It is very similar with Coinbase. They have so many more users now that it seems they are unable to adequately deal with the additional accounts, and their issues, on any individual basis.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:15:59
It's taking a bit longer, but it's heading that direction for right now. Good blockchain prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:28:29
That's a good idea! I'm sure it helps alleviate a lot of tension.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:37:24
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:59:48
Yes. GDAX seems to be higher level, and more secure, exchange than Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:07:45
It seems to be in a grey area for fiscal 2017 but they cleared it up completely with the new tax bill. From 1/1/18 onwards every crypto-crypto exchange is a taxable transaction. 
For the amounts that you're talking about, I would contact a professional before filing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:43:27
Awesome post and video! Thank you for the reminder of what Life is about. It is so easy to get caught up in things we can not control.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:57:19
I believe it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:53:47
All mighty prophet, what will BTCs price be in an hour?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:47:54
Haha, awesome throwback.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:12:47
Yes, for US accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:10:02
Awesome cake! The detail is superb.

@_date: 2017-12-30 03:35:20
Don't spend it all in one place?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:55
Thanks for this tip!
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:27:57
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:42:00
Thanks, solid post.

The emblem in the center of your steering wheel looks like a graph as well.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:48:26
Name checks out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:09:49
Hello it’s me, your lawyer. Give me account info. I’ll get this straightened out.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:47:00


@_date: 2018-02-02 02:16:52
Nice analogy.
