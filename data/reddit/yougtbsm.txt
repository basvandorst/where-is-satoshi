Decimal point error. 
$40.00 
Fixed it.

I’m crying right now watching the bubble burst. ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:07:08
$40.00 to $100.00

Where’s my Lambo?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:09:28
I hope they forgive you.

You only have a few hundred until you realize those gains. Otherwise it’s just paper....err digital profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:10
But it’s not over yet. What if it’s the first 90% correction of 2017?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:14
It was a joke because the market is crashing. Sorry about your troubles. I would contact them directly. Just don’t expect a timely response. They are very busy at the moment.

You sent it an hour ago. When it gets there it will be worth half. Any other questions?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:12
No. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:38
Your $100 just turned into $50, just like you wanted. ��

It’s an OTC stock. Most of them are hard to short. Sometimes if you call the trading desk at your broker and tell them you want to short them they can get the shares for you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:19
Yes. You should wait until you have losses. You know, so it’s good for your taxes. ����

I just checked IB’s shortable stock list and they don’t have it. If they don’t have it no one does. I saw an article that said even Andrew Left can’t find any GBTC shares to short. As the head of a company that makes mostly short bets that says something.

I am sick of rabbit holes!  AMA

He said 10, like $10. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:32:24
Isn’t the fifth wave the final one?

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:40:13
How many coins do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:00
That’s right. If we drive it back down to $100 we can sell our Bitcoin and not owe taxes. Who’s with me?!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:49
I don’t know but he says he closed his trade today. Probably made millions. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:55:31
This one says he was able to short it but thought it would be down more if others could to. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:36:12
Well he’s lying. They do it all the time, but if you don’t have a sizable account... they aren’t going to help you out for one share.

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:55
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:39
Thanks for clearing that up. Would it still be counted as one of the 30% corrections?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:43
I feel so much better now. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:19:47
It’s only 69k because it’s white.
