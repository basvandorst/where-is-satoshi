You had coins in Gox despite people warning not to use them almost daily? Wtf?

Another theory thread. Thanks. Because 250 worthless threads with even more worthless theories wasn't enough yet. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:58:38
Just fuck off already. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:23:53
In caps. Then you must be right!

Next comment will be how this is actually a good thing.

Do you realize there are at least 50 posts with exactly the same title as yours and how people like you make this place more worse everyday just because you refuse to use the search. One simple search man. Just time hitting the search and you'll have your answer explained in dozens of topics.

I think we should start reporting these threads as worthless spam.

Stop posting till you reach the age of 18 or actually in your case maybe 22 or so.

Everybody is watching the charts on their computer. Piss off with your "breaking news" you dumb fucking kid!

Congrats idiot. You are the 250th person to start exactly the same thread in the last 7 days. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:17:20
Enough of these threads. Please. We've had 100's of the same threads now. Just stop it. They are all based on guessing. Completely useless.

Did i hurt your feelings?
Are you one of those idiots who kept on trading on Gox after 1 year of warnings? Is that why you are so butt hurt?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:59:37
How is the future shaky? According to whom? Did they just make that up?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:24:48
Another worthless update with no info whatsoever. Is that guy completely clueless or smart as fuck? I just can't figure it out.
