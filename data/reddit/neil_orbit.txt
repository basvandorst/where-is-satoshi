Sorry for making a vertical video. We were simply too excited to try out the new Bitcoin purchase feature at midnight that we forgot to record sideways!

For now you can only buy Bitcoins. You can't buy tickets with it

Thanks for your uplifting support ��

Was the video stuttering or buffering unusually? Would be great if you could say which OS and browser you use so we can look into it
@_date: 2016-11-11 12:12:12
Yes, you can also buy with credit/debit cards and contactless cards

We bought with the minimum amount of 20 CHF and got 0.025817BTC. The fee is approx. 9%

As we have our own platform to share videos, we wanted to share this over our own servers. This gives several advantage, for example the video doesn't get compressed and it should play on any device.
I would be glad if you could say which device and browser you're trying to play it on so we can look into it.

Great! Glad to hear it worked out

No, with the current system this is not possible and we haven't planned to implement this.

We've checked but couldn't find an issue in our end. VPN connections to the website should work fine

Orbit works similar to any other file sharing system, but we added a twist. We only accept Bitcoin as a payment and we don’t offer premium accounts. Instead we charge small amounts for traffic usage and offer those traffic packages to everybody, not just the buyer.
This allows everybody to host and spread files for relatively small prices. Orbit is politically independent, ad-free, doesn't force you to download malware and doesn’t collect any user data. Thanks to Bitcoin, Orbit is discreet and can host various files, that might be unwanted at other places. Let us give some small examples:
* [Citizen Journalism about the U.S. election campaign](
* [The conflicts happening in Ukraine, Syria or North Korea](
* [The No Man's Sky Leak that was taken down by Sony falsely claiming on copyright infringement]
* [9/11 Documentations – because many forces try to silence people who talk about this horrible event]
Since we're still in early access, we're happy for any feedback. You can either do that by writing to me here directly or if you want to stay anonymous, you can send feedback in the Orbit website.

Excuse me for the long wait
We will consider adding altcoins in the future
