These threads always make me chuckle because it's a completely different ballgame when you're dealing with factors like a family, retirement, or 6-7 figures of liquid assets, or any combination thereof. More power to the young folks out there moving hard on bitcoin, but just know that your situation is unique.

The brilliant part of this is that depending on how you rotate your arm it can apply to both the spikes and the dips.

I'm confused about the taxes.
If I buy 5K worth of bitcoin, then sell 1K,  then later that year I buy another 1K, in the tax-year aggregate I have not made any gains.  I still hold 5K of bitcoin.
Do I pay taxes on that 1K sell I made?  That seems unfair and not playing by the rules that the rest of investments play by tax-wise.

Storing your savings in such an incredibly volatile landscape is very dangerous and irresponsible. Unless you literally don't care what happens to that money (e.g. You won't need it for an emergency or a large purchase like a home), and if you're that rich, then fuck it why even bother.

Bigger cheers to those who bought that dip.

For the purposes of hypothetical, lets say that the price of bitcoin was 100% the same for all 3 of the transactions.
