Good point, yes. Tusk is Buffett, but they both play the same mentality, which I think is the source of a lot of the tension between them.

I maybe didn't read what I was supposed to out of this. It looks to me like they're dumping first to create a price drop and buy back at profit. This is more of a dump and pump. Cool by me.

Watch the American version of "House of Cards", Frank Underwood plays more of a southern version of this, but it's pretty much the same thing. If you make people think you're simple they'll never suspect your devious machinations.

If you were trying to buy drugs in the street you probably would have been shot first, then your money would have been taken from you. So, consider that buying drugs on the internet with bitcoin is a vast improvement over the old system. Now you just get your dumb ass robbed instead of robbed and shot. This should be seen as a net positive. The marvels of technology.

I did the same thing in 2009. I installed the client and let it try to grind out some BTC on the CPU. I don't remember if it ever did... I was on my work computer and deleted it before the end of the day.
I was buying silver at the time. If I had just forgone one ounce of silver and put the money into BTC I'd be retired by now. My gut said no though, and my gut was wrong. 
Reinstalled QT client this past Sunday. Had 1 BTC in the wallet by Friday.

If anything, it's a way for Americans to have a chance to grab some Chinese money. There will come a time, soon, when the Chinese no longer want our money, and they want to find ways to get rid of it. Making crazy buys of bitcoin is one way that I can see that happening. Bitcoin and gold/silver are my attempts to grab a slice of the pie before the USD house of cards collapses and we end up in hyperinflation.

It seems to me that OP's system is speculative in nature. As a seller, I'd rather get the 9 quarks for my product than take 5 and *hope* that the value doubles.
Would you take an ounce of gold worth $1200 which is below market, or $2000 right now?

Yeah. I got my first and last block erupter on friday. I bought it mostly as a curiosity. I can flip it and sell it for double what I bought it for right now, and I probably should considering the estimated profit that each of these will make is equivalent to $10 USD, if put into place last week.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:52:30
Newbies that don't understand difficulty. If you could just plug one of the block erupters in somewhere that you had free power and crank out a few millis in perpetuity it would be a no brainer. Most people I don't think understand that these machines will be obsolete in a matter of weeks.

That's because they are holding. Everyone knows these prices are a panic sell.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:05:24
Everyone bashes daytraders, but they are the ones who make the prices stay somewhat stable. By providing regular buy and sell orders they keep the price from spiking. 
Bitcoin will trend upward and we all want it to, it's the up and down spikes of several hundred dollars in a day that are causing worry among less risk tolerant investors.
A fixed price is not going to happen. It's a deflationary currency that is not designed to be pegged to an inflationary dollar. There's a limited supply of bitcoins that are being chased by a theoretically infinite amount of dollars.

I've been paying $80-$90 per 0.1 BTC all week. Once the Mt. Gox and Coinbase verifications go through I'm expecting a spike of buyers. Next week $790 is going to look cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:46:09
New subscribers waiting on the 5 business day waiting period for verifications. 
I applied to coinbase and Mt. Gox on Sunday. With the Monday buzz in Washington I'm expecting that they had a lot of new signups on Monday, which I'm extrapolating from the number of new nodes in the network. 
My coinbase account got verified this morning and my Mt. Gox account is still in limbo. I've been scrounging ebay all week. I'd reckon that most of the new buyers haven't even taken their seat at the market yet.

Mined 0.00004 BTC and sold the miner for double what I paid for it. Good week.

It'll be like when the dollar was backed with gold. 
It's also somewhat comparable to real estate. "They ain't makin' any more of it."
Also, all of those old adges about money will apply again....

No, daytraders buy and sell very quickly to make money on small price movements. Buy at $750 at noon, sell at $800 at 4:00, for example.
The price increases have more to do with supply and demand. Buyers right now are holding, so there are fewer bitcoins actually for sale. Since the pool of available bitcoins available for purchase is smaller, sellers are able to charge higher prices because buys have few options available to them.
For prices to drop, there will need to be a lot of sellers trying to sell their bitcoins all at once. When that happens, they begin undercutting each other on prices, bringing the "market" price of bitcoin down.

I have a feeling that Asian sounding names are going to have trouble gaining traction with a lot of the world. I'd go with something like this to keep with the theme and provide names that easily roll off of the toungue:
1 BTC = 1 Godzilla or Zillas
1 mBTC = 1 Mothra or Moths
1 uBTC = 1 UltraSato or Ultras
1 Satoshi = 1 Satoshi or Satos
Problem solved. Well, except the Toho licensing.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:50:18
True that. I discovered Bitcoin in 2009 through libertarian circles, I wrote it off because it seemed like another Fedora wearer wanting to stick it to the man. It wasn't until I had a google engineeer wanting to donate some bitcoins to a project that I took another look at it. I am as anti-gov as they come, but I'm not going to waste my time on something I don't think will pan out.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:15:41
Only if you can buy on the market... I was paying a 30% premium over "market" on ebay on Sunday. 
You're only going to be able to buy at the price someone is willing to sell for. I expect to be waiting quite a while for my Mt. Gox and coinbase verifications. If you can't wait then you have to pay street prices.

You're not making sense. The dollar already is divisible by 100. 
What is used by the civilized world? Tuppence? farthings? pieces of eight? crowns? florins? shillings?
Is the eurozone so devolved that they can't handle basic division like the Anglos?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:46:17
Just come up with different names. People can handle quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. They can handle named divisions.

Yep. It's cheaper to buy bitcoin directly, even at this week's rates, than to buy the hardware and hope to break even before it's obsolete.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:17:46
Exactly. The government essentially stole wealth from people after promising them that their money was "good as gold". By the time Nixon took us off of the gold standard the dollar was a complete lie.
The only reason that the dollar became the reserve currency of the world is because it was backed by gold, and then it floated on the US' reputation after the 70's. 
If you look at history, the dollar actually increased in value throughout the 1800's, and then became relatively worthless between the Federal Reserve Act and the present day. 
Taking the dollar off of the gold standard allowed the government to perpetuate the lie that the dollar had become and continue to erode wealth through inflation. 
The gold standard kept them honest.

Lots of buyers after the congressional hearings. Volume has leveled off after that. I'm tapped out for now, so I've stopped buying.

Got in at $650. It was back to $800 a few minutes later and I was kicking myself for not buying more.

A currency with a persistent data trail and publicly available ledger? Why would a government spy agency with the resources to map those transfers have any use for that? 
I figured that the moment I put my bitcoin address on my site the NSA computers started linking every transfer into and out of that wallet to me.

I applied to Mt. Gox on Monday and I'm still waiting on verification. The also raised the wait time on verification from 5 to 10 business days. I'm expecting a lot of buyers are waiting for that. I also made a small purchase on Coinbase on Friday and I have to wait a week before it arrives and I am allowed to purchase more. I am expecting that there are many others that are just sitting here trying to get  a seat at the market.

The time to mine was 4 years to 6 months ago. Mining isn't profitable right now unless you want to spend a minimum of $10k on the latest rig. Pay attention to ship times because a lot of manufacturers are promising amazing equipment that will be obsolete by the time they ship it. Anyways, good luck.
