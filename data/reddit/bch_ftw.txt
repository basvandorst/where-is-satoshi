Actually, based on the 37814 tx found in [block 479469]( of Bitcoin Cash, [PayPal level]( is possible with 25MB blocks, 1.3TB/yr, at as low as 1 satoshi fee per tx.

Miners [make more mining BTC]( due to congestion though

When blocks aren't full [you can actually send for a single satoshi]( so your absolute minimum isn't so absolute. 1 satoshi at a price of $1000000 means a fee of just 1 cent. But yeah, point taken it could be used to spam when the price is low. Miners could set a reasonable lower-limit as needed.

Based on the 37814 tx found in block 479469 of Bitcoin Cash (63/s), [PayPal level]( (6.1B/yr) is possible with 25MB blocks, 1.3TB/yr, at as low as 1 satoshi fee per tx. Gigabyte blocks, however, would be needed to handle every domestic transaction in the USA.

They may be able to recover coins that were attempted to be spent, too, if they haven't already been exploited by people like OP.

It is their fault, but it's still [theft]( in many jurisdictions. The finder has an opportunity to do what's right and lawful but has chosen to take selfish advantage instead.

The laws that apply to people using the internet depend on where they act or send from and where their communications are received.

You wouldn't blame the coins if someone accidentally put them in the wrong vending machine... Also consider that BCH is based on bitcoin as it was before the SegWit fork. Anyway, the developers are considering a few different ways to change the address format to reduce confusion, subject to user feedback, etc.

It's BCH worth around $600k across 400 transactions.

Here's an honest and unselfish service:
"Have you sent Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin Segwit address? Worry not!   has got you covered!
We are proud to announce our new Bitcoin Cash recovery service. Please send an email to admin to begin the process."

BCH is based on BTC before the SegWit fork, so it's simply the current popularity of the fork that caused the confusion. Going forward, as BCH competes and gains more market share, I don't expect it to follow along with everything BTC does to save users from themselves. The developers could have changed the format but chose not to, likely because of the desire to stay original. With that in mind, whether they should have or not is arguable, but the resulting confusion may indeed lead to a change.

Contact the miner that mined the transaction as they might not selfishly scam you of 30% or more like bchsegwitrecover.  Don't try to spend the coins from the segwit address as that will reveal your private info and let any thief like him mine it.

Stealing from innocent people for making a mistake is funny to you?

If you really wanted "to help" you'd return them for little to no reward. Most of the funds likely belong to individuals who aren't rich and need the money, not big, evil, faceless corporations.
