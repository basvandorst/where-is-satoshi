Warren Buffet and the Yale economist who called the housing bubble, yea what a pair of dolts! 
I used to love reading yahoo stock message boards as the internet bubble came and went 18 years ago.
This time it's even better, almost like being a grand parent now vs. a parent then.  Back then I had ESOP shares, I was forced to care.  Now, I get to enjoy the sheer lunacy, but put it away at night and sleep well!

It's like the very early days of the internet bubble, when there was one hot stock, Netscape. Netscape was the first way you could invest in the 'new commercialization' of the Internet.  
The people behind http and the browser were committed to the vision then, just like people are committed to a decentralized crypto currency now.
No average Joes obtained long term wealth solely by investing in Netscape back then, the public that invested pretty much lost everything.
Yet browser code runs everywhere, it is ubiquitous.
Same thing with crypto, yea it is coming, in some form, but I very much doubt it will play out as the average Joe investor currently thinks.  
HODL could be the worst advice ever

Wow , Nortel!  Always used to confuse them with Novell.  Nortel was modems?

I tried day trading once during the internet bubble (both up and down).  After 3 days of it,  then 2 days off, then 3 more days, I was spent.  I had to stop,  it was making me sick.  And that was just 8 hours a day of intense focus, with plenty of sleep, etc.
How do you know when to end your day? Isn't it pretty much the same 24 hours a day?  Do you fear missing out on something if you sleep?  Should a new term be invented for quick in and out trades of crypto?  Coin Flipping?

In the insurance industry there is a common metric used to evaluate a insurance book of business, loss ratio:
    premiums collected / claims paid
In certain lines of business,  a loss ratio approaching %100 can be acceptable,  simply because of the interest generated by the float,  the pool of premiums collected sitting around for a year or more until it is paid out in claims.  
A typical loss ratio for a large national auto insurance book of business is &gt; 90%,  some are 99%.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:08:34
There is no real deadline actually,  the penalty maxes out at 25%,  after that it's only interest, which is about 3% per year.  So the first two years are painful,  after that, less painful.  It is pegged to an index,  so if interest rates shoot up,  so will the rate on your IRS debt.

I've got an Internet bubble horror story.  Friend worked at one of the major (not DOT COM) Internet players.  He bought $50,000 of his own company's stock.  He had many ESOP shares,  he exercised enough for the $50K.   He rides that investment up to about $200K in less than a year.  He sells thinking the market had topped, (it was only the dot coms that burst initially).  Then he panics thinking he sold too early and buys back into the market.  Then it crashes,  his $200K becomes $20K in 6 weeks.
The real pain came at tax time when his CPA told him he owed taxes on the $150K profit he took.  He didn't think to sell to realize a loss to offset the gain.  He just hung onto the stock.  He had to pay taxes on $150K in profits that had since evaporated!

That's pretty much exactly how people who didn't understand the internet and browsers thought.  They thought owning a part of the first and only 'browser' company was like owning a piece of the internet.  It was NOT!   The things you read that justify investment in ANY crypto currency all eventually evolve into techno babble that doesn't hold water when scrutinized, at least for me,  and I've been at it almost 40 years.

Old guy here,  went through market crash in 87 AND the internet bubble 1997-2001.   I remember guys spewing TA back in 2000 justifying whatever.  It all went to shit in the end because TA seemed unable to identify hype.
Remember that the Internet bubble did NOT burst in a day,  it was a several months long process.  First the BTC (think Pimentoloaf.com) collapsed, and money shifted to BTB (think early cloud).  Then the BTB collapsed several months later.
I worked in the industry,  as did almost all my friends.  I was lucky,  I got out, no one else I know did.  All these years later it's still unpleasant to think about,  one friend still brings it up at least once a year.
Please people,  do not risk your future over this,  it's hype, just like it was in 1997 when Netscape was the future.

the first year you engage in 'extra' income,  you can get away with just filing your return, and pay any tax if you owe it.
On your second year of earning extra income,  the IRS expects you to figure it all out and pay 1/4 of your estimated tax due every 3 months.
The penalty is based on your prior years filing.  If last year you reported $1,000 in Schedule C income,   and THIS year you also earn $1,000 in Schedule C income,  and you don't have 90% of the taxes due this year already pre-paid,  you'll owe a penalty.

I'm one of the skeptics.  I've worked in tech since 1980.  I worked for Silicone Valley firms before and during the internet bubble.  Most close friends did as well.  I had about 20 friends and close associates who were millionaires on paper at one point.  ESOPs!!!!
I saw that I was in a bubble, exercised and sold everything over three nerve wracking days, incurring a massive tax hit. I tried to get my close friends to do the same, none would.
It kind of sucked being the one that cashed out, while all my friends didn't, and in some cases lost money when they got cocky and started day trading.
I make comments mostly to remind people that there are such things as bubbles, they do happen, and bitcoin could be in a highly speculative bubble right now.  
Remember the Netscape IPO? Any value Netscape once had is now gone, yet browsers are everywhere and the internet thrives.

The US tax selling season is almost here:
1)  US was late to the party,  meaning US represents a disproportionally large number of 'bag holders'.
2) Many inexperienced noobs started day trading, and got caught exposed during the crash so near the Holidays.  They don't have the cash now to pay taxes on their winning trades in 2017,  and are sitting on under water bitcoin and praying for a recovery.
3) As the tax filing deadline approaches , more and more of these noobs realize they have to raise cash to pay taxes,  they'll sell whatever they have to to raise cash.  That includes their under water bitcoin.  
EDIT: 4) You can't get an excuse from the late payment penalty because "you have an investment that needs to go up before I could pay".  
I watched the NASDAQ during the Internet bubble's first tax related selloff,  it was by far the steepest!

Actually,  as bitcoin crashes,  and the few who walk away with most everyone elses money  need to put that money somewhere,  it could spark a small rally in the stock market.  
If the losses are concentrated in a few geographies, i.e. China and India,  it could disrupt the entire global financial system as everyone else has to react to the distress.

Yes,  you can file form 4868, and you can actually take as long as you need to pay,  except that you pay  0.5% per month penalty (to a max of 25%).
You can't get out of that penalty though!  Here is the relevant part of form IRS 4868:
    The late payment penalty won’t be charged if you can show reasonable cause for not paying on time. Attach statement to your return fully explaining the reason. Don’t attach the statement to Form 4868.
"My investment had tanked" is not considered reasonable cause.

If you mined the bitcoin,  then you get to deduct the expense incurred to set up.  You purchased a piece of equipment and because it's a computer you get to depreciate it over 5 years straight line.  So if you paid $1,000 for a computer,  you claim $200 of expense,  your $3000 in mining profit is now $2,800.   You keep going,  deduct electricity,  software expense, internet connection,  they are all expenses that go against your profit.
Report all this on a Schedule C 'Sole Proprietor',  you're 1040 form has a line when you add any income from your Schedule C.
There IS a point where if you report enough Schedule C income, relative to ordinary salary from your W2, you will owe a penalty for under withholding.   This would be minimal in your case,  and depends on last years reported income.

Basically all you do is report the total of all gains and losses for the year,  one number.  If that number is zero,  report nothing,  do nothing.
If you ever get audited,  be prepared to show all your trades demonstrating a net gain of zero for the year.

Remember that the internet bubble did not pop in one day.  It actually took about 2 months.   The start was the dot coms,  who can forget 'pimentoloaf.com'.   When they started collapsing wall street didn't want to believe there was that much hype,  so money swiftly moved into the BTB (business to business, infrastructure, early cloud stuff).   Some of those stocks were still appreciating while the DOT COMS imploded.   That did not last,  and soon the BTB space collapsed as well.  
If you think you will hear a pop,  you are wrong!  It'll be more like a long greasy fart.

They wanted to believe,  and who wouldn't of at the time, people were making money, a lot of it, anybody who wasn't making money,  but knew someone who was,  just blindly bought in.  Greed is an incredible drug,  I watched it destroy several close friends.   To this day one of my best friends still brings it up, because I got out in time and urged him to do the same,  but he didn't.  I have at least 7 friends who watched 7 figure fortunes evaporate over 3 months,  and they just sat frozen, unable to believe they were wrong.  So sad.

@_date: 2018-01-17 18:56:54


Nope,  the dot coms blew up first.   But there were plenty of other internet companies that were not DOT COM, (we called them BTB - business to business).  They were the back end infrastructure plays, that went into bubble mode and burst as well.  A lot of the refuse ended up owned by Oracle.

allows it to happen to an extreme,  to the detriment of the market.
greed and human nature cause one to 'manipulate' the situation to ones advantage. 
laws and regulations exists to make sure no one can unfairly manipulate,  so the strong can't exploit the weak in society.
to think that manipulation is unique to the crypto ecosystem is naive
when someone thinks their investments were unfairly 'manipulated' in crypto markets,  they are fooling themselves.
the crypto markets lack regulation,  allowing extreme manipulation
but it's the fact you invested in an unregulated market that caused your investments to fail, if you need something to blame

If you did all your buying on an exchange,  you should be able to get a history of those buy transactions.  The IRS will expect you to do this,  and if you can't,  they expect to to hire someone who can.
You may have a legitimate excuse as to why the transaction history is not available,  i.e.  Exchange exit scam.
The best thing to do in that case is make an honest guess,   document it, and file that along side your tax return when you are done.

I was wrong, it shouldn't make sense.
You only have to average if you CAN'T find your buy history and all you have is receipts of money going in.
If you have your transactions,  you can match up buys to sells on a FIFO basis,  (First In, First Out).   You could also choose LIFO, (Last in First Out),  but whatever you choose,  you have to treat ALL of the asset's transactions the same forever forward!
Obviously if you want to pay the LEAST amount of tax,  you could choose LIFO (the LAST purchases you made,  which are the most expensive, are the first to be 'sold' and their profit calculated.
If you don't tell the IRS anything,  they ASSUME you've chosen FIFO!  It doesn't matter what you choose,  so long as if you ever get audited you can show you've always used whichever method you choose.

I'm not commenting on any specific Investigation,  I don't know if NYSAG is investigating.   I was answering a simpler question,  which was 
"who else besides the SEC is investigating"
my answer was "NYSAG,  finance/securities fraud unit",   they are the most likely second source for investigations relating to securities fraud,  in the U.S.,  and by inference the source for secondary investigations launched into crypto, IF THEY EXIST.

Regarding tax selling:
As tax deadline approaches people will undoubtedly launch a new class of FUD missile , "the tax sell dump".
I remember this from the 2001 crash on Yahoo stock message boards.  
March 2001 saw some pretty steep drops  but the actual tax day was rather uneventful as I remember.
I had two friends caught in the tax trap in 2001,  NEITHER of them payed the taxes they owed on April 15.  Both chose to take the penalty,  and pay the interest thinking their stocks would recover.  They actually did somewhat,  but never enough to get them in the money.  Both sold when the market was better, but both sold down way more than 50%.
So be prepared for a longer lasting 'tax hangover',  I think it may be easy to do some math because the interest rates on unpaid taxes are known.  I actually think the tax selling effect will be MORE sever than it was in 2000 &amp; 2001.  The NASDAQ bubble started popping early in the year 2000, plenty of time to react properly and learn about taxes.   The crypto bubble started popping right at the holiday season,  everybody was distracted.  I have a gut feel there are a lot of people stuck in a tax trap,  and a far more sever one due to percentages of rise and fall of crypto bubble compared to Internet bubble.
good luck!

the "Others"  are the New York State Attorney General's office.  Because NYC is basically the financial center of the world,  there is a lot of financial fraud committed there.  That has led to the NYSAG's office to have a very very robust 'finance/securities fraud' investigative unit.  This office feels not ONLY the need to protect the citizens of the state of New York,  but also the need to protect the integrity of financial markets in general,  seeing as the state of  New York derives so much income from taxing them.

Actually,  back then there wasn't the term 'hard fork'.  Back then it was just a simple 'branch' in the sccs source tree that may OR may not have been merged back into the base tree.  
I never heard the term 'hard fork' until crypto,  which is a fork in the source tree that breaks the blockchain protocol,  requiring (creating/cloning) a new coin.
I kapplied the term "hard fork" to that old situation because it would of changed the basic Unix APIs,  or created  two Unix versions.  Remember this was a research and development lab, not a real tightly controlled corporate IT department.

The housing bubble was NOT driven by speculation.  It was driven by people who are un-qualified to obtain mortgages flooding into the market for homes and that market was unable to grow with demand, hence valuations went up.   The only speculators were house flippers and they were not a significant overall factor.
The housing bubble was NOTHING like the the (Internet/Crypto/Tulip) bubble.

* lack of knowledge - satoshi bitcoin itself is complicated enough,  but the crazy crypto eco system that sprung up is so convoluted and contrived that virtually nobody has any idea where their investment fiat actually is or what it is doing.
* fear - of being left behind,  economically , socially, etc.  Social media is a particularly lethal accelerant here.

Yes, it was a bubble
No it is not done popping
I watched the Internet bubble pop,  and crypto is behaving in a very similar pattern to March 2001.  It was tax selling then and it is tax selling now.
BUT,  the upcoming 'tax deadline dump'  will be a dud.  Why?  Many will simply file,  not pay their taxes,  just eat the penalty, then endure the interest thinking things will recover shortly.   In 2001 they didn't,  the tax overhang lasted years as people saw the interest accumulate,  yet no recovery,  and they couldn't hang on and sold at great loss. 
edit:  I put originally wrote pump,  it was an expected big 'dump' just before tax deadline that didn't materialize in 2001,  that is what I'm assuming will happen this April,  the tax selling effect started late Feb and will last well past April 17.

This is so much like watching the Internet bubble burst.  I often monitored the Reddit equivalent of the day (yahoo stock message boards) back in 2000 and 2001.   
If what I saw back then is any indicator,  we have not seen bottom.  In order for a true historically correct bottom,  you need to see mass 'capitulation'.  
I learned this term AFTER the Internet bubble burst,  from talking heads on cable TV.   They defined it technically,  some shit like 'steeper than previous blah', plus other mumbo jumbo.
I kind of went back over the message boards after the bubble , relishing all the flames I got as I was short and screaming 'bubble' almost from ATH. 
Here is what mass capitulation looked like on social media:
1) quantity of posts (doesn't matter short/long)  drops off and stays off,  and get's noticed by the remaining.
2) unless the poster is truly delusional (it's obvious) the delusional wishful thinking posts stop completely (all hope is lost?).
3) celebrity 'posters'  (always long, today that's reddit,youtube,twitter, etc.) start to switch/defect,  mea culpa's , I'm sorry's,  etc.
Other observations:
There is something about 50% as a mental threshold.   At the top of the Internet bubble,  I could get some of my friends to accept that things were headed down after rises &amp; splits equalling maybe 800%.  For some reason everyone who agreed it was going down choose 50% as their expected drop?    The aggregate drop for all my friends and all our ESOP shares was closer to 85-90%.
Another interesting observation.  My circle of friends and associates working in the tech sector mostly worked at 5 big Silicone Valley tech firms.  Of those 5,  two no longer exist,  three are owned by Oracle.  The best recovery off of post burst ATL was 5 to 14,  then Oracle bought for 19.

This whole thread reminds me of early Unix development in Cherry Hill NJ.  There was a huge fight between Dennis Ritchie and Mark Carges about three new features for Unix,  Shared Memory,  Semaphores and Named Pipes.  
Ritchie wanted these new primitives to be accessed via the filesystem namespace,  i.e. 'everything is a file'.
Carges,  who had requested the new features in support of his TUX project,  didn't want the extra overhead of going through the Directory Name Lookup process.  TUX was a high performance transaction engine.
It got heated,  Carges was a strapping younger guy compared to Ritchie,  there was some fist pounding, lots of shouting.  The alternative being discussed was literally a hard fork of Unix:
* easy - everything is a file
* fast - everything isn't a file
Thankfully,  somebody won,  it was Carges.  No hard fork,  big moment for Unix.

Impossible to quantify,  but anecdotally:
The crypto crash from ATH happened close to the holidays,  increasing the chances that day traders got caught long and exposed OVER the new years.  Now they have taxes due on profits made in 2017,  but lost their capital in the crash.  Those people might choose to sell any coins they have,  even at a loss,  to avoid the prospects of additional IRS penalties and late interest.
During the Internet bubble burst one of the biggest nastiest legs down happened late Feb, early March, it was attributed to Tax Selling back then,  but who knows?
I get the feeling there was a LOT more day trading back in 2000-2001,  HODL wasn't a thing.  I think any tax selling has already happened.

Keep things in perspective people.  Remember the Internet Bubble of 2001?  It's so long in the past now that all we have left is memories of what the NASDAQ composite index did.  But that index included all NASDAQ stocks,  which tended to be technology oriented,  but not necessarily Internet related.  That index shows a muted, dampened view to what happened to many individual technology stocks back then.  Many stocks , mostly dot coms,  but other real quality Internet technology stocks,  fell 90% or more off their ATHs when the bubble burst.   Given that the speedy rise of bitcoin's price is an order of magnitude greater that what was common for stocks during the Internet bubble,  a little more of a post crash low percentage wise might not be unreasonable to expect.

Best to distinguish when it went main-stream,  in my mind:
2009 - I read white paper , it had just gone live,  I think bitcoin was &lt; a penny?  maybe &lt; a dollar?  don't remember
2009 - Mt Gox,  I read maybe twice about bitcoin's progress,  I don't remember prices but nothing earth shattering.
Mt. Gox - caught my attention,  read two or three things.
7 months ago - I actually don't remember ,  but I was checking out at my local high end grocery store with 20 something educated checkout dude.  I don't know how he managed to bring it up,  I'm not chatty,  but he gave me the 'have you heard about bitcoin?'.  Before I could respond he got out something about $5000 and $6000,  so I'm guessing bitcoin was $5000 and he said It was going to $6000?  I went through the '87 crash and the 2001 bubble,  so all I said to him is "have you read about tulips?".  I'll never forget his look of total confusion,  his face said  "why the fuck are you talking about tulips?"
Anyway,  that's when bitcoin went mainstream, in my little world.
So I don't care too much what happened to bitcoin prior to a year ago.

It depends on where you sold.  The IRS has compelled Coinbase to turn over records for example.
The IRS will make **no** effort to reconcile the data they get to see OVERALL if you had profit or loss for the year.  They would only do that if they audit you.  The IRS trusts that you will do it correctly and per the law.
So it's the fear of the audit that keeps people honest.  The IRS determines the most potentially lucrative audits by looking at data and running selection algorithms. 
It is a fairly safe assumption that the IRS has already prepared audit selection criteria that involve some aspect of the data they will collect from Coinbase and other Crypto exchanges.
In addition the IRS gets many leads from whistle blowers.
Then there is always the perfectly random audit,  every year some small and totally random percentage of lucky tax payers get a comprehensive audit.

I'm thinking USA only,  I don't know about tax deadlines and such outside of the US.  The IRS already compelled Coinbase to turn over 13,000 accounts (meta information).

People are wondering how the price of bitcoin and all associated alts keeps dropping through perceived 'support',  support being defined as where past money flowed in the most.
When the Internet bubble burst 18 years ago, a roughly 3 month long event,  talking heads on CNBC would always ponder why traditional support wasn't holding.  It wasn't until later in the game that the talking heads figured out it was the high percentage of ESOP shares handed out.  ESOPs had been used for years,  especially in Silicone Valley.  In 1990 ESOPs were only handed out to key employees,  by 1997,   Silicone Valley was really starting to rock,  and most employment offers included stock options.   
Options usually had a vesting schedule,  typically 25% a year,  often it took 4 years of employment to fully vest.  Silicone Valley was an extremely robust investment hotbed since the 70's.  Nothing crazy,  no bubble,  but strong steady growth with the inevitable ups and downs.
Many of the big names that would explode during the bubble had been handing out stock options for years.  Typically the option price was 80% of the market price on the day the employ offer was accepted.  Typically,  if you were granted stock options in a company prior to 1999,  with a strike price of 80% of fair market value,  you became a paper millionaire in 2000. 
Even if you didn't get sign on stock options,  you definitely had access to a 401K and 100% employer match,  with if you put 10% of your income in your companies stock,  the company would kick an equal amount.  If you started worked in Silicone valley in 1990,  put 10% of your income into your company's stock, and they matched 100%,  and that company bubbled,  4 million net worth was not unheard of,  for mid level engineers!
For the most part,  this sudden wealth was unexpected by most.
Well,  today there are no crypto ESOPs,  but there are the developers and very early adopters,  those are the guys who hold a lot of the bitcoin with cost bases way below $7000,  sort of like the unexpected millionaires of 2000.  Like it did 18 years ago,  it's their selling that is blowing away tradition notions of price support

I am referring to the tech bubble that started around 1997 and ended 2001,  commonly referred to as the 'Internet Bubble' at the time.
That bubble was about how to invest in this thing called the Internet.   The first stock to explode during the Internet bubble was Netscape.   People thought,  you really need a browser to use the internet,  so this new company that is IPOing now sells a browser (and a server but no one cared),  so this must be the hot new technology.   That started the Internet bubble.
Hardware stock,  Sun Micro,  Cisco etc.  started bubbling about 6 months later.   Then came the Amazon and eBay IPOs in pretty rapid succession.  When they took off is when the nonsense internet business started,  WebVan.com being my favorite disaster (5 billion raised in an IPO,  evaporated in 18 months).  Pets.com was a favorite because they had a great mascot and good commercials.  
There was never any real examples of people putting 'dot com' at the end of their business name and it doing anything,  just really stupid ideas for businesses built completely around a 'website'.

It's all gone now,  the house,  the sycamore,  top 3 feet of soil, all gone, no trace.  It's no longer buildable,  it will be taken off the property tax roles.

WebVan spent 5 billion dollars on delivery vans and warehouses,  all based on a business model with one simple flaw.  They assumed orders for groceries would be delivered evenly throughout the day.  In fact all of the initial orders were for deliveries at 5:00 pm,  when people got off work.  Turns out they just burnt gas waiting in rush hour traffic,  and throwing away groceries that could not be delivered on time.  It failed so fast it wasn't even funny,  I think they operated like 3 months maybe?

1)  You are supposed to report any profits you made from any trade,  it doesn't matter that they were in a foreign exchange.
2)  If you report ANY kind of investment activity on a 1090,  you have to answer a question to the effect of "did you hold any monies in a foreign account?",  something to that effect.
3) The ONLY way the IRS would ever find out that you had profits in a foreign exchange when you did not declare it is via an audit. 
4)  The IRS randomly audits a low but significant number of tax payers every year.  They do this for two reasons:

I posted this deeper in a comment thread,  it's important so I'll kind of repost up here:
"BTCUSDSHORTS" on Bitfinexis BS and it's not true short selling. It's some synthetic representation of buy interest vs sell interest, total hocum IMHO.
A short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange, and sell it immediately.
You have to give that share back to the exchange at some point. When the price goes down, you buy a share on the open market, return it to the exchange 'covering your short'. You sell high, and buy low so you profit, instead of the reverse, buy low sell high.
* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.
* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share. Only the better exchange clients are approved to short typically.
* Exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.
* The only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees, which in a short sale is a double whammy, the exchange is guaranteed two fees.
Now in the unregulated crypto markets, the exchanges are NOT required to report coins lent for short sale.
Factor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading, (options are NOT short selling). They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option, hence little short interest was observed.
To a professional short seller, little short interest in a market in an obvious speculative bubble was a dream come true, and they borrowed and sold, crashing the market.

Would you modify that belief just slightly?
How about a famous and powerful billionaire and professional short,  cozies up to a handful of overwhelmed new and insanely rich exchange entrepreneurs,  who's shinny new money machines have just recently started seizing up as HODL takes a hold,  say late December 2017.

IRS considers crypto profit capital gains.
They differential between long term capital gains (1+ yr) and short term capital gain (&lt; 1yr)
Losses on an investment are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. Thus, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term capital gains, and long-term losses are deducted from long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted from the other kind of gain.

But since Tom Lee still won't give you the bitter truth, I will.  April 15 WILL NOT end tax selling pressure.   What will happen is a fair amount of true believers WILL NOT sell now to pay their taxes,  they will pay the non payment penalty,  and pay the interest , hoping that their crypto will recover.  In 2001 that created the tax hangover,   look back and look at NASDAQ from April 2001.  My friend was just such a hold out.  He finally sold 7 months AFTER April 15, unwilling to pay the interest any further.

One can only guess,  but I think it's important to focus on what I've always called the professional short,  and I think the CME options is what triggered them,  like sharks smelling blood in the water.

I don't think anything we've seen so far qualifies as a short squeeze.  I would believe that these sharp spikes recently are shorts covering,  but they are in no panic to cover.   Any short positions of significance were likely taken in the mid teens down to maybe 10K,  they are very safe positions.  Every now and then a short decide's they need to cash out,  so they buy, with abandon, to cover their short.
Also,  it is VERY difficult to short bitcoin,  no matter how you try,  there is always some very real risk of a breakdown somewhere in the chain.   The fear of getting stuck in a bad trade due to an exchange failure is too much for many.  Shorting bitcoin,  even at 15K,  takes big balls.

like any asset
you can gift $14,000 to whomever tax free every year
you pay tax on gifts over $14,000 in any one year
when you 'gift',  the asset value transfers at the value on the date of the gift.
the gift receiver would only pay tax on any appreciation AFTER he is gifted and sells asset.
If you give someone $1000 worth of bitcoin,  then 10 years later they sell the bitcoin for $10,000,  THEY would owe long term capital gains tax on $9,000.

Remember Americans,  you do NOT have to pay taxes due on 2017 crypto trades by April the 17th.   You only have to file a tax return.  The Tax return may declare that you owe the IRS,  but if you don't actually send a check,  the IRS assess a penalty,  and starts charging interest.  And that is perfectly legal on your part AND their part.
Ultimately,  you will HAVE to pay all taxes due,  plus any penalties and interest incurred,  or the IRS will f you over.
This is important because  if you:
* owe taxes on 2017 trades
* don't have the fiat to pay
* believe strongly your coins will recover soon
It might be a wise thing to HODL,  and pay the penalty and interest.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:18:04

There is nothing illegal about not paying your taxes so long as you pay the penalty and interest to the IRS.  It happens a lot in bankruptcy proceedings,  large estates that go to probate,  weird stuff like that. 
|Also, how the hell could you spend 30k that fast.
Here is a scenario illustrating to don't have to spend a penny
You buy bitcoin early in 2017 worth $1000
Later it is worth $10,000,  so you do what a lot of early 'traders' did,  sell 10% of your holdings to recoup your initial investment,  and you now have $9,000 in bitcoin profit that is your 'further investment money',  (you think).  So you take your bitcoins and start trading them into alt coins.  Before 2017 ends,  you have a diversified portfolio,  %25 BTC,  10% ??? ....   whatever.
So that means you sold 75% of your bitcoin when you traded it for your alt coin portfolio.
Uncle Sam will tax those sales.
So Now it's 2018,  and you realize you own tax on more than the 10% sale to fiat,  you own tax on the 75% (of the remaining 90%) to traded into alts.
Your tax bill is larger than you expected,  and you don't have the cash to pay those taxes,  so you have to sell NOW regardless,  because you are SO afraid of being in debt to the IRS!

So far,  tax day 2018 is acting just like tax day 2001,  uneventful.  Tax related selling didn't magically stop on April 15 2001 because  it's perfectly legal to hold off actually paying your taxes,  you just accrue penalties and interest. 
If we carry the comparison forward,  the low of the year will occur in early May,  as the reality of further tax related selling weighs on the market.  At some point the final capitulation occurs and after that the slow multi-year crawl.   
Yea,  history does repeat itself

yea I have no idea how to factor that in,  on the one hand the effect is limited to some percentage of the whole market,  but on the other hand that market is so thinly traded,  that trends in a small percentage of the market can move the whole market.  I think it's a wash TBH.
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:37:53
I'll do the math for you:
Say you owe $8,000 in taxes for 2017 and have no fiat to pay.
Say you have 3 bitcoin valued on tax day at $8,000.
Do you sell 1 bitcoin on tax day and pay your tax?
Or do you decide 'my bitcoin will double in one month',  so I'll file and NOT pay for a month.
In one month my taxes due are now 8000 plus 40 (8000 * 0.5)  plus  20.10 (8040 * (.03/12)) or a total of $8060.10.
So bitcoin has doubled in one month,  so I sell 1/2 of a bitcoin to settle up with the IRS,  (I find the $60.10 in the sofa). 
I saved 1/2 bitcoin for a risk of $60.10,  not bad.
All that said,  I personally think this is a terrible risk,  because I don't think bitcoin will go up much at all any time soon.
EDIT:  interest compounds daily,  my crude calculation of $20.10 is slightly low.

It was some kind of international currency arbitrage type operation.  It was maybe 20 guys,  they were totally distracted by a few big screens,  ignoring their little screens on their desks.  Some signs of anxiety,  but, actually I think it just moved the boring meter from 10 down to 7.

I think there is an equilibrium of sorts.  Run of the mill bulls and bears tussle at the current equilibrium,  then a large short is covered,  and the equilibrium is upset,  but eventually returns.
What really sucks for you guys is that one of the most important pieces of information you need to at least have a fighting chance to day trade,  you don't have!  
How many coins have the exchanges lent to short sellers?   How many have been returned (shorts covered)?  How fast is the ratio between the two changing,  etc.  You need to know that if you are going to succeed as a small investor in a big pond with big (shorting) fish.
You don't know because crypto exchanges are not required to report it.   The SEC figured out a long time ago that not reporting short sales was disadvantageous to the small investor,  and they regulated it.   
I have now formed a new opinion,  BTCUSDSHORT on bitfinex (the exchange that recently stepped in major dog doo, another thread),  is an attempt to divert attention away from their short lending practices.   If a noob somehow stumbles across the concept of shorting and asks,  bitfinex has an answer , "short interest,  ah, here's this index we cooked up,  it has the word short in it,  this IS the droid you are looking for!".  It is not.
So ,  there is really no way to predict where things might go, everyone is flying blind.  Also keep in mind,  TA evolved 100% in the age of short sale disclosure requirements.  Applying TA to a market that is not transparent regarding short sales is probably not going to work,  IMHO.
Good luck everyone,  I think you'll need it!

The interest rate on unpaid Federal tax is determined and posted every three months. It is the federal short–term interest rate plus 3 percent. Interest is compounded daily. 
There are certain hodlers that are crunching the numbers right now,  trying to decide to eat the non payment penalty and start paying Uncle Sam daily for the privilege of hodling.    
It will be a bit crazy until the 16th or 17th,  but afterwords,  look forward to continued selling pressure,  the WORST kind,  slow, drawn out, maddening!

Well,  yea,  of course,  because I have no idea, I can't accurately predict the future.  
That is what happened the last time I was involved in a highly speculative bubble that popped very close to the end of the tax year.
And if ya need to somehow try and determine what will happen with the current situation going forward,  why not look back and see what happened in the last similar situation?

no, April 17 (tax day) does not mean bitcoin must rise to prove the dip was tax selling.
think about it,  say you owe $8,000 in taxes because of 2017 trading,  and TODAY you have no fiat and 1 bitcoin.
Do you sell your bitcoin to pay your taxes?
Or do you take Uncle Sam up on his generous offer to let you wait a month,  and pay $60.10 for the privilege?  If bitcoin doubles in one month,  you only have to sell 1/2 your bitcoin to pay your taxes.  
Many will do similar math and take the risk.  That's what happened in 2001.

That is wrong.  The only deadlines in the U.S. are fiscal (Jan 1 - Dec 31) for financial transactions,  then there is the tax filing deadline , this year it is April 17.  
Tax related selling is real.
The sudden end of tax related selling on April 17 is a myth.  The tax hangover due to so many falling into the tax trap will last for months.

At these levels it was late to the party inexperienced shorts getting squeezed.  I'm pretty sure the big money shorts are mostly covered by now.  I actually predicted this about a week or so ago.  Don't mistake this for the next bull run.

Pro shorts still killing the small guy I think.   I think pro shorts made off with your fiat in the initial plunge from ATH to 6k,  I think most covered, but not all. Pro shorts are ballsy.  As the remaining close their large positions, you see these spikes.
But now the newb shorts have arrived, and their panic will add fuel to the fire.

IF YOU BELIEVE it will go up, it was in the bullet points just before that statement.  I don't know if it will double, I personally don't think it will,  but many firmly believe it could,  and may want to take that risk.  So why not talk about it?

The late payment penalty is capped at 25%.  It accrues at 0.5% per month on the balance owed.
The interest is the Federal Reserve Rate plus 3 points,  so now it is about 3%.
You can just pay the interest forever I guess,  if you wanted.

Most shorts conclude the bull runs are over for a long time before they short,  in my experience.  It's the only real risk,  so you have to eliminate it in your mind.  The decision is pretty simple,  which history do you look at to try and decide?   If you use bitcoin's previous history,  you believe a bull run is probably and soon.  If you use the Internet's stock price history,  you believe there are no more bull runs,  just slow (or 0 or neg)  growth.
TL;DR  most shorts are not panicking , don't expect a miracle 'short squeeze'

They have to buy them because they HAVE to return them to the exchange that lent them the coin to short in the first place.

That is NOT what shorting is.   shorting is when you borrow a coin from an exchange with the understanding that you MUST return that coin at some point.
When you have possession of the coin, you sell it, say for $15,000 USD.  Two months later,  you buy a coin on the open market for $7,500 and give it back to the exchange.  You sold high and bought lo and made $7,500.

I was carefully watching the Internet bubble unwind in this timeframe 18 years ago.  I remember that starting on april 1 the NASDAQ's volatility rose until after tax day (15th).   The shorts were launching enormous FUD missiles,  carpet bombing the yahoo message boards.  The FUD missiles were armed with 'tax deadline' warheads.   Whatever the last trading day was before taxes were due,  was a total dud,  nothing much happened.  But the swings BEFORE taxday were wild,  I remember that for sure!
EDIT: wild in 2001 is different than now, wild then is meh now.

neglecting to report is an unknown to me.  In the US,  because the exchanges were compelled to turn over a list of their top transactors,  and the IRS is so omnipotent,  my guess is compliance will be 'normal', only the crazy fringe would try and get away with not reporting.  
So what I'm referring to are those that sold some BTC in 2017,  and because of the crash,  have to sell more BTC to pay taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:44:41
I just read the 'Manipulation Cartel' post from 4 days ago.  It seems a loopy conspiracy to me.  Could it be that exchanges have been loaning shares to short sell,  and are not reporting it?   It would fit the events.  Options trading launches,  very little action,  but NO OBVIOUS SHORT INTEREST,  that would be blood in the water to a pro short, especially bitcoin.  Never in history did so many pro shorts pop a chubby at the same time!

It's BS and it's not true short selling.  It's some synthetic representation of buy interest vs sell interest,  total hocum.
A short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange,  and sell it immediately.
You have to give that share back to the exchange at some point.  When the price goes down,  you buy a share on the open market,  return it to the exchange 'covering your short'.  You sold high,  and bought low so you profit,  instead of the opposite,  buy low sell high.
* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.
* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share.  Only the better ecchange clients are approved to short typically.
* exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.
* the only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees,  which in a short sale is a double whammy,  the exchange is guaranteed TWO fees.
Now in the unregulated crypto markets,  the exchanges are NOT required to do anything!
Now factor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading,  (options are NOT short selling).  They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option,  hence LITTLE SHORT interest was observed.
To a professional short seller,  little short interest in a market in an obvious speculative bubble was a dream come true,  and they borrowed and sold, crashing the market.

The people who sell due to taxes are those that have fallen into the 'tax trap'.  I don't know how many crypto investors have fallen into a tax trap in 2017.   In 2000 because of the Internet stock crash,  it was probably 10% , a rough guess based on how many people I knew who day traded in 2000 and who got stuck in a tax trap.  
The tax trap is actually pretty easy to fall into when an asset bubble crashes so close to the fiscal year change.
