Dont worry, there wont be alot of new people buying bitcoin, its times are over
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:49:51
Haha okay. I see you really know a lot about this market.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:39:54
And eventually your btc is worth 0 because the world runs out of clueless investors that blindly throw money into bad tech...
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:40:33
Alright, crypto pro! Remindme! 2 months

That comparison is straight wrong... If there is better technology, why would the old, worse technology continue to be used. There is nothing, bitcoin is doing better than another cryptocurrency and you dont need bitcoin to develop something else.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:04:44
Technically, bitcoin isnt that decentralized at all...
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:22:05
What about the new currencies that are already out? Vertcoin or Litecoin for example? Faster transactions and cheaper transactions, btc is just way too overhyped, idk how you dont see this
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:27:13
Probabl nothing, because nobody can sell. Or buy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:05:27
Yes, and for that purpose there are FAR better alternatives already, making bitcoin actually obsolete. The only reason its gaining value is because of people that dont know better.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:26:23
I somehow get the feeling that you are able to lose money, no matter what you invest in.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:43:40
In case of a financial crisis like in 2008, i think crypto would moon. In case of a global Desaster like ww3, crypto would become completely worthless.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:20:28
Bitcoin is nowhere near as decentralized as some of the other cryptos though.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:23:20
Well, you either get lucky, or you learned your first lesson. Id say the latter, but either way: good luck and congratz on your jump into crypto!
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:10:04
Tbh, it is extremely likely that you will see a lower price than what it is now, during the next couple days or weeks. Id either wait, or put some of the money in vtc or some similar asic resistant coin. Just dont buy all now, ive done that mistake too many times, if youre investing for a longer period of time, space your investments out

This. Bitcoin gets its value from its brand, other coins get their value from their tech. Once crypto gets noticed and used by the public and people need a usable coin, btc WILL eventually vanish.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:24:02
no, not at all. The only reason btc is still a thing, is its brand. People that get into crypto only know of bitcoin at first. People that arent into crypto only know bitcoin. From a technical point of view aswell as from an actual use case view, btc is one of the worst coins there are. Most of the newer coins have far lower fees aswell as a lot faster transaction times. Im not hating on bitcoin, but its technology is just obsolete. Please just take an objective look at the entire subject and dont try to confirm your own opinions.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:29:54
No. The avarege person cant mine btc profitable, 95%+ of btc is being mined by a couple big farms. Coins like VTC or GRS can be easily mined by anybody with a gpu without spending more money on electricity than you get in coins.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:04:28
not really...
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:33:27
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:32:20
True that ��
Sorry then
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:38:48
To be honest, i dont think youll get the btg if you had your coins on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:31:15
Well, guess i was right then? Lol. Nah, i meant to say 5k. But looking at it now, i could see a realistic point somewhere around 5,2k. But i have to idea what im talking about, its just a number that sounds good to me, and i personally will buy btc, when vertcoin hits at least 10$.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:57:46
This is just the beginning of the dip, it will probably drop below 6k usd, but dont rely on my word.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:58:08
Id rather go all in on Vertcoin at the moment. But that being said, you shouldnt go all in on anything. Id be looking at something like this: 40% VTC; 30% BTC; 30% ETH
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:59:18
Because, in theory it is better than bitcoin and even better than litecoin, and even has a lower circulating supply than litecoin, wich is already priced over 50$. LOTS of development is getting on in this coin: ledger support, tor waller, stealth adresses, its asic resistant etc. Also, theres a halving in december. Im extremely confident that this coin will reach 50$ + in 2018, you should really look into it and research it!
