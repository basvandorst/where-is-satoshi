You’re never going to be able to predict the market. Do yourself a favor- put that investment in a hardware wallet and forget about it.

Do you mean investing practices? All I can say is don’t invest any more than you’re willing to lose. Way more risky than regular stocks. I’m no expert but I bought the ledger because it was more affordable. The unit itself is the most basic wallet you can buy but it gives you the security you need. The other wallet I looked at was trezor.

My wife went from not wanting me to invest in my own employee stock plan at work to asking "when are we rich?" when I bring up btc investments ;)

In the Stock Tip episode Jerry panic sells and George committed to HODL. The stock jumped soon after Jerry sold and George made off well.

Is everyone going to sell at $5K again?

I started investing 1 week ago. Everything is down this weekend since I bought, but it's been a lot of fun so far! Best of luck to you.

Is there short/long term capital gains tax when selling crypto? 
Does coinbase provide a tax document similar to something eTrade produces when taxes are due?
Thanks for the info so far!

Doesn’t selling crypto for USD put you on the hook for capital gains tax? Putting in your bank account doesn’t really have anything to do with insuring capital gains tax. Unless you are trying to hide from the government.

Are you saying that you get zero fees when you do a limit buy?
