Same old story. Gold was invented by some mysterious character called God and apparently he's still got most of it buried somewhere.

Yes, you're right
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:31:14
Yes, I don't see why this can't be done and comply with KYC and AML.
The fact of the matter is that at the moment somebody is earning 2-3% for credit card purchases and huge fees on all types of money transfer. Bitcoin would not take all of this because many consumers would still want reversible transactions to protect themselves but it would take a chunk of the financial institutions profits and give it to bitcoin miners and consumers.

 conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest will ruin the credibility of any supposed impartial body. 
statements like this won't really help.

I think that handing each other little metal discs and pieces of paper has been superseded by technology.
 How long is it before a pound or a dollar is available in a virtual format? 
 I'm not bothered about anonymity. I'm only buying coffee and newspapers and stuff. I'll use altcurrencies for anonymity.
 I just can't be bothered with cash jangling about in my pocket and checking change when I could do everything from a digital wallet on my phone.
 The technology is there. Why not use it?

The AML/KYC excuse is not valid (bullshit)
There is no difference between a bank account and a bitcoin address if they are registered to an individual.
 I can deposit a huge amount of unexplained cash into my bank account. To comply, the bank has to ask where it came from. They can do the same with a registered bitcoin account.

I'm selling bitcoins. 1BTC each. PM me or contact me through GoSMS.

So it's a small step to make the dollar a virtual currency. When people see bitcoiners spending by reading QR codes with their phones they will ask why they can't spend their dollars that way. US treasury works out it's cheaper to give out dollars this way and easier to track as well as security benefits to sell it to the public. It is a crypto currency because they will use the same cryptography to secure their (government registered?) wallets. It's easy to have a gradual transition because you can have both virtual and physical currency and swap between the two no problem. I do think it is ironic that bitcoin could cause complete government control over cash transactions considering the ideology behind its development.

Bitcoin becomes the catalyst for virtual national currencies. Governments suddenly have much more control. Irony?
 Technology has definitely moved beyond the need for bits of paper and metal coins, how long before we catch up with it?
 Also the digital or virtual  dollar will solve the problem of bitcoin/fiat exchange.

I'm not being facetious. I'm a genuine scammer looking for opportunities.

Bitcoin does threaten the business model of banks and financial institutions that make unreasonable fees from money transfers. 
 The excuses relating to KYC and AML are not valid. Any financial institution could accept fiat/bitcoin transfer and comply with all existing regulation. They simply have to associate the wallet bitcoin addresses with known customers. Transferring money to and from a bitcoin wallet is then no different to transferring money from to and from a bank account.
