Ah didn't know that. Do you any website that implement the tag? I haven't found any yet.
EDIT: Yes, Brave has a built-in wallet.

Love that.
Ok, so we have Bitcoin/Blockchain tech. And I agree with you that there are two types of Bitcoin/Blockchain users:
1. The Coinbase users
2. The Bitcion user (as you mention who interacts w/ the protocol, keeps his keys…)
Do you think this is a temporary state?
In another post I wrote that in the long-term Blockchain could be different than we imagined it. We imagine it as completely free, decentralize etc. But w/ "harmful" activities like Ponzis (think Fomo3D), ICO-scams… we see that some "censorship" would be good and that because of that in the long-run  Blockchains will be different than we imaged (not full free anymore…).
What's you opinion on that? Do you think that we will ever have a world where we have only the real Bitcoin users, will we end up in a hybrid stage (Coinbase users + Bitcoin users) or will Coinbase and Co. shift the technology into the less "ideal" version?

True. But some of these fees are also network fees.

I agree. In the long-term it might be completely different and my thinking in the article focuses a lot on the old world. Indeed, I am just realizing that the article contains a lot of the "it has always been like this, therefore it will be like this in the future as well".
Cool, thanks for making me realize that.


Assuming that Coinbase gets there first, do you think that they could acquire a first-mover advantage so strong that any other technology (e.g. BTC) regardless how good it is, won't be accepted?

I agree that Coinbase is far away from what cryptocurrencies are supposed to be. But they have still done a lot to get them to the mainstream.

Not sure what you mean. Could you please explain?


But don't you think that we will somebody who takes care about all the other stuff beyond payments?
Thanks for the comment, btw.
