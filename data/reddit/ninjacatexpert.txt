I didnt read the article, but if they stored important files/information at one place (PC) without any backups... I would recommend the person in charge to reconsider the overall IT situation. (mildly expressed)

I know exactly what kind of process he went through! My friend mentioned Bitcoin in our economy lecture around March 2013 and i recall how ridicioulus the word "Bitcoin" sounded. When i asked him further about it he never stopped talking. At some point i got annoyed... 
Well exams where over, i had free time, researched a bit,  installed Multibit out of curiosity. Got some satoshis by scavenging free faucets, sent them from one wallet to another and BAM! 
For me it was the feeling of control and not depending on someone else to transmit value as well as the knowledge nobody can take it from me (Those who ever experienced an account you depend on being not accessable can probably relate). I thought "this is huge!"
After observing the community and reading endless amounts of articles, i see ppl having ideas, developing solutions for problems i never thought of!
Its truly amazing and i keep getting excited about it like my friend that introduced it to me.

"I do not have the bitcoins...", if there only would be a way to verify if someones owns an amount of bitcoin before doing a trade...

An interesting point would be how it will affect the content being posted when money is involved. What would be the bits per upvote threshold which makes ppl adapt their comment to fit majority opinion (un- or intentionally). This could make a nice research topic...
