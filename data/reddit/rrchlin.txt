buy whatever you can afford to save and lose.
For instance.. $300 I bought last week is now $340. 
$40 in its own is nothing to brag about.. but that's on top of the $300 I was already putting away.
I'm definitely willing to gamble a meaningful to me but meager savings in the grand scheme with this. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:07:26

It would be. Followed by months of gains maybe half-way to the moon.

Home and vehicle for everyone is feasible. If you're renting because you can't a home mortgage loan or can't afford a mortgage, you're failing.
I know people that are very lucky to have a mortgage because the price of rent has skyrocketed and they wouldn't be able to afford to rent.

@_date: 2017-12-06 04:53:46
I'm sorry Im not sure what substantial transactions mean.
I'm just saying.. when is it worth having over having cash? Like when its $10 million and no gains left. I understand for traveling out of the country and dark web.. I can't think of any other reasons right now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:03:36
idk I read someone mentioning the high high price of BTC + futures, being good for using Bitcoin as a payment system.
Like the price of $500 of BTC won't fluctuate that much if its hovering $60k for a length of time. And going from $60k to $65
Sorry guys.. bad at math or I'd give a good example of the prices.

Go be a financial advisor for someone else.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:32:40
too many fees to make any gains like that and also..
$100 invested at $15,000, you'll need to see $30,000 to see $200
If you're dealing with $1,500 at $15k a coin, the price will need to shoot up $1000 to profit $100. And once ou pull the $100 out, it will need to shoot up another $1000 to make the 2nd $100. 
You can definitely do it but I'd expect to blow some gains to learn.

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:32
I tried to buy BTC first at $15 for its intended purpose. I had no idea of it being valued at $0.05 or reaching $1 and onto $15. It hit $100 and I wasn't interested anymore. I had made it to one of the TOR sites and thought it was crazy neat. I just had no interest in purchasing anything. 
We're gonna have to get off this run and settle a price for it to be useable again. Outside of black market and international travel, what are its best uses?

If that's the case.. I think it could definitely go a lot higher. Its cliche to say $100k but that's the roof on this current ride I think people are banking on. Maybe it crashes at $30k to $10k and don't die.

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:42:30
gotcha. I definitely agree. Ultimate FOMO is to not lock in your gains. 
I'm happy with my life. Bitcoin is only a small piece of it and I wouldn't make "crazy profit" if I cashed out today. So I'll just HODL and spread the word and learn. Would def sting if it crashed, but not ruin me.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:54:04
I had to read /g/ to learn of bitcoin. You know how much time that took to get there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:28:07
I too thought it wasn't even worth it for years. Each new ATH thinking I missed the boat. When I learned of BTC at $15 I wasn't even aware of bitcoin opening trades at .05cents or people mining thousands worth less than that.
Now an entire coin is such a big deal and pessimists (myself included) rolled their eyes at people investing $200 into BTC at $10k. Like yeah.. if it goes to the moon ($20k in get rich quick thinking) your $200 is worth $400.. big deal.
Think about the long term and if it really takes off. Someday a dollar might only get you 100 satoshis. This is purely speculation of course. And a dollar might get you 100,000 satoshis.

shakedown is a good way to put it. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:47
remember the market is exponential. so if you're only buying .010 of a coin, $13k compared to $16k is only $130 vs $160. It is a lot of money but we're planning on the moon. So still small potatoes. Just keep buying. 
Trying to time the market at these prices as an amateur is hard and in the long run $10k, $13k, $15k, $17 and $20k is really nothing if this thing takes off. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:59:25

EDIT: If I re-enter the market in a new trade and lose, I have the box-truck and original profit. That would mean I won on my 1st trade and lost on my 2nd. 
Keeping it all mixed up as 1 trade may be a newbie investor mistake. IDK. I'm not an investor.

@_date: 2017-12-08 06:22:08
this says HODL. bitcoin is a long term game if your a "late early adopter" Say if you bought at $7,500, was the end goal really to just double that? 
Definitely can make or lose a few quick bucks day trading but that's really gambling. Do it if you want to.

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:16:51
6500 satoshis for a $1 right now. Don't get hung up on not being able to afford an entire coin. No one knew bitcoin would go from a nickel to $15k
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:11:15
Even a satoshi may be valued at $1 usd in the years to come. I think you can get like 6,500 for $1 usd now.
New ICOs might seem tempting since you believe you're getting a full coin. But 6,500 satoshis for a buck sounds like an oppurtunity you can't afford to pass up on.

Then let's just hodl brother. Think of your entry point and think about losing half its value maybe. You ok with HODLING that? 
Who knows where you will be when the price jumps thousands in a day. I watched it jump from 16-17-18-19k at work the other day with no way to buy or sell.
The end all goal is to force everyone to sell their coins and let the price skyrocket is what I'm getting out of this thread. Selling now and rebuying back in a week is riskier than HODLING probably.

my stepfather was telling me how banks were running some crazy interest rates back in the day.
they would basically loan a bank $100,000 for a year or 2 and get back $12,000 at the end of a year or 2.
Then they got conned into doing $200,000 which was over the limit back then I guess and the bank was shut down and most of the money gone.

@_date: 2017-12-09 02:56:52
the way I see it.. even as its hot. if it shoots up, you profit and then have to deal with what you want to do with the original $5,000. Or if it tanks, you might be willing to settle at a $1500 or $3000 loss.. but not the full $5k

I googled bitcoin immutability. I do not understand what it has to do with the value of a 6500 satoshis (which I agree is against the rules as it refers to the market price)
Claiming 6500 satoshis is impossible to transfer because of fees is not the point neither. That's like saying nothing cost a penny or you can't buy a single kwh.

The new ATH everyday was exciting but probably not good for stability. I understand though at a high high price like $1million. A couple thousand dips here and there hardly effects the price of $20 worth
edit: Also open to buying back in. who knows. as of today with a declining price, I'd rather lock in a gain and go back into the market in a new position.

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:11
If they had an effect on $5k-$19k, then they could control the market a bit. The end all goal is to get your BTC out of this then. If they're gonna tank the market, do you thin they want it to stay crashed and lose the honeyhole?
Think of how much money they could make if it drops to $10k and buy back at that price and it rockets to $30k

I pulled some profits out of BTC and now standing in a new jacket i preach to everybody how I am the smartest. Only I know what is best for me and my money I tell them. I ask them all who has ever given them good advice lmao I let them run on their little tidbit story to prove my point before cutting them off and bringing attention back to me. 
Now they want BTC and I tell them its too risky. I've cashed out. I'm in the real world now with cash money trying to work LMAO. I'm very serious about my finances now. Setting up a payment plan on an ER visit I just had with no insurance.
I joke and they all know me. But this is true. I followed BTC for a long time without buying any. After a small profit, I have seen the light. I may have reached my moon and it was just locked up inside me the whole time. 
I don't even need any more gains.. but I am money hungry. I bought BTC on credit card and sold/transferred and hold the extra cash now. 
I talk about bribing and paying everybody all day. I'd like to bribe my boss to never schedule me for work again so I get unemployment all year. I took a bet on a football game for the exact score of 30-23 (sure shit lost) I fedexed cash to my brother like in one of those wallstreet movies. Even chit-chatted it up and joked about jail with the clerk.

Not to say that you're swinging the market but with $1,000 gains everyday come hype and new buyers. Once it levels off for a few days, half new buyers start to get nwrvoys and sell dipping the price a little.

talked to some tech people today. they were out of the loop. at $15 the concept was cool to me. At $17k, it can still serve the same purpose as putting $15 in for "internet money".
The idea of HODLIN a wallet and messing up/your money gone forever is tough for people to grasp though. It's not like cash where you can accidentally hand someone too much $$$ and notice and correct it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:32:47
If you could still join at $8k, you can still join at $20k. Just take longer.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:34:16
yeah at $15 and on I have always been aware of the price and didn't buy any until $5k

before you guys go out for the dinner.. just pop open the screen and tell them "just give me a sec." and as you're getting up, give a look of I'm really concerned and busy, but I'll put it aside for dinner with my parents.
Your mom will take the hint and you tell her "nah we're going to dinner". she'll be so proud. 
really you were just HODLIN and checking to see if it was gonna break the $19990 sell wall
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:09
the exponential gains really got people hooked. And lets face it.. as long as you were willing to cut your losses, no harm in putting in more than you could afford to lose.
Just because I put in $5000 does not mean I MUST watch it dip to $1000. I can sell it at any time.

I understand. Would sure be nice to dump some though with no regrets.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:21
6500 satoshis = $1 roughly right now. 
If bitcoin hits $1million that $1 will be $65. 
$50 would be $3,250.
May not sound much when you look at it under $100,000 a coin but with exponential growth, $50 weekly could really add up.

I did that once at one of the breweries in Milwaukee. In my current truck I went rock crawling at Dunkin Donuts recently.

@_date: 2017-11-22 02:32:07
none of that has any value to common people like my family.
best way to put it is to explain that bitcoin is what it is.. whether you belive in it or not, it can be used as an investment.. and whether it wins (moon) or fails (crash), the blockchain technology behind it is the future payment system
Am I correcT? That's kind of how I put it

I learned of bitcoin at $15 and it sounded very interesting and I wanted to try the silk road out for no purpose other than to try it. And the darkweb was very interesting. (I think silk road was down at the time, could only get to blackmarket reloaded)
I thought it was kind of like the Folding project (forget what exactly it was called) with the PS3 and for generating cancer cells/fighting them. 
I ended up not giving all my credentials to MT.Gox and talked a friend into buying at $1k and didn't buy any myself. 
At this point the only reason for me to buy it is for the fear of missing out and to get rich. I don't have any legitimate uses for it other than to sit my money in it and hope it grows. 
It's also nerve racking to protect your wallet if you're not so tech savy. After I purchased what I did on the exchange.. I was getting weird spam phone calls that scared the shit out of me.. And I couldn't trust my security.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:19:39
my little sister used to have a gimmicy dumb phone that was shaped like a microphone sorta. it would give you a headache in seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:38:24
I bought and sold at $5500 because I don't trust myself to EVEN SEND TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS.
I didn't buy $50 worth at $15 because MTGOX wanted a scan of my I.D. and I scanned my passport I.D. and it looked soo damn good on my monitor on full-screen.
Saying "if you fuck up an address, you lose your money" and that being acceptible is very risky for folks. After having .9 bitcoin and freaking out my brother said "there's noone to hold your hand" and I really freaked out.

those prices were obviously illegitimate. I think it shows proof of things to come. Also remember if everyone HODLED at $1k, price would of never spiked to $5k, $10k and on.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:02:38
I count it in hundreds and thousands.
At $10k its a lot more stable at small amounts though. It would be easier to count in millionths if the price was stable

Same i have a buddy who was up a large amount (unrealized) and he acts like everyone else is a low life for "making a quick buck". 
I see btc as an investment opportunity and a way to make a quick buck but the price doesnt matter much for its real world usage as long as its stable. And i believe it will be much higher if its used again. 
This buddy of mine has no intention to use btc or sell.

bro I don't have a formal tech background and didn't go to college. I ran a .com site when I was 12 for fun and learned of bitcoin at $15. I did not buy. 
Every few years Ill go into a new serious hobby. I learned to hunt and traveled the states from 18-21 learned to play guitar at 21 and went full blown mechanic sometime after. Mostly innto cars now. Always something new to learn. I wish I would of learned how to code but maybe someday I will. For now its not a top priority.
