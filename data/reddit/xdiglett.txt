Love how the article doesn't cite any sources, just seems to be clickbait

Never said it is a problem, just explaining how people lose their coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:22:08
Yeah, just transfer it to GDAX and withdraw. No fees :)

Who wouldn't be happy when something that they believe in hits 10k?

You should quit. Never go all in, never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Some people get scammed because they're unaware of what they're doing. They paste their private keys in every website possible trying to get more.

It's flooding with orders atm.

The IRS considers precious metals a “collectible” for income tax purposes. Gains on collectibles held for less than one year are taxed as ordinary income - the same tax treatment as short term capital gains. Gains on collectibles that are held for more than one year are treated as long term and taxed at a maximum rate of 28%.
Sell any form of precious metal at a profit and the profit will be taxed at a federal rate of 28% or less. Sell any form of precious metal at a loss and it will be used to offset any capital gains you have.
