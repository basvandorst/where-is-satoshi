Hi Stephanie :)

Good rule of thumb: If you don't read given subreddit frequently - don't post.

Using your child to make business doesn't seem right to me.
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:25:22
You Sir, have no idea what are you talking about.
I would start with reading the white paper. Then slowly go through the process of not typing while thinking intensively. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:22:08
But these are customers bitcoins? Or bitcoins offered for sale? Since you're not really an exchange right? Some more explanation would be nice.

I liked the first part, but what's wrong with Bruce Fenton?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:59:09
I love the idea, but you need to think of something to make it exciting.
First episode was super exciting, but doing the same thing every time won't work. If it's gonna be just taking clothes off, it would have to be a different girl each time.

No worries Stephanie :)

You are not doing your school assignment.
You are looking for somebody to do it for you.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:44:02
So why did you remove it OP?
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:41:10
Um, yeah, you may want to re-read that white paper.
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:34:32
The point is that this is a legal announcement and they are based in Japan.
@_date: 2014-10-07 07:44:31
Thanks for the reply. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:20:05
Sometimes I wonder if your are a troll or just stupid.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:07:40
the other side also opens and it's in english
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:09:43
I so hope it's about hoverboards. This would make everything else irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:04:48
It's not bad, but since it's an international call I'd much prefer just seeing that the line is busy.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:53:07
Proof that bitcoin will be huge: my grandma is on facebook.
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:20:22
Why doesn't he make a bet on some reputable site and put 100BTC+ on one side like a real man?
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:38:44
So what's the best way to buy precious metals for bitcoins **in europe**? 
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:39:17
Yeah, this blockchain thing... everybody can see the money... not so great.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:22:59
I don't see the solution to the problem. If he randomly selects from available nodes then attacker will just spawn millions of nodes.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:19:15
It has two zeros in it. Zero symbolizes future price of dollar.

looks like you missed the gif
edit: [found it]( but I don't have a screenshot

Any idea why WizSec doesn't provide https? Especially given what they are doing, and that there is a donation address at the bottom of the page.
