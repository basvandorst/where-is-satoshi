Based on their success/failure with this beta test I would assume they will probably integrate with other exchanges...

Several good points below related to tax issues and using the Shift Visa Card.... Does Coinbase have any advice or guidance regarding tax consequences? 
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:18:18
I completely expected and appreciate your comment but here is the current state of options when shopping at Lowes:
1)  Use a regular VISA credit card
2)  Use SHIFT VISA debit card linked to Coinbase account.
For now, option 2 is the clear winner and it also sends a signal through the marketplace that bitcoin backed credit cards are a viable consumer product.  Eventually other banks catch on and offer their versions of bitcoin linked credit cards (maybe with lower fees).... then the merchants finally start to see the light and say "look at all these customers paying with these bitcoin backed credit cards, why don't we just accept bitcoin and bypass the fees and bank middlemen"   supports comment from Defusion55 above....... it takes time and it seems painfully slow but these small steps are moving bitcoin in the right direction.

good point, that's why an arbitration market for bitcoin would thrive in this marketplace.  All transactions could require 3 (or more) signatures.  1 sig for Buyer, 1 sig for Seller, and 1 sig for Arbitrator.

I've got a work around to my OP that I would like to propose.  What do you think of the example format below for  Craigslist Post?
2006 Honda Acura for sale $5500 (฿ accepted)
By adding the "(ฺ฿ accepted)" to the Title this would add a tremendous amount of visibility to Bitcoin and start people asking what is the ฿ symbol.
Any ideas how to create a movement within Craigslist to use this format?
I totally agree that Open Bazaar is the future of Bitcoin but I'm interested in improving the here and now awareness of Bitcoin and Craigslist (in the U.S) has millions of users passing cash back and forth on a daily basis.  Instead of cash, let the CL community use bitcoin but they first have to be educated and the first step is to build awareness through a brand symbol.
The ฿ symbol is the Thai Bhat but I can't find anything closer.....
Thanks for all the posts on this thread and great feedback.
Inch by inch, Bitcoin will eventually dominate.  Building awareness is the first step.

Precisely!  95% of Craigslist transactions are cash thus restricting it's primary use to local markets.  Type bitcoin into a Craigslist search and you will already find a small but growing number of listings accepting bitcoins (written in the description of the ad)....  I want a BTC logo placed next to each listing as well as a filter as previously mentioned in thread.  This will really drive awareness and ultimately adoption of bitcoin on a large scale.  Anyone have stat's on how many $ are transacted on CL?  I bet its 7 figures.

Steve Jobs would have embraced Bitcoin and built a wallet into every mac that ships.  He loved revolutionary technologies that were not endorsed by "big brother", however he also liked closed systems... Hmmm what do y'all think, would Jobs be for or against bitcoin?

Sorry...my wife has already told me no wet t-shirts contest in the backyard.   I'm glad this proof of concept has already sparked a new idea!   
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:16:19
Thanks for the good feedback!   Live voting or crowd feedback has some really interesting potential....  
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:29:50
That was me as I almost got dunked!  I thought,  what are the odds someone will send btc as I'm under the bucket..... the odds are better than I assumed
@_date: 2015-10-29 00:25:38
Donald is live and ready to be dunked... send a small amount of bitcoin and water will fill a bucket above his head and dump him now!  
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:04:09
Great idea!  On a similar note, we have been approaching different zoos to see if they would allow us to install a feeding bucket in one of their live cams, thus anyone in the world could, for example, feed the penguins sardines, feed the monkeys bananas, etc....  it raises money for the zoo, increases site/park visitors, and bitcoin now has another use....... what excites us most is that this project could not have been done (or at least not easily)  with USD..... because bitcoin is natively digital, creating applications like this bucket splash is simple, secure, and very inexpensive.... our average donation on this site is currently $0.24    Try sending $0.24 in USD anywhere across the internet...  I know I'm preaching to the choir but building applications that allow people to experience interactions not possible with USD is just another step towards launching bitcoin to the moon.

we typically see a delay of approx 2-3 seconds... not sure why you experienced a 1 minute delay.  What is your download speed?
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:33:00
thanks for testing out the concept!

thanks for feedback... agreed the background music is way too loud
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:10:43
Great thoughts!   I like dunking the politicians idea.... what if the next debate we could get Trump, Sanders and Clinton to stand under the 3 buckets.... the world gets to decide in real time who is the best qualified... don't like their comment... no problem they get dunked...  Interesting thought experiment.... could this somehow be used to gather "wisdom of the crowds" ?  
@_date: 2015-10-23 02:00:01
Thanks so much for the great feedback!  It's really appreciated after alot of work to get this live.   Is there anything I can do to improve the reddit post to that it gains more traction?  Better title?
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:17:40
1) The water is real, the bitcoin is real, Mr. Trump is well not so real
2)  They didn't have a choice.... kinda like we don't have much of a choice in who becomes president
3)  I kinda like Ben but I'll leave my personal libertarian feelings out of this....
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:46:11
there should only be a few second delay in the donation history.... you might need to refresh your screen..... we only display the last 5 donations..... but a complete history can be found at blockchain.info   gotta love bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-10-28 14:30:50
Just got Trump and Carson setup....  they are just props until the "real" candidates go live at 6:00pmCST tonight!

Really appreacite the feedback guys and helping us out.... good points on the QR codes...... will add some text to "click here to make QR bigger"..... Cheers!

Sorry about that... i just changed the camera angle which should be better
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:35:24
So True!  I just ordered 3 Halloween masks (Trump, Carson and Fiorinia)  I'm going to have 3 people in masks standing under the buckets on Wednesday night.  When they say something you don't like dunk away..... it would be great if we could get this to go viral..... people apathetic to bitcoin would want to obtain bitcoin just to participate..... 
what do ya'll think?  I'll have the demo ready by Tuesday 11/27 for your thoughts....
We REALLY appreciate everyone's comments on this thread and thanks for the support!

Add a new dimension to the debates tonight.  Use bitcoin to splash Donald Trump OR Ben Carson if you don't like a comment.  Stand in cutouts are live now for your practice but at 6:00pmCST we will have "real" candidate for you to splash at [Ucontrol.TV](
