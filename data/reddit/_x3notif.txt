It's not a realistic possibility, that's what I'm trying to say. Short of someone funding the development and construction of their own mining hardware en masse, for the purpose of attacking the network kamikaze style. A 51%+ attack with public pool wouldn't be sustainable without initially having at least 80% of the network.
That said, even a brief 51%+ attack with a pool would cause a great loss in confidence. 
Yet the cost of mounting a 51%+ attack is not worth it. What motivation is there for such an attack? I find it very difficult to imagine people with immense amount money to burn, who would want to attack the network in such a manner.
If I was capable enough and had the desire to mount a 51%+ attack, while attempting to profit from it, this is how I would try do it:
First, fund the development and construction of mining hardware
Second, covertly enter short positions backed by billions of dollars.
Third, attack the network on a holiday and when the market is overbought.
Fourth, after the attack, and after the market has crashed, take profit from the short positions.
Fifth, use the mining hardware to mine bitcoin and other coins.

Many would leave those two pools if they were ever to cooperate in an attack. Any attack on the network wouldn't be sustainable this way. Yet irrational fear runs rampant, as it always does.

In many ways these events are beneficial to bitcoin, as the economy has to adapt sooner or later. The less libertarian extremists there are, the better, I say. They're far too fanatical. 
I think that $500 - $1,000 might a bit farfetched. Those of us who didn't sell are the ones who missed out on a chance to buy lower.
(Of course libertarians are going to down vote this because I mention that libertarians are getting in the way.)

That's the thing, individual miners do not create the bitcoins, the network does, and it rewards the miner for solving the mathematical problem. It's largely equivalent to the mining of gold, the gold isn't created by the miner, it's a product of the miner's efforts. 
And it would be the pools that would be considered the money transmitters, if anybody.
I feel that these regulations were intended for another purpose, and that they shouldn't apply here.

Yeah, I guess it doesn't matter if the market has been working just fine so far without people reportedly getting busted, they would cover that up now wouldn't they? Or perhaps they're just waiting? It totally just makes sense that they're collecting inconclusive data to bust everyone at a later date, all throughout the world. Makes perfect sense. Let them have their illegal things for now... The authorities will have the last laugh in the end.
They're real gems alright, these authorities, who ever thought they were incompetent?
Even if exit relays are not needed for onion sites (the onion site is essentially the exit node itself), they probably have a huge zero-day exploit that breaks the privacy of Tor, that the Tor Foundation told the NSA about first before they go about fixing.

I'm not saying it's right or wrong 50% of the time, but it could be. What I'm saying is that it could be worse. An indicator could be right only 10% of the time. If you have another indicator that agrees that the price is likely to rebound, while it is near where a fibonacci line is, you can likely assume that line is where it does. Fibonacci retracement just tells you where possible resistances and supports are.

Separate addresses alone only offer privacy for the time until they're are used.
You can maintain some privacy if you keep addresses separate from each other, and avoid spending from two or more addresses in one transfer, or else they will get batched together. Some payment processors use gateway addresses to add privacy.
It is recommended to use separate addresses for security reasons, not privacy.

The bitcoin client without the GUI is a lot like the kernel for linux. You can use the command line part of the client with other coding languages, to do pretty much anything you want. Though a plugin implementation might be a neat idea to add to the interface part of the client. For now instead, there's several different bitcoin clients out there, some of which do some unique things, yet they all depend on the original kernel part of the Satoshi client. You can think of these clients as linux distros. These clients do not yet have and equivalent to apt-get, but perhaps they will eventually.

If the Bitcoin Foundation does something that is generally bad for the community of bitcoin, and they become unwilling to undo that, people will either migrate away and lose faith, or fork their own chain. There's reasons why the client is open source and does not auto update, that they get paid in bitcoin, and that there exists alternative crypto-currencies.
I personally see no problem whatsoever with the Bitcoin Foundation as it is now. There's not much to corrupt, unlike there is with government.
Yet I do hope that one day that the Bitcoin Foundation will not be needed, and that there becomes nothing left to develop for the core client.
Ultimately we fear others having control and want control our self, at least over ourselves. We fear the unknown.

Perhaps they did do a cost analysis, but not likely one that accounts for the future adoption of bitcoin, or one that accounts for the positive media attention that they would get from it. It wouldn't be that big of a hassle to use a payment processor like Coinbase or Bitpay, but they might think that it would be.
Also keep in mind that this request is from 2011, they likely noticed it before the regulation events. They may have noticed it even before the hyper mania. Yet no word back from them yet. Usually they respond to suggestions.

I think it's more like they're confident they won't get caught. They've taken their precautions. In the same way The Pirate Bay have taken theirs at times. It's not so much the attitude that you should look at, it's the kind effort they put into it, and the staff's personalities, their views, and goals. For instance, would they really bother adding litecoin support if this was just some makeshift sting operation? Or build such complex free market infrastructure? Wouldn't a simple makeshift one be enough for a sting operation? They seem to me to be legitimate at all angles. Not that I buy illegal things.

While there has been ballot-box stuffing, and that should be accounted for, that would be a moot reason to avoid commenting on it. Keep in mind the votes are from people who actually have a Dropbox account, so the votes at least have some weight to them.
I'm saying that they "should", as in that would likely be in everyone's best interest for them to be open with their reasoning, as they have already been with other requests. The use of "should" as in people should not drive on icy roads. There's no entitlement involved in this use of "should". 
I sometimes use Dropbox, but admittedly I'm not going to pay for it, but at the same time I would like to see them accept bitcoin. If I was to want to pay for additional Dropbox hosting, I would through bitcoin if that was possible. Most of my interest in having Dropbox accept bitcoin as payment have to do with assisting in legitimizing the currency, and to set precedent as well.
I agree with you that right now bitcoin is by far not perfect, but at the same time I think that bitcoin has the ability to circumvent and find solutions to any of the down-sides that bitcoin currently has. The full potential of the idea behind bitcoin has by far not yet been met. I think that bitcoin will either adapt to it's full potential, or be replaced by something that does.
As for Dropbox being for the lay person, I don't think that's quite right. I think that Dropbox can be used by the lay person, but that it can just as easily be used by the tech savvy person. Adding another optional payment mechanism is hardly something that sacrifices simplicity of use to the lay person.
They may have their reasons, and perhaps lack of reasons for not commenting on accepting bitcoin at the moment. Perhaps they are waiting to see what becomes of it first. If the total votes reach say, a million, they might then implement it. As bitcoin grows, the chance of them accepting it also grows, and the sooner the better.
I think that bitcoin would be beneficial to Dropbox, at least in some small ways, and perhaps in bigger ways later on. Yet perhaps they do have higher priorities at the moment.

Bitcoin has worth because it is deflationary, has hard limits, receives attention, capable of transactions from anywhere that has internet access, largely unregulatable and unregulated, psudoanonymous, has novelty value, decentralized, and is the coming﻿ currency of the internet.
Bitcoin also has worth from the miners, if the miners couldn't afford to mine, then the currency would become even more deflationary,﻿ until they could start mining at a profit again.
Now why is anything that is considered money worth anything, and is any of it collectively better than bitcoin? If not, then bitcoin, or other crypto currencies are here to stay.

If two people deposit ten bitcoins each into your bank, and you then lend another person ten of those twenty bitcoins, you now have a 2:1 fractional reserve. If one of those two people comes back to withdraw their bitcoins, your bank now has a balance of zero. If both come back to withdraw, then your bank is bankrupt. The maximum allowed reserve ratio in the US is 10:1.
While there's not a Bank of Bicoinia yet, there are exchanges. So far they've been honorable, and have kept an even ratio. This won't always be the case, because an exchange would stand to gain the most from fractional reserve. Banks encourage people to store their money, to be used as fractional reserve, by offering interest (albeit a very small amount). These are called savings accounts or CD's. Banks are required to have insurance for in the event of bankruptcy. If they are in bad shape, they'll often get bought out by another bank, or given bailout loans. So there's virtually no risk in having your money in a bank, because it is insured by the government. If the government, by some off chance cannot cover for you, then you're out of luck. Chances are they'll just print more money to cover for anything. This is called Quantum Easing. Having your wealth in fiat currency is a form of tax, because the value is almost always going down by them printing more to spend. Any amount you would make from interest would be lost due to inflation (QE).

There are some obscure binary option platforms, that will give you something like $20-80 for free to bet with, but you have to win about 70% of the time to make anything. And they will only let you withdraw once you get to a certain amount. 
If you have a small amount of bitcoin, yet want to risk it with the bitcoin market while possibly making some money, then you can try Bitfinex. They let you leverage your money 2.5 to 1, and let you buy shorts.
I would take trading the market over betting on fixed outcomes any day. With trading you can mitigate your losses and maximize your gains, or hold on to and sell any time you want. (The latter being potentially dangerous in most cases, unless you know where the market is heading in the long run.)

Coinbase is as pretty trustworthy. They don't need your information, even if they had it, it wouldn't do them much good, instead they know who your bank is, and your bank presumably knows who you are.
Oh also, wire transfers cannot be reversed. This is good for bitcoin exchanges, as they can avoid the risk of chargeback fraud. (Also good for you, because without the risk, they can then charge cheaper fees.)
(I'm amazed that they send you free money, to confirm your bank account.)

Even if it is a self fulfilling prophecy, that's what most chart analysis is. It works mostly because other people use it too.
A market could consolidate for a very long time with very low volume if there was no demand or supply, but there's no reason to think that it would do the same if demand or supply was there, it took off because this market is bias upward. Admittedly, it could have fell if there was bad news at that time of consolidation.

There's a lot of faulty logic that goes into buying a new technology. Think of this way. Would you rather read the news from a few years ago, or the news from today? Neither is more likely to have a significant event that will directly affect your life any more than the other will. What it boils down to, is we just want the newest thing, even if there's something just as good that's older. New isn't always better or more important, as we like to think it is, at least not always right away. Today is not likely more important than any other day. This has nothing to do with hoarding.

There's one very secure one, but that takes about 1% of it. I don't think it's an issue, but it might be a potential issue for your friend. This is why bitcoin is considered pseudonymous.

It's a good idea to use the fibonacci with other trend analysis, and not just by itself. This is true with most indicators. If you want to know where the best point to sell or buy is, use the fibonacci.

I think that reform is important. Until bitcoin is fully developed, it should be allowed to be develop further. 
ASIC miners are perhaps too specialized, too industrial. Anyone can use a CPU, and that makes it viable as a means of protecting the chain. Most are willing to use the CPU on their computer to mine, most are not willing to buy an ASIC miner.
All it takes is one batch of super ASIC miners to take over the network. We have seen this nearly happen recently. Either the power of these specialized miners will stabilize, or they won't. CPU mining is the safer bet here.

Instability and volatility are bad for a currency, and very dangerous to new investors. For any profit you take from a bubble, there are those that are taking a loss. Bubbles create media attention, most of it good during the hyper mania, most of it bad after the crash. So bubbles do have their benefits, but they are also detrimental. Fortunately once the market reaches full saturation, and the hoarding rate becomes lower, the currency will have much more stable growth.

The trader must at all times have enough money in their account to pay back the loans.
Bitfinex will automatically close the position of trader if they are unable to cover for a change in price, and usually pay off all of their loans with almost everything in the traders account, unless there is a flash crash, then the trader might not be able to completely cover for the loans. There are some insured loans that can be offered.

Hoarding is bad because it leads to a speculative market, and speculation leads to hyper mania, which leads hoarders to panic sell in the event of a crash. In other words, it is the root cause of bubbles.
(Of course, there are those who will down vote this, because they do not understand how speculative markets work.)
Hoarders are speculators who only sell when everything comes crashing. That can be devastating.
While bitcoin may not be incredibly difficult to obtain, it can be costly, or take a long time. Hopefully this will change.

To note however, people will start hoarding more when the market starts to become like a bubble, and hoard less during a crash. The more people there are that don't care about the market fluctuations, the more stable it will be in this respect.

I still think it's a good idea for people to at least know about millibits. Or else they might feel like they missed the train, because the price is so high that they can't afford an entire coin. The sooner we adopt a smaller denomination, the easier the transition will be.
I'm sure a better name will replace the millibit in the future, in the same way that we have many names for dollars and cents. Or shorten words like 'cellphone' into simply 'cell'. We might just call them 'bits' for example.
One worry I have is that a millibit will become too large, in the same way a single bitcoin has. A single millibit is only worth about 13 cents right now, but once bitcoin doubles a few more times, it will be valued at well over a dollar, and it will only grow from there.

If the price rose steadily without crashing, then people would be more eager rather than skeptical to buy it, and that would in-turn cause a bubble. That's how they often start. This is also why having a market that is deflationary will cause many such market collapses, because more and more people will want to get in for the ride to the point where it goes parabolic. I realize that you can't ask for a totally stable deflationary market. But there will be things to lesson the blow of the hyper mania and deflation in the future.
