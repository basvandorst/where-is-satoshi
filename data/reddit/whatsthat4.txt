Video games and online gambling. People will want to buy the next upgrade in a big multiplayer game and use bitcoin. Huge customer base and good business case.

I believe crypto will be the currency to settle international transactions and online sales, as globalism continues to grow. So my business can buy from businesses in China or anywhere easier.
Central banks will remain. I personally dont like the Fed, but let's get real, their results (at a macro level) have been fantastic.  The world economy is booming.  I dont think most central banks are anywhere near collapse...and never will be.
I see crypto as just one more currency that would be good for settling those hard to settle transactions

Second this question. I get why there is a Gold ETF (so you dont have to actually get the gold shipped to you and it is more liquid), but If the ETF only has Bitcoin in it, then what's the point? It seems like an ETF is good  for commodities or a basket of securities, but bitcoin doesnt have the same problem about expensive physical delivery or liquidity
