Cash out a little bit at a time and maybe you can avoid questions. You surely don’t need the whole 100 BTC now?

I think it has to do with the following.
1) getting verified quickly on western exchanges
2) converting Korean currency to USD/EUR/etc. And the fees involved
3) the exchanges own fees for depositing/converting
Though sometimes the gap is HUGE and it would make sense to do as you say, so maybe there’s more reasons? Would love to be informed.

How about you just receive all of the salary and buy it yourself?

Bit late with this one mate

That’s sure what it feels like

Never have actually. I’ve looked in stellar lumens but I don’t want to have too many fingers in too many pies. Can you TL;DR the idea of TRON? What makes it good?

Sell and switch to other smaller cryptos mate. Look at ripple, low risk high reward

I’m in the UK... I’m not laying across country tariff just to solve a problem that they should solve over support tickets? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:39:23
They’re a business - problem isn’t with the coin it’s with the company...
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:32:11
Their twitter team seems to answer 2 people per week. I’ve had 1 ticket to their support team going on for over a month too. Ridiculous. They need to hire more customer service representatives. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:33:08
I see thanks mate. Since GDAX has no fees I just bought my coins straight back and probably gained like a fraction of satoshis haha
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:13:02
I understand that but they shouldn’t offer twitter and emails as a form of support if they only answer calls. Do you get what I mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:20:24
I use binance all the time to trade Ripple/XMR. I kinda gave up with bitcoin because atm to me it seems like a high risk medium reward compared to something like ripple.

The true value is whatever the market decides it is.

Is it a freephone?

Investing in website/app security is not FUD. It is just reinforcing safety. A perfectly reasonable suggestion lol.

There’s always the chance the companies lie of course but I don’t see why they’d file for bankruptcy. Surely it’s illegal to fraudulently do so? Though not as though legality has ever really stopped people from doing things.

I’ve used this feature on other websites and stocks before. I checked on the FAQ to make sure but it just confused me even more haha. Thanks anyway buddy, happy trading 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:12:33
Youbit happened very recently. Was their second time being hacked too. Now they’re filing for bankruptcy.

As much as I agree, I dislike how so many people have come to expect shitty service from coinbase yet there’s nobody/nothing attempting to hold them accountable for their actions and they continue to sit firmly as the  exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:11:06
Buy Ripple instead!
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:34:26
I’ve had two issues. One has gone on for over 1 week (that’s what this post is for because it’s a more concerning issue). And another issue I’ve had has not received any reply from support team ticket for over a month. I think I’ll join you and be done with this site.

DogeCoin $100 by 2018
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:10:43
What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:24:07
Oh right, so when I click stop then advanced I put the fee I want to cash out at in limit order? The website FAQ was kind of deceiving 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:25:00
Context: I’ve wrote 3 tickets and dm’d their support daily for a problem I’ve had about funds trapped in the account. 
Edit: since this post it seems their twitter team has actually finally woken up - perhaps coming back from the holidays.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:14:30
Actually cackled at this one, have an upboat
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:11:51
I have - above the tens of ‘Hello’s
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:15:06
You can do it this way mate:
Buy litecoin -&gt; send to binance -&gt; sell your binance for ethereum on there -&gt; buy XRP with ethereum!
Don’t buy ethereum on coinbase though, I’ve had a transaction waiting for 3 days 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:16:13
Is it free to call over Skype? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:22:16
Had also a ticket live for over 2 weeks. And a separate ticket for another matter for over a month. I wouldn’t have made this post if it was only this weekend I didn’t get a reply :)

I usually use Coinbase but there are a number of places you can use. Happy trading mate and welcome to ripple :P
