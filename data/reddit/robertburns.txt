push certain organizations to adopt bitcoin where I have some debt accrued, and use it to pay it all off

...and as a P2Pool node operator [mineandhodl.com:9332]( can confirm the donations came through! just check my address on the mining stats page

I'll admit, when I first started I choose the largest pool because I didn't know better.
But I've recently switched from GHash.IO to running my own P2Pool node.
consensus = awesome
Doing what I can to support Bitcoin and mining decentralization.

**Server / Pool Info:**
* The VPS is running 2 Cores with 2GB of Ram and SSD's.
* Running as a full Bitcoind and P2Pool node.
* When everything is online the system runs within 70% of capacity.
* 0% fee, 0.5% donation to author
**Mining Info:**
* The 1TH/s local rate comes from six Antminer S1's
* Power Supplies consist of four Corsair RM550's and a 1000W unit from Gigampz (excellent product, had he come out sooner would have bought more for all my miners)
* Three miners and a 6,000 BTU air conditioner per house circuit (15amp) in an old city 1921 city town home, heat and power usage seem just fine. (0.114 cents per KWH)
* even have my home computer in one of the rooms with the three miners and AC
*estimated time to profitability given change in difficulty and power / server costs, ~four months*
This setup experiences high VARIANCE, but PROFITABILITY is the same as GHash, Eligius and BTC Guild over a 30day period... I've mined on all three, so I should know.

appreciate your work! upvote @_date: 2014-05-26 03:00:14
agreed, I wish there were people pointing me in that direction when I got started, took me too long to figure all this s*it out.
the least we can do is make sure others know where to go when they ask and make sure people understand the important concepts behind pools and why they need to be de-centralized.
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:36:50
yes, for now, the rate varies wildly throughout the day though, would love to see it top 1PHs/s and stay there :-)
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:47:35
just to clarify you have bitcoind and p2pool running on the same box?
do you have the ports 8332, 8333, 9332 and 9333 open?
are you waiting until bitcoind is FULLY sync'd with the blockchain before starting up P2Pool?
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:53:57
you can check any of the P2Pool nodes info page for that, for example [mineandhodl.com:9332]( and look for **global pool rate**
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:23:16
**tip** you can view a list of all public P2Pool nodes at [
I also run an east coast P2Pool node here [mineandhodl.com:9332](
NO fee, and 0.25% of profits are donated back to the author of the P2Pool software.
if anyone has any questions about P2Pool, Bitcoin, or running / hardening their servers please message me, I love to teach.
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:33:14
this is superb! thank you for all your hard work
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:02:14
how long did you run your sample for comparison?
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:58:07
trying pointing your miner directly at bitcoind, not p2pool, see if it is able to connect and mine successfully
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:56:21
excellent, post your node IP when you have it up and running!
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:04:31
weird, glad you have it working now though, happy mining!
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:43:23
I'm on digital ocean as well, running a similar setup, after some time I upped my droplet to 2gb, it now runs at around 75% capacity
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:18:40
with P2Pool you have two options
 * run your own P2Pool node and mine on that
 * mine on someone else's P2Pool node, you can find a list of P2Pool nodes at [p2pool-nodes.info](
Option 1 can get rather technical as it requires running a [full bitcoin node]( alongside [your P2Pool node](
Option 2 is as simple as pointing your miners to a P2Pool node *address:port* and using your *bitcoin wallet address* as the username (you can use anything as the password, as it is not required).
After that it works the same as any other pool out there, except that the payout timeframe will vary (due to the low hash-rate of P2Pool at the time of this writing), but how much you'll make over 2-4 weeks will end up being the ~same.

right now the node is running from my office network.
working on securing it a bit more and opening it up behind a more public IP, have some friends and a few others that want to use it.
taking things slowly as I learn what I need to about administering this sort of thing.
