didn't expresscoin try this?

check out libertyx.com (1% fee @ stores) or bitquick.com (4% @ banks) - much better rates.

I've always liked LibertyX
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:19:31
was like that in the beginning for me. a lot better lately - seems like they are getting rid of the bad stores. their latest iphone app solves a lot of the problems. custom instructions based on the store. most of the stores in my area have been "trailblazed" meaning someone has made a purchase there. otherwise they pay you $5 extra BTC if you are the first to try a store. i've made a fair amt from trailblazers :)

why would they? it is hard to compete against people using free electricity and cheap money...
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:01:24
going to try! looks awesome.
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:20:22
its only a loss if you sell!

poor man's powerball :)

One obvious issue is that the memory is still flash based, which is pretty volatile and can easily degrade over time.  My gut says that the risk of losing your coins to hardware failure is greater than the risk of somebody hacking even very weak encryption.
Can anybody explain why this concern is not correct?
In the meantime, I burn an encrypted copy of my wallet to a DVD, which I then put in a safe for cold storage.

can you provide a breakdown of your ATMs profitability? you probably have unique insight into this.

College campus make sense but you prob need to charge students a lot to breakeven. You can make it work for sure, its just dollars &amp; sense.
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:43:55
100% premium?

bought some by my house recently from libertyx at atm

What else does your store sell? Do you accept bitcoin for payment?
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:38:48
I'm a big LibertyX fan. Only wish I could buy more (I don't think you can buy more than $1,000/day but you can't beat their prices. If you have an Ace Cash Express store near you try that - I just handed a stack of bills to the cashier, told them it was for LibertyX payment, entered my bitcoin address on my phone and I was good to go.
I'm a big fan of bitcoin ATMs. Their prices just have to come down. Why would someone pay 8% fees? Never made sense to me.

What are the sponsors contributing? $?

Just took a look at an old receipt I had lying around. It was 12 digits.
PS. I had this happen to me before. You should be able to get the store to reprint the receipt. Or email customer support.
@_date: 2015-04-21 01:44:10
me too
Edit: they meant coinbase, not libertyX
@_date: 2015-04-21 01:46:19
libertyX.com way cheaper / safer
@_date: 2015-04-25 12:19:46
and then they fight you...by using absurd fear tactics to encourage anti-competitive regulations
@_date: 2015-04-23 03:56:06
libertyx user not affected
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:41:24
where are you located?
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:25:53
love the visibility of these things for main-streamers
started using [libertyx]( myself recently...great for small instant buys
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:41:43
no one wants change...literally can't give it away
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:40:42
