Who to vote for depends on how you want the U.S. to be in twenty years.
Latinos make up 30!! of the population here, and most of them are under 15.  Most whites, who make up 65%, are older, and our birth rate is low.
This means that in twenty years whites will not only be a minority in the U.S., but a surprisingly small minority.  It is not clear how whites will be treated by other races when they get to vote for a new set of laws.
If this matters to you, you should vote for Trump, because he is the only man who has stated clearly that he will deal with this problem.
These demographics will affect bitcoin thus: In twenty years the people on this forum will be quite wealthy and will have the option to flee to safer places.  And all the wars and killing will probably cause bitcoin to rise in value as a safe haven asset.

One of the major activities of the U.S. government is psychological operations.  The financial markets are a huge tool in their arsenal to cause the bitcoin community to have self-doubt.  You can bet that they understand the potential of the bitcoin to undermine their powerbase, so they would need a large stash to engage in psychological ops using the TINY markets of bitcoin to hammer the bitcoin price.

At one point, Lawsky stopped to remind the panel that it’s not a matter of ‘if” they will be regulated, it’s a matter of how much.
“It’s not worth it for society to allow money laundering .. to persist to permit a thousand flowers to bloom on the innovation side,” Lawsky told the panel, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame.
Given a choice between stopping money laundering and allowing for innovation, “We’re always going to choose squelching money laundering,” he said.

All I needed to see from Ben Lawsky was during the bitcoin hearings back in January when he distinguished himself as "a regulator", a man who truly enjoyed being the center of attention and being a man in power.
But perhaps because I have made it a hobby to understand the politics of power in our time and what horrific crimes the government and its crony capitalists are capable of, I see Lawsky not as just another dude--someone I could have a beer with perhaps--but rather as a man who is attracted to power, someone who craves the ability to control others.  
As a though exercise I try to imagine him starting up his own business and sitting on the other side of the table trying to defend his young business from the control-freak regulators and you know what?  It's pretty hard to picture.  I don't think he has what it takes to brave the risks to start his own business because it wouldn't give him what he craves: the attention and power he revels in as "a regulator".  
It is my predilection to try to understand a person and I can't help but picture Lawsky as a little boy, belittled by his parents, probably has an older brother who terrorized him, and so little Lawsky sought out the best revenge.  He went straight for positions of power where he could finally get the chance to control others in a way that he never could as a child.  But he's smart and aggressive enough to elbow his way above the cops and building inspectors to become the head of a controlling bureaucracy, to become "a regulator".
And the rest of us are forced to live under the thumb of petty tyrants like him.  
Here is the "question" he posed to the bitcoin panelists that told me all I need to know about him.  I wrote it as he said it, but you REALLY need to listen to the man himself to smell the odor (
"If the choice ultimately is between preventing money laundering on the one hand--and I probably shouldn't use the word "money laundering" because it's too nice a word, frankly.  Money laundering is the facilitation of all kinds of horrific crimes that I think everyone in this room never wants to see happen, narcotrafficking being one, but acts of terrorism, funding rogue nations, etc., all take place through massive money laundering, now we have it in our system as we do now--but to have money laundering--the choice for the regulator is permit money laundering on the one hand, or permit innovation on the other, we're always going to choose squelching money laundering first.  It's not worth it to society to allow money laundering and all of the things it facilitates to persist in order to permit a thousand flowers to bloom on the innovation side.  I think the question is whether we can get somewhere in between where we're very comfortable--VERY comfortable--that we're preventing the money laundering but still allowing innovation.  But I guess I would open it up to the panelists--I could start down here--would you agree that ultimately if the choice is and maybe this is an unfair question, but ultimately the choice is between getting rid of money laundering but squelching innovation that we all agree the FIRST job is to get rid of the money laundering, all that it facilitates?"

There's NOT a great deal of privacy already.  To buy in quantity one must send funds to an exchange (US 3-letter agencies take notice of this).  Then, one may use TOR to engage in bitcoin transactions, but this is a pain in the ass for most people, and one slip-up and one's transactions can be traced backwards and forwards.  The situation is desperate actually.
Privacy should be built in at the core.  If bitcoin doesn't do this then another coin will and there will be a FLOOD of people surging to OUTLAW COIN.

Okay, this author is missing the point entirely.  The reason bitcoin is not going to be big in the United States is because of oppressive regulation.  He says this:
"The reality is that in North America, consumers have access to a fairly decent set of financial services," Peter Smith, COO of Bitcoin wallet firm Blockchain, told BI in an email. "This isn't the case in the majority of the world. In fact, a huge portion of the world has little to no access to anything that would give them an even base level of financial capabilities."
So, it's access to "a decent set of financial services" that explains why the U.S. is down the list?  As if Switzerland and Canada don't have decent financial services!?
No way.  The U.S. has set up a police state complete with capital controls and oppressive regulations and that is why it is a waning empire (and a bitcoin laggard).

You need to write a letter to the credit union that handed out your money.  You need to explain what happened and demand to be paid back.  You need to give them 30 days to respond.  You will say if they do not respond within 30 days that this will be deemed as being in agreement with your claim.  You need to send this letter certified return receipt to prove when they received it.  (Be sure to put the certified number on the letter itself so that they can't claim you sent them an empty envelope or something so you have to get some slips from the post office before you write the letter.)

* Wall St is starting to put money into bitcoin
* bitcoin is the largest computer network on earth

Bitcoin is going into the thousands.  Has to.  Look at these industries: remittances, black market, int'l money transfer, wall street.

Dear Gov,
Please call Ben Lawsky off of Bitcoin.  His regulations are not so much about protecting anyone from Bitcoin, but more about trying to kill it.
But you can't kill Bitcoin because it is an idea whose time has come, plus it's decentralized so don't waste your time.
If you don't call off Lawsky you will be allowing him to hurt the economy of New York as the Bitcoin community puts a digital wall around it.  That will pretty much make your legacy a joke to history.
So again, please call Lawsky off Bitcoin.  Instead, think of how you can make New York the BEST place to set up a Bitcoin business.  Thanks...and fuck you.

Bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars later this year.  There are several industries--any one of which--will put it there.  First we have Wall St and that's Big Boy Money.  Next, is remittances.  Last, is System D, the black market.
If bitcoin were to capture just a tiny fraction of these markets its price would go into the thousands.  This is just simple math.
Do not forget how early in the game we are, people.  Most people STILL HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD of bitcoin.  So quit selling; you're just giving your shares to the strong hands who come here and spread negative thoughts.

I've said before on other threads that Brewster is obviously a psychopath, someone who seamlessly manipulates others to swindle them.
It is critically important that we all learn how to spot psychopaths, otherwise these unfortunate crimes will keep happening.  Actually, Brewster is small potatoes compared to big-time political psychopaths like Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Newt Gingrich, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle, Dick Cheney, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Wolfowitz, and that's just a modern sampling!  History is full of these monsters.
Psychopaths gravitate to power hierarchies where they excel because they manipulate or bowl over the non-psychopaths.  (This is why you find so many of them in the military, politics, and corporations.)
They also often crave attention so many psychopaths become actors and entertainers.
They will tell stories to gain sympathy from an audience, like when Brewster tells us that he was just trying to protect his daughter.  They will try to swing the crowd against their accusers, like when Brewster implies the police are setting him up or that the threats may have been coming from the other managers.

I can't believe the incredible skepticism heaped upon anyone who points out the ridiculous potential of bitcoin.  And it is a RIDICULOUS potential!  You could point out so many reasons why this new invention is going to turn the financial landscape upside down and yet, the average person HAS NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT.
I think the reason why there are such skeptics here to the great news in store for bitcoin lies in the psychology of the denizens of this reddit: they are software engineers, and software engineers, like nearly all engineers, are supremely confident in what they know.  Even when it is not justified.
I call it the "know it all" syndrome.  Not sure if it's chicken or egg.  That is, do know-it-alls become engineers or does engineering make them know-it-alls?  I don't know.  But hey, did you catch that?  I said "I don't know" and that is one little phrase you will RARELY hear from an engineer, especially a software engineer, and especially "the A team".  (That term, The A Team, was what Microsoft called their engineers, because they were so much better than the rest, or so they told themselves.)
But the culture at Microsoft demonstrates what I am saying perfectly, that the software engineer culture is based on machismo and confidence and the ability to project that confidence to everyone around you.  But it also means that the know it all can't very often say "I don't know", because then how bad-assed would he appear?
So, please please you bad ass know it alls out there, please develop a little humility and just try a little experiment.  This is called personal growth.  Just make your lips say one simple little phrase, like this: "I don't know".  Just try it.
For a remarkably refreshing description about software engineers (by a software engineer, and a bad ass at that), read "About Face" by Alan Cooper.
Now that I've said all that, I think bitcoin is the most valuable substance on earth, so of course, I agree with OP.

Once you know about the psychological affliction known as "psychopathy" this kind of thing makes perfect sense.  Psychopaths lack empathy.  They are unaffected by the typical feelings of guilt and remorse that the rest of us commonly experience.
This allows them to find excitement and glee when they are able to profit from tricking others.
The president of Butterfly Labs, Chris Vleisides, is a convicted felon.  He orchestrated a massive mail order scam that ran from 1990 to 2006 and tricked people out of $19 million.  Psychopaths are typically very bored until they are able to WIN against other people, and since they don't feel guilt WINNING takes the form of CHEATING others out of their money.
Don't think that these guys are unusual.  Psychopaths are at the top of every important company and organization.  We live in a society where psychopaths have huge advantages, and this should not surprise: our society was created by psychopaths.
Our only hope is to replace the huge, centralized hierarchies with small, local organizations.  In this way, if a psychopath is recognized we can do like the Inuit, and push them off the ice!  (

Unless and until bitcoin or another altcoin becomes completely anonymous, there will be no protection from the surveillance state.  Be certain that the alphabet agencies have the best blockchain analysis tools.
The IRS will be sending out a new type of letter demanding that their victim justify any discrepancy between their tax return and data on the blockchain.  As usual, guilt will be assumed and it is the victim's job to prove them wrong.
Of course, the victim can refuse to pay or even cooperate, which will result in liens being placed on all known property, and even jail time.  Same as it works now.

These distinctions seem silly.  Once an address is tied to a person then their transactions can be traced forwards and back.

I think Stefan is brilliant at explaining things.  Some of his views on family seem strange to me.  He seems to think that if parents didn't spank their kids then society would be transformed.  As a parent of two teenagers his theory seems silly to me; the methods used by a parent to gain compliance by the children have an indirect effect on the shape of society.  (I notice some of these libertarian parents consider themselves parenting experts as they raise up their cute little DAUGHTERS.)  A little humility would be nice, Stefan.

One of the biggest reasons why they want to do this is to prevent bank runs.  Citizens mobbing the banks to get their cash out scares them so they want to eliminate that door of escape when their policies become intolerable.

—- FULL STATEMENT from Temple Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department —-
Suspicious Person Call in Temple City on Feb. 20, 2014
At 2:09PM, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2014, Temple Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department received a suspicious person call in Temple City. The caller reported an unknown woman in her 20’s was knocking on the door at his home, and sitting on his porch for the past hour. The caller said he was afraid to open the door.
Two deputies responded and spoke to the male resident caller and the woman. The woman identified herself as Newsweek reporter Leah Goodman and the resident expressed reluctance to talk to her. The deputies were present for the brief conversation between the two, and then the resident went back inside his home and the reporter left.
“I spoke to the two Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies who handled the call and who were present for the conversation,” said Captain Mike Parker, Sheriff’s Headquarters Bureau, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. “Both sheriff’s deputies agreed that the quotes published in the March 6, 2014, Newsweek magazine Bitcoin article that were attributed to the resident and to one of the deputies were accurate.”

To do this they use enormous databases of numbers, letters, special characters, words, and phrases, song lyrics, shakespeare plays, etc. in addition to greater and greater computing power.
And EVERY bitcoin is vulnerable to this to some extent, right, even if one does the off-line paper wallet thing?

Months back I attempted to create a paper wallet by following some bullet list that a helpful person put together.

But then I tried again on my other laptop that I used all the time.  I safely got past the point of previous failure, but then the loading software asked me a question that I thought I understood, something like "which drive do you want to use for swap, A, B, C?"  I thought I understood what was going to happen when I said go ahead and use "A".  Fuck.  Bricked again.

But then I realized that this is a fantastic sign of the times, because it means that--even though bitcoin has already achieved momentous things, like being the largest computing project on earth--the average person has not even heard (or listened) about it.  That means to me that the price of bitcoin is going to go through the roof when the average person finally takes a moment to look, listen, and comprehend bitcoin and realize they should own some of it.
I think I'll be able to look back on these times when I couldn't find anyone to sell me a car for bitcoin and laugh at the absurdity of it.

But how does the nature of the blockchain change once this gets started?  It's still a ledger of all transactions, but the connection to real-world identities (which are established through evidence outside the blockchain) is broken?

Well, it's a good question.  But psychopaths DEFINITELY can be among us without detection.  We've been conditioned by the media to think that psychopaths are violent criminals.  Books have been written about the large number of psychopaths among corporate executives.  There is some discussion about the difference between psychopaths, sociopaths, and people with anti-social personality disorder and I haven't unraveled that.
But george bush, bill clinton, tony blair, all are classic psychopaths.  Until we learn to spot them, psychopaths will do everything they can to step in front of our social movements and lead us.

I'll sell you some bitcoin, provided we are both protected.  If you want let me know and we can both look into an escrow service.
And let me give another point of view on the advice to only deal with localbitcoin sellers who have extensive transaction history: I have been trying to sell bitcoin locally (Austin area) with absolutely no success even though my price is the best to be found.  Selling these things appears to be difficult here.
Bitcoin is very young and the majority of sellers in my market have zero history; that doesn't make us crooks.  Everyone starts at zero.

Bitcoin won't solve humanity's problems, but it definitely gets the ball rolling.  People also need to DO permaculture; it's simply the only way forward.
But we must also realize that people who WANT to be the leaders are different than the rest of us.  They crave power and lack the ability to feel empathy for others.  They are known as 'psychopaths' in the mental health community and unless people study this affliction they will continue to allow the psychopaths to take over.

So silvertiger, are you saying that the patchwork of 47 state licenses is due to federal law requiring states to administer money transmission licenses?  And that such federal laws should go away?
Or are you wanting the senator to increase federal power by taking the power to administer licenses away from the states and keeping it at the federal level?
If the second is what you want I could not disagree with you more.  We simply need to get rid of know your customer and anti-money laundering laws, hello?

I see no reason why any municipality can not declare its support for alternative currencies and set up the means to do so.  At this point such a local government might seem quite avant garde, but the future will make it look quite prescient.

Well believe it.  Thanks for your offer of help but I signed up at ubuntu forums who told me--after the second bricking--that my data was likely gone.  
The ubuntu install process can be extremely dangerous for newbs.  Dangerous defaults are offered with little explanation and questions are asked that a newb couldn't really know.
I bought a new computer hoping to create a dual-boot, but my laptop has 4 primary partitions so I have to get rid of one of them before I can FINALLY load ubuntu (sigh).
I maintain that the difficulty of all this security is going to really hurt bitcoin adoption.  We are there right now; I have friends who want to own bitcoin, but I can't recommend they take the plunge because I don't think they're going to be able to handle all this other stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:32:30
People with a lot of bitcoin want to spend it, but they can't at the moment.  They are in the position of trying to convince businesses to accept it.  This will change however.

Well congratulations!  Gosh, things are happening so fast.  Services like this are needed.  I, for example, want to buy rural supplies and equipment, like well pipe, animal feed, electric drills and so on.  Tractor Supply is a good example of the stuff I need, but there's nothing quite like that now.
I also need to buy a tractor, a used car, and big water tanks...just country stuff!  The fact that I can't is both annoying and amazing because it points out how big this thing will become when I can!

Hmm, I went to blockchain.info to see if I could understand what I am seeing there and I saw a running list of transactions, inside of which are addresses. If the ledger is a list of transactions which contain addresses that are "owned" inside people's wallet.dat files, where do brainwallets fit in that scheme?

Mt Gox used to be almost twenty pts higher than bitstamp, but lately bitstamp is sometimes higher.  The difference used to be explained by "it's hard to get dollars out of Mt Gox" or some such.

Wow, this is a revelation!  So, the blockchain shows bitcoin going into an exchange and leaving the exchange, but not buying and selling inside an exchange...So many questions...

One of the ways that the Chinese can get their money out of the country is bitcoin.  Bitcoin has powered upward in the past month largely due to this phenomenon, IMO.
Something to watch, therefore, is a response by the Chinese government to put a halt to this capital flight, because that could make the bitcoin price fall.

And then there's THIS: The process could even be reduced to an anonymizing “toggle switch” that would enable users to launder their coins on command, says Taaki. “You buy the bitcoins in a normal exchange, switch this on, and it slowly anonymizes them for you in the background,” he says.
Why in the hell did the IP address ever need to be announced in the first place?  That's not very nice.
I think it's obvious that bitcoin is broken in the privacy respect and that something must be done.  Is this something a person can OPT INTO that will not result in a fork in the blockchain, where the statists go in one direction and the anarchists in the other?  I strongly suspect that humanity, if given the choice, will opt for privacy!

I'll be watching the answer you get.  Unfortunately, most advice I've seen starts with "install ubuntu".  I've bricked two computers trying to do this.  It's a minefield for most people.
Keeping bitcoin secure is absolutely the achilles heel of bitcoin.

Let's say the trader wanted to remove his big bundle without revealing anything to someone doing a sophisticated blockchain analysis (you just KNOW that the most sophisticated blockchain analysis programs are being developed by the NSA/CIA/IRS!).
Any coin leaving the exchange exits from the trader's receiving address and therefore reveals the number of bitcoins won?

One place I am stuck is what IS a "brain wallet"? I thought it was just a way to help humans make hard-to-crack pass phrases.
But then I also realize I don't understand the public/private key encryption as it relates to a bitcoin transaction (which, to me, is that long weird number that starts with a '1').
Which transactions on the blockchain (ledger of all transactions) are protected by a brain wallet?  How does this stuff relate to the wallet.dat file?
Thanks for clarifying ANY of this.  I really would like to understand.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:33:57
I'm trying to understand this. From   we get a description of trustless mixing: "Rather than hand a user’s bitcoins off to a typical Bitcoin laundry service that must be trusted to send back another more anonymous bitcoin, trustless mixing bundles together a collection of Bitcoin transactions and simultaneously sends them to new Bitcoin addresses that are also controlled by the same users; Since no one watching the transactions can see whose coins went where, the technique erases any ownership-identifying traces on the coins, while also avoiding the problem of trusting a third-party service to sufficiently mix the coins and not to simply steal them."

Alright, cipher_gnome and baillou2, I finally get what you are saying.  Someone sits there and generates their own passphrases, hashes them, works out addresses for those passphrases and finds those addresses in the blockchain.  OK, got it now!

For the record, here is a tutorial on paper wallets from blockchain.info:
There are quite a few problems here that aren't covered very well by the authors, like how secure your system must be from keyloggers and spyware.
Also, I have a hard time understanding blockchain.info's user interface.  I can't grasp their mental model.
