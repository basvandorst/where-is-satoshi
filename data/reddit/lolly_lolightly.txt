What are you getting now? I know I've had big drop offs with increased difficulty. 
$375 gets how much hashing power? Judging by their pricing that's roughly ~12.5MH/s, which is about 5.16x less than my avg hashrate on my home rig. At .005-.0055, you're looking at $1.4-$1.5/day. If we take your max of 0.0055ETH(1.534USD) and multiply it by 5.16 we are at $7.92. At the time Genesis was paying you directly in ETH, Nicehash was paying me over $10/day in BTC for 5.16 your hashing power. If I were paying hydro(I'm not, it's included in my rent), the cost would be about $2CAD($1.55USD) per day. So first of all, they're paying less than pool mining would, even after power, Claymore's cut, Nicehash's cut. Secondly, your daily revenue puts your ROI at 250 days, if it doesn't change at all. Seeing as I've seen a decrease in profit(everything I mine is profit, as I owned everything prior to mining) from over $10/day to $6.50-8/day since you first posted. I can only believe that you're seeing a similarly scaling decrease in revenue.
Seriously, for ~$450USD(factoring in an OEM W7/W10 license, it's cheaper if you use linux), you literally could own a physical [computer]( that does 11-12.5MH/s. You'd likely be making more than with Genesis if you used something like Nicehash. An RX 560's power draw is almost negligible too. The ROI is a little later, but at least you _own_ something if ETH becomes unprofitable to mine.

At the time you wrote this, I was seeing over $10USD/day from nicehash using ~64MH/s(2x R9 Fury). Right now I'm between $6.50-8USD/day. I lost out on over $2USD/day in less than a two week period due to difficulty. This is with hardware I _already_ owned for gaming, so ROI was a non-issue. I think these defenders are willfully ignorant to the situation they got themselves into.
