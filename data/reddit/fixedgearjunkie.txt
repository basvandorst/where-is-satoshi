I never did care...I mean I always cared about Bitcoin and the  financial revolution that it slowly bringing about. But I never CARED about the cost of btc in USD. I only have a few hundred dollars worth of electricity invested in mining back in 2014. Then I unplugged the miner and didn't even look at btc for nearly 3 years. Fast forward to 2017 when my gal asked if I ever heard of btc and that it's x price in USD. I was like holy shit! Now I only buy 25-50 dollars of btc a month. So  no matter what markets do I still hold btc and have enough fiat to pay bills. So nope I don't care either. Never really did, never really will care what the markets do. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:53:54
That's a hell of a reminder and why i have no problem swapping spare cash for btc.

@_date: 2018-01-21 23:49:28
Same here. I'm definitely keeping an eye on price and accumulating when others are selling.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:11:26
Price of aquiring a single Bitcoin? Around 11.5k USD at this time. It varies wildly so is unimportant in the grand scheme of things. 
Price of total economic freedom? Priceless.
Price of ucensorable money? Priceless.
Price to know your savings will not be totally debased by inflation? Priceless.
Think about what your buying here. Not necessarily how much of the opposite you can trade it for at a later time. You're not buying a get rich quick scheme or investment vehicle. You're buying the freedom to transact with whoever you want wherever you want, for whatever reason you want. As long as you pay the miner fee no one can stop those transactions. Think about that for a minute.

@_date: 2017-12-05 02:26:15
I actually have been planning to do the same thing. I mined almost .3 BTC in 2014. Didn't make a million dollars so I kind of lost interest. Then my gf asked if I ever heard of it back in september. Checked the price, started thinking damn if I had just bought $35/week btc instead of cigs all this time, I'd probably be retired or at least have the house paid for. Logged into my coinbase account for the first time and low and behold there was 0.01001 BTC in it. Apparently back then they gave you $5 worth for signing up. Tomorrow will be day 1 of no smoking, wish me luck. I hope you stay motivated to remain a non-smoker and keep diverting those funds to btc.

Not that deeply invested...only what I can afford to lose. And it is in bitcoin, not some shady ass exchange or shitcoin. Bitcoin is fully transparent, download the source and check it for yourself. I don't need to trust any exchange or shitcoin developers as I am not interested in trading  for fiat or shitcoins. They have nothing to do with bitcoin and I am not investing in them. No hypocrisy from me. You're exactly right in your comparison of central banks to butfinex. Neither should be trusted in my opinion as neither can be independently audited by you or me. Bitcoin however can be audited by anyone.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:23:20
I cruise through on occasion and they seem to be of the opinion or cite some correlation to whenever there is a bunch of tether printed the bitcoin price rises. I don't know, I don't care about shitcoins or the price of bitcoin in fiat, so haven't looked into it much.

@_date: 2018-09-02 17:21:39
I been buying a little every week all year. So some of it was bought at peak. Some at 5.5k. I'm feeling pretty good. But I also acquired the bulk of my coin in 2014. This is a long term investment for me. HODLing until there is no need to convert back to fiat.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:16:58
The more actions governments take against bitcoin the more attractive it becomes to me personally. I take it as a sign bitcoin is doing exactly what it was intended to.

HODL until satoshi/dollar parity :)
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:45:11
They're really gonna be pissed they bought in December 2017 and sold in  June 2018 when 2022 rolls around. 
Or maybe not. Its anyone's guess.
@_date: 2018-09-21 00:17:22
Hell yeah! That's my plan. But before we reach Satoshi/dollar parity we won't be measuring value in dollars anyway.
@_date: 2018-09-21 00:15:07
Keep mining and hodl. Several years from now you will look at these times as the good ol days. I turned mine off when I was still mining .01 BTC/day doh!
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:29:34
We might. But if we are, we won't be measuring it in fiat anyway so it is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-08-05 23:54:39
Like you're going to get a security clearance once they know you're broke, probably have bad credit, and must be involved in darknet markets because of bitcoin.
But then again the government has a long history of hiring flunkies so whatever.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:11:29
At the time it was just something fun and interesting to do. That loss of $.50/day in electricity turned into $100/day in four years. Would I have been better off just being coins? Financially sure. But I probably would not have learned as much though.
Edit: now days I do just buy a little on a regular basis regardless of price in fiat.
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:43:36

It's a loss today. I Mined for a year at a "loss". Best thing I ever did. If you don't need to liquidate to fiat immediately it can be fun and even profitable if you can hold the Mined coins for a few years.

As if we live in some kind of pristine environment presently. Earth is already rapidly turning into a wasteland. Sure bitcoin mining operations are not helping. Most miners seek the cheapest power sources they can find. These tend to be hydro producers with excess power. Bitcoin will not kill the environment. The plastics surrounding you, the chemicals sprayed to produce food, and the cars you see on the road will.
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:43:04
Exciting either way I guess. 
On one hand any additional ways to get  in is probably good. Most of my friends/family would not trust a major investment to them managing a small blob of text or 24 words lol.
On the other hand it's hard to imagine Satoshi would be stoked on all the shenanigans that come along with the big financiers (artificial booms and busts).

@_date: 2018-08-07 23:45:58
This is bullshit. Well sort of lol. I hate the idea of parting with my precious coinage. However, when one wants to purchase something, increasingly you can find a merchant offering that something for a discount if you pay in bitcoin.
Take cannabis seeds (not legal everywhere I know) there are several vendors granting up to 25% discount for paying with Bitcoin. So buy the beans, coffee, whatever, ideally when Bitcoin to Fiat exchange rate is favorable. Just make sure to replenish quickly or on the next dip in Bitcoin to Fiat exchange rate.

The same people that cling to the environmental argument are generally the same people driving cars, buying more bullshit than they need, and living in houses larger than they need (or could afford without manipulated interest rates). It is quite ingenuine, and strips them of all credibility.

The Nobel prize winner is certainly not an idiot. But stating crypto is reversing 300 years of financial evolution (as if the current system evolved and was not created to benefit a subset of humanity) is certainly ingenuine to say the least. Say what you will, but taxation is theft. Inflation is a tax on those looking to save their hard earned money. Government having control of money is not inherently immoral. Having private institutions in control of money IS DEFINITELY immoral.

Energy gets used for all manner of things. That's what we produce it for...to be used. Who knows, mining may actually speed adoption of renewables.The energy used by miners is a non-issue in my mind currently. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:13:20
I mined in 2014, pennies at the time holded most of them. Been actually buying since 4k all the way up and all the way down. Will keep buying as I realize the err of my ways when i was not buying 2014-2017. Hoping to start spending 2024.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:47:05
And what of all the energy use for us to use reddit, facebook, google, etc. Those data centers are consuming much more power than bitcoin miners likely ever will. Isn't the majority of commercial mining operations powered by hydro anyway? The energy consumption argument against bitcoin is bogus.

They do, and I hope they improve. But there is a saying something like: where convenience begins, security ends. So I think anything that might be storing immense value may be inconvenient to use. Safes, vaults, etc are kind of a pain. But I'm sure they will mature right along with everything else.

RIiiiiiight...summer of 2015 I shut my old ASICs down. Didn't even think of buying any more Bitcoin because "muh bubble has popped, party is over, and pyramid schemers stole your money"
Glad I HODL'd...feel dumb as fuck for not just going all in. But who knew.
Now I just buy more and HODL with at least a 4 year horizon. Best part is you do not need to use credit just watch the price. Whenever there's a nice pull back jump on in with what you would otherwise bet on a boxing match. Oh shit it went down? Buy more and set the timer for 4 years. 
Will it go down between now and then? Almost guaranteed...will you be in the green in 4 years, eh maybe maybe not. But my money says hell yeah!
Four years ago a Bitcoin ETF would be a joke. And NOONE would have thought the owner of NYSE would jump in. Bitcoin is going legit. When it fully goes legit there will be the largest value transfer ever witnessed in human history. 
Get on board or get left ashore.
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:44:25
Like mortgages and loans have "value". Wasn't it only like 10 years since the mortgage-backed securities literally melted down? Oh how soon we forget. I'll keep hodling my bitcoin that has "no value to it". Although markets tell me the current value of 1 bitcoin in USD is just shy of $9k. Enjoy being on the wrong side of history.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:05:55

Have you been living under a rock mate? For years now these "useless" bitcoins have been LITERALLY used to transfer mass amounts of value around the globe more times than you wiped your ass in the same timespan.
Bitcoin serves many purposes.
- For some it stores value (been in it since 2014) and mad gainz bruh. That $20/month in electricity I paid for turned into $100/day.
-For others it is a rapid and third-party-free remittance protocol. I send MANY, no really MANY USD to my sister who lives abroad using FRACTIONS of the Bitcoins Mined 4 years ago on a near monthly basis. These transfers are almost free compared to alternative remittance options and a helluva lot faster.
-fiat currencies inflate, and inflate, until no one accepts them, they die, and they are replaced with better currency. This has been demonstrated many times. Go Google it or something...fuck me.
-Some of us actually spend this stuff, look around, mofos give discounts when you pay with real money.
-sell it to the greater fool? Get me 1.5 bitcoin, I sell you my federal reserve note EIGHT THOUSAND US dollars in exchange. Deal? If not then your greatet fool blah blah is proven bullshit. Hell better yet, someone set the remind me bot and let's make this deal in say 4 years time?

last time i bought on coinbase it was over market value plus their fee. Most bitcoin ATMs charge a fee and over spot price. Let me know if you find an exchange that doesn't do this. But I suspect they all do it to ensure or increase profitability.
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:07:47
Doesn't look like they have a choice. Short of making it illegal to own, mine, possess, or accept which looks less likely everyday.
The big boys don't want to be left behind in the new paradigm and are actually legitimizing bitcoin. (See ETFs and ICE products forthcoming)
Just HODLing until I can buy shit on amazon and pay the tax man with ~~bitcoin~~ satoshis.

Nobody has used GPUs to mine Bitcoin for years. They've been used for altcoins. Either way, what do you think drove Nvidia's RnD for the last few years? Blockchain did.
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:33:58
SHA256 is pretty much dominated by ASICs, big farms of ASICs. Doubt some gamers GPU mining would affect difficulty all that much.
GPU still good for other algos, just dump the alts for bitcoin. 
But these guys bitching is the definition of hypocritical. They think miners are bad for using these chips to do something. But its perfectly ok for them to do something else with them.

Was mining during the long bear market of 2014-2015. I remember unplugging my miners as it was summer and heat became an issue.

@_date: 2018-05-05 22:43:35

Maybe he was referring to the account verification that is required before they allow you to withdraw? Buying and xferring were very fast. Verification was actually pretty fast too (3 hours in my case).

And that one doesn't "invest" in Bitcoin. It's not supposed to be a profit generator. It's a protest, that sometimes goes up in value when compared to inferior money.

Who knows, who cares? Are blocks still being added every 10 minutes? Then bitcoin is doing EXACTLY what it was made to do.
I'm nowhere near being 70&amp; in the red. I was waaaaaay in the red during the last "death" of bitcoin in 2014. So much so I just kind of forgot about crypto for a couple years. This "death" too shall pass.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:27:23
Just HODL it. who knows by the time you graduate from college 5 mBTC may buy you a nice used car. Or you could sell it or find somewhere to spend it. In the grand scheme of things $33 is not a large sum, let it ride and forget about it for a few years.

Sent my sister Bitcoin yesterday p2p. Worked well enough for us. 100 USD xferred half a world away for 12cents. Not instantly, but faster than a bank. I'm glad people who only came for fiat profits are bailing. Now real coiner can get back to using and building bitcoin.

I can't believe people still bank with them. Can't blame them from stopping people gambling with their money though. Buying bitcoin/crypto w credit card is not smart anyway. I'm sure they had too many cardholders max out their cards buying in the run up to the ATH. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:09:27
Supply is NOT halving. Currently like 17million coins in supply. It is not dropping to 8.5million. jjjjesus

People who "lost everything" may have deserved it if they didn't understand what they were getting into yet  put everything in it. Harsh I know, but if you are that greedy and that foolish with your investing strategy you will get rekt. Something about eggs in one basket. I believe in Bitcoin. I have believed for 4 years. It's been good to me. But I'm not taking a second mortgage to buy the fuckin dip in hopes that it moons again and I can lambo

I guess they're thinking TCP/IP sits on top of other layers (physical / Data Link) and other layers sit on top of TCP/IP (Application) to form what people know as the Internet? LN is just the second layer of Bitcoin and likely there will be other layers as well which add more functionality.

Its definitely going down. But to think it will not survive is a little far-fetched don't you think? You've been around this longer than me (2014) and even I know if we dip to 2014 levels I better shuffle some funds around and pick up as much bitcoin as I can.

Bitcoin will not make everyone equally wealthy. That's mentioned nowhere in the whitepaper. Lazy people will always be lazy, bitcoin doesn't change that. There will always be kids born to people of above average means and intelligence. Bitcoin will not change that.
What it will change is the average person can now save a percentage of their earnings in order to purchase something later in life (house, car, leave something to kids, etc) without being robbed by inflation and wondering why they're not getting anywhere near their goals.

I don't know, I can't predict the future like you. But it sure seems like we have a little ways lower yet to go. Im still seeing too much positive news in the press and positive posts on social media. When I see an overwhelming amount of despair, anger, and finally a massive loss of interest, I'll feel  good that we've hit bottom. Until then I would tread carefully. 
I am still accumulating in very small amounts, saving a nice stack of usd for the bottom to hopefully scoop up as many cheap coins as possible.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:05:45

Yea man $30 at age 16....you'll never miss it in case bitcoin goes to 0 (which I highly doubt anyway). Most likely if you buy $30 now, when you graduate from HS, you'll be wishing you would have dumped a lot more than $30.

The FOMO was fun, but it really slowed down my accumulation. Hoping it goes much lower, tired of these high prices. Hard to pay six grand for something you bought a few years ago for a couple hundred.

Too early to say with certainty that never ending price recovery is an intrinsic property of bitcoin. So far it has always recovered. As for the past performance...future...blah blah. Most traditional investments are required to provide a similar disclaimer in their prospectus materials. No shit past doesn't predict future, that's why there's risk. No risk no reward though.

Sure it feels good. But it only feels that way because we have been conditioned to think dollars = value. I love seeing the price go crazy high, crazy fast. Except then I realize I don't have enough. Wait for a dip like this week buy more. If it "crashes" to 2k bummer. Buy more and wait for the enevitable elevator. 
If it goes to zero (hint: it probably won't) oh well. I'm out cigarette and beer money. Guess what? Cigarettes and beer converted to Bitcoin haven't let me down in the last 4 years.
Some days I start to believe it is all in fact a Ponzi. But then again blocks keep getting mined and immutable transactions keep happening every 10 minutes right on schedule. 
Spend high, replenish when you see headlines about Bitcoin's death.

I've often contemplated this one myself. Like maybe bitcoin is planned to be the precursor to a one world currency. They created bitcoin, will pump it and everyone is using it, then kill it. 
The people would be so outraged, they would beg for a one world government which issues its own fiat crypto.
But then I put the weed down and realize if there was some sort of backdoor someone would have already found/exploited it long before now.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:42:48
Ouch on the 18k entry. Hopefully DCA brings that down for ya and you'll be sitting very pretty in a few years. Or its all gone. But I just bought a small amount yesterday so I'm betting on it recovering in long term.

Why not sell 75&amp; of holdings (6x or 7x profit as you state below) and leave 25&amp; to see if it goes way higher later? If it continues to fall pull your remaining 25&amp; out before incurring losses. I agree it definitely is different this time, the future has never been brighter for bitcoin.

 I mined at a "loss" for a year during one of the previous deaths of bitcoin in 2014. Only wish I would have continued losing into 2016. I could have easily afforded it, just kind of lost faith. So I shut the miners off and totally forgot about my coins until late 2017.

Pretty much. Still more fun getting in at the lows. The tech is coming along nicely. Still have a lot of progress to be made. Can't speak for anyone else, but I'm hoping to hold the bulk of mine until it's mainstream. Spending some when price is high is fun too. I try to replace it when the price "crashes" though or even better, increase my holdings.

Would you take out a 100k loan to buy lottery tickets?
How about a 100k loan to "invest" in the traditional stock markets? 
Theyre both gambles and while I am bullish on Bitcoin taking the same 100k loan and buying Bitcoin hoping to make more Fiat is also gambling. 
Buy Bitcoin when you have extra money and don't need to leverage credit. Save your credit for buying a house, car, or even going on a dope ass vacation. 
I live gambling, but I only do so with money that is my own and never borrowed.
Best of luck whatever you do.

The fact there are still people thinking we will see 100k in a year and a half tells me we are nowhere near the bottom.
Now you're going to sell your coins to those who were patient and disciplined enough to not mortgage their house to go all in at or near the ath. Then when we do hit 100k in like 3 or four years you will sell whatever shit you have left to again go all in just before the next crash. Good luck dude.

Blockchain is garbage for any use other than Bitcoin. It's a very inefficient way of storing data. But this is acceptable for Bitcoin. All of these "use cases" of companies leveraging block chain to track manufacturing processes, shipments, etc are hilarious. They're just trying to throw new buzzwords around at problems better solved with a real database engine.

So said a lot of people when it was $20k/Bitcoin. "Oh man I wish it would crash to like $4k so I could load up".
$1k/Bitcoin is definitely possible, but better to DCA in case it starts another run up. If it keeps going down you will be getting more Bitcoin per dollar for each purchase.

I think the main school of thought is storing your bitcoin on an exchange (coinbase, gdax, etc) long term is a bad idea. 
1. Without the private keys, you technically don't have any bitcoin just a promise from a third party that they're keeping them safe for you.
2. What if said exchange is hacked and all coins are taken? What if said exchange suddnely goes out of business?
I'm sure there are other reasons, but those two come straight to my mind.

The only way it would is a hard fork that users supported. I'm sure some central bank will try it and fail at some point. It will be touted as the only way to save Bitcoin, the environment, or some other bs. Stay vigilant folks.

I thought that too when I started accumulating btc in 2013/2014 and right after I got into it the price plunged from over 1k all the way into the 200's by early 2015. Kinda lost interest but kept my coinage. In hindsight I really screwed up by not continuing to accumulate all throughout 2015-2017. I'm definitely sticking to a weekly schedule of small purchases for the next year or 2.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:07:15
Just threw another case of beer into bitcoin this AM as I do most Saturdays. Probably not going to get rich at this rate, but it keeps things interesting.

At this stage some speculation is almost guaranteed. And if greed gets some people into crypto and they stay because they learn about and become passionate about the tech thats all good. If speculators come in and make things wildly volatile thats all good too. Buy the dips bro :)

Sad thing is the largest players in money laundering are the people who are supposed to be stopping it with KYC/AML...HSBC anyone? And they're using fiat to do it, not BTC. If I'm laundering money I don't want those transactions to be recorded on a permanent, immutable, public ledger with countless copies of it that is distributed globally. Instead I would leave it to the professionals with private ledgers that can be manipulated. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:56:46
Even companies well known for accepting crypto (overstock dot com) have stated it is a small percentage of their sales. However, I know I heard the overstock guy say that they only convert half of the bitcoin to fiat and "bank" the rest. If they have in fact been doing that, I would imagine the banked coins have made them a VERY nice profit.
@_date: 2019-09-11 00:58:55
Ummmmm you clearly don't Bitcoin. What fucking "admin" is gonna empty your account? There's no admin or any accounts. There is only addresses. If you keep your key secure then coins residing in your address are more secure than funds in any other account.
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:39:26
The boring stores of value? I have some of them too, real estate, gold etc. Sure they are more stable. But they haven't performed anywhere near what Bitcoin has for me personally. To each their own I reckon.

Unless the peers have channels open with each other, won't they still rely on other nodes (middlemen) to route the transaction?

@_date: 2018-03-19 02:15:00


Sure, they handle more "transactions". But when you buy something from a store with Visa the transaction appears instant, but the store doesn't get their hands on anything liquid for like a month. Buy something with bitcoin they have something liquid in a matter of minutes.
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:40:42
It depends. If they're trying to mine and sell mined coins for a profit every week/month, then no they'll likely never recoup their investment. However, if they bought their gear and are HODLing their mining rewards it may actually pay off. I still have the coins mined with a butterfly labs in 2014. Even with this bear market they're worth way more than the miner and electricity i used to get them. Pretty nuts to think I was getting .01 BTC everyday back then.
@_date: 2018-07-01 02:07:57
The theory (I think) is that with an ETF, traditional "investors" will be buying mass amounts of bitcoin. ETFs are considered well-regulated and will help to further legitimize bitcoin. Supposedly the ETF will actually have the coin, so if there is large interest, there may be a rise in price. Institutions and older or non-tech savvy people may find them attractive options to gain exposure to bitcoin market without worry of securing private keys. Think about rich older folks who wanted to buy during last bull run, but didn't understand it. Now they can call their broker/financial adviser and say "get me half a million in this bitcoin ETF nonsense". If you're like me though, you won't find them all that attractive because not your keys...well you know the deal.

Buy a small amount and use it to learn how to secure a wallet and perform transactions. Research more. If you think it is good investment, sell the land and buy bigger chunks of bitcoin. IMO in its current state, it is not for everyone. So better to test the water before diving in head first.

It's happened countless times throughout history with regard to fiat. I think it very unlikely it will happen to gold. Or Bitcoin for that matter.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:32:16
The future financial world will CLEARLY be very different from the one we know today.
A world where bitcoin supplants fiat, inherently implies things will be very different. The way we think of wages, saving, investment, and interest will be flipped completely upside down. Or at the very least changed so much that many facets of the financial industry either no longer exist or are unrecognizable from their current forms. 
In a world built on deflationary currency, sure not many will want to loan at 1% interest rate when 1% of loans default. Maybe loans will be less prevalent. Would that be such a bad thing if the world was paid for with real money? 
Perhaps the only loans that occur are for large businesses. They take loans from those with large amounts of bitcoin to build their business, in exchange they give the creditor a share of the company.
But oh my god, how will people afford to buy houses or cars? With a deflationary currency, saving for large purchases suddenly seems within reach for the average person. Maybe we all start living within our means.
The future will definitely be interesting whatever happens.

almost everyone you know does not necessarily equate to "most people". 
"most people" will eventually want to/need to learn how to use this stuff at some point anyway. And it will get easier in time. Already has in the last few years with hardware wallets and decent mobile wallets for pocket money.
I am not planning on getting in on the ETF, its not for me. But I know some older, non-tech people who are ready to get in on it via their normal broker. If it ever gets approved, it will be a great on ramp for many whose capital would not find bitcoin. And that's fine too. To each their own.

The passphrase is like the master key. Which provides access to all the private keys to addresses you create with the wallet.

I think those advocating for a universal basic income are just plain lazy or severely misguided.

Never used Robinhood. The whole point to me is being able to xfer those funds to a real address that I control the keys to. Otherwise your buying/selling IOUs. If that doesn't bother you then go for it. But I like to buy my shit then lock it away for a few years.

Yes! BTW this is "low hanging fruit" that crypto should have no problem disrupting the incumbents. Especially with fees as low as they are and LN coming down the pipe. Why a Ugandan working in Spain would want to pay several parties to send money back home is beyond me. 
Make no mistake though, remittances are like several hundred billions in USD annually. Sooner or later the folks sending/receiving them HAVE to figure out they can ditch all the middlemen when sending money home. Its no low hanging fruit monetarily speaking either according to the world banksters:
" India was the largest remittance receiving country, with an estimated $72 billion in 2015, followed by China ($64 billion), and the Philippines ($30 billion)."

Yea, if your employer matches 401K I would recommend maxing it out. If they don't I would still put some in there. Having a low percentage of income/wealth going into bitcoin is also desirable for me.

Yup some of my colleagues FOMO'd, bought in at 19k and then sold on the way down at 10k.
When it was just over 6k I told one of my buddies I was buying more. He was like, "Isn't it down right now? I'll buy more when it goes back up." &lt;facepalm&gt;
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:55:19
EXACTLY! Whether it was a 5%, 10%, or 100% haircut. Its still theft. Remember, only put into banks what you can afford to have taken away. Buy more Bitcoin.

No thanks. I'll keep my gold AND my btc. Diversity FTW. I believe in btc, that doesn't guarantee its success long term. Hence I would like some other assets you know, just in case.

You can also just buy and hold bitcoin for a few years. Once your 1500&amp; up, tell Buffet, mainstream financial "gurus", and other naysayers to suck it...That's what I did. And will continue to do. We'll see who is right in a few years. The last 4 years have been fucking AWESOME for me financially and mainly due to getting into bitcoin. So keep chasing Buffet, his super creepy looking right-hand man Charlie, and the other "Oracles". 
@_date: 2019-09-11 01:12:43
If your concerned w long term price, either this is good, for example institutions buy because now they can store it somewhere "safe". Or these mofos get hacked and lose everyone's ass. But end of the day Bitcoin don't care. The network will keep functioning. Blocks will keep getting found and you'll theoretically be able to xfer funds anywhere you want without permission for the foreseeable future. That's worth a lot to humanity I think.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:06:57
Yup. Maybe they're not spending bitcoin for bread etc. thus the low transaction numbers. Maybe they're turning fiat into btc and simply hodling it.

Which is why its so exciting to watch it develop. Just think in 18 or so years we'll be talking about the good ol' days when only a small number of people even knew how to send/receive bitcoin.

I think if you hang out on any golf course long enough you may find a "disproportionate" number of tax cheats as well. Mitt Romney only paid 14% tax on his 22 million USD income. Considering I paid 30% on my little ass income I feel he is a cheater. Granted he didn't evade taxes, he just has the means to hire someone to find all the fucking loopholes...if the system is rigged, aren't the ones gaming it the cheaters?
To me the tax code needs to be greatly simplified. Income tax should go away completely imho. But if it cant, then lets make it simple/fast for people to pay them. Every year I spend an entire afternoon of my life filing/paying taxes. Yet I paid taxes all year long out of every paycheck...that seems fucking absurd to me. Pretty sure our founding fathers are hoping the USA burns so we can try again and hopefully get it right next time.

Really you're pulling it from the bank's pocket and putting it in your pocket. Theoretically it should have zero impact on the market as those coins have already been "bought".

Bitcoin is currently inflating and will continue to do so for a long long time. Albeit inflating less and less as time goes on.
It's inflation is completely predictable which is not a bad thing.
