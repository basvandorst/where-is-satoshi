What a nightmare
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:40:22

I bought at different points in 2017 at an average of $k 11.4. I’m in this for the long term but still the last two years have been a nightmare. I wish we would go back over 11.4 once for all.

Is this nightmare ever gonna end?

@_date: 2019-02-21 12:20:54

@_date: 2019-12-04 19:43:24
