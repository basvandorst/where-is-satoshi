I did say to him right at the end "Ok then once you have deposited the 0.1 btc let me know!" He probably would have had an answer for that too, but i was bored so i started telling everyone on discord and told Laki i would report every fake website i could find!

Ubfortunatly i dont have the links for the resultd any more as i cleared my cache straight after it happened, have tried again since but they must have moved on to a different URL now :(

Aahh yes i see what you mean! The initial message is a bit confusing then, as it says "But since i'm from china, i was blocked from all crypto exchanges..." making it seem like they cant withdraw because they cant access the account, or maybe i just got confused haha

Hey yes that is almost exactly the same! Looks like they were using a different crappy website though. Clearly quite a few bad actors involved, and they have lots of url's pointing at the same fake sites! I think probably the easiest way to spot it search the name of the fake site and its actually hard to get a good result even in google.

Yes mate tell them where to go!! :D luckily the site didn't have any new malware or anything, just some poor coding skills and zero effort haha

Definitly the right thing to do! I admit at first i honestly did think it was one of my users, and genuinly wanted to help - never felt worse about trying to help someone!

I know thats the first blunder on their part as why would you need to make an account to send them their money from their own account!? They said something to me like they would transfer it, but then how can they if they cant access it? Haha
