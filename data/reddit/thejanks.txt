TIL. 
Looked at my wallet and it is NOT HD. 
Guess I should read up what that is all about, as my wallet started in 2013 but it didn't see activity for several years.

Of course, if someone kidnaps him thinking he's got half a billion dollars, and beats the living shit out of him over and over, sooner or later he's going to say, "OK OK I'M SATOSHI PLEASE STOP HITTING ME" then Newsweeks can run another issue saying he admitted it.

Hell, if you got a handfull of deposit slips, you could just go through the drive thru! 
Then you sit and wait and time your bitcoin purchase --- unlike BitInstant.

Look at user bitinstant all up in here, doing customer service. 
I'm impressed.

I traded penny stocks a few years ago, and I have an itch knowing what lies ahead. 
First, everything right now is up, up, and up. People are overall giddy and happy, and those that are upset are ones who are dealing with overworked exchanges/companies to get their bitcoins. We're in the euphoria phase. Hell, a good deal of people are in the kool-aid phase. 
There's one rule of rules in penny stocks - don't drink the kool-aid. For those that don't know what that means, [learn something new]( Second, I always looked at it like a pack of wild animals. When you are outrunning the predator, you only need to outrun someone running away alongside you. 
That said, when a market correction comes (no question of if, it's WHEN), it has the potential to go from ugly to fucking-ugly. It took me 12 hours to get my bitcoins yesterday through bitinstant. We've read of other exchanges taking multiple hours. Hell we're reading of messed up order backlogs stemming multiple days. They are doing their best with the tremendous volume being thrown at them, now imagine another great volume of trading being thrown at them, but this time in the opposite direction?
This could get even worse, when all these people that honestly didn't know what they were getting into, but wanted to be part of it step back and ask, "Ok, so how do I spend these?" and find it isn't up to their expectations? They step back and realize, "What do you mean the government won't help me if I get hacked/scammed/computer crash?" 
One of my favorite quotes of all time is from Men in Black, "A person is smart -- people are dumb panicky animals". 
That saying was tried and true over and over when I was doing penny stocks, and I feel with 99% certainty we're going to see it here.

Maybe that's why it's gone from 90 to 93 quickly. People rushing to buy and transfer out. 
It's what I did &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:50:25
Looking at Bitfloor - it seems they are still able to take my money and get coins. 
I'll wait a few hours and see if anyone else finds out otherwise. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:46:43
They show a transfer OUT of my bitcoins, but not showing up in blockchain. 
Here's hoping you do get it all the way out.

I rolled into Bank of American and threw $300 towards bitfloor. 
I got back form lunch, and it was already in my account. Buying went quick and smooth. 
This was while their site being hit by DDOS and it going down repeatedly. Just bought my bitcoins, waiting for it to become available to transfer out. 
Impressed. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:19:48
There is a valid point of there being only 21 million coins, and coins DO GO MISSING. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:16:55
When I used to do penny stocks, I would average down (buy more at this lower rate), then if it goes up even half to where it was - you broke even. 
Many people really lose their pants when it goes down again, and they average down again. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:09:37
It doesn't matter if everyone and their mother will take bitcoins if it's not quick, cheap, and easy to get bitcoins. 
I'm slowly watching Dwolla approve me so I can get set up with MtGox, I haven't had the greatest experience with bitinstant, and we lost a few easy routes in the past few weeks. 
If things don't improve, you're not going to see more and more people taking up buying goods with bitcoins, which is a bummer. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:49:11

Walk into Bank of America, hand over cash and a deposit slip. They don't need any of my personal information.
Fuck yeah the government doesn't like that
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:13:05
I did them yesterday, and it was within 2 hours I got the email saying everything was executed, but then 12 hours with my link to coinapult. 
I was about to try bitfloor, but it seems everyones experiencing some DDOS today, so it's hard to say who's better with all the stress of market orders/DDOS/multiple days of non stop work. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:48:07


I sold $25 cards for $24 or less right off. Folks may not trust a new vendor, so you gotta give them something enticing like a discount. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:07:05
Same here. Bitfloor seems best today. 
HOWEVER, my dollars are still tied up after the purchase, and no bitcoins have been added to my account yet - so I haven't been able to transfer them to my wallet yet. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:49:16
It doesn't matter how many times you say, "Don't invest what you can't afford to lose", people get greedy.

Can't even retrace the page now to spell it out, but basically went into the buy area, threw in my arbitrary number of bitcoins, was quoted the going rate, and hit buy. 
Saw the ticker at the bottom fly and several partials to accumulate the total of my buy, and done. USD was removed from my available balance and moved into holding, but bitcoins didn't go up from 0.000000000000
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:56:46
Heck, seems this is just one of a few things for big money.

You know, I heard of bitcoin years ago, but didn't get into it. 
Then with the mad rush lately, I took a second look. I found the whole process of online anonymity and programs involved extremely interesting, almost more than the whole bitcoin process -- solely because one way or other other, CISPA is going to get shoved down our throats sooner or later. I've actually learned more about doing the normal stuff I want to do online without anyone knowing jackdiddly, that I don't have to worry about the government wondering why I'm googling "how to fist a cow with a horse mask on both feet". 
Thanks to bitcoin mining, I got some free measly bitcoins (.10 so far) that I can actually play around with the bitcoin business while learning all this business. 
Right now, I'm totally stuck on paper wallets, and google is slowly showing me the way. If and when this stuff goes mainstream, I'll hopefully be several steps ahead in security.

"We are aware some users are experiencing issues with holds on their account. We are working quickly to resolve these problems. I can assure all users that funds and deposits are safe" 
Top of their page now, when it actually loads. 
edit : they are available, and transferred out.

I went to CVS a few hours ago, and right not just waiting on the email from coinapult, emails show everything else has gone through smooth.

Bitcoins on hold being transferred out. 
Son of a bitch, glad I caught up at work and decided to look here. I may have to tip you later if this gets moved out. 
edit : bitfloor says they are out, but it's not showing up on the blockchain.

Done. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:40:08
It took 5 hours, but the bitcoin transfer showed up at blockchain after 4 hours, and confirmed in 1. 
They still got 65 cents of my money, a tip for their previous services.

That and it seems there's DDOS attacks all around. Bitfloor was down some time ago, others in my thread (now deleted) MtGox was down for awhile. I just checked, and Slush's fund website for miners is down. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:41:45
No shit, one does not simply just sit down, get bitcoins, hit up the silk road and click send in a day. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:32:06
Bitinstant is a bit overloaded (who isn't), but I got set up quick enough. 
Get a wallet set up, do a cash deposit with Bitinstant, sending the money straight to your wallet, or what I did - to an email. Then transfer from that email to your wallet. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:05:14

It took awhile, but bitinstant worked for me today. 
I did bitcoin to email. It took 1 hour for the emails to show up confirming payment, and then another 9 hour delay receiving the email on getting the bitcoins from coinapult. By habit, I had my eyes on the junkmail box, where that important email came. 
May just have to use it again.

Well, bitinstant is still up, but I wanted to try something else for comparison.
