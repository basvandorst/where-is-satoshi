By all means go ahead.

I'm not a trader, never claimed I was. I'm an incoming IB analyst.
WoWS, mind you, is retail sales. That has nothing to do with trading
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:30:29
This never happened.
BTC was criticized for being a terrible currency, not a speculative asset.
You can trade corn and carbon credits; speculation doesn't exist solely in the realm of stocks and fixed income
This is a result of CME and CBOE futures.

What's funny is he's trying to crap on me when I'm an incoming Investment Banking Analyst.
I'm well beyond the point of employment. If you're job *starting pay all-in* is 120k+ then come back to me. By the time I'm 30 (his presumable age) I'll be making well over 350k, no grad school needed.
I'm not even trying to brag, just set the record straight.

there are subs for this I think. randomactsofpizza or someshit
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:03:59
The hope they have now is with BTC becoming normalized through Nasdaq and the CME's respective futures market. I think BTC traders can *attempt* to make BTC a gold-esque hedging asset as opposed to a currency.
probably not.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:55:07
little late on that bud. sell your house and load up on BTC future come January
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:47:50
What's funny is they're only hurting themselves.
Most Bulge bracket banks admit there is merit in trading BTC. I agree. You can trade any asset, people trade fucking corn, rates and carbon credits. There are weather derivatives on whether it'll rain or snow. There are derivatives on whether some third party with no relevance to you will default. 
But for whatever reason they seem hell bent on making it look that much more irrational

You cannot deduce correlations based of charts.
I fell into this trap when i first started crack spread trading. You need to find the hedge ratio and covariance of the pair. I still do the "poor man's" hedge ration by using recursive regression as opposed to a proper filter like a kalman fitter

alternative asset management exists. I don't know why you're singing out long only, passive funds catering to pensions funds to make BTC seem sexier

Difference is I have TMT M&amp;A and rates desk experience. The bulk of this sub thinks trading 1k accounts on robinhood and BTC makes them knowledgeable. You're the descendants of the snakeoil TA signal followers of the early 2000s.

The state doesn't control monetary policy. The Fed is privately owned and monetary policy is done without government say.
Aka, not communism.
The buying and selling of investment bank derives securities to effect interest rates is about an uncommunist as you can get

BTC isn't an efficient market.
Other markets have efficiency issues as well. This is very apparent in G10 FX which allows for trend following to be more profitable than any other asset class. For the longest time past returns were indicative of future returns. Not as strong as it was pre-2009 when everything regime changed and became more mean reverting.

Excellent analysis.
This is usually the part where the idiots with the 1k accounts start accusing me of being bitter as if the ability to make returns, indefinitely, on an asset somehow makes it a viable currency.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:45:58
And this is supposed to mean what exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:36:14
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:11:35
but currencies indefinitely rising with no real fundamental shift or practical use in the real world is good. The evin central banksters are the cause of all dysfunction. the blockchain nerda told me.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:33:29
I'm not in the least bit bitter. Trade futures (energy, financial and currency index), every now and then the SPY and have a bag hold account on coinbase. I make a solid 500$ a day on futures and bought BTC back at 8,000$
Unlike you, I actually manage real money. But that is besides the point. Making money isn't proof to BTC's viability.
