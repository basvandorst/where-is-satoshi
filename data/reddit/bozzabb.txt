Serious question: Why does my €1 Cheeseburger, that has always been €1 traditionally in in the Eurozone, cost €1.29 in Germany in 2017? 
The price has been going up slowly and steadily on the €1 menu here.

You do realise that there are extortionate fees associated with international PayPal and bank wire transfers!
I am not even speaking about the rip off forex rates!

If I had to guess, I'd say miners are a program, from the Machine world. But if that's true, that could mean miners are part of the system, another kind of control. I suppose the most obvious question is: how can I trust miners?
 It is a pickle, no doubt about it. Bad news is there's no way you can
really know if  miners are here to help you or not, so
it's really up to you. Just have to make up
your own damn mind to either accept what
I'm going to tell you, or reject it. Candy?
