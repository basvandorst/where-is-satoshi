Sure, I could do that. For the sake of my moral compass and philosophical consistency, however, I will not. My argument is precisely that Bitcoin **is** a bubble, and the value of it is baseless.

Bitcoin has value because people are willing to pay for it, **at the moment**. 
Consider items of unrealistic value that have seen similar price spikes:
* beanie babies
* collectible/trading cards
* swarovski crystals
Bitcoin has a real potential to join the ranks.

Bitcoin has none of the characteristics of currency, and is instead an asset. This particular asset is intangible, and largely unrecognized. Through the eyes of a traditional investor, this is a game of timing the market.
