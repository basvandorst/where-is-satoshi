What about [0, ∞]? Yeah I know it is not mathematically correct but if the USD is worth nothing at all then the value of BTC is USD is not defined anymore (as a real number) which is somewhat the same as saying it is equal to infinity.

Bitcoins being useful is awesome. Who cares if it goes to the moon or not as long as it is useful to some people !
Moreover bitcoin has value because of its potential usefulness. If this potential usefulness never really concretizes, the price will crash.

But what if Earth does a 51% attack on the Mars blockchain? If computation is cheaper on earth it is likely to happen. How do you keep a blockchain from going to the place where computation is the cheapest?

So the conclusion is that we need another hard fork to fix it? I'm saying it half jokingly but I think it's true. We should not be so scared of hard forks that we stop improving Bitcoin when it needs it.

When bitcoin goes into ATH territory, we get lost, we have no reference for what the price should be, so people just buy until it crashes. So no not just any rise is a bubble, but pretty much all the ATH are bubbles.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:00:22
It is not? It look very much like the previous bubbles. But bubbles are how bitcoin gets mainstream adoption. I cannot imagine the price going up to 10 000$ and just staying there, it seems much more likely that it would go to 30 000$ and then back to 10 000$ when the bubble burst. Nobody knows the real value of a bitcoin, so how can we not overshoot ourselves in our enthusiasm/greed? Or it could bust tomorrow and go back to a thousand. Both seem very unlikely to me though, something between those two seems much more probable.

Bitcoin does not need to do everything but it needs to be useful in the real world. It has value because people imagine that it will because really useful in the real world at some point. We cannot give up on that.
If you are against increasing the block size at all you should say so more clearly and not say that there could be a size increase at a later date. I have heard of no one supporting this kind of proposal. As you said if some people wanted the hard fork to be really safe it should be planned a long time in advance and yet no one is planning. The people that want bigger blocks seems alright with supporting the hard fork in November. And it is only the people that don't want bigger blocks that says we all want bigger blocks only later.
I am not a strong supporter of bigger blocks. I am very excited that we are (most probably) going to get segwit soon. And I'm way more excited about the lightning network that the hard fork in November. What I care most of all is not having a hard fork that splits bitcoin in November. And right now I feel that this is what is happening. You seem to care about planning hard forks in advance and yet not to care at all that the hard fork that is planned for November will split bitcoin more badly than any badly planned hard fork could do.
Maybe you are right and saying people not to follow the hard fork is the right way to go to minimize damage. I'm not convinced yet. I still feel that going through with it would be the better path for bitcoin in the long run.

You were. I haven't sold any yet. I still think the bubble is not finished. Maybe I should sell some though. I'm not as confident as I was this morning that it will go above 3000$. It still seems likely but maybe I should cash out at least a little bit in case it does not.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:43:16
Care to explain why you feel than 2018 / 2019 or 2020 would be a better time to do it than November 2017. I feel like the opposite is true. I feel that a blocksize increase is needed before a lightning network become really popular and widely used. In the meantime it is important to have low enough fees so that bitcoin real world usage may continue to grow. Real world usage is in great part what makes bitcoin more valuable than other cryptos like litecoin. If bitcoin stop being usable to buy games on steam for example because of high fees, sellers will find another cryptos and bitcoin will lose a lot of its value. In 2020 we may have a lightning network and no need at all for bigger blocks. So I feel that you saying that you want bigger blocks later is just a delaying tactics to a point where they will no longer be needed. My worry is that at the point where bigger blocks are no longer needed an other crypto will have replaced bitcoin for real world payments.

UASF without a majority is worse than a hard fork. It puts the entire chain at a risk of a reorg, which is worse for users than a hard fork. With a hard fork the users staying on the old chain can keep using their coin if they want to. With a reorg the users staying on the old chain will see the bitcoin they received disappear when the reorg happened. So if core supported a hard fork to bigger blocks it would really not be an issue, it would have 99% hash power, the official client supporting it. So I find it dishonest of them to say that they don't want to hard fork to bigger blocks because the hard fork is a risk. The hard fork is only a risk if they don't support it.
Not that the miners are doing much better. They should have supported segwit a long time ago because it already mean bigger blocks. I feel like both parties are being dishonest and just want power.

Because of problems with banks there is no USD in or out of the exchange. At first people were selling to get their bitcoins out of the exchange, but now there is not enough fiat entering the exchange for the price to go up.

The 40% signaling Segwit are not signaling BIP148, they will follow the longest chain. They will not mine segwit blocks until the threshold of 80% is reached.

I agree, to me it looks like the beginning of a bubble not the end. But who knows, it may be wishful thinking.


It would be the mother of all bubbles? 
But I do not see those levels of adoption happening, and bitcoin is definitely not ready for this. Imagine what the rise in price and popularity will do to the transaction fees... People would not buy bitcoin if it means paying a hundred dollar per transaction! In a year, if we have a functional LN and bigger blocks then it is possible. For the time being not so much.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:34:53
But you could have said the same in 2013, and people were actually saying the same thing in 2013. And yet it was a bubble, bitcoin was not yet ready for this price. In the end, given the amount of demand from buyer and offer from miner and ordinary sellers the price could not sustain itself above a thousand. Now we are ready for more, because there was a halfening (so the offer from miners just got divided by two) and because there is a wider adoption. So we need to discover the new price where offer meets demand. Except that all the ATH news created a temporarily higher demand, which will makes us go above the equilibrium price before going back to it.

Most currencies are not accepted everywhere in the world! You have to convert them first. Yeah bitcoin hasn't replace the dollar yet, it does not mean that it isn't a currency.
It's even in the name cryptocurrency : a currency based on cryptography.

I completely agree that we need a lightning network. But it does not mean that 2x is useless in the meantime. It means bitcoins can get more users while a lightning network get finished and start getting used by sellers.
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:30:57
There is no one place that accept bitcoin everywhere, but overall there are more places that accept bitcoin (especially online) than many other currencies. I think that the idea that you need a location to define a currency is something of the past. Moreover if a currency does not have one of the many things that define a currency it is still trying to be a currency. If a currency is being strongly devaluated then it is not stable, yet it is still a currency, a failing currency I admit but still a currency.
Bitcoin is the same, it is failing in some area but strong in other. And in my opinion high fees makes bitcoin much less of a currency than it already was.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:27:32
Backward compatibility with a chain split and later the invalidation of the minority chain is actually worse for users than simply a hard fork. It means that everything seems to be working but that at some unknown point in the future all their transactions can be invalidated. And no the responsibility is not only to the ones refusing the softfork. I could create a really stupid soft fork tomorrow and it would make sense for everyone to refuse it. 
Not that Segwit is stupid, that's not the point of my argument. Trying to impose a softfork when there is no consensus is much more risky than a hardfork. Especially when there is no consensus from the miners because they are the ones who at first will decide how the softfork goes at first. UASF may have been needed, but pretending it is the safe and responsible way to go and then say that we must refuse to take any risk at all is just ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:01:03
It's easy to have fewer transactions when the transaction fees become really expensive. If we had really low transaction fees then the transactions would exceed bitcoin capacity. 
If you can't use bitcoin as a currency but only as a store of value then yes we have enough capacity. But bitcoin has value because it can be used as a currency, because it is actually useful to people, to buy stuff, to send money to a friend. I definitely don't expect bitcoin to remain valuable in the long run if it cannot be used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:34:14
The things you cannot do with regular fiat currencies are what make bitcoin an awesome and valuable currency. Still in the end if it stops being usable as a currency then those other things are not that useful by themselves.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:56:26
It is a currency. I can buy quite a lot of things with bitcoin. Or I can pay back a friend by sending him some bitcoins. Only high fees are limiting its usefulness as a currency.

Both sides have been dicks. Or I should say the most vocal proponents of both sides have been dicks.
Where did I ever say that they are more valuable than Core? I said that their point of view is valuable too.
How is bitcoin supposed to change humanity if it isn't useful to people and therefor has an economic value?
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:57:57


The obligation, seriously? Legal ? Moral ? Bitcoin is supposed to be all about people only needing to act in their own best interest for it to work.
Some of them don't want to do the softfork because of asicboost, and that would really suck if it meant that bitcoin cannot move forward anymore. But they are not the majority. Segwit2x will break asicboost and yet most miners are signaling for it. It would seem that they are truly in favor of bigger blocks, probably because bigger blocks could mean lower fees and make it possible for bitcoin to be used more as a currency and less as a store of value. They may not see as long term as most core developers do but it does not mean that we should not listen to them at all. Miners may be actually more connected to the various economic pressure that make Bitcoin valuable/useful than the core developers are. 


They require a majority support from miners, which SegWit does not have yet. Or else you get a chain split and then later transactions getting cancelled which is worse for users than a hardfork. Users that have not updated their software would stay on the old chain receive bitcoins and then see those bitcoin disappear when suddenly the softfork becomes the longest chain.

But imagine that computing power is much cheaper on Earth. Earth could do a kind 51% attack on Marscoin, in fact if you have 51% of the mars computing power you could suddenly move all the mined blocks to earth. Making the money much more cumbersome to use on mars but earning some precious marscoins in the process.

Trusting the central entity to validate who are electors is one thing because you will know if people are being refused their right to vote and you will probably notice if the total number of voters is way to high. So you have means of control (not a perfect control but still pretty good).
Now if the central entity is responsible for counting the votes, controlling that is way harder.
I'm not saying that the blockchain is the best way to go (I really don't know), just that trying to decentralize is a good idea.

I bought some pizzas with bitcoin yesterday and I do expect bitcoin to be worth more in a months. If I want more bitcoins I can just send more fiat to an exchange. In fact that's what I did this morning.
