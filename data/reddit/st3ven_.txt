GVT is a little bit different from what I believe this will be. From what I can see, they're not a full fledged data platform like the likes of Bloomberg/Reuters..

Maybe? No, not really :). We'll be charging a low and fair pricing and for early adopters, we'll keep it low forever.

thanks mate!

Hey thanks for the tip again; As a couple of guys have mentioned, I'll try to figure out how to include subreddits as well into the picture :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:55:46
I'll work on some kind of minimum size for the headlines so that it'll show only tiles with headlines that are legible. thanks for your feedback :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:42:46
You can simply hover through the small boxes and it'll show you the contents of it in detail. Thank you for your feedback again :)

The size of the panels depend on the number of clicks and the number of sources that are talking about the same article. Basically, the more bigger the article, the more important it is.
Okay, let me see if there's something I can do to mathematically prevent that from happening. Thanks for your feedback :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:54:53
It is based on that! I'll make the ranking algorithim a bit more transparent; but basically the bigger the square, the more sources that are talking about the same article and the more views the article has..
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:04:59
I'm thinking of adding a few customization options as well :) It's right now not mobile friendly but we're trying to figure out ways to see if we can pack all the tiles in a mobile. the main problem is that there isin't much realestate for mobile to show all the tiles (maybe vertical scrolling there could help?).
thanks for your feedback :) Also do try our mobile app! 
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:54:01
I get where you're coming from. In mobile esp. this is an issue. The site was designed for desktop first; I'll add some rules to make it behave like this in mobile. thanks for your feedback :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:01:13
no worries; every person is different :) We have also been working on a really nice mobile app that keeps things in a simple to read vertical list? Open this link in mobile 
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:50:57
I actually can! thanks for noting these points out. We're going to add an options to customize the interface a bit more, with even options to choose the font as well. Back in 2004, the newsmap.jp site (from which we've taken inspiration from) had got the exact same options.

Hey, what's wrong with the color scheme? is it confusing? or inaccurate? or hard to see?
Each color represents a category and the darkness of the color represents age. The older the article, the more darker it is.
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:02:19
EDIT: yes, in fact some news aggregators don't rank the articles properly, nor do I like scrolling them much. Which is why I'm a big fan of newsmap.jp before it went defucnt. You didn't need to scroll at all, and you'd get a full download of what's happening in just one glance..
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:20:03
Oh wow; I actually did not consider color blindness. I should add an option to switch to some kind of 'color-blindness' mode right away. Thank you for explicitly mentioning that to me
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:43:26
Haha! XD. yes, delete reddit..
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:13:39
yes and in general, crypto needs a good and simple to use news aggregator. There are a few guys doing something already, but no one is doing something as cool as a heatmap :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:53:03
Haha, thank you for that tip! I'm adding that right away :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:15:58
Oh hey, wonderful! I am definitely going to get a design firm to come and help me with UI/UX of it. Right now since we're just a startup we can't afford an expensive team. But I too stand for high quality. I hope you can use the mobile app for the meanwhile? Our news engine picks up articles and understands and ranks them pretty well.
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:02:35
thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:52:35
thanks for the feedback! :) I too think vertical scroll makes a lot of sense for mobile. thanks again!
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:41:59
hey! that's actually not a bad idea! thanks :D
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:05:24
Thank you so much! and please leave your suggestions for any improvements as well :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:42:11
thanks! there's a lot of hard work gone into it :'D
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:38:35
guys; let me know what you think. any feedback or suggestions would be greatly helpful!
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:46:58
Hey! We just did :) thanks for the suggestion
