Not sure if funding will be possible in the near term but would love to be able help if there are other ways. Shoot us an email - info

You are right. Let's not do this because of the amount of paperwork....

The money is a small portion of our offering. What the companies find most valuable is the network surrounding the accelerator. We bring in relevant entrepreneurs/investors to help with the process of building a company.
We also provide free housing and office space in the silicon valley for the duration of the program. Being around a bunch of other bitcoin companies in this live/work environment is also extremely valuable to learn from each other.

This will be a must! When you find this let me know.

We do not. We do prepare people for larger rounds. Bitcoin companies coming out of Boost have raised much larger rounds after the three month program

bitme.com by Vaurum is the best way to trade large blocks

VC is a tough business to get into. The typical VC's I see today either first went through a banking career, had a previous successful company IPO/Acquisition or started a VC on their own. My advice would be to reach out to as many VC's as possible and ask advice on how they got into the space. 
Maybe try to do work for free and see if you could potentially do due diligence on companies for them. Especially if you are knowledgable on bitcoin, many are looking to learn more and understand the space.

looking forward to checking it out!

I really like this idea and would love to meet someone working on it!

These guys are marketing geniuses. Remember  and  and

Is this going to be an actual exchange or more like a coinbase?
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:10:50
Have seen them. I will reach out!
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:57:00
Definitely! Shoot an email to info and that will go straight to me

Then more bitcoiners should start using Medium!

A year ago we said we were going to start investing in bitcoin companies. Over the past year we have built an extremely valuable network for any person who wants to work on bitcoin. We only became more and more excited about the space over this time and we are in a position to throw a large amount of support it's way. We think the companies that come into Boost will benefit greatly from the large Boost bitcoin community!

Are we completely ruling out that bitcoin is pixie dust?

I hope someone creates a Santa Tracker for Satoshi!

Jackson is a great guy. Definitely unfortunate to lose him as a cryptocurrency advocate. He was an awesome optimist and I do think we need to get more of those into the space

Although regarding time, the one thing that bitcoin has that the internet didn't have... is the internet.

Alpha version was released today on their website -  - using Bitcoin testnet

I posted this yesterday from the Boost VC office in San Mateo during a Bitcoin meetup. They ran out of Thin Mints!

This happened all the time on Coinbase when they were getting started. Startups are doing their best to make it work but sometimes things don't work out as planned. We don't live in a risk-free world.
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:07:01
Still love watching these. Who is next!?
@_date: 2013-09-09 17:59:54
mind blown!
