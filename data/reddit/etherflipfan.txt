Do you publicly make it known you are into crypto?  How did this person know to target you?

Where are tether printing dates published?

It is automatic.  Welcome to GDAX.

Why does it have to be dust to track?
Can't you just see what transactions each wallet is making, looking for co-mingling/mixing with other wallets?
Whether they send your dust or their own money, it is still sent and tracked....

This is similar to one way the hustlers on the streets of the US take your money on 3 Card Monte.
They will only let you play for a high amount like $100.  
They will pay attention to see if you have several notes to make that $100.
They will go slow and let you easily follow the winning card.
Once you pick and pull out your money, they will crowd around you and tell you to count it.
As you and your friends are concentrating on counting the money, they switch the winning card to a different location.
You finish counting, they flip your chosen card, it is now the loser.
You walk away pissed that they hustled you.

So this is a scam in Canada, where people that had nothing to do with crypto start getting calls from people claiming to be with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
They say that they have a warrant for their arrest due to taxes.  They somehow get their caller ID to say they are from the police station.
They keep the pressure on until they convince the victim to deposit into legitimate bitcoin ATM'S to scammer's wallet, under the guise that it is for faster processing.  Once the deposit is made, they dissappear.
The Canadian police have even posted flyers at the ATM's, which is what OP was referring to as the sign for the warning.
From the article I read, the police are focusing more on prevention than capture, and they seem to know very little about crypto, saying that it is untraceable.

This is a very thorough and informative explanation of what happened, and why.  Thanks for the article!

I have both. 
Trezor is way more user friendly, but Ledger is integrated into more sites and exchanges....
It's a toss up, but Ledger is more capable.

Awesome read!
So the main argument is that a successful Dapp can be cloned/forked due to the open source nature of blockchain.
Therefore, there will be several clones of good dapps, all competing for the same userbase.
One factor that is not considered, is first mover advantage and loyalty.
1) There are many Dice games, but Etheroll is the volume king by a longshot.  Lots of loyalty and pride.  There is no other dice game that is even at 10% of their volume.
2) Before EtherDelta was sold and ran itself into the ground, it was king of the DEX's.  IDEX interface is superior, but only had 25% of Etherdelta's volume.  Like you wrote, forkdelta was a contentious fork of EtherDelta that only gained support due to the Etherdelta's self destruction. If Etherdelta did not run itself to the ground, it would still be on top despite its shortcomings as a DEX.
All in all great article!
Edit:grammar and spelling.

If they have a bit coin wallet, you just send it directly to them.

Fantasy football is considered a skill game, so you won't hit the same roadblocks as other gambling sites....

So every cold code kit is unique?
This is not a bad route to take.  Definitely better than just storing your keys in one place.
Great idea, wishing you success.
My only recommendation is redo the video with a better production value and presentation.
At the least, just redo it without the unnecessary pauses.

This is already possible, for several months now.
Unless they are talking about something else....

You can run a bot on IDEX, although they just instituted rules so that bots can't take advantage of the free order placement and cancellations.
It was a good decision for the overall trading experience.

Sorry for your loss.  I would try to report them to as many people as possible, such as what you are doing now.

Yeah this is a phishing attempt, they now have your log in info.  You need to contact Coinbase and change your password ASAP.
Enable 2fa with Google Authenticator if you plan on using Coinbase in the future.

Buying out the competition makes the most sense, and is what is done traditionally.

Better off just loading the wall let on another, safe computer.

Pretty cool!  What city?  Does it do KYC before making purchases?

Not only is it a great business for you to establish, but it is also a great billboard for crypto!
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:10:25
You cant back them up, but you can ensure 2FA, put it in your "vault", etc.  
Coinbase is a US based, regulated, very trustworthy site.  You do not have to worry about them trying to steal your coins.

You SHOULD be safe if you connected it, went to ledger website and generated a new seed....
But I would err on the side of caution and just buy off the ledger site.
Was there a scratch off or anything else in the package?

It is as safe as you are smart with your security.  Coinbase 2FA with Google Authenticator, with virus and malware free computer or phone and you are fine.
You can get a hardware wallet, but if you are sloppy with it you can lose it, lose your keys, etc.
It is very unlikely that coinbase will get hacked, or even leave you broke even if they do.
