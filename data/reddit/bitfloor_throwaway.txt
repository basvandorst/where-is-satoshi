Bank safety deposit box
Commit it to memory through pneumonics
Write it on the inside of a floorboard in your living room
Tattoo it on the inside of your intestines
All of these routes are safer than leaving your money on an exchange

Does Bitfloor sound familiar? Because the same thing happened to me. 45 coins. Gone. I have evidence and am considering putting together a class action proposal. I don't think they were "hacked". I think he's sitting on them.

Word. Just sold to get my principal back and will reinvest it on a drop. I believe in the tech; I just think it's getting dangerously artificially inflated.

Roman Shtylman. I tried to contact him about Bitfloor and he hung up on me. Something fishy happened and it was so long ago I never did anything about it.
Why no records? Everything should be on email. Do you not have access to that email anymore?

Damn. Alright. Yeah I'm salty too. He stole 45 coins from me.
I still have email exchanges and email receipts from purchases.
Let me know if you want me to keep you in the loop if I contact an attorney.

Yeah I actually have an email from him. See below:

Just curious if there is some kind of formula or schedule for repaying lost bitcoins as of the theft. I'm out 45 BTC that I would have loved to trade at this point. I understand it was a huge loss and the subsequent remedy schedule may be long, but I'm just curious as to when I could expect to see some/all of my BTC returned.

There is no formula and payouts will happen as the exchange is able to finance them. I expect that there will be monthly payouts but the amount is not predetermined. The only predetermined "formula" is that you will be payed out proportionally to the total amount lost and your individual loss.
So, basically, I have intent to repay directly from him. Which makes me think I have a case. But I'll consult with my buddy later today and keep you in the loop.

Do you have any proof that he stole them? 
Do you have proof of purchase on Bitfloor?
I am not (fortunately) broke af at the moment and I'm considering beginning to put together a case.

Yep that's my thought too. Fucking scumbag.
I'd like to go after him. I think I'm going to consult an attorney friend about it.
Worst comes to worst I get nothing.
