Surely it's an investment in the long run, and a currency, and smart contract fuel, and a protocol, and basically everything people want it to be.

Or better, increase the block size to potentially accommodate the same btc amount in transaction fees as the double of the new block reward. The transaction fee could be calculated averaging fees from blocks prior to the halving.

I mean is a poor analogy because of the fact that bitcoin being scarce doesn't mean its purchasing power is also limited like the value of the pizza. As a currency its value could grow so much that you could in practice use incredibly tiny amounts of it for your purchases.

That's how payment channels work, you lock some funds to a multisig account but only after the payee signs another transaction with nlocktime just in case he goes away without broadcasting any transaction (so the funds are not locked forever with the multisig). In this case I suppose the service was given and the outputs in the multisig were spent. Normally you shouldn't broadcast the nlocktime transaction if everything went fine.

if it's about satoshis, btc as a resource and just fuel for contracts then off-chain.

Fees have nothing to do with block space but with profitability of mining. If all transactions in a block had fees the miners will be getting around 20$ for them, in contrast with the ~5625$ from reward. Today miners are there for the reward, not for the fees, in order to have them there for the fees either we pay 0.02BTC per transaction or they pack much more transactions in a block, 250000 in fact if we want to keep paying 0.0001BTC fees.

Hash rate is crucial to secure the network, if the hash rate goes down substantially (and asics are sold cheap or given away) then there's more risk for a 51% attack.
We cannot predict the price of BTC in USD for that long time, but perhaps for the next halving the price will not have changed a lot (taking how little has it moved over the past year), that cut will hurt miners for sure if the price didn't go up and the fees continue to be as little as now.
I'm personally concerned about fees if the blocksize limit has not been raised and how the lightning network and sidechain settlement will deal with the high fees.

You can prove you own a private key which can spend from a given address by signing a message. Using bitcoin rpc:

What kind of data? Aren't blockchain analytics plenty of it? What I purpose is pegging the block size limit to the miner subsidy. In my opinion that's how much the blocks will have to grow in order to keep the mining industry healthy, the rest will have to be provided by off-chain payment networks.
