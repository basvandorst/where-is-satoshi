If you keep watching for a couple of minutes afterwards, you'll find out that Canada probably doesn't have near term plans to ban cash.

SW could help kick the scalability problem down the road a little bit, which is what all block size increase proposals are doing anyway.

Segregated Witness is a soft fork and would only require the consensus of a majority of miners.

Awesome post! Just goes to show that there is nothing "free market" about the banking system.

Before, I was reading that in order to receive a payment in lightning, you have to have a channel that already has an amount of funds equal to or greater than the amount to be received. Does anyone know if this is still the case, or if there is any research being done to mitigate this issue?

The issue is that Coinbase is not just an exchange, but also wants to act as a wallet. So, users will expect to be able to pay a merchant using Coinbase, and if you have to wait to match with other users that are also sending transactions your transaction wouldn't be able to be sent out immediately. That said, I see no reason for them to not implement batching for withdrawing from their exchange, GDax. They could also choose to only batch send from Coinbase when there is one or more transaction to pair with in the next few seconds to avoid wait time.

What you are describing is called RBF-FSS. You are free to lobby miners to adopt this policy if you like. Just because a given policy is merged in core does not mean that any given miner/node operator has to apply it.
