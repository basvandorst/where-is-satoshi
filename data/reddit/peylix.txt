I would dig your seed out and restore your wallet on a new device, then transferring your crypto to a brand new wallet as fast as possible.
Make sure to never use the previous one again as it's considered compromised.

Or use an exchange. Note that any exchange is going to need KYC verification for large sums. Most require a handful of withdraws and deposits before limits are raised, while even larger caps are lifted after manual activation by contacting support.

$20 is not worth moving at this point in time. 
I'd say $100 minimum if you are going to DCA. (Buy more within the next week or so). If $20 is all you're going to put in. Wait it out. Which might be a long time with all the FOMO going on.

This is a great option.
But with market volatility and speculation. That is a huge gamble. If that gamble is worth it, is up to the person making the choice.
Personally, I would only doing this if I had a fiat contingency fund stashed somewhere that gave me a buffer for recovery should shit go south.

I believe in both. I try to stray from getting involved with the major slap fight going on between both sides. BTC has some problems, but not irreversible.
But a lot of people don't understand that no matter what side you pick. The winner will be the one that has a tech that works. This is also something that will not be decided for some time. It's gonna be a bumpy road for both.

Use BitAddress and create a private key on an offline computer. You can either download their source to do this, or save the page as an html to your desktop, open it, disconnect your internet, generate, write it down and your seed by hand. Then you're set.

Coinbase charges fees for any transaction through them. Differences carry on method of payment (Card, Wire, Account, Paypal).
If you want to reduce fees. Wire a set amount to your USD Coinbase wallet, then transfer to an exchange like Gdax (Owned by Coinbase btw) or Gemini. Buying BTC through an exchange is market value vs Coinbase's inflated value+fees.
You pay for the convenience for instant BTC.
So you get more for doing the work (manually). 
 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:51:12
If you're lucky. When the traffic jams hit, fees skyrocket as people one up the previous high fee. At peak jam time, to actually get your  tx through at a reasonable timeframe, you needed to pay $50+. Or wait for 6+ hours with a fee of $25. 24+ hours with a fee of &lt;$10.
It's insane.  
Best advice is to hold off doing any tx during these huge peak times, find a time frame where it loosens up a bit and then do it.
That aside, if there ever is a massive panic sell. Shit is going to hit the fan. Can guarantee you fees will shoot to the moon, unless you have a huge holding, you will be priced out of even moving until the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:31:52
If you lose it, or it gets stolen. They have 3 tries to guess your PIN. If they fail, the device wipes itself. 
Losing the device itself wont matter. It's replaceable. As long as no one knows your PIN or can guess it. You're safe. If you think your PIN is compromised, use your seed to restore your wallet on any BIP39 compliant wallet as fast as you can. Many wallet apps and programs support BIP39. Then send your crypto to a new wallet created from a new seed. This will ensure they won't get your coins. Once your new Ledger arrives, create a new seed as the current one you used to save your funds was created on a hotwallet, which isn't as secure. Then transfer to the new Ledger.
What REALLY matters, is your seed. If someone gets that, it's all gone. So store it well.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:25:23
I have my seed etched in steel, and have several copies in 3 separate locations. 2 is 1, 1 is 0. Redundancy is key.
I have seen others split their seeds across locations too, so if someone finds one of your locations, they only have part of your seed. So there is that option as well.
I'm sure you'll figure out a good method though. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:06:15
When a panic sets. The exchanges grind to a halt. Transactions pool up too making them take a lot longer.
There really is no way to sell in a hurry currently other than keeping your BTC on the exchange (which is a no no).
Best advice, don't let dips panic you. HODL on your Nano S. BTC isn't going anywhere.

Correct as you have your seed written down. You can use that to restore your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:36:34
No, not all.
This depends on the developers of the wallet. So if you have alts that you're trying to save. Then make sure the new wallet supports said currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:30:47

Never sell Bitcoin as a money investment to family, friends, coworkers, strangers. Sell Bitcoin as a technology. Better yet, sell the technology behind it, Blockchain.
Teach them the history, why it was created, what it can do, how it's changed, whats to come both good and bad. Teach them about alts and other variances of Blockchain and others like DAGs.
Sell them the idea of what cryptocurrency means for the future.
Using it as an investment for a quick buck or investment in the technology should be made up by their own minds through research and what you said to get them started.
Never sell them the idea of using it to make money. It's too volatile and if you do this at the wrong time, you quite possibly could make someone lose everything and cause a lot of pain. To which, **you** will be blamed for it, ending w/e relationship you had with said person(s). 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:31:11
Coinbase controls your private keys. Not you, so they technically own your crypto.
It's why people say to never keep it on exchange sites. Exchanges have been hacked, accounts are easier to social engineer, etc.
Best to buy on exchange, transfer to your own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:46:27
I used a paper wallet via the offline method while I waited for my Nano S to arrive.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:27:31
Get your seed punched in metal like you said. You will be fine.
You can blow the Nano up with TNT and still have access to your wallet via the seed with not just a new Nano, but any BIP39 compliant wallet.
Also, split the two apart. Single point of failure is setting you up for a world of hurt. Either keep the Nano on you, seed in safe. Or Nano in safe, seed offsite somewhere secure.
In the meantime, just don't fall asleep with a lit cig ;) (Do split your seed and Nano up though, even now) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:21:34
Coinbase has an option to set up recurring buys in a daily, weekly, monthly format should you want to automate it. Though, it's a set amount each time (set by the first buy).
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:52:30
I suggested it because it's a form of cold storage, which is among the most secure ways of storing your crypto. 
If you plan on making transactions or moving the crypto a lot before your Ledger, then I can understand. But if you're looking for the best way to store until your hardware comes. Cold storage is best, as that's essentially what the Ledger is. Difference being the Ledger encrypts your key, vs printing it and throwing it in a safe.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:26
This would be the route I would go. Gift the Nano, and a paper wallet separately. 
Walk them through setting it up, then have them generate their own new seed to get familiar with the process. Same with wiping it to restore.
Then have them transfer the paper wallet over to the fresh seeded Ledger. 
Not only does this teach them about the device and some basics with wallet security. It won't come back to bite you if the funds disappear.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:13
Ah ok.
I agree. It would be better to have some already on an exchange. Though I did run into a problem where I wanted to invest in another alt that I originally had no plans on. Which meant I needed to pull some extra from cold storage earlier. Granted, I use ETH as my primary trade currency (faster for me). But I was caught in that pickle.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:52:49
Don't get locked into thinking BTC is invulnerable to manipulation.

You can purchase on Amazon. That's where I got mine. Arrived 4 days later.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:06:56
Fees are tagging along to BTC's moonshoot.
As more people hop on board, the more unconfirmed txs jam the highway (blockchain).
Imagine thousands of cars now have to merge down into one tiny lane, while there is an express lane with a toll. The more people that use the express, drives up the express toll.
So the toll being the tx fee, shoots for the moon along with BTC's market value.
You shouldn't have split it into two transactions. You paid 2x high fees vs once. Hence losing a hefty chunk.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:58:45
KeepKey has been having a lot of issues as of late. Reading reviews on Amazon and other outlets expands on this.
It looks great, but it's advised to go with Trezor or Ledger at this current time.

Bought mine off Amazon.
And if security is a concern about 3rd party, which is a legitimate concern to have. Read [this blog]( from Ledger real quick.
As a side note, to further assure you are not compromised. You can reset the Ledger and generate a new seed, as many times as you want. I did it twice myself for piece of mind.
You can do this by setting up the Ledger with a PIN, then enter it wrong 3 times. That wipes the device and it will then prompt you to generate a new seed, or import from backup. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:35:17


He already answered your question. Maybe he doesn't want to miss out on other investment opportunities? Earlier tonight was the best time to dump some money into alts. As BTC corrects from this dip, so will the alts.
Sounds to me like you're all or nothing with BTC. Nothing wrong with that, but some of us invest in more than just one currency. It's sad that fees are so high right now, pathetic honestly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:11:13
It's really only a loss if you cash out. Otherwise, I see it as a locked in venture that goes up and down, up and down, up and down, on **perceived** value.
Cashing out would trigger the actual loss.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:10:29
Splitting the two as separate wallets, means 2 separate seeds. More surface of attack for would be thieves. So store your seeds well and separately to minimize this.
It's not a bad thing either, if one is compromised, you still have your other. So you won't lose everything.
I've heard of people doing one as a HODL wallet, one that they wont touch other than adding funds to. Their other hardware wallet is used as a secure savings account that they add and withdraw from. While using a hot wallet as a checking account to spend or send funds to the savings wallet.
Managing a lot, but I like to think of it as 3 separate tiers of investment. One fails, you have the others, vs one wallet only and chances of losing everything are vastly increased. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:35:12
OP has their seed written down. They're fine.
Paper wallets are good, but they have the private key printed on them, visible to anyone who finds it.
OP's USB is encrypted. Anyone who finds it isn't getting anything unless they somehow brute it or know the pass to decrypt. If the USB fails, they can just restore their wallet on a new device using the seed.
Encrypted USB is more secure than a paper wallet to a degree.

It won't work if it's been messed with. The wallet app has a verification.
If you are worried someone took the seed. Reset it by setting a pin and entering wrong 3 times.
You can generate a fresh seed. I did this a few times with mine just to be safe.

I'd you can set that pile of cash on fire and be ok. Then yeah.
BTC is gaining traction, and things look great. But anything can happen. If you are gonna do it, don't panic if it drops a little. That's the nature of the market. It will bounce back.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:33:51
You can send them as a transfer, or sweep.
For the sake of security since it's a hardware wallet. Create a new seed and address, then transfer over your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:32:02
Unless you invest a chunk of $$$ in actual mining equipment and join a decent pool.
You're better off buying BTC outright.
If you really do want to mine, and don't want to sink about 10k in for mining equipment. You can mine Alts and then convert to BTC using a PC with better specs than the one you listed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:50:24
Hardware wallet would be my go to since this is new for you.  There are other really good secure options, but hardware is the easiest to step into right off the bat.
Hide your seed well too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:12:30
Web wallets have chances of seed leakage. Compromised PC's/Mac's with malware etc.
The Nano S, Trezor, and other hardware wallets store the private key on the device and is encrypted. They are also disconnected from the internet most of the time as cold storage. So more secure in that regard.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:42:05
The type of wallet you want, is determined by how you use crypto.
As well as how protected you want to be. I personally use a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet for storing most of my crypto. While using a mobile Android wallet like Coinomi for spending, trading, converting.

Honest question.
What's wrong with being able to clear debt and obtain financial freedom and security?
Until you actually cash out, no matter what you think you have going. It's all speculation. Some people are doing what they initially set out to do. Not everyone want's to HODL a dream of ever increasing profit.
While many are going into debt to chase their moon. Some are clearing theirs, and setting a clean slate for an even better investment. Which honestly, is a very smart thing to do. 
Take care of yourself first, don't leave yourself open for a world of hurt in case shit hits the fan. Remember, this is all a game of speculation.

[This is]( a great read about Dollar Cost Averaging. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:38:13
You have to wait for it to clear your bank. But on the plus side, the price you bought at is locked. 
So if BTC jumps to 11k for example before you receive them. The transaction is locked to the market value when you made the purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:43:47
I'd stay far away from KeepKey at the moment. They have had lots of issues regarding forks and other problems while never being updated.
Better off with a Trezor or Ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:18:36
Coinbase is an exchange yes.
Leaving it on an exchange leaves yourself open to losing your crypto. Things can happen (look up Mt Gox). That, and exchanges are like banks. They control your crypto as they control your private keys. 
There are pros though, if you only have small amounts, do lots of trading, or are buying constantly. Leaving it on an exchange can be ok. Risk factor is still there though.
If you're buying crypto as an investment (HODL). It's advised to transfer your crypto to a wallet where you control the keys.
Another thing to factor, is if you're dollar cost averaging your buy ins. It's suggested to wait until you have a decent amount before moving as the fees can chunk out your total. So if you're only buying $25 worth of BTC. Keep it on said exchange until you have $100 worth or more. Pay once rather than 4 times (4x25).
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:32

I bought a Ledger Nano S off Amazon. I'm not worried as they have info on how their "anti tampering" stance fits into the equation. It's already linked in here and also printed on a card that comes with the Ledger.
To be extra sure past the hardware verification when syncing with the Chrome Apps. I reset my seed twice by entering my pin wrong 3 times, each time allowing me to start a fresh wallet with a fresh seed before settling in and moving my crypto over.
I cannot speak for Trezor or KeepKey though. Just the Ledger Nano S.

@_date: 2017-11-28 05:28:29
Lets be real here though. Bitcoin has skyrocketed in popularity and is being touted as a get rich investment right now by those who are not familiar with everything.
In terms of the US, our society is trained to live beyond our means. More and more people go under a dump truck of credit debt. With the current price of BTC, lots of people I assume don't have that kind of disposable income, other than their credit.
I personally know 5 people who maxed their cards buying as much BTC as they can to try and cash in on the current rally.
I constantly see people post in crypto subs talking about how they took out huge credit loans and cards for this. There are a lot of people willingly putting themselves under for this.
While you and some others are actually smart about this. I'm pretty sure you can agree that a good large majority of the people jumping on now. Are not.

Great advice.
Personally, I didn't want to take any chances. I ordered a Ledger Nano S before investing in any crypto. My investment is tiny, but I plan to grow my portfolio and having my Ledger right from the get go, is an extra piece of mind.
Plus, I find the whole hardware aspect of it to be pretty cool haha.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:35:11
Pick the one that has the best deal. I bought my Nano S off Amazon a week before the 21% off from Ledger themselves. However I've been more than happy with it.
If security is your concern. [Read this blog]( that details why they don't have tamper proof seals.
To feel even more safe, you can create as many new seeds as you want with the Nano S before settling on a seed to use. You can do this by setting up the Nano's PIN, and then entering it wrong 3 times. You can then have it generate a new seed after it wipes itself. Repeat as many times as you want.
I did it twice personally, just for that extra mile.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:40:31
If crypto gets the mass adoption you speak of.
I'm more than positive there will be an industry for hardware and digital wallets. We have a ton of mobile wallets already for instance. But only a few hardware options.

Not easy for many, but the safest way in my opinion. Would be committing it to memory.
I personally haven't tried it, nor do I think I can keep my seed to memory in the correct order. But I know several who can and have, so it is possible.
My seed is locked away in a fire/flood proof box, inside a safe. So I'm covered from that (hopefully).

Dollar cost average is an option.

That plus no debt in general and a decent rainy day fund.
Honestly, I think doing this was the wise move. If I had the option, I would and I think others should too. Solidifying your financial freedom like this will provide the best security possible should things go south.
If you cash out at the right amount for your situation that allows this, you should have more than enough to buy back in and still make more profits.
I know lots of people want to ride to the moon, but until they actually cash out on their investments. It's pure speculation, all the while mortgages, loans, debt, savings all hang on the line.
TL;DR: What OP did was smart and he solidified a great financial life and security.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:05:18
A sweep is taking the private keys and the funds over to a new address with a new key. The old keys are now owned by the new one. It's advised to sweep wallets that have keys that are possibly compromised or never owned by you (like blockchain.info). That way, you still have control over them. It's like importing.
Why I saw to create a new seed however, is because it's the only for sure way to know you are secure. Specially with a hardware wallet, which is one of the most secure ways of storage. Online and mobile wallets have chances of seed leakage. The Nano S circumvents this.
A new seed means no ties to your previous wallet other than the blockchain transaction (which Ledger generates new receiving addresses for security within your Nano coin wallets btw).

Even if your investment is small. Your portfolio will grow in time. Best to keep all your crypto safe.

Stay away from KeepKey. They have been having way too problems.
Stick with Trezor or Ledger.

If you don't have the seed to get into your previous wallet. You're SOL

Let me consult my crystal ball.

Don't know if you have noticed. But Bitcoin is trending worldwide at the moment on all fronts of media and word of mouth.
IE; There are many many many many more people into it now and more by the day.
2013 was prospects. We are actually seeing this unfold in real time.  Sure, there will be corrections, dips. But I doubt it's going to mirror what happened before for as long.

If you care about your investment. I suggest a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet. Or generate a paper wallet offline.
Online, Computer, Mobile wallets all have seed leakage possibilities.

I almost sprung for one of those ASICS. Stood undecided long enough to watch the shitshow. Glad I didn't get caught up in it.

You would lose almost half of your $100 after all the fees going in and out. 
"Flipping" isn't really a thing. You're thinking of day trading. But I suggest doing a lot more research before you do anything. Let alone trading.

As much as I want to see it happen.
It's not.
It's easier to be divided than united because "My team is better". Something that has been ingrained into our society for ages.
It's politics, each side has their faults, neither will acknowledge them or back down. Best you can do is just stay out of it if the drama is too much.

Buy $200 now, then put another $200 in later and so forth.
You can average your way in over time.

Wallet is a blockchain address...
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:48:53
Yeah, just standard market fluctuation.

How so? He is debt free with a house paid in full, taxes paid, and still has enough to buy back in for good profits.
If you're actually investing. OP did an amazing fucking job.
