Devastating if this is not a troll, but leaving ~$800,000 in bitcoin at all, not to mention an exchange, given its fluctuations and if that's the majority of your net worth, is so obviously foolish. Especially if you have 3 kids and a 4th on the way. Really absurdly poor judgement.
Why would you not just leave it safe in a bank...
EDIT: OP just changed his post from "1230" to "0.211 BTC" and edited a bunch of others... Seems to have been a troll.

They took a risk, but it was a risk 99.9% of people aren't able to take. You can't just be smart enough to buy 11 million dollars worth of bitcoin. You have to have 11 million dollars (that you can afford to lose) to buy it with.

They needed the means to pursue their lawsuit against him to get that 60+ million dollar settlement. They simply wouldn't have gotten that settlement had they not had the means to support that lengthy lawsuit with good lawyers. No I'm not suggesting that only wealthy people can come up with killer tech ideas.
You say "I don't think their background gave them any advantage over others except getting some help financially from their wealthy father." That's not "some help," that's literally a pre-requisite for getting a new business off the ground or for being able to take an $11m stab at a new technology (or, by extension, being able to defend your IP against a wealthy person in a lengthy lawsuit and get a $60m settlement.)
These guys have made some excellent decisions and I'm not holding their privileged position against them. They deserve credit for that. I'm saying that the person you responded to was right: it is infinitely easier for them to have the opportunities to make those excellent decisions due to their money and the people they've spent time around.
Why didn't many of us invest in bitcoin earlier? We simply hadn't heard of it. Why did some people here who invested early only invest a grand or two instead of a million or more? They simply didn't have the cash on hand.
Their advantage doesn't make them make the right decision. It gives them the opportunity to make the right decision, and to do it big. Most of us aren't even playing the game. We don't have access to the ideas or the capital.
Is it impossible to make something big starting from zero? No. You need to have the ideas, ambition, drive, tenacity, and luck to do it, and it may take your whole life. And only then can you make plays like they have. Am I trying to arguing against every person's responsibility to work for themselves and take command of their own life? No. I'm just saying that these two were born one step from the goal line; all they had to do was make the right calls in order to cross it. And as I said before, most of us, if we're playing our cards right, are a lifetime of work away from being at the step that they were born on.
I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing per se, it's just a reality of our world.

It had a price on exchanges. The title says the first "real world" transaction, i.e. the first transaction for goods or services.
But that isn't even true. It's very old and it was mentioned on a forum, but that doesn't mean it was the first one. It's the first *well recorded and well known* one.

Eh, he was clearly asking for technical reasons. Like, you're right, he doesn't just want opinions. I think he made that clear to begin with.
I'd say the substantive parts of your answer were: 1) Good developers, and 2) Lightning network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:17:13
Perhaps they wouldn't. But I think you'd be hard pressed to find an exchange as influential as coinbase, where a currency just being added would make its price skyrocket, that would be able to stop their employees from either 1) doing this themselves or 2) telling anyone in their lives that a currency addition was coming.
Stopping their employees is the far easier one. Stopping anyone from telling anyone about it I'd say is just not possible.

Well yes, it would matter. If you invested 10% of your net worth at the start of the year, your btc holdings would currently be well over 90% of your net worth. (Assuming your NW is otherwise unchanged.)

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:12
I agree entirely. Do we expect people involved with btc to be "on their best behavior" for...ever? Just so bitcoin gets more adoption? And then what...? Then it's a free for all after some arbitrary time?
This is what happens when there's no government rules against insider trading. It is never going to be any other way. Bitcoin being a revolutionary idea and technology does not change real power dynamics or the desire for wealth.
This is what unregulated looks like, for better and for worse. People with power use it for personal gain even with strong regulations; they will certainly do so with none.

Ok, maybe you would like to believe that, but you already said explicitly that you don't. I've never heard of nor been to it, there's nowhere I've "come here from," etc., I just thought the bad rap this subreddit got for being a circlejerk was a little undeserved and an exaggeration, but I see now that that's actually not true.
If you're uncomfortable with the fact that you don't really know what you're talking about and just came here to get excited with other people, I'm sorry, but that's something personal you need to work out with yourself.

I know this sentiment is looked upon positively, but it absolutely makes me sick. (Please don't take this personally; I'm not mad at you.)
IMO, white guilt is racism. White people are not responsible for the things white people did or do, just like black people aren't responsible for what other black people do. By lumping people up (and doing it to yourself, no less!) by race, you're just being racist. And you're giving approval to racism.
People are individuals. Generalizations like this are breeding grounds for racism. It's a lazy and ultimately destructive mental shortcut regardless of what race or what judgement (positive or negative) you're talking about. There is no "white" team. There is no "black" team, nor is there an "Asian" team. There are no teams. The point is that we're all on the same team.
If white people can be held accountable for what other white people do and have done, then so can other races, and racism is allowed. You can't have it both ways. You can't have one without the other.

I just, I guess naively, assumed you might have had real reasons for your absolute bullishness. Now you're saying you never did, and that you only felt like getting excited with others who agree with you (otherwise known as circlejerking). I just didn't realize that.
I saw you defend yourself against other comments, so I thought there was some idea you were defending, but I see now, like you told me, there's nothing down there but blind positivity. So I apologize for expecting any rationality here.
I see bitcoin as something that can change the world, but that doesn't affect my confidence in it. I hope you can understand that. Like I said, and as I'm sure you know, the best ideas do not always win out. There are real, irrational (and not always pro-bitcoin irrational like yourself) people that it has to go through first, and what makes that happen is anyone's guess.

Right, but you have no idea why, other than that it's a new technology and it has potential benefits. The primary force behind the strength of your opinion is apparently that you desperately want this to be your opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something huge.

1) Predatory lending is not inherent to credit cards. It should be illegal. Credit cards need not be abolished; just extend already existing predatory lending laws to credit cards.
2) Predatory lending is not offering more money to people the poorer they are. Not sure if you have a credit card, but no one does that. They give you a larger line of credit the more money + income you have. Predatory lending revolves around the exorbitant rates you mentioned.

It's all well and good that you've unilaterally decided that bitcoin will 100% guaranteed succeed, but don't expect everyone else to follow your reasoning (or lack thereof).
You're just going buckwild with your wishful thinking. Bitcoin doesn't exist in your head. Bitcoin exists in reality. It needs regular people to adopt it. You have to stop ignoring the fact that in real life, the best idea doesn't always win out. There's a chance that this won't work.

Individuals are not responsible for paying shares of the national debt. By helping the country thrive, they can contribute to the debt being paid, but no individual is personally responsible for paying off any part of the debt.
To say that "a child born in the USA this moment is responsible for paying a share of the $18,141,444,135,563.30 national debt" is to try to mislead the reader by contrasting two things (a small child and an enormous national debt) that are never in reality on the same playing field.

Yes, the chart is stupid because inflation isn't inherently bad, but what were you thinking when you wrote, "it signals decreasing inflation, or deflation..."???

Well yeah, heterosexuality is usually based on feelings...? Don't think there are many people whose sexuality is based on facts... ????
I think in this guy's skewed perspective heterosexuality is strictly superior and correct compared to inferior and incorrect homosexuality. Seems wrong; sure it makes sense to be straight, but it's not "illogical" to be gay. There are enough people on Earth; people, straight and gay, don't have a goal to populate the planet, at least in the West. Attractions are not a choice, the implication that people choose to have straight or gay feelings is wrong, and the implication that straight people choose to be that way based on logic is also incorrect.

Um yeah, anyone should have bought $10 bitcoin instead of going to any given movie in 2011... they'd have $1000 right now! I don't think anyone who went to a movie in 2011 would tell you today that they'd rather have gone to that movie instead of having $1000 today.
Is this real life? In my opinion, any reasonable person who spent 35 2011-bitcoins on molly would say today that they'd rather have simply purchased their molly from a different source and be $149k richer today than have bought it on silk road and have none of those coins today. What's so special about Silk Road molly?
Should they not have bought the coins? No. Could they possibly have known what bitcoin would be today? Of course not. Do I fault them for spending it? No!
But to say with the benefit of hindsight, that, for a given person, having $149,000 more today would not have been worth simply buying molly from a different source is completely and utterly unreasonable.

It's okay to recognize patterns in life that may help us make different choices later, which may lead to better outcomes. Don't obsess! And yes, I would take $149,000 in exchange for having bought molly from a difference source every day of the week! If you'd rather have spent $10 on a movie ticket in 2011 than have $1000 today, more power to you, but I'll take the grand every time. There's no need to obsess on the past, but I think it's equally unhealthy to ignore it.

But he buys it in dollars. Not bitcoin. That's better 'cause the bitcoin went up in value. See?
I wasn't going to second guess his decision to buy molly in the first place, but now that you mention it, it's almost certain that he would be better off putting almost all of his molly money into bitcoin and holding it. He'd have made a 100x return on that money! Can't argue with that.

The winning strategy in investing is: buy low, sell high.
Right now, you're suggesting to sell BTC (which is low) and buy BCH (which is at an all time high.)
His implication is that BTC will bounce back from this, while BCH will fall somewhat from this all time high (ATH).

This seems like the end of complete transparency on the blockchain, which is fundamental to bitcoin. Am I wrong? How are those transactions verified before re-syncing with the blockchain?
It just seems like a massive chink in the armor of bitcoin's security and simplicity.

A lot of the sense of freedom and peace you have is from having much wealth. Wealth is what confers you the benefits of not having to work, having a sense of peace, and having the freedom to attend to the subjects you choose.
Wealth in dollars confers those benefits just as well. In fact, you are only wealthy because of your dollar-value wealth. You still cannot live a wealthy person's lifestyle with bitcoin. If the dollar value of bitcoin plummeted, you would not longer be wealthy... thus you are only wealthy in dollars.
The peace, contentment, and stability that come with financial wealth are amazing. Just don't tell yourself that it's something special about bitcoin that's providing you those things; it's your wealth, regardless of currency, that's doing that. And even in this case, it's your dollar wealth that's providing those things.

Wow, alright! What a rollercoaster!
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:15:54
I don't see it reaching 4k unless there's a big drop... to far below 4k.
Maybe wait for the recoil on this jump to 6400 and get in, maybe at 6000 hopefully. If you wait for 5-5.5k you might never see it at this point. It only barely hit 5.5k on this most recent dip.
If you're not in at all any more, I'd just bite the bullet and get in if you see 6200 or so. You don't want to be left in the dust anymore. Just get in there... we all know this isn't the top.
Reminds me of a good quote: "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."

Bitcoin has nothing to do with Anne Frank, and frankly (don't fucking say anything) this article barely has anything to do with her either. She's mentioned once outside the opening paragraph, and only as an example of someone persecuted by the Nazis. There's no indication that she has any more to do with this issue than anyone else living in Germany at the time.
This is shitty writing, shitty clickbaiting, and is yet another article written for people who already agree with the author. It contributes to its own echo chamber and nothing more.

I mean of course. It all depends if you think the current trend will continue or reverse. No one knows the answer. That's why one of the top comments simply says "Go for it, if you want." There is no answer to your question. You must answer it for yourself.

I had a similar experience, but I don't think that was the bottom.
Like you, I'm looking at Jan 2014 as a model and expecting a slow bleed. Back then it didn't find the bottom for 1-2 years, during which it dropped to around 1/5th of its max price of ~1200. That would be like btc being 1k in mid-2019.
So I don't think you've missed the boat. It will be lower soon enough and you'll have an even better time to buy.

Seriously. Usually this sub is smart and gives this advice more readily. To put your life savings into BTC is about as foolish as it gets, and, if anyone relies on you, wildly irresponsible.
I think it's going to the moon as much as anybody, but for god's sake look at reality... it's extremely volatile, and if it goes down 80% like it did after the 2013 boom and you need some money, you're absolutely fucked.

If you have USD on your coinbase account, you can transfer them to gdax immediately and for free. This is because coinbase owns gdax.
But if the money is already on there, any BTC you buy is already instantly available anyway.

This seems to confirm that at the time of the fork, as in the immediate aftermath, they will refer to the current chain as Bitcoin and the new one as Bitcoin 2X, as stated in their message earlier today.
This says that, going forward (as in, after some time has passed and the Coinbase team decides a level of stability has been reached), they will call the more difficult chain Bitcoin.
They don't want to be involved in deciding what will be the dominant chain. They want to let the market decide. And when it has decided, they will call that one Bitcion.

Question: Why would miners continue to mine for fewer and fewer btc?
Continued mining seems highly dependent on the value of btc increasing. If it doesn't go up enough to incentivize mining, seems like btc will simply collapse, no?

Yes, this is the case. We can't access them. That's why there was an uproar at the split when Coinbase had no plans to support it, and why they responded within days to say that they'd roll out withdrawal support on January 1.

Well that's easy; people were wrong to hold after it hit $1100 in 2013, and they were wrong to hold in May when it hit $3k.

IMO if you have anything over several grand, saving it in bitcoins is mad. There's too much fluctuation. Doesn't make sense to have your *savings* in something that regularly fluctuates 200-300% from month to month. If you ever need that money, who know? It might just not be there this month.

Sounds very implausible that she created a market for small goods. She was in hiding from the ages of 13-15 before being deported to the concentration camps. Her involvement with a market is not mentioned at all in her wiki.
Who are you quoting in your comment?
This was a particularly bright 13-15 year old girl who kept a diary during her hiding... that is what she is famous for. I have no idea how someone could come to the conclusion that she was responsible for the creation of an entire underground market in the city of Amsterdam.

...whoa. Are you serious? I'm not working for anybody, man. Don't go off the deep end on me. 
I'm just recognizing all is not great in the world of bitcoin, but all I see on is bullishness and positivity. It's lost almost half its value in the past 2 days, but judging by the posts on here you'd think everything was fine and dandy. I mean, the current precipitous decline in price (is that better than "crash"?) it certainly not a *good* thing for bitcoin or anyone invested in it, wouldn't you agree?
And, by the way, "crash" is a perfectly accurate, non-overreactionary word to describe what's going on with the price. It's completely appropriate and accurate, and if you're saying it isn't, I think you're being defensive and unreasonable. The price absolutely plummeted. It fell by half in like a day, maybe a day and a half. That's a crash for sure.

Yeah, not really. The mentality of people on I don't think really contributes at all to the welfare of bitcoin. Anyways, it's not that people on always say "bubbles are good!", it's that they put positive spin on any bitcoin news. It's as if nothing bad happens to it. Everything is good news.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:27:36
The people who care about it are the people who invested late in the game and have now lost their gains or have lost money on the whole. And there are almost definitely more of those people than there are people who invested before its sudden rise.
What exactly is your point with this post? Are you just bragging that you don't give a shit? Well good for you, but people aren't freaking out that bitcoin is dying, they're freaking out about *losing their money*. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:14:52
Wow. Thank you. I stand corrected. That guy was a total asshole who seems to actually have been taking the success of bitcoin as a personal affront and using his position to reinflate his ego by saying "I told you so" to the bitcoin supporters he's been reading about. What a dick.
I now get why people on here have started reacting by taking it personally themselves. It's because dickheads like that *make* it personal.
Honestly, what annoyed me the most was this:


I agree that the comparison to gold is meaningless, but not because bitcoin is fiat and gold is physical. If it were because of that, then comparing dollars to gold would be absurd as well, but it isn't.
Anyways, I see now. Thanks.

Yes, it is their gamble to take. It's a gamble that many took, and that many now think has not/will not pay off. I'm fairly certain that's what all the fuss is about.
I don't know where you're looking, but I haven't seen a rash of people come out say say, "Haha, I *knew* bitcoin was going to fail!" It seems to me like you're inventing an enemy and arguing against it.
