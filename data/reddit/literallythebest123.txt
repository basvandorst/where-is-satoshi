This is great. I do believe that the internet DOES deserve a native currency. This is such a step in the right direction. Bitcoin is the future!
@_date: 2018-05-29 04:24:17
I guess that means that after 14 days, they're going to take all your money
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:36:42
I think that you should just generally be able to read the person you're about to deal with. Things like the way he/she chats is a key factor. On Paxful (the platform I use), there's also a reputation system so I judge a lot depending on that. I guess there are different ways to read a user's shady-ness depending on the platform you use.
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:33:02
I would choose Paxful for their various methods of payment and their 24/7 customer service. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:21:55
Add this to the list of the things Paxful has done for Africa. *applauds*
@_date: 2018-05-31 06:53:33
Good article! This could prove to be really good for newbies like me lol
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:08:11
Aw man when will people see the beauty that is bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:34:54
Agreed. Paxful is really good not only for the services, but I really believe in them because they give back to people that gave them success.
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:02:43
Maybe you should try a P2P exchange like Paxful! I have also tried several exchanges before eventually settling in on Paxful. Haven't had anything bad to say about it yet. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:39:18
I think he/she means to actually go look for some. I think it's going against his point if he/she gives you a source. If you want a starting point, I started on Coindesk and did my own research from there.
@_date: 2018-05-31 06:43:20
I do most of my transactions through Paxful, a p2p platform. You should check it out if you're looking for multiple deals with many different payment methods.
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:45:34
I totally agree with the customer service part. I don't know how many times I've been able to save my money thanks to the help of the great customer service team.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:16:17
Paxful, I think, is the next best option here. All that's required is e-mail verification.
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:59:29
Just trust in Paxful, don't worry about it. It's nothing customer service can't fix.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:04:51
Great article! I've also read a lot about what Paxful's doing for Africa. It's amazing to see someone looking out for the less fortunate.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:04:37
Hmm that's interesting. I wonder what kind of "improvements" they're going to make on Coinbase Pro that'll supposedly make it better than the Coinbase we have today (which for me, personally, is setting a really low bar for Coinbase pro).
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:56:48
the best P2P in the game!!!
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:02:30
Does this only apply to the newcoiners? I think this kind of applies to everyone lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:42:31
I've read a lot of things going on over there in South Africa and Nigeria (such as the schools and blockchain incubator hub being built by Paxful). Bitcoin really seems to be gaining a lot of traction there and I think it's because it gives a lot of the unbanked an opportunity to be more financially stable. It's quite exciting to see what bitcoin can really do.
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:21:45
This is still very crazy to me tbh. The fact that someone bought 2 pizza for 10,000 btc is unbelievable and it shows you how many people believed in it back then, and the stunning change that happened throughout the years to make bitcoin what it is today.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:42:21
I believe Paxful is next best thing. They've got great 24/7 customer support and they're the biggest p2p market now imo. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:02:58
True, my bad. But still, it's great to see that Bitcoin is being used as protection against the corrupt. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 04:26:37
Give Paxful a shot. All that needs to be verified on there is your e-mail. There are also 300+ payment methods and their customer support is great.
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:05:33
A lot of people will never understand that this may as well have been the original intent for Bitcoin: giving its holders their own individual power over their money, 
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:13:47
Yes, Bitcoin is growing and it's extremely exciting
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:09:34
Never thought about it that way before. Great points and let's start the revolution!
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:33:08
I don't think so, but I hope so.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:41:31
I'm not afraid of it being "dragged through the mud" because there will always be a community fighting for crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:06:03
Give it a shot! Been on it for a while and it's been smooth sailing so far.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:44:22
I guess there's a reason that the domain name is bullshitnews.org lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:44:24
I'm actually not quite sure. Doesn't it depend on the exchange/platform as well?
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:43:11
Great article. Perfect for people getting just getting into it.
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:27:08
I think in this case, paxful.com is a good option for you. All they need is phone and e-mail verification AFAIK. They also have a ton of payment methods (including PayPal and gift cards).
@_date: 2018-06-04 04:31:42
Bitcoin is the future and I can't wait for the rest of the world to realize that!
@_date: 2018-06-04 04:31:07
This is awesome! It's really nice to see that more and more everyday, there are small signs of Bitcoin (or any other crypto for that matter) increasing its acceptability among people.
@_date: 2019-02-22 10:33:37
Noob question: Is bitcoin shared without a pre-nup?
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:43:48
If you actually read the article you'd see it's not just that.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:08:12
I suggest Paxful as well. I was on LBC before but I switched over to Paxful after LBC implemented KYC. There are so many methods of payment and the customer service of Paxful is great.
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:47:20
*My allegiance is to the republic Anakin, to Democracy!*
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:15:35
The animation is sickk
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:51:17
No matter how big Coinbase gets, I'm never going back there lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:15:02
Lol yea. Fuck em. Maybe it's time for a switch?
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:38:53
You can always try switching to a peer-to-peer transaction ran platform, I don't the government can touch it if it's P2P. I recommend checking out Paxful. I've been on it and I can't complain about anything over there.
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:10:02
It's happening...
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:34:36
Couldn't agree more. The service of Paxful is great and yeah, they don't do KYC lol
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:54:12
What a great article! Paxful is doing amazing things over there in Africa!
