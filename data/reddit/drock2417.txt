If you cash that out do you get US dollars or umpahloomoah bucks?

Hahaha! No kidding. And my question is what did you buy those bitcoins with? That’s right, US Dollars.....

I’ve never understood the hatred for “banks”. They provide a safe, secure, and insured location for my money.  They pay me interest on my money.  They offer me loans and help me buy things.  Never in my life had a bank “stolen my money, “ “put a gun to my head and made me take a subprime loan on something that was hundreds of thousands over what I could afford” “never been treated rudely. In fact most bank people are so pleasant it makes me laugh.”  So what is it? I’m not a bank expert but I’ve never had a single bank issue in the 40 years I’ve used them.  I know a lot of banks around 2007/2008 should have never let people sign on the dotted line for a third home mortgage when the worked at McDonald’s but common sense in the borrower really is at fault there.

Then what is the point of bitcoins? I thought it was the supreme currency that everyone would buy things with?  I truly don’t get it.  I think it’s great some people had something worth nothing and made a quick fortune. Same way I love to see a person in a casino win on green or a hard ways bet. But that is all it is. Massive gambling. But if bitcoins aren’t for making purchase what the hell are they for??!

Are you seriously suggesting someone gamble their home on currency speculation ? And I use currency lightly here.
