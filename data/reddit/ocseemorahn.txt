I got a bunch of those types of emails not long after the partial database leak 7 months ago.  Pretty much everyone's email and login name was leaked but not the passwords (the passwords were hashed).  So all the scammers basically just emailed everyone on the list looking for their passwords.
Might want to check this database of the leak to see if your username and email were on it.  Then maybe change the email associted with the account so you don't get the fishing emails anymore.

I've used Bitcoinspinner.  It works fine.
The app is dead simple, and you can use QR codes to just take a picture and send coins to a merchants wallet or your friends wallet.
Bitcoin spinner is an example of a lite client.  A client where you store the private keys for the wallet on your own device, but the blockchain itself is hosted remotely.  This avoids the data intensive blockchain downloads that would choke most phones.

I've always gotten the dwolla transfers within 24 hours of withdrawing from Mt gox, you may have just gotten unlucky with a transfer on high volume days where they run their dwolla account temporarily dry.
Usually it's the bank transfer step that is the slowest.
Alternatively if you can find a ring you like on amazon you can buy it within an hour using btcbuy.info.  Then the shipping would have it at your door within two days.

Too big now to feasibly operate?
it's about a gigabyte at the moment.  Slightly larger than a CD.  I have thousands of CDs on my computer plus about 500 movies that are much larger than CD's.  I have a lot of space left over.
Even if I were running the whole thing on my 3 year old phone I'd have lots of space left over.
And all that is assuming you're a curmudgeon like me and refuse to run a thin client.

I think it's a great idea.  You could emphasize that it's a currency that can't be inflated, and that switching to this would end the fed and the bank's control over their lives very quickly.  It will be the new internet equivalent of holding non-inflationary gold that can never be stolen by a government without your consent.  Big issues to Ron Paulers.
One idea is to be your own bitcoin faucet.  Load about 2 bitcoins onto Bitcoinspinner and offer to give anyone who loads Bitcoinspinner onto their phone 1 bitcent to play with.  They could send some to a friend or send it right back to you.  Won't cost you but 10 dollars (less than the printing costs for flyers) and it will give them something tangible instantly.
Second idea have maybe a little diagram available about how to buy more coins (ie Dwolla --&gt;Mt Gox--&gt;Bitcoin), with a flyer linking some of the services you can buy with bitcoin.
I think the bitinstant guys had a nice flyer for CES...though it was heavily weighted towards their business of course.  You may want to steal and modify it a little.  Maybe even interface with them on the boards a little to see if they have any materials you can use.
Good luck and have fun :)  Any time I've ever gone out to political events for any type of advocacy it's always been a positive experience (never done it for bitcoin though).  Meet new people, get out and do something interesting.

Escrow is already a simple and long accepted method to take care of the problem that you are addressing in an overly complicated manner.
That being said maybe your idea has more merit than I can see, you can suggest the idea over on the bitcoin message boards and maybe the mods will pick it up, or you could program it yourself and commit it to the client, thus allowing the developers to vote on whether it sucks or not and accepting or discarding it.  Don't expect much result out of suggesting MORE work for someone else unless you're willing to step up yourself.
[Best place to put a suggestion is in the Development &amp; Technical Discussion section of the boards](
As well, my understanding is that bitcoin already has escrow built into the protocol but it's not implemented yet, so currently you have to go through a company.  BTCrow and Thrucoin are the currently operating escrow services.

Clearly someone IS trading at volumes of 0.0001 over, and over, and over again.  Mt Gox's rules are not being enforced or are just for show there.
What I hate about their api is exactly what I stated above.  When large buys or sells happen the api totally shuts down and you can't see what is happening.  It's like a car windshield that goes black whenever you slam the brakes, or take a really sharp turn.
It's pretty obvious that the API is basically choking whenever there is moderate volumes of trades.  God forbid bitcoin and Mt Gox should ever attain even a small amount of notoriety.  At the moment it barely works during low 20,000 volume days with choking anytime there are a few hundred trades in a couple minutes.  And on 200,000 volume days it is basically worthless.

This looks like the old database leak from 7 months ago.  It has the old account I used then but not the new one.  Also it looks like these accounts and email addresses all have the salted hash next to them.
This database is why all those old accounts got lots of bitcoin phishing emails but few actual hacks.

Well you could just print out a list of payment addresses to a text file or even a sheet of paper, and label it savings.  Maximum number of addresses will be about 100 in my recollection.
Then just hand out those payment addresses to whomever you want to pay you.  Just make sure you don't lose that original wallet.dat file.
Personally I just encrypted a small volume using truecrypt and copied the wallet.dat file into it, then I just emailed the truecrypt volume to like 5 places and stored it on every bit of storage media I have.  I'll always be able to get a copy of that wallet file somewhere if necessary, and unless 512 bit twofish nested in AES encryption is broken by some hyper advanced future civilization I am the only one that will ever be able to open and load that wallet file.

When your mom can use it.
Seriously.  Think about your mother, she's been buying things on Amazon and maybe iTunes for about a year or two now, she's only been on the internet for maybe 7 or 8?  The mom demographic is probably the most important demographic for all of technology (Yeah I said it, deal with it neckbeards.  No one who matters cares what the geeks think about it.) When it starts being simple enough that your mom can use it it's basically there.
That example was something I saw on the Bitcoin Forums.  I thought it was a bit flippant, and a little rude when I first read it; but if you think about it a bit it actually is a great yardstick for technology tipping points.
I've explained Bitcoin to my mom a few times. I even bought her Christmas presents with it last year.  She vaguely gets it but isn't even close to starting to use it.

First thing?  Make a [Dwolla]( account (it's like Paypal but less likely to steal your money and cheaper).  Link it to your bank account.  Dwolla will make a couple transfers of a few cents and ask you to confirm how much it was.  Once that is done put some money in your Dwolla account.  However much money you want to use to buy bitcoins.  Now make a [Mt. Gox]( account and transfer some money to it from the Dwolla account you funded.  Then buy some bitcoins on the market there.  You can transfer these purchased butcoins to your home wallet or leave it in Mt Gox.
For a home wallet you might want to use a thin client, since the full client takes like a day to download the blockchain.  Good thin clients that are around these days are Bitcoin Spinner for your android phone.  Once you have that mastered upgrade to the full Bitcoin client on your home computer.  My understanding is that the new version 0.6 has a bunch of really nifty new features like full wallet encryption, built in escrow services, and two signature wallet keys.
If you're still waiting around for Dwolla and Mt. Gox to connect and really want to play with a few bitcoins head to the [Bitcoin Faucet]( where you can get 0.005 BTC to play with.
Buying and selling?  I used BTCbuy to buy all my Christmas presents this year through Amazon. BTCbuy basically lets you buy Amazon and Newegg gift cards using bitcoins and frankly those are like the alpha and omega of shopping for me.  You can try buying some stuff from some actual bitcoin businesses found on this [list](  And if you're feeling frisky you can hit the Silk Road to buy a few narcotics for safe home delivery, though that is a whole extra level of heavy encryptions and account creations.

The term for that is called arbitrage.  The term isn't bitcoin specific it applies to any round robin type transaction where you take advantage of slight discrepencies in trading prices on different exchanges to make a profit.
Some folks do it with bitcoins, I know there used to be some pretty good bitcoin arbitrage opportunities by trading from gox to tradehill and back again, forget how specifically, but some folks claimed to have made some consistent money doing it.

4 gigabytes per day?  Heavens to betsy that's almost 1.5 Terabytes per year.  So that would mean me all by myself with just the stuff I have collecting dust in my closet can store 3 more years of the block chain on a crappy little server built from spare parts.  And that is assuming that hardrives get no more expensive and no large players get into the game to take advantage of transaction fees.
Using your example, if 5 billion people were making 10 transactions per day (I can't imagine making that many transactions per day myself 4-5 per week might be more reasonable but we'll use your number) that would mean that more than 70% of the world was using bitcoin as their main currency.  Currently world wealth is about 60 trillion dollars.  If 60 trillion dollars is divided by 21 million bitcoins and multiplied by .70 we will get the value of a bitcoin in your world.
$2million 2012 dollars per bitcoin.
If bitcoins are worth $2 million 2012 dollars apiece I guarantee there will be a large number of competing financial firms mining and jockeying for transaction fees.  Even using 2006 quality hard drives companies like google had servers with 2 terabytes apiece and they were running 450,000 of them.

All right.  I like a lot of this.  But I really, dislike the mining bit.  Just like I dislike the mining bit in so many summaries of the bitcoin economy.
In theory mining is never about obtianing the 50 coins from solving a block.
The point to mining is keeping a ledger of the transactions between people in the last ten minutes.  A reward for keeping this ledger is being entered into a lottery where you might win 50 bitcoins.
Now one of the main things that happen when you mine is that you try to solve a cryptographic problem that solidifies the last 10 minutes of transactions.  If you randomly happen upon the solution of this problem you generate a horrendously complex solution to a cryptography problem that solidifies the last ten minutes of transactions. It is an iteration of public/private key cryptography where you found the easy part of the solution and even if every computer in the world combined they would take years to break your solution.   Your reward for this work is 50 bitcoins.  Wahoo.  Good for you. The important part for the network is that you and 50 billion other people competed to find a very complex solution to a mind-bogling complex problem...and no one will be able to duplicate that.
tldr; I'm drunk and mining is a lottery based reward for being an accountant...you don't actually mine anything.
@_date: 2012-01-24 17:59:10
Mining is not how you as a consumer get bitcoins.  Just like mining for gold is not how you as a consumer get gold coins.  Just like printing isn't how you as a consumer get dollar bills.
Mining is simply a lottery based mechanism for rewarding the people who run the larger computers that maintain the ledgers and cryptography that keep track of the transactions.
The way you acquire bitcoins is by buying them, or providing a service in return for it.  In this it is the same as dollar bills, euros, or gold coins.
You might also try a bit of panhandling over at the bitcoin faucet.

Personally I think this is done because the Mt Gox API's are so shitty.  During high volatility both Mt Gox Live and clarkmoody (which uses the mt gox ticker api) just plain shut down.  Small trades would let you keep track of the current buy and sell prices at least.
This isn't really losing any money at all.  Just watching it I see he trades about once every 6 seconds up, and six seconds later down.  And the spread is about 3-5 bitcents.  So assume one loss every 12 seconds times the amount traded times the average spread and multiply it by about 10 hours. (usually when I see this behaviour it is during high volatility and runs for ten hours or so)
# of losses per minute = 5 (ie 60/12)
# of minutes per hour = 60
Amount of trade = .0001
The spread of the trade or loss = .04
# of hours = 
5 * 60 * 10 * 0.0001 * .04 = .012 US dollars

I've seen similar bots for the past year or more.  Both on the bid and sell side.  Frankly I'll often see bots that bounce .01 to .01 from bid to sell.
Personally I think this is done just to get useful data out of the system during chaotic market periods.  At these times both mt gox and clarkmoody go off the rails and lose track of current prices.  Hell even during mediocre trading both of those sites often lose track of the current price.  Also I can definitely say that when I execute small trades myself both sites fail to display about half to 2/3 of my trades.
If I had real money in this game I would consider making a bot like that just so I could track the price accurately.  Nothing nefarious in my opinion, just filling in the gaps in the system.

The way I would do it is by having Joe and Jake each create a Dwolla account and a Mt Gox account about 5 days before they want to be able to do the transfers.  This is a one time delay though and once these accounts are generated this week delay won't happen again.  Dwolla account must be linked Joe and Jake's respective bank accounts just like a Paypal account would be, they send you a couple deposits of a few cents and ask you to verify them.
In my experience the transfer timescale would then proceed like this:
Joe transfers $4000 to his Dwolla (~24-36 hours).  Joe transfers money to Mt Gox account from Dwolla (~ 1 hour).  Joe buys around 750BTC and removes 400 BTC one day and 350 BTC the next day(~30 hours).  Joe sends the 750 BTC to Jake's MT Gox account using the address Jake gets for funding (~1hour), and Jake then uses the 750BTC to buy around $4000 of USD.  Jake then starts to withdraw this $4000 from Mt Gox to Dwolla at the maximum rate of $1000 per 24 hour period (~80 hours total) .  He then uses Dwolla account to transfer $4000 to himself (~24-36 hours)
Grand total around 170-194 hours (7-8 days)
The "transfer fee" here would be around $48.50 (+/- any market wiggle that happened while transferring).  This transfer fee would come from the Mt Gox trade fee for two $4000 purchases and the $0.25 Dwolla fees for two transfers.
As far as large sums of money?  Well, you'll find good buyers for bitcoins for prices of up to about $40-80 grand at the moment.  Anything higher will be throwing the market all over the place, in a good way for your friend most likely though since you'll basically be creating a small bear trap and you'll end up with more money than you started (You'll buy enough to force the price higher and then when your friend sells the coins you transferred him 3 hours later he'll sell at that higher price).  If you go up to something more like $400 grand you'll knock the top AND bottom out of the market just transferring your money.

You are right, but from what I remember it's not really a problem.  There will be two major changes by the time the blockchain approaches a terrabyte in size.
1.  Lightweight clients (I use one on my phone in fact)  where the private keys are stored on your phone but the client syncs to a server hosted blockchain for the app.
2.  Harddrives will be bigger by then.  Mass adoption will take a long time and harddrives seem to double in size every year.
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:34:23

@_date: 2011-11-26 16:36:29
1. Mining is impossible with a lightweight client.
2. Lightweight clients decrease the amount of distributed copies of the peer to peer network, overall decreasing the networks efficiency.
That being said, an advantage is that lightweight clients are more useable in low bandwidth devices and for new users which is good for the bitcoin network because it increases use.
@_date: 2011-11-28 14:42:28
I like that wallet recovery idea.  Instead of a 128 bit key of seemingly random letters and numbers, you can simply memorize a 12 word arrangement that can later be used to regenerate that wallet if you so desire. (Wonder if the same thing could be done for bitcoin addresses?)
The appealing application for a lightweight app though is on smartphones.  No smartphone option here.
@_date: 2011-11-26 15:34:12
Generally it is almost impossible to buy bitcoins using Visas, other credit cards, Google Checkout, or Paypal.  The reason is that these methods all allow chargebacks after the fact.  So you could buy the irreversibly transferred bitcoins and then reverse the charge.  This has made a number of bitcoin vendors quite poor.
The easiest method for buying coins these days is via Dwolla (up and coming Paypal replacement company) and Mt. Gox.  Make a Dwolla account, connect and confirm your bank account same as Paypal.  Then transfer some US Dollars to your Mt Gox account and purchase some bitcoins in the big market there.
After that you can withdraw them from Mt Gox to your own wallet.
Also, if you just want a few millibitcoins to play with; try the bitcoin faucet.  
Gavin Andressen runs it as a way to get people playing with the currency.

As to your first point:
Yes you can make a copy, but you yourself are on one side of the ocean or the other, and therefore spending on the chain on that side of the ocean.  Unless you are making wallet.dat copies and randomly distributing them to people on both sides of the ocean there won't be any double spending.
Your other two points may be valid.

@_date: 2011-11-26 17:26:46
My recollection is that this contract can serve as a trusted third party itself or marginally involves a trusted third party.  Basically it's a fancy escrow and holds the coins so neither person can use them until the conditions are met.  The only way you could use this mechanism is if both parties were willing to wait several months for the Visa transaction to become irreversible and then they both decide to release the coins.
@_date: 2011-06-21 11:37:53
Yes, but interest usually goes mostly to the bankers, as a reward for creating money from nothing.
In a bitcoin system it should go more towards the original bitcoin owners who are storing their coins in the bank (why use banks at all with bitcoin?  I don't know.  I'm just thinking out this thought experiment).  I guess I'm saying that in a bitcoin system the bankers would be much less entitled to the reward of interest for lending.  The lion's share of it should go to the owner of the money itself.

A swiss bank account does sound fun :)
But I'm looking to start incorporate bitcoins into my small business and Dwolla is both slow, and limited to $10grand total for a merchant account in a year ( may be reading it wrong but that's what I see).  I'd have to set up at least two Dwolla accounts from what I see.
Wire transfers in Europe, on the other hand, seem to not have a yearly limit on how much you can transfer back and forth.
Maybe this will change 6 months from now, but at the moment it seems difficult to accomplish bi-directional transfers in the US, since I can't withdraw USD with an ACH transfer.
@_date: 2011-05-14 11:48:02
Well you need some sort of very liquid and generally available method for getting dollars into and out of bitcoins.  Dwolla has offered that service unconditionally while other services have not.  Alternatively you can figure out how to use an ACH wire transfer to directly send the money to MtGox, a viable option for many European banks but many American banks (like mine) do not support that option.
Also, the biggest problem is that Paypal was basically stealing money from bitcoiners.  Some big accounts got shut down because they didn't like that we were using their service to buy a competing electronic currency.
Paypal has recent history of abuse of power and outright theft and it really just isn't safe anymore.

Fractional reserve lending very literally creates money from nothing.  If you are required to hold 10% of what is deposited it is theoretically possible to create 10X the original deposit through lending of all subsequent deposits.
Bitcoin money supply, on the other hand, is basically fixed.  You can claim to have all this money to lend all you like but in the end you can only lend as much as you have.
When the money supply is fixed fractional reserve lending basically becomes a rickety ponzi scheme, the last one to cash out keeps it all.  Fractional reserve lending only works as long as you can print more money on demand.
Yours is a good question, and I've rolled it around in my head a lot.  I think I have the right answer too, but I'd love another opinion :)
EDIT: I suppose fractional reserve lending is out for bitcoin bankers, but maybe a system where they gave the coins owner a share of the profits in return for being allowed to loan out the owners coins?

Well the double spending prohibition is still applicable I think.
A given wallet.dat file will either be on a hard drive on one side of that ocean or another.  And in this scenario money can only be spent on one side of the ocean or the other.  So when the networks are reunited there will still be no double spending.
But as far as newly discovered blocks from mining go...I am unsure.
