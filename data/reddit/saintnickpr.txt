....this is basic math

purchase? paper wallets are free to make, if someone is trying to sell you one they are scamming you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:09:53
yeah dont get the appeal of buying hardware with preinstalled closed software to store all my funds...i'd rather make an offline paper wallet and im sure that cant be tampered with. full disclosure idk how the ledger works so if im wrong please correct me.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:57
I bought at 12...hope it stops fallin

How was Japan?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:32:11
Why did you cash out tho? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:12:00
Are you really that dumb? Youre gonna send untraceable money to an internet stranger? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:10:20
So memes === money ? We might be onto something lets make some bitmemes

"the dip is now!"
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:15
It dipped to 7.5k for like an hour the other day after it hit 11k
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:38
No... damned if i do damned if i dont i just keep quiet... if btc happens to crash then all my family/friends hate me lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:40:41
Theres a guy on nitrosports called RealG that lost 250btc in week 1 of NFL football last year. Lmao he’s a legend
Edit:  it was actually 216 btc ..... 3.1 million
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:05:41
arent paper wallets a 100% safe option too?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:21:20
pretty sure i read a few guys pissed that their stop orders @ 7.5k went through and they got shafted...it was reallly brief but it happened.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:26:22
I mean they sent it to an anonymous wallet not much they can do
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:44:07
They rattle something to the tune of “its a scam” or “its fake money” because they flat out dont understand the concept and have no interest in learning or adopting. Ignorance is bliss even when youre missing out on huge gains i guess
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:38:21
Early days it was/is popular in the darkweb for buying drugs since its untraceable... google silkroad its basically the reason a lot of people dont want to get involved. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:34:27
Dude... what dip??? Spiking to 19k ath then dropping instantly to 16 isnt really a dip especially considering BTC was at 16K this morning... if you bought at 19 ur an idiot lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:14
Sort of how bitfinex used people’s deposits after their collapse/hack....
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:19
Fuck it just go for it... if it goes even to 25k which im pretty sure it will thats 2x gains better than any other investment you could find
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:45:14
All type of investment is a gamble
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:06:01
lol k keep waiting for it to dip to 10k and buy a full one then. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:04:23
You can withdraw from gdax to any btc address with zero fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:02:19
This has got to be troll bait. Yeah lets just go back to the stoneage and not use energy for anything. No power no gas for transportation lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:14:42
Actually you would have tripled. Dont worry just get on and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:53:44
You dont need anything just make a new paper wallet and transfer the funds. You will need a way to extract the funds with a blockchain.info wallet or something that has paper wallet scanning. Google or search youtube for guides on how to make a paper wallet its very simple
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:13:45
Sigh this is me. Sold at 15k put several fkn orders yesterday at exactly 13.8 to get back in and didnt get it ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:09:40
Probably a paper wallet... althougj im not too clear on how you get the funds out of the paper wallet? Does blockchain.info have wallet scanning?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:49:09
Ill pass along my lambo and my yacht to my kids
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:39:43
you got in at a pretty good price just HODL or buy more
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:27:09
More like 25% from 19 to 14.5.. anyway if it starts the day at 15 shoots up to 19 for an hour, then goes back does to 16.... you cant really call that a dip lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:25:54
CRYPTOKITTY FOSHO
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:13:37
You gotta name it Satoshi
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:13:17
Yeah eth has been flat for a while. I liquidated all my eth for btc. ill diversify later when btc price stabilizes but right now thats where the gains are at
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:02
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:43:18
I dont understand where the fees are coming from at all.... most i get on CB is 1.5% i think thats fair. Anyway if im not in a hurry ill use gdax for 0 fees
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:06:47
Title is kind of a mouthful... go with something like “Bitcoin’s viability as an alternative to traditional banking systems” its better to make a statement than a question...
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:44:15
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:08:11
no fukin way lol you gotta do it with the offline linux fresh install method...but yeah i feel paper wallets are great and dont cost you anything.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:32:59
"the dip is now!"
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:44:45
not even a dip. its 3k up today lol 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:17:12
Yea except there are busses that go to the moon and a bunch more of them that crash into the ground 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:52:09
Cool thanks for the input ill try to get some balance ready
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:10:02
Print a paper wallet and give it to him
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:31:39
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:41:33
Here in puerto rico i only did it once with my drivers ID through coinbase. Bought eth and btc on gdax without doing anything else
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:31:35
Why 12/18? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:35:18
U got scammed
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:19:44
Lol yeah but that quote is shitty because its like saying you missed out on btc, then just buy in to whatever new coin is coming out now ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:44:02
if u wanna inherit a problem go for it
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:27:23
Not really
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:52:20
No, its not a dip. Its been at ~16 for a while. Price just leveled off it was growing ridiculously fast. Reached 19 for a quick sec then levelled off into the 16 area where its been for a while
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:28:23
Never happens because they just print more... this doesnt apply to btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:45:56
Dude deposit your coin to gdax for free and withdraw through there with ZERO fees to any btc address
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:56
Um yeah a correction back to a couple hours ago’s ATH then back up again... not much of a dip 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:46:57
u sure? just did 2 withdrawals totalling 1,300 and didnt get any fees
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:18:57
Its not up to the government. Btc is global government cant just shit out a new coin and force everyone in the world adopt it and abandon bitcoin lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:24:54
I just bought instant with my bank account and ate the 1.5% fee... at the rate its growing the fee already paid for itself and i locked in the price
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:37:02
you can get a lambo for under 50k?
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:15:58
so blockchain support wont respond to the fact that this guy somehow bypassed all their security prompts? i should have at least received SMS alerts and emails.
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:18:27
the account was accessed without any 2FA security and login email alerts.... how is that even possible? i had to enter the SMS code to access it today and i got an email today for my login attempt, but no such alerts when my wallet was accessed last friday
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:18:09
he was also right when he predicted a multi-year bear crypto market as soon as he cashed out last december
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:11
Chill out it will be back up soon. BTC will only go up
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:23:26
Nahh. BTC is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:03:42
Lol ether took a beating everyone emptied their eth wallets to buy BTC on the dip shouldve done the same 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:31:33
Yeah except the USD has the backing of USA with all its assets and might (military) and the US collects tax every year that also backs the currency and government.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:05:30
What the fuck are you talking about? What does russia &amp; china have to do with it? The guy i replied (who deleted his comment) said USD is a ponzi scheme with nothing backing it lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:17:54
Okay might as well erase this nonsensical comment too bud, im not even in the US ya idiot
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:51:37
I fear this might happen in PR. theres a big socialist movement here and it keeps getting traction... Yellow press keeps painting US as colonial rapists basically and the political left is pushing for PR's independence. I have no doubt in my mind it would end up just like Venezuela... same socialist motherfuckers different country.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:50:15
ah yess always blame the imperialist boogeyman
