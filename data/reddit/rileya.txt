Well put Erik. The quality of press covered stories has dropped substantially. It's a cut throat world in media these days so they will run any story that they feel can get the attention they need and there seems to be little oversight on if the story has real facts in it or not.

I would be very interested if somebody set up a web cam showing how busy the ATM is. Would love to be able to pull it up at any time and see if theres a big line or something :)

Done :) great videos, I had been watching them already and didn't even see the tip address prior.

I thought of that before posting but figured people would understand what I "meant" in my post. 
Id be perfectly happy with a POS SUPER low quality camera that has no view of the ATM, but simply a vantage point to see if there is people lined up or not... 
Come on now, Do you really think I would be proposing a camera that can see peoples private keys? lol. 
Sorry if you guys thought i was being stupid here... I'll explain myself better next time.

I had the "pleasure" of meeting Peter in may at the bitcoin 2013 conference. 
I feel as if I am the middle ground here. When I met him I was not impressed and felt like he was a good talker, but lacked substance and accomplishment behind his voice. One example I have of this was during one of many speeches he made, he was pumping and pumping the audience with all the "dreams" and very enthusiastically saying "people in this room will rise up and become rich". It's hard to explain, but me and my 2 business partners who were there looked at each other and shook our heads and thought "this guy seems fake" 
The previous points made are relatively true. Coin lab has not really done much accept try to sue mt gox. Lol. 
And alydian was sooo late to the mining game, the second that they announced it, I laughed especially at the prices, I shook my head and said "what kinda idiot would pay that" 
Peter seems to be all talk and has a way with "impressing" investors to get them to pony up cash. 
On the flip side, he HAS done lots to promote bitcoin. Being one of the founders of the bitcoin foundation, putting on the very successful conference in may. Etc... 
Overall, I would not do business with him and was very glad when he stepped down from his seat on the foundation board.

Great video but I would not have mentioned the 100 dollar thing. It makes the video outdated simply if the exchange rate changes and we all know that can happen in a blink.
