So how about setting up a public escrow wallet for folks to send coin to, to be cashed out for dwb donations on a weekly schedule? They don't have to accept BTC, we could organize, fundraise, and donate the fiat results.

I went to O, checked it out, found better price at Amazon for everything I found that I might want. If I can pay less money via gyft to amazon card, what exactly is O offering?

But aren't all the third parties relevant to fiat currency all regulated by governments?

I don't have the tech knowledge to fully understand. Can you eli5 what this means?

That's more of doge territory. They're the crypto market leader in charity work, with several reputable donation groups.

If you sell digital product and don't accept BTC, you're behind the curve.

How about, because while I follow BTC news and trends as much as I'm able, there are a great deal of smarter, savvier, and better educated people here whose opinions I value as much if not more than an internet article writer? 
Not that I've even made one of those posts. I want to occasionally, but I expect to get booed out of the room by the BTC elite if I do.

How much data can be added this way? 
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:07:51
It's not like you can't dump it straight to fiat immediately. As soon as a site adds BTC they get an influx of folks who want to exercise their buying power who might have never used the site otherwise. I can't imagine why a vendor would turn down a perfectly legitimate revenue source other than some degree of ignorance about it.
@_date: 2014-09-27 20:29:02
Probably. What I don't understand is how there is a wall between east and west when BTC is a factor. Doesn't it by its nature remove such barriers?

Not just directly into state or federal coffers either, or it's just a generalized distribution of the same incentives. Make it go towards inner city restoration, education, healthcare... The areas that prevent kids from turning into criminals in the first place.

I missed out on getting bitcoin cash with the split. I have old coins sitting in circle and some newer pre fork coins on mycelium. Qoinpro sent me an email telling me I could acquire my bitcoin cash post fork by depositing my coins on their site. I'm trying to find out if this is legit and the best route. Can someone with knowledge of this process help me out?

I got screwed out of savings by Garza back in '14, just heard about the lawsuit. Did I miss out? How do I get my fair compensation?

And unlike heavy gold, bitcoin can be shipped at near lightspeed.

Which is what he should have done years ago, the stupid greedy fuck. He deserves jail for endangering everyone who has ever been to his site.
