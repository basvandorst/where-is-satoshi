Been designing the Multi-sig wallets so simple even a business person can do it and some interesting things came up like the order that you use when you create multi-signature wallets. My next problem is cashing-in the multi-sig wallet - I'm not using the wallet.dat so when I get the second HEX I get back when the second person signs the Multi-sig does not say true- sendrawtransaction the HEX also gives me an error error: {"code":-25,"message":""} any help would be welcome..

This is the reason why business people do not trust Bitcoins. I'm developing a HD-BIP32 Bitcoin business wallet with multi-sig - video   - Without the right business tools Bitcoin cannot go to the next level. Imagine a business using Bitstamp - they be loosing money and TRUST as the biggest part of the failure. Companies using their own HD-BIP32 business wallets in their own infrastructure with their own security will be able to feel safer and offer their customers  better and more responsive feedback when a problem happens.
