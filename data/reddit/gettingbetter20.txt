I'm kind of in a similar scenario also. I'm currently facing up to 41 months in a federal prison.
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:03:36
It's not a flat 41 months, it's definitely 0-41. He said the prosecutor agreed to probation but it's ultimately up to the judge. I had a really bad Xanax addiction and I'm being accused of buying them through the DW from Canada. They raided my home and found other drugs. They are converting everything to 290 kilos of weed which makes me a level 24 category 2 offender. I was released with the condition i go to treatment. I've been to rehab and tons of Intensive Outpatient and almost have 6 months clean now. I go to meetings and I'm very happy to be clean but the stress of going to prison has been eating at me. I'm sure you understand brother. I have your perspective about how things happened for a reason. God was doing for me what I couldn't.

If the feds offered me a plea of 0-41 months for drug-related charges do you think I will get 41 months? I'm eligible for probation but I feel like if they were going to give me probation it would be in the plea agreement. I'm currently out on O.R. with a pending case.

Is the Bart Simpson flag bearish or bullish?

Thanks for sharing. Do you have any suggestions to find out more on bots?

Geez 30%! They would be better off having token people bought with a credit card. I'm guessing these are commissioned 30% too

I've been thoroughly convinced we are in a simulation since February of this year actually. The nail in the coffin for me is the double slit experiment. I'm just wondering if I chose to be uploaded in this world and picked this life or if we are living in chaos. I recently made a contract and signed it for people from outside the simulation to contact me. Are you one of those people?

Oh shoot I ruined it lol. I'm dressing up for Halloween as Ed Bassmaster and I can't even quote his shit right

It's weird how the price can flip like that and make 8500 look good.

Anything cold storage

I remember this, this taught me what an inverted Bart means. Thank you!

My brother always goes in dooms day scenarios every since the precious metals bull run around a decade ago. Granted he was stocked with silver before it popped but he never sold any and now he's just waiting for the economy to collapse and the dollar to fail. I just don't see it happening anytime in our lifetime. Especially not in the next 10-15 years.

The kind of beads that go in your butt?

Is the movie based off the book?

I wonder how it can be unsafe if I set it up myself?

Third, who buys plate for decoration anymore???
@_date: 2019-12-25 05:09:17
Probably sooner.

But I always studied last minute reviewing my notes, sometimes on the drive to school.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:12:36
No :(

It was sealed and I setup my own seeds.
@_date: 2019-12-12 06:53:05
True...I didn't think much of it as long as I was writing down my own seeds but who knows anymore
@_date: 2019-12-12 06:52:00
How I would get one to rip people off?
@_date: 2019-12-12 07:21:56
I can't find anything on Google, someone ordered one where it had a card in it asking them to text a number for the seed. My thoughts going forward is who knows what kind of technology is out there and why take the risk. I just ordered one from their official site. Here's a link to what I could find

It sounds like they are worried about counterfeit currency?
@_date: 2019-09-21 23:37:06
Why $9,042?
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:03:33
But Bitcoin from a Bitcoin ATM. Google the closest location from you.

It's interesting that something similar to this happened in November 2017.
@_date: 2019-09-22 06:23:26
What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:05:56
Closer to 14 trillion, our national debt will be twice that by then.
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:40:52
