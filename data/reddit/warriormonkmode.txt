Literally every doctrine of idea has its own barbs that make it difficult to rid yourself of. It's called the Lucifer principal. You're getting caught up on the details.
As far as what he's saying to people, I understand what he's saying and why. Perhaps you should focus on raising your IQ so you could get what he's saying and not get lost and start calling it "word salad."

What you consider smart I consider mediocre and populist. Just like it was popular to believe in the flatness of Earth, the miasma theory, and creationism. You blindly validate these "intellectuals" like they're some priesthood, not unlike the religious zealots you readily criticize. The irony.
As for me being a "fan" of Peterson? No, I'm not a fan and don't much care for the guy. I think his idea of society "going back" to tradconism is ridiculous and naive. Technology has ensured that whichever direction society goes next will be uncharted territory.
He wants to revive a dead institution, rather than making something better from it's ashes.
But I don't expect an NPC, someone without an ounce of original programming, to understand the nuance of the man or his philosophy. For whatever criticisms I have of this foolish man, his psychological understanding of the human condition is something to respect.
But since you're little more than a sheep, following whatever popular trend is tied to the proverbial stick in front of your face, I am not surprised that someone like yourself is unable to grasp the complexity of disagreeing with someone while still respecting his knowledge and positions. You look on TV and let whatever ideology that chooses to possess you at the time take the wheel, much like a religious fanatic who blames God and the devil for their life choices.
You're just an NPC following your programming, and I pity you because of it. Take care.

You don't have an argument so no rebuttal necessary. Your argument essentially boils down to "lots of people disagree because they don't like what he says!" Refute the data, not the man.

Don't let the school door hit yea on your way out to the short bus.

They (religions) gained traction because they provided a sense of structure and order in a chaotic and confusing world.
What makes religion "special" is the transfer of ideas through swaths of the population through a thing called "books."
Get a clue, you're looking at the wrong angle of what he's trying to "sell."

Yes, that must be it. It's just not possible that you may be wrong.
Stay in school, kid. Keep taking political advice from geniuses such as Opera and Taylor Swift.

Not seeing an argument in your word salad, ironically enough.

Better to be thought a fool, then to open your mouth and remove all doubt then.

Today I learned that following the data from scientific literature = sexism.

You don't debate at all, from what I've gathered through this exchange. Whether that's because you're incompetent or unable remains to be seen.
