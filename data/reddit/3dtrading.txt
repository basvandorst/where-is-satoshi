The technical term for what this is doing is "synthesizing a floating peg order" — you set you desired *market depth* (distance from the spread, either below the buy price or above the sell price), and as the price moves, your order is removed and replaced multiple times per second in order to maintain that depth. This way, the only way your order gets filled is with a market order large enough to sweep the order book all the way to your chosen depth. The crucial seconds from the video explaining this part is from about 1:00 on.
**So the "algorithm" in this situation is "maintain order depth as specified by user." :)**
There is no way to accomplish this with typical exchange infrastructure — the time it takes for electrical signals to get from your computer in America to Binance (in Hong Kong), for example, is far too long to adjust your order placement quickly enough.
To solve this, we've built what we're calling "trading rigs" — trading rigs are cloud-hosted computers like mining  rigs or gaming rigs, only in this case they manage algorithmic trading bots *located in the same Amazon AWS warehouses as the exchanges themselves.* This means the same low latency that Wall Street HFT guys have spent the last 20 years chasing, becomes available to your 12 year old brother who loves Guitar Hero — no matter where he is in the world.
The title of this post is in no way an exaggeration. ;)
