My fav moment was when backpage decided to only accept bitcoin which vexed many technologically challenged prostitutes

What happens when that conflict occurs? What decides which transaction gets access? 
They way I see it is that everyone needs to agree on all the transactions that get to make it when the books get closed. They can't have a double spend somewhere in the there after the books are closed.

How do fiat currencies determine/influence bitcoin's value? If there are people willing to trade gold for btc wouldn't that make it still viable?

Vous etes tous des noobs dans lfrancais. Tassez vous de d'la!

From your commenting history I can tell you're very involved in this sub. It's quite beautiful. Thank you.

Refreshingly smooth criticism handling. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:44:57
I wish I could follow them around and study their ways.

Basically you'd be cutting out the middleman. Advertisers would pay using bitcoins for the clicks in realtime, and you'd have total control over what products that get advertised with your settings. No products you don't like will be advertising on your profile.
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:26:09
I've watched all the videos but unfortunately he didn't go into too much detail about a double spending attack.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:17:51
Yeah. I'm now a owner of Second Life Lindens left over change.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:08:58
I guess you'd just have reputation stats. Using the bitcoin protocol would ensure that BitProfile would know if the transaction was made since the ledger is public. Advertisers would then have a certain % ratio of clicks paid out. If the advertiser doesn't pay out the, let's say 7 cents worth, of clicks it was dealt then the network wouldn't display their ads until the money is flowing freely. Kind of like an eBay reputation. I'm really open to ideas as I'm just brainstorming this right now. 
Either that or the advertiser pays it out and then the network takes care of advertising it through profiles of people who like the product until the click is provided. If the network was huge this would be a matter of seconds. What do you think?
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:56:28
I think you mean wary.

I'm pretty jealous man. I've lived in Thailand for a year and loved it. I'm studying programming now too. Pm me for your details if you wanna hang out next time I'm down there.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:16:38
Took 48 hours. Wouldn't say that's quick. Does it get faster over time?
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:43:17
I don't understand this matter enough to know what could cause it. I'm just suggesting a hypothetical situation where our fiat currency essentially became worthless; what would happen to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:40:54
This is reference to the blind signature protocol? Does the mining process drop off all the of bad data trying to get in?
I have a hard time comprehending how honest nodes get ahead exactly.
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:54:58
I've googled and came up with nothing of this nature. It would be a program you download that's open source.
@_date: 2015-11-14 00:40:14
Sent 0.315 instead of 0.0315. I make a very shitty starting salary as a programmer and can't afford a slip up this big. I might not have as much as most people on this sub but to me that was close to all I had sadly
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:53:27
Massively, but I'm from a relatively economically deprived area and can't afford to move. I only make 35 000 CAD a year and can barely stay on top of bills. I have 7 years of post secondary education debt to pay off cause I also have a worthless liberal arts major on top of my programming degree. I offer drives to people and hustle bitcoins to try and make a little pocket change. This kind of thing is utterly devastating...
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:14:09
No but I'll send them your way thank you for the tip!!
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:15:50
About 20$ an hour. I don't do much freelance work.
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:20:23
Yeah you got me beat. This is the sort of story I was hoping to hear to make me feel a little better. Mostly just relating to other people who deal in bitcoin so I can feel a little understood.
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:26:39
That's fucking terrible man sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:41:07
Who's hiring an intermediate C++ programmer? I excel at Templated Metaprogramming, move semantics, algorithms, RAII, complex design patterns and all best C++11 practices. Experience with all the latest in boost, too. I'd move anywhere in the world... I just have an incredible amount of student debt and would like to feel like I'm not drowning in it all the time.
@_date: 2015-11-14 05:14:45
I meant that my address was a localbitcoins address. Hers was a wallet. Sorry for the confusion
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:11:21
I was selling the bitcoins. Tried getting the rest of the money but the address already sent the money elsewhere. I'm fucked. Drinking cheap gin my roommate gave me and being a baby instead.

edit: it's a localbitcoins.com address

I guess the expression "I'm an idiot" prevailed here.
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:59:08
I'll send a resume thanks for the tip man
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:31:41
Being mature and not fussing over what you don't control is nowhere near as easy either.
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:57:22
Welp, they immediately transfered their amount to another address and completely ignored my pleas.
@_date: 2015-11-14 06:59:23
Dude thanks for sharing. It's not worth much but I read your story and felt it. It must be the worst thing to see it just sitting there, out of reach...
@_date: 2015-11-14 01:58:47
I would but they're not me.
@_date: 2015-10-18 21:37:05
But does that mean that I get the money back or something?
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:17:54
Definitely not getting it back now: 
@_date: 2015-10-18 21:39:13
Yeah, that logo.
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:23:24
I can't even believe it... Thank you so fucking much... I owe you big for this.
@_date: 2015-11-14 06:56:52
First one I've ever gotten, thank you. Looking forward to checking the changetip thing out
@_date: 2015-11-14 00:06:11
Yeah the person hasnt answered and it's been hours.
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:24:23
Thank you very much I just figured out how changetip works
