I think Bitcoin is slowly shedding that reputation, personally. And I also think we should continue working to rid get of said reputation *further*, which is characterized by trying not to associate with people who should not be associated with. 
Yes, I acknowledge Silk Road did help the currency get off the ground, but the focus should now be on getting the mainstream/financial worlds into BTC. And even though people may combat the suggestion of the latter, the fact of the matter is, we need to show how Bitcoin can not only be a suitable substitute for the current money system -- but that it's a better one.

I'm confused. If I'm a resident of Canada, and hypothetically want to sell my Bitcoins for CAD, what would I be taxed on?

I hope this was sarcastic. If not, you should read "The Big Short"

Oh yes, sorry, just my poor graph reading. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:20:06
Yes, I know.
The problem is, the rest of the world will continue to stereotype, regardless of any reddit posts. I'm proposing we try and develop slightly more formally as a sub-reddit/community, rather than expecting everybody else to take us seriously when they are greeted with stupid memes and an overwhelming sense of niche political beliefs they don't identify with.

I'm sorry, but I think you misunderstand my post, along with my opinion. 
I personally want Bitcoin to become successful. I've been involved since 2011, and when I first heard of it, I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.
My point is that it I feel many others don't have the same view, and this is partly because of how the Bitcoin community presents itself. I see this sub-reddit being ridiculed on other reddit posts, and I can't blame some of them for their opinions. Some of the absolute garbage posted here is valid enough evidence for the ones who DON'T take us seriously to become some of the (top-rated posts in other threads)[ 
I'm saying in order for more people to take us seriously, both on reddit and in the real world, we need to improve the "formality" of the community. This can be achieved by exactly what you said, opening it to all kinds of people, so the rest don't see us as anti-statist "angsty nerds".

There's no need to be a dick. That's the kind of stuff I was trying to target in my post. When you say stuff like that you sound like a child.

I have a question if anyone can answer it:
Why do people use VirtEx over mtgoxCAD? VirtEx fees are astronomical, 3.00% both ways, compared to gox's 0.6%. Yet VirtEx has almost 2x the daily volume.

If I understand this right, wouldn't the last graph imply BTC is currently undervalued, as the Bid sum is 3x larger than the Ask sum, leading to a lot of demand? If not, could someone correct me on this?

Eh, I don't know about the "not having to worry about money ever again" part. But they definitely won't have to worry for a nice while.

He said the market is always right. History has shown it can be wrong. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:26:01
Yeah, just clarified this is another post. My bad.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:24:29
Oh, sorry, that was my bad. I assumed you were talking about 1/100th units, as the comment you were replying too was. And I did some bad math anyways, that would have been a 10000% increase. That's crazy, but I thought that was what you meant as I have seen speculation of similar magnitudes on this subreddit before.
In that case, yes, I totally agree with you, 3 BTC is totally possible in the next 2 weeks. I might be inclined to say 1 week actually. Sorry for the confusion.

I have a question, if anyone could answer it.
What are ASICs, and why does inputting their specs into mining calculators yield ungodly results? What is the catch?

If the UKIP is as bad as people make them out to be, I believe we should not actively encourage them to partake in the Bitcoin economy in any way. Keep the hated and the fringe groups out of Bitcoin until we see a lot more mainstream adoption. Bad supporters can cripple movements.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:22:52
I don't know about anybody else, but I would consider a ~1000% increase in value over two weeks way beyond "bubble territory".

I did not once imply he was an idiot, I'm just stating that *sometimes* following the herd can lose people money. Even if we allow the market itself to be 'always right', there are occasions when blindly following trends can prove to be a wrong decision.

Attaching any political ideology to Bitcoin is counter-productive. By boasting BTC as some "liberatarian" techno-currency, you're only going to hinder it's growth. A very large amount of people don't take libertarianism seriously, and Bitcoin really does need to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2013-03-09 22:14:01
Not necessarily. Sometimes, the trend is very, very, wrong and the ones who take the risk of going against it are heavily rewarded for such a risk.

An airport walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Why the long face?" 
The airport replies, "I just found out I have terminal cancer." 
Don't want any BTC; infact, put this towards whichever joke you find the funniest.
