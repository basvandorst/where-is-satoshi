This was almost me.... so close.  I am still so new to this and I fought the FOMO.  I'm just doing DCA weekly and waiting for the price to drop to at least 7k until I do a lump sum

Well the benefit of it is that you don’t have to track the cost and you end up accruing just as much as of you had just done lump sums. 
To track what you spend just pick an amount and a time frame and divide by weeks or days. So say you want to spend 2k on bitcoin from now till December,
2000/26 weeks is 76 per week or convert it to days

That would be amazing. I’d jump all over the chance to buy bitcoin at that price.

I think another cool think about DCA is that, for me at least, it keeps you from FOMO buying.  I almost did a lump sum at 13k because I thought "what if it goes higher" but with DCA it doesn't matter because either way I am going to be invested but I can still wait and make a larger purchase if it every goes down again

Look Guys, Trump is no moron
Does a moron bankrupt a Casino and look directly at a solar eclipse? I don't think so.

It really is equal parts frusterating and fascinating how thick headed people are.  I'm new so I'm still excited to tell people and there have only been one or two who actually try to see the value.  Most people just disregard it without even having any evidence for why they do.  Don't get me wrong, I see the problems with Bitcoin and I am not deluded into thinking there is no chance it can fail but the underlying tech is unquestionably here to stay.   
It is wise advice to probably not talk about it especially if and when it starts going well above 50k.  I will probably start playing it off real soon that I gave up on it and I'm really kicking myself for doing it when it really goes up in value

Yeah, if you go to this site you can see how the Mayer got really high every time before the bubble popped and crashed.  It seems like it has been dead on every time.

You refer to your dad by his first name? seriously though, that's cool.  I just got into it and only wished I known six months or even six week sooner

Well if you are holding more than you are willing to ride to 0 then you bought too much. Only invest what you are willing to lose. That’s the golden rule of investing crypto “only invest what you are willing to lose” 
I’d love a crash to give me a chance to buy more

Yeah, there basically is no tax incentive anymore for owning a home and if you are stuck in a 30yr mortage you are paying a giant amount of interest to the banks every month. The only way owning a home makes sense is if you are able to afford a 15 year mortage

I am new too... very new.  
DCA stands for "Dollar Cost Averaging"  
It's a tactic where instead of investing one large lump sum payment you spread payments out over fixed payments.   
So say you wanted want to invest 1k in bitcoin from now until the end of the year.  You could throw all that in in one payment but you would then have to try and figure where the best cost will be which is very hard with Crypto. So instead you could just put in 50 per week and you will on average probably have the same amount of bitcoin at the end of the day because you would be buying when the market is high or low.   
They say it is the safest way to invest because say the market crashes to zero you are not going to be out of a lot of money but if it keeps going up you will still have been invested in bitcoin

I personally take financial advise from someone who bankrupted a casino.
