What if they no longer control the site? And why would Gox care after they already lost tons of users BTC?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:31:35
Wow, what a bunch of scum.

Yes, but why would he delete his work? He had to have a few different wallets to test out his code after releasing. I wouldn't doubt if he has around ~5% of the total market cap.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:47:53
There was an inconsistency in the code, I am not really sure why.

Mt. Gox using SHA256/SHA512? The trading card seller?
Time to change all my passwords just incase.

That's just the genesis block, I know. But he mined for months afterwards to keep the network running, and to verify and transactions that other people were trying.
He has to be mega-rich.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:33:27
His mining progress. There's no reason he would delete the coins he mined the first few months, that's like throwing away a baby.
It's nice to know he is still alive though, since he posted that the guy the news has been heckling isn't the real guy. 
Wow I love btc.

Welcome to the end times. :/
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:13:42
Wow this is bollocks.
Sorry to see you go, doge inches closer to no moon trip :(
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:57:23
Yeah, but once he released it. He mined the hell out of it to support the network.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:25:07
Looks sketchy...
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:11:15
Here is a screenshot incase it goes down.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:52:26
They called him cryptsy. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:41:19
just noticed this, are we among a hostile takeover?
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:08:29
But how do we know we can trust them to do that? what if they just don't care anymore since the site is toasted.
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:27:04
Wouldn't it take like 10 minutes with John The Ripper/THC to crack hashed passwords?
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:28:49
So he has probably made a bit of money off BTC?
I imagine this is how he has never actually been found, he is probably sitting on a few million(or hundred million).
We have to remember he would have been mining @ 1 difficulty those first few months after releasing BTC. He was probably getting a few thousand blocks a month. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:38:23
Well they might come through.
Anyone use this site?
I just want to see how a transaction works for my wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:20:35
So you are saying this site is fraud? Should I tell my cc company to cancel it? Or wait for my coins?
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:58:30
I just don't understand how to perform a purchase. I just want a small amount to play with the system before I buy a real amount
