Subject: Well the Changelly.com and Qtum token fraud continue and I received zero tokens and 22.5010622 QTUM (ERC20) were stolen from me.
 
Well it's official after waiting for at least 14 days to receive a refund from Changelly.com, their transaction was completed today and I received "zero" tokens as a refund. Since it seems that Texas is the only state in America actually taking action against websites that are involved in international cryptocurrency theft, I will send a copy of my final results to the Texas governor and the Texas Attorney General in hopes of getting a Cease and Desist order against Changelly.com and Qtum.org.
This is such a tragedy for me as a disabled Army veteran to lose over $1000 dollars worth of Qtum token at the hands of international thieves like Changelly.com and Qtum.org. At some point, I am sure America at the federal level and states like Texas will step up to the plate and shut these international fraud and theft cryptocurrency exchanges and tokens down.
The pain and anxiety I went through during the last 14 days are off the charts. I have truly suffered a great loss financially and emotionally and I hope to find relieve in federal court.
What a horribly dishonest group of people at Changelly.com and Qtum.org. They are thieves and frauds, and should not be allowed to continue to steal from Americans or anyone for that matter.
I want to thank Interpol Police and the Czech Republic police for at least trying to help me. I will not be sending out any further emails to anyone in this matter except to Changelly.com and Qtum.org.
