Could you elaborate? It's my understanding that `addwitnessaddress addr` will always produce the same Segwit address for any given `addr`. As long as the private key for `addr` is backed up, how can this be dangerous?

You're framing the issue as if one who is opposed to "bits" would favour using SI prefixes instead.  This is not a binary choice!  I, for one, agree that the basic bitcoin unit should be equal to 100 satoshi, and I also agree that SI prefixes are too confusing for most people.  However, I don't like the name "bit" itself because it's already in widespread use with a different meaning.  We should come up with a new name that is unique.
Here's a practical example (heard in the near future) of potential confusion:
 - "Sir, you're using a 4096-bit private key.  That's not secure enough nowadays.  Your private key should have at least 16384 bits."
 - "16384 bits? That's bloody expensive!"
Moreover, it's not like we're running out of short words in the English language.  Why would we purposefully introduce a new source of confusion?!
@_date: 2014-05-03 12:58:30
Better than "bits".
@_date: 2014-05-03 12:26:35
Here's one variation that just sprung to mind: "rubit". It sounds less geeky than "xubit", it's easy to pronounce, and not confusing. Moreover, it lends itself naturally to the Bitcoin rebranding that the name change will require: the new Bitcoin logo design could be inspired by a rubi (the gemstone).
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:04:34
**Proposal: "Coin"**.  This idea seemed at first trivial to the point of dismissal, but
its advantages have since won me over.  Foremost, it's simple, casual, and non-geeky.
Moreover, despite the word "coin" itself being a regular English word, there is little
chance of confusion. Examples:
* "Your coffee will be 10,000 coins, please." 
* "I sent you the 1 million coins for the rent yesterday."
* "Funny comment. Here's a 100 coin tip."
* "Do you take Bitcoin? Yes? Great! Here's 1000 coins."
But wouldn't 1 Coin (= 100 satoshis) be confused with 1 BTC (= 100,000,000 satoshis)?.
Well, at first there could be some confusion, but I reckon this period would be brief.
Moreover, after the new name "Coin" is introduced, everyone in the community would be
strongly encouraged to stop talking about BTC or "bitcoins" (of course we would still
be talking about the "Bitcoin" system).  It would also help if the currency code XBT 
or XBC were to become commonplace, replacing the (non-standard anyway) use of BTC.
(And after a while, after the old usage of 1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis has been
forgotten, I can easily imagine that any mention of "bitcoins" would be unmistakenly
interpreted as meaning 100 satoshis.  There are real life examples of such currency 
@_date: 2014-05-03 12:47:18
My current favourite is "rubit":
* It reminds you of a gemstone and therefore value.
* It is non-ambiguous.
* It's short and easy to pronounce.
* It lends itself to easy re-branding and logo design.
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:04:45
No, because it uses the dreaded SI prefix and reuses the word "bit" as a unit of currency.  Moreover, it sounds geeky as hell.
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:58:35
The whole point of the post was for people to suggest ideas.
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:55:58
I like the idea of reusing or tweaking the name of an old currency. One suggestion in this vein: ["aureus"](  It has the advantage of sounding "goldy", which is very appropriate as Bitcoin is supposed to be "digital gold".
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:44:21
Great point!  But I suspect goldbugs will not be convinced until their precious gold becomes dirt cheap.  Reason: it's so shiny!
(And by the way: by "dirt cheap" I mean "as cheap as silver is today".  Even if there's plenty of gold in asteroids, the economics of bringing it to Earth mean that it will never be as cheap as aluminium or iron is today.)
@_date: 2014-05-03 12:50:16
Mubees sounds better.
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:18:30
I also have no problem with metric prefixes.  However, we must realise that they confuse and alienate a lot of people, and not just in the US.  Not to mention that attaching the prefixes milli and micro to money has a negative psychological impact.  The Dogecoin folks were right in avoiding this trap.
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:07:18
Another idea that has been bandied about: "zib".  It sounds a bit intergalactic, but at least it's unique and short.
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:30:11
Brilliant! This is actually my favourite so far.  "Turing" is short, memorable, and not likely to cause confusion (there are already many units named after people and no one was ever confused concerning which usage you meant).
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:02:44
One suggestion: "xubit" (pronounced "zubit" or "subit" depending on the user's native tongue).  It's short, and non-confusing.  And though geeks would realise that its roots (microbitcoin -&gt; µbitcoin -&gt; ubitcoin -&gt; ubit -&gt; xubit), the general public need not know or care.
@_date: 2014-05-03 12:22:56
Me too, I prefer "mikes" to "bits".  Though I think an even better name can be found.
@_date: 2014-05-03 13:42:31
Me too.  I've suggested that precise word in a different post that got buried.

Good to hear!


Also good to hear. Please correct me if I misunderstood, but you seem to imply that direct communication happened in the past but it's not presently happening.  Given the consequences, this seems very dangerous to me.  I think that direct communication should be happening **now**.


If their incentives are purely monetary, then they can be reasoned with. After all, the ongoing conflict and the uncertainty associated with a fork is bad for business. Moreover, a savvy business operator in the Bitcoin space must be aware that decentralisation is a key feature of Bitcoin, and therefore any measure that kills decentralisation (like a wild block size increase) will also kill the golden-egg goose. Therefore, I'm sure the miners surely must understand on some level that Core's reluctance to increase the block size wildly is not part of some evil plot to deny them of fees, but is instead aimed at preserving a fundamental property of Bitcoin, right?
Anyway, I'm still finding it hard to reconcile the present brinkmanship with the assumption that both parties want what's best for Bitcoin and are operating with perfect information about each other's intentions and motivations. Which is why I can't help but to return to the subject of direct communication.  I reckon it's the only thing that can bring us back from the brink. And let's face it: the nuclear option that's being bandied about would be disastrous for everybody.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:54:24
Jihan seems to be under the misguided impression that 2nd layer solutions are an existential threat to miners. Core needs to explain to him that 2nd layer solutions will greatly expand the pool of potential users, and therefore make the mainchain even more valuable.
This is an opportunity to start a dialogue. Let's not dwell any more on past misunderstandings and let's start talking now! Please reach out to him, Core devs!
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:24:08
Cheers for your recent interview on Mad Bitcoins -- you should do more! ;-)
About the supposed communication problems: one thing that as an outside observer strikes me as odd is that communication between devs and miners seems to happen mostly via broadcast on Twitter or blog posts, and there doesn't seem to be direct personal communication.  Is this impression correct, or are there indeed direct communication channels between devs and large miners which us plebes are unaware of?
If no direct communication exists, I reckon it's important to initiate that dialogue. Recent events make me think that a fair amount of the block size conflict may be simply due to miscommunication and miners having the wrong impression that Core is out to eat their lunch.
Not to mention that there may be malicious actors deliberately spreading misinformation, which makes those direct channels of communication even more important!

We are now deep into the "Then they fight you" stage. It's crucial we pay close attention to Andreas' message if we want to reach the "Then you win" stage.
It's easy to lay all the blame on trolls and shills, but we also have part of the blame. There are too many naive users on this forum who are too quick to demonize people with different opinions, who shut off all suggestions for dialogue, and who are cheerleaders for radical destructive solutions that would break Bitcoin apart.
So, how do we tell apart honest actors from malicious ones? Here's some guidelines:
 * Honest actors are polite and civil. Malicious ones are rude and only add aggravation to a discussion.
 * Honest actors understand nuance. Malicious actors like to paint others in black and white.
 * Honest actors apply the [principle of charity]( Malicious ones always "misinterpret" other people's comments.
 * Honest actors understand that the world is a complicated place, and that if someone disagrees with you, that does not mean they are part of some evil conspiracy.
(Feel free to add your own guidelines.)
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:13:46
Cheers for this. It's a great infographic.
I'm now fully convinced that Jihan and Core need to start talking directly to each other. If Jihan's primary motivation is profit, he can be convinced that supporting some sort of compromise with Core will result in much higher profits for him.
Jihan's post is a timid opening to a negotiation. I hope someone from Core has the good sense to follow through and reaches out to him. Can we please put our differences aside and start talking?
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:29:16
Indeed. I hope someone from Core takes him up on his offer and accepts a negotiation.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:34:35
I agree, especially because many Core developers are already on record as stating they do support an eventual hard fork for increasing the block size.
Dear Core developers: reach out to the miners and start negotiating with them. I suspect that if you offer them SegWit now, plus a commitment to a 2MB hard fork soon, many miners will jump on board, including Jihan.
And please ignore all the negative people saying that it's a waste of time and there's no point in negotiating, etc. I suspect that miners are just looking for a gracious way out, and if you offer to negotiate they'll follow through.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:00:43
I find your answer to be a bit disingenuous. Core does have a lot of power in shaping opinion and building consensus. In fact, I'm pretty sure that if Core developers put forth a plan **now** for a modest and gradual block size increase to occur post-Segwit, you would convince many people "on the other side" and get many reluctant miners to jump on board.
To give more details: propose that the hard fork happens 6 months after Segwit. And to avoid a drastic increase in block size, propose that the block size after the hard fork will be 1.1MB, with 0.1MB increases every month until a maximum of 2MB (or 3MB, or 4MB) is reached.
I still haven't found a convincing argument against this sort of plan...
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:45:21
It's a valid concern, though realistically Satoshi is very unlikely to take any action that would harm his creation.
I've wondered often what would I do if I were Satoshi and I wished for this issue to become moot.  Obviously, the first thing would be to make an announcement outlining my plans with a clear calendar. Also, the plans would be signed in such a way that no doubts about their veracity could arise.  Assuming a 1,000,000 Bitcoin stash, here's what I would do:
* A declaration of how many coins I intended to keep for my personal stash, to do as I please. Say, 210,000.  I chose this number because it represents 1% of all coinage, and a larger percentage could cause unneeded uncertainty.
* A declaration of how many coins I would proportionally redistribute to current holders of Bitcoin.  This should constitute the bulk of the stash, say, 500,000.  Though it may seem silly to give away such a bounty, it would reward and encourage holders, and may even make my own stash more valuable!
* A declaration of how many coins I would sell per day regardless of price, and the total number of coins I intended to sell this way.  Since after the halvening the daily influx through mining will be 1800 Bitcoin, it's important that the amount I sell not be large in proportion.  Say, 180 Bitcoins per day, halvening every four years.  Depending on the total amount I declared to be sold this way, this period could last several decades.
* Donate the rest to charity, or use it to fund Bitcoin development.
(**Note that the above plans are what I would do if I were Satoshi.  Obviously Satoshi is free to do what they please...**)

I would advise everyone to go easy on the schadenfreude.  While this attack shows that Bitcoin made the right technical choice in having a relatively "dumb" backbone without Turing-complete smart contracts, it may also undermine the public's trust in cryptocurrency.
Fortunately, Ethereum is still under the mainstream radar.  Otherwise, I can assure you the mainstream news would be lumping all cryptocurrencies in the same basket of FUD, and I would not be surprised to see headlines about "Bitcoin being hacked".
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:54:55
No, Satoshi's stash is nowhere near that massive.  It's estimated to be around 1 million coins.  The 11 million figure comes from the parent's hypothetical.

As I stated above, while I very much doubt that Satoshi would do anything that would harm his creation, I also don't think that this issue can be swept under the rug so easily.

Political scientists disagree on a lot of things, but one thing they do agree is [Duverger's Law]( which basically states that electoral systems such as the US's (which uses first-past-the-post) favour two-party systems.

This is a step in the right direction. If I were Core I would put out a plan wherein the block size increase hardfork would be triggered automatically some 6 months after the activation of Segwit, so there would be plenty of advance warning for the hardfork, and we could get Segwit must faster.
And to those who think any sort of compromise is bad:
 * Many Core devs have already expressed their support for an eventual block size increase beyond Segwit. So why not do it **now** if this means ending the civil war?
 * Plenty of miners think they'll make more money in the long term with larger block sizes. We should take their view into account, because after all they are the ones securing the network.
 * This compromise is heavily biased towards the Core side anyway. Think about it: the block size increase is very modest, and buys us time for 2nd layer solutions to deploy and mature. Once those are in widespread usage, the clamour for larger blocks will die.
 * There's a good chance that without some sort of compromise we'll have a contentious hardfork. How is that better than a consensual hardfork?

@_date: 2011-06-02 22:29:59
I don't think that's a certainty.  If inflato-coin were to be launched tomorrow, Bitcoin would have the tremendous advantage of an existing infrastructure, but beyond that I'm not sure if deflato-coin would win against inflato-coin.
Suppose I were to visit a website that offered both inflato-coin and deflato-coin as payment methods. Due to the expectation that deflato-coin can only rise in value, I would be more tempted to spend my inflato-coins, hence making these the preferred method of payment.  Over time, websites may ditch deflato-coin support altogether, since nobody is actually spending them and it's not worth the administrative cost.  Moreover, since there would be more demand for inflato-coins, they could even end up being worth more than deflato-coins!
@_date: 2011-06-03 14:58:25
What is holding it up is that other potential safe harbours are not in better shape.  There's a fair amount of uncertainty around the EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.  In comparison, the USD does not seem so bad.

But the current fiat systems are neither decentralised nor they have a guaranteed inflation rate.  Note that I'm not making a comparison between Bitcoin and current fiat systems.  My question concerns deflato-Bitcoin versus inflato-Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-05-28 15:22:02
Though I think it may still be early to know for sure, I tend to share your fears.  Because the expectation is that the price will continue to increase indefinitely, people may indeed be hoarding their coins instead of spending them to kick start a real economy.
I understand the deflationista argument that this behaviour is eventually self-limiting, because failure to give rise to an actual economy will cause the price of bitcoins to fall and hence encourage spending.  However, I'm still not convinced that these bubble-and-burst cycles will necessarily become smaller until there is convergence to a fairly stable price (which would then *very* slowly rise with deflation).

I agree that it would be refreshing to see a mainstream publication such as the Economist go deeper into the technical aspects of Bitcoin.  If you always treat your audience like dummies, they're bound to remain dummies all their life...  However, in general the article was accurate and fair.  Bitcoin is a great technical innovation, but its ecosystem is still in its infancy.  We can't really argue with that, can we?  Moreover, some of the fundamentals of Bitcoin (namely the 21 million cap) have dubious economic underpinnings.  I know many Bitcoiners disagree with this latter point, but like it or not, it is the mainstream consensus.

I don't think "parity" means what you think it means.  You can't really talk of parity between one commodity measured in mass (silver) with one that is purely ethereal (Bitcoin).  *Unless* you qualify your statement by explicitly specifying what quantity of silver you are talking about.

* "1 Bitcoin is worth more than silver": meaningless.

I don't think you understood the OP's point.  The problem he's concerned about is not one of divisibility, but the inherent deflation associated with Bitcoin.
Divisibility is not really an issue with a digital currency (yes, there are some people who fail to grasp this, but I don't think the OP falls into this category).  However, a deflationary currency may indeed be problematic.
@_date: 2011-06-03 10:15:51
I tend to agree.  Moreover, this psychological barrier to actually spend those Bitcoins may actually undermine one of its great selling points: being a currency of the Internet and for the Internet.

There is one good reason for proposing an AsicBoost fix before Segwit: there would be no reason for miners to oppose it unless they really were using AsicBoost covertly. It would be a way to expose their bullshit, because right now they can hide behind a facade of refusing Segwit for other reasons.

That's a false analogy because given our present knowledge the two events have vastly different probabilities.  Though the probability of a solar flare frying a significant part of our electronics is relatively low, it is nonetheless something quantifiable and far enough from zero to be a valid concern.

This. I tend to think the market will sort things out and I own a fair number of 
Litecoins as a hedge just in case it picks off.  But a conversation this weekend 
made me rethink my assumptions.  I was telling some friends about Bitcoin, and they
were very interested in the concept, even if they had the usual misconceptions.
Then I also told them about Litecoins, and though I was also enthusiastic, I could
see their mood change.  As soon as you bring more than one crypto-currency into the
picture, then people get more skeptical, not less.  Anyway, I realise also investing
in Litecoin was a mistake.  I'll sell the ones I own, and in the future I'll refrain
from even mentioning alternative crypto-currencies when explaining Bitcoin to friends.
