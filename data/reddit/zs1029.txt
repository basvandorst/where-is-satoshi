Bitcoin is not for casual use right now. But it is an option other than banks to wire money across the world.

I don’t really understand the intention of POS. Does POS try to eliminate the hardware competition in POW? 
To my understanding, cryptocurrencies are invented to serve as a medium for transactions without borders. So they should be in circulation 
around the world. I don’t see the reason of holding a large amount of them in one’s wallet will benefit the system.
Maybe I misunderstand it. Some one please correct me if I’m wrong.

That also possible. I'm not familiar with the procedure in the US. They have to prove that he "knew" it in advance. However, they might not have strong evidence of that. You might be right, the arrest may draw media and public attention to spear FUD. The real case itself might just be dismissed afterward if the story was not true. Like the case of Prof. Xiaoxing Xi at Temple University

Long story short:
“According to those same records, in Southern California, between December 30, 2016 and January 8, 2017, Rockcoons allegedly exchanged around 10 bitcoin (worth around $9,200, at the time) for $14,500 in cash with an undercover law officer. That officer allegedly told Rockcoons in advance that the cash came from the manufacture and distribution of “hash oil,” which contains tetrahydrocannabinol, a controlled substance at the federal level.
Money laundering happens when a person takes ill-gotten money and turns it into “clean” money that cannot easily be tracked back to its source. Thus, if Rockcoons knew the cash was dirty, but traded it for bitcoin anyway, that would constitute money laundering.”
He was arrested because he made the deal even he knew the money had problem. Like if you buy stolen stuffs, you will go to jail in most countries .
