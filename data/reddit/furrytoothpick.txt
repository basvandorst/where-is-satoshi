For merchants, yes. However, for consumers it is beneficial to have to authorize each month. Have you never signed up for something only to realize several months down the road that you forgot to unregister?

Damn that's a lot of effort for scamming people.

dot bit predicts the next difficulty will be 181xxxx

I corrected a mistake I made in the price, it actually is intermittent between 0.109 and 0.089 during 12 hours and 0.0059 the other 12 hours and on weekends. I'm with Hydro One as well, but I get time of usage pricing. They may have not implemented it where you're at yet.

At the rate that the difficulty is increasing, will even the high Mhash/$ cards be relatively worthless in the near future?
@_date: 2011-09-14 16:34:56
actually the difficulty is increasing next.

Just found a guy on kijiji selling a 5850 for $100. Hopefully he still has it!

I'm a student and spent 95% of my student loan on buying in at $35 and $45 to purchase an Avalon miner.

Considering that I spent all of the BTC on the Avalon, never had the chance to. Although I highly expected it was a bubble and even said in the mIRC channel 2 days before the crash: "Watch out for a crash in 1-2 days, cash out now". I was just following that chart that always gets posted here, the one with media attention, hype, bear trap, fear, collapse, etc. It seemed to fit pretty well at the peak.

Only about 18 litecoin, I make that in 2.5 days. Crazy to think how just having my computer crunching numbers can buy a raspberry Pi in such a short period of time. 
Last time I checked (1-2 years ago) these things were in high demand and hard to get. I might have to jump on this one. If anything, for the bitcoin price display. 
I'm hoping it has low power consumption.

Those recurring payments are exactly what scare me about signing up for these things in the first place

That's awesome. Love the clear case. It sounds like there are many uses for this little thing. I'm definitely going to have to pick one up. I did go the ASIC route for bitcoin, I purchased a batch 3 Avalon. I was planning on using it with a first gen atom HP netbook, but if I get my hands on one of these before, it would save even more power I'm guessing.
