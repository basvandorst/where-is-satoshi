@_date: 2017-12-01 15:30:28
yea so he gets what he is paid in USD with bitcoin.. if he gets 0.01 bitcoin with a value of 10k = 1 bitcoin he might get less or more depending on if bitcoin is higher or not in another words he does not get the same bitcoin every fortnight.

funny because if I asked you or any 90% of you, you wouldn't be able to tell me what bitcoin is LOL the only thing you could say is
"MONEY" lol tech will always win 
Ive been in and out of bitcoin since 2200 earlier this year. I don't like it because why should I hold a slow high fee coin when I can buy a cheap coin that doesn't need much to increase in value and also pay me dividends via staking? or yeah 90% of you didn't know that some coins offer staking aka dividends for holding that coin.. but carry on with your bullshit that your friends and family told you to buy make sure to follow them when they jump off the bridge cause they lost it all. There are a lot of difference between a pump and dump coin and a actual coin for example EOS is a coin that is a scam, has 1 year long ICO. Omisego rejected 250million dollars from ICO and only allowed 19 million.. A bitcoiner would never know about information like this because most likey they don't even know other coins exist 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:53:28
well unlike you ive been it before the sheep arrived (you) you dont even know why you are investing in this because like you and most people like you, you sheep came in lots for money not knowing why bitcoin? why not the other 1000 coins? because you probably have no clue how to buy them. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:24:59
No thats smart money.. If i bought bitcoin im sure as hell going to have it on a exchange to gtfo when shit goes down.. if i leave it in the wallet brb 15 hours later still pending 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:38
Took out a mortgage on a coin with no technology behind it.. you people are really sheeps
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:44:09
could of said the same about eth when it was a 10 dollar nobody.
If it had the best devs than you wouldn't have 4 forks and another 7 coming before January. 11 FORKS = best devs aye?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:03:14
wtf lol 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:35:24
no..those are from popular people like Roger and the first kinda of it. The others are idiots making them up with no tech or team behind it. Check bitcoin diamond market cap
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:34:41
When I invested in bitcoin 5 years ago i made sure i knew as much as i could. It became a hobby to read about cypto and even more fun investing in it. I now have 2 other coins added, one of them with actual real life use. My point is if you cant even fucken do research on what your investing than you are considered an idiot and therefore tagged as "dumb money" a wallet is literally the basics of crypto investing.. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:08:26
whos ver lol?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:24:07

@_date: 2017-12-02 12:06:01

Twas the night before Christmas and all through the city
 Not a creature was stirring ‘cept one crypto kitty
My stocking was hung by the chimney with care
 In hopes that a Trezor soon would be there
Investors were nestled all snug in their beds
 While visions of Lambos danced in their heads.
With price fluctuations on coin market cap
 I had struggled with FOMO and FUD and such crap
When out on the web there arose such a clatter
 I sprang to my desk to see what was the matter.
I double clicked Chrome with default startup pages
 Of Bad Crypto, the Twitter and fifteen exchanges
The charts indicated a newly formed pop
 And it looked like we’d bounce from that 30 point drop
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
 But a tweet in the ether from someone so dear.
With an image attachment and facial blurred mostly
 I knew right away that it must be Satoshi
Now Litecoin, Now Ether, Iota and Dash
 On Neo and Gas, even you poor Bcash.
From the dark web exchanges, Coinbase and GDAX
 To the IRS lawsuits subpoenas and tax.
From Papa John’s pizza all the way to the moon
 You all will be riding the rocket ship soon.
You thought me all dead but I’ve played arbitrage
 I now have three Lambos in my eight car garage.
So listen up closely, I bring you a toast
 With advice what to do that will earn you the most.
And I heard him exclaim as he turned up a bottle
 Merry Crypto to all and to all you must HODL!"

LMAO.. jesus.. dumb money is really flying in
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:08:08
lets be serious here for a second.. bitcoins tech is absolutely garbage.. compare to other coins that are changing the way we use exchanges *decentralized*, payment systems, staking and receiving passive income etc etc btc has nothing to offer other than what every single coin can already do which is send crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:35:45
Yes there is to some degree.. There is 250 million (maybe more) of funds that are in exchanges and the users have been inactive for some years now
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:14:12
YES you just lost 50 dollars of your pay in 1 hit
YES it took him over a day to send it to you
YESSSSSSSSSS its dropped 2k again (maybe)
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS he thinks you're a moron
So say you get paid bitcoin, your boss doesn't care about price to him its all the same.. He pays you bitcoin at a rate of 11500 and you see it drop down to 8000s like we saw a few days ago... YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
Working for free YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

America does not equal crypto so therefore you all can take your tax questions and debt to a place where people give a shit, you don't see anyone else bitching about their country's regulation, tax, debt, future.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:43:39
this is about to sound shocking to you but instead of being a sheep how about you open your eyes and look at other coins that have literally the fee's of CENTS 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:34:02
really? go buy more useless bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:06:15

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:29:29
I think 99% don't even know what they are buying, as soon something starts rising it appears on their radar and then they jump in
Yes of course
but people irrational in this market
there are no valuations, no understanding.. nothing, just: "Buy the rumour sell the news.."
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:02:43
38.5% market influence it's done lol team to buy omisego for staking

Anyone with half a brain can see that the "segwit2x" upcoming fork is a complete scam. I'm not talking Roger Ver level scam, I mean pure likely-to-go-to-jail scam.
3 guys, with no crypto background, new github account fake profiles and a lot of marketing power have either managed to bribe or fool crypto media e.g.
and many [others](
Simply looking at their linked-in profiles should be enough. This has NOTHING to do with the Jeff Garzik crusade to reinvent bitcoin with no replay protection.
The brilliance is that they claim massive support by pointing to outdated exchange and other posts referring the since abandoned segwit2x fork.
See below for some additional analysis on why this is obviously a boiler room operation.
Meanwhile Coinbase has seen a mass exodus of BTC
Due to high volume, we are experiencing a backlog of outgoing transactions for BTC and ETH.
Remember that the same thing happened with Bitcoin Cash late July, 2017. So What? Bitcoin did fine afterwards right?
This and the other dozen brazen attempts to mislead and co-opt "bitcoin" is causing traffic, temporarily driving up the bitcoin price and will probably attract some seedy miners, exchanges or other legitimate bitcoin resources.
Uninformed will lose money, resources will be siphoned, media will jump on the hype and the stench will affect all of us. This is making Roger Ver and Bcash smell like perfume! We have gotten to a new low akin to shifting from military conflict to terrorism.
Please add constructive comments and do your best to warn people and consider that, although unjustified, this kind of scam will affect everyone in the crypto space.
  
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:02:38
what price range did you buy the dip?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:20:30
yeah and it also defeats the whole purpose of crypto

read about Tether, the long bull run of BTC has been suspicious. The theory is: (and it makes sense) bitfinex created a problem with wells fargo bank and lost it's support, an exchange without a banking systems just can't survive, so in order to survive it had to keep people interested in their exchange, so they create Tether out of thin air everytime BTC starts to fall, and buy huge amounts of BTC shooting the price back up, people keep interested in them because btc is always raising, this has been going on for the past 7 months, since they ended the wells fargo deal, they still haven't got a new bank to back them up.
