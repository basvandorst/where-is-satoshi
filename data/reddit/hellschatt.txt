Uhh, no. I love it, it's easy to use and money transfer took them never longer than 12 hours after my bank approved the transaction.
SEPA is amazing with coinbase.

You mean you're rather unfortunate to experience it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:11:58
Yeah I got out at 11k EUR. That shits too scary.

Yeah it's that easy actually. But just think about all the limits and the fees you're paying. If I knew someone from Korea I'd have done it too.
Buying bitcoin here and getting it to the korean exchange shouldn't be a problem. But the bigger problem is exchanging the korean won for usd and getting it back to you. There are some limits and fees in there. But it should still be profitable.

Well if you know someone from Korea... that's no problem.

Yeaah we're talking about now, 3 weeks is not important for the initial discussion.

Since the fork is tomorrow I'd say you just look up how the price changes during the next 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:27:18
Damn your right. Didn't know that. Oops.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:00:17
Bitcoin gold. In around 19 hours.

Uhh fork incoming tomorrow? It will drop even lower.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:28:48
Sorry I was wrong. The fork happened a while ago apparently, but the mainnet will launch tomorrow.
Not so sure how that would affect the price.

Look... you don't buy when it's green, you buy when it's red.
When green then sell. When red then buy.
Also you don't buy when that shit is going up steeper than a pyramid. Because it's green and everyone is selling then... and you're buying it off from them.
But you're probably good, it'll very likely go higher again.

I needed this.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:43:03
Like if that happens the whole economy would break.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:59:22
Wtf is happening?
