The best thing about the hardware wallet that your missing is that your private key is generated completely offline! And it is never EVER online. Problem with other wallets digital and or paper is that you generate the key on a computer and if it compromised bye bye bitcoin. 
With hardware wallet your keys never go on a PC, so they are never accessible to an online attacker. As for the 24 words I would recommend keeping a copy in a safe in your home and in a safe deposit box at a credit union (fuck banks). 
In the event that someone steals your safe from your house, or the bank tries to seize your box, transfer your coins to a new wallet. 
With the new CPU meltdown vulnerability, all digital wallets are vulnerable to get their keys stolen, hardware wallets are not tho as the key is stored in a separate physical hardware enclave much like apples Face ID/touch id stuff is.

I think the 11-15% of users are the real bitcoin users today then, the people truly using every aspect of the technology, not just a holder or trader. If you believe in the tech you should be using segwit. I use it on my ledger, need to switch to exchange that fully supports it myself tho 
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:07:59
Was friend of a friend and.m neither of us wanted to setup the ach transaction which takes a few days to setup and a few days to transfer, but yeh should have just done bitcoin or done the bank transfer I guess seems stupid in this day and age to have to go through all that

It’s also still usable for transactions. You ever request payment with PayPal? they take 3%.  Buddy owed me 500 and I got 485, 15$. Bitcoin can be cheaper then that depending on the amount/network etc. so it’s still useful for transactions as much as PayPal is at least. Not so much for micro/nano at the moment

You don’t ever have to close a channel. You can keep it open. Plus I won’t need to open a channel with someone if I have a channel with someone else that has one with them.
Say you shop at Walmart and have a channel with them. I don’t already have a channel with walmart but I have one with you. So I can use LN and pay through you to Walmart. Now expand that out, I wont need to have a channel with everyone infact I may not need to open very many at all.

I would guess most transactions are from exchanges which don’t support it. More people got into it with three exchanges at an explosive rate and are probably using their shit wallets as well as have no idea about segwit.  The majority of users are probably new non tech, holders, but what dói know Morty 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:52:22
Yeh, check the git bro, if you know what that means

And to be clear you don’t have to invest in the ICO you can just get and run the nodes the ICO is to help fund the project and give an opportunity to get in early on the PoS mining. The bitbox coin can also be used by other projects to pay people to run their nodes via smart contract, so also creating an ecosystem for devs to get their projects rolling 
We’ll be making our store available soon and you’ll be able to purchase a bitbox then

Just updated my bitbox bitcoin and litecoin nodes, making a platform that should help make running/managing nodes a lot easier check it out and subscribe we could use some feedback and testers  
Need to make the full node process easy mode for everyone including updates 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:51:26
It’s not in the graphic interface but if you run bitcoind from the command line it is there, you can do a lot more with the command line it than the graphical interface bitcoin-at is what they are saying. They mention too that Core wallet is for more technical users and if you are not very technical you should probably use a different wallet for your own security. Bitcoin core devs built segwit out so everyone can use it and only put it in their command line as not many users use the Core wallet it’s more important for the developers of the Core platform to focus on bigger improvements to the whole network then it is add a shiny interface for non tech users on a tech wallet. Bitcore Core wallet is also a full node meaning your downloading the whole block chain and actively relaying transactions.
To be clear, the Core wallet you’re thinking of is just a limited front end to the bitcoind client. No wallet would be able to use segwit if bitcoind did not support it already

Like I said RTFM mang, it’s still very much in dev 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:41:23
Bitcoin is like goku, no matter how much he gets beat or even killed he comes back stronger, most of the time he’s holding back too
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:33:54
You actually don’t have to open another channel to put funds on there if you have an existing one, I think that’s a recent update. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:09:32
You should read more on LN the transactions don’t hit the nodes unless they are contested. They are literally done off chain instantly between peers. Rtfm 
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:45:28
Making it easy is step 1, step 2 is incentivizing people to run nodes. There is a cost hardware, electricity, bandwidth that you have to pay to run nodes. That’s where we saw a good opportunity to create a PoS blockchain so you can PoS mine with bitbox as well as support the networks you want. You’ll also be able to PoS mine other PoS coins as well. What’s your fit repo for your project?

Anyone looking to do this safely just move your BTC to a new wallet so your BTC wallet will have a 0 bal, then use a legit wallet for BTG and in the event that your seed is compromised, who cares 0 balance on it. I would only use the btg Core wallet cause if that doesn’t work then why would any other bet wallet

We’re making bitbox a hardware device that runs all nodes you want with easy 1 click installs. I actually used my prototype to buy some stickers on LN.
We are also working on providing incentive to run a one via PoS blockchain. Our price point is lower than Casa node and the hardware is much better, capable of running many nodes, have 6 going no problem. We also are making a dev kit so people can easily create app packages to run other full nodes.
@_date: 2019-08-16 03:59:56
Super cool man! I make them and sell them! More nodes out there the better.old PCs are great, raspberry pi is great and cheap for 1 node like bitcoin and if you wanna do more than 1 like btc and LTC or more odroid makes really good boards that don’t cost that much more than a pi and can run lots of chains

I used the economic option on a bread wallet transaction ~20$ US. I didn’t want to do a 5$ fee for moving 20$. Waiting for it to get picked up, not in a hurry, but thinking that it will never go through now :/ 
I agree with Core and NO2X, need to get all the wallets on segwit and layer2 quick, as is BTC sucks for transactions. Block size increase only postpones the fee problem and leads to poor centralization 
I wanted to get a friend into it few days ago, but when I looked st the cost of moving 5$ ($7) just said forget it.
Are you sure this isn’t just people trying to avoid outrageous fees,  like me?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:31:32
Still a work in progress but got it running with testnet, those are testnet wallets so don’t bother trying to get the keys .
Currently supports LTC,BTC
Built using a raspberry pi, still need to integrate the cash accepter 
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:33:46
Getbitbox.io check it out we do all full nodes and lightning network too! Not using a pi we needed better hardware to support running many full nodes

Actually we have a full working product now :D we did work first!  
We saw two issues we wanted to solve for running full nodes: Usability and incentivizing people to run nodes. We've got the first part done, simply easy to use interface that lets you run all the full nodes you want. The ICO will help us solve the second part--the goal is to create a PoS coin that bitbox owners can easily stake. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:33:51
Been working hard on this for a while check our Twitter to see our progression: 
I appreciate your vigilance as there are lots of scams in this space but we’re a small team working on something we believe in. If you’d like to know more about us or the project hit us up we’re very open and based in the US (Idaho)
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:13:14
Shitcoin support? What are you talking about we don't support bitcoin cash! :D 
We currently built out support for the BTC, Lightning BTC (LND node), LTC, ETH, VTC, and DCR; however, our platform will also let 3rd party dev's or the open source community create "full node" packages that bitbox users can easily one-click install. So, I suppose the platform does support "shitcoins" in that it can support any coin. BUT you only run the full nodes you want to run, so its really up to the end user to decide what they'd like to run.
As for the ICO I mentioned above:
"We saw two issues we wanted to solve for running full nodes: Usability and incentivizing people to run nodes. We've got the first part done, simply easy to use interface that lets you run all the full nodes you want. The ICO will help us solve the second part--the goal is to create a PoS coin that bitbox owners can easily stake."

Also they may ship sooner, we honestly just don’t know what the demand will be so we wanted to give our selves some buffer

Haha true that, there’s some moon implications for sajins too

Coworker bought 20$ to learn about it for work, forgot about it, I asked him how much it was worth and he was like how do I check?
It’s 128 now. He bought it maybe 6 months ago. So yeah seems like a great idea 
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:52:23
Yeh I just been buying 20 here 20 there 100 here and seen steady increase in the value. Better return than any savings account 
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:49:57
Haha yeah I tried to buy those, but their node was messed up I ended up in the LND slack channel and ran into this dude selling stickers and magnets quinsolo I think is what his store was called he hooked it up with a bunch more than I ordered
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:34:06
Feel like LN is still beta yeh? At least LND is that’s what I been using for mine and on bitbox ( still need to implement some of the LN features, but was able to use mine to buy some stickers using command line LND
