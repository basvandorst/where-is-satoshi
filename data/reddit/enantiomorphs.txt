a 9k investment into a 350 to 500gighash cloud miner will net you $3300 to $12000 after the 9k is spent. Takes 230 to 170 days to break even at CURRENT difficulty.
Edit: 1k for cloud hashings look to make you about 300 At the year end... sorry, and that is at current difficulty

Yes. That is how a wallet in all respects works.
Paper, digital, it is all going to be on the blockchain ledger. So you can by a little bit of BTC, usually from an exchange, and transfer it into whatever and how ever many wallets you have, paper and digital.

Laziness plus majority of humans seem to believe they are the exception, regardless of how risky the actions. It's kinda like how a lot highschool students bomb there final quarter/semester, they did years and years of work and study and even though there is only a few months left the mind thinks it has done enough.
