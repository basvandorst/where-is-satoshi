Manchester (UK). Spoke with the store owner. I was the first one to ask him about bitcoin since he put up the sign :)

There's a hip hop nightclub right next to the store..  might explain the sale of gold chains/gold teeth..

I went to the store and bought a bottle of vitamin water 
Transferred 0.251 BTC via SMS. (Use a windows phone and there are no apps supporting bitcoin yet)
Had a quick chat with the store owner. This (as expected) was his first sale via bitcoin.
He has out up the poster to raise awareness about bitcoins and was not actually expecting someone to buy anything :)
Told him about this section and thread so he might come around and answer some questions later.

Used the blockchain mobile website. There's an option to send via email/SMS.
Message was received instantaneously. The transaction summary on the website shows 3 confirmations. (Not sure what that means)
