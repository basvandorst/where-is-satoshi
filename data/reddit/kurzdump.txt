It is unbelievable how hostile this debate is. I am deeply disappointed and disgusted.

This might be the reason why syncing the last few weeks of the blockchain takes forever on my newly created full node.
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:18:28
The client crashed several times after changing the parameter.

The current market cap of bitcoin is about 12,3 billion $ - that's nothing in terms of big money. Wealth distribution will change rapidly once the big players start investing in bitcoin. 
Most of the hodlers will get greedy and sell everything (for peanuts). At the end of the transition process the bitcoin wealth distribution will more or less reflect the current wealth distribution.

"Bitcoin core" contains "BCC intro" leaving the letters "IEO" which clearly stand for "in everyones opinon".
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:35:29
That could be because of the fact that of the few people who know Bitcoin, even less know the ticker symbol.

You are paying tax for swapping coins? I'm swapping coins every few hours.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:47:01
RemindMe! 4 hours

Roger Ver is the devil to Bitcoin-Socialists.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:24:32
To be honest, I'm not interested in conspiracy theories and I don't care about Roger Ver and all the other Bitcoin elites. Bitcoin does not need people preaching religion.  
The market will determine its future.

Are you 'most people'?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:32:01
Your arrogant behavior is not a sign of adulthood.

What do you do when swapping coins results in a loss?
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:15:17
The attack took my BU node down successfully. Setting up a new core node (0.14.0) did not help. The core client keeps crashing as well.
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:57:37
My blockchain was corrupted after the attack. The core client crashed while validating the chain (at 7%). It was the same error message​. I guess that the attack was targeted on my IP and not specifically on the bitcoin client as my router crashed for the first time in years as well.

Sell high, buy low. Hodling is pointless in a very dynamic market.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:39:26
On the contrary, everything we do here will never be forgotten for the first time in history. @_date: 2017-05-17 16:39:00
Is centralization of power by implementing hierarchical structures a better idea? 
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:48:11
Why are so many people starving, while it is no problem for me to eat whatever I want? Food costs almost nothing. Weird.

The consciousness of the future will not have to be synchronized with slow movements of inertial bodies. The experience of time will change fundamentally.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:52:47
Bitcoin has become dysfunctional. Limit breached.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:59:28
Hierarchical structures mean hierarchical power and this would make Bitcoin lose its most important feature.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:30:34
Yes, but it is foolish to force a change of direction in technology, while artificial limits destroy the productive system.   
I have sold most of my bitcoins today, because in my opinion a centralization (of power, not mining-infrastructure) will not be preventable under current circumstances.

He spammed the blockchain with bible verses and he is a political activist.  
Besides, this is not an attack, but a relativization of your praise.
Luke Dash jr. : "The only religion people have a right to practice is Catholicism. Other religions should not exist. Nobody has any right to practice false religions. Martin Luther was a servant of Satan. He ought to have been put to death. Slavery is not immoral. Sodomy should be punishable by death." 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:24:21
How can you know that all those stucked transactions are just useless spam? Does the number of meaningful transactions waiting for confirmation mean anything to you?
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:03:50
Why should anyone want to hold small amounts of Bitcoin when fees will eventually climb to several 100 $?
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:44:29
The classic blockchain technology is still far from its limits, and it does not make sense to solve problems that do not exist today or will never exist.   
Problems of the future are solved in the future, because only then we know the details about the problems and the technology that will be available then.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:39:58
The man is an extremist in every respect. You should be afraid of such people.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:18:11
Ideologists often confuse opposing opinions with stupidity. This applies to both of you.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:55:30
No. There are about 4 tx/sec on average. Bitcoin cannot process them, regardless of the fee.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:04:11
Well, then Bitcoin is not money, it is a digital asset.
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:53:54
Why would someone play coins with all his life savings. That would be insane.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:35:31
Money is based on communication. If you limit the communication (to be able to implement a communication market), you limit the complexity of the system. This is a very bad idea unless you want to use it in a static environment.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:56:17
If there are 4-5 transactions per second but bitcoin can process only 3-4, then there will ALWAYS be transactions that are priced out. It does not matter how high the fees rise. At some point, it will be impossible for addresses with small amounts to move the amounts.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:40:56
Anyone who follows a crazy ideology is crazy.
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:30:50
Then what is the purpose of buying and hodling Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:06:44
If everyone payed a high fee, how could bitcoin process 4 tx/sec on average?
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:57:36
Segwit does not solve this problem.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:05:50
Keep in mind to never stake everything on one card. No one knows at the moment how the race will end.
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:02:37
Don't panic. Don't sell. Your loss would be the profit of someone else.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:50:22
No, thank you. I've just sold my 5.7 BTC for 2732 USD/BTC. Farewell.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:03:56
They would rather let themselves be buried alive than accept any compromises.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:31:09
Your comment suggests that Core developers are the rulers of Bitcoin.   
I thought it was decentralized.
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:07:09
Bitcoin needs a centralized team to prevent centralization? That is ridiculous, isn't it? If the system converges towards centralization, then it has some serious design-flaws.    
I think I should get rid of my Bitcoins as quickly as possible.
