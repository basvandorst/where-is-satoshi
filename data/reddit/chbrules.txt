We already have private security. You can go and hire a private firm right now from everything from a night watchman, to an alarm company, to a bodyguard. Why is this some big shocker to you? We have private military too. We've used private mercenaries throughout our entire country's history in every war.

And how do you propose going about separating private interests and government? Not even totalitarian states could achieve that.

I think you should read a bit what Plato had to say on Democracy.
"Tyranny of the minority, by the majority."

Why exactly would it be difficult to commercialize policework? What exactly is it that they do that's so specialized/difficult? Are we talking about private forensics labs that police forces often use right now? Or maybe the ability to work with other private entities to request documents for investigative purposes that they readily supply willingly as it is?
Don't underestimate the ingenuity of humans. We've done a lot with a little, and we can do a whole lot more.
Here is one proposed solution:

But you end up at the same problem. How do you enforce such things? Force. It is still monopolization of force and coercion on your life. There is little accountability, and it's nothing that private firms couldn't handle anyway.

More people should simply oppose the system and walk away. The concept of an income tax is absurd when you break it down. The government (especially IRS) have such limited resources it's funny. They like to sound far scarier and bigger than they really are.

It is in the interest of both parties to settle disputes civilly. Not only for your own reputation, but potential losses of business from other parties and from consumers. Many companies have arbitration agreements. You are under a number of those already, I guarantee it. This is nothing new.

Libertarianism central planning is an oxymoron. Libertarianism cannot be complete in a statist society. Libertarianism requires an anarchal society to function fully. It's a shame that the word has been hijacked by GOP reject fundies. They, generally, have no concept of economics or the first thing of Libertarian/Anarchistic philosophy.
And I disagree wholly that we don't have the technology and resources to privatize everything government does right now. Where do you think government derives its abilities from? Magic land?

Nice post, and thank you for the time to write this all out. There is a lot of interesting information here on the topic of taxing Bitcoins. Knowing lawyers, you guys have some sadistic love affair with writing and reading page after page of words. You probably enjoyed writing all this. ;]
However, none of this really matters at the end of the day. Bitcoins, by definition, were created to circumvent government entirely. Yes, we could go on about truly being able to be anonymous with Bitcoin, but in general, if so many people are doing it, it will become ridiculous difficult to try to trace most people who would use the service to dodge taxes. It wouldn't be economically feasible to try with anyone other than the largest offenders. This is assuming that the Bitcoin development community and competitors don't take it a step further to secure anonymity further than it already is.

Just like piracy is illegal?

OMG THEIR THING IS DOING WHAT THEY SAID IT WOULD!

Not an argument.

That sweet, sweet self organization.

Yeah, you tell em! Pffttt...

lol why not 10000000000x?

His greater point that bitcoin is gambling right now is spot on. Most bitcoin traffic right now is market trading. People are investing to invest and get money from it.
Does bitcoin have potential future utility? Yeah, I think it'll be used as a legit currency. Do I think that the valuation of it growing against other fiat currencies is going to last? Hell no.
As Peter said, you understand this is a bubble right now, invest wisely.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:40:09
So you're filling out some retarded online petition that is incredibly meaningless for a company that nets many millions to bet on bitcoin not going down here shortly. Right.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:48:48
I hear they're thinking about making piracy illegal too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:33:06
Yeah, except the whole exchange rate thing fluctuates like a mother fucker 24/7.

Pretty sure this isn't what was said, and even further is just standard leftist dribble. Those that lack understanding of business and finance would say something like that.
The "15% margins" claimed on their site don't mean anything. The value they receive from selling their crop is what is important. They would get 0% otherwise if they couldn't rely on "bankers, globalists, and greedy corporations" to perform the logistics of getting the product to you.

lol this is how all markets work. Welcome to the real world. Think you'd find more logic in a stock market? Good luck.

I have no BTC. I was going to buy in an initial amount. I will see what contacting support might do.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:44:11
ZOMG EVERYONE SHOULD ACCEPT BITCOIN!

Tried at $660, but I put a stop order in at my bank. Fuck that.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:55:28
I put a stop pay in with my bank because their order cancellation system was crap. By the time their support contacted me they just said it was too late and left it at that.

Mistaking corrections with popping bubbles is funny.

Really? Two people are moving the actual product all around the world and delivering it right to your doorstep? I'd love to hear more...
