And the usage of bitcoins won't have made any difference whatsoever.

There was NO implicit guarantee of a bail out before the crash. That was his whole point. That implicit guarantee only came about after the bailout because the bail out itself showed that the government will step in for future instances. Before the crash and before the bailout, that moral hazard didn't exist. 
The government won't have let bear sterns fail if they were implicitly guaranteeing anything. Bear sterns failed because up till the day it actually did and crashed the whole system, the government saw the scenario as acceptable. Not remotely a good thing, but acceptable and thus allowed to happen. 
Bitcoin has nothing to do with the issue and won't have prevented anything. Bitcoin might help limit moral hazard by limiting the ability of governments to bailout banks, but moral hazard is a legacy of the crash, not the cause. It only comes into the picture after the government reversed their initial stance pre bear sterns and started actually bailing out institution.

Just because someone is willing to accept some risk doesn't mean they will be willing to accept more on top of what they are already shouldering . 
Did you really need this pointed out?

Too bad you can't grasp when basic math is relevant and when it's not. Physical currency is not a for profit product. Whether the cost to make is larger than the stated value on the money is irrelevant. It might be nice for the government if it's higher, but it's hardly the point. 
Going by your reasoning, why would the government print or mint anything other than the largest possible denominations? 
It's there to facilitate transfers of value. You judge it's worth by comparing it's cost to make against the total value it can facilitate the transfer of during its lifetime &amp;  it's effectiveness in doing it, not it's nominal value. 
Stop being an idiot.

Jesus this article is such trash. 
Oh really? Bitcoin is a better investment than the lottery? No shit. 
Being a better investment than gambling is not something worth being proud of or making a big deal about. 
Guess what, there are better tickets out of poverty than putting your money in what is still a high risk investment. Just because it's better than the lottery as an investment for the poor doesn't mean it's anywhere close to being a good investment for the poor. Bitcoin isn't for people without sufficient savings and liquidity buffers.

Predict is a pretty grandiose term for what you're doing. I would have categorized it as making shit up.

The regulations are not created with the aim of benefiting startups, or any company it's regulating. It's meant to benefit consumers and society at large. Evaluating it based on what it does to startups is missing the point.

People have been saying this for longer than you've probably been alive

Or...and I'm just gonna throw this idea out there...your understanding of international finance is infantile. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:51:53


Yeah. Because people from Hong Kong exchanging Hong Kong dollars for NZ dollars before going on  trip to NZ is entirely impossible a situation to imagine

It's pretty fucking obvious they wanted the actual paper cash specifically for some use. It's clearly not a simple transfer of funds for a transaction. Likely it has to do  retail banking service needs. 
Not sure if people here are actually this stupid or being intentionally obtuse.

Not everything needs to be digital all the time. This is like saying paper money is dumb because credit cards exist.

Your net worth can go below zero. Debt is a thing. People can lose more than they have when investing. If you want to be pedantic at least try not to be wrong.

If you want to get down to it. Yes. Your right to property is indeed trumped by another's right to life. What's your point? It shouldn't? Your right to have stuff is more important than someone else's right not to die?
