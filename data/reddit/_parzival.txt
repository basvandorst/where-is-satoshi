yeah... i can find one link to two people who've made exchanges and one of them made them exchange to dollars prior to closing the deal.  so they sold their bitcoin to someone speculating on it for dollars and made the deal... if im wrong source me, but this looks like a gimmick.  or a good way to buy drugs.

except no one really uses it, they're buying it with the intent of selling it not exchanging it for goods and products.  for those things they're going to trade it for dollars...

i could only find one link to anyone who'd done it and the seller made them exchange it to dollars... so if you have another source that would be great, otherwise i'm going to assume it was a gimmicky exchange for a real estate firm to get some attention.

Man I think you should really read a book on investing... You don't buy into a stock market that's due for an adjustment and you don't buy dumb shit  like crypto with money you will miss.

Gold is a commodity and bitcoin advertises as a "currency".  Wow dude you can't even tell the difference and you expect people to take your shit seriously?  Truly next level economists on this subreddit

You have drunk the koolaid so hard dude, what are you even talking about.  You know what businesses trust? Money.  What's the point of paying my contractors in bitcoin when I can pay them in cash? Literally none, they can take my cash and deposit it or go spend it immediately.  Around the world people get bye issuing purchase orders backed by the trust in the company.  No one wants to deal with yet another intermediary

Something something "but bitcoin IS regulated currency" LOL.

Why is someone going to manipulate the market again with an artificial spike?
