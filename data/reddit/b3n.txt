You don’t have to have a CVV to process a card.
Edit: Not quite sure about the exp, but I think the same applies. Typically, merchants will pay a lower fee on transactions that include cvv, name, etc as there is less of a risk involved in processing the card.

Oh yeah. Duh! Why else would Visa be hiring blockchain engineers. Lolz

We’re gonna have a problem here.

In a gist, it’s for testing purposes only. It’ll generate’s credit card numbers that pass the Luhn algorithm (link below). Luhn is basically a set of rules to verify that a given “card number” is in valid format and not just a bunch of random numbers. It’s used for developers to create valid numbers to test on their credit card validation code within their software. While I suppose it could create an actual real and active card, the chances are incredibly slim. There wouldn’t be a way to verify that the number is active with visa/mc/amex unless you attempted to charge it.

Hopefully you actually deactivated the card and/or emptied your account, seeing that 75% of the card numbers are in your picture. The missing 2nd block is likely very similar, if not exact, to other bitpay cards.
Edit: Number 2-6 is the same on all bitpay cards, in theory. Apparently that is the bank/institution identifier. Assuming one has a bitpay card, they now have 75% of digits within the second block of numbers. All that is left to figure out is the 8th digit of the card, aka the first digit of the account number.

You render a great deal of security features useless when you jailbreak. Another jailbreak app can grant itself permissions to other apps. Eg: password managers, bitcoin/crypto clients, and your fake calculator app filled with nude pics. Lol
And dear god, please do not leave your root password as “alpine”.
