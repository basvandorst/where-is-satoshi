BC can be broken down into dollars and pennies....you would then have fractions of BC.  Point is to get folks online.  Traditionally unbanked would have improved savings habits and lower transaction cost for bill paying and sending and receiving money

For a quick intro to me

English Bulldog.  I believe there will be a place for digital currency within city services.  I think we have to monitor and make sure volatility concerns are addressed, especially given the already fragile Oakland budget.  That said, I like the BC idea for parking.  We can convert the BC to USD.  Making the parking experience as easy and painless as we can is prudent.  Good suggestion for a pilot.

That is exactly the point.

Hi all.  I the AMA is started.  I am here now.  Thank you for joining
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:13:51
Hi.  Have enjoyed the questions and chance to comment.  AMA will wind down shortly.
Feel free to send any last questions.  I will do another in a week or so and we will also try to partner to raise money for the homeless in Oakland.

Fat Boy.  I hope to earn your vote.  Thank you for the question.  We must have a zero tolerance for these sideshows...they are dangerous.  Moreover, I will be working hard to get the guns off the street.  Partnering with OPD and using programs like ceasefire is one way.  Partnering with organizations, like I have already done, like Gun buy Gun, and doing gun back backs is another.  Long terms we have to offer more education and job opportunities to everyone in the city such that our youth see that there are other choices available to them.

Personally, I will spend my bitcoins in the bitcoin economy with vendors who accept them.  Our home team, the Golden State Warriors, is one of the first to accept them.  I will buy tickets from them with bitcoin as one example.
For the bitcoin who come into the campaign, our partner, Go Coin, converts them to USD.  We have told supporters, like credit cards, that I will turn their money into USD, mainly for currency risk reasons.

I hope you will consider supporting me.  $1, $5, $10 or $25 (up to $100) helps me keep getting my message of change, innovation and support for new ideas and concepts like Bitcoin going.

Thank you.  We will stay open to innovation.  Innovation and new ideas not only help in tech and building tech businesses, but are new ways to educate, budget and provide safety solution.  It is a mindset and strategy.  Technology is a tool of a potential solution.
Thank you for the best wishes we will be working hard to be victorious

This is about innovation and being open to new technologies. Digital currency will be a part of the future of our currency system. To have innovators want to come to Oakland we have to be open minded to innovation.
In terms of security, they are as many or more safeguards than credit cards. Yes there have been some people of bad intent but that happens with any system

Bitswanitz.  Not until we address the volatility of BC.  We already have a $1BN+ underfunded pension issue, mostly due to officials overstating the returns we would get on our investment.  Until we can get our liability and payments under control I do not think it would be prudent to expose us to a potentially bigger loss

My personal bit coin within the economy.  Like with the Warriors, one of the first to accept bitcoin.  I will use my bc with them so that the currency is promoted.
I have pledged to my supporters that I will convert BC to USD through my partner GO coin similar to have we treat credit cards.  Mostly for currency risk reasons.
