But as should be rather obvious at this point, the average consumer is never going to use Bitcoin without some form of Coinbase/gateway type of account.  So, users are always going to be beholden to the stricter rules of the service they are using, not the natural "rules" of bitcoin.

Holy shit. If you've *ever* worked remotely close to fraud related activity in the financial industry you'd know that this is *exactly* what people do.

To anyone paying attention, that was their obvious goal from the beginning.  The entire bitcoin angle was just to ride a wave of hype as an entry point into the market.  Yes, they may continue to deal in Bitcoin when necessary, but the bigger they get, the more they'll be like PayPal and just float everything internally.

PayPal is in 203 countries.  That's pretty damn global, and has been for a long time.  The countries they don't bother with are either just poverty ridden, incredibly tiny markets, or they are on the banned list by the US govt.  (Something any bitcoin US company has to abide by as well)
As for "stealing people's money"... *Any* US based financial service, whether bitcoin, fiat, or whathaveyou, has to abide by many regulations.  That includes money laundering, cooperating with law enforcement, getting involved in financial disputes, etc, etc.  At no point does PayPal ever just say "hey, I don't like this user, he's a dick, I'm going to steal his money!"  They're just often at the mercy of a 3rd party and don't have any real choice in the matter.

They still spent money (the computer/electricity) to acquire the coins.  People aren't mining for the good of bitcoin, they mine to turn a profit.

The problem is, many people *are* putting up money they don't want to lose on bitcoin.  That much is obvious every time there is a big drop and people start moaning.  And unfortunately, communities like this one constantly encourage it.  
No, nobody is really saying "put everything you have into bitcoin!"  But you also don't hear many people around here say "you should probably have more than 2-3% of your portfolio it bitcoin right now, maybe 5% if you are a gambler".  There's an awful lot of pump and dump going on in the bitcoin world, and certainly a lot more of that than there is rational investment decisions.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:08:14
But again, unless you can reverse a charge, bitcoin on a credit card is bad for consumers.  If it ever moves to a crypto instead of fiat, it *has* to be a reversible protocol.  
Otherwise, you'd be a fool as a consumer to use a credit card that stripped away your chargeback abilities, and thus the market will never get going for the bitcoin credit card.

If your average merchant doesn't provide cash discounts, they're not going to provide bitcoin discounts any time soon.  Things like eGifter are not cashback programs, it's a marketing initiative that is playing in the spread between the amount of money spent buying gift cards and the amount of money that actually get used on gift cards.  i.e. gift cards are hugely profitable for merchants, so they have no problem selling them at a discount if done so in an inconvenient manner.  (such as not directly at point of sale, and jumping through 3rd party hoops like egifter)
Credit card cashbacks are a necessary evil used to convince a customer to use one credit card vs another.  Nobody involved besides the consumer actually *likes* that they exist.
The only people who are ever going to have any interest in providing a bitcoin discount are either those with the desire and incentive to see bitcoin succeed, or those willing to sacrifice marketing dollars in the form of a bitcoin cashback to emotionally appeal to bitcoin holders.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:03:39
Partially, but as a consumer, I genuinely don't care. 
For one, almost no merchants offer cash discounts, and they don't offer ACH discounts (which costs pennies), so it's not like they're going to magically decide to offer bitcoin discounts. 
For two, my real "extra" cost after cash back is usually a percent or so. Why would you not happily pay 1% to get extended warranty and screw job protections on everything you buy?  It's not worth $20 on a $2000 tv to you?
I feel like there is a severe consumer misunderstanding about the credit card industry around here. It puzzles me why anyone would prefer bitcoin over a credit card right now.

It's completely dependent on your processor relationship, but if you're getting anything more than 3 days as a merchant, you're either a small account or you need to negotiate better. Coinbase should have no problem getting 3 days on the clawback.

Coinbase is trying to start a business, the last thing they have time and resources for is lobbying.  
Not to mention, they're not going to get anywhere.  These are anti-terrorism laws, which will heavily trump the needs of bitcoin users.

The point of Tor is to do things you don't want to be easily traced back to you.  i.e. to hide from your ISP, the government, the site you are visiting, etc.  The entire reason that works is it routes all your data through many other people's computers.  This makes you super vulnerable to certain types of hacks that can access whatever you are sending through the network, thus you need to be careful.  
Tor is *not* supposed to be for private/personal things you would really not want anyone else to have access to.   
The only truly *safe* way to buy bitcoin is through a legitimate seller authorized/approved by your country of residence.  Anything else is going to incur some risk.

Sure, but that's a solved problem. If a user frequently charges small amounts, like you said, you just batch them together. And it's not about the $10 charge, it's about the average ticket size, which will be much larger for most forms of e-commerce. 
Also at that kind of scale you can get costs down even more.

Problems using $100 bills in the US are quite rare.  The only issues you're really going to run into are stores that are high targets for counterfeit purchases (like liquor stores).  But even then, they'll typically just mark it and/or inspect it a bit then run the purchase through just fine.

It's not only easy, but you get a lot of consumer protection and benefits when you buy something with a credit card. There's no extended warranties or chargebacks with bitcoin. Cash back or bonus points accrue on most cards as well. 
Even if bitcoin took over the world, you should still pay with a credit card whenever possible. Just pay off your balance every month to never pay interest.

I didn't say it wasn't practical, but practicality has little to do with it.  My credit card is about as practical as it gets.  
When a new product comes out, to get consumers to switch, it has to offer compelling benefits beyond the existing product.  Bitcoin not only doesn't offer the average consumer a compelling benefit over a credit card, it actually falls short.  (no reversals, no chargebacks, no cash back, no free 30 day float, no line of credit, and a lot of volatility)
Now, could somebody do all of that with a bitcoin credit card instead of a fiat based credit card?  Sure.  But they haven't, and banks have no incentive.  Until that happens, bitcoin is not going to catch on with the average consumer.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:28:49
One very important note that he misses when talking about high credit card processing rates...
Those rates exist for a reason (well, a couple of them) in certain industries/services.  One, a high volume of chargebacks, and two, a high risk of the merchant going out of business.  (Also a three, you've been caught doing shady business practices and normal processors don't want you)  In other words, a service paying 10% in credit card fees is *precisely* the kind of service that consumers tend to have issues with.
As a consumer, you actually *want* to use a credit card on these types of sites to protect you in case your goods/services do not get delivered as promised.  You wouldn't want to pay with bitcoins unless you had to, because if you pay and the company screws you, you're shit out of luck.  
Now, in theory they might drop prices by 10% for people paying with bitcoins, and that may be enough of a discount to convince people to take the risk.  But in reality, we all know most sites are just going to enjoy the extra profits.
Point being - reduction in credit card fees seems great on the surface (and it is wonderful for merchants), but it's not so clear cut for consumers.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:23:46

Not necessarily. More people than normal could be buying but if even more people are selling then the price will drop. Which is likely what is happening as many people probably set $500 as their exit. It's a meaningless number, but psychologically it's an important milestone marker for many as it represents a nice round number. 
It's common for markets to see abnormal behaviors near milestone numbers.

You guys should really consider taking security more seriously.  The bigger coinbase/bitcoin grows, the more and more you're going to be under attack.  Decisions that you make *now* will have vital ramifications towards the future security of your service.  And with a service like the one you're trying to build, if you don't have security, you don't have anything.  So while I fully understand the mentality of "we're a small team and can't fix everything as fast as we'd like", all matters of security should automatically be pushed towards the top of the list.

I'm not a fan of shorting anything - the market is way too unpredictable and if I want to gamble, I'll go to a casino.
That said, I would consider shorting bitcoin if I played that game.  A cryptocurrency taking over for a major currency is a pipe dream, and IMO that alone may have bitcoin greatly overvalued.  But, I do believe a cryptocurrency will one day compete sincerely with PayPal et al for online purchases.  However, I do not necessarily believe that cryptocurrency will be bitcoin.  Quite frankly bitcoin hasn't provided a reason to be that success story yet.
The biggest roadblock IMO is the drawbacks of using bitcoin vs a credit card.  With a credit card I seamlessly get cashback bonuses (1-5%), double/triple my warranty and/or things like automatic vacation insurance, the simple ability to chargeback an item if I get into a dispute with a merchant, and I build credit history.  With bitcoin, I give up all of that, for absolutely no benefit. 
The cryptocurrency that wins IMO will be built around the same principals of consumer protection as the credit card industry.  I think it will look more like a decentralized Visa than the decentralized currency that is bitcoin.

I don't know why people keep saying this.  It's not true for cash, and it's not going to be true for bitcoin.  Cash discounts are offered by *maybe* 1% of merchants, and those are usually for very high priced items where the fees are significant (jewelry, electronics, etc).


The only money you should have in a savings account is that which you will need for the short term and/or emergency access.  Everything else should be invested somewhere else.  That is true whether you are in USD, Euro, bitcoin, or anything else.

Long story short, AML compliance is transitive.  Coinbase can't knowingly sell bitcoin to somebody who is going to then turn around and sell those coins to somebody else *without* AML compliance.  
That's pretty much the very definition of money laundering, and it's something every financial institution has to take very seriously.
This guy was likely either buying a large enough amount of coins to trip some flags, or he is outbuying the profile Coinbase has on him.

Succinct and accurate. I really wish it were possible to discuss bitcoin with others in a way that removes bias and emotion.

@_date: 2014-12-17 17:18:36


Not necessarily.  Markets just don't behave neatly like that, nor do they always align with cause and effect.  Consumers and speculators could be correlated as you suggest, or they could be inversely correlated, or they could be completely disjoint.  
Often times consumers are the last people to know about something, and that can signal the right time for speculators to *sell*, not buy.  
For example, bitcoin is about $320 right now.  A lot of people were buying bitcoin at $300 with the anticipation that it would hit $400 again.  If some large consumer purchasing event happens to push the price to $400, all of those $300 cost basis speculators may quickly bail.
As a total aside, at this point there is no news short of "US decides to replace USD with bitcoin" that is going to cause a large consumer spike.  At best, it's going to be a continual slow trickle of growth for years.

Price is irrelevant if you keep selling half after significant rises.  (So sell half at $50, half at $500, half at whatever, etc, etc)  Yes, you're giving up a peak profit, but nobody can time the market ceiling, and this method safely reaps you very strong profits.  And hell, if you bought at $1 and sold at $50 you just made an astronomical return.

Oh boy, I don't even know where to start...


Some guy making $30k a year isn't even worth their TIME.
The IRS does not audit based on your income, they audit based on two things - randomness, and red flags.  The former puts everybody in the same boat, and you have no way of predicting the latter.  Like I said above, unforeseen events, substantial tax changes, windfalls, etc, etc are all things that can trigger audits.
The entire reason why the IRS audits people is not to track down lost money, it's to instill the fear of god into people to pay their taxes accurately.  They only have the resources to audit a small fraction of the population every year, so they'll never recover anything close to what they should.


Yep.  But this is a state income tax issue and the federal level doesn't care.  You also technically owe the offset between your state's sales tax and another state's sales tax if you buy something out of state.  
This is apples and oranges though.  The point of bitcoin regulations is to report capital gains.  It's an investment, and you owe gains on the investments.  The fed *really* cares about cap gains.


Not necessarily, no.  But until that becomes commonplace, that's a surefire way to throw up one of the aforementioned red flags onto your account.  And when you get audited, they will *dig*, and *dig*, and *dig*.  And it will be your responsibility to prove your innocence at every turn, so be prepared.


Nope, wrong.  They're a government agency, not a business.  And the guys "with the big bucks" aren't nearly as fruitful anyway.  If you have money, you usually play by the book, because it's stupid not to.  You hire CPA's, and tax attorneys, and have excellent record keeping.  The rich may be good at exploiting every loophole possible, but those are still legal loopholes.  
But again, as I said above, the IRS is not about reclaiming lost money, they're about scaring people.

Here's the question - how much money is $140k *to you*?  
Is it 5% of your portfolio?  If so, then of course you're not sweating it.
Is it 95% of your portfolio?  Then you may want to consider putting down the kool-aid a bit and diversifying.  Bitcoin losing *all* value is (and has always been) a very real scenario.  Investing in bitcoin was never a sure profit.
And how much did you buy at?  If you bought at $50 a coin, then you know you still have ample time to bail and still make a profit.  You're playing with house money, and that clouds everything about the way you evaluate your holding.  But, *a lot* of people bought at $500, and $800, and even $1200 - they have every reason to be panicking right now.  
Part of the problem with the bitcoin community is they are treating their holdings with way too much emotion.  You need to be emotionless, and part of that is knowing when is a smart time to cut your losses.

He's talking about the investors (like many around here) who are buying bitcoin purely in the hope that it's going to go up in value.  It's not fundamentally sound investing, it's gambling.  It's rat poison because the potential is attractive and shiny but realistically everybody is going to lose their money.  Rats think poison is good for them, but it ends up killing them.
In other words, he thinks bitcoin is going to fail and investors (the rats) are going to lose a lot of money.

You misunderstood me.  *If* bitcoin is only successful in a handful of 3rd world countries, *then* bitcoin is completely dependent on the economic stability of those countries.  
It's not "tied up" in a specific sense, but if 95% of its use comes in 3 countries, and 1 of those countries goes belly up, then bitcoin is going to shit the bed.  Simplified, but hence the risk if bitcoin relies heavily on a 3rd world nation.

Nobody is buying from you because a 10% premium is *a lot*.  I completely understand why you need to charge that premium, but it's just too much to justify the convenience of a credit card.  
Anyone who buys those coins from you is going to do one of two things with it.  1 - Spend it, or 2 - hold onto it and sell it down the road for a profit.  If they plan on spending it, they're better off just using their credit card and saving themselves 10%.  And if they plan on holding and selling, you've just increased their cost basis by 10%.
You're only going to appeal to a very small niche of people who want the convenience of a credit card and don't care about immediately losing 10% like that.

Here's the thing...
Can you avoid reporting that $4.32 a few times and get away with it?  Yes, sure, absolutely.  You can probably do it 500 times for 5 years and be fine.  Hell, maybe even longer.  
But if, for whatever reason, you ever get audited - be it randomly, or something else in your life throws up a red flag (maybe an inheritance, selling a house for too much money, and all sorts of crazy possible scenarios), or hell even just buying a house in bitcoin would surely trigger you... you *will* get fucked for not declaring all those $4.32 gains over the years.  
The IRS will take no pity on you, because you will have demonstrated a conscientious willingness to break the rules.  They may not be able to track every bitcoin purchase, but if you regularly use bitcoin, it's going to be mighty easy for them to dig into your purchase history on online sites, look at any transactions coming out of your bank account, etc, etc.  They'll get access to your computer, phone, and wallet(s), and be able to look at whatever they want.
You really don't want to screw around with the IRS.  Nobody likes the IRS, and their labyrinthine laws seem like insanity more often than not, but we *all* have to follow them.  If you don't, you're playing with fire with one of the few government agencies that knows what they are doing.

There are a few silly things about that "model", but for one glaring example, regulation pressure is capped at 40%.  If the US comes out one day and says "Bitcoin is illegal for any US citizen to own due to money laundering concerns", that's going to all but kill bitcoin.
How do you even begin to model something that may have an invisible sword hanging over its head?  No to mention dozens of other extremely complex variables that are going to differ by country.

Got it.  Not trying to split hairs, but you're not being "paid in bitcoin" then.  You're being paid in USD (or whatever originating currency) and having it deposited into bitcoin for you.

You're in high school - it may sting a bit, but your financial life hasn't even begun yet.  Consider it a cheap and very valuable early life lesson.  You'll appreciate it later in life when you have real money to invest, bills to pay, and a family to support.
As an aside, anybody who hasn't invested a decent amount should really talk to somebody local and impartial about it before doing so.  Whether it is bitcoin, stocks, or anything else - it's very easy to do something colossally stupid and lose a lot of money quickly.

There's no blood in the streets here because the streets haven't even been built yet. 
It's a reasonable concept but it assumes a scale that simply doesn't exist with bitcoin. For all we know anything over $1 a coin is just a massive bubble that will fall back to corrective levels. We just don't know. There's very little to go on when setting a value for bitcoin, so it's hard to say if there is even a floor. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:25:01
Because companies like Coinbase don't care which crypto(s) win.  Their business model is cryptocurrency agnostic.  
So why attach themselves to a single horse in the race when they can play the field and succeed no matter who wins?  It's just unnecessary risk.  
Bitcoin is the lead horse right now so they market in that direction, but they could change that in a split second if the bottom ever fell out on bitcoin.  But if they invest heavily in mining and are sitting on a pile of their own personal bitcoin stash when the bottom falls out, that would be a fatal disaster.

Is it really?  Then you have to renegotiate every time the price goes up/down by more than a few percent.  Which is still a weekly (and often daily) occurrence these days.  The only businesses I can see paying out in bitcoin right now are either trying to do something discreetly, or they already maintain part of their assets in bitcoin.  Otherwise no sane business would withstand the present volatility through their payroll costs.

I *think* what he's trying to say is that historically the bitcoin ecosystem has been oversaturated with speculators, which has lead to abnormally high pricing.  Now, more merchants and consumers spending bitcoins are entering the ecosystem, thus broadening the appeal of bitcoin.  That's good for bitcoin, but not necessarily the price of bitcoin, because with it comes lots of price correction.  
It's basically a strange use of the term "horizontal market".

Why is this a "pro" bitcoin sub?  I like the long-term idea of a cryptocurrency but I'm generally skeptical of bitcoin.  However, bitcoin is relevant and interesting enough that I follow along as closely as anyone. Bitcoin isn't perfect, and even the most ardent supporters should recognize that.  A community should be able to talk about the negatives just as much as the positives.

It's not escrow, at all.  
Escrow says "yep - I got the item, looks ok, pay the man."  Now you can never get your money back unless the merchant is willing.
Chargeback says "I had this for 3 days and this piece fell off under normal use, and now the merchant won't return my phone calls."  In this scenario you would have already cleared the escrow 3 days ago.
Chargebacks offer a much deeper level of consumer protection over escrow.
And as I pointed out elsewhere, escrow for small charges is impractically cumbersome and costs money.  With a credit card I get chargeback ability automatically on everything.

Your idea has all the merit in the world, but you clearly didn't do your homework.

I don't fully disagree with the transparency model, but at the same time I'm not sure it doesn't do anything besides complicate things.
It could also have an inverse effect for everybody.  When people knowingly pay for something, they are more apt to use it.  That drives up costs for everyone, and even increases merchant rates due to higher chargeback rates.

What in the world are you talking about with stealing funds?
People are willingly storing their bitcoins with Coinbase.  Just like the average consumer doesn't think about how PayPal works under the hood, one day people may not think about how Coinbase works under the hood.  If/when that happens, nobody gives a shit if their $1000 of digital online buying power is technically stored in bitcoins, dogecoins, or randomnewcoins.  So, Coinbase can just start diversifying their holdings, or even changing over altogether.  When you control the market you can do a lot of things.

This editorial is *awful*.
1, 3, and 4 are perfectly valid objections that the author did a poor job of defending against.  1) We don't use gold for currency either anymore, 3) Most people don't carry more than $100 in cash on them at any time, and 4) He misses the boat about as badly as you possibly can.  If my bank gets raided or collapses the government protects me.  If another Mt Gox type scandal happens and my coins are stored there, they are gone.
2 is merely an objection against long-term ownership (a valid one at that), not using them.  Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies can legitimately replace PayPal without worrying about volatility too much.
I've never actually heard anyone leverage  as an objection to using bitcoin.

No matter how hard or easy it is to do is irrelevant, the point is that regardless of the law in question, a large percentage of people will always get away with crimes.

I'd rather inconvenience and risk the safety of 3-4 friends and we will do it ourselves."
There's nothing wrong with a PO Box, and it's required for people who don't get USPS to their door in many areas.  But to go 20 years without leveraging any form of home delivery, *especially* now in the Internet era, is either extreme paranoia or trolling.

Jail time for non-violent crimes is a major deterrent.  If the penalty was just financial, then willingly committing the crime would often be the smart thing to do.  There's already a very good chance you aren't going to get caught, and then if all you have to do is pay back the money you laundered, at worst you're back in the same place you would have been if you never did the crime in the first place.  And while you could add punitive financial damages, often times you can't squeeze blood from a stone, so it wouldn't work.  For example, let's say you had very little money to your name, then embezzled 2 million dollars.  If you get caught, you could be assessed with a punitive fine of 5 million dollars on top of the 2 million you embezzled, but then the odds that you ever make another 5 million to pay the fine are slim.
Long story short, the system isn't perfect, but there is a lot of thought put into much of it.

Not at all.  The price could easily crater as it reaches a transactional equilibrium state.  If people are just immediately getting in and out as a means of transaction (much like a credit card clearing house), then there's no excess demand driving the price up.  And there's nothing saying that bitcoin isn't already incredibly overpriced based on future potential.

For a couple of reasons.  One, as people already mentioned, a heavy percentage goes unused (like 20-50%).  Two, it gets people into the store, and quite often sells them into a more expensive item than what that $50 gift card cost.  Three, even if they only spend exactly the $50 on that card or whatever, there is still likely a good profit margin on that item.
Net-net stores are happy to bulk sell gift cards for a heavy discount.

I'd love to see some data on that, because that would be news to me.  *Most* businesses plan on cashing out at some point, in one way or another.  
It's very rare for anything more than a small mom+pop local company to hold on for themselves for very long.  And that's largely because the value in those types of businesses comes almost purely from the people running it.  A good restaurant or a small plumbing company could completely fall apart in months with another person running them.  Thus, they're not attractive acquisitions.
Anything directly involved in the transfer of bitcoin is almost by definition, conceptually created to scale globally.  I can't think of a single online bitcoin related business that could get incredibly popular and *not* be an acquisition target some day.

Pricing involves a lot of factors, and the cost of transactions (i.e. credit card fees) just gets rolled into the overhead.  Stores are never going to be "bitcoin only", so it's just going to be one more factor to roll into the pricing consideration.  Net-net there is zero chance you'd ever see a 2% price reduction.  I find that a really odd talking point in the bitcoin community.  Again, stores don't do it now for cash, and they don't do it now for ACH/checks, so there is absolutely no reason to believe why they would do it for bitcoin.


All manufacturers offer warranties on their products.  Many credit cards double and/or triple them.  Bitcoin doesn't do that.  So not sure what you're trying to say here...


Nobody is going to bother with escrow on a $50 charge.  It's not about being unwary, it's about a store not taking back a bad product, or an item that got lost in shipping, or a host of other reasons why chargebacks are awesome for consumers.  


Merchants don't have a lot of say in the matter.  They hate chargebacks, yet here we are today.  Consumers drive this industry forward, and chargebacks are again, awesome for consumers.
What I was questioning is why would you, the consumer, ever want to buy something with bitcoin right now vs a credit card?

The government has all sorts of banking regulations around validating the customer.  (KYC)  
When you get a regular ATM card, the issuing bank has already done the necessary background check and information processing on you behind the scenes.  Thus when you use the card it is painless.  
However, if you walk up to a bitcoin ATM as a completely new person, they need to do some relatively heavy validation to determine who you are.  If they didn't do this, they'd be in violation of all sorts of KYC compliance, and thus open themselves up to large scale money laundering schemes.

Well, you could just as equally argue that the network effect *was* the fundamental driver of Bitcoin in 2013, and now that the network effect is a largely tapped out resource.  i.e. most people who cared enough to buy bitcoins did so in 2013.  Now we have no more buyers, and existing buyers/supporters don't have enough money to keep the price afloat.  Thus the drop.

Credit cards are one of the least effective ways to steal ones identity. Due to the easily lost nature of cards, there's extremely little PII stored on them or accessible. 
As for bad marks on credit, if you don't pay off your balance every month like clockwork, you shouldn't own a credit card. Despite the name, they shouldn't be used for genuine credit needs except in emergencies.

More likely it will turn into a PR disaster for bitcoin as well.  If the US government can seize coins from normal citizens *that* easily, it's just going to make potential investors that much more hesitant to bother dealing with bitcoins.  And if that is what happened, we all know there are going to be more silk roads and exchanges supporting them - so what stops the exact same scenario from playing out again?
Not saying you're wrong - but if you're right, it would be disastrous for bitcoin.
As for PR disaster for the US - yes, sure, if you want to call it that.  But it's not like the US can't easily weather a PR disaster over bitcoin.  We just spent a decade fighting a war that pretty much nobody else in the world wanted us to fight, and the impact to the US was pretty much non-existent.  Bitcoin is only a concern to a tiny fraction of the population.

The average customer probably has to walk into a physical bank maybe 2-3 times a year.  ATM's, online banking, and phone-based customer service handles about 99% of what you need to do.  The only times you need to walk into a branch is for high volume stuff (like withdrawing huge amounts of cash), talking to somebody about a mortgage, maybe exchanging a foreign currency, etc.  It is exceptionally rare.
That's just a tiny branch for a huge bank - I'm sure an hour a week is plenty for such a small town.

I'm not opposed to taking risks, but you need to follow through on them or else you're just gambling.
i.e. when your position falls nearly 50%, you should either be buying more to get your costs basis down, or, cut your losses and get out now.  The worst thing you can usually do in a position like this is just ride it out - either it fails and you lose everything, or you need the price to double just to reach break even.

What potential fraud?
Me calling credit card bank: "Yeah I think my card was stolen - somebody bought this for $300 and that for $150 and neither were from me."
Credit card bank: "We apologize for the inconvenience sir.  Your cards have been cancelled effective immediately, new cards are being mailed out to you today, and the refunds for the fraudulent charges will hit your account within 24 hours.  Is there anything else we can help you with today?"
Me: "Nope - that's it.  Thank you!"
Seriously - I've been through this process myself twice.  Hell, once the bank picked up on it before I did.
The biggest inconvenience of having a credit card stolen nowadays is having to change the numbers on your accounts that get charged automatically on a recurring basis.

It simply means it is illegal to buy/sell/possess, just like any other banned item.  Could you still do it and not get caught?  Sure.  
If you're going to buy it in any significant kind of amount, you need to get your money out of USD.  Any large bank transaction is automatically flagged.  You'd have to jump through some hoops just to get that money to a place the bank/fed would allow it to go, and even then, you need to be able to justify it if ever formally questioned.
Then, if you want to ever sell your bitcoin back into USD, you have the same problem.  But now, assuming you made a profit, you're also into the dilemma of either hiding that profit (and risking tax evasion), or declaring the profit and basically telling the government you've been dealing with bitcoin.
Now you have a major 3rd party problem as well.  No above board financial institution is going to even allow a US citizen to transact with bitcoin due to fears of the US government's long reach.  You'd need some crazy Pirate Bay style bitcoin platform to allow it.  
Long story short - it would be all but dead.  I can't foresee a major demand for a bitcoin black market like you see for other banned items like drugs, guns, etc.  


The US government already regulates the hell out of every other area of financial transactions for its US citizens.  Banks, stocks, credit, mortgages, and on and on...  
There's no reason why they *can't* start regulating bitcoin, and even outright banning it.  Whether they *should*, and how it should be done, is another debate altogether.

Not only does it *not* make you immune, it's going to make you a giant target if you ever make any decent money off of bitcoin.  
Unless your plan is to sit on a pile of bitcoin until you die and never buy anything, eventually you're going to want to do things like buy a house, a car, exotic travel, etc, etc.  Those things all leave trails in the real world, and if your tax declared income cannot adequately account for the money you are spending, the IRS will pin you to the wall.

You can say whatever you want, but the real world evidence disagrees with you.  
I disagree about cash being a useful comparison (particularly as something like 90% of commerce still happens offline), but fine, what about paying with ACH vs a credit card?  An ACH transaction costs a business well under $1 regardless of the amount, yet the credit card is going to be in that 2-3% range.  So, on a $1000 purchase, the merchant *should* be giving the ACH purchase a $20-$30 discount.  But they don't.
You can swap ACH with paypal/google/amazon linked from your bank account as well.  All of those are similarly cheaply priced.  All perfectly apropos digital comparisons to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:51:51
If you have $1000 in bitcoin, they're not really going to care, regardless of whether they know or not. If you have $100,000 worth, even if you are meticulous about your paper trail, be prepared to defend yourself in an audit. They'll look at your income, your bank account, your house, car, etc. if anything doesn't add up, they'll assume you are playing games with them. If at that point you don't fess up, it can turn into a criminal matter. 
You can't beat the IRS, it's been proven time and time again as the thing that takes criminals down. Best bet is just to play by their rules honestly and live a happy life.

I never said I was a professional, but if I were, the first thing I'd tell you is you should talk to a local tax attorney and stop taking advice on the Internet.
This is my last comment on this matter.  But one last attempt to make you understand...
Fraud is fraud, and it never goes away.  Let's say the IRS audits you in 5 years for some reason, maybe a stupid random reason.  As they look back at your 2014 tax returns, I assure you they are going to be thorough.  Very, very thorough.  Even if they didn't set out to screw you for bitcoin tax evasion, if they find it, they will nail you for it.  100% guaranteed.
To specifically answer your question, yes, the IRS very much will expect all 10s of millions of people to track their purchases.  As of right now, that's what they say, so that's what you do.  I don't even know why this sounds so crazy to you.  What do you think investors in stocks do?  Day traders see more transactions than somebody who buys everything with bitcoin, yet they are required to track every little trade, and they do.  Because if they don't, they go to jail.
Best advice you'll ever get around taxes - you can't beat the IRS, so don't try.

Bitcoin is two products in one.
One *is* a consumer product.  The other is a financial platform.  
The financial platform makes a lot of sense for businesses to shave some transaction fees off of their backend.  The problem is the vast majority of these transactions are net neutral - every bitcoin bought will be sold back into USD or whatever currency the company operates in.  Thus, no force on the price.  This is where I think bitcoin "succeeds", but it's not going to do much of anything for bitcoin's price.
Unfortunately for bitcoin, the price is going to be almost purely driven by consumer interest.  Until bitcoin is at least equivalent, if not superior, to existing consumer financial instruments (and it's not even close yet), consumers aren't going to buy.

Paypal and credit card companies getting involved defeats much of the purpose of bitcoin.  For a company like PayPal, there may be pockets of situations where it is financially beneficial to transact in bitcoin, but they  already have large accounts with rock bottom costs in most local currencies.  It costs them near-zero to transfer money from one bank to another within a currency like USD - they're certainly not going to take on the overhead of switching in/out of a local transaction currency into bitcoin and vice versa.
Where bitcoin (or another crypto) has a real chance is *replacing* somebody like PayPal.  But, to do that, there has to be the inherent ability to reverse a transaction.  (Even if it's a modal flag, so people can do it either way)  But, to do that, you need to have a better tracking on an account and corresponding state (along with penalties), and that's where I start to get stuck on bitcoin.  IMO you can either be anonymous or you can have mass consumer appeal - I'm not sure how you can do both.

A chargeback by itself is not a fraudulent thing, they can just be used in fraudulent ways.  Unfortunately that gets into a giant grey area of he-said/she-said, and the credit card company will side with the consumer almost every time.  In fact, it's nearly impossible to get a chargeback overturned as a merchant for any online transaction.  The only reasonably successful overturns are going to be hand processed credit cards with physical signature and ID check.
All it takes is the teeniest tiniest gripe against Circle, and boom, chargeback approved.

This is a general password issue, not just a bitcoin issue.
Good rules of thumb:

How bad would it be to wake up from a car accident only to realize you can't remember the password to access your money?  With a bank there are other ways to get it.  If you are storing it yourself, you better have a good alternative.
-  If you're going to write something down, store it in two different physical locations.  (Like, your office and your house, or your house and your friend's house)  Fires happen, and paper burns easily.

If USD ever crashed that badly, it would mean something terrible happened to the country, and the entire world would fall into a disastrous economic depression.  Thus bitcoin would be caught up right there with it, along with pretty much everything else.  
I totally get your argument if you are choosing between bitcoin and Zimbabwean dollars, but a country like the US is so important to the global economy that there is a natural "safety net" in place with the currency.  You're not risking much by holding USD other than a bit of exposure against your own country's currency.  Which means if you live in the US, there is about zero real risk of holding up to FDIC insured levels.

Via ACH or check?  About a dime in real costs, and the majority of banks would do it for free.
Via wire?  Maybe $25-$50, depending on the banks and countries involved.
Cryptocurrency's value does *not* come from being cheaper than traditional banking accounts.  The pricing differential there falls somewhere between comparable and negligible.  I don't know why people continue to misunderstand this.  Banking is *cheap*.  Credit cards are expensive for other reasons, and can be applied to cryptocurrencies just like any other currency.
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:15:24
Because if the centralized service gets too big, the service becomes more important to consumers than the crypto itself, and then the service can easily move away from any one crypto.
Coinbase et al don't really give a shit if the crypto that wins is bitcoin, or dogecoin, or whatever else comes down the road.  They just want to be the next PayPal.  So, if they find themselves in a situation where 90% of bitcoin accepting merchants are tied into Coinbase, and 90% of bitcoin buying consumers are tied into Coinbase, Coinbase suddenly wields all the power.  Coinbase could instantly tell everyone that they are creating a new crypto called CoinbaseCoin, convert everybody's bitcoin into CoinbaseCoin, and tell consumers/merchants that fees are lowered across the board with zero loss of utility.  Everybody wins in this scenario, except people who own Bitcoin outside the Coinbase ecosystem.  Those people get screwed.
There's no denying the benefits of centralized services, but you can't have your cake and eat it too.  Supporting centralized services now to get the good stuff means you're also supporting centralized services down the road and you're going to have to deal with the bad stuff that could happen.

Your analogy is perfectly fine if the people worried about a few grand have $100K+ portfolios.  Otherwise, it's off.  These investors pumping hundreds of millions into bitcoin startups are managing billion dollar portfolios, and the opportunity costs of being on the sideline if bitcoin were to ever take off is *much* higher than the money they stand to lose by trying to play in the space right now.
If anybody has more than 5-10% of their portfolio invested into bitcoin right now, they really need to do some hard thinking about *why*.  It's extremely risky, and nobody needs to take on that risk.


I don't see any of them panicking.
Again, much like the institutional investors with billion dollar portfolios, these executives are playing with house money.  If they take a bitcoin job and bitcoin succeeds, they'll make a fortune.  If they take a bitcoin job and bitcoin fails, they'll skip off to another highly paid executive job.  They won't take any blame for a bitcoin site failing, so they're well insulated.

*Anybody* investing in bitcoin is a risk taker.  Cryptocurrency has been about as volatile of an asset class as you can possibly get.  The only thing that separates the smart ones from the "dumb" ones right now is the smart ones are only dabbling a small part (5-10%) of their savings in bitcoin.  Anyone investing 50% (or more) in bitcoin is gambling with their money.

You're missing the point grossly.  The whole "blood in the streets" saying refers to a reasonably predictable market.  If the stock market crashes 30% tomorrow, it's *going* to go up over the next X years, because if it doesn't it would mean total economic collapse and an apocalyptic scenario.  Thus, it's good to buy on such a huge drop.
With bitcoin, this could all go away to nothing in 5 years.  It's a *tiny* user base, unpredictable, and unproven.  
The fact that you don't even want to entertain that this may be a big giant bubble is foolish.  I'm not saying there *is* a bubble, I'm saying it's a reasonable view that there *may* be, and thus people should proceed with caution and stay diversified.

None of which house my money.


Correct me if I'm wrong, but on PayPal I believe you only see the subscribed name of a non-business user *after* you conduct a transaction.  I know I've had a few shaky craigslist originated transactions for tickets and stuff over the years where I've paid out to an address and kind of breathed a sigh of relief once I see they are a registered user with a traceable name that correlates to the person I was corresponding with.
More importantly, since when is "well everybody else is doing it" a valid defense?  Didn't we all learn this lesson in grade school?  
I know I'd never put more than a few bucks into any financial institution that so willingly revealed my real name, email address, and status as an active user.  At the very least, one has got to be able to opt-out of this functionality.

Because they are meeting a market demand at the moment that isn't necessarily congruent with their longterm goals.  Right now people want an easy way to transact with bitcoin, because bitcoin is getting some hype and traction.  So, Coinbase built a product to meet that need.


They'll move away from it as soon as it makes sense for them to do so.  Bitcoin doesn't need to "suck balls" for that to happen.  Maybe they move to save fees, maybe they move to increase transaction speed, maybe they move for some other reason.  You can't predict the future, and the point is that if Coinbase (or any other platforms) ever get too big, they absolutely can move if they want to.


Yep, it's a starting point.  That doesn't necessarily mean bitcoin is the ending point.  If you build a product on top of something else, and keep building on top of that, suddenly you've added *a lot* of value on top of the base product.  At some point, all that extra value could be more valuable than the base product.

Aside from black/grey markets and other illegal goods, what, exactly, is the average consumer better off purchasing with bitcoin instead of a credit card?


This lie needs to die.  99% of merchants do not give discounts for using cash, which is even more cost efficient than bitcoins.  They're not going to magically start providing bitcoin discounts, which still has some additional infrastructure and accounting costs.  
Even then, that's not even necessarily a true statement.  1-5% back on a credit card is fairly common nowadays.  (Quicksilver 1.5%, Amex Blue 3-6% on gas/groceries, Discover rotating 5% back, etc)  The only retailers right now who are going to give you 5% discount for using bitcoin are those with ultra high margins trying to drum up the extra business from bitcoin holders.  Amazon or your local grocery store isn't going to give you that kind of discount.
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:12:47
You're drastically undervaluing chargebacks.  Yes, consumers occasionally abuse them, but most of them are legitimate, and often the last (and only) line of defense standing between a consumer getting screwed by a merchant.  People who abuse chargebacks will quickly start getting rejected by the bank and are more likely to lose the chargeback.
It's not just the chargeback itself either, but the mere *threat* and *ability* to do a chargeback that helps keep merchants in line.  Merchants know if they screw a consumer paying by credit card, the consumer has recourse.


Again, the consumer choice is ideal, but in reality, there won't be any price discounts.  The vast majority of merchants simply aggregate their various fees and build it into the cost of goods sold.  Just like very few places give you a cash discount, very few places are going to give you a bitcoin discount.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:29:14


Because it's not a mistake.


Yes, it does.  Well, technically it competes most closely with PayPal, but that is picking nits.  Bitcoin and credit cards are practically interchangeable options with anyone who accepts bitcoin.


Well, right now nearly 100% of people who use bitcoin are also buying bitcoin with currency.  So right now bitcoin really is just a layer on top of other currencies, at least for transactional purposes.


*Maybe*.  A lot depends on what happens over the next few years.  At a highly level, the nuts and bolts of credit card processing are already digital.  It's just a bunch of banks and institutions pushing bits and authorizations around, with periodic settlements of large amounts of money.
Right now, throwing a credit card on top of bitcoin is really just adding an extra layer to things.  Until Visa, banks, merchants, and consumers are all widely and routinely holding bitcoin, it doesn't make much sense.

The roads are a great example.  Perhaps you live in a city and don't own a car, so you don't want to pay for roads.  Great, well that means you probably take public transportation, and taxes are subsidizing your costs so you're not paying $10 per subway ride.

Sorry, but those two statements are incongruent.  If the bottom falls out on the cryptocurrency market you would wipe out years of portfolio gains and set yourself back a very long time.  That's the antithesis of diversification, which is to protect your portfolio from the risk of any one asset class falling apart.

There are some major differences here.  The RIAA has a private organization, and while they have deep pockets, their influence over government is highly limited.  On the other hand, the IRS is arguably the most airtight, powerful, and unswayable organization in the US.  The IRS doesn't care about who is right and who is wrong, they only care about enforcing their rules.
In other words, everybody knows that copying a CD has zero real-world repercussions.  But trying to cheat the IRS is just asking for a problem.

Don't strain yourself trying to understand why a price goes up or down. Sometimes it can be tied to a reason, but often times it can't. 
The most likely reason for the recent decline is simply correction for 2013's soar in price. It very well may drop to under $100 before it stabilizes. A lot of people got very excited about bitcoin in 2013 and bought - those were early adopters. There are just not enough new buyers flowing in right now, as quite frankly, bitcoin doesn't have the greatest reputation with the general public at the moment.

It would take years and *billions* (yes, *billions*) of dollars in funding to even have a shot at competing with Ebay.  And that assumes you do everything right.  And it assumes you can hire employees as talented as the 35,000 that work at Ebay, because you're not doing this with a few random web developers.
There are many invisible mountains to deal with on a site like Ebay, but just one huge one you probably don't think about is fraud. They literally spend more money and resources on their fraud department than 99% of the Internet spends on their entire business.

Escrow is not a practical solution.
For one, escrow services cost money to use.
For two, they're a good bit of hassle and it really disrupts the transaction process.
Escrow has its place, such as in the purchase of a $5000 piece of jewelry.  But it's just not a practical solution for everyday purchases.  Most of the chargebacks I've filed over the years were just on small/cheap items - things I'd never use escrow for but I was happy to get my $50 or whatever back because the company wouldn't make things right.


I know we're in r/bitcoin, but you don't really believe this FUD, do you?  No credit card issuer can survive in today's day and age without fraud protection.  If your card gets stolen, you're not responsible.  (And I've had my card/number stolen multiple times over the years).


An item was not as advertised, an item was delivered broken and the merchant wouldn't replace/exchange it, an item was missing (common if you order a bunch of stuff), the order never arrived (lost in shipping), accidental double charges and other billing errors, continually charging after canceling a subscription, and on and on and on.  Many valid reasons for chargebacks to exist.

There seems to be this rather strange viewpoint around here that the miners give two shits about the long term success or failure of bitcoin.  Perhaps the early miners did, but the majority of the miners who get involved nowadays are just in it for the quick buck.  They're more than happy to join the party to make some money, leave a giant mess in their wake, and then move on to the next "get rich quick" scheme once Bitcoin has been devoured.
It's not even the pool operators - it's a fundamental flaw with the way mining currently works.  Either that changes, or this problem isn't going to go away.

Their true costs are not very much at the volume of somebody like PayPal - that 2-3% is mostly profit margin.  They might pay 5 cents to draw $100 out of somebody's bank account and another 5 cents to send it to another user.  Then they turn around and add $3 in fees for the privilege.  ACH is incredibly cheap.

It's also largely marketing.  These merchants know that early bitcoin adopters are salivating for places to spend bitcoin, and thus by accepting bitcoin it garners them a ton of free publicity amongst a crowd that is eager to spend.

ACH will settle quicker than that, the issue is you can clawback an ACH transaction within the 3 day range. That leaves Coinbase very vulnerable to fraud. Thus when they see volume spiking they likely get more careful as they are at higher risk.

There's no theories or anything nefarious going on here. 
Your bank is responsible to make sure you are not using them to launder money. Selling bitcoin offline is not necessarily illegal, but it is untraceable and has the high potential to be done in an illegal manner. You have no idea where that $8500 or whatever cash came from. If it was a drug dealer, congrats, you just helped them launder money. 
Your bank also has no way of knowing and doesn't want to take that chance. Thus they shut you off.

You're touching on a much larger concept called diversification, but you're not really looking at it correctly.  
For one, if you want to include cryptocurrency that's fine, but you should also consider holding about 100 different asset classes that are *larger* than the entire cryptocurrency market combined.  Diversification is a good thing, but you need to be smart/practical about it based on relative market sizes.
For two, you shouldn't even be holding that much money in *any* form of currency.  You should be investing it across a very wide variety of stocks and bonds.  Your cash/bitcoin/gold asset classes should be less than 10% of your entire portfolio combined.  (assuming you actually have enough money to call it a portfolio)

I wouldn't say it's 100%, but it's damn close.  There are a few people out there who genuinely believe in the benefits of cryptocurrency, and own bitcoin because it's the most popular one at the moment.  Those people don't care about the price anymore than your average citizen cares about the exchange rate between USD and EUR.
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:09:16
Directly from that attack they gain nothing. But, it's a market manipulation tactic. Perhaps it causes the price to drop a bit, or trading volume and liquidity to slow. Then when the attack stops and the good news comes out, everything returns back to normal.  In the meantime, there are inefficiencies that can be exploited for profit. 
Financial companies spend millions of dollars on security to protect against this sort of stuff. As long as popular parts of the bitcoin universe are run on shoestring budgets, these kind of shenanigans are going to happen frequently. You won't even know about them most of the time.

Putting all your chips on bitcoin is silly no matter how you go about it.  
If you invest, invest in other cryptos as well.  
If you build a business, make sure it can play with other cryptos as well.
When you do this properly, you don't really care which crypto succeeds/fails.  You succeed as long as the concept of a cryptocurrency succeeds, and you only fail if the concept fails.

Don't ever put money in places that will cause you or your partner stress. If she's pissed at you now, what do you think she's going to say if bitcoin drops below $100?
You can either invest safely or you can invest with risk. Bitcoin is very risky, and you need to be able to tolerate that. 
Also keep in mind that no matter how much you believe in something, it doesn't mean everybody else will. Your belief doesn't control the price of bitcoin, rather the collective belief of people like your wife is what will determine its outcome. Early adoption can lead to dangerously skewed perspectives. 
Only you can decide what to do at this point to ride it out or cut your losses.  But your relationship isn't worth damaging over this money.

It's a fair counterpoint, but it still creates an awful lot of risk to invest in mining at the scale necessary to make a difference.  If it all goes to shit, you're better off losing 1x instead of 3x (or whatever) your investment to fund the business you're trying to build.
I'd also add that I think public acceptance is *many* years away - these guys are all playing the niches right now in the hopes of positioning themselves in that right spot for when that day comes.  I think you could easily see Bitcoin fail, *and* the next "chosen one" crypto fail, and the public still might not be ready for cryptos yet in that timeframe.

I find that people have a very naive view of what would happen to banks and large financial institutions if bitcoin ever truly took off.  Banks aren't going to close, they're just going to adapt.  Nothing they really do has to change just because the currency in play is USD vs bitcoin.  There are still going to be cards and savings accounts and all sorts of other services that banks provide.
Thus, while large institutions tend to prefer the status quo, they're absolutely going to hedge their bets.  *Now* is the time for legal groundwork on cryptocurrencies, and you can bet that every large financial institutions is thinking about what laws they can create right now that will give them an advantage in the long run.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:33:05
Credit, duh.  It's what drives the banking world today, and that won't change a lick regardless of what happens in the future.  Bitcoin/cash/paypal/etc are just mediums.  
People will still need mortgages and HELOCs and student loans and credit cards and all sorts of other stuff that has nothing at all to do with dollars vs bitcoins.  
This is a silly argument, precisely because the deflationary nature of bitcoin alone means it won't work for credit, which means USD et al are never going away, which means big banks will be around forever. But even if a cryptocurrency did work for credit, the concept of credit is never going away, and thus you will always need lenders.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:14:01
There is clearly a fundamental misunderstanding from people about just how much the credit card company sides with the consumer.  
But, IMO that consumer protection is a *very good thing*.  
Yes, people occasionally abuse chargebacks, but it's not as big of a problem as you'd think.  The reality is, as a consumer, you only get a small number of chargebacks over a given period of time before you start sending up red flags.  You'll begin getting denied, and eventually even kicked off your card.  You can churn through cards, but it's not a good thing to have a credit card shut down for consumer suspected fraud.  You will end up in blacklist databases if you are caught doing it, especially multiple times.
Companies like this one feeling the brunt of these chargebacks are more the nature of the business they operate.  You simply *have* to build a high chargeback rate into your margins - it's what all sorts of businesses do if they are more at risk.  It's not always a person trying to fuck them over, they may just not feel they were delivered the goods "as advertised".
Chargebacks are *extremely* important for consumers, and the  reason why I would never buy something of significant value (right now) with bitcoin.  Everyone has stories about how some company fucked them over (either through incompetence or maliciousness), and if you pay by credit card, that's your last line of defense to getting your money back.  And it works almost 100% of the time when you really need it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:06:35
Nothing, because bitcoin as of right now is non-reversible.  
So either the entire protocol needs to change, or, people need to build elaborate systems on top of bitcoin to support chargebacks.  (think similar to what PayPal does with merchants and bank accounts, but for bitcoin)  
IMO this is a fatal flaw with bitcoin, and why (as it stands right now) I don't ever see banks and the credit universe adopting bitcoin.  They'll go for another reversible digital currency instead if/when the time comes to abandon fiat.
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:26:03
If you believe that, then shouldn't you be buying the crap out of all the other cryptocurrencies right now?
If bitcoin really ever fell to $6, there would be very serious concerns about its future and you'd be taking on a massive risk to the point that $6 would seem expensive at the time. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:43:38
And the follow up question, would you have not just used a credit card to buy the same things at the same (or lower) price?
More to it, did you not just cost yourself money by not getting the cash back on a credit card when you chose to use bitcoin?
Cryptocurrencies have a place, but I'm not convinced that place lies with people who can afford tvs and home theater systems. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 20:23:34
That's a rather silly comparison.  Bitcoin is not a bank.
Most currencies are just as open to everyone as bitcoin.  In fact, you could easily argue that your native domestic currency is *more* open to you than bitcoin.  Bitcoin requires a computer/device, internet access, and a healthy bit of knowledge about how to use it.  Cold hard cash requires absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:25:16
Many people *should* have taken some kind of action in the drop  from 630 to 460 over the last month.  Whether it's a buy to dollar cost average, or a sell to stop some bleeding (or capture some remaining profit), there should be some strategy in place as to how one should handle a 25%+ drop over one month's time.  
The only real argument to do nothing is a genuine long position where you bought for under the current price.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:32:36
Of course you are a speculator if you are putting *all* your savings into bitcoin.  If you weren't speculating, and just wanted to "stay safe from the government", you would be spreading your money around into multiple currencies (crypto and fiat) or other safe investment vehicles (bonds, metals, stocks, etc).  
Instead you're sticking *everything* into a hyper volatile commodity.  That's speculation.

Because Circle has a small fortune in well-respected financial backing and proven leadership, and they were able to cut a sweetheart deal on processing fees because of their connections and standing.

You can send a bank wire with just about any bank for a few bucks, which is still a tiny rounding error on 82 million.  Hell, you can even do it for free with many banks in-country.

*Extremely* few retailers nowadays raise prices for credit cards (or offer cash discounts).  In fact, in many situations in the US it's illegal to differentiate between cash and credit prices.

Circle's plan is probably some combination of eventually buying/selling everything via the "bitcoin bank of Circle", and eventually asserting fees if/when they have established market dominance.  i.e. at huge volume there really is no cost at all to them, and they can make money on tiny fees that aren't worth the hassle while starting out.

Large financial institutions nowadays employ a variety of different security measures - biometrics, voice recognition, multi-factor authentications, time delay safeguards, etc, etc.  In combination those things tend to be pretty close to bullet proof.  And even in the crazy event that it all fails, there is always a paper trail of where the money went, and an institution to be held accountable.

The second point needs to be fully understood by everyone. The way merchants have adopted bitcoin is doing nothing but driving the price down. They're all immediately cashing out, so at best, it's net neutral for the bitcoin price. Realistically, some percentage of buyers are using bitcoin they already owned, so it's a net sell, and thus a decrease. 
None of these merchants really care about bitcoin, they just want to win the money of people who are eager to buy things with bitcoin.

Delays happen all the time in every industry though, and there's never any way to prove if the dates were ever achievable or not.  Thus if you made it illegal to say "shipping on date x", then no company would ever put out a street date until it was 100% certain, and you'd never have any idea when anything was ever coming out.  The unintended consequence of holding a company's feet to the fire over a release date would kind of suck for consumers.
Not to say they weren't completely disingenuous, but I don't think just saying "shipping on date x" is something to be made illegal.  There has to be a healthy bit of "buyer beware" on street dates...

You're investing with emotion, which is never a good place to be. I don't care what financial vehicle you are in, you *always* need to be mentally prepared for a major crash, and readily accept that it is just as likely of an outcome as making money. 
Doing that ensures you keep your portfolio properly diversified, which will make you the most money in the long run. It's fine to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. 
By the sound of it, you either have a trivial amount of money invested in Bitcoin, or you are being extremely foolish.

Nobody questions that a miner can make more money if they hold onto the coins and the value goes up.  But, that's no guarantee at all.  There *is* a guarantee that if you mine and sell quickly you will make money.  You can then take that money and invest it anywhere you like.

Aside from Gox's US connections, there are two reasons *why* a company might have to listen to the US.
For one, if it ever wants to do business with US citizens, it needs to stay on good terms.  Else the US can make life difficult - from blackballing banks from transferring to the service, all the way to outright declaring the service illegal.
For two, the US influence is *incredibly* strong over friendly countries that rely on the US for their own economy.  Japan is one such country, and Japan can do what they want to a service living in Japan.  For a service to stay completely out of the US reach it needs to reside in a country that is outside the reach of US influence.

Seriously though - if you want to be untraceable, you're never going to beat cold hard cash exchanged in person.  
The more popular Bitcoin gets, the more involved the US government is going to get, eventually to the point that they'll start monitoring the flow of every single coin.  (If they aren't already)  They're never going to allow any kind of truly anonymous sidechain or anything like that.  And if a product comes out that they can't trace at all, they'll just make it illegal.

Those are speculators.  If they've been holding since the early days, they've been holding in the hopes of it increasing in value.  
People don't sit on hoards of *any* currency unless they think it will increase in value.

But what happens *next time* when that same exact incompetence rears its ugly head again?  What if they suffer a worse attack and lose $50M worth of coins?  How in the world do we know and trust that what happened the other day won't happen to them again?  Or something even worse?

Because hindsight is 20/20.


To potentially rephrase in two months:


I'm not saying it was smart of people to try to catch the falling knife, and Bitcoin is clearly still in freefall, but there will be a bottom at some point.  Some people just believed it wouldn't go much lower than $400, so they bought.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:32:41
The price has almost nothing to do with how great Bitcoin is or is not.
The market gets constantly flooded with new coins, and there's just not enough people interested in Bitcoin yet.  The price has to plummet as existing holders don't have unlimited funds.  There maybe never be enough people interested to sustain a price over $100, and that's ok.  The technology will live on and be useful to the people that find it useful.
And if it turns out that Bitcoin completely collapses because almost nobody finds it useful, then it will prove that it really wasn't as great as everyone thought.  Everybody was clearly only interested to try to make money on it.

Again, it depends on your demographic profile.  If you're a 21 year old college student buying $1000-$3000 worth of bitcoin every month, you're going to set off flags.  If you're a 55 year old white male in the banking industry, you could buy 10x that and they're not going to blink.

People *really* need to stop using the word "cheap". They said it at 800, 600, 400, and now at 200. None of those levels were cheap, and the price could still drop to 20 bucks.

A lot of businesses do this already when they have to exchange foreign currencies, so there are methodologies to mitigate volatility.  But, currencies also aren't *that* volatile over the short term, and you have a lot of them to hedge with.  It's one thing to have to hold 1% of holdings/transactions in reserve for volatility insurance, but it's another thing entirely to have to hold 10%.  That could be a ridiculous amount of effectively dead cash sitting around just for volatility insurance.  And right now, if you had to protect against bitcoin volatility, I don't even know how high that number would need to be even for a modest 30 day window.  It hit over 30% drop just in the last 30 days.  
Point being - companies can indeed take it the last mile to volatility safety, but we are so far away from that point being possible.  It needs to naturally stabilize *a lot* before that's even an option.


The major ones are pretty damn stable over the short term.  Drastic sudden swings are rare.

@_date: 2015-01-14 20:26:01
It's incredibly easy to build up hundreds of thousands of wealth over your career.  Yes, if you work fast food all your life and refuse to make sacrifices, you're going to struggle.  But even with a very modest average 40K/yr job for your career, if you save 10% per year, and work a 45 year career, that's 180K on paper.  
Now invest that in a conservative diversified portfolio... in 45 years, at a modest 8% (stock market historically returns 10-11% over the long run), that puts you with a portfolio of over $1.5M at 65ish/retirement.  Now, granted that is not accounting for inflation, and estimates are not perfect, but over that many years you're *going* to make a lot of money if you save diligently and invest *smartly*.  And again, that was a modest 40K/yr average job, or less than what many teachers will make in their careers.  Take a white collar job for a lot more than that, and it amplifies quickly.
The two things most people in this country do wrong are:
- Refuse to spend below their means (which leads to not saving anything)
- When they do save, they want to be it *all* on black (i.e. bitcoin, a hot stock, some stupid investment offer, etc)
Very very few people "get rich quick" via investments.  It's basically like hitting the lottery.  However, lots of people "get rich slowly" via investments.

The majority of people that shopped at Target the day before the hack still shop there now.
On the other hand, Bitstamp is an online financial transaction system. Their security reputation is *everything* to this type of company.

You can take it a step further - Bitcoin just doesn't solve a problem for the average first world consumer.  
Even if it were easier to use than a credit card, and were able to offer up all the benefits of a credit card (cash back, fraud protection, chargebacks, 30 day float, etc), it still doesn't solve a problem.  Nobody has ever sat there in a checkout line and swiped their card saying "god that was so cumbersome!".  And Apple Pay, Google Wallet, et al are removing the need to even carry a card around.
Bitcoin's value lies in the backend, not as a consumer product (aside from black market shenanigans).  It's never going to take over the world, but it can have real value as a backend interchange between institutions.

It *doesn't matter* what the upward potential of Bitcoin is.  If the price goes lower from here, $200 is still not "cheap".
Let's say the price drops to $20, and then you hold for a decade and it is back at $1000.  Buying at $200 makes you a 5x return, buying at $20 makes you a 50x return.  That's an **enormous** difference.  
$200 may be a reasonable price if you plan on holding long, but cheap is a stupid word to be using.

You're both right with your axioms, but it's all about the situation when choosing which to apply, and the market is in a freefall right now.  
That makes the statistically better play to wait a bit.  (i.e. don't catch the falling knife)
Here's why:
If you buy now at $270, two things can happen.  One, it can continue to go down.  Or two, it can go back up.  If it goes down, you're now stuck in your position, and you have no idea how low it's going to go.  If it goes up, you obviously win. 
If you don't buy now, and the price goes down, you win.  If you don't buy now, and the price goes up, *you still don't lose*.  You can just buy at a slightly higher price.  It's a penalty you pay for the safety of knowing the freefall is over.
If you're going to play the short-term game, you need to pay attention to what is going on.  And right now you don't want to catch that knife.
Now, if you're planning on buying and holding for 10 years, then by all means, go buy now and don't even think of it, as if bitcoin succeeds long-term it won't matter what happens right now.

It still *does not* have legal tender status.  The headline was misleading.
Legal tender means a person in that jurisdiction cannot say 'no' to your attempt to pay for something.  Meaning, if you owe somebody $100 in the US, then the US Dollar is legal tender.  You can't offer them up 5 $20 bills and have them say "no thanks - I require this payment in twinkies".

Definitely one possibility.


The cost to mine is only one factor on the price.  There's absolutely no economic reason why mining needs to be profitable.  It may be necessary for bitcoin survival long-term, but that's a problem for bitcoin, not reality. Especially now that there are plenty of coins out there, mining is probably just flooding the market and accelerating the price drop.  


Which, IMO, is one of the fundamental flaws with creating a new currency out of thin air.  Speculation needs to be a tiny percentage of the use of a currency in order to achieve any kind of price stability.  And without price stability, it is very hard for a currency to be widely used in transactions.  So there's a nasty catch-22 in here.  Bitcoin probably needs to plummet to get nearly all of the speculators out before it can stabilize and start being *used* more widely.  Then of course the speculators will jump back in, and we may see this cycle repeatedly for another 20 years, until there are so many people using bitcoin that there's not much money to be made in speculation.

And there's a whole lot of bucks to be made in the wild wild west of the cryptocurrency world right now.  This wasn't the first incident, and it sure won't be the last one.  It will continue, over, and over, and over again until exchanges are able to afford and implement current best financial industry security practices.

He's a smart guy but he also has a heavily vested interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed.  Even smart guys are wrong all the time, and people with biases are always going to say what works best for them. 
Bottom line - Andreessen really doesn't know what's going to happen any more than a random Reddit poster, but it's literally his job to be positive and confident.

Anything is possible, but Glass is more of a punchline to consumers at this point than something desirable. 
There's little doubt that some form of Internet connected headset/eyepiece will be popular in the future. But whether that is Google Glass version 6 in 2035 or something else entirely, who knows.

You're not willing to acknowledge that the problem might be fixed after nearly 100 years without incident?
And banks have been defrauded since then. The difference is they're insured so it's not a huge deal.
IMO anyone trying to run a crypto exchange should be required to have comparable insurance. Or, at the very least, put up huge disclaimers about how they are not insured and your coins are at risk if they get hacked.

The volatility argument is fragile. What's the end game to the speculation?  Why do people suddenly stop speculating on Bitcoin?
People speculate on fiat currencies all the time, but the volume of the currency is so massive that the speculation is a minor issue.  So unless you add in the caveat of "when Bitcoin volume approximates a major currency", speculation is going to keep the price volatile. 
At best it's a rosey optimistic outlook, at worst it is just a convenient argument to brush aside a genuine issue.

Highly doubtful. More likely the price drop was the catalyst to force the theft. ie somebody got very in the hole with the drop and this was a way out.

Well, the *best* case scenario at this point is already horrendous.  They're already out 5 million dollars and an invaluable amount of consumer trust.  If and when they come back, those things will take years to recapture.  Nobody really wants to tie their name to a sinking ship like that, particularly as things can get a lot worse.
Point being, they may or may not know something that the public doesn't know, but regardless, just what the public knows is plenty to justify distancing oneself from Bitstamp.

At some point you need to pick your poison.
You can choose the regulations and safety of a US-based system like Coinbase or Circle.  
Or you can choose the anonymity and risk of the non-US systems.
There's no exchange out there that is going to be regulation *and* risk free.

Accepting an additional credit card is nothing more than a line item on an accounting spreadsheet and a couple of simple account settings with your payment processor.  
Accepting a completely different form of payment is a different integration, different vendor, different accounting and tax practices, different operational and support processes, etc, etc, etc.  
And 3% is a sizable amount.  If Bitcoin achieves 3% of a large merchant's sales, it will be a smashing success and nobody will have a problem supporting it.  The reality you're looking at right now is a tiny fraction of that amount.

The difference is this is the first time Bitcoin has had full widespread exposure.  There's no more fresh pasture of people learning about Bitcoin for the first time to help a rebound.  
For its price to come back this time, it has to come back on its own merits and people's belief in Bitcoin.  Not speculators trying to ride the tidal wave of the next hot thing, which is what pumped the price so quickly over $1000.
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:45:07
I'll be the first person in line to argue that 99% of the value of cryptocurrencies are the blockchain.  And I agree with what you're saying.  I'm just pointing out a hypothetical scenario where bitcoin craters in price due to failed consumer adoption but finds usage elsewhere.

Government bonds are usually the best place to be when the markets are on fire.  They may not be sexy and they may not get you a massive return, but a safe 2% gain is a hell of a lot better than a 30% loss.

Most married couples still also have individual credit cards.  Not only does it help keep personal finances tidy, but think about christmas presents and stuff like that.  There's often valid reasons you don't want your spouse seeing your credit card details.  And if you're going to go through with signing up for a service like this, you probably wouldn't see much issue with secretly signing up for your own personal credit card.
They also surely bill with an innocuous sounding name that nobody would ever think to question.  For example, if you run your card at a strip club it will usually say something harmless like "Champions Sports Bar and Grill".  The statement name technically doesn't have to be related to the name of the actual establishment.

No they're treating it exactly like a Venmo or a PayPal.  They buy bitcoin to buy things with bitcoin that the seller then immediately converts back into fiat currency.
Treating it like a currency would entail actually buying bitcoin with your entire paycheck every week, and then simply selling bitcoin for fiat for anything you need to buy that you can't buy with bitcoin.
The difference is in the delta/savings - holding it in bitcoin grows the bitcoin economy, holding it in USD does absolutely nothing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:02:23
That's the entire problem.  Almost everybody is treating bitcoin like an investment, and almost nobody is treating it like a store of currency.  
So all of the bitcoin transactions don't really mean much for the price if they are immediately getting sold.  It's just a very small amount in constant circulation.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:26:13
So you're an advocate for digital currency but you never even attempted a simple digital transaction in all the years you've been using your bank?  And then you choose to publicly shame said bank without even looking into it?
And you wonder why your mom doesn't want to listen to you talk about Bitcoin or why people here think you are full of it...

May 2014, and if you lived through the dotcom bust, you'd have seen firsthand how easy it was for companies to burn through 30 million in under 18 months.
They're estimated around 100 employees, so that's a good 10-15 million right there for 18 months of wages and overhead.  Then marketing, surely taking a loss on the product, etc, etc.
I doubt they've burned through the entire 30 million, but you don't want to spend the last dollar and then shut the lights off without changing anything.  It's possible they have 10 million left, realized their current business wasn't going to work, so cut down to a skeleton crew and plan on pivoting the business into something else.

VCs knew damn well what they were getting into with Bitcoin. It was a high risk all or nothing proposition. If it pays off, they'll make insane multiple. If it fails, it will fail spectacularly. Zero in between on it from their perspective.

Yeah, but what portion of that $12B are actually chains vs small businesses?  Every mom and pop in the country has gift cards now, and you're never going to be able to use the long tail.  And then of that $12B, realistically some huge number of those get lost/forgotten about, not just voluntarily unspent.  
I'd be shocked if your realistic addressable market size were much more than $1B or so. Then capturing some 1% of that would probably be a smashing success.
Like the above poster said, it's really not that big of a market.  There are many other players in the unused gift card space, and have been for years.  On the surface it seems like a ridiculous opportunity because of all the unused cards, but like the parent said, it ends up being thieves and drug dealers.  Other people either don't bother or they sell on Ebay for 95% of face value.

Bitcoin is not secure. Period. 
For one, any technology is only as secure as its weakest link. If you expect people to adhere to proper Bitcoin security practices, you're going to be sorely dissapointed. It's been 20 years and people still regularly use things like "password" for their password. 
For two, it's non reversible!  That's the worst possible scenario when theft is involved. Even if the stolen bitcoins are found there's no easy way to just push a refund button. With credit, checking, banks, etc - clawbacks and refunds are all readily in place to assist with fraud. 
For three, purely from a consumer perspective... You can't lose money via fraud on a credit card!  Banks covering any charges against a stolen card/number has been an industry standard for years. You can leave your card on the corner of the shadiest block in the city and don't have to worry about a thing. 
Bitcoin has a tremendously long way to go to be considered anything close to secure.

Day trading *is* gambling. Even the successful day traders will admit to that much. 
The only type of investing that isn't gambling is either a diversified portfolio or an FDIC backed account that returns very little. Everything in between is speculation to various degrees of extremity.

It's purely risk assessment.  And even once granted a merchant account, if your chargeback rate gets too high, you can either lose your account, or, your rates will get raised.
So yes, perhaps an exchange could get approved to take a credit card, but they may need to pay a 10% fee to use it due to their risk.
