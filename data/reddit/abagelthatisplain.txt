This assumes an ultimate adoption of bitcoin, by countries and governments, a very unlikely outcome.
People have savings account BECAUSE money value is decreasing over time and they need to spend money in the future. This is why savings accounts pay you a return, but that return isn’t high enough to justify not spending it, whereas bitcoin’s return is.

I don't understand how money works, yet you just perfectly described the Japanese economy which is suffering under the deflation of its currency...
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:23:51
That doesn't make it inflationary at all. Inflation isn't based on supply increasing, it's based on the equilibrium between supply and demand
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:40:20
There is definitely a difference. If you save your Bitcoin, that money is not fueling the economy in any way. If you INVEST fiat currency (i.e. government bond), that money is being used to create jobs and build infrastructure. An incentive to hold onto your bitcoin and essentially remove it from the economy will absolutely hurt the economy. It could cause slowed investment, lower employment, and could result in a recession.
The issue is you can't combine currency with an investment. You need to use currency to BUY an investment, and then your currency will be used for economic activity. If you hold your bitcoin, that money is doing nothing.

Now you're undertaking logical fallacies to try and prove you won a debate, and blatantly disregarding my points about your cognitive errors ("I PROVED EVERYTHING YOU SAID WRONG...But we're going to ignore your valid criticisms...") - you should read up on cognitive and emotional biases in finance next time you're planning on building an argument on assumptions and opinions that you claim to be fact and logic. 
Copper is not gold, Rai stones are not like USD, but USD is like bitcoin - didn't think I'd have to really come out and say that but you're focusing on irrelevant arguments as a way to again "win" the argument. Let's get back on track, shall we?
USD is a substitute for Bitcoin, a GOOD substitute for bitcoin (there, does that help?). It can buy more stuff than Bitcoin, it doesn't need to be the exact same to be a substitute. This clearly stands as an issue for Bitcoin since there is something that can replicate most of its functionality. And other cryptos are good substitutes, if not replacements, for bitcoin as well - what can you do with Bitcoin that you can't with at least one other crypto? You can't honestly look at everything else and claim "nope, NONE of these pose any threat to bitcoin"... talk about putting your fingers in your ears...
Again you're ignoring very real issues with Bitcoin and STILL using rhetoric to contest in a debate. You need to focus on more financial theory than metaphors, confirmation bias and flawed analogies to prove your point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:18:10
If you're claiming it is undervalued, than how much is bitcoin worth?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:23:28
It gains MARKET value from that, but not INTRINSIC value. Intrinsic value is not affected by speculative demand.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:23:40
That just means you’re spending USD. If you net out your actions (aka getting bitcoin, spending bitcoin), you’re left with converting money into bitcoin, which again means you probably assume it will earn you a return over time. And my point is just that if you assume that it will earn a return (particularly a high one), than you will be incentivized not to use it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:29:45
I agree, but if Bitcoin was adopted, and did earn a passive return, than spending would slow, and people would naturally lose jobs. You can't have an economy with less spending AND strong economic activity. And I think that's a trade off people won't make to adopt bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:32:53
And yet it's not storing value... if I bought it at $19,000, I would be down over $10,000. It can't be a good store of value with this volatility

I wish I could share this with half of the people I'm arguing with right now...great point!
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:27:12
That rhetoric has no backing. You don't know anything about the future of Bitcoin, telling yourself otherwise is a disservice to yourself and your own financial affairs.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:34:03
I agree that people can have different needs and what not, but my argument is that for bitcoin to be worth its risk in return, it needS to offer people a high return. And a high return will incentivize people not to use it. It’s not a few percentage points here - at its height bitcoin was up over 2000% annually. I guess my point is that bitcoin cannot offer a high return (which is needed to justify its risk) AND operate as a functional currency. You can’t pretend there’s no incentive to not spend here that would be more prevalent than with USD - it would have to slow demand for common goods
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:43:00
That's fair, and I agree that overtime people who truly support Bitcoin are investing money, regardless of the outcome, to help it grow. Thing is, mixing that with people making money leads to fanaticism. If we see growth in Bitcoin driven by its true users, it won't be a significant return and probably won't garner any headlines.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:53:07
That just means they're spending USD - if you net out the spending and buying back bitcoin, you end up with just spending USD

Classifying a whole profession as assholes &gt;.&gt;
But regardless, it’s bad because it encourage people to not use their money. Think about it, if you replace investing with just holding bitcoin, you kill economic activity. When you invest, your money is being used to expand business, when your money is under a mattress, it does nothing. You can’t gain wealth from nothing, it has to come from somewhere
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:45:37
That is taking for granted our current economic position. A lower spending rate will lead to unemployment and a vicious cycle of lower spending = unemployment = lower spending. Not to mention, having a currency that subs as an investment will remove billions from investments, which will only amplify this effect.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:30:26
Alright then let’s go into financial discussion:
- Debt is at an all time high. We claim that a deflationary currency will benefit society, but deflation works at both ends. If you argue that deflation will earn a return for those who hold it, it’s also making their debt more expensive. Every mortgage, credit card balance, etc. would become more of a burden to households. Given this concern, how will bitcoin justify its use when it will clearly hurt many households with debt?
- do you believe the return earned by bitcoin is real or nominal? How would this look if bitcoin was widely adopted? How would the economy manage deflationary costs while implementing bitcoin.
- how would pricing work in an economy with a growing bitcoin value? Would companies change prices to adjust? What are the costs of doing this?
I have my views on these points but you can go ahead and discuss your views. Let’s not devolve into trolling this time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:57:45
I understood it as being about the price performance we've seen, not theoretical price implications

Careful, friend, that’s been said in every bubble we’ve seen
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:37:37
Ah, finally some meat to debate.
Firstly, let's set common ground that I agree with most of your statements, they are based on basic economic concepts. Where I disagree is the weighting of certain benefits and costs. For example, I put much more weight on the costs associated with price adjustments. These costs (i.e. the sticky wages, menu costs, etc.) are an economic inefficiency. Sure, if Bitcoin was adopted to its fullest capacity this would slow down, but I'd argue it would still be more than the cost we see with fiat, given the lack of monetary control.
I also still think that there's a huge gap between now and market saturation. In essence, my argument is that the merits of bitcoin may not outweigh the costs of implementation (as you mention, it may actually have a net negative effect on the economy, depending on your measure). So we have a tradeoff, one system that works, and another system that could be better, but that has upfront costs (net negative impact initially) and could consistently operate on a deflationary basis, something that based on traditional economic theory would lead to high costs. I guess I don't think most people would willingly undergo that conversion - even if people keep progressively using crypto currency, regulation could dramatically cut off demand at any time. Take my own view, for example. I'm fine with fiat - I don't pay for my transactions or transfers, don't travel much and have had all my needs satisfied with fiat. Why would I support any change with an upfront cost of implementation?
The core of my stance is simply that I don't think we can have an effective, deflationary currency when we have a low inflation currency already in place. Obviously we can disagree here, but that's my stance.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:09:54
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:15:39
But then why not just do that with derivatives and other real assets backed by something of monetary value? Hell, why not do that with USD? It's much more stable than Bitcoin. And that still leads to an incentive not to use Bitcoin since its earning a return, if you keep that assumption.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:06:29
Of course, but people who own it need to be aware of the risks and issues with it. Too many people are ignorant to the fundamental risks they face
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:28:07
It's not a false dilemma, it's a matter of incentives. If I told you "Hey, if you don't buy anything this week, I'll give you $1M," you'd be incentivized not to buy anything. You can't argue that someone with that incentive will act the same as someone without it. My point is that Bitcoin can't be an effective currency if you also have that incentive to hold.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:38:39
Right, assumption 1 is not
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:15:09
I don't know if I agree with your point, namely I don't think we have any examples of stronger economies with low employment. And deflation isn't caused by economic growth, typically inflation is the result of economic growth. Additionally, deflation and inflation both hurt the economy - there are costs associated with both, so deflation would in fact cause inefficiencies in the market, possibly worse than inflation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:24:23
I don't understand how TMV applies to your argument. Your last point demonstrated TMV, but how is Bitcoin involved in that? People don't keep their money in T-Bills because they are low return, low risk, and they aren't a currency you spend like Bitcoin. Not to mention a huge part of TMV is risk, which Bitcoin is very high in. In fact, Bitcoin's PV would probably be very low given its volatility - the volatility would lead to a high discount rate, thereby significantly reducing the value of future cash flows you would see by holding bitcoin.
My point is you can't have a sustainable economy that would operate solely on Bitcoin. It's a simplifying argument, but it pokes holes in the arguments people use to suggest that Bitcoin is a great investment and that it will be the currency of the future.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:17:30
You're talking about buying necessities, but when it comes to luxuries, yes it will absolutely influence spending behaviour. And limiting the purchase of non-necessity goods (think tvs, etc.), a slowing demand will lower economic growth, leading to unemployment and overall a recession.
And you can't argue that the year to year volatility of bitcoin is stable - how many years of data are you basing that off of? If something swings by 20% on the daily, that's a volatile instrument, it doesn't really matter if the annual data averages out because throughout that year people had to withdraw and deposit into that thing, making it a poor store of value.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:12:15
If bitcoin remains this volatile for even a few years I guarantee we won't see it to year 100. And I would argue that demand will never stabilize - on the one side, any economic fluctuation will directly impact the value of the currency as supply will not be able to adjust and "soften the blow." On the other side, demand for money is always rising with population growth - if you fix supply, price can't really stabilize.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:04:23
Damn I think you just discovered the super power of foresight!
I hope you don't actually believe that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:45:14
But economists who don't understand Bitcoin likely aren't using it as a currency/investment. Computer programmers who understand Bitcoin are using it as a currency/investment without understanding the financial implications. I'd argue that the latter are at higher risk
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:43:00
I disagree that Bitcoin is a GOOD store of value, given how much volatility its demonstrated. That volatility will not likely subside since nothing backs the value of crypto, leaving it totally susceptible to speculation. A store of value also typically doesn't earn a sizable return overtime.
In terms of it being isolated from unstable government currencies, that's more or less what the USD is being used for, and I think areas where governments have unstable currencies are likely to see the toughest crackdown on crypto use.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:40:30
That goes back to using bitcoin as a currency - it still doesn't address the economic implications of having something with high return and that operates as a currency. It's not sustainable to have both.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:01:10
I don't really understand your point, all I'm saying is you SHOULD understand both, and people with money invested who only understand one side of it are taking on a huge risk. You should understand the financial implications of something if you're going to tie your money to it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:57:51
So by incentivizing people not to invest, we'll take money away from all the bad business ventures and only have good investments?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:15:59
So you're telling me that a currency's value, or changes in the value, have NO impact on demand for goods?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:29:52
Those are fair points, I guess my follow up is can those uses of Bitcoin exist in a sustainable manner if Bitcoin is earning a return over time?
*edit* I think the issue I see is that we're still using Bitcoin as a currency in these cases, but just jumping through technical loopholes. So my concern goes back to the return assumption.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:58:20
If you had any experience with investments prior to bitcoin you would understand that 2000% is not sustainable, that it can't be from the merits on bitcoin alone. By the way, Bitcoin lost just under 20% of its value today...so I'd hold off using its "awesomeness" as a pro to your argument.
And you can't have something that's high risk AND that has absolute outcomes... all of these statements that "bitcoin will become more stable when we reach saturation..." big issue with that statement is that the when is more of an if, and a HUGE if at that, one that relies on a perfect implementation without regulatory meddling.
And deflationary currency is not a paradox, but a currency that offers strong REAL returns is. There's a difference between nominal and real return...
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:22:14
To your point about banks making money by doing nothing at all, that's what the bitcoin model offers as well (again, if you assume it will earn you a return). Your money is not invested, it's not being used to create anything or produce any economic activity; as you hold it, it's removed from the economy, yet you earn a return for doing nothing. I don't think our economy can operate on that.
Secondly, again, my argument is bitcoin cannot earn a great return and be a stable currency. If bitcoin was widely adopted, sure you'd still buy food, but what about the stuff that you don't need? Maybe you'll buy one shirt a year instead of ten because you don't want to lose that great return. Bitcoin will still deflate demand for many goods in the same way that increasing prices would deflate demand, which is why it can't really be a functional currency in my eyes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:02:05
It just means that the value of the currency is increasing over time. In other words, prices are lowering, making it easier to buy stuff. This can be bad though as it can be driven by low demand for goods, meaning companies need to continuously lower prices further to get business.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:29:15
Are you arguing that the boom bust cycle is driven by monetary policy exclusively?
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:05:36
So wait, now you're combining monetary policy with the loan business. The loan business will still exist with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:38:59
Not quite, part of the reason they buy it early is because in a years time the tech may be beaten by some other, faster phone
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:20:25
That point you make about Bitcoin being different may not be enough to justify the volatility and to lead to its widespread adoption. I think people overestimate how much people care about controlling their transactions. If you have data to prove otherwise, I'm all ears, but don't claim that that's what people want, because we'd need a lot of people to want that REALLY badly for Bitcoin to become widespread.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:53
Very well put!
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:01:20
I don’t see how you’re claiming to have won the argument, you’re still using rhetoric and now resorting to belittlement as a form of intimidation to prove that you’re...right?
USD is a substitute for bitcoin. You can use it to buy stuff, more stuff than bitcoin. That list of stuff you have prepared that you can do with Bitcoin, there’s a longer list for USD. If you have to convert bitcoin to usd to buy common goods, we’ll, you’re really using USD.
You’re still demonstrating a lot of cognitive and emotional error in your posts. Confirmation bias, representativeness, etc.
And hey, the sky is blue...geez I’m right now too, thank god I put some facts in here to prove my argument. That’s how this works, right?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:52:22
That's nothing in the realm of finance, not to mention it only gained mainstream attention in the last few years.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:30:20
Eh, your loss
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:12
Now you're arguing that switching to Bitcoin changes you spending philosophy or ethical stance
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:43:26
That last point is exactly it. When prices drop, currencies inherently become more valuable.
It's more complicated than a linear relationship to demand - currency value is influenced by prevailing interest rates, exchange rates, and other factors, but that's a very simplified explanation 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:07:20
That second point you mentioned involves using bitcoin as a currency though. If you completely remove that functionality (i.e. you can only convert into and out of Bitcoin, you cannot transact it), than Bitcoin is nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:22:05
Lower spending absolutely leads to lower employment - if people aren't buying goods and services, companies can't afford to hire as many people.
And I don't know if I agree with your second point. If you assume Bitcoin is an investment, than it by itself is incredibly inefficient.
When you invest fiat currency, that money is being used to fuel economic activity, whether a company sells you a bond to expand its business or you buy a stock from an IPO. If you hold bitcoin (to hold the passive return), that money is not fueling economic activity in any way. You've essentially removed it from the economy. How is that efficient?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:14:20
Right, and my point is that both assumptions can't hold. So that raises an issue for anyone who believe in both of those points
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:35:11
I stand by the argument that 2000% is not sustainable (which, based on what came after, seems to be the case!) It's pricing bitcoin for perfection, when we have so many substitutes (USD) and cryptos that offer the same functionality - you can argue its a money upgrade, but that's your own view, I think the majority of the population doesn't see a need for change with USD use already being pretty convenient. This priced-for-perfection also fails to take into account the gravity of the forces with no interest in adopting bitcoin. I doubt the U.S. government will ever accept Bitcoin, and any regulation of it will dramatically lower its appeal to users. People argue that you can't stop people from using bitcoin, but you can certainly try to, and that will definitely put a ceiling on the value bitcoin can reach.
It would be ridiculous to assume that the spike in price we saw was driven by bitcoin's merits alone, without speculation and hype. After all if that were the case we wouldn't have seen the dramatic fall afterwards, as some speculators left the market. But you seem to argue that the 2000% annual return is repeatable, which I just can't agree with.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:54:55
Except that you may lose your life savings with bitcoin :/
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:27:52
In finance, you don't predict, you forecast with probabilities, and even that school of thought is widely criticized. Most people now just deal with risk tolerance - what are the risks, and can I bare them?
But I'm happy to be proven wrong, so what's bitcoin going to do tomorrow? Actually, I could use a week's forecast if you don't mind.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:27:26
Nothing you've said is fact or logic? This is the epitome of fanaticism - disregarding valid concerns with rhetoric. Get off your high horse of "I made money, therefore I'm right." People made plenty of money in 2008 before the crash, doesn't mean they made good decisions.
And how can you argue that the USD is not a substitute for bitcoin? You're joking right? Regardless of the technology, the security, whatever, they have the exact same use... how is that not a substitute?
You can pretend like my views are a regression but you're being pretty arrogant with your own opinions and putting way more merit in them than is warranted. You're doing a disservice to your own finances by getting caught up in your cognitive errors.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:00:29
I'm not saying the economy is run on wasteful spending, but you're saying two different things. I'm saying overall demand for goods will decrease if people are incentivized to hold their currency. That will absolutely hurt the economy - not demand for a few tvs, but demand for goods in general. That money is not being spent on other things, because its being, as you say, hoarded and somehow earning a passive return, even though its not being used for anything while its sitting unused.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:44
Right, but the whole Bitcoin craze came about for its use as an investment - people EARNED gains by getting into it early and using it for returns, not as a currency. My point is to question whether that violates its properties as a currency
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:37:03
I agree that the value could stabilize, but who's to say we aren't already at critical mass? I suppose I'm just challenging HODLers who are looking to earn massive returns from Bitcoin - I don't see it as a sustainable investment.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:00:23
Inflation absolutely encourages spending. Look at Zimbabwe - an extreme example, but so is Bitcoin. and to get to that level of saturation, you need that period of instability, that period where we face this paradox. I don't think the economy will willingly go through that period to reach that outcome, assuming a stable Bitcoin state is even possible.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:38
I just mean that that doesn’t address issues we’d see if bitcoin replaced USD for example. In this very simplified example, you don’t have USD to convert to bitcoin and spend. I’d argue that, with everyone holding bitcoin that’s earning a passive return, there would be less of an incentive to spend, and I think that inherently limits its capacity as a currency. Just my thoughts, though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:26:34
I think it's been too short of a time frame to argue that cryptos have proven their resilience
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:54:36
These are valid points, but I'm not sure if the upgrade to bitcoin is as black and white as the upgrade from mail to email. I'd also argue that, though you bring up an interesting point about self-interest, the excerpt of the short essay could apply to the past bubbles we've seen, and to me it seems more of an explanation of how virtuous cycles arise rather than why bitcoin makes sense as an investment. Take 2008 for example - sure MBS securities were getting risky, but banks were making a lot of money from them, so why would they stop selling mortgages and MBS securities? And the problem with that is it assumes that the growth is sustainable, that people in the future will always be willing to pay higher and higher prices for your thing, and that economic activity won't deteriorate as a result of your actions, but at some point valuations will be challenged (and if your a fundamentalist, you probably believe that bitcoin's intrinsic value as a code on the computer is 0). I think a lot of bubbles arise from that sort of market behaviour, the snow ball effect of "FOMO" (fear of missing out... yes I'm using that as a finance term now). I'll also admit that its hard to know what will happen with a currency bubble since we haven't had one before.
BUT, again, most of the argument goes back to my core assumption that deflation is bad. In an economy with high deflation (and inflation for that matter) things need to continuously adjust, leading to many lapses when buyers are paying too much or too little for certain goods. If bitcoin were widely adopted, its ongoing deflation would not produce any real return, only nominal, which doesn't benefit anyone.
I think we also diverge in our belief on when Bitcoin needs to prove its merits. Right now, with Bitcoin's volatility, I don't think it makes sense to adopt as a currency - I'm not going to take the risk of putting $1000 in now when it could fall to $800 tomorrow. And I don't believe the future possibility of it being stable is enough to garner adoption. I think its volatility is too much to be accepted as a currency. You believe there is a path of gradual adoption that will lead to its wide spread use, and that's fine, but I disagree there.
Happy to leave it at differing opinions - regardless, we'll both be watching closely the next few years.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:22:41
I disagree that bitcoin is backed by transaction fees. If I own a Bitcoin, I don't get transaction fees. If I own a stock of a company, that stocks value is backed by the company's profits because those profits actually go to the shareholders.

I actually heard a point from a colleague about this though. Having an appreciating currency actually increases the burden of debt you owe. If we were to adopt a deflating currency, that would dramatically hurt people with mortgages and other large debts.
It’s not that I think people don’t deserve the money they earned, but I think you can’t have money appreciating while it sits around doing nothing, removes from economic activity. When you invest, the money is being used by a company while you gain a return. That’s not the case for bitcoin. Again, these views are based on my education in economics and finance and I admit that those rules can change, I just don’t know if bitcoins the thing that will set new rules

Fair point, and I can agree with the last point - which is why I wouldn't hold my money in Bitcoin. I'd rather wait and see from the sidelines, rather than taking on the massive risk. If Bitcoin becomes widely adopted and stabilizes, I probably won't miss out on return I'm not already earning with other investments by switching in late. My concern is how people still view Bitcoin as a investment.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:51:55
This is fanatic rhetoric. Pointing at big institutions and calling foul doesn't make Bitcoin a good investment. And Bitcoin still being around isn't a huge feat in the world of finance. Enron existed for 15 years before its scandals were uncovered. Nortel Networks was around for 8 years after it went bankrupt, I don't think anyone was standing by the wreckage claiming "but it's still here!"
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:02:08
It's not a bad thing, but it kind of proves that bitcoin is not valuable as a currency. If it were, than people wouldn't be hodling it, they'd be spending it.
I'm not saying people need to spend all of it to prove this point, but you can't have an investment and a currency in one unit. The two serve different purposes

Clearly we have very different fundamental economic views. On the one hand, deflation is terrible in my eyes - just google the costs of deflation for more. On the other, supply means nothing without the intersecting demand. The reason economic activity leads to inflation is because economic activity boosts demand, which shifts the demand curve right, which leads to high quantity and price on the supply curve. I taught that exact example in many economics workshops in university, so I’m basing my assumptions on traditional economic theory.

I work in investments I'm very familiar with TMV haha, it does not resolve it. That's like arguing that it makes sense to spend everything that earns a return because of TMV.

I understand your point, but my argument is you can't get to that end state without encountering this paradox. In order for Bitcoin to be widely adopted, it needs people to use it, which people aren't incentivized to do because it's early days and there's a potential for return.

But ARE people consuming with their Bitcoin's? Everywhere you look you see messages of HODL

I should have clarified I don’t believe in the two assumptions, that’s my point. And I agree we have no idea where it’ll be in 10 years, so I don’t think it’s a good investment for that reason. It’s a total gamble, not a great investment
