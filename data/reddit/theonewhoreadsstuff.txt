This morning I saw them touting bitcoin on Fox News.  It’s getting pretty popular.   
With that being the case, with its rise in popularity and value, couldn’t there be some sort of problem with it in the future?  For instance, inflation.  We are flooding economies with a secondary currency (actually multiple other (ether, lite etc)).  Would this not eventually weaken the dollar, As now we are putting money on top of money that isn’t tied to anything of tangible value and isn’t regulated?  
Maybe this is the wrong place for this discussion, but it occurred to me this morning after seeing the smug cunts on fox and friends mentioning BTC.  And please don’t take this as me shitting on crypto currency, I’m just curious, has anyone discussed this before?

Yeah guys, hook me up with some bit coin.  
I thought about getting into it, but I don't have the hardware to mine the stuff.  At any rate, I looked into it like three years ago.  Must be super hard to get the stuff now.
Edit:  Another point.  What good does giving it away do?  I understand that bringing more people into the game makes it more popular and increases the perceived value, but I feel like the investment in time and resources might be a huge hurdle to keeping people interested.  Maybe im missing something here.

Fine.  May your streets always be full of potholes, and may you have packs of rabbid dogs roaming your streets.
