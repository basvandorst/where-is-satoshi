If their multisig hot wallet held 0.5% of customer funds we are all good, that means Bitfinex still has over 23,000,000 BTC. Curious how they can have more Bitcoin than will ever exist...

You don't seem to get that the potential damages are 0 to Coinbase here. Yes you found a bug, no you can't withdraw more than you own to an external address. You got five grand. Stop bitching on the internet and go out for dinner or something.

Are you sure we aren't already at that point? Given the discussions I've seen over the last six months it doesn't seem like there will ever be consensus for a hard fork even today.

I'm in the same boat. Withdrawals to my bank account seem to not be working. Heard back within 24 hours, but no resolution yet.

I invested some in GAW earlier this year when their prime hashlet product was released at $16/MH. At the time the estimated time to break even from mining was about 60-90 days. The price per hashlet jumped several times until it hit $50/MH, say which point everything at GAW started to smell. I cashed out for a nice profit and walked away, but anyone who got in after has been royally screwed.

If there becomes miner and economic consensus (fork occurs, exchanges offer support, users switch wallet) do you not think that the core devs will merge the changes to core? The idea that someone other than core devs can't lead a protocol change/fork with majority support is ridiculous.
In addition the concept that any hard fork that is not initiated from core is an 'altcoin' is ridiculous. If it has the same Genesis block, and the longest chain with the most work done it is Bitcoin.

Unfortunately OP likely reflects the sentiment of many non technical and non developers in the crypto space. Those people are crucially important to the success of bitcoin because they are the ones that need to be won over that it is a viable technology and something to be interested in. The strife and bickering within the community is not helping that cause, and I am starting to agree that this had gone on too long. We need a solution, and we need it soon or we are going to start losing users.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:08:02
Yes, move it immediately. If you do not control the keys, it is not your Bitcoin. There is no reason to hold funds on an exchange if you aren't actively trading.

How is Segwit2x an altcoin? Wasn't that the compromise that has led to a scaling solution (bip91 etc etc)? Segwit activates, then 2MB blocks after. What makes it an altcoin?

I got a similar questionnaire from Circle a few months ago after I made a large BTC deposit and USD withdrawal. They are following the law. If you want to exchange BTC for cash you can use localbitcoins but you are going to pay a large premium for the anonymity.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:35:04
Thanks, I was hoping someone would post this. People get all nuts about Coinbase following the laws, when in fact much of their success is due to their willingness to do so.

Please do not use blockchain.info. Use a respectable wallet where you own the private keys.

This isn't Bitcoin specific. If I walked into my bank and deposited or withdrew large sums of cash on a regular basis, I would get similar questions.

Which is why I was fine providing Circle the required information and move along. Unfortunately it comes with the territory of moving a large sum of money legally. On the flip side it does help combat money laundering.
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:01:56
Sorry, but this is bullshit. Bitcoin will never become mainstream if people see it as skirting and avoiding the law. KYC/AML exist for a reason and all financial institutions have to follow them. Bitcoin itself doesn't matter if there is no way to convert it to and from fiat.

Hence the 51% attack? If someone maintained &gt; 51% of hashing power for long enough they could eventually catch up and manipulate transactions?

USAA has never given me any issues, in fact they are a major investor in Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-08-22 12:18:24
No, there was a requirement to register a VISA to allow instant buy in case your ACH bounced. There was no way to explicitly use that card to purchase BTC
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:16:01
Relating this back to the BIP 66 issues currently going on - are these zero tx blocks because they are only mining on headers and so if they solve a block very quickly after the previous they don't know if the transactions in the mempool are in the previous block or not? Would forcing the full validation of blocks before publishing a new block prevent this from happening, allowing the mempool to clear out?
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:11:21
Isn't this extra time to transmit somewhere in the range of milliseconds? Does that really add up to significant increases in blocks mined over time?

Well, Ammann &amp; Partner is at the address OP visited, as per the registration. I don't really see anything wrong here.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:01:30
Probably because Gemini pays tx fees on withdrawals. Seems like the OP was taking advantage of this to avoid having to pay them himself when splitting into many smaller transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:12:23
Yeah... With multiple wallets of 5-10 BTC it would be multiple thousands of dollars in tx fees to split into chunks of 0.02, especially if they are using high priority fees. If that's the case I totally understand them giving him the boot.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:07:19
So is 'User activated soft fork' really kinda a misnomer? It does requirer miners to go along with it. Why should we expect the miners to behave differently than they are now? Isn't it in their best interest to avoid a chain split?
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:15:16
Thanks for the great explanation. Now I have a few more questions.
Is there a time limit that a channel can be open? If not, what will stop people from permanantly locking their funds into lightning network and never settling to the blockchain? This would effectively get rid of the need for bitcoin transactions all together. That doesn't seem healthy for the bitcoin ecosystem. I can foresee the reward from mined blocks immediately fed into LN and it never leaving.
If opening a channel sends funds to a multi signature address, how does a single party decide to close it? If this was 2-of-2 multisig it would require both parties to agree to send from it. If it is 2-of-3, who holds the third key required to send funds back? I.e. what protects someone from their funds being held hostage from the other party in the channel?
Who stores the transactions that take place within lightning and gets paid for confirming/processing them? Will people have to run a lightning node alongside a bitcoin client/node, that will then store a significant amount of data? 
Bitcoin has a lot of resources for understanding how it works and is very well documented at this point. I understand a lot of the technical aspects of it. Is there any similar sort of resource for understanding lightning as it seems to be a very complicated concept?

Welcome to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:33:23
Right but say you have two miners, A and B. A is signaling for Segwit and B isn't. Once the UASF client activates, A mines a block and B mines a block on top of it. B is rejected by your client then A mines a block on top of B's block. The block A just mined is invalid because it is mined on top of a block that UASF client doesn't think exists. The UASF client is now permanently stuck on block 1 mined by miner A. How is that supposed to work? The miners won't know that Segwit is supposed to be activated because they are going on 95% of miners signaling.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:02:41
Huh? This is completely wrong. The entire campaign of BU has been to increase the block size. My understanding is that Segwit moves signature data outside the block, freeing up space in the block for more transactions. The actual block is still 1MB with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:21:12
Wallet software already does this. This would be pretty useless for a lot of people in a block explorer because anyone that uses an HD wallet gets a new receiving address each time they get a transaction. The fee is based on the number of inputs, which could come from many different addresses.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:26:21
At what point does it become necessary? Transaction backlog is at an all time high, this is real people's money stuck in limbo because there is not enough capacity to handle the demands of the users anymore. I'm all for a Segwit+2mb compromise. I think Segwit provides awesome new capabilities and the 2MB will allow the continued growth of the network and on chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:54:38
or someone else, can you explain how this transaction is then written to the blockchain? My understanding is that the channel has to be closed, and then a corresponding transaction is posted for the net amount. Doesn't that corresponding transaction have to pay fees? What is the benefit of this other than being able to make multiple transactions with the same person off chain, and what prevents the funds being sent over lightning from being spent on the blockchain simultaneously?

I think it also should be noted that the people posting and commenting on r/Bitcoin and r/btc together are likely not a majority of Bitcoin users in general and that many users are totally unaware of all the drama going on between these two subs and on Twitter.
