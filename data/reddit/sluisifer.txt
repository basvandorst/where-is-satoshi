The fact is that Eth is still a PoW coin and Bitcoin remains the most secure PoW network.  The DAO fork is an extreme blackmark on the community and arguably compromises any claims to decentralization.
I like Vitalik and would love to see him pull off PoS, and I'm generally bullish on ETH, but don't lose sight of reality.  Retail doesn't matter at all for crypto at this point, and the differences for scaling PoW coins are trivial.

To reiterate for anyone that's unclear, you *never* use a private key or seed that *anyone* else could have conceivably had access to.  If you actually got a seed from a hardware wallet manufacturer, you would simply be hoping they didn't take your money from you, pretty please.
Honestly, let Coinbase or whatever hold your coins if you don't understand how this all works.  It's honestly going to be safer for some people.

I don't think that's a reasonable assumption at all.  Speaking around 2014, most interest seemed to revolve around speculation, remittances, and as a hedge against various fiat currencies.  The Greek situation was very popular, for instance, much like Venezuela has been more recently.
Retail and micro-transactions were more popular in discussions very early in Bitcoin, and even then many were critical.  The difficulty of scaling Bitcoin was entirely evident back in 2010, as clearly seen in Jeff Garzik's infamous "[PATCH] increase block size limit" thread.
To suggest that the scaling issues were difficult to predict is to be willfully ignorant of the Bitcoin development process.  This has been front-and-center from the very beginning.  It's all there for anyone to read, and anyone currently involved in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies owes it to themselves to become very familiar with the development history.   is a good starting point.
I want to present you a different interpretation of the events that have transpired.  In my view, the November 2013 bubble was a critical proof of the technology.  It demonstrated several facts, namely that Bitcoin was secure, even with large financial incentives to compromise the network.  It demonstrated that there were many parties willing to invest in mining equipment and to treat Bitcoin mining as a professional endeavor.  It demonstrated that investors would warm up to the idea and that there was a ready speculative market for investing.  It also demonstrated that many of the early adopters were 'firm hands' that would not readily part with their coins.
In the wake of the bubble topping out, none of these facts changed.  The price corrected severely, but the fundamentals of the technology remained in place.  If anything, one could see that interest was piqued and that plans were beginning to set in motion that could carry the network forward.  Nakamoto consensus was and is the core innovation; you don't have to predict the ways that it will be utilized to understand that it's likely to see valuable application.  Bitcoin did and does work, and no observation is more surprising and valuable than that.  If anything, Gox and Willy gave us a premature glimpse of the future.
That's what caused me to catch the falling knife.  There were plenty of ways it could have gone wrong, but the upside was enormous.  None of the FUD was compelling in the way that Bitcoin was a truly novel and compelling technology.  The situation remains the same today.


I didn't predict *this* particular outcome.  I didn't have to.  All of this is noise, all the drama and fighting.  And the price is also quite noisy; I had predicted 3-5 years for the next major bull market.  I was off by a bit, instead taking about 2 to start.  At certain points, I was down a fair amount, too; it's not about picking bottoms.  It's about realizing that Nakamoto-type networks are inevitable, and Bitcoin was and is sufficiently good to become the preeminent implementation.

Mining energy use is in direct proportion to mining rewards.  Put another way, if mining produces 1 million in coinbase rewards and transaction fees a day, then energy costs can be calculated as
    1,000,000 - amortized cost of capital - profits = value of energy used
Mining rewards (coinbase rewards) are currently vastly higher than they will be in the future.  The network is bootstrapped with these early rewards, which halve over time.  Eventually, the value of energy used will be in direct proportion to transaction fees.
Another issue is that traditional networks (banks, visa, fiat currency) is far more expensive than many people realize.  It's an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people globally, with enormous energy expenditure.  I think it's ultimately foolish to compare the two because it's so difficult to estimate with accuracy, but this should not be overlooked.
Finally, there are some fun market dynamics that come out of Bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin can be mined anywhere, and thus take advantage of cheap electricity.  Energy infrastructure is often inelastic; a wind or solar plant has fixed capital and operational costs.  If you have 10MW of demand now, but expect 30MW of demand in 20 years, you build a 30MW plant.  So how do you make up the difference?  You sell electricity for less, and some goes to waste.  Bitcoin provides demand for electricity in these remote areas, making these infrastructure projects pay off more quickly, and thus can incentive green energy projects.  This is absolutely happening in China.  To what degree is very difficult to say, but it's noteworthy that production and demand will never be in perfect alignment.  If Bitcoin can serve as arbitrage, it is very much in line with sustainable energy development.
The other aspect is that any cryptocurrency that is based on proof-of-work is going to have security in *exact* proportion to energy use.  The cost of an attack will always be directly proportional to the value of securing the network, i.e. mining rewards.  It doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever.  The only way this could change is a proof-of-stake system.  Such a system may be developed, but it is *far* from clear that it can be done.

Nah, he could sign a message about plans to sell over time, etc.  It would affect the market, but manageable.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:14
It really depends on how you did  it.  If you just bought on one exchange, it's pretty easy to figure out the capital gains on each buy.  If you trade, it gets a bit more tricky; now you have to figure out FIFO, how long each 'unit' was held and tax accordingly, etc.
State taxes naturally depend on where you live.
You can look into doing it yourself, but at a certain point you might decide that a professional is worth it.

It's not really finding diamonds in the rough so much as taking advantage of the opportunities presented to you.
If you had some spare money in 2009-2011 and could invest in real estate, that was a great bet for a lot of people.  I don't think it was at all controversial then to say it was a buying opportunity, but the issue was that most people couldn't afford to do it at that time.
For Bitcoin, the opportunity was 1) that you knew enough about technology to have heard of it at all 2) that you had some money to invest (the overlap between awareness of Bitcoin and student debt is quite high) and 3) it fit your risk appetite at the time.  That's a fairly limited set of people, but if that was you, I think it was a very reasonable investment.  Certainly no guarantee, but reasonable enough.

That's true, but why should they be privileged?  So far, they happen to have advantages that make mining more profitable, namely cheap electricity.  If, however, the network begins to value network access more, then other places should now have an advantage.  Why should users be withheld the advantages of greater network throughput/latency/etc.?
The mining market must remain competitive for greatest user utility.
There are reasonable concerns about centralization in Bitcoin, but I think the network has to stand on its own two feet.  If the design is incapable of remaining decentralized without crippling utility, then it is inherently flawed.  For instance, perhaps a dearth of full nodes is a tragedy of the commons.

* Incentive to spend is less because holding currency increases buying power in the future relative to the present.
* Debt is far more expensive.  If you get a loan and produce a return, that goes to paying interest and taking a profit.  In the case of inflation, interest rates are low because sitting on money results in losing some to inflation.  Better to get even 0.1% return if you can.  In the case of deflation, money appreciates while doing nothing, so the interest must be greater than deflation.  Furthermore, paying back the loan is done in the future were the effects of deflation have kicked in, so getting the same unit of currency requires more value in exchange.
It's very hard to reason about this, though, because *so many* aspects of the economy change in such a scenario.  My overall fear is that it exacerbates the return of capital, making r &gt; g an even bigger problem than it currently is.

Yeah, people need to chill a bit.  Sure, we're not 6 months from solving scalability with LN, but I don't doubt they can release some working code by then.
Ultimately, something like LN increases the value of Bitcoin by enabling a new category of use-cases for Bitcoin.  Even if you assume something like BIP101 scaling, micropayments seem unlikely to fit into that.  Feel free to call people out saying, "we don't need bigger blocks because of LN," but try to keep some perspective.

21 is making chips and software focusing on bitcoin.  The chip does have a little miner, basically as a way of easily collecting some satoshis.  Obviously it won't be efficient, and many doubt the practicality relative to just seeding the device, but it's what they're doing.
I think the vision is kinda IoT with 21 chips on them, able to engage in interactions with other devices, using the blockchain where needed, etc.  Your imagination can kinda go wild with it.  There also seems to be a big focus on DAO stuff, and perhaps something like Open Bazaar.
In the short term, it seems like they'll be making some really nice APIs for developers to mess around with Bitcoin-enabled software.  I don't think 21 is necessary for this at all, but they're putting out the code.

I don't know about anyone else, but personally I did because you won't shut up about it.  Spamming the thread with 8 comments about how it might not be the bitcoin blockchain isn't productive.  It's poor Reddiquette, and it's clear you're not open to alternative views.
Regarding the substance of the argument, of course it's a possibility that Bitcoin will fall out of favor for one reason or another, while virtual currencies live on.  No reasonable person denies that, but that's not the same thing as being likely.
First, what's the value proposition?  A big bank, like you're suggesting, might want this, but why would other banks?  Either the new blockchain privileges some parties, in which case adoption would be difficult, or it is fair, in which case Bitcoin is perfectly applicable.  You either use an extant secure system, or attempt to create your own for ... reasons?
There are top-down arguments, where the financial elite collectively realize that Bitcoin empowers the masses, but such arguments require widespread collusion.  I call this the Illuminati argument.  While powerful parties most certainly do collude, the way this occurs is very particular.  It happens when parties have the means and motive, and it's far from clear that this would be the case.  
A much more parsimonious explanation, in my view, is that it's much more politically palatable for companies to talk about the blockchain rather than Bitcoin.  Thus, they avoid talking about Bitcoin, but when it comes to choosing a blockchain, they'll be pragmatic and choose the most secure one.
Or not, it's all speculation.  I'm just not convinced that it's a particularly strong concern.

I don't think this is similar at all.  There's no centralized party that's determining what gets prioritized.  This is more like simply paying more for a better connection.
Let's say someone hosts a torrent and makes it cheaply available.  That's their prerogative, and lets them distribute that information more easily, thus prioritizing it.  This is no different from Steam or Facebook getting better servers and better connections to serve files better.  The internet has never been neutral in the sense that some shitty old server on DSL is as fast as a modern datacenter on fiber.
Someone could also decide to charge a great deal to distribute a torrent.  In this case, anyone else could pay that amount, and then host the torrent for a lesser amount.  If there is sufficient demand, this would be profitable.  Therefore, I don't see a mechanism where content can be restricted by a given party.
There is no central party that can privately profit for prioritizing content.  There's nothing about net neutrality here.

Not really.  You're on the right track; buyer and seller protection are valuable, and do cost money to implement.
What we need isn't credit cards, though.  We need escrow and mediation services that can perform the function of chargebacks, etc. and we need competition in this space.
The market seems ripe for innovation.  Paypal's chargeback and mediation process is easy for buyers to game and is biased by their own fee incentivization.  They cater to buyers because, in the end, they make more money that way.  A service dedicated just to escrow and mediation could have an elaborate rating/counter-rating system, clever fraud detection, etc.  They could work with shipping services, for example, to confirm delivery (confirm package delivered, recipient can decide if they require a signature, etc.).  There's a huge potential here, and the best part is that barriers to entry are low.  It's pretty easy to set up a bitcoin escrow service, and there are lots of smaller specialized markets that allow for new entrants to gain a foothold.  A small fraud-prone community (trading cards, collectables, antiques, etc.) will actively seek out better options and start using them.

If it's constant, where is the value coming from?  I can imagine lots of ways to determine Bitcoin's value, but none of them are constant.
Initially, the value was an idea with potential.  Perhaps it even had value as a novelty, or an ideological allure for decentralization.
Since then, it's speculative value has grown immensely.  This is being driven by two forces.  One is the bubble pattern and strong logarithmic growth trend.  The second is more substantive: the prediction that the value will be very high in the future.
Bitcoin's potential value comes from many places.  The most obvious is as a medium of exchange.  Transferring value is, in itself, incredibly valuable: it's the finance industry.  I just can't imagine what mental gymnastics you'd have to do to think otherwise.  Bitcoin clearly has the potential to augment, replace parts of, or otherwise be involved in finance.  That's where it's ultimate value comes from, and the ceiling on the value is extraordinarily high.
I think all this is quite obvious, but it's clearly at odds with the idea that Bitcoin's value is constant.
As for the hoarders, I don't see how this affects Bitcoin any differently than it affects any other equity.  The whales have the ability to crash the price, but they do so at their own peril.  Slow sell-offs are incentivized.   You could make an argument that those earlier wallets are amateurish, but to some degree that's offset or mitigated by the amount of Bitcoins that are forever lost.

It's interesting, but I think the author is confusing mining operations with mining pools.  I'm not aware of any single mining operation coming anywhere close to majority of hashing power.  I'd be surprised if a single operation approached double-digit percentages, but perhaps I'm wrong about that.
A mining pool may achieve a majority, but individual miners are free to enter or leave as they like.  From the perspective of a miner, doesn't it seem risky to enter a majority pool that's behaving as a monopoly?  They could simply kick you out of the pool at a whim and you'd be powerless.  Thus, I think miners would collectively decide to leave a pool that was pursuing a monopoly strategy.

If an escrow service just sides with the buyer or seller, they'll quickly get a reputation as scum from the other side, so it won't be accepted.  It's only accepted if both parties agree.  There are strong incentives to find a fair escrow service.
I'm not saying the system will be perfect, but the incentives are in the right places.  It easily allows new entrants, whereas there are significant barriers to entry in the current system.
You can imagine some really cool systems where you have distributed physical confirmations.  Other users of a system could verify (in person, over video chat, etc.) that a package is being shipped in the described condition.  There are lots of technological solutions to these problems.

Paypal ultimately provides a sort of escrow or arbitrage service.  They deal with claims for refunds, etc.  They also make it easier for individuals to accept credit card payments.
If they utilize bitcoin, the former service will still be in place, with a fee accordingly.  The latter service will be redundant (anyone with a wallet can accept bitcoins).  Furthermore, the credit card companies would no longer get a slice of the pie.
What this means is that the fees should go down, but the convenience and arbitrage services may still attract some customers with a fee (I think it's likely other services will outcompete paypal, but for some time this should be true).  If their fees remain the same, a competitor should quickly replace them.
It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.

It'll start with internet companies and the like taking coins.  I'd bet that places like Bandcamp will begin accepting them sooner or later, and that's starting to get to where you can start spending a decent amount of coins on stuff you actually want.
It'll be a while before e.g. Amazon takes btc, but you can use Gyft to buy giftcards good on sites like Amazon.

The notary/arbiter system.  Basically, you have a free market for dispute resolution.  Good and fair services that successfully address scamming should become popular and profitable.  Those services can have their own standards for procedure, and the market should find a balance between convenience, cost, and fraud prevention.  You could pay extra for a more thorough service for big ticket items, etc.
It might take a while to get it right, but right now the eBay system is so heavily stacked toward the buyer that it shouldn't be difficult to improve upon.

Buy and hold is probably the way to go.  Yes, it's very similar to investing in a security like stocks.
Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset and extremely risky.  Understand your various investment options before considering any significant buy into bitcoin.  Something like 10-20% of your savings (if you're young, under 30) is about as high as any reasonable person would go.  If you learn a lot about the technology and start to really believe in it, feel free to do whatever you'd like, but until then, stay small.
The way to think about it, in my mind, is to understand the ways it might fail or succeed.  For instance, a flaw in the protocol could be found, crashing the value to nothing overnight.  Alternatively, Bitcoin could take over the remittance market, which would likely place its value many times higher than what it is now.  As you learn more, you'll get an idea of what price to expect in the future, given certain assumptions.
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:58:12
The most simple/straightforward explanations for the past few months:
* China is creating a lot of selling pressure because it's likely that they'll ban bitcoins.  Chinese investors want to sell their coins, thus increasing supply and driving the price down.
* The MtGox fiasco shakes confidence in the coin and creates bad press.
* The persistent downward trend is making people shy away from buying in until there's some indication that the trend has stalled or reversed.
Where does it go from here?  No one knows.  This could be the end, some new information could send it skyrocketing, or it might not change much at all for a while.
Unless your timeline is fairly long (a couple years) I'd be hesitant to buy.

Hey, I think this is a fine idea, but I think it's difficult to justify 60 grams of tea for just over $45 after shipping.  There are lots of sites you can get high-quality teas for much less.  While I can find the occasional outlier that is similarly priced, all of your teas are priced this way.
How do you justify the cost?  Is this based on quality, or is this a fair trade premium?
I'm also confused by the wholesale section.  The page appears open to any customer and provides *far* more competitive prices.  Even with bulk discounts, I don't see why the difference should be as high as 50cents/gram vs. 8cents/gram.
It seems like a great deal is being spent on packaging and shipping.  Why aren't you offering e.g. 50 grams options?

You can still get unlucky, but such a system would have stronger incentives to play fair, so everyone benefits.

I think most of the regulations make sense for the actual financial services firms, and perhaps even what's proposed for the users of these services.  I think they're too onerous for the latter, but I think that point can be argued.
I think there needs to be another tier of classification for services that aren't traditional financial services, but are better described as technological services.  Wallet providers, facilitators like LocalBitcoins, etc.  These services can't operate under the proposed regulations, nor does it make any sense for them to be regulated like a financial service.  Any regulations that don't recognize these different classes misses the mark.

While I don't agree with those 'idiots' overall, I think they're right to have concerns (not about Maxwell specifically, but Blockstream in general).  It *is* possible to compromise Bitcoin in the long-run, and if it happens, it's going to look like a death by a thousand cuts.  There's going to be systematic pressure to centralize parts of Bitcoin because it's convenient, powerful, or in the interests of powerful parties.

I think bitcoin days destroyed is a better indicator of the health of the market.  For instance, if it's too low, you've got the potential for a lot of very old coins to suddenly enter the market at any time and really destabilize it.  The steadiness of BDD is a good sign, to me, that this destabilization isn't taking place:
This graph of, essentially, active addresses shows that the network continues to grow, but doesn't say much about the nature of that growth.  I interpret it's strongest conclusion to be that there hasn't been a dramatic change in the network.  It's hard to say much beyond that, but it's more informative than at first glance.

You can think of it either way, but it doesn't make a difference.
The original price included the costs of the transaction fees and risk, otherwise it was eating into profits.  So, from that perspective, the price already was raised.  The 'discount' just brings the price back to what it would be without the risk of chargebacks and cc fees.

Well, a good researching strategy is a good start.  Start by looking up how to do things, and then when you decide what you want to do, look up how to make mistakes.  Googling 'brainwallet insecure' 'brainwallet mistakes' etc. would turn up issues like this.  That's a great way to avoid known pitfalls.
If you want to be really secure, you have to do things like boot Tails from a CD, confirming that it's a clean copy, using an air-gapped machine, and storing your private keys in some secure way.  There is no perfect solution, but good practices make it quite unlikely that they'll fail.
You can also choose to trust e.g. Coinbase to control your bitcoins.  The tradeoffs there are trusting them and relying on the two-factor security.  It's a pretty reasonable solution (more reasonable than trusting Mt. Gox, but it's still an important precedent).
Oh, and try not to talk about how many coins you have, either in person or online.  You can make yourself a target.

Not really, s/he's just explaining the technology.  It's a distributed and secure way to store data.  It only relies on the existence of the network and the strength of the encryption.  There's no single physical thing that's at risk, and the very idea of ownership of the data is nebulous.
Sure, you can imagine uses for illegal things, but what about privacy?  What about the Snowden leaks?  He was lucky in that he had plenty of opportunity to get the information to trusted parties.  With a system like this, you just upload the data to the network and all you need to control is the key.  It's trivial to send it to whomever you'd like.

Escrow services can develop their own methods for fraud prevention and people can choose which ones they like the best.
One of the best methods of prevention is accountability, and you see this already to some degree on eBay: you try to buy from trusted sellers, people who have proven to act fair in prior transactions.  What's really missing with eBay is accountability for buyers.
You can also have buyers and sellers put up collateral to incentivize an agreeable outcome.  In the case of a stalemate where the escrow service deems no single party clearly at fault, they both risk losing the collateral.
None of this is trivial; you have to design a system that isn't easy to game, and you still have significant risk for people just entering the system without a track record.  Creative and proactive fraud management will be needed.

There's often a gap between nice intro tutorials and actually making things.  To take the next step, you need a goal, something to make.  Then you read up on what tools you might need, start to become familiar with them, and then actually try to put something together.
You can try things like  or guides like Invent With Python that go through some somewhat more advanced projects.  At the end of the day, just pick something and get to it.

Regardless of whether allegations are well founded, a private email conversation is not the way to address them.
This is Reddit.  Plead your case in the open, embrace peer review.
On a related note, I'm also wholly opposed to 'crowdfunded' science as a mendacious distraction from the issues of public research funding.  Lay people are not equipped to evaluate research proposals and can be mislead *even when there is no intent to deceive*.  A panel of scientist peers (as exists in every major granting institution) is the ideal.  The real issue is getting more public funding to these institutions.
I am your peer, and I am also your competitor.  I submit grants that compete against yours, and I want them judged by people who understand and execute empirical science.  **I do not want proposals to be judged based upon scare mongering and how frequently the term 'cancer' can be shoehorned into basic research**.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

The difference here is that they're already paid the mental cognitive cost by sitting down and using Mechanical Turk.  They're already engaged, so no context switching is needed.
They want to make your phone draw a little more power while plugged in, in exchange for not having to click a few buttons (in the best case) when you first get your phone.  I think that's going to be worth it for a lot of people.

You need to establish ownership of the old wallet somehow, and there are no funds associated with the old wallet.

There are **important ethical objections** against 'crowdsourced science' that I think should be mentioned here.
Scientific work requires the allocation of very limited resources to different proposals.  The evaluation of these proposals is one of the central missions of the scientific community.  It is accomplished by the evaluation of competing proposals **by scientist peers** who develop and execute research.  They are experts that are able to navigate extremely complex and nuanced methods and approaches in ever more specialized fields.
Crowdsourced funding of science undermines this merit based allocation of precious resources.  It replaces granting agencies with lay-people, thus devolving proposals to cheap advertising.  Lay people are not equipped to evaluate research proposals and can be mislead *even when there is no intent to deceive*.  **I do not want proposals to be judged based upon scare mongering and how frequently the term 'cancer' can be shoehorned into basic research.**
This whole endeavor takes what small amount of public attention exists from the real issue of properly funding granting agencies (e.g. NIH and NSF), instead redirecting it to your own selfish aims.  Perhaps you could argue that you're increasing public awareness in general, but you've lost the benefit of the doubt when you **deliberately manipulate/misrepresent basic research about a signalling pathway into a cancer treatment**.  Even the wiki page you link to about mTOR *doesn't even include cancer* in it's clinical significance section.  mTOR inhibitor treatments for cancer appear to be in the very early stages of research.  Furthermore, calling yourself 'cancer researchers' is wholly disingenuous when you are, in fact, a transcriptional regulation lab.  It appears most of you lab works on the circadian clock, for christ sake.
Your 'published work' does not appear to be peer reviewed (link to NCBI if I'm wrong), you aren't a cancer researcher by any reasonable standard, and you should get back to writing real proposals and publishing work.

Can you disclose the rate of flagged purchases, and perhaps some estimates on the false positives vs. genuine fraudulent transactions (that are blocked or missed)?
I think everyone understands the need for safeguards, but there's a potentially huge cost in missing out on purchases.  Coinbase may not be a trading platform, but it's often treated as such by opportunistic buy&amp;holders.
The ideal risk:cost ratio will likely allow a few fraudulent transactions if it can greatly reduce the rate of false positives.

Skepticism is good.  People 'investing' a significant amount of their savings is really just not a good idea.
The way I see it, I have plenty of saving that's either going into an IRA or I could take a grand or two and try out bitcoins.  It's volatile, but in a long-ish run the market and CPI can take some pretty big swings.  If I lose it all, no skin off my back; it was interesting to try out and I've already gotten some stuff out of it.

From the article:


@_date: 2014-12-12 08:00:47
True, but that's almost pure selling pressure.  I'm sure there are some miners that hold a significant portion of BTC, but it's not the majority.
The market for buyers and sellers is much smaller than the total supply of bitcoin.  There's probably a million or so coins that are simply lost or Satoshi's.  There's probably another few million held by long-term holder hyper believers.  Perhaps a couple million more are safely held at these prices, even if they aren't die-hards.
That 10% becomes a major fraction of the coins on the market.  I wouldn't be surprised if it were fully half of the selling demand.
Bears obviously do play a big role in this market, but I very much doubt that 10% accurately describes the mining pressure.
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:06:27
We're getting close to it.   Seems reasonable that it will be hit at least once before any changes are made to increase the block size.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:50:09
They needed to move those coins onto an exchange.  I suppose it's possible they've been there for a while, but the recent large blocks suggest they were moved there recently.
If those coins were old, then we would have seen a large spike in bitcoin days destroyed.  We have seen a spike of about 30,000,000, so that could mean 30,000 coins that are ~1000 days old.

Seems to me that diatribes like this are doing the most to divide the community.  There are legitimate ideological and technical considerations to argue for both sides.  Failing to see this is quickly descends into jingoism.  Worse, this is essentially ad hominem, implying that Gavin's 'PR campaign' is anything but doing his best to argue his position.  He's doing the right thing; explaining his position, as best he can, to the largest possible audience.  Unless you want to accuse him of making deceptive or simplistic arguments, the deficiency is clearly on the side of the alternative argument.
Put this another way: you disagree with Gavin about the urgency of the issue.  Rather than making an argument about how or why this isn't an urgent issue, you accuse him of fear mongering.  This is the lowest level of discourse.

This can be a legitimate assessment of risk vs. reward.  You can recognize the realistic possibility of losing it all while still thinking there's more upside than down.

If they're planning to do it anyway, that would make a lot of sense.  It's a big change to the site, though, so not exactly trivial.
If they start handling bitcoins, they'd really need a full security audit, which just doesn't seem practical for such a large site.  It'll be interesting to see what happens.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:28:39
I would have much prefered a hard fork of a cleaner segwit implementation.  More important, though, is that this represents an ideological shift whereby the reference implementation is no longer privileged, and the possibility of a fork is realized.
I think the core devs set a dangerous ideological standard in ignoring a quite clear user/miner consensus for bigger blocks.  We are not mewling masses with ignorant beliefs; with enough conviction comes action.

You wouldn't be able to.  Certainly extra security measures would be needed for that, either by limiting the 'one click' wallet size to something very small, or with additional security measures like 2FA.
I doubt the latter would happen as now we need real security for using Reddit, which is going to be an inconvenience for the vast majority of users that don't need it.  It makes the site much more attractive to hacking and is generally no aligned with the site's use.
Perhaps you could have a one-click that requires extra authentication, but I don't think that will happen initially.

Because mine is the *de facto* standard, whereas you're assuming something totally new?
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:07:10
You can send coin back and forth to yourself on the blockchain, so yes, it can be faked.  If you did this a lot, eventually transaction fees would start to make it infeasible, but we're not at that point.
The first question is why someone would do this.  Faking transaction volume on an exchange makes sense, but it's not so clear for blockchain transactions.
The second issue is that it should be relatively easy to detect obvious manipulation.  There could be major changes in ratios of transactions to days destroyed, activity among the largest vs. smallest wallets, etc.  Careful work would make it very difficult to detect, but that takes effort.

I don't see why you're assuming you'd be able to tip from your Reddit account.  If that were the case, then you'd be correct, certainly.
I think one of two things will happen:
* Reddit controls a wallet for you, but limits the amount in it.  Anything over that gets pushed to an address you control.
* Reddit simply provides an interface to make tipping from your own wallet easier.

No.  This is Back whining that he didn't get his way, looking for any way to spin it other than that.  There is no consensus, that is just beyond abundantly clear at this point.

All this does is relate an address to your account.
From Reddit, even while logged into your account, you won't be able to touch the bitcoins in the wallet.  All you can do is change the address where coins go when they're sent to your username.
That does constitute a security issue; people can claim to be you on reddit if they can access your account, and then have coins sent to their wallet instead.
However, there is no risk of draining wallets anymore than posting your bitcoin address on a website for donations.  You're fundamentally misunderstanding the risk.

I'd imagine there are significant savings from reducing compliance/regulatory overhead.  It also lowers the cost of entering the market (as a teller), which should provide some advantage.

@_date: 2017-03-02 23:22:05
GDAX fees aren't that high.  Coinbase is a brokerage, whereas we're talking about exchange fees.  A brokerage will charge higher fees, generally.
If you want to avoid Coinbase fees, be a market maker on GDAX.  That means you set up a buy order below the spot price (or sell order above).  If the price goes down a little, then your order gets filled and you've got your coin without any transaction fee.  If the price goes up, your order won't get filled.  You can either wait to see if it goes back down again, or just set up a new buy at a higher price.
Generally there's enough 'chop' in Bitcoin price that orders get filled pretty easily.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:36:29


I fail to see this dichotomy.
I personally want to see the limit raised or even removed so that we can have a balanced system where blocks are as large as the fee market will bear, and as small as miners are willing to mine.  I also see it as a practical necessity as we approach the limits of the network, regardless of whether BTC is used as a credit card replacement.
I see credit-card-type use cases as very late-stage for Bitcoin.

I understand the Bitcoin XT issue differently from you.  First, proposing it at this point still leaves a fair amount of time before a decision is made.  However, unless you feel that Gavin's sense of urgency is disingenuous, there is a need for relatively prompt action.  Second, the alternative would be to sit on this, in which case it seems likely that his critics would accuse him of withholding his intentions or planning in secret.
Instead of recognizing these issues, you're quick to accuse him of acting duplicitously.  Which is exactly why the debate needs to move away from ad hominem and discussing peoples' intentions.  
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:38:30

You don't need to attack him (not saying you are), just advocate for using a different forum.
We definitely should not let the censorship slide.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:34:15
On the chance you aren't baiting, I'll respond.
First, the Theymos thing certainly amplified a lot of ill-will toward core, but that certainly wasn't the cause.  The overwhelming DDOS of XT nodes didn't help, either, but again it's beside the point.
The real issue is simple; most of the network users want bigger blocks.  This is easy to quantify for miners based on the support of Classic from pools, but the popularity of XT despite DDOS and blacklists certainly argues for that for node operators.  Many of the Bitcoin businesses weighed in as well, expressing support for bigger blocks.  Voting on Reddit, even with the censorship, clearly favors bigger blocks.  Anyone can argue the point because it's hard to measure, but any reasonable interpretation of this is that the majority want bigger blocks at all levels of network usage.
Core said no.  Emphatically, even, and it's exactly at the point where people want to move.  Bitcoin users aren't ignorant sheep that need to be guided and coddled by benevolent (or otherwise) overlords.  The power of the network lies in it's users, otherwise it's just as centralized and broken as any other system.  This is simply exercising that power.
I think it's a mistake to say this is a rebuke to the core contributors' work.  It's just a refutation that we will not be dictated to.  If they have the unmitigated audacity to insist that they know better, then they have lost the privilege of having their software run the network.
To add insult to injury, Core added RBF.  This goes firmly against how many people actually use Bitcoin, and is ridiculous to many others.  All it does is enable a future of Bitcoin envisioned by the core developers that is very different from what we have today.
That future may come about; it may or may not be a better solution.  That's not the point, though.  If that future is to come (sidechains, LN, BTC as settlement layer, etc.), it will happen because users choose it.  It will not be forced on the network.
The actions of Core are tyrannical, full stop.  They are still valued contributors, but they have demonstrated that they should not enjoy the privilege of providing the reference implementation.  We are also not so lacking in developers that we are beholden to them.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:19:22

* If it gets filled, congratulations, you're done.  You can send the BTC back to your Coinbase account, and then to your own wallet.

@_date: 2017-03-06 20:49:52
For those on both sides of the debate, how do you feel about Bitcoin's fragility?  Honestly.
To me, the entire premise of Bitcoin is that it is a network that may be able to survive everything short of a majority of malicious actors.  That is the point of Nakamoto consensus.  Deep down, it's just a bunch of people agreeing that some numbers mean something, and here we have a cryptographic system, combined with a value token, that may make it possible to trust without trust.
If Bitcoin cannot survive contention, cannot survive disagreement, then it has already failed in its mission.  If you feel that a hard fork, which is ultimately the mechanism that resolves network disagreements and attacks, is fatal, then Bitcoin is dead.  That's not support for a hard fork, just an observation about what this experiment is about.  Without this ability, the network is completely vulnerable.
I also urge everyone to consider how a user-activated soft fork functions as an attack vector.  Mining is resistant due to the economic incentives behind it, combined with proof-of-work.  This is such a core element of Bitcoin.  Some ideas for UASF seem to essentially function as proof-of-stake, a *radically* different vision for how the network would operate.  Perhaps a valid one, but nevertheless a dramatic change.  There seem to be other proposals that are trivial to attack, such as node-operator signaling; it boggles my mind that any serious Bitcoin proponent would forego all network security so easily.
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:32:45

What this all comes down to is the central premise of bitcoin; it *is* the network, it *is* the users.  It's a piece of technology that enables trustless participation in a network.
It's complete futility to think that a few people could control the financial functions of the world, stewards of economies from on high.  There will always be politics, because that is the nature of society that doesn't always agree.  Making those decisions is a difficult process, but there is simply no avoiding them.  To think that Bitcoin can't be changed without consensus is nonsense.  The possibility of a fork is reality, and if Bitcoin can't withstand that, it's not up to the task laid out before it.
I thinks this will get 'worse' before it gets better.  There's going to be a change in the governance of Bitcoin, but what that will be is a mystery. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:14:47
Bitcoin is broken without the possibility of forking.  It's what keeps the power in the hands of the network participants, allowing them to use the Bitcoin they want.

The concept of possession, in this case, is quite simple.  Ownership, on the other hand, relies on contracts and enforcement of those contracts.  That's a lot less simple.

FWIW those aren't transaction fees, but rather brokerage fees.  Transaction fees are what's needed to convince miners to include your transaction into a block, whereas the Coinbase fees are for the brokerage service.  Brokerages typically charge a premium, so it's not really unexpected.
It is certainly advisable to use an exchange like GDAX to avoid brokerage fees.

The feature here isn't that a typical user would move between exchanges often: it's arbitrage.  The value of the arbitrage opportunity is exactly proportional to the risk or cost of moving funds between exchanges.  If this is reduced, then arbitrage will be trivial and exchange prices will match much more closely.
As a knock-on to this, it's possible that Liquid could be used as a remittance vehicle.

Your phone can die, but as long as you remember/record your 12-word passphrase, you can recover it.  You just download it again and use the phrase to recover.
Basically, that 12-word phrase is a password that, when processed by the software, will result in the private key that controls your Bitcoin.  It doesn't rely on Mycelium servers or anything like that, just a particular hashing function.
Consider what will happen to the coins in the event you die or are incapacitated; you might want to keep the passphrase somewhere secure that family would have access to.

Honestly, you should just learn more about Bitcoin and how wallets work.  It's really worthwhile if you have any decent amount of coin.
The private key is basically everything, and you need to keep that secure at all costs.  Leaving that unencrypted on a network-connected computer is a *very* bad idea.  Substantial risk remains even after you 'delete' it.  I'd look at creating a new wallet in a secure manner and transfer your coins to that (use a small amount first to make sure you got it right).

It started with the development of Bitcoin XT to use 8MB (or was it 20MB?) blocks.  Basically there was growing division regarding scaling Bitcoin, and there was a movement to use a different Bitcoin client that would accept larger blocks.
I think it's safe to say that the moderators of this subreddit opposed this.  They declared that XT was an altcoin, and thus discussion of it was prohibited.  Many disagreed with this moderation strategy, considering it censorship, and started as an alternative.
Here are some articles that, at least, verify the timeline and give a little context.  I'm not linking them as correct or incorrect, just as context.  
  
   
A lot has been said about this conflict, so feel free to read up on it.  I find that there's a lot of politicizing about a variety of Bitcoin issues, so finding the primary source is idea.

As with all things Bitcoin, think about attack vectors.  This would constitute a fundamental re-design of the network.
Mining is the process by which txn's are incorporated into the blockchain.  It's the entire foundation of the Bitcoin network that permits decentralized decision making, what makes the whole thing possible.
Think about the Byzantine General's problem and what kind of consensus you're talking about.

In terms of a new high, it's actually probably a bigger increase.
The biggest 'loss' of coins is likely Satoshi coins.  Similarly, more people likely lost coins back when they were worth very little, while not much is lost today.  Thus, the lost coins make up a smaller proportion of the total supply today than they did at the last bubble.
So while neither number is very meaningful in absolute terms, they are quite meaningful in relative terms; we are almost certainly at a much higher 'market cap' now.

Sure, it's not a given that it would become popular.
However, there are plenty of reasons why that wouldn't happen that don't involve some bizarre aversion to digital currency.  Mostly, people don't trust things they're unfamiliar with.  Often, people base their trust on things that carry authority, namely branding.  There isn't a two-second pitch why you should trust or care about Bitcoin.  No 'FDIC-insured' or 'backed by Morgan-Stanley' or some other BS.
Stuff like this won't take off until legitimacy comes around.  For now, Bitcoin is squarely limited to people that can devote significant time to understanding it.  That's why B2B or e.g. remittances are the best bets for now.
That would change with increased adoption, if that's what happens.

Have a time period in mind, at least.
My initial investment/gamble was made with the expectation that I'd hold for at least 5 years.  At the lowest, I was down about 50%.  I'm currently up ... quite a bit more than that ;)
But for me, this was a way to spend some extra savings on something I was interested in that *might* have huge payoffs in the future.  Like, house &amp; early retirement payoffs, so that definitely requires a lot of holding on the off chance that comes true.
So it's not just a price, it's how it works into your life.  Not much point in dying with a bunch of Bitcoins; using it somehow is assumed.  And you don't need to sell all, so when 50% of your stash reaches some goal, you could part with that and let the rest ride.
@_date: 2015-08-23 22:04:29
You see the following dichotomy: decentralization vs. bigger blocks.
I think any careful reading of the debate shows that is not necessarily the case.
* That dichotomy may be a mischaracterization: the increase in block size may be below a threshold where centralization is actually appreciably incentivized.
* Block size limits may not be the appropriate way to dis-incentivize large blocks.  The probability of orphaned blocks and miner self-interest may 'naturally' restrict block size.  An artificial cap could be superfluous and not ideal.
* Block size may be orthogonal to centralization.  In other words, there may be more important or effective ways to encourage decentralization without limiting block sizes.
All of these issues have been discussed in detail.  Much of this gets down to the very core incentives for Bitcoin network participants.  It's a very complicated issue, which is a large part of why so much discussion has taken place, and will continue to.
Side-note: it's interesting to me how little mining fees get brought up any more.  It seems that the old argument was about securing the network after block rewards and creating a fee market.  Now it's all about centralization.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:03:58
XT is basically just core with bigger blocks.  There are some other differences, but nothing I've seen that seems significant.
Protocol rules can always be restricted with a soft fork.  It's only new rules that require a hard fork.  Even undoing the bigger blocks would be much easier than putting them in.
I don't understand the view that this somehow empowers Gavin and Mike.  Other implementations will be made compatible if the fork occurs, so you could simply not upgrade changes you don't like or use other clients.  There's no reason to think any future changes wouldn't get just as much scrutiny as before.
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:37:30
IDK, a big part of the block size debate is that it's viewed as using precious 'extra capacity'.  Extra capacity in the sense that there are marginal performance requirement increases possible that won't further centralize the bitcoin network.  That capacity could be used to mine larger blocks, or it could be used to implement new functionality like privacy features.
This is strong desire to implement a lot of stuff, but privacy consistently seems to be among the highest priorities of many developers.  Certainly not all, and certainly not without contention, but it's clearly up there.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:01:28
If you bought off an exchange, there are records of that.  Get a hold of them.  As long as you can account for how you got them, it's not an issue.
If you mined, that might be tough.  Since you control the coins, you can confirm they originated in a coinbase transaction, but you might need to find some specialized legal/financial service to work through that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:54:15
Safe withdrawal is 4%, yes, but it's "safe" because it corresponds to the worst 30(?) year period for investing.
Typical returns are closer to 6%, and good returns are higher yet.  So 6% would be a bit of a gamble, but as long as you costs aren't fixed, you could lower that rate in the case that you get unlucky.
Basically, I'd be fairly comfortable taking everything but the principle, and just wouldn't travel as much if the market took a shit.

I've spent a lot of time reading what the core devs have had to say about this.  No where can I find the existential threat they fear.  There is a very clear trade-off at play.  You can pick from the following:
* Scale the network
* Add new functionality (for privacy, security, etc.)
* Minimize the incentive to centralize the network
The difference in opinion mostly lies between which of the first two options is of highest priority.  The last item is clearly a priority to all involved; this is why scaling is designed to keep pace with technological improvements to achieve a sort of 'incentive stasis'.
There are very good reasons to think that Bitcoin needs to be improved and expanded upon.  There are also good reasons to think that restricting scalability will have significant and long-lasting consequences.
This is not a decision about an enlightened vs. ignorant ideas.  This is a tradeoff about priorities, and it's unsurprising that they differ between informed parties.  I find it very troubling that many people, on either side, insist on ill-will or ignorance to explain alternative interpretations of uncertain data.

Genetic drift would be seemingly innocuous differences in implementation, unnoticed bugs, etc.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:35:31
You wouldn't need a fork, though.  Assuming Core adopts bigger blocks, or there's some other popular implementation, people would just use that.  Since the rules wouldn't be any different, no fork would occur.
Or, let's say that XT introduced some new stuff that people realized they didn't like after the fact, it just takes a soft fork to undo that.
The forking process correctly makes new rules difficult to implement, and restricting rules easier.
XT itself is mostly irrelevant here.  The only major difference is block size; that's what's really being voted on here.  It's trivial to change other implementations to be compatible.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:29:15


Oh please.  You mean they actually made coherent posts and engaged with the community?  They simply understood that users control Bitcoin, and that it's ultimately up to them how to prioritize Bitcoin development.
This fork is about tradeoffs.  The decision of whether or not to prioritize scalability, to the possible detriment of decentralization or feature headroom, is in the hands of the users.  To sit quietly while the decision was made by default is wrong.  Making 'noise' about the issue was entirely appropriate and necessary.

I should have said "typical returns should support 6%" or something.  Average over the past century is something like 10 or 11%.
The 4% figure accounts for inflation and assumes you continue to withdraw the same inflation-adjusted amount.  I.e. the withdrawals get bigger over time to offset inflation.
The main point is still that 4% is "safe" even in the worst 30-year period we've seen in the market.  There's no guarantee we won't see a worse period.  Of course, most of the time, you'd still have a substantial amount left over after 30 years.  If your costs can adjust, then it's okay to draw off more.  There's still risk, but the idea is that you won't e.g. lose your home in a bad market, you just forgo some luxuries.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:27:35
Could be.  Could also be that the price is just doing what it does.  It's very difficult to tie price movement to news; lots of major events don't cause any movement.

But yeah, fairly likely related to the news.

I say long-term because, going far out enough, we're looking at completely novel technologies to keep up with the pace of growth, and thus uncertainty.  Since it only takes a soft-fork to restrict the protocol, I don't see this as an argument against BIP101.
More importantly, though, is that the current exponential scaling really only covers one use-case for Bitcoin.  This transaction rate supports a given number of users for purposes of a reserve.  It's not widely used as a medium of exchange.  It's also not being used in any of the novel ways that programmable money could be used for.  It's in this sense that I support novel solutions for scaling the utility of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, I highlight the rapid growth because it makes BIP101 *more* important in my view; hitting the blocksize limit presents a very real threat and more precious time is needed.

I imagine a wallet would put transactions below some certain threshold on LN; that way the incentive to delay funds is decreased as well as a the inconvenience.  Thus, LN would help Bitcoin scale for smaller transactions.  
In other words, it scales out the use-cases for Bitcoin, but not necessarily the user-base.

The transaction rate has been doubling approximately every 1.5 years over the past 3 year period.  Before that it grew more quickly and variably.  The growth rate looks solidly exponential, which means we're looking at 4MB blocks in about 4 years, and 16MB in 7.
Long-term, there definitely needs to be another solution to scaling.

It is absolutely political because it is based on a particular economic model.  For instance, by using Bitcoin, you're making a choice to use a deflationary medium of exchange.  It is much more than a simple protocol: politics are baked in.
The blocksize debate gets at the heart of another political issue: how are we going to incentivize the Bitcoin network?  It's far from clear what is the best way to do it.  How does a post-reward network work with low fees and more transactions vs. higher fees and fewer transactions?  Does one method lead toward dangerous incentives?  For complex economic systems, it's no easy task to answer these questions with reasonable confidence.
Satoshi explicitly took this into account, and made sure that the protocol was, ultimately, in the hands of miners who have economic incentive to see that Bitcoin is highly valued.
@_date: 2015-08-10 02:31:51
The power was always with the miner, from the beginning.  This was a deliberate design choice by Satoshi because only they could reliably have economic incentive to see Bitcoin succeed.

I posit that any system that deals with power/influence among humans needs robust checks and balances.  This is well illustrated by the current debate which centers on balancing incentives for Bitcoin users to create a useful and secure system, and how block size limits play into that.
The ultimate check in Bitcoin is the possibility of a hard fork.  As much as we're protecting against adversarial miners, we must also protect against adversarial developers (intentional or otherwise).  *This is not imply that the core developers are currently somehow adversarial*.  I understand that some people feel that way, but it's irrelevant to the core issue: whether the ability to hard fork is an essential part of the system.
**There is no system that cannot be compromised**.  Everyone else in the world can decide that the 21 million limit is bogus and refuse to interact with anyone who upholds it.  Ultimately, unless totally self reliant, you are to a greater or lesser extent at the mercy of others.  This utopian illusion of a sacrosanct Bitcoin is a fallacy.  The best you can hope for is a system that disincentivizes undesired outcomes.  Concepts of power do not exist in a vacuum; the alternative to democracy is not utopia.  It's dictatorship, plutocracy, meritocracy, communism, volunteerism, etc. etc, not perfection.
The concept of majority rule, as a technical feature of block propagation, is democratic.  The concept of decentralization is, again, majority rule.
Why would the software be anything other than majority rule?

I think this distinction deserves a lot more attention in the public discourse.  It's at the root of so many political differences.
To paint with a broad brush, many conservatives are thinking at this individual level, where more meritocratic thinking has some utility.  You could have all the disadvantages in life, but your best bet is still going to be hard work and get ahead.  Discussing the disadvantages many face, while they are real and can be influenced by policy, is antithetical to this thinking.
Whereas many liberals recognize the huge differences that circumstance imparts on people, and how that could/should be addressed through public policy.  Taken to the extreme, you start to deny personal responsibility, or else seek to redress the problems of inequality through inefficient systems that can be taken advantage of.

Straight talk: it's not easy to understand.  Many of the arguments strongly rely on implementation details that affect how Bitcoin network participants are or aren't incentivized to behave 'properly'.
Most of it depends on extrapolating to behavior of a larger network, as well as making predictions about future technology.
There are several debates:
* Are block size limits appropriate?
* If so, what is the ideal block size, and how should it change over time?
* Who controls bitcoin?  Are hard-forks appropriate?  Is it majority rule, or is it based on 'consensus', for various definitions of consensus.  (This issue, especially, tends to move into political thinking, which is perfectly natural when you think about it)
* How are technical details disseminated to a broader audience.  Are we suffering from 'cults of personality', or are some parties communicated better / more clearly?  Are there shills, charlatans, etc. or is it all just about code?
Backing all these questions are more technical concerns about how hypothetical attackers to Bitcoin might behave.

Reddit's costs are hosting fees and salary for employees.  A decentralized Reddit means you pay to access the site, and those funds go to whoever wants to host the site.  Your traffic would come from the best host (as determined by some algorithm), and they would be paid by you, and everyone else who accesses content through them.  You could also have a fund that skims off of this to pay development bounties or some similar system.
I think it's a cool project that could work.  What I don't like is the notion that content and upvotes would be paid.  This sounds like biting off more than you can chew, as it introduces numerous issues and complications that don't have clear solutions.

Conservative in which sense?
If you're thinking about adoption, bigger blocks are conservative; they have lower fees and permit more on-chain transactions.  The risky case is to depend on e.g. LN to allow scalability.
In the simple sense of tradition, and perhaps/likely security, smaller blocks are indeed conservative.
In the end, more thorough and reasoned arguments are to the benefit of all.  This is clearly a fairly pivotal era for Bitcoin, and it seems only right that a great deal of thought is put into figuring out the future.

Intentionally deleting a wallet is an entirely different issue.  In that case, deliberately deleting a wallet serves a practical or ideological function.

That's certainly the case now because BTC exchanges aren't everywhere.
Most developed/western countries have access to some method that works fairly well.  You can use Circle or Coinbase quite easily and with minimal fees (1% or $1.37 in this case).
Basically, if you can convert BTC to local currency for ~10% fee, then you're competitive with Western Union or better.  That seems like a hell of a business opportunity, but it is predicated on wider knowledge of this option.  Ideally you'd have a service that covers both the sender and receiver end for customer convenience, which is going to add significant overhead.  Nevertheless, the opportunity is there.  Once bitcoin-based services become viable, it won't take long before people realize they can cut out the middleman.
At this point, I don't see how it doesn't take off, sooner or later.  The market is pretty good about correcting inefficiencies like this, especially when regulatory capture or anti-competitive practices are inhibited by international borders.  Barriers to entry are fairly low, just some mild capital requirements.  All it takes is one country to set the example.

I have a couple questions:
* Scale - As I understand it, you incentivise hosting p2p Reddit with small bitcoin transactions.  If this were to scale up to the size of Reddit today, how many transactions are we talking about?  Is this really practical without e.g. sidechains?
* Incentives - The hosting incentives make perfect sense to me; you can try to hit parity by hosting while consuming, or more efficient hosters will make accessing content very inexpensive.  However, you also talk about incentivizing upvotes and posting content.  To me, this is a *much much* more complicated problem.  Not only are you vastly increasing the incentives to spam/game the system (thus requiring more protections, if it's even possible), you also change the nature of the community.  It seems very difficult to properly design incentives without harmful side effects.  My question is whether you see these as separate issues, and I'd like to hear your thoughts about keeping the community functioning with bitcoin karma.

Might seem that way, **but it won't happen**.  At least not anytime soon.  UDP isn't supported by TOR, so you'd have to use e.g. I2P.
It's something that *could* be done, but it seems unlikely.  The devs seem to think that the dark-market connotations are too risky for a truly anonymous market.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:18:15
I agree that it won't be 'big'.
It doesn't have to be, though.  If, for the first few years, all you get are some small communities that use OB, then you've won.  It will have to start with groups that are willing to overcome the high cost of entry (acquiring BTC, setting up OB, etc.).  Groups that are very dissatisfied with current marketplaces for one reason or another.
Lots of people think that means illegal stuff, and rightly point out that OB isn't suited for that.  However, there are grey markets that could be well served, as well as classes or products that are tricky for dispute resolution or simply low-margin.  Imagine a trusted forum operator for some hobby setting up as an escrow/dispute service for OB.  Now everyone buying and selling East German Lunchboxes knows to use them, and a small marketplace blossoms.  In that scenario, the service could improve a lot with a dedicated user base, and mature significantly.  Then, all you need is some more BTC adoption (think 5 year timescale) and you've got a compelling situation.
It's important to remember that this is FOSS, so developers can get burned out.  All you need is some small spots of heavy engagement and you'll keep getting some more people to contribute.
In the end, don't underestimate the rabid eBay fanatic.  If they show up, it's all set.

Well that would be the idea, rather than deal with credit cards or paypal.
Because very few people have BTC, it's going to be a hard sell.
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:59:59
There would need to be a price incentive.
Right now, eBay is geared 100% for the buyers at the expense of sellers.  This makes OB an easy sell for sellers; much lower fees, no PayPal that will suspend your account or take your money, and hopefully an effective decentralized dispute resolution service.
For buyers, there isn't much.  One thing is that you could have better selection; so many sellers are turned off to eBay after a few bad experiences.  It's really hard for casual sellers of actual used goods to be successful.  So, if they turn up on OB, that could be big.  The other thing would be if the seller passed on some savings and listed lower prices.
In the end, OB has two major hurdles to overcome:
* It has to actually attract users.  This is really hard without e.g. VC funding to push marketing.  It'll have to grow organically, which means it will need to offer compelling service right from the beginning.
* It has to be a better market.  The 3rd party escrow/dispute system needs to really work, and to be economical.  There are real costs to running online marketplaces, and it remains to be seen whether we can get a competitive market for moderation/escrow services.
I really hope it works, but I also wouldn't be surprised if it's ahead of its time.  If just a couple lively communities can get foothold (e.g. OB is *the* place to buy and sell collectable frisbees or what have you) I think it will slowly grow.  If not, the hassle of getting BTC *and* learning how to use OB is just way too much for the average person today.  In five years, if BTC is more common, it would be a much easier proposition.

Just consider for a moment how common this scenario is.  Divorces are bitter affairs, and hiding assets is the oldest trick in the book.  "Oops, I lost it," is not a legal argument.  The court will assume you're lying unless you can provide good evidence otherwise (police reports or other records).
Your ex (and their lawyer) has access to all kinds of financial information from your marriage.  If there's a record of you sending money to a Bitcoin exchange, and you didn't get it back, then the court is going to assume you have bitcoins and it's up to you to explain otherwise.
Finally, no one gets tricked into getting married.  Part of the deal is sharing assets.  There are legitimate issues with divorce in the US (e.g. child custody) but hiding assets is straight theft from a voluntary agreement.

Even if the power company decides to hold, that's demand that's no longer on the exchanges, so a similar effect.

I think it's fair to say that there are two categories of changes you could make to Bitcoin: those that fundamentally change what Bitcoin was/is thought to be, and those that don't.  I don't think anyone argues that changing the fixed supply of Bitcoin would not violate the original Bitcoin principles.
Therefore, some discussion of the early design of Bitcoin is necessary, at least to feel out those limits and understand what was clearly part of the 'Bitcoin contract' at its inception.  As such, Satoshi's comments are clearly relevant when discussing this.
Now, obviously you can disagree that these core principles need to be preserved.  If the majority of people feel that they don't need to be, then there's little stopping an alternative from arising.  But, perhaps you subscribe to the idea that *you'd* like a set of core principles that aren't changed, so that being on the other side of the argument won't completely change important assumptions you made about the currency or technology.
So a lot of this comes down to whether there's some substantive reason to think e.g. the blocksize limit was intended to be a certain way, or whether it's a lot of post-hoc rationalization to support your current views.  Like it or not, Satoshi matters.

Escrow: A third party holds funds/assets/property/etc. on behalf of two parties making a transactions.  Funds are held until the rest of the transaction is complete, or similar conditions.  Escrow agents are usually given the authority to determine whether a contract has been met, etc.
Multi-sig: A Bitcoin feature that requires the majority of signatories sign off on a transaction before it can occur.
Usually there are three keys, one held by each transacting member, and one held by the escrow agent.  In the case of a dispute, the escrow agent will choose who to side with and use their signature to complete the respective transaction.

The proposal simply separates the proof-of-work from the actual recording of transactions.
Currently, you mine a block, include transactions, and then broadcast the whole deal.  This works quite well because this block is only accepted if all transactions are valid, i.e. no doublespends, etc.  This ensures that miners only include valid transactions, otherwise they would lose out on the mining reward (the coinbase and the txn fees).
What this aims to do is have the proof-of-work happen much the same way, but to separate out the txn stuff so that the proof-of-work can be quickly broadcast and verified.  This is an important issue, as large blocks take more time to broadcast, which incentivizes mining centralization (how much is debatable and all that, but that is the tendency).
How do you do that?  You can give the miner control of validating txns for the next ~10 minutes until the next block.  This presents a problem though: there's nothing to stop the miner from including double-spends and other invalid transactions, at least until the next 'key' block (perhaps? not clear).  The authors propose a 'check' on this by being able to retroactively cancel miner rewards (~~I'm unclear how this works, it's a very important detail~~ miners have to wait 100 blocks to transact already, something I did not know.  5% of the reward goes to the 'poisoner', and the rest are permanently lost (deflation?)), thus incentivizing miners to correctly verify that micro/transaction-blocks are valid transactions.  Presumably any invalid transactions will be eliminated somehow as well.  I get the impression that this would occur at the next 'key' block, but the article doesn't mention how this would occur.
From their blog post:


I'm going to read the whitepaper, and I'll summarize if I feel I understand it.
I think the simplest explanation is that the next 'block czar' generating the key block would fork the microblocks excluding any invalid transactions, so the double-spend would get pruned.
I'm still digesting all of this, but it does make a lot of sense.  It's such a radical departure from Bitcoin, though, that it would be incredible to see it integrated.  It still has caps on transaction rate, too, so it's not a permanent solution from a scaling standpoint.  It could be programed so that the limit increases at some rate, but you'd really want that pegged to technology, so it's hard to predict.

There are two order types: market and limit.  Market order means you're buying coins that someone else offered for a given price.  Limit order means that you're offering to buy to someone that wants to sell at a given price.  Market means you're buying slightly above spot price, and limit means you're buying slightly below spot price.
Exchanges will sometimes wave fees for market orders because it adds liquidity to their order books.  That's why GDAX does this.
If you want to avoid all this, just go on Coinbase's site and check out their options for recurring buys.
I think it's fine to be buying now, as long as you don't expect to see any return for a long time.  It could all come crashing down at any moment, but long-term, 5 to 10 years from now, I think it's still a reasonable investment.  Make sure you understand what you're getting into.

Blockchains are very very inefficient compared to e.g. traditional distributed databases.  Their key advantage is in their trust-less and robust nature.  Permissioned mining means you're fully rejecting the trust-less aspect of the blockchain.

Double your money is still double whether you buy $100 or $100,000.  And half is half, too.
To avoid fees, use GDAX (the Coinbase exchange) and be a market maker (limit order) so you don't pay any fees.  This means the price has to drop a little to get the order filled, so you might have to try a few times, especially in this market.
You could also just set up a recurring buy with Coinbase.  They'll tell you what the fees will be.

FWIW I stuck it out and got the doctorate, but I know some that mastered out and it's usually the best decision they could have made.  I'm split whether it would have been best for me, but the past is past.

Can someone link the part that implicates Jihan?

He certainly didn't lose them.  Perhaps he got rid of all/most of them for ideological reasons, but not by accident.

Are you implying Megaupload wasn't extremely profitable?  It was making nearly 200 million net profit before getting shut down.
Sure, that isn't 15 million paying customers, but they've got a solid business model.

The average person doesn't know what FOREX or an ETF is, but investors do.  I think we're talking about investor mainstream in this thread, more than anything.

What are you basing that accusation on?  Is it just that the posts tend to be upvoted quickly, or is there some other evidence?

It's certainly still a risky investment.
I agree, though, as a technology it's proven itself in many ways.  There are still experimental things it could yet be, though.

Yes.  It means that they abandon their original startup idea and pursue a substantively different one.  Basically, they've come to a point where they realize their idea likely won't work, and/or they identify a better alternative.

If they want mass adoption, they're going for an all-in-one solution.
That means hardware wallet (like Trezor), software to make it easy to use, and perhaps put a node and some mining in there as well.  The latter make less sense to me, but it seems fairly clear from their jobs postings.
I wonder if they're basing a new easy-to-use model on a new cryptographic technology to secure the spending process.

Transactions are rising, as expected from the price.  If it actually becomes an issue before there's a solution, it could get ugly.

Certainly there are lots of possibilities.  I was simply pointing out that deliberately destroying those coins is one of them.

I'd say it's more fixation that could lead to behavior like this.  But I agree, this seems more like run-of-the-mill mild nuts-o.

He says he bought whatever was on Coinbase, which at that point was at least ETH as well as BTC, so $30 sounds about right depending on the split.

Technically we'll never hit 21 million.  20,999,999.9769 is the limit with the current client.
Just a fun fact.

An (expensive) moderation strategy would be to ship to the moderator to validate the goods.  The moderator would carefully document the item, and likely have specialized knowledge about it to verify quality.  If shipping is reasonable and the chance of fraud is high (e.g. cell phones), then I could see this being a worthwhile strategy.

Well, evidently it was ready in 2011 when it was used.  Bitcoin was a major part in keeping their operation afloat.
Today, it can easily handle that.  It's difficult to remember how small Bitcoin was back in 2010.  It was trading well under a dollar and had basically no infrastructure.  It was still predominantly a hobbyist's curiosity.

People have all sorts of different break-even levels, though.  I don't think there's one particular point, but yeah it will add some sell pressure if this keeps going up.

Funny enough, this was a concern of mine at first.  I figured, if this actually becomes the 'world currency', then 8 decimal places isn't nearly enough.  Especially when you considered that microtransactions might be one of the cool things you can do with crypto.
Then I learned that it could be further subdivided (soft fork?) and stopped worrying about it.

The most simple attack goes like this:
* Search for username on other social media, forums, etc.
* Deep dive into comment history for identifying information, other potential usernames, geographic information, etc.
* Start searching the web, looking for any other threads to follow.
* If you get lucky, some of those other sites are compromised, and you can try to get passwords.  Some password reuse is often enough for things to get messy quickly.
* With enough info, you can start a targeted attack; customized phishing, continuous monitoring, and potentially meatspace attacks.
All of this is a lot of effort, so generally isn't worth it yet.  But the main issue is that it might become worth it in the future, and the record of you claiming ownership of  coins is effectively immutable.
It makes *a lot* of sense for someone to scrape forums like this and generate a dataset that may be very valuable in the future.  I would be very surprised if there weren't some people doing that.  Such information could be worth millions to someone that develops an effective targeted attack.
Basically, talking about this stuff online exposes you to some risk.  It may not be much now, but that could change, and why risk it?

If people actually used Bitcoin for retail, that would make sense.  That's not really the case, though.

What if years from now 10 BTC is worth millions?
How motivated are the attackers now?
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:13:26
Spear phishing is employed by states to gather intelligence and compromise foreign governments.  You think you have better opsec than spooks?  You think someone won't use similar tactics for a multi-million payout?
How naive do you have to be to think that 'magically discovering your private keys' is the only way to do this?  If the attack works, you *give them* access to your coins, one way or another. 
The point isn't that you *will* be hacked, it's that you'll be a target.  And the attackers are clever and patient.
You're on a list.  I am, too.  Anyone participating here is.  Because years from now if Bitcoin is worth 100x of what it is now, it's going to be an incredibly valuable data set.  Anyone talking about how much the own is now on a smaller, more valuable list.  Lists that will be bought by anyone that manages to develop an attack that's successful to any degree.

Yes, clearly it puts all the trust on the moderator, but it seems like that would be more manageable than vetting various sellers.
Getting really far out there, I wonder if you would have shipping services that could record packaging and hand-off.  E.g. you go to a UPS store with an item, and they have cameras set up to record it being packaged and handed off.  It wouldn't address broken items or otherwise not-visible issues, but it could stop the boxes of rocks.

There aren't assassins on the deep web.  The thing with Ross was basically an FBI setup.
I mean, it could happen, but I don't think there's any evidence that it's happened.

You know everything in each frame is carefully put there, whether it's a JuicePress^TM Juice or his genuine BoostedBoard^TM Electronic Skateboard.  This was a tease.
I wonder if it was the Ulbrecht book that got him interested, or the recent price action.  Maybe he bought some?
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:45:06
In 2013, the story was the price.  It's the same now, but the second time something happens is never as interesting.  Plus, just explaining what Bitcoin is was a big part of the story then, whereas now many people at least understand that there are things called digital currencies out there.  It's less strange, and therefore somewhat less notable.
