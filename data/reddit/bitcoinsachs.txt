This is one of the dumbest threads on Reddit.  I am betting "WeNeedMark" is actually Karpeles himself.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:26:49
My response is my own post from a few weeks back.
The guy is a pathological liar.  I just block him.  He has countless alts.  If he start making fun of him, you'll have 3 or 4 people message you saying "you have to talk to him on Skype like I do, he is really a cool guy."  lol.  Every single time.
He is an idiot.

Figured Fontas would have created distance from this parasite, but he never once clarified they aren't the same person.  Fontas should be creating as much distance as he can from that lunatic.  
Oh, and hi Peter.  Nice of you to enter the thread so casually.

meh, was posting it per her request.  Oh well.

perfect example why no one will ever take Dogecoin seriously.  Serious matter of a real life tragedy (this article may be fake, but this happens a lot when these things happen), and you fuckwads are talking in meme.  People have to understand it's just money.

Nothing I love more than a community that cannot even stand up and accept responsibility for it's own actions. Keep it classy reddit. Bunch of fucking trolls.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:38:58
bigger issue at hand.  First, why is it okay to post the guys house, car, and plates? Second, didn't this basically just give the world the ability to stalk someone who has gone out of their way to be private?  Our thanks to him is to do exactly what he doesn't want?  Third, if this is not him we are randomly going to ruin some guys life and drive him crazier.
I am not okay with any of this.

that made me lulz

That is nothing compared to last year.  Patience, infrastructure is being built.  You see the automobile is for sale, you want to buy one but you are discovering there aren't roads yet.  Patience.

Says the guy with the name RandomMuthafucka.  Apparently you don't see the big picture.  $5 isn't what we're talking about.  We are talking about people buying at $200-$230 when the all-time high is $267 and this is from an exchange you cannot cash out of.  So in order to talk profits that justify the risk, you'd need the price to reach at least $300 OR have tens of thousands you're investing, and if you're investing tens of thousands at $200+ you've already missed the boat.  China's push won't keep the bubble from bursting.  Have you kids learned nothing in the last few years or are you all newbies?

28, university CS dropped out after class project went live and started making real money. I am in to BTC, LTC, and ZET.  My 60 year old father who has no CS background at all is in to alt-coins pretty hardcore.  He sees the writing on the wall.

It's less than 4 months old.  That's all I am saying.

It's simple. Buy under $100 and sell where you're happy. Then have patience and rebuy under $100 because we all know it will crash and get back below.  If you are buying right now, you're a fool.

Don't get too comfortable gents. Mt. Gox will collapse and it's not fair off as their insolvency is going to end in a delicious capsize that will crush the market literally to the ground.  Should be a great time to buy before people come back to their senses. Cheers.

can we put some of this toward charity   people sort of need some help, you know, that stupid ole typhoon and what not. at risk of sounding like a 12 year old twilight fan, dare I say, team voorhees?

Guys, I think it might be time to consider an alternate storyline.  All major events kick off with a small bang before the real boom takes place.  We are all jacked up because a few good sized corporations are using it, and a very tiny piece of the Chinese population are getting involved.  It's barely scratching the surface.
India is a relatively tech savvy country with inexperience power, resources and developers.  Once they have access to a reliable larger scale exchange and people there start to take hold of it, they will be the ones to really drive the price.
The Chinese are conservative by nature, and made their name in textiles, not technology.  They are entering a whole new world, and it's a tiny fraction.  Just wait until this goes mainstream there and in India at about the same time.  The Tsunami will be breathtaking.
We saw a few large transactions lately.  Wait until the Billionaires and Hedge Funds start putting real money in play, I don't mean $150M which is child's play.  Anticipate a day where you see the price jump $3k in an afternoon.
Once Starbucks and Subway begin to accept it, McDonalds will - and they'll all fall in line after that.
Once Amazon takes the logical next step, anticipate Walmart and Target falling in line.
$1k is a drop in the bucket for a finite coin.  I am not living in fantasyland here.  Do the math.  How much does the so-called Market Cap have to move up to see a $10k coin?  Is it that unrealistic?  JPMorgan just paid a fine worth more than all of bitcoin combined.
Just saying.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:01:39
editorial section bro, not under news or a coin type
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:32:27
It strikes me this article is not taking a lot into consideration of this massive growth spurt.  Are there a lot of overzealous, over the top, To-The-Moon'ers? Yes.  They are in the minority though, and not what's driving this growth - and that's the important piece of the puzzle.
The Chinese are not pump and dumpers.  They are conservative by nature, and not built on capitalistic principles.  I don't anticipate a great sell off there.
Many nations are just being introduced to it, including modern America.
Bitcoin is on the news exponentially more than it was during the April Bubble.  Starbucks, Subway, and Virgin weren't considering Bitcoin muchless making press releases or tweets.
Billionaires weren't talking about it. Hedge Funds weren't recommending buying. Wall St Journal wouldn't even acknowledge it, much less recommend people buy it.
It's a much larger force driving this bubble than To-The-Moon'ers.  It's FINALLY getting real attention, and it's not driven by the overzealous.  What is it driven by?  The spike in attention among the tech savvy during the April Bubble yielded a lot of VC to companies like CoinKite, Coinbase, etc.  These products are trickling to the market which is finally meeting demand.
Back in April, Mt. Gox was the elephant in the room.  That's no longer true.  Those who wanted to get in on the action at Gox had to wait weeks and weeks.  I recall at one point the waiting list just to be processed in was 22k people deep.
We are not seeing a bubble at all.  I tend to agree with the Winklevii in stating it's still current UNDERvalue.  Sure, jumping $400 in an afternoon are microbubbles, but if you click on your handy charts, put it at a YTD and what do you see?  Go back All-Time, what do you see?  The arrow goes dramatically up.  Weak hands always shake out - but those aren't the people driving this, and it's important to make that distinction.
This whole thing has become a lot larger than, almost like a perfect storm of things happening at the same time, which ultimately is good.  I would not be surprised to see $1k by Christmas.  I would not be surprised to see it jump $1k in a single day.  Then again, I wouldn't be surprised to see it drop $500 in a single day either. 
Advice for new people:  Don't sell at a loss, ever.  If you buy and it drops, all that means is your stuck with those cards until you are sell at a profit again so sit there, shut up, and hold your cards and remember every time you get nervous to look at the all-time chart and remind yourself not to be a pussy little girl.

I am sure all the Quarktards will be downvoting the hell out of it.

he says a couple years ago. So you watched it like a hawk when you and like 13 other nerds were trading at 0.003, but now that it is over $300 you're not interested?  Good story bro. Got any snake oil while you're at it there, friend?

that's what I thought.  I also didn't think that was tremendous news.  In unrelated news, the Senate meets to talk about Bitcoin...Monday or Tuesday?

Some of us are just really good at predicting what was going to happen.  I hope all you tards sold at $600.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your coins at half price.  Nice job N00bs, buy high sell low. lol

It's a matter of time before Mt. Gox goes out of business anyway.  They are insolvent and their collapse is somewhat imminent despite their trade volume. Just saying. Carry on.
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:11:45
Even if it did play out the way they are making it appear, alt-coins will spike.  As they close the door on each alt-coin, another will come along, and ride until that door is closed.  Didn't they learn anything with LimeWire, Morpheus, et al?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:16:31
Yes, that's exactly correct. If you're keeping score, I called it perfectly - again.  You n00bs really need to grab the turned out pocket of an elder before you get bent over again.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:02:00
I will really enjoy reading all you idiots crying in your beer when Mt. Gox folds and the price crashes down to $30 and you've all gone bust.  Myopic and stubborn.  Cheers to you.  I'll take $50 and buy Kleenexes for you kids. You're gonna do some crying soon.
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:57:15
A failure to plan for exponential growth when that's been it's only trajectory is truly a plan for failure, no?  Don't get me wrong. Gavin and the whole lot of developers are absolutely amazing and Gavin probably should be Time's man of the year to go along with Bitcoin being Time's word of the year - but this should have been seen as a priority a year ago realizing by the time it needed to be fixed they'd have a working solution.  Live and learn.

Two things.
1. Disappointed he didn't capture the exchange him and I had in there. Probably cause he looks like an asshole.
2. He reads this section seeking his name and what people are saying about him.  No need to find him, he'll find us making fun of him.

Was wondering how long it'd take the quarktards to show up.  
**Correction** people ask me about zetacoins and I tell them. I also talk daily about Bitcoin, Bitbar, Yacoin, Litecoin, Feathercoin, Tagcoin.  It is almost like I talk about bitcoins and altcoins.  Oh wait, that's exactly what I do all day.
