It does when you consider that Core is proposing it as a stopgap solution to blocksize scaling.  If SegWit goes through without a scaling solution first, you bet your ass Core is gonna sit on their thumbs and then try to push lightning network through with no real scaling solution, forcing the network to rely on lightning.  They've gone on the record saying that they don't care how big fees get.  That's absolutely crazy and undermines the entire userbase that Bitcoin has built so far.  Fix block size first.

@_date: 2017-05-29 10:23:24
Everyone makes this argument but it's wrong.  It's a false choice since SegWit cannot be rolled back and it will be in and will affect the protocol even if it is ignored.  That's like saying you can ignore Donald Trump as president and it's the same thing as not having him as president.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:31:07
That's doublespeak.  Technically a softfork is more coercive than a hardfork.  It railroads the protocol and forces people to support it even if they don't agree with it, whereas a hard fork would be a clean break and the market would actually get to decide.  And if the SF has low support it's even worse than a failed HF.  The shilling in here for SW with lines like "It's all of bitcoin against a single guy" is just posturing.  There are plenty of people against SW and against UASF.  If it was only Jihan then we'd already have SW.  The fact is that SW and UASF are still contentious, and the majority actually supports a hard fork to larger block size.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:58:29


So is a block size increase.  In fact it's been ready for years, much earlier than Segwit ever was.


Being ready now is not a sufficient reason to implement it, obviously.  Especially with something like Segwit which cannot be undone.


No, it cannot.  Segwit cannot be undone unless all the UXTOs that use Segwit are spent in ANOTHER transaction that DOESN'T use Segwit BEFORE the rollback.  Which means that you have to get every. single. person. and device that has used Segwit to move their coins to another address in a non-Segwit transaction, otherwise their coins are open to theft by anybody.  Technically it is possible, just like it's technically possible for someone to randomly generate an in-use private key, or for the sun to not rise tomorrow, or for a gamma ray burst to completely destroy our planet in the next 24 hours, but it just isn't going to happen.  If Segwit is rolled back, people will lose their money.  Period.  So I guess it's possible if for some reason everybody is okay with that, but something tells me they will not be.


Oh please, both sides say the same thing.  That's the funny thing about war.  Who is right is decided after it is over.  The winners write the narrative.

Um, are you blind? There are plenty of users against SegWit and UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:42:52


In a few months there will be a few more rigorously tested options than just SegWit.  A block size increase will give more time for more methods to be explored.  Since SegWit cannot be undone, investigating other scaling solutions is a damn good idea and 2~4mb will allow us to do that.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:20:02
That makes no sense.  Miners, including Jihan, would make more money if blocks were bigger.  Bigger blocks = more transactions = more money.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:34:27
Care to point it out for me?  Because I clearly recall Core members saying in video interviews that they want high fees and small block sizes, and lukejr runs around supporting small blocks all day.  Miners can't hard fork without majority support, and Core is making sure that they don't get it.  Why the hell else would miners push for a 2mb hard fork in all their agreements?  Why would miners be angry with Core for breaking their 2mb promise in the last one?
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:20:37
The funny thing about this chart is that if you zoom in on the first half it looks exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:39:30


Cool numbers for something that has no evidence of use and is an efficiency boost, not a hash power gain.  If he actually had a $100m advantage he would have taken over Bitcoin by now.
Furthermore BU also plugs the ASICboost loophole, Jihan supports BU.  On top of that, transaction fees from constrained blocksize are flowing into alts, which is revenue he doesn't collect, and as Bitcoin loses market share his mining investments become worthless.  Delaying for ASICboost makes absolutely no sense from any perspective at this point.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:06:24
This makes absolutely no sense.  Larger blocks means more transactions which means more money for miners.  Right now the limitation in the block size means miners only get fees from a finite amount of transactions.  The rest of the transactions either wait or move to altcoins, where miners don't get fees.  Imagine if a store sold a product and intentionally limited their inventory in order to charge higher prices.  That might work, but not if there's a store across the street selling the same product for normal prices with unlimited supply!  Economically, miners have no incentive to keep blocks small, they would make more money by increasing the size.  It's basic economics, the supply and demand equilibrium is the block size where blocks are just barely full.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:04:43
No he can't because soft forks socially coerce miners into using the additions.
Unless you mean "invalidate" instead of "ignore", which he and other miners will be able to do if they soft fork on top of the SegWit SF.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:12:02
Miners make more money out of larger on-chain blocks than artificially high fees.

@_date: 2017-05-29 10:03:28
What's "enough" revenue?  The definition of "enough" revenue is completely subjective and irrelevant.  Like all businesses, it's about maximizing profit through economics, and the economics of miners are aligned with lower fees and larger blocks.  If block size (supply) is artificially limited, mining businesses cannot scale and are thus operating sub-optimally.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:53:39
Not at all.


His goal is not higher fees.  If the fees are high because of constrained block size then miners are making *less* money than they could be if the block size was increased to accommodate current transactions.  Implying that Jihan wants high fees *through block size constraint* is a misrepresentation of miner incentives.  It is *Core* that has publicly advocated for high fees and smaller blocks and if you want lower on-chain fees you shouldn't want that.  Bigger blocks = lower fees = greater miner profits.  SegWit = high L1 transactions = lower miner profits.




@_date: 2017-05-29 10:19:58


Because by definition UASF is basically a propaganda war.  In order to get UASF, you have to convince people to UASF.  In order to prevent UASF, we have to convince people not to UASF.  The harder you push for UASF, the harder we are forced to respond.


Not true.  Miners (Bitmain included) would prefer a hard fork to larger blocks immediately, but Core won't budge on that so they have been trying to compromise with SW + 2MB.  In reality, Core doesn't want bigger blocks *at all*, SW dealmakers won't allow the 2MB HF before SW, so that's the best deal Bitmain got.  Personally I think the NY deal is stupid, especially since it's the same as the HK deal that Core backed out of but that's where we seem to be at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:17:41
You're ignoring basic economics.  Max profit is at the point where supply and demand intersect.  Which means if blocks are expanded to just under the size of all transactions, the total fees per block would increase, which means higher profits.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:29:16

@_date: 2017-05-29 07:09:01

It's not about money.  It's about sending a message!
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:10:29
I know you probably know this but for clarity:
Miners don't *charge* fees at all.  This narrative needs to stop.  Fees are determined by supply and demand.  Supply is determined by the block size.  Demand has increased (more transactions), supply (the blocksize) has remained the same, resulting in skyrocketing fees.  Miners would make *more* money if fees were *decreased* by *increasing* the block size because this would allow the market to return to equilibrium with more transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:26:07
You got 3 things wrong: 
1. LN does not need SW.  This is straight from the mouth of LN's inventor Joseph Poon, who actually leans anti-sw (though he is not against a malleability fix).
2. Constrained blocks make *less* money for miners than blocks that allow for market equilibrium.  Bigger blocks mean more transactions at lower fees, which works out to *more* money for miners, not less.
3. It is in miners' economic interest to keep bitcoin sufficiently decentralized.  If Bitcoin becomes sufficiently centralized, people will move away from it and their profits will suffer because the value of fees will go down.  If anything in your slippery slope argument happens, miners instantly lose their hardware investments, including lots of research and patents on ASICs.  It is not in their interest to do this.
