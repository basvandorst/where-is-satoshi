"The second explanation would be that they are hedging exposure to any long bitcoin positions they currently hold. Such a tactic is common in volatile commodity markets but would typically be employed by commercial hedgers."

It's deflationary so it's purchasing power will continue to grow over the long term albeit at a gradually slower rate. There is no end price.

I stumbled upon bitcoin mid December. I'm glad I was dumb enough to think it was like stocks and thought I needed a minimum of one coin to get in which was almost 20k (which I didnt have at the time lol)
Have been saving up cash on the sidelines while watching the market go down waiting for the right time to get in.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:58:44

Pretty sure you just lose the 76k. The price you lose all your money would be just above your entry though lol
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:30:24
Yep, everything is setup. I'm waiting for capitulation below 5800 which seems to be this bear markets line of support or if prices move above the 200 day moving average then I think we are on the way back up. Both of these things haven't happened yet this year.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:50:59
Nah the exchange liquidates your position automatically when you've maxed out your position so you wont owe them more money than you have. The higher the leverage the more money you can control with your actual funds but also the closer the liquidation price is to your entry price.
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:52:01

The retail casuals are still getting over being burnt in 2018. Only institutions/smart investors and btc believers are buying atm.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:58:02
I see savings as something short term that needs to be liquid and stable for a purpose like an emergency fund or a goal like a car/holiday/house deposit.
I see an investment as something longer term like 5+ years that is used to grow my money and is more volatile but has a higher return like stocks/bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:22:03
My friend at work seemed interested in btc yesterday.. Sent him links for good videos to understand it, where to buy it, hardware wallet etc.

Everyday there are more people believing it is a store of value and holding long term. Myself included I came for the profits but stayed for the tech and philosophy behind it.
If more and more people believe it is a store of value it will become a self fulfilling prophecy.

My only regret is not looking into Bitcoin sooner. I remember hearing about it from a friend in 2015 but they just said "oh it's internet money" and I didn't think much of it. 
I only really heard about it again when it was all over my Facebook feed in late 2017. It was obvious to me at the time it was a bubble as the price was going parabolic. But I found it interesting and wanted to look into the technology further.
As I went further and further down the rabbit hole of learning about Bitcoin I came to realize at 35yo I didn't know how money works, how governments and central banks work and how economies work.
I don't claim to fully understand all of those things now but I continue to learn and it's that knowledge that makes me believe in Bitcoin long term. I started DCA'ing every week a few months ago and also plan on holding for 10+ yrs.

What worries me is governments with unstable currencies just making bitcoin illegal to stop people from opting out of the national currency.
Would you still use Bitcoin if your country made it illegal?
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:17:33

"Bitcoin has no intrinsic value"
He will be saying the same thing when it's 200k
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:18:17
True, I guess when gold was used as a store of value and also as a currency people probably didn't just hodl it like we do with Bitcoin now thinking the value of it will go up over time.
Sounds like that's my exit strategy then. Hodl until mass adoption / low volatility then move capital gains into index funds. Maybe keep a decent Bitcoin allocation as a hedge against stock / currency crashes etc
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:06:04
Thank you, very interesting! A lot of economists think deflationary currencies don't work as people will just hold it and not spend. 
If people in poorer/high debt to GDP countries learn of this I wonder if we will see a lot of inflationary national currencies around the world fail at that point due to their citizens moving into Bitcoin?
It seems almost inevitable that if Bitcoin survives, scales and becomes stable that it will be the next world reserve currency.

@_date: 2019-05-26 12:38:49
I keep hearing that the price of gold is being suppressed and is only 1/4 of where it should be due to it being traded by paper. Is this true? Why don't the holders just do a "bank run" on gold?
 
Could Bitcoin face this issue in the future and be artificially capped?
