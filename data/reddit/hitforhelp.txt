Satoshi set the block size limit as a TEMPORARY measure to guard against spam in the early days based on suggestions from Hal Finley, it was always supposed to be lifted. They even provided ideas to how the blocksize should scale inline with moores law.    
Why is no one learning that from satoshi and forcing to keep blocks low and fees high?

I understand it all has to interact with the main chain to confirm but what if the scenario the poster above says becomes true. 


    
If this was the case they would never even use main chain BTC when they first bought Bitcoin. They would be buying Bitcoin already integrated into the LN. If fees continue to rise past say $20/txn some users may never even need/want to confirm on the main chain even if they had a problem as it could cost more in transactions to close than to accept a loss.

This whole post seems a bit like a troll if I'm honest. It's sad that you made a loss but you did make a silly decision by going all in instead of being diversified. If you had held them for that long you would have an equal amount of BCH surely that should be enough? You would then be sitting in a good place with both coins whichever the price goes. If you don't know how to trade Hodl.   
Now because of your mistakes you demonise the coin and the sub because of it. That's why I think you are a troll and should be called out when it is seen.

So you need to send yourself a transaction it seems to claim these coins.

@_date: 2017-12-22 01:45:45
Coinbase is an exchange like many others. Sadly right now the fees on Bitcoin are extortionate due to the blocks being full.  
If you are only into Bitcoin for the money I would not invest more than you can afford to lose. Rather than moving the coins keep them on an exchange for now (even though this is bad advice as you do not own your coins then) or you could look at other crypto to invest in such as Bitcoin cash, litecoin, ethereum, ripple etc.

To be honest I want to both BCH and BTC to win. Or which ever actually provides the best system. I try and remain neutral but over here I'm seen as a troll/shill/whatever.   
I've been in Bitcoin a good number of years and seen much drama come and go but at least to me and many others like the more original design decisions of BCH, the fact that we've been fighting a blocksize increase from a temporary 1mb spam limit is where the problem lies for me. People seem excited for segwit because it will allow people to buy things with their Bitcoin which has been lost due to the current high fees. Because of these Bitcoin is now being pushed as a store of value over an actual currency. segwit has been introduced which seems like an extra unnecessary step to fixing the issues when Satoshi had outlined how scaling should work. I like BCH as Bitcoin was always supposed to carry a history of every transaction on chain and it provides an instant upgrade to the problems faced. If the core devs weren't so against any proposal that they did not come up with then maybe we wouldn't have such a divided community and could have had 2mb+ blocks and segwit and received the best of both.   
Either way I have diversified into many other coins now when I was just holding BTC before as I want to make sure what ever wins good or bad I am prepared. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:45:23
Try bitstamp.com I have been using them in the UK for years.    
Bellow you complain about the fees. If you try and move a small amount of BTC you may find the current fees too high for you. If you are only getting into Bitcoin for the making of money instead of a love for crypto then I would be careful and be ready to take your profits or be ready to lose what ever is invested.

Ill admit this services interests me and if it was in the UK I would probably use it. While I currently do set aside some money weekly to put into bitcoin I like the idea of this service too. One of the reasons that I like it is that as long as im not struggling for money each month then I can afford to round each purchace up to the dollar and not even think about the item costing any more. For example, I got buy a tank of gas, I fill it up, comes to $34.51, rounding it to $35 wont break the bank for me and I wont notice the few pence missing. Then later I buy a meal, maybe a few snacks and a drink from the store and pay on card it soon becomes a couple dollars saved without me feeling like I have actually spent more. Its not so much having an issue psychologically with saving more just having an extra way to go about saving, I know some cards/banks already offer this feature with Fiat so it being avalible in bitcoin is all the more appealing to me.  
Not to mention for the noobies who want to get into bitcoin but dont feel comfortable spending money on bitcoin outright, or maybe do not have the money to put into bitcoin outright may also find this system very attractive. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:09:14

I work at a petrol/gas station in the UK and we are non-prepay. Yes we do have an issue with drive offs and people not paying for fuel in those situations. If we were wanting to set up a pre-pay system we would need to change all of our pump and our till systems. The sheer cost of upgrading outways the losses occurred from drive offs. To upgrade the pumps you would probably be looking at around £200k+ with labor minimum. Thats a heck of alot for a site that only makes around £150k/year profit. With our current losses from non-payments of fuel it would take around 50+ years for the losses of fuel to make up for the cost of the pumps.     
If you were creating an entirely new site then it may be worth considering but then the other issue you encounter is that you have to change the mindset of all the customers who (in the UK at least) are used to driving up to a pump getting out and filling up as apposed to pre-paying. Also I believe pre-pay would hurt shop sales which is where the majority of our revenue comes from.

Useful tool then. How would the wallet or IRS decide what Bitcoin is being spent. If you've got coins from 2012 sat in a wallet and up 10,000% but bought a few coins the day before buying a coffee and it's stayed the same value which coins are calculated? Or would it become and average total of all the coins value? If its an average should you then seperate coins each buying opportunity into individual wallets under the same private key.    
Whole lot of uncertainty involved currently.

If you were to sell something like that then it would be worth waiting for a few Confirmations first. 0-conf is more risky now since RBF (Replace By Fee) allows someone to spend a higher fee to have their transaction included in an earlier block. Still in the real world the actual risk of double spends is still very low.   
When then mempool becomes clogged then the risk of a double spend increases as there will be longer between confirmations unless a high fee is paid. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:42:43
Shame really, one the of the big selling points for me when I got into bitcoin was the idea of it being a global currency and being cheap enough for the worlds unbanked to be able to use it as currency.    
It would be nice for it to be viable for them in Venezuela but as you said with the mining they dont have good access to electricity. Also anyone that does get caught mining has been getting their miners confiscated which is a shame for anyone trying for a better option.

It's known as a CFD(Contract For Difference) where you don't own any of the Bitcoin or stocks but your money is used by the platform to bet/invest on which way the market is moving.   
It's known as a "Social trading platform" as you can do something they call "copy trades" this allows you to use your money to copy the buying/selling of stocks and crypto from other people. So if they make money you will also make money as you follow their trades.

Not so much but thanks for the offer. It's unlikely we are close enough for me to feel comfortable in the logistics of paying for the recovery.     
As others have said though you may have better luck with the USB drive if it's not completely destroyed. 
Is there a copy of the wallet file saved on the HDD as well as the SSD? If so that would probably have better chance of recovery.  
It's not backed up on a cloud storage system is it such as Dropbox, Google drive or iCloud?

It makes sense though doesn't it? From the point of a traditional merchant I mean. Bitpay is primarily a payment processor allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin/crypto for their services. Since they want to tie in directly to traditional banking systems by having crypto payments converted directly into fiat.    
This doesn't appeal to many of the Bitcoiners of course. They beauty of open source though is that you can always fork off and make a better non kyc bitpay alternative.

You can use a hardware wallet like a ledger with electrum which requires you to confirm sending on the ledger.   
This can act as a security buffer even with a compromised client.

I don't know. We all do stupid and lazy stuff sometimes, myself included. Keep your coins wherever you want but understand you can't get upset if they are lost because of something happening to the exchange. I was around for the Mt. Gox fiasco where people have lost hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin.    
It was also only a few weeks ago were a Canadian exchange operater died unexpectedly and the entire funds are stuck in coldstorage with no one knowing how to access them. 
I don't feel its conducive of good practice to even suggest for people to leave funds on an exchange. Or if they are going to do so then make sure its low amounts they could afford to lose and implement best security practices such as 2FA on both the exchange and email address. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:22:55
I was expecting it to be a fake website and when you login it shows the payment as processing and then they try to convince you to send the money over from your own wallet while waiting on that to arrive. Either way avoid these guys! Or have some fun with them and waste their time so they have less time to scam others.

Just ignore it and move on to build the best system we can do. Competition is healthy for everyone involved in crypto and should encourage us to do better. Personally I think people need to be careful on any exchange and research what they are buying into. If they cannot distinguish between two different cryptos then maybe they shouldn't be investing.

To me it seems helpful. With the current situation and confusion between BTC &amp; BCH its helpful to have both addresses registered under the same private key and wallet address incase someone accidentally sends you the incorrect funds. That way the coins would not be lost/stolen and could either be returned or used a part of the payment. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:00:46
The fact your restricted to how much of your coins you are allowed to withdraw is very concerning.

Not your keys not your coins. This is a mantra that has been pushed forever now and still remains true.   
While coin base may seem like a good place to store them they have had their issues in the past. Also should a hardfork occur on any chain he has coins coin base have been slow at providing those coins customers.   
OP should look into hardware wallet for storage.

It's not any one group of developers or users that get to decide what is Bitcoin but whichever has the longest chain of work. So if there is a hardfork or POW change that does not follow those rules it would be considered an altcoin.

They used to be free back in the day. There was a metric called "Bitcoin days destroyed" and was an indication of how many "old coins" have been moved. The idea was if you had coins that have not moved in a long time you could move them for free or with higher priority.

While I'm sure they do run their own miners at a point it makes sense for them to sell them too. In doing so you could create more miners than you can use giving additional money sooner to put towards either creating more miners faster or better miners.

Its not just about asking for bigger blocks for the sake of larger blocks. They want them because right now bitcoin can do 3tx/s. With segwit it can do max 5tx/s with 2mb segwit that doubles to 10tx/s max which should be more than enough currently to deal with the number of transactions which will mean faster confirmation times and lesser fees for everyone. Long term it would still need to be considered to increase blocksize along side other scaling solutions. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:51:40
But the issue is its not rare times the transaction fees are high, they have consistently been high for months now. I the original idea for bitcoin was to a unifying global currency that could be used by everyone. How is that possible if fees are more than some people in some parts of the world earn in day.

@_date: 2019-09-07 18:52:27
I would argue hash rate follows profitability and not necessarily the price. The price would be impacted by hash rates.    
The price could remain stable but profitability for miners would be worse unless they already have paid for their machines and getting cheap/free power. That would cause miners to leave the network as it would not make sense for them to mine at a loss.

If it starts with a 1 that will be your public address just like a mailing address in the real world anyone can send you post.   
To access those coins/post you need your private key this will let you open up that wallet/mailbox and retrieve what is inside. If you lost the private key it's not possible to access the funds.    
Be wary of people trying to "help" you recover the coins as they could be trying to rip you off. Do not share the private key with anyone.

I think for some people within crypto it's what they want to see. Obviously we will and should always have people who want to hold their own coins, but to many a crypto bank would be an attractive option.    
Here in the UK banks insure your money up to £75k so for some people having their crypto insured up to thag amount would be a positive thing for them.    
For others they would see the banks as a bad thing as they could make it more difficult for them to buy crypto anonymously.

I would lean towards the upper end of that scale, we can confirm with certainty that at least 2 million are lost or have been burnt deliberately (thanks mastercoin!).     
Satoshi also owns 1m~ coins so it's possible a massive percentage of the total supply is gone for good.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:07:58

Post it the other way round instead. Advertise that there is a 4% fee baked into the price and there is instead a discount for cash. E.G price is $10 or $9.60 for cash payments. Doing it this way would mean more people may just leave it as a tip instead as they feel they were already going to spend $10.

The tech is what got me excited and put money in to begin with and not just for profits.

May I enquire about how you may go about stopping the fraud issue? What methods would you have in place to stop chargebacks. You say that you verify who we are and that we are not using a stolen card however many savvy criminals will possibly see your system as a challenge. People have their whole identitys stolen and used to take out loans and other finical services what makes you so certian you can avoid this. Also the 5%+ $5 sounds better than 10%, if the price was to jump back to $250/BTC again or higher I do not fancy paying an extra $25 for the service.      
Also would this be considered a exhange for people to buy and sell coins or just coins? the biggest issue for many is exchanging BTC to fiat.
Also  
@_date: 2013-06-16 19:56:06
Were they only avalible to be bought for bitcoins or were they able to be bought for cash? Because if they were bought for cash sure they may not pay them selves back right now in terms of cost of investment but the price of bitcoins could go up meaning it would eventually pay for itself. However paying in bitcoins it may never recoup that initial bitcoin investment paid for them because you would need each to mine 2BTC to pay for itself.

The thing is everyone can kick themselves for not investing or not doing something but you just have to accept it. You cannot change the past and what is done is done, it is now impossible to change. This holds true for everything in life and not just bitcoin. The regrets of not placing a bet on that horse you would have at the grand national, the hot girl who you were flirting with at the store. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. The only thing you can do is try better next time. I was going to invest in bitcoin a long time ago but a friend questioned me as to why and I didn't know enough at the time to be serious about it , hell I even started ming but then stopped because it wasn't profitable at the time and I considered it too to begin mining. I have a few coins saved (2.7) from when I bought some back at $15 each I did have 8 saved but periodically sold them and made double my initial investment.  Of course now im kicking myself but is what is done is done and this way I can learn from my mistakes next time. Is it worth getting a 2-3 gfx card rig at this point and hoping to make enough in the coming months or should I just invest the money into bitcoin instead and buy a ASIC when they ship.

Its entirely up to you if you belive it is worthwhile or not, My only advice would be have a look into it a little more doing some research on efficent setups. 
my only concern would be overheating your laptop by mining, if your electricicty is free/cheap and you could make profit (even if it is only $5/day) then go for it. However I would recommend reading up on 'Litecoins' and consider mining them and then just transfer them into BTC over at

Surely after the last block has been mined the miners would continue to mine because they are the backbone of the network and would thus then be paid by transaction fees.

Well you currently have credit cards which store you cash upon, you can take your phone around and transfer from your wallet on there.

Because for the game codes I was wanting to purchase they were the cheapest and actually one of the only sites offering them as codes. I could have gone through amazon but to do that they required account linking for each membership.

In the end I put the main issues down to my use of a VPN at the time of registration/purchase. It was just frustrating asking the support staff if my use of a VPN would cause issues and be given the same response of -

Due to blockchain.info shutting down their services with ping.it and debit card payments the most reliable way is to transfer your money with  and then  however this will still take a couple of days. If you want bitcoins now with paypal then you could try [eBay]( but be prepared to pay a big markup. If you are patient enough to wait you could make money buying coins and selling on ebay for a markup.

I had attempted to use  over the last couple of months for some game cards. Sadly, somewhere along the process of attempting to make a purchase my Debit/credit/paypal were all declined and no reasons given. 
After trying to contact support and being told multiple times that they could no reveal any information as it would allow people to by pass their anti fraud systems. So in desperation to try and get my account authorized I sent them a Photo of my drivers license. Yet they refused to accept this. So here I was after 2+ months of attempting to buy game codes and dealing with their awful customer support I finally notice that they now accept bitcoin! Hooray! 
I place my order and chose to pay with bitcoin. I send through the payment with bitcoin and 5 mins later I have received my codes. Bitcoin saves the day. 
**TL;DR:** Refused sale at PC game supply. Support staff awful at support. Bitcoin comes to save the day after 2months of headaches.

BUYER BEWARE. Many bad reports coming out of BITINSTANT today. read around what people are saying before giving them any more money. Good to hear good reports from other exchanges still.

Everyone is thinking the same thing though. I was going to invest $100 at the time but friend talked me out of it because it was so early on. Only thing to do now is invest again and hope.

the 7970's can each get around 600mh/s so you would be looking at around 1200-1300 with overclocks. using [this profitability mining calculator]( it looks like you will get around 0.04 - 0.06 BTC /24hrs which would currently be around $6/24hours. The laptop wouldn't cut it as the most efficient mining is done on high end graphics cards and even they are being phased out now. 
Edit: i realized that laptop has the 7970 DOH! ATI cards are better at mining than nvida cards, the 560ti will get around 100mh/s compared to 600mh/s of a ATI 7970

you should have a look on 'The silk road' While yes it is used mainly for distribution of illegal substances there are also many legal products avalible on there. Have a look in the 'money' section of the website and there are people selling re loadable Virtual creditcards.

I have, they save you money by transferring your money at mid market rates so the money you put in is then exhange with another users money reducing the fees of transfer.

This right here is some interesting advice.  
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:03:08
Do it as an investment into the long term future of bitcoin. Start mining and then what ever you mange to make keep it. If you do manage to make some coin from it perhaps even tip the person who you got the free cards from as a thankyou. It may pay off for them in future.

Right now the cost is 0.0015BTC. For anyone that has been holding bitcoin longer than 6months that amount isnt a particularly spectacular amount that is going to break the bank. For anyone having bought it at $1000 well $1.50 is not going to break the bank to spread the love and show the power of bitcoin.

Best suggestion would be to use another wallet if you cannot find a fix. Electrum is a pretty good wallet.

Actually by law in the USA and UK you are allowed to cancel and get a refund even for a short time after the order is marked as shipped so seeing as tracking is not yet working you could claim now.

No actually a light year is a measure of distance. As it is the distance light will travel in 1 earth year. 
The speed of light is approx 300,000km/s or 186,282 miles/s. So you multiply that by the amount of seconds in a year, and you get how big a light year is. A light year is just under 10 trillion kilometres, or 6 trillion miles.

For anyone wanting to do international transfers rather than using your bank to do it try using  I  bought coins from them transfering my money from GBP to EUR then sending coins to Bitstamp who transfer them to USD for free.

Craps seems like a slightly more uncommon casino game. Im not even sure how to play it to be honest with you. Is there any skill to it and what are the odds like?

did he not put an alias or identifier for the account? Yes there is the 20characher hash that you refer to but it should have asked for an account name of some sort. For example if you put your alias as "yanDitto" it may look like a 20character hash but it will work when you type yanDitto into it.

Bought back in at end of last bubble, bought 2+BTC at $250 just in time to watch it crash less than 1hour later! I held onto them and then when we had this rise i was kicking myself for selling out around the $500 mark when it rose to $1200, im in it for the long haul now, try to sitback and just appreciate that you have those few coins now and even though they were bought at high price there is still hope for them. People who bought at $250 where devestated when it crashed, however now everyone would still love to buy coins at $250

With the price being so high currently is it worth building a 2-3 GFX miner or waiting on an ASIC to start shipping. That or invest the money into bitcoins now instead.

Exchange them for Fiat money or use services to pay bills or buy goods. Or buy a credit card which can be reloaded with bitcoin. So no bitcoins are not useless to him at all.

In team fortress people refer to "Pocket Medics" when the medic only heals the one player, this can result in game winning situations if you have a a good medic team combo. 
Good combinations for medic combos are medic+heavy, medic+demo man etc.

I was shocked myself, order was placed around 17:20 on a weds and money was in the account by 14:30 on the thursday. I was very surprised as bitstamp processes payments in 1-3 working days, my first transaction with them was 5days to go through.
