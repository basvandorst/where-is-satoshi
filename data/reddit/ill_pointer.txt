Even if you can get ahold of a 3rd-batch Avalon, you don't know what batches 1 and 2 will do to the market.

Why in the world don't you just use cloud hosting so you can quickly scale up resources on the fly when traffic spikes?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:00:39
USD is relevant to the value of every currency in the world. Bitcoin will not change this. USD has to actually collapse of its own accord before it stops affecting Bitcoin value.
Them's just facts.

Welp. Bitcoin's doomed.

If I opened an e-commerce site that accepted Bitcoin tomorrow, my prices would be based on a 30 or 60 day average instead of today's or yesterday's exchange rate. Problem solved.
People might be upset because, according to MtGox or BTC-e, they think their BTC are worth more than I'd be offering, but it would introduce a semblance of stability into the BTC economy.
And that's really what it needs.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:29:14
Probably not on the rolling average Mt.Gox provides. But those placed orders can affect 3rd party charts, other bots' algorithms, and general human flock behavior.

Has anyone stopped to consider that you all might, not being traditional investors, be completely inept at reading and interpreting charts?

I wouldn't worry about it. Average Joe's exchange would probably fall apart under regular web traffic even before anyone started trying to actually trade on it.

Don't listen to these guys. They are wrong. Get out. Put the money into something more stable. They all have wild-eyed dreams of becoming billionaires, which is totally unrealistic.
You've made your money. Now protect your money.
No one, ever, would advocate that you put all your liquid assets into a single company's stock. Not even if that company is Apple.
You made a nice, low risk gamble before any of them got bit by the get-rich-quick bug, and it paid off. Enjoy your spoils while you still can.
These people telling you to hold are investment plebians. Get out. You've earned it.
EDIT: Even in more traditional and stable investment portfolios, they recommend that you re-balance your diversification. So previously, 99% of your assets were in the bank, 1% were in Bitcoin. Now because of Bitcoin growth, 99% of your assets are in Bitcoin. You have to rebalance. These other people have next to nothing to lose compared to you. Just cash most of it out and bring your financial investments back into balance. Maybe hold onto $10k worth or something.

Are we all ready to admit yet that the problem is just Bitcoin platforms hacked together by amateurs who don't know how to write scalable software?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:34:44
All these things are true, but bots are just a thing you have to accept as inevitable in an exchange. Automated trading is the future. If Bitcoin wants to be the currency of the future, it has to be able to dealwithit.gif

DDoS? I guess that's a much more convenient explanation than pointing out that most Bitcoin services software is amateurishly written and unscalable in the event of actual web traffic...
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:07
I would not doubt that people have automated trading scripts that spam 0.1 BTC transactions, but that smells more of someone trying to exploit volatility and manipulate prices to their favor than an attempt at DoS. Happens on the stock exchange all the time. Bitcoiners' biggest enemies are each other, not the government.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:15:17
I wasn't suggesting things won't improve. I was merely suggesting that the current state of Bitcoin services is mainly unprofessional garbage and detrimental to the ecosystem.

Repeat after me: MARKET TIMING IS A STATISTICALLY FAILING STRATEGY.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:03:28
Another idiot advocating for market timing, a proven failure of an investment strategy.
If you're gonna gamble, gamble right...
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:01:35
All signs point to amateur-hour web app developers who can't handle natural traffic spikes.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:12:45
If you wanted to "buy into" Bitcoin as an investment, you're part of the problem, and the ecosystem is better off without you.

Corollary: Only give money to Butterfly Labs that you can stand to be scammed out of.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:19:14
That's not dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging would be putting a set amount of USD into BTC at a set interval regardless of which way you think things will go. When you say "buy again now" you are just advocating a market timing strategy, which will fail.
"I'll put $50 into BTC per week" &lt;-- a real dollar cost averaging strategy
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:59:18
I call shenanigans on DDoS attacks. People just need to write better software so they don't get Slashdotted when the market starts moving.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:33
If you really wanna support Bitcoin, go buy something with it. People hoarding currency as investment is the problem that state-issued fiat exists to prevent.

Discussion has mostly revolved around open source exchange software, which makes it auditable. Hardware is a consideration for individuals who actually want to host exchange software, and cloud hosting platforms can largely take away a lot of that complexity (see  so I fail to see the problem here. Do you have the slightest insight into whether or not MtGox and other exchanges are truly secure? Nope. Closed code. Not auditable.
Personally I'd like to see 2 roles be separated: 1. Order matching. 2. Escrow.
Matching servers (or a distributed matching network) to find people matching orders that have a preferred escrow service in common. Escrow service APIs to actually execute the transaction.
I fail to see why anyone should wait to start making these things a reality.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:45
I mean, when I go to a Bitcoin-related site and they have a big message that says "Please be patient, we're moving to another server" it's clear that there's a lot of amateur-hour going on.
Amazon EC2 or Heroku or one of the other 12532162314 cloud hosting platforms would have been able to handle that traffic load.
None of this was a targeted DDoS attack. People merely saw Bitcoin was moving and started running to the charts, forums, and exchanges all at once.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:13:04
Market timing does not work. In any market. That said, I think BTC hasn't hit the floor yet. $120 USD/BTC is probably more realistic. Anything above $150 right now is going to induce another drop for sure.

The orders don't have to be filled in order to have an effect.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:37:21
Protip  If you don't even know what the term "dollar cost averaging" means, you should read about investing before you invest in something this volatile.

I don't really have a question. I just wanted to point out that even if development goes ahead in Node.js (which makes sense given the I/O heaviness of the problem domain), Node.js is bad at computation. And if someone runs into a need to do heavy computation (which hogs the event loop, seriously degrades Node.js performance), your low-level dev skills would be seriously helpful for breaking out computational pieces into native extensions. Node.js can call a native extension written in C/C++ and then let other events do their work while it waits on the result.
Edit: Whoops, thought I was in the buttercoin subreddit, hence the Node.js babble.
