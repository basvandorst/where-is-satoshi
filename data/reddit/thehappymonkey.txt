that'd be a great way to expose more people to bitcoin.

i've always pondered this.

who says they got all of his bitcoins? don't put all your eggs in one basket.

yea, the title sounded like something generic so I didn't read it. I read it when I saw your title because it sounded interesting.

yea that was really appealing to me as well, if I had AMD graphics cards i'd be mining LTC but it seems to me that LTC mining is probably more decentralized than BTC mining is atm. it seems the only reason people hate it is because it's not bitcoin. I think they'll both find their places/niches.

gavin said there would be multiple bubbles, I was really starting to get anxious waiting for this one to pop.

why does everyone here hate litecoins? I mean, it is a little different than bitcoin and is imo a pretty good cryptocurrency, why does everyone hate it?

you're an awesome bot.

it airs everyday too! 'the senate homeland security council has called a meeting on bitcoin, will it ban bitcoin, or set regulatory standards? will BFL ever get sued for their practices? will mtgox ever start doing withdraws? will bitcoin keep rising to the moon or plummet down? which site will be hacked for all of it's bitcoins next? TUNE IN TOMORROW FOR AN EXCITING DAY IN THE LIFE OF BITCOIN!'

i'm one of those who are only here for the show, I only own .5 bitcoins and I check this subreddit everyday, been following it since it was 20 dollars. it's some of the best drama ever.
