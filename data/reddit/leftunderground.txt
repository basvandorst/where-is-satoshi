He was also never in possession of those tickets. So he could have offered any amount he wanted, since he didn't actually have anything.

Are you saying that about people that call themselves PHP developers (as opposed to just developers) are or you saying that PHP is a bad language that can't run properly for large mission critical systems? 
Here is a list of the top 40 sites and the code base they use:
Personally I'd rather code in PHP than Java, .NET or Python. I think that's just personal preference on my part, but I don't think PHP has any significant disadvantages over them.

I've seen PIC chip code written in C from a "developer" with an electrical engineering degree where I shit you not all the variables in the code were "$var1, $var2, $var3, etc... ". This is a guy where his career was based around computer science and this code was meant to interact with a computer's PCI bus (through a additional chip). 
I think PHP gets a bad rep because it is meant to be a very high level language which people confuse that to mean that it's a very easy and inefficient language; which is not true or fair. 
There very well may be developers that call themselves PHP developers because that is their main area of focus. I don't think they should be judged by that; I think they should be judged on their work.

This is pretty fucking amazing if true, but why would Ross be a free man? He still committed crimes, even if you can argue he was set up.

Do you mind if I ask you if you ever lived in the Vancouver area?

Thanks! However, I must admit you're killing our entertainment. What am I going to do with all this popcorn? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:14:04
Interesting. I'm going to get the popcorn ready. I have to admit, when I read the title I thought "yeah, right!". But reading the actual statements made by DHS it's kind of mind blowing.

They weren't just serving links, they were hosting the trackers. Right or wrong it's mich different than just hosting links.

Google serves links, The Pirate Bay connects millions of users in a way that allows them to share copyrighted content. I agree with you that technically they aren't hosting the content, but I don't agree that they are just hosting links. If that argument made sense then Napster in 2000 would have been just fine, since they also weren't technically hosting content. However, that battle was fought a long time ago and unfortunately Napster lost.

I'm not the person you responded to but you need to ask for 3 valid attack vectors? Magnet/torrent links are processed directly by uTorrent from the web browser. If there is any kind of bug in that process it would be extremely easy to exploit especially since on many systems you don't even need any kind of confirmation before clicking on a torrent link.
I don't know when uTorrent started adding the remote stuff (such as remote functionality) but lots of attack vectors there.
Finally, man in the middle attacks are always a possibility. 
Using outdated software when there are clear secure alternatives is silly. Here is just a small number of public CVEs relating to uTorrent (from remote code execution to memory overflow):

It is done so money doesn't go back to the days of the wild west. It helps prevent offshore tax shelters, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Whether you think that's good or not is up to you, but there are reasons you need an ID and a social to open up a bank account. And the idea that bitcoin or any other coin or exchange market will get you around that isn't realistic. The government will regulate anything that had success as currency, that's the world we live in. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:52:00
You can argue it's not a good thing, but there are lots of reasons for why that is the case. And I would argue they are good reasons. 
And your solution is another scam coin? I don't know what ripples is, am I misunderstanding that it's another altcoin? How is that a solution?

Who's spying on who? 
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:25:22
They are doing it for regulatory reasons. You can't open a bank account without an ID. Same principal applies here. They aren't directly spying on you, but they are required by law to identify you (and yes, they can share it with thr government if they request your info). If you don't like it open up your own service and see how far you get.

This is the problem I have with libertarian thinking. I don't mean this as an insult. The financial cris was such a fuck up of greedy governments and corporations it exposed corruption throughout the system and that this system can't be corrected. So the argument automatically becomes that the system should be completely removed. Yes, we had  2008, just as we had 1988. But we also had crash after crash in the 1800s, just like we had the great depression when regulations were much more lax. 
There is no perfect system. But no system is even more fucked up.

You're comparing apples to boots.
Openstack has lots of system admins that hate it, check out But really that's besides the point, you are comparing technologies that are meant to be used by professionals in the computer field as opposed to something that is supposed to be used by average consumers. I don't get your point. Bitcoin adaptation has been steady and consistent. Just like we look back at 2010 and wish we had gotten in then people back then could have never imagined that it would take off in the way it did. Just about everyone I talk to in the real world has heard of bitcoin in some capacity even if they don't fully understand it. Many of those same people have no clue what Linux is, let alone what iptables or openstack is.

People are downvoting it because you keep spamming the same bullshit all over the place and when confronted it is clear that you have no clue as to what you are talking about. I'm not sure why I'm even indulging you, you're an obvious troll.

The stock image of the guy being all stoked about Bitcoin is hilarious. Reminds me of the "yeah, business!" meme. Gotta love India.

That doesn't seem right. 225Kw is a giant amount of power, especially for a single rack. The gauge of the wire to carry that much energy would have to be insane since it's unlikely they are using high voltage.
