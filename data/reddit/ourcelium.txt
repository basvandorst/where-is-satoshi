So lets consider the worst case: The pool operator simply doesn't include his own spam transactions. How is a single pool operator going to prevent another pool from including his transactions in the next block? Also, once they're in the mempool, I don't think they leave for like 60 days. That's a lot of confirms potentially by another pool.
Upvotes because I like your train of thought and the fact that you're vigilant for weaknesses. You are the reason Bitcoin is getting more resilient, but I don't think this theory is realistic after thinking it through.

B) Buy if you think this commodity is overvalued.
C) Do nothing or educate yourself if you're indecisive.

At $30/transaction like we've seen, you're talking about at least $100/second ($8 million a day). Makes me wonder if the people crying "spam" have really thought it through.
Eventually, after Segwit and LN are standard features, we're going to have to face the fact that the Bitcoin Cash people were right, but perhaps just had their priorities out-of-order. 1MB is not the correct answer. It's just an anti-spam number Satoshi put in as a band-aid, and they jumped the gun and tried to make that priority 1 rather than go through the growing pains we did.
The "correct" block size is a very real thing, but will to be tough to determine because there's no way to tell how many users are actually using the network, versus spammers, bots, etc. But ideally it would be something like targeting transactions of around $2, since opening a LN channel is most closely like to putting money in a checking account to pay bills, so to compete with banks we need to be somewhat cheaper than a checking account, and I think $4/month (or whatever the typical settlement period is) is probably cheaper than most people who use banks are used to.

Decentralized is subject to attacks. What we need is an accountability chain, like redditors with very few posts have much smaller fonts, or are almost as white as the background and hard to see, and the more credible a redditor becomes, the "louder" their opinion gets. Also, the admins should be monitoring for user account farming, which they probably are but rarely enforce.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:10:27
Thanks for the explanation, but I understand how LN works. My point is that the ultimate number of *settlements* (I chose the word carefully) ends up the same if the block chain is periodically pruned, and I think, but I'm not sure, that LN just moves the bandwidth problems around. Am I missing some math?
Another concern I did not mention in the post is that it just stands to reason that any block chain's value will go down as the size increases, simply because it's so hard to store. Pruning will be essential at some point. Even if that's 50 years down the road. Our user base will have to eventually come to grips with block chain consolidation.

Pruning - thanks. I knew that term and forgot it. That's already support on non-fully validating nodes. So that addresses half my post. The other half is how moving the bandwidth load to another network, presumably hosted by the usual suspects, will resolve the bandwidth problem.

Nope - that would require a massive cooperative effort on the part of the entire pool, since the reward is spread to all of them. The people running the pool would be effectively giving the pool members their money. Interesting thought though.

But still, how does someone with less than 50% of the hashing power guarantee their spam transaction won't get committed by another pool? I'm trying to compile lightning network daemon and I've hit my mid-morning mental low. Walk me through it if you still think it could really happen.

If you're asking, yes. Bitcoin's code base can be changed to assimilate any real innovation. A buddy of mine copied the code base, branded it, did an ICO, and made tens of thousands for basically no effort. Why wouldn't there be hundreds or even thousands of others doing the same thing? There are plenty of suckers to dangle something shiny in front of.

They all are. The value is in the original block chain concept, and concensus. Bitcoin is free open source software, and if developers were interested in furthering the cause, they'd be working on preserving concensus, not whoring out their mini test nets. The real value in them is the fact that it's so easy to wrap suckers up with a distraction. That strategy won't pan out in the long run.

I don't see it as ideological. You're assuming that the precedent can be set that consensus just hops from coin to coin, but think about what that really means for crypto: Not knowing which coin is going down the drain because of concensus hopping. Instead of reinventing FOSS and hoping for a better result, the focus should be on applying those improvements that truly are improvements to the original malleable innovation and preserving concensus.
We both know what's really happening is that people know this, and are ignoring it to make a quick buck. That's the elephant in the room, although the reason nobody calls them on it is because it is obvious and you can only call it out so much.

Most of the recent adopters don't see it this way, but I'm with you. The US government just printed another trillion and a half (so to speak) and the government may shut down anyway. I'd rather just have an algorithm keep things fair across-the-board than let blatantly irresponsible groups of people devalue my life savings.

Has it occurred to nobody else that if Bitcoin truly fails despite being open source, it means no technical solution to the cause of failure exists, and therefore all other cryptocurrencies will fail for the same reason?
You don't want Bitcoin to fail, unless you're just trying to circumvent the risk the early adopters took and turn a quick profit. This is why I can't respect any posts propping up alt currencies. I immediately see through all the BS and this is what's left. There's still plenty of risk/reward to go around. Get on board man.

Unless you specifically go out and seek knowledge of how the US dollar is manipulated, you live most of your life blindly accepting that it isn't, and since we're all indoctrinated into using it from birth, this is a big deception for anyone who isn't printing it. People expect their medium of exchange to hold value until they learn that it doesn't. I suspect if they didn't print on the bills that they were "backed" by things, this wouldn't be such a big deal. But it is.
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:10:17
What does this do to a Bitcoin recipient? Do they have to wait for a confirm to even see that the transaction took place, rather than get instant gratification and then a confirmation after 10 minutes? If so, I don't like it.

The latency would really only hurt martian miners. They could host full nodes that would be about a block or two behind, and they could definitely broadcast transactions, but they'd have to sit on incoming bitcoin for like an hour before they tried to spend it because two or three confirmations might get overwritten fairly regularly.
Now if we're assuming their bandwidth sucks, then you run in to the whole great firewall of china scenario all over again and, yeah, you could end up with a split-brain fork - all the nodes on the martian side (assuming most mining power remains on Earth) would be subject to being 51% attacked by stuff like interplanetary DDoS.

Sweet Jesus. I like Bitcoin as much as the next Bitcoiner, but don't you think you might be in a state of denial if you're already posting that it's in recovery? And perhaps a state of manipulating people if you post like this is some official article from an authority on the subject?
Who cares what the price is right now unless you plan to sell right now? If a whale is unloading, the price will recover. If it's being actively manipulated, the price will recover once the manipulators run out of steam.

At first I thought this was a dumb suggestion and would quickly collapse to a fractional reserve system, but then I realized you could print a unique public key on each note and it could be quickly verified against the blockchain, so this idea actually has serious merit. Counterfeit notes could be printed, but instead of the usual marker they use at the gas station when you pass a $50 or $100 bill, they'd just scan the public QR on the note to validate its worth.
I guess Lightning kinda uses this concept as a building-block (no pun intended), but without paper.
One possible exploit would be if the style of the note was easy for anyone to print (e.g. just a QR code on printer paper), someone could print a ton of counterfeits with the same QR code on all, and nobody would know it. However, you could argue that if there was an equivalent to all the US anti-counterfeiting tech in each note, as well as a Bitcoin equivalent to the Secret Service, this idea would work at least as well as any other paper currency today, and probably better since it's not inflationary.
I just realized also (sorry for the one-man back-and-forth) that you could have a registry of valid QRs for your country, like a federal node, and have it give an indication of when someone last checked a QR code so you'd know right away if someone had a duplicate of yours simply because it **should** only be checked when it legit changes hands and any other checks would indicate fraud. Sort of like buying a car and going to the title agency - if the mileage is lower than the last time it was sold, then someone fucked with it.
But that last thought means now it's traceable and people can see when you spend the money they gave you. That could be exploited somehow... Maybe you could limit the number of queries a person could perform against the federal database, but then you'd be limiting how fast people could spend money in your digital country, which limits freedom.
I'm definitely going to be up all night thinking about this. Good suggestion brah.

I'm a libertarian sysadmin with gray hair. Hell yes I was around for Bitcoin in 2013. Right now Reddit is being rendered by a Radeon GPU I never would have bought at any other time in history and justified by mining on it. Is that enough street cred for you?
The common big mistake of 2013 was investing in mining hardware instead of buying the currency. At the time of the big crash, Bitcoin was new, a 90% drop was new, everything was new, without precedent. Now nothing is new. Bitcoin is an easy sell to your significant other (hey that's different and it matters!) Would you dump yours if it dropped back to $5k? The precedent suggests that the price will rise over time, and outperform the stock market by orders of magnitude. Human beings move the Ouija board that is the price, but they don't do so in a vacuum. People remember this shit and trade accordingly.
When I initially appraised the value of a Bitcoin, I came up with $1.5 million USD. That was in 2013. I have yet to see anything that affects that appraisal (It was fairly comprehensive). $9700 is a great buy price for an open source global deflationary currency.

If you're running something that important, allow me to introduce the concept of [n+1 redundancy]( I think the idea of a watchtower is meant to give you some form of this but I'd be really interested to hear if anyone has already architected a two or three node lightning rig with full redundancy.

You gotta watch the terminology before you get bent out of shape about it - the network itself worked as expected. This is a classic case of client not robust enough, but some people on here are going to celebrate, because their share of code worked perfectly. It's to be expected.
The hard part is going to be how to determine which client isn't going to have problems like this. "State" is a new concept for clients which previously just had the state of a 12 word seed which users knew to back up somewhere. The best solution for how to handle state in this case will be obvious in hindsight.
As an aged software developer and IT guy, I like to see as little state as possible kept on a client (e.g. your smart phone) specifically because catastrophic failures are common on clients. But then there's the issue of trust - do you back your LN state up to a cloud, where it could be tampered with? To an exchange? You don't want to only have it on your phone, like ever. The moment funds change hands, that state should be written to their phone's internal storage, copied to their SD card, AND copied to a server somewhere so it can't be lost easily if the phone is dropped in a lake. The question is: Where? Perhaps that's up to each client. Google, Facebook, etc. already solved this, but the current trend is that they are proving to be untrustworthy. Your average software dev is just autistic enough not to think through real world conditions thoroughly.
Data loss (usually from hardware failure) is *exactly* the problem that will exist around LN until the state problem is addressed elegantly, but just like HD wallets manifested to solve this the first time around, it will be solved. Just a matter of time.

It will never drop to zero. Its value manifested in a vacuum and bearing its open-source nature and sheer concensus, someone will always find a use for it. That's the problem with valuating it though: It's either worth zero, or a hell of a lot more than X (X being whatever the current value is)

Yeah, horse and buggy didn't "fall apart" so much as people gradually switched to automobiles just because they're superior. I fully expect Bitcoin to do the same for currency.
My favorite thing about Bitcoin is that a normal person invariably asks "What gives it value?" and the correct response is something they've never thought of: "But wait... what gives your favorite currency value?" leading normal, every day people to start seeing the huge drawbacks of government-backed fiat currencies. The very source of a lot of macroeconomics' modern problems.

The current price reflects the fact that we hit a huge stumbling block: Scalability. The future price will reflect whether we surmount it or not. Being that it's a technical problem and a 10TB SSD and 1Gbps internet pipe doesn't seem like an impossible dream any more, I'm guessing that one way or another this problem will be solved in the near future, lightning or not. I noticed that bcash's value went up the past couple days. I wonder if someone knows more than me on where things stand with lightning and whether it will actually fix the scalability problem.

Not sure why you got downvoted. That's actually a good idea. It might be a rehash of an old idea of "side chains" or something though, hence you rubbed someone the wrong way. It solves the problem of a guaranteed-to-exist, neutral location to keep the volatile channel state.
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:32:46
If we had the option of choosing between onchain and LN on-the-fly, smart people would count on periodic network attacks and just use LN by default, then just schedule closing a channel when the network is slow and it's cheap to do so. Malicious users throwing a spam tantrum would literally just be shoveling their money in to the hands of the miners. Ta da! Anti-fragile.
Come to think of it, the only people that lose in this situation are the full node operators who have to store dem blox forever. We need some kind of concensus-driven permanent pruning. I know pruning is a thing on validation nodes, but is there any discussion whatsoever to make it a full-node thing? I run a node and I'm all for this.

They'll be the best at obtaining it, no doubt, but it's not debt based, and can't be printed, so the typical situation that happens now where congress passes a spending bill and borrows to give a cash infusion to their lobbyists will go away. That's the important part for me. I am sick of working hard for tainted, rigged, gamed money. I get that at first glance, if the supply of money is increased everyone's money becomes worth less, so it looks like an equal playing field, but there's a huge first mover advantage that is easily overlooked:
If I'm a drunkard and congress prints me a million bucks to go spend at an irish pub, so I start buying everyone drinks, soon everyone in the pub has tens of thousands and a beer costs a couple grand, but I am still the generous patron who bought everyone drinks in the first place. Nevermind that to cover my initially insurmountable debt, all I have to do now is sell a few hundred beers, assuming I ever intend on paying the debt.

Bitcoin: Free Open Source Software (FOSS), mutable codebase, and a community who's **primary objective** is demonstrably keeping it decentralized and unassailable, despite it hurting the price recently as they developed a second layer (lightning networks, being rolled out now) to make it work *with* that objective in mind, rather than abandoning it for a quick buck.

You're right, that doesn't mean that it won't be replaced, but why would it (be replaced)?
The only appeal it has is that it is the truly neutral currency of the future that can't be manipulated or supplanted by even the biggest players' efforts. If the community has enough foresight to know the most likely ways that might not become true and avoid them, why on earth would one of the plethora of premined money grabs supplant it? The elephant in the room is that there is no way to hide the obvious profit motive behind each and every one of them. They're tainted. They're not neutral. Whereas the original Bitcoin community were simply trying to build a 21st century currency. There was no profit motive back in 2009. It was just monopoly money and a dream. Every single altcoin can be traced back to a developer who cloned the Bitcoin code base, rebranded it, tweaked it, premined it, and ICO'd. Where are Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney now?
There's no way to hide the greed of altcoins, and it's yet another reason why Bitcoin is really, truly a great invention.

You're trying to put the genie back in the bottle. You don't look back when you are progressing. Microsoft and Steam don't want to go back, and I don't blame them. This is the kind of stupid sentimental bullshit I'm seeing all over this subreddit now that the sky is falling.
Relax, everything will be fine, but it's going to take longer than you hope. The **future** of Bitcoin is a back-end to the lightning network. It's going to be a few months (at least) before this tech begins earning the trust it will deserve. There's still at least one major gotcha that needs addressed:
As far as I can tell, the biggest problem is that the client now has to deal with channel state information, which is a job that should be on a server, but putting info like that on a server undermines the trustless nature of the whole thing, so we're back to square one. Nobody can make a straightforward, usable client with the actual benefits of a digital currency (e.g. your money is an abstract concept that isn't tied to a device) without solving this problem first.
That doesn't mean it won't work out. Technical problems always have technical solutions, and this is the first generation of software devs who are aware of trustless technology, making them qualified to solve this simple problem. It just means the necessary hoops must be jumped through by our fearless devs before the price chart starts mooning again. I envision an outcome where a trustless solution for lightning manifests so someone can't lose their channel state and bitcoin by dropping their phone in a lake. Not because it's possible, but because it's necessary.
In the mean time, I suggest you take advantage of the fire sale. I am. :)

On further review, I had a rounding error in my math.
On a serious note, there's not like a Bitcoin spider (like Google's search engine uses), so how do they even know how many nodes are out there without voluntary reporting from node operators? For example, I run a full node and it never showed up on the global node map sites until I manually fed my IP address into it. I'm just curious if these stats are even founded on something solid, since my node was invisible until I reported my IP.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:47:57
One of the many "antifragile" benefits of Bitcoin - Even under Lightning Networks you have to put money in before you can spend it. It's literally more substantial than USD because you can't just make it up. Nobody can get "addicted to debt" using a currency that has to exist before you can spend it.

Loaning *costs* money in a deflationary economy, so you wouldn't have anywhere near as much of it going on as our current economy does. The corollary for a savings and loan would literally be the polar opposite - a "borrow and spendings".
Instead of convincing you to borrow $50k now for college as soon as you turn 18 and have signing power, they'd find other ways of convincing *you to loan them* a half a Bitcoin for 10 years *as payment* for college. As stupid as that sounds, think about all the kids who are borrowing a lifetime worth of money to make an extra $10k/year. It's the same amount of stupid. So you get your half bitcoin back minus interest with the understanding that it will be worth roughly the same as what you put in to it.
Your brain is already programmed to do all these mental gymnastics in an inflationary world, so you don't notice all the irrationality that's already going on. The big deal is that nobody controls Bitcoin so nobody is born in to a rigged system. The playing field is level for all competitors.

You understand the concept, but you're mixing concepts - All Bitcoin *really* gets us is neutral money where nobody can rig it. It could be *inflationary* (e.g. dogecoin) and still get us that.
The original question asked was about loaning money, and that has nothing to do with sovereignity. It only has to do with inflationary or deflationary, and I just pointed out that the concept of taking out a loan, which is ubiquitous in our inflationary world, might not look anything like it does now.

When I wrote that I didn't think through the proven fiscal irresponsibility of the individual... Perhaps they'd be less irresponsible in a deflationary scenario and presumably all have a positive bitcoin balance to pay for things, and be troubled to give loans by big corporations kinda like what I outlined?
I honestly don't know, but I do know that it would change the economic culture enough that:
a. We of this inflationary global experiment would have trouble imagining the daily life of someone in that deflationary global experiment.
b. It'd be pretty obvious in hindsight what it would look like, because a lot of the concepts we are already familiar with would simply be inverted. (e.g. corporations taking loans from individuals instead of loaning to them, maybe)
In the mean time, I'm just having fun speculating. The bottom line is that money now is worth more than money later in our world, but this is definitely not true in the global deflationary world, so the idea of a loan is going to be very, very different, and probably not ubiquitous like in our world.

Normally I'd agree with you, but you're leaving out a few critical components: This guy is a very rich investor. People who have money pay attention to him, like lampreys on a shark. If Bitcoin was a thing that had a predetermined value, you'd be absolutely right. But you have to realize: He's determining the value right now. We all are. He's just in a better position to do so than you or me.
People who don't flinch when the bubble "pops" are the ones who lock value into Bitcoin. The rest of us have little control and mostly just get to take their faith for granted. This guy might end up worth more than Jeff Bezos if he's right, and he probably is.

The last time I got audited they ended up mailing me a check for the $600 they owed me, plus interest. I never said I don't pay my taxes. I just said if given the opportunity not to participate in their system, It would be a no-brainer.

No. My car has headlights and police obfuscate societal problems, not fix them. I can't think of anything worse than dealing with the problems of mankind, except a false sense of security that I don't have to.

Or I can see them for what they are but not allow them one iota more control over me than I have to. I'm sure slaves adopt a similar approach. I pay taxes to avoid escalation, but I don't pretend that it's voluntary or take any pride in it, nor do I espouse any patriotism. I'd flip on them in a minute if they lost the upper hand and their successor had any more appeal. Change your government like your underwear. This one's stale and shit-stained. I don't want them strip searching my kids when they want to get on a plane, or secretly (until Snowden came along) eavesdropping on their private communications. I wanted them to put locks on the cockpit doors after 9/11 so we could all just move on and forget about it.
I don't even want yet another war that was started simply because the president was being dragged through the mud. Syria used chemical weapons so we're bombing them? Why aren't we bombing [Israel]( It's because Trump was about to go down for conspiring with his lawyer over Stormy Daniels.

Ad hominem. I want to hear why he's wrong in this case. I don't really give a shit who he is. I wish Reddit had a button for when dipshits like you post basic logical fallacies without adding anything. Also a "something something" filter. I could do without a single one of those comments ever.

I never understood that about this sub. I have to sift through 12 articles that look something like this:
*Bitcoin To Go To One Billion Dollars Next Month - Bona-fide Financial Expert* (source: manipulatebitcointraders.ru)
Guys, Bitcoin truly is revolutionary and will change the world for the better no matter what we post here, so why in the FUCK does this sub feel like watching a commercial for The General while waiting to find out if Shawntae is the baby daddy? Where are my grass roots buddies sharing real experiences trading in the real world?
In conclusion: **The mods in this sub are incompetent and should feel bad. The entire sub should be condemned before the payday cash advance signs start cropping up everywhere.**

I don't leech jack shit. I've probably put way more money into this government than you could ever dream. Maybe that's why I'm so disgusted with what I've spent my money on and you're not.

That's Tim Draper. Anyone who's been around here long enough knows he's the guy who bought the Silk Road bitcoins from the FBI at auction.
Come to think of it, he paid like $600 each for 30,000 coins (could be misremembering) but that would presently be worth a couple hundred million now... enough to afford a custom tie, with probably juuust enough left to buy a lambo or two (hundred).

We're still around. Just sometimes piss off the wrong overly sensitive subreddit (*ahem* twox) and get shadowbanned.

The United States federal government is guilty of a lot of crimes I can't, in good faith, contribute to. If they didn't threaten me with force to continue funding their torture program, their illegal wars, etc. I would gladly defund them in any way I could. Sure, they do some good stuff too, but so does the catholic church, and I'm not paying them either.

It's reasonable. I think with Lightning Networks (probably in a combination with some other tweaks to the protocol) we'll have it.

I'm not talking to them. I'm talking to you (collectively).

Oh my gosh! I never thought about that. The government builds roads and power poles?!
Let me ask you something: If we had never built the interstate highway system, and instead sunk that money into microprocessor R&amp;D (like we did privately anyway), how much faster would we have skipped all the bullshit with government contracts, etc. and just had drones and flying cars, thus not needing the fucking roads?

Perspective: That's not ok. $20 for a Bitcoin transaction is never ok, and the price is now $8000 instead of perhaps $25,000 or more because of it. This tech is completely abstract money (a first in history) and should be superior in every way to other currencies, because the design itself is the only limitation, and it can be changed.

It's either worth 0, or a hell of a lot more than X.
(X being every price Bitcoin's seen so far)
It's not worth 0. Most people don't have the patience to watch a new world changing tech grow from a seed, and no tech has shown more financial promise than this one. I think we just watched a whale cash out, which happens periodically.

The older I get, the less I agree with you. Most of the problems they solve are self-inflicted.

Thanks for crackin' my shit up.

I agree with you and think you are a genius/prophet as long as the price continues to fall. Once it starts to increase again, I will disagree with you and think you are a dumb, stupid idiot, and will find a new god.
Fair enough?

Autonomous System Number (ASN)
If you have one, you **are** the most fundamental unit of internet. Each ISP typically gets one. They let ISPs manually advertise and coordinate what traffic flows where. Since the Internet infrastructure is relatively static, ASN broadcasting doesn't require a huge undertaking to change. I used to operate a few routers for a small, but autonomous piece of internet and I would do things like quit broadcasting our AS number on our Time Warner router so traffic would trickle to our AT&amp;T line.
By IT standards, it's a clunky system that happens to work very well at the scale of the internet. I'm sure there's some kind of mesh solution that would work better, but then there's the problem of concensus - getting everyone to switch to the better system. For example: IPv6 came out like 20 years ago and most of the internet is still using IPv4 (35 year old design) just because IPv4 interoperates and can and has been retrofitted to scale to much more than the several billion nodes it was originally designed to handle.
In the mean time, people like you are unconsciously paying people like me to manually assure delivery of your IP packets around the globe :)

I'm mainly looking at the fact that the price is $8000 and the transaction fees are still only $1.50 or so. I could be wrong, but I think that's a lot better than the last go-around.
That said, I still feel like people are getting all worked up and we're going to hit peak-transaction-fee again, which is exactly why we're not trading in the $1 million range right now. :( The transactions-per-second limit is great for censorship resistance, but it's also making Bitcoin fight for universal acceptance with one hand tied behind its back, so to speak.

American males around age 30 sold to buy nice Christmas presents. Trading bots and speculators caused a tumble. Now the American males are re-buying bitcoin, and the trading bots and speculators are piling on trying to get cheap coins. Doesn't take a genius. They are the primary demographic for Bitcoin and they like to buy nice shit this time of year.
