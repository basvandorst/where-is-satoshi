Haha thanks for this man
BTW is anyone trading or is everyone holding
Found this video which made my think about trading so selling and buying back when it drops
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:00:43
Its not FUD man! I am thinking whether to just HODL or risk selling some now and buy back at cheaper price. I am a big believer of bitcoin and its uses so I believe it will go up in the future as explained in the video.

Yes that is possible however, by the time it gets to that stage it might be too late as in the price might be very high. There is risk to investing in bitcoin, however there might be potential reward.
It is in human nature to invest in somethings that is scarce and other people are makin money from it. I suggest people to invest a small ammount they can afford to lose but yes there is risk to it.
This was explained well in this video

Good point man!
That's why I am trading only about a portion of my portfolio and not gambling it all
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:38:30
I am trading about 25% of my bitcoin holdings with tight stop losses and holding the rest. Thanks for your constructive feedback

Another reason for making this video is I am disappointed that people without blockchain knowledge is investing blindly. I think we should educate and promote blockchain technology as its got potential to change the world!

Yeah Iam getting tired as well but I will like to hear both side of the stories. Bitcoin is a risky investment. But as a i believer of blockchain I am going to HODL
What are people's thoughts on trading if you have day trading experience?
This video talk about trading vs HODLING
I wanna get some thoughts on trading and any effective crypto day trader here or not?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:57:18
Yeah I think the same, We will not see huge growth like 1000x but 100x over long term is achievable as blockchain has real uses and is here to stay!
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:55:42
Sorry man I dont know too much about the tulip mania, but point I was making was bitcoin can crash but will bounce back as the blockchain technology is awesome!!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:38:53
Yes that what I am hoping
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:37:37
What are your thoughts on bitcoin as a store of value? In the youtube video he talks about bitcoin as a store of value. It is similar to gold in many ways and blockchain has many uses which there is proof

Guys do you think we should hodl?
Bitcoin has broken various key resistance levels so might even drop to $6000. With all the news coming out from South Korea, China, Tether/Bitfinex and loads more FUD it is likely it may drop.
I am a big believer in BLOCKCHAIN so confident it will go up but not sure about short term price. This video helped me make up my mind but still not sure? Please advise guys as I might sell now and look to buy back at a cheaper price

I agree with you there but I think volatility will be a lot less when the market cap is higher. As there are only few people owning a lot of the market cap it is easy to manipulate the price (WHALES). The volatility will be lot less in the future....
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:58:21
Haha awesome video man.
You missed the end bit. BITCOIN TO THE MOON
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:00:10
Could post man. Thanks
Guys just hodl or if you are an experienced trader try to short a small percentage of your portfolio like the video below but for most people holding is the best option
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:19:45
The reason why I think it might crash back to 4k-5k is because that's where we were last year sept time, before all the institutional/wall street money come in. And also every tom dick and harry started investing think they will be owning a lambo in a month sold as soon as it crashed a little bit as they dont understand crypto markets! Just my thoughts man
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:35:48
stop trolling man
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:09:24
Hey man, Not sure if sales over. Market has bounced back violently today. If you bought when it dropped around $6k, like myself HODL! If you didn't get into it I would wait slightly for the market to stabalise.  It might not drop again and continue the bounce but the risk to reward of getting in now might not be worth it! Do your own analysis, educate yourself and make your own decision

I'll change the language its my video. Hope you found it usefull anyway&gt;
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:31:48
Thanks man! Appreciate it
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:25:17
Well there a lot of people who trade it. THe volatility of crypto allows you to make a lot more money from it than stocks. You catch a 10% rise in one of the coins that might be enough profit for a weeks worth of trading forex. I use to trade forex with leverage but still didnt make enough money as in crypto
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:36
Just Hodl mate.
You cant lose you dont sell.
If you believe in blockchain technology hodl.
And you dont believe in blockchain you shouldn't have invested anyway. Greed is never good bro

Hey, appreciate the feedback. Even if crypto market cap does not hit 10$ trillion market cap, bitcoin and cryptocurrency has huge potential growth in the next couple of years. If people understand more about economics, technology and finance, they won't worry so much about crashes and corrections.  If you enjoyed the video please give a subscribe. I think there might be another correction before a bull run, just my thoughts. Thanks man!
