My node is just fine.

This has already been decided in 2009.  Longest chain, most hashpower.  To change this rule requires consensus.  
You can say with a straight face that there is ACTUALLY consensus on BIP148.  There is not, so good luck running a consensus mechanism under this pretense.  Those that follow will agree, but others will have their own network.  
Considering the alternative (not doing a UASF), this entire thing is INSANE.  NOT DOING UASF IS 1000 times better

Good job Name calling.  At least you are good at something, the more name calling the better . . .

you must be the CENTER of control.  Awesome, love system's with a center exab.  I will do MY job and run a full node that I LIKE, mine an implementation that I WANT, use a network that takes my actions into consideration.  
Have fun suddenly trying to hard fork in just 2 months time a network that for years has been avoiding a fork like this.  I am sure this plan will go swell.

what is the point of the 95% threshold on Segwit if we try to change bitcoin this way, on a subject that is CLEARLY contentious among the community.

Can we not do UASF?  it smells funny.
