Welcome to the club brother!
The sad part?  I've got 30GHash!
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:08:11
Interesting.  I guess I'll start my node back up then.

On other exchanges.  I don't really consider coinbase an exchange.  It's more of a way to buy or sell BTC for USD only.
I don't day trade, but when I was mining LTC, I would use BTC-E to convert it to BTC, since the exchange rate fluctuated - I could at times get .03 BTC for 1 LTC.
There are many others, this is just my example.  The barrier to BTC-E is that you can't just add funds from a checking account or credit card to it.  That is what makes coinbase so easy.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:42:12
Exactly this.

Someone on the BFL forums found [this](  He said he found it here on reddit, but it at least gives a rough estimate as to the order system.  I think you might be onto something with the time theory if you look at the orders.
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:31:26
It's all in this [thread](
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:18:10
My wife doesn't even get a clue how obsessed I am.  I just hope I get that BitForce Jalapeno before I retire so I can prove to her exactly why I bought it.
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:17:25
I'm on the other end of the spectrum.  I've blown all I've got on the Jala's I ordered.  I've got like $20 left on my credit account!  For the meantime I've converted all of my machines to LTC, and I'm not doing that bad.  Since the conversion rate to BTC is so good, I convert (through BTC-E) and sell.  I've estimated that I'm pulling about 1 BTC a month right now.
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:06:12
This is what I've been doing.  Especially given the increased difficulty in mining BTC as of late.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:56:35
Indeed it is just firmware.  BFL Josh has stated this.
@_date: 2013-07-22 15:32:01
whoa, that's just like the bit-card that's sitting on my desk right now.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:16:59
You got it.  The real question though is how long did it take you to come to that conclusion?  I had less than 2 minutes.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:32:53


They are.  Source?  I have an interview with them in 3 hours for this exact thing.
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:29:39
Yep, it's helping me make the payments til I can really mine.  That's the hope anyway....
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:57:43
I ordered 3 Jalapeno's in the spring and got them all by the end of October.  Since then I've mined roughly 1 BTC.
I've almost made enough to pay off the miners.  Lets just hope these stay profitable enough to last a year or so.  I think once I get under .01 a day, I'll start looking at alt-coins.
@_date: 2013-07-12 02:10:07
They had a post a week or so ago, and I thought to myself "what the heck" and bought one.
The only thing I can say at this point is that it's almost impossible to scan, so I'm thankful that they put the full public address on the card.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:45:53
What questions are you referring to?
@_date: 2013-06-17 12:34:27
When I started mining that's what I mined, but I moved onto BTC and was doing fairly well.  Now that it's up to 19 mil, not so much.
@_date: 2013-05-16 10:58:46
Best comment here......I lol'd
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:26:19
Okay, I finally got a decent scanning app on my phone and YES!  I like this a lot.  Once I get my miners in 2 weeks, lol, I might buy several more and load them with some fractional bitcoin to hand out to family.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:35:33
Here is something based on fact.  I placed 2 orders on different dates.
My first order was placed on 3/19/13 and is order # 100023776
My second order was placed on 4/6/13 and is order # 100035149
From what I know the first digit was arbitrarily placed by BFL.  I am very leery that in that amount of time they received 11,373 orders though.  Perhaps the order number is advanced every time a person adds something to their cart?
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:45:44
I changed all of my equipment to LTC months ago when the difficulty reached 19mil.  I then convert it to BTC and sell to pay my bills for my pre-order with BFL.
With the rate they're currently shipping, it actually might just be 2 more weeks at this point.  No joke.
@_date: 2013-06-17 03:08:50
Because of this, I have now switched all of my GPU miners to LTC.  Can't wait for my first order with BFL to arrive!
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:04:52
Bloomington checking in.  I'll have to stop by and exchange some btc for some of your tea!
@_date: 2013-09-16 11:39:45
Exactly.  6 months ago these were indeed money machines.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:35:46
As many have said here, I don't feel like we're getting the entire picture of what's going on down there for a very specific reason.
What it is is pure speculation, but it's definitely starting to make me crack.  I paid for all of my orders with credit, knowing I'd have to wait a while.
I just hope my mining operations hold out long enough to make payments until I get my three orders.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:26:22
TIL: 4 whole internets are only worth $1 USD.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:46:56
Okay, interview over.
Everything went well, until the end anyway.  He threw some logic questions at me that I really wasn't prepared for.  Had I been in a "test" situation, and not comfortably at home - I could have tackled them with ease.
He told me that they are currently in a hiring blitz for support persons.  They were not prepared for the explosion in number of accounts.  He said that they've had 500% more accounts added in November alone.
You can be located anywhere.  He said they have people all over the US, Germany &amp; even the far east.
The logic questions were as follows:
What is the difference in degrees of the minute and hour hands of a clock when the time is 3:15?
You have 7 bars of gold and 1 bar of fools gold.  You have a 2 sided scale to weigh the bars.  How do you find the bar of fools gold while only using the scale twice?
He threw the only 2 times part at me after I gave my first answer, which was to recursively weigh half of the total until you find the fools gold.
I should hear something within a week.  Wish me luck, please :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:52:45
Yes, I saw the headline and thought he "came back" for some new announcement.
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:58:39
I've been pondering a paper wallet for quite some time, and would love to have one of the coins (to have something physical) but they are quite expensive.  This is such a great alternative.  I've purchased 1.  If I ever decide I want/need more I hope you guys are still around.
I say this in the most loving ways (as my wife's family is German). You crazy Germans are at it again! :D

I'm thinking they've changed their strategy as well.  I'll report back anything I can.
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:06:34
Exactly.  I've never been on the site, let alone use their services.
I generally use BTC-E or Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:53:51
Or you could trade that Litecoin for BTC on btc-e, the current rate is 1:0.02.

I've been trying to scan using the block chain app.  I'll try a QR scanner, but I agree with u/shallnotwastetime that the QR is somewhat small &amp; the surface being glossy does not help.
If it helps, I'm using an iPhone 4s.

This is why I don't use Mt. Gox, or store any of my BTC in an online wallet.
Some people just have to learn the hard way.
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:42:35
This is exactly what I do, even have my own mini botnet.

Not sure if a pro at trolling or genuine?
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:55:54
Mine as well.  They've already stated that the 5 GH/s units will be shipped before anything else.  Part of me is happy I ordered 2 of them instead of the more expensive units.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:56:32
I know the joke. haha!
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:40:44
If you've been recommending it to people who aren't very familiar with bitcoin, you haven't done a thing wrong.  I think they're the easiest site for people who don't know much to start with.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:29:09
I apologize for not using a more preferred chart.  I merely saw this and had one of those "aha" moments.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:41:16
After having the interview, I sort of understand why the questions exist.  They want people with programming logic in their heads.  Since their system is new and overloaded - they've ran into problems they didn't anticipate happening.
The other portion of this position is debugging their systems, so you need to understand how X functions and relates to Y that outputs to Z.
It's 1 thing when you take a test like he posted, but for me it's entirely different when you're having a conversation that ends with these questions.
I probably sounded like a complete bafoon, but I reiterated that my primary role is in customer service/support in IT - not bitcoin or programming.
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:56:04
Best thread ever!

Welcome to the club.  I've also got orders from April &amp; May.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:53:32
Nope.  I don't hang out on bitcointalk for various reasons.
I simply applied through their site with my resume/linkedin profile information and a cover letter / email.
Edit:  I didn't see the rest of your comment originally.
I find this interesting as well.  I enjoy the "support" side of IT, and it's where I feel I belong.  I don't understand why they would want their support people to know the answers to those questions either.  After seeing that, I'm a bit shocked that they want to interview me.
I guess I will see how it goes.  I love tech, and enjoy programming, but I am no crypto wiz and was never good at math.  I use a calculator on the simplest problems just to make sure the answer is correct.
