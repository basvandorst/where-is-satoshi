Lol, relax, the mediator is a trusted third party, someone i've worked with and known for a while. thats not even close to a concern.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:40:35
who do you think is right here. just getting 10 opinions to show a fair sample instead of berating me seems much more productive.

@_date: 2014-04-25 22:41:47
so your saying the price should be
.28(32 * 482.7) + .28 ( 6 * 449)

Because a mediator holds bids, its the fairest way to do it for ultimate transparency.

Its not entirely just a business question, because it's dealing with the volatility of cryptos.
edit: i apologize if you feel this is the wrong spot to post this, but i think the bitcoin community is way smarter/reliable for both of us in determining a fair judgement on volatility
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:49:02
Yeah, i get it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:36:55
We have different interpretations, posting from a throwaway and objectively is the fairest way to do it.

If i decided to stop bidding he would get .28 * 32 bitcoins (roughly 9) or equivalent value, because he effectively has bought those bitcoins from me and im acting as a "holder" etc. this thread is getting a little derailed from our question, which has been answered by a few users,  the business practices are fine, - like i said, i'm well aware and have a good business mind, ( where his mind is more system-operational based) i posted this because its easier to have third parties confirm what i was saying as opposed to it being my word against his, we have it in our contract that any disagreements / disputes will be solved by third party community for relatively small issues and an external arbitrator for bigger issues.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:45:06
we're not disagreeing, we're being fair. we have different interpretations, therefore we post here. we both agreed that whatever the community decides should be right.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:58:13
this is a unique business.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:02:09
The answer was clear to me too. Again i reiterate, when two people are financially motivated for two different rulings/results, its fairer to have arbitration / others decide it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:53:24
Of course -- It's actually for this reason that it doesnt complicate things if the price goes up, Seems we have a consensus so i'll say that my side was the same as everyone here's, he only owed .28 of 6 more bitcoins, and the other price was locked in, or else i would be effectively getting "freerolled"
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:08:57
lol you seem a little ignorant and closeminded.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:35:50
I think you're slightly mistaken, we can calculate, we're disputing whether the fact that the bitcoin price taking a hit means the price should fully be altered when adding 6 bitcoins, or only those 6 bitcoins should be added. I'm not super experienced in crypto currency (which is what the buying price is in) but can run a business just fine, 
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:48:36
Thats what we're asking yes.
