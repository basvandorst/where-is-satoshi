They've had many bank accounts closed, and they've never been open about the way they handle their money. EG: they used all the pre-order money on buying things in small batches from ebay, instead of buying all the supplies ahead of time. Thus making them have to order more and higher rates. There was a point where they almost went bankrupt since they were spending so much money on the machines.

Not many employees know any bitcoin adresses associated with the company.

NDAs are a bitch. They watch the reddit constantly. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:28:50
At least you don't run any bitcoin mining business.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:31:08
Thanks. Does one have to set up the p2p pool themselves?
@_date: 2014-01-31 06:16:38
My only issue that they don't explicitly state if they do merged mining or not.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:06:28
I'll switch my miners if someone can tell me if it supports merged mining. I'm only mining on pools with merged mining at the current time.
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:05:53
Used to be an employee. I'll take a look and see if I kept their last check. I don't think I did, though. I did recieve direct deposits, though. 
Came in through "DIRDEP 13633 BF LABS IN" with an ID afterwards which I assume is the employee number.

Can you give us a banana for scale?
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:12:00
As someone who used to work with BFL: They are probably mining with the equipment. And They are probably out of some part for the PCB's. Chances are they didn't have any in stock and oversold the units that were performing slowly from the ones that were supposed to be 60GH/s.
Unprofessional company is unprofessional.
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:33:50
Some of the other videos are translated. Great series.
@_date: 2014-01-23 07:09:12
When you work for a small company like BFL, and you hear anything, they know who knows what. They have employees who do nothing but come on reddit and make sure that no one is an exemployee to talk about it.
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:14:18
They pay their employees through direct bank deposit or checks/cash if the employee is illegal.
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:32:34
Sign a NDA against your will for a shit company that would not even sniff at persecuting a previous employee. Yeah. Right.  I can't post more. Sorry.

Again.. People like using a fear-making reasoning method to make  people switch. Why not have a better pool that can legitimately compete?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:31:48
Yes. BFL is, without any doubt, a scam. 
Almost  a year later, and no shipped products. Quickly! Sell your bitcoin, also! Bitcoin is a scam! Hurry before it is too late and you are left with nothing! SQUIRREL!
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:00:09
Okay... I'm just wondering about having it pick-pocketed, or the house broken in, or something. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:32:38
I'm using BFGMiner I believe. Hosted remotely by BFL until the new rig is ready. 
Stratum is awesome, by the way.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:20:47
No one here takes bitcoin seriously. All we are trying to do is lul people into a false sense of security so that their money raises how much we can get for our bitcoins. (Many of us are early adopters with over 1000 BTC)
I am just giving a warning to everyone that bitcoin is a scam.. PPC and SolidCoin 4 Lyfe

Minirig owners were promised a first batch, with a full refund for the FPGA-- JUST so they could lock in their order, and money.
Absolute scumbag.

How vulnerable is it to hardware level hacking?
There are a lot of guides on TOR, but yeah.. You might want to try and figure out how you can make it tamper-proofed.

I've tried many times. They haven't been forthcoming. At all.

It was because of some guy going to the German authority and complaining. The German authority froze his bank account, thinking the service was being used to steal money from customers.
One little prick can be such a pain. May take up to 2 years to get this shit straightened out. If anyone presses charges, it will take even longer, because it adds fuel to the German Police. 
In short: "OMG Bitcoin24 IS TAKING A BIT LONGER THAN USUAL, I SHALL COMPLAIN, AND INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING ABOUT DDoS ATTACKS I AM GOING TO THE POLICE TO SAY HE IS SCAMMING ME SO I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK"
And thus the account is frozen.

Well, it looks like there are some people getting a return with this scam.
I don't even get how it is supposed to work, though.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:24:54
Bitcoin is supposed to be free markets and such: Even if it is a bad idea, they have a large control due to the fact they offer the best service.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:40:04
BitPay is a scam. They are getting ready to run off with all the money.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:19:42
If you JUST ordered one, I'd say refund. 
It'll be 4 or so months before you get anything. IF BFL EVER ships. In that time you can get an Avalon, one of those fancy ASICMiner flash drive things, or whatever new gadget comes along.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:09:55
You're missing my point: instead of trying to make people go to inferior pools, make one that can actually compete. This is the point I'm trying to get across right now. I understand the risk of having a large pool, but I can't find anything that will net me as large of a profit margin as BTC-Guild does.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:16:42
Damn. Does no one read or look into the protocol?
The WALLETS don't support it.
Bitcoin does support it.
The bitcoin protocol has a built in feature for micro payment channels. All it takes is a good developer to implement it.

Some of us weren't expecting all the crap that Mt. Gox  pulled. Seemed like they were trying to make this as chaotic as possible... I've listened to this song over 10 times now... Yeah.. As I said above: Perfect.

Oh yay. Going after the money launderers... 
I am just going to point out:
Why on earth would ANYONE want to launder money when your financial structure is something like Cyprus, where the government/banks can take your money at any time they want.
I just don't understand why these terrible people are hiding their money from the government. It just doesn't make sense D:
But seriously. People need to realize why money laundering is a thing.. Something like the illegal practice of income tax, and such might also account for this huge "issue".
Cheezus. People need to stop being sheep. I haven't even heard of any stories about a silk road drug dealer killing anyone or anything fun like that... Kinda removes some of the risque from the drug dealing scene...
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:58:59
BTC Guild is optimized more than other pools. Not only that, they have a very good implementation of Stratum.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:37:51
I hate to bring it up:
So does that mean gambling sites are a scam? They receive more than they send out

Honestly, though. 30 bucks a month for electricity isn't much compared to 5BTC a day generated.

[Josh's update]( makes it seem like this is true. Not only that, but I believe the chatbox for BFL has had a few people, even BFL_StevenM talking about the same thing. I haven't had anyone confirm, but it has been hinted in other conversations.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:03:37
Yes yes yes. It has been shoved down my throat, but I'm looking at it as: What is best pool right now? BTC Guild.  Has BTC Guild ever abused power? No. Anything fishy? No. Anything as good? No.
All I'm trying to point out is that there isn't anything that is as good of an alternative... Probly why they keep getting close to 51%
If there were better pools, there would be better distribution. However, there is really only one good pool from what I have found, and so I'm sticking with the biggest guy.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:21:25
My miner is fastest on their pool. Simple.
I get 25GH/s MINIMUM on BTCGuild vs 21-23 on every other pool.

I've been looking around. According to the taint information, the first relay for the addresses in question seem to be:
Unfortunately I know nothing else. 
Joric is the maintainer of the website as far as I can tell. Try contacting him or raising concerns on bitcointalk.org. May be your best shot. I don't believe he posts on Reddit, so he would not know of what is going on.

It is amazing, though that when you try to take your payments and such for services as a trade of other goods and services, you can be nailed with "tax evasion", which I can vouch for. Such bullshit.
