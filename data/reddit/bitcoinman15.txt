I agree with your sentiments - but china does the most volume - and if you are referring to coinbase - it is not an exchange -

NY State goes too far. Miners will have to register. Everyone who sells and buys bitcoin could be deemed a business. The only good news is this is not law ..it is a request for comments. I have no idea if they will listen. But basically the law allows the government to monitor everything

Please reminder if coin base wants they can see where the wallet spent the coins, how many coins , and when..the block chain keeps the records.

The only thing that is productive you can do is leave them. They are impossible to deal with.

The article makes a good point. The huge price swings mean that the companies don't want to hold onto Bitcoin. Investors have a longer term perspective. But I think the author is mistaken to think that just because companies are converting to dollars means that bitcoins are not becoming more popular. They are, that's why the companies offer to accept them.

The cheering is a mistake. Coinbase is not just following regulatory guidelines but is going way beyond what is required . No other party that sells bitcoin traces where the coins go or where they come from . Coinbase is as invasive as any bank is and worse since it follows where coins come from and where they go to .

Coinbase claims they are only following the law . It is a fact that despite its claims coinbase itself is not liscenced in the state of new york or california - they are acting in keeping with those laws  they want to and are in violation in the state of new york and the state of california. They are just law breakers when convient and law abiding when convient . I hate coinbase

Coinbase hate is based on how duplicitious they are . They claim ( incorrectly) they hsve to follow where customers spend coins ( no othet money transmitter believes this)  and claims they are only being compliant with laws . The exchange is not properly liscensed in New York and California.The state regulators said they were not . They are knowing breaking law in New York and California because it is good for bussiness . They should not follow where customers spend money and claim they are required to at the sametime as they ignore New York and California regulators.

Coinbase is duplicitous. They are not licensed to be an exchange in New York and California. They don't care. They still offer that service. Why do you think the regulators allow them to  . My guess is because they are giving up all the private information they are asking from people like yourself. They are not law abiding . They are making a pact with the devil. "Let us operate in violation of your state laws and we will give you all this data about our customers" is the deal I suspect they made.
