I don’t believe there is a spread. When you buy on Coinbase (regular not pro) there is a spread and you are always paying higher than market price plus fees. As far as I can tell on cash app...if the price is at $8000 and you press buy the exchange rate will be $8000.

Care to elaborate? Am I being naive when I see the current price at $8500 and the exchange rate also at $8500?

I don’t ever see Cash app as a recommended exchange for bitcoin in these threads. Is there any particular reason people don’t use it, or that it’s not anyone’s RECOMMENDED platform?

Yeah I don’t want to get too technical but it’s largely because it’s Spooky Month and then Mashed Potatoes Month.

Even accounting for the fees taken out to put your total at $100, the market to exchange markup is still considerably higher. And the fees, $2.99 on Coinbase to $1.25 on cash app.

A recent purchase wasn’t covered by your bank, login on desktop to add funds to cover or they’ll sell your crypto within 5 days or something to get their money.

There’s an option to withdraw bitcoin where it asks you to enter a receiving wallet address.

Less than $1.25 for $100 buy, $12.50 for $1,000
