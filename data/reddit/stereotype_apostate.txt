It kills me how many of my countrymen want to ignore a system that works in dozens of developed countries in favor of some mythical "free market" solution that works no where, including here where we tried it for decades already.
Just because it fits their stupid ideology.

Nope you hit it on the head. I keep hoping something will change at the ballot box but it doesn't. At this point I don't think things will get better until there are bodies in the streets.

Taking taxes is violence, which is wrong. Letting millions suffer and die, or forcing them into financial destitution due to health issues which are mostly out of their control, is not violence, so it's okay, right?
See? Stupid ideology. And dangerous.

I don't care if they know *my* porn habits, but I'd be worried if they know my representative's porn habits. I'd be worried if they knew the porn habits of civil rights leaders, or major businessmen, or other public persons.

Yeah I doubt Venezuela will be the ones to bring down the petrodollar as long as the Saudis sell their sweet crude for USD.

Gotta admit I'm jelly. When I first heard about them they were 200ish a coin, but I  was in high school and I couldn't afford that at all. Right now I'm in college and that's still too rich for my blood. But God damn it if I had a little money back then.
