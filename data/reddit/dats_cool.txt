Because its deflationary aspect isn't intrinsic.. you know that right? It'll always be deflationary until its purchasing power/market cap reaches a state of equilibrium, where then it'd be more viable as a currency for global commerce. Regardless, the underlying technology has tons of applications aside from being used as a store of value or for value transactions. Even so, the entire darknet ecosystem completely relies on crypto-currencies and deflation hasn't slowed it down at all. Why would it in mainstream society? Again, it'll be deflationary until a point.

No Bitcoin is backed by blockchain technology and has a developmental road-map that, if achieved, will make BTC a viable tool for commerce. Its intrinsic value is its unique technology and its potential to revolutionize commerce. There are thousands of companies built in the crypto-space, thousands of exchanges, and wall street is now adopting BTC in futures contracts. It has a thriving ecosystem that isn't just advertisement and memes.. lmao. Theres hardly even any advertisement vested into BTC, it has first-movers advantage and the product advertises itself. This isn't bitcoin cash.

2013 isn't 2017. the market is literally 100x bigger. if BTC goes down 80% it'll wipe out the entire crypto market and all the companies and investors that are vested into it. exchanges will lose billions over night and have to shut down. if the crypto market collapses again at this magnitude then it'll be an extremely long time until we see a resurgence. 
there are literally hundreds if not thousands of companies all built on the crypto space, there are literally hundreds of exchanges just dedicated to trading crypto internationally. if BTC collapses 80% it'll take down all the alts with it as well. investors would lose 100s of billions collectively. 
a crash of that magnitude is extremely unlucky, and if it does happen, you can say goodbye to the crypto space for the next 5-10 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:02:06
and thats why futures CME just opened up last week, and another futures market opened a week before that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:04:44
right, but the difference is that there were only a handful of exchanges a market cap of some &lt;10B and maybe 10s of businesses that existed. a market crash back then wasn't that dramatic. i think &lt;5 coins existed with BTC/LTC owning 99% market share. there wasn't mainstream adoption back then either, we have futures market, tons of media attention, mass international adoption with banks and traditional "old money" heavily invested. the market back then was not insulated at all from a mass market correction. besides, the collapse of MTGOX was what set off the crash. over $500M was wiped out with it that investors never got back. 
there needs to be a cataclysmic event for the market crash to happen again at that magnitude. its much more mature and insulated. i doubt a crash like that would happen anytime soon, the probability is low.

@_date: 2018-05-14 20:19:00
100% certainly isn't "comfortable" and 120% is when it starts becoming problematic, in my eyes. at some point, interest payments will eat up more and more of the budget, right now its 10%. the higher the % gets the more we would have to budget JUST TO PAY INTEREST. there will be societal effects if we keep kicking the can down the road, but in general i think 120% is where you start to really touch the upper-limit of whats fiscally responsible. on the other hand Japan is about 240% and is doing reasonable economically.

wow the level of ignorance in this thread is laughable. YOU dont get it. do you understand how hyper inflation works? obviously not. hyper inflation happens when the government prints an insane amount of money and expands the money supply without organic economic growth. everyones money is worth less and less each time the supply is expanded. governments print money to try and fix their monetary issues and pay off debts without actually having organic revenue and economic growth, this leads to hyperinflation. you cant have hyperinflation with bitcoin because its supply is fixed and cryptographically enforced. no one can manipulate the supply. if a government were to ever use bitcoin as a reverse currency then it'd be absolutely impossible to cause hyperinflation. what can happen is that the government goes bankrupt because of fiscal irresponsibility. 
poor investments dont cause hyperinflation, artificially increasing the money supply without economic justification causes hyperinflation. you cant manipulate the supply of bitcoin thus you cant cause hyperinflation.

@_date: 2018-05-14 20:37:13
ah, the way i see it is is that wages are extremely stagnant and have not risen for 2 decades. theres a massive aging population that cant work. therefore its extremely risky for the government to increase inflation rates in order to spur investments and growth. inflation is generally good and favorable in most cases, but only when the population can take a hit in declining purchasing power and a rise in products/services. also wages have to rise as well. thats what i understand about it at least. deflationary societies are interesting. their purchasing power slowly increases as products/services fall in price but its bad for the broader economy as its much more difficult for companies to take out loans in order to invest as the government cant really just print out money out of thin air.

oh shut up the protocol makes it decentralized, just because theres zero regulation and market makers doesn't mean its not decentralized. and no the higher the price the more volatility is NOT true at all. in fact its the complete opposite as the higher the price the higher the market cap, meaning more money is needed to move the price. higher market cap also means more liquidity which makes it more difficult to manipulate the price.

...no? why would the amount of national debt vs working conditions be a correlation? the government is just deficit spending, i.e. spending more than it takes in. eventually it catches up to you. 240% national debt is absurd though, eventually at some point countries will stop loaning out to Japan because its deemed too much of a risk. as long as they can keep paying the interest on the loans then its stable economically. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:48:06
thats a fucking stupid comparison and you know it. ones a heavily regulated currency issued by a one of the biggest economies on the planet and another one is heavily speculated and completely decentralized. lack of mass adoption and heavy speculation is what makes BTC volatile, vs. a completely incompetent government that is destroying the livelihood of its people. one is fixable, the other is not. BTC needs more time and adoption, you can't just fix corruption and incompetence. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:43:09
so fucking what? thats how any asset works. by your logic gold is a socialist scheme to get everyone rich that buys into it. thats absolutely absurd. no one is fucking saying everyone that owns BTC is going to get wealthy. just because people are speculating on its future worth, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ASSET, doesnt mean its whats going to happen. in fact, the mantra is quite the opposite. everyone always states that BTC is extremely volatile and risky, even thought leaders in this space. everyone touts fiscal responsibility and to never invest more than you can afford to lose.

you need BTC as collateral to do LN transactions. you can't move BTC on LN that you don't have. how could credit work under such a system? credit is essentially IOUs without being backed by anything. LN payments are IOUs that are backed by actual BTC. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:14:08
thats actually a really interesting premise. would be very hard to implement and would essentially require you to completely divulge your identity since they'd need to have a way to penalize you for missing payments or defaulting on your debts. with your identity they could penalize your credit score, and other such ramifications.
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:32:53
no dude, you do know how LN works right? you have to put up the BTC in a multi-sig address on chain before you can spend it on LN. you can only spend the amount of BTC that you put up as collateral and nothing more. you can't spend any more BTC than you have. credit doesn't work like that. you can spend money you don't have.

interesting, cool article thanks for sharing. i have a weird fascination with Satoshi and what kind of person he was. im 100% convinced it was 1 person, since he was always outsourcing work to other devs in the community. if he was a team they wouldn't be asking randoms on forums for dev help. furthermore, im assuming he was just a prodigal developer that probably worked a full-time/part-time job and worked on bitcoin on the side. he clearly had the dev skills capacity to fix whatever issues he had with development but needed to outsource constantly, because of time crunches from his work responsibilities. he was 100% a libertarian and seemed full of hope and lots of innovative energy. his word usage and grammar and reference to a british newspaper/headline in the genesis block, plus his wake/sleep patterns as evidenced by his frequency and timing of his bitcointalk forum posts, indicates that he was british. 
my guess is that Satoshi was in his early to mid 30s, he seemed like a seasoned developer and it was evident that he had over a decade or more in professional development experience. not only that, but he had lots of proficiency in a wide array of fields like cryptography, political theory, economic/game theory, discrete math, and other exotic fields of computer science. this suggests to me he has a PhD level academic background in some field relating to computer science, or hes been a professional developer for at least a decade.
so, i believe Satoshi is someone that we don't know of. He's not anyone that people have been suggesting, he's a completely anonymous person that we have no way of knowing who he is, and likely will never find out. He was in his early to mid 30s when he was developing bitcoin and he was British (or lived in the UK for an extended period of time). i assume he was in 30s because of his libertarian and alternative political viewpoints, which usually is skewed towards people in their mid 20s to early 30s. he also had that innovative, hopeful, energy that is usually found in youthful prodigies. so everything sort of points to him being in that sweet spot of early to mid 30s.

@_date: 2019-12-17 18:49:42
It doesn't work like that. The fed printed trillions since the last recession and inflation is at a very modest 2% which is vital to a healthy economy. 2% inflation is ideal. Increasing liquidity and the money supply isn't a bad thing when it's done right. 500b is a drop in the bucket relative to the global economy it will have 0 effect on you.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:27:23
thats not how it would work, they cant just buy up all the BTC at market prices. the price would rise dramatically as supply thins and sell pressure declines. put in a multi-billion dollar buy order on the open market, and BTC would roar from 8.3k to 50k+ in hours. if they were to keep buying BTC would keep rising dramatically until you get 6-figure BTC. which, shit, by them cornering the market us crypto investors win in the end anyway. you could eat up the entire GDAX order book from 8k to 16k with only a couple hundred million dollars.

fees only start getting big when blocks are full. so bigger blocks right now wouldn't do a damn thing. however, bigger blocks are ideal as BTC will inevitably experience full blocks like we did in Q4 2017 again and fees will start getting absurd. however, segwit, batching, and lightning will work against blocks becoming full. its complicated.
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:29:11
no just because there isn't enough demand for blocks to be full. fees only go up significantly when blocks are full. only reason fees were so high back then because blocks were full because of massive demand. if we had 1.5MB blocks then fees would have been a lot lower back then. but right now we're only utilizing about 800kb of block space, so anything more than that won't lower fees.

nah you're being extremely naive. this sort of stuff absolutely affects the market. the market is literally mostly driven by emotion and sentiment. look at this thread for example, 
someone else posted something about mtgox movement. look at how some of the posters are responding. they literally have no idea what this means and the first thing theyre assuming is that a massive dump is going to happen. what do you think theyre going to do? most likely sell. this happens on a macro scale and feeds on itself. 
even if they did sell, they confirmed its done OTC and not even on the open market. see? even you have misconceptions of whats going on. 
this is 100% fearmongering when it reality nothing is happening. it doesnt matter though, because now its driving a perception that something IS going to happen. thats the only thing that matters. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:21:15
okay cool dude, but when you say 150M worth of BTC has been moved from mtgox people are assuming you mean hes selling them. nothings been sold yet. but ofc people will panic sell because theyre morons. making threads like this is just asking for BTC to dump. why does it matter if he moved coins from one wallet to another? if he sold them, which you can tell from the blockexplorer, then yeah that would be a massive concern. they already confirmed they dont have permission to sell anything from judges until further notice, at the very least summer. 
this whole bullshit is non-news but everyone is going to panic because theyre sheep and stupid.
and yes, spreading information DOES cause the market to dump. especially when its easily misinterpreted shit like this. the first thing people are going to assume when they see threads like this is that a massive whale is going to market sell a fuck load of coins, not "oh gee i wonder where he moved those coins to". like come on dude.

@_date: 2018-04-27 17:51:42
uhh no, 50 BTC per block was the highest and no one individually was earning that much anyway since the vast majority of people were in pools and had to split the rewards. even back then with a decent graphics card, people were only mining maybe a couple BTC or so a day at the most. most people didn't bother since the electricity costs weren't worth the BTC that was mined.  
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:09:19
seriously? i never said that market selling 16k BTC is even possible or what happens in reality. i'm saying that other think like that, and thats the most important part. i mean ffs, OP even said a few posts above that implied that the trustee is going to market sell 16k BTC, thats where i even got that from. 
and regardless, how the hell would you even know? im sure exchanges will work with wealthy individuals to sell off their holdings over time on the open market if they needed to, so technically it is possible. if theres enough of financial incentive, exchanges will definitely work with people to sell off mass holdings.

goddamn you fucking legend, anti-bitcoiners are the most insufferable people on this planet. props to you man, hope life is great.

lol okay buddy, thats a cute way of having not to argue because you know you cant. "yeah well you just dont know what youre talking about", thats literally your response.
all you have to do is just explain how this situation would be profitable with 8-figures in capital with a reasonable amount of risk. its just a really dumb argument.
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:23:57


oh sure you do buddy, lmfao.

lol dude you need to educate yourself

but jesus man i dont understand how this happens. i literally triple check everything before i send out any funds and i never send out the full amount in the beginning. always a few dollars first to see if everythings good to go.

wow so le edgy
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:02:43
well technically BTC will always be there regardless if there any miners in the network or if the entire internet infrastructure went out. its always going to be there on the blockchain. once the infrastructure is rebuilt you could always reaccess your BTC. pretty amazing.

first of all CME trades are futures contracts, second of all shorting isn't the act of just market selling so i dont know what you're talking about when you say dump them as "CME shorts". that literally makes no sense.
second of all buying up 16k BTC then dumping them on the open market would be insanely unprofitable. to buy up those 16k BTC you would have to pay market value for every single coin (assuming youre doing it OTC), if you dump 150M USD worth of BTC on the market you're going to run into massive slippage. so you effectively pay 150M for BTC, sell them off for ~100M because of slippage. you'd have to open up some massive shorts in order to cover those losses, not even that but its also massively risky to open shorts preemptively on that dump because the market might rebound extremely quick and then your profit margin would be tiny on the short, or maybe you'd even lose money because the market rebounded too quickly. 
shorting means to take out a loan of a commodity or asset, sell it at current prices, then buy it back at a lower price and give it back to the original loaner. you pocket the difference as your profit. when you short you also have to pay a loan fee, so you'd have to pay money for borrowing that asset.
finally, this is massively illegal to do regardless if its crypto. CME is massively regulated, and if youre manipulating CME markets, even if its bitcoin, you're committing a felony and would get into massive trouble.
not even that, but the coins moved out of the GOX wallet are still there. they haven't been moved to an exchange or anything. nothings been sold.
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:05:49
selling OTC and dumping 16k BTC on market orders are two vastly different scenarios. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:06:10
only a few coins? thats a few hundred dollars man
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:05:30
i hate people like you. youre the idiots that dump the market after baseless FUD
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:38:21
lol okay, and what happened when India announced that BTC was illegal as currency, South Korean exchange raids, Bitfinex Subpoena, China Ban, G20 Summit meeting, first time MTGOX was reported to have mass sold, etc.
I was just giving binance as an example, the point is that news, whether or not its actually negative, causes a negative perception in the market, people start selling off. margin traders are usually the first to start which then trickles down. 
i have no idea how this news will play out, prices seem to be okay for now but sentiment changes so goddamn quick i would not be in the least bit shocked if the market dropped like a rock today.
and dude you're completely assuming things in this scenario in order to support your own argument, and you're saying that i'm focusing on certain aspects in order to strengthen my argument which somehow means i have a confirmation bias? you're doing the exact same thing.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:57:31
thats literally the dumbest shit ive ever heard and its sad that youre getting upvotes. do you even know shorting works? because thats not how it works.

roughly 1-2% of gold's value comes from practical applications. its an extremely speculative asset even though it has retained its value extremely well over the years.

would only take a handful of miners to start validating the network again as difficulty will pretty much plummet to 0 again so it'd be extremely easy to ramp-up the network again. you wouldn't even need a powerful computer to do it, could do it on a shitty raspberry pi since difficulty would be near 0.
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:41:41
alright congrats man, give yourself a nice pat on the back.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:46:07
i bought BTC with PNC back in december.. so this must be extremely recent. i also bought a sizeable amount so.. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:32:41
jesus christ if you dont know what shorts being liquidated means or what it means in this specific context then you have no right to speculate on bitcoin's future value.
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:31:04
its not an exchange wallet ffs..
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:07:39
lol okay buddy, im sure the 20 bucks youve made on that trade really adds up. dont go spending it all at once.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:51:01
youre retarded
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:04:26
the thing is that people dont understand the implications of this news and they assume the absolute worst. when it reality, nothing has been sold. they dont have permission to sell until they are granted approval from judges and they already confirmed they cant sell until the summer at the very least. if they do sell, they sell OTC in order to not affect market prices.
of course most idiots will think that 16k BTC is about to get market sold, so it is FUD when the information doesn't reflect the reality. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:44:58
nice man, equivalent to covering your ears and saying "lalalala" when you don't like what you hear or can't say anything back.

goddamn this kinda shit is gonna cause the market to dump, it wasnt moved to an exchange.. fuck, well hope you guys like losing money cuz this puppy is gonna drop. you can thank everyone thats sharing this on reddit channels. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:27:57
i meant the variation margin. the difference in price gets evaluated everyday which then affects how much the contract is ultimately settled for. that was a mistake. monthly settlement just makes this whole scenario even more risky and not worth the effort. 
lol you're literally talking out of your ass and you can't even argue your statements. you literally just reply with 2 sentences of non-substance.  
right buddy, i totally don't know what i'm talking about. your arguments suck and you literally can't even explain remotely how this situation would work and how it would be profitable to someone with 8-figures worth of capital.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:22:40
you had plenty of chances to get it at ~6500. its not going to 5800. its way more likely we're in a genuine reversal. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:52:10
theyre not selling goddamn it, they consolidated it to a single wallet.. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:04:48
fungibility is overrated imo. the only scenario in which the community would do a blacklist consensus on a particular individual or organization is one that is dangerous to the network or has done something extremely heinous. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:53:59
i hate people honestly with their conspiracy bullshit. theyre not selling those coins off in the market. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:12:07
youre probably the stupid fuck that sells at any hint of turbulence and then FOMOs back in went the price pumps. typical buy high sell low.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:06:38


i never even said that couldn't happen, i'm just saying the risk is ridiculous and you'd have to make enough profit in order to mitigate the losses you've made from slippage. i'm saying the whole situation is unrealistic.


i've most likely have been here much longer than you. yeah bro everyone just fucking skirts the law and risks their livelihood and freedom because in le crypto land everything is legal and banksters are all tyrants and corrupt. no dude, most people are normal and follow the law. everyone thinks everything is a fucking conspiracy. its a lot to risk to blatantly manipulate CME markets, especially when you're dealing with futures contracts that are settled at the end of each trading day. yeah lets open up shorts right before the trading day is over, a shitload of BTC is dumped on the open market and you just happen to open up a massive short at the right time. that wouldn't be obvious right? any idiot could put 2 and 2 together. if youre buying OTC then your identity is compromised too so if some gov agency wanted to investigate they could easily see who did what. 


and you do? you're making a way bigger assumption than I am. the coins haven't moved anywhere. they're just sitting there. maybe they wanted to consolidate coins into a single wallet. its confirmed they arent allowed to sell off anymore coins until they get confirmation from a judge that the trustee is allowed to, the earliest that can happen is sometime later this summer. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:23:22

how are you even making that assumption..

@_date: 2018-04-26 10:01:59
yeah and what are these guys that are trading on margin going to be looking for? market indicators that skew bullish or bearish. if they think people will freak out over gox movement then they'll open shorts on margin. its not just the people freaking out who'll affect the market, its people's perception of whether or not people will freak out. 
intelligent traders wont freak out, but theyll trade on the fact that they assume other people will freak out which will cause downward pressure. margin traders intensify movement and sentiment. 
and its not just reddit traders tethering up lmfao, its news outlets picking up on threads like this and spreading fear to the greater market. it has massive effects. remember back when we had that binance hack that literally wasn't even that big of a deal and as soon as the info leaked BTC dumped 1000 dollars in minutes? yeah, well i wouldn't be surprised if we had a massive dump like that today during the afternoon when the news starts spreading. i bet by noon the  thread on will be some karma whore making a thread about the gox movement.
