I checked it out, it was about their 1.5 millionth roll
plugging in the values on this calculator:
The odds are 0.72% or 1 in 138 based on a set of 1.5 million rolls with 27 losses in a row

I am still going too, tried over 12 million Unicode combinations

Are there any libraries that do this? or do all the products (not c# specific) out there have their own sha256 implementation?
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:07:50
edit: I was going down the wrong path that sha256 was the slow component, its calculating the public key that is slow
I think the EC_POINTs_mul function in openssl must be where you can calculate them in chunks?

I have challenged Just-Dice too, his answer is to just write down every bet you ever make and verify at the end:

You are jumping to conclusions a bit quickly, I meant it was the gamblers 1.5m roll not the sites

So your happy to hard fork the pow at the drop of a hat but you won't increase the 1mb cap for the last two years?

Sorry, this will be more useful

I think there is unicode or it would have been won now, also check this thread:   
  
Is it possible to scrypt using the gpu like cgMiner?, then you would be flying and might actually get the unicode password.

I just posted in the other thread, but here is my solution before the hint:  
  
I have tried about 80k combinations since last night without success.  
Here is how I did it: (note it was put together in 10 minutes)  
1. Download the c# project by Mike Caldwell (Casascius)
  
2. Open the solution with visual studio  
3. Open the Form1 designer  
4. Create a button and double click it so you can put the code in  
5. My example code: (change it up if you like)  
    object interpretation = StringInterpreter.Interpret("6PfYU8C5sLGsjDNWsCHRYD6G5noFmc184Q4owtnfvXrUdpsfNkeTq2HDV8", compressed: compressToolStripMenuItem.Checked, addressType: this.AddressTypeByte);  
    KeyPair kp = null;  
    PassphraseKeyPair ppkp = (PassphraseKeyPair)interpretation;  
    int count = 0;  
    var random = new Random();  
            var chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFHGIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890".ToArray();  
    string pw;  
    do {  
        pw = Enumerable.Range(0, 3).Aggregate(new StringBuilder(), (sb, n) =&gt; sb.Append((chars[random.Next(chars.Length)])), sb =&gt; sb.ToString());  
        txtPrivHex.Text = (count++).ToString() + " " + pw;  
        Application.DoEvents();  
    } while (ppkp.DecryptWithPassphrase(pw)==false);  
    kp = ppkp.GetUnencryptedPrivateKey();  
    txtPubHex.Text = kp.PrivateKeyHex;  
    MessageBox.Show(pw + " " + kp.PrivateKeyHex);  
6. Compile and Run the app  
7. To get to the form you create an address, right click the address details  
8. Click your button and wait
* It is not trying in an order, so it may do the same password more than once.  
* I used that form because it had textboxes and code already.  
* It is not multithreaded, but you can run the program twice and let windows handle that for you.
* Change up the list of characters you want it to pick from.

 Will do that for you

Its gone, so what was the password in the end? I must have tried over a million combinations and failed :)

I think it is mono compatible, so install mono and it should run on Linux
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:35:22
What do you mean? because OP says it has unicode?

You likely have already spent this money (with 0 fee so it hasn't been included in a block), then when you imported it into blockchain it asked if you wanted to "sweep" the btc, which puts out a new transaction (the double spend) to transfer it into another blockchain address, not sure why it says 2 Confirmations
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:16:43
it has been 72 hours, post the password so we can verify
