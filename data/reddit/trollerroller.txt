Well, past 2 weeks averaging around 11K flat...
Told you.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:18:15
where did you get that number of 100 full time devs? bitcoin core doesnt even have official full time devs, and only 17 maintainers/contributors are listed online 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:02:38
Does anyone even know what symbol the futures will trade under?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:49:58
only if you left it in the NiceHash wallet ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:09:43
you still need an exchange to actually BUY coins though... -_-
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:07:48
except that's not enough above the minimum transaction fee

yeah, short term this is maybe “gambling” but long term BTC is going up
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:45:36
yeah, this is nothing new... if you have something that has USD value, physical gold, for example, you have to declare any buying and selling of it on your taxes / FAFSA, etc. this is just a bunch of reddit whiners who don't understand a GODDAMN thing... they really think that bitcoin is a separate asset and above the law... no dude, it's just like anything else, and uncle sam always gets his cut.
the IRS is going to have a field day once they start investigating all the americans who haven't kept track of their bitcoin transactions

LITECOIN IS A COPY OF BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:02:23
why is 17K a psychological barrier? just because we havent hit it what, 2 weeks?

@_date: 2017-12-03 13:08:23
it's gonna dip though... it has to. i'm not a skeptic at all, i'm just saying the runup right now is unsustainable.

192 nocoiners
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:21:37
well yeah its a bit snarky because every "whatever-K" always is harped as a "barrier" around here - 17K has literally no significance... everyone acts like a master trader on this subreddit, but they can't even tell you what the significance of
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

because the price doesn't reflect the value... i love this sub, anything related to a price drop is downvoted :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:27:02
yep. I have to second that ETH would be an 'apple' litecoin is LITERALLY a copy of bitcoin +/- a few parameters - if you're a developer you'd know this. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:27:12
'open source' just means it's public code somewhere, these days 99% likely to me public on GitHub. The programming language could still be any language.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:33:48
wow, a top voted post relating to code and technicals... am I still on @_date: 2017-08-07 17:22:14
yeah, i'm a software developer, and i just keep seeing more and more opportunities for tasty products that could make these processes a lot more user friendly
but as for now, its a fast moving and exciting do-it-yourself environment! :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:11:18
thanks man, just sent 23498 BTC there! that's not too much, right?
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:16:42
yep, leading to a BTC market cap of 170 trillion dollars, almost double the world's GDP. but you're right, it could be even more aggressive.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:34:52
bad math if true
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:11:28
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:24:45
i have a question about this... isn't this literally, buy however many bitcoin you want right now, then sell both coins after the fork, literally doubling your money? 
what are the risks here? do i, as a tiny player, run the risk of the replay attacks and whatnot?
otherwise, im bout to yolo and do just that
5K = 10K????  (ok for me probably like 1K = 2K, but you all know what i mean)
with love,
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:59
you’re all rediculous... fork or no fork, HODL!
