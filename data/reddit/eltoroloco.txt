Give it time and it will be $2017

Same here. It happens on Coinbase's website and app. I hope this gets resolved. I'm trying to capitalize on this dip

Coinbase started allowing Bitcoin Cash trades without announcing it first, and suspiciously did so after it went up 30% in value. This leads to the assumption that someone at Coinbase is doing insider trading.

I would try to find valuable assets to purchase with BTC. Probably considered money laundering, though.

I bought a little bit of everything. Gives me more to hodl on to

It’s been several hours since we hit the day’s low. I’m optimistic
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:43:12
It took a month to go from 4k to 5k. It's been 3 days since it hit 19k for the first time. There may be a 19k bubble, but it's not *the* bubble that some people refer to.

Considering the moon is 384.4km away from Earth, we still have a ways to go
Edit: forgot a few zeros. It’s 348k km

Buy the dip, boi
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:09:01
I want a Ferrari with the license plate HODL, but that would mean I have to sell
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:23:17
This is it. I don’t know what your interest rate on loans is, but it must pale in comparison to the returns on BTC.

It’ll loosen up after Christmas dinner
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:14:49
Suddenly I’m not so angry about the hit and run someone did to my car last night
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:36:08
This guy dips

Bitcoin is backed by the blockchain. What is the US dollar backed by?

Check your account number at the bottom of your personal checks. My credit union ignores the first 6 digits.

Binance, but you have to have BTC in order to get started

Just over a week ago, BTC dropped $3,300 in 2 days. It bounced right back up 2 days later.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:28:52
My regret is selling my only 2 coins a week after i bought them in 2013. I didn't buy again until $5k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:05:12
It's gone up ~~$250~~ $320 in the past hour. I don't know why I'm not buying more right now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:22:29
One more reason why I use credit unions
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:46
I've been edging all god damned day
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:25:53
Seems like a pretty good metaphor for the current market situation
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:04:32
I told everyone that I would sell my original investment at 10k, and let the profits ride.
I think I might have told a lie.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:06:25
We're past halfway there!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:31:13
*right* you are
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:08:33
I really don't think there's a "bad" time to buy. There's just better times. I bought in a couple weeks ago at $5700 and already made 26% off it. I think I will buy in again right after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:44
This is about as accurate as it gets
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:23:55
back to reality
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:45:35
I'll see you on the moon, friend

Captain Gains sounds like a superhero who specializes in weightlifting

That was me in January. Holy shit.

It’s like breaking a ten dollar bill for ones.  It doesn’t really make a difference.
