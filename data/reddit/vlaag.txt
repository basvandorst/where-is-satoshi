how do decentralised exchanges will be paid for their added value? there should be multisign atomic swap or something like that ?
if it is only between 2 parties, only transaction fees count

Damn it is taking so long to load this movie. I could get two transactions settled in this time ��

rent the house for 1 year and keep the 50% in fiat aside, maybe there will be a great opportunity to buy in at another dip. 
gratz on your milestone!

How will money keep its value if where all in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:11:29

I think the last one crushed bytom :)

Like it, but not a viable solution. Already putting that trust in a coin that in its infancy seems like a far stretch

this! have multiple wallets... just as you have a saving account on the bank: less easy to access
