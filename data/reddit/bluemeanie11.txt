no not several years, NYS is already on it and it'll be on the tracks in a month or so.

werent you invovled in the pirateat40 thing?
and what is your name?  I want this on record that you've claimed that I've commited a crime publicly. I hope you realize that these sorts of things have very real legal implications.
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:47:25
a few important points:
1) CFB claimed not so long ago that N was 'urban legend'
2) many of the ideas being referred to here as solutions are fictional technical ideas that have never been defined.
The 'NXT community' is not reliable in their statements.  The NXT software is simply not credible and thus not secure.
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:25:24
are the these people seriously this dumb?
you want to transact in some device that is not legally recognized, and not only do you admit that- YOU FLAUNT IT, then you feel indignation that some problem happened causing you some loss in the terms of this currency.
welcome to reality bitcoiners!  this is why we have laws.
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:52:20
brilliant idea.  lets get a bounty together for someone to write up some bylaws and such, so we can ignore them and decentralize the organization.  STEP TWO: proceed to attack anyone who suggests our ideas suck, conclusion: this is going to awesome QED.

"rap genius"?
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:47:49
thats precisely right.  What these morons don't understand is that this is not only a circumstance of bitcoin, they (inadvertantly) DEMANDED this!  They are immature little twits who view the law only on one side- in terms of penalties and obligations to themselves personally- but cannot see the function it serves in cases such as this.
we're really dealing with socially stunted individuals incapable of operating in civil society.
and another point- the NYS regulations would actualy fix this and the 'bitcoin community' is resolutely opposed to them, or at least that's what Erik Vorhees(a promoter of various Bitcoin business concepts) tells us.

well i happen to be a rap genius, so he stole my idea.

the name "entropy" is the lamest attempt at getting people's attention I've seen in some time.

the people who are on that thread basically do nothing aside from post garbage to that forum all day long(primarily to a thread entitled 'Price Speculation').  I can only imagine what their actual lives are like.

hey there.  Yes Open Transactions is a joke.  Counterparty is not perfect, but it's serious and the devs are serious.

my favorite one:  "Retained earnings and profits of the company can ONLY be invested in US dollars: Federal bonds, state bonds, or money market funds."
as in- how do we get crypto-capital back under our control?

good lord! are you stalking me?
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:12:22
you didn't answer my question- were you involved in the pirateat40 thing?
this WAS a real legal issue, unlike these bogus claims being made against me by anonymous posters.
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:13:13
talking shit?
it's called *reality*.
Open Transactions turned out to be exactly as I said it was- a lot of hot air and wasted time.  Seems Im one of the few people who has the knowledge, willingness, and time to actually look closely at these projects.  I'll be supportive if I encounter something that is worthy of support.
At this point the only credible cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:51:44
what the hell are you talking about?  might look that way if you're an open transactions fanboi.  Say hi to Lovedrop for me.
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:40:51
Excuse me?
are you suggesting I broke the law?
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:01:25
are you that stupid to think that you can just say someone commited a crime on the internet?  I've seen people try and do this sort of thing before, usually clueless idiotic kids who think the internet is a place they can do what they please without any reprecussions.  You sound very much like one of these stupid kids.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:15:35
you do know that Chris stole the monetas domain from me?
Chris has been saying 'exciting' and totally empty things for years.  What happened to Open Transactions?  Apparently Chris pissed off a number of software engineering professionals since his encounter with me.  Interestingly Chris and Johann seem to be friendly with the imfamous 'Nxthaus' project.  Not surprisng.
Your problem, and many people like you is you are wading in the shallow waters of marketing bullshit that will never get you anywhere- certainly not to personal financial freedom.  But this isn't my problem.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:25:33
um, ok?  I always wondered if Chris would one day combine his pickup artist superpowers with his brilliant knowledge of anonymous cash payments.

The *whole story* is that this person CfB created this retarded character named BCNext who supposedly founded the project ,holds the majority of the stake in NXT, and runs this relatively demented cult consisting mainly of european soccer hooligans.  He has never made a single consistent statement regarding his software.  By addressing this project as something consistent, credible, and secure you basically forfeit your credibility.
I wandered into the project with nothing but curiousity not much longer than a month ago and somehow got blamed for stealing money.  This was after a number of events happened, even the actual theft of over $200,000 worth of bitcoin from the NXT forums(this was deemed unworthy of investigation).  Since the witch hunt against me began, NXT has dropped in market cap by more than 20 million dollars.
CfB himself checked in code designed to prevent the addition of a feature that was approved by committee, probably because he saw my increasingly louder criticisms of his cult as a threat.
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:59:25
wow he should get a nobel prize for this.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:43:18
Ive been in digital currencies for a while, and this was going on even before Bitcoin.  I imagine it was going on in times/places that don't have the sort of framework we have in most 1st world places.
I do think our system is broken, but these people are not offering a remedy. Im disillusioned.  I dont think it'll be fixed until after it collapses completely, and that IS where were going.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:29:13
notice they needed to repost this back at the propaganda mill so that they can cover my statements(all true) with more of the typical cult BS.

just look at the title of this Reddit post!  It's this kind of nonsensical misleading garbage that seems to be the status quo in this space.  The author of this article clearly did not suggest that PoS and 'Distributed Consensus' are incompatible.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:39:06
well the NY bitcoiners have to comply with state law if they are incorporated in NYS.  There may be a few advantages to operating under the aegis of NYS law, but these days the taxes are so high companies are fleeing- asmof NYS recently rolled out a program to offer tax breaks for businesses that incorporate in the Empire State.
If they are incorporated in Arizona or Nevada, different story.
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:20:50
Are you saying that I've commited a crime?
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:54:58
absolutely- note that many of the Bitcoin Foundation people also appear to be staff writers for Forbes Magazine.
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:19:34
they did?

"this site is totally legit."
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:28:40
right- if it's not legal money, and bitcoiners demand it maintain this ambiguous status, then it's not theft.
it's just like the Silk Road case- he makes millions of dollars and accepts bitcoin as payment for his 'goods' - but then turns around and claims it's not money.
show me where in the lawbooks it says it's illegal to 'steal' a bitcoin?  as far as the law is concerned it's a record in a database.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:04:49
California will follow with a simpler version.

there are two possible outcomes- they can remain in this unregulated lawless zone where there is no prosecution for fraud, theft, embezzlement and what have- or - they can join civilization and operate under a lega/judicial system.
problem is they want the advantages of BOTH- again- immaturity and ignorance.
and yes Bitcoin is populated by sociopaths of different stripes all looking to act out their criminal or deranged agendas.  There are some good people I think, that see the need for alternative standards- and naturally all the bad people highlight this justification on every one of their scam operations.
