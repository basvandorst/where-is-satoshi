It's like people think its at $155 and not $15,500. How dangerous is it to accelerate at this pace without a correction?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:57:49
strengthening my atl positions now. These delays on deposits are depressing.

That's some quality meme right there

This is EXACTLY what I was thinking. Previously in weeks, when BTC went up BCash would crash everytime. And when BCash was rising it was because BTC was falling. 
The market trends for BCash have changed completely since the Coinbase listing. It's new trend is moreso in line with BTC. 
Would this be a security issue with digital currency? Do currencies have individual markers to determine when bot manipulation may occurring?
Thank you for taking the time to respond.

I was wondering if someone could explain something to me in regards to what I'm seeing on Coin Market Cap. 
BCash only has 16,872,488 BCH	circulating currency, and I'm sure there are some holding there. How is the volume  so high at $2,855,950,000? Are people just swapping between each other?
Ethereum has about a 6:1 advantage on circulating currency, and the volume is less.
Am I making something out of nothing? Clueless? Or something less? Still fairly new to it all, but this just struck me as odd.

Bitcoin :o.
%'s are a tad higher but it's pretty par for the course for what we've experienced these last few weeks.

These 100 coin sells are being eaten up and absorbed with no downward movement.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:25
I'm hoping those whales eat each other, and the coin survives. We have issues on major exchanges now with volume. Next week will be chaos I bet with wild swings. I'm preparing myself just in case.

Looks like Bittrex has removed all wallets! ;o Must be an error.

Just watched a buy order on gdax @ 15,300 of 202 coins....Oh boy this shit is fucking all the alt. coins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:41:11
They should just buy BitBay and integrate it!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:10:38
It started to 5min ago....then buy orders came in at 117.... 76....53....and we're going back to the moon. :o
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:41:33
Where's that volatile market I was hearing so much about? Looks pretty tame from here.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:41
Wooooo. I'd love to be apart of their tech team right now. Getting paid in BTC and getting OT :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:16:21
Hmmm did GDAX just crash?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:20:21
I just noticed google added Bitcoin to it's search currency converter widget.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:29:16
Darn. First time I seen it
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:15
Correction back to 10k in effect?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:27
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:31
I'm strapped in!

Clean design and doesn't contain clutter. I like it.

This is a big step towards adoption in the public sector. I suspect the steps will a basic framework for FedRAMP and HIPAA compliance.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:50:55
correct lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:35
I bought in at 10.8 and I'm stressed as fuck. :D 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:49:54
Hold onto your hats. It's about to go bonkers!
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:23:13
Thanks for the welcome. Quickly reading up on everything I can get my hands on.
Slightly in @ 10.8k Praying that this wave just got started.

It has a few centralized mechanisms around supply control. I don't understand the love for centralization. Can stick with fiat for that.
Also vague goal post for making it truly decentralized. When they become a fully decentralized project, they might have something that can drive adoption if ETH can ever do one thing right.

Some place high value in the opinion of an SME :)
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:15:19
Personally I'm against adding middle-men to any process. Whether it be DAI controlling supply, Oyster Perl running questionable code, EOS reversing fund transactions, etc....Crypto was supposed to move us AWAY from these tactics, not put a new generation at the forefront to screw over others.
I do, Bitbay. I won't shill points, but there are others who started decentralized, and continued to build off of that infrastructure. I'm sure Stable Report on Twitter could point you to a few others.
Why settle for half measures, when full-fledged solutions exist?

I've seen a ton of questions asked, I'm curious as to how Atomic Swaps tie into this?
By definition, this is a swap occurring at the application/exchange-specific level. Would that then make the exchange and/or application holder responsible for the taxes of each individual user?

Do it! We hitting 9200 today!
