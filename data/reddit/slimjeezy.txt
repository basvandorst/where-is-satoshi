the economy crashed back in 2008. If you didnt learn the lesson back then 
1. stop smoking pot all day everyday
2. 10 years is more than enough time to get your ducks in a row and 
3. Beware the Jew

that is a raisk, but much of the growth over the past month was from the current global financial shifts - which really, and I mean REALLY became serious after the sauid raid. Institutional investors - and I mean super wealthy multi generational wall street bosses - were FORCED to take refuge in bitcoin - something they were originally bent on destroying via a pump and dump. 
Now these guys have been in the currency bussiness for a very long time, but their main unit of wealth generation - interest from fractional reserve banking - is under serious threat due to Trumps america first policy. Starting a month ago with the Fed Chair Swap and (even bigger ) giant tax cut - Trump is basically saying to global finance if you want to play ball in MY house, (which is THE house - strongest economy in the world) youll have to play by MY rules.
This is a huge, huge threat to institutional investors, and while they havnt "officially" announced it, the global financial market entered retraction a month ago. This crash is going to fuck some countries up big time, but mostly developing economies. Ie Japan, USA, China, most of Europe are in the clear but man oh man is the brazil going to get ass blasted in the coming years... Theyve been floundering for decades and I really don't think they will be able to recognize and appropriately handle the HUGE pump and dump coming their way. From a global finance perspective - its akin to sacrificing one person to save a dozen...
But its just epic I could go on for days I would not be worried about it crashing below 10k indefinitely over the next 12 months. You will have growth above current interest rates. .

The best way to back up the BTC economy is to provide a service where you accept ONLY bitcoin as payment, whatever that service may be. 
People outside of the US/western markets with internet access provide real services online accepting only BTC as payment - whether its done nefariously (russian hackers) or by indian click farmers these are things of real value that back the BTC economy (not to mention distributed data processing from mining - inherently backing it up with computational power)

It certainly isn't the wisest thing to do in this society but as a biologist I tend to have the biased opinion that life trumps societal norms. Its only been 50-100 years humans have lived in this type of society, while our evolution curtailed our nature to something MUCH different. 
But yes I've been debt averse my entire life - just how I was raised. My dad had a good paying job and we were debt free and lived a very modest lifestyle, almost working class but not having to stress about unexpected car repair - tuition paid in full but at a state university after merit scholarships. Reasonably comfortable.  But I remember him saying once "I don't know how people can afford so much shit" 
Then the financial crisis hit. They couldnt dad, thats how. they couldnt... Which is why I love the log rather than exponential growth of bitcoin/ other crypto currencies. And they are backed by an enormous split data proccesing network/ the whole internet. 
Now that its has a serious foothold. If history is any clue - and I dont mean the past 7 years but more like the past 200 - there is no reason to believe (barring a mass sudden exodus from an EXTREME tail risk - like a nuclear war or something) that bitcoin wont double in the next 5 years (at least) compared to the US dollar. Time is money, literally.
