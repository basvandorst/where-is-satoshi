I don't want to be forced to consume.  I don't want to be trapped being productive my entire fucking life.  I could give a fuck if the economy grows for no purpose other than to grow.
Inflation is far greater than it is reported, for the average consumer.  Food, medical, insurance, education, real estate, and likely any other number of sectors not figured into the inflation calculation are up well over 2% annually, more on the order of 7%-15% annually.
Fiat is failing as we speak.  With Fiat, you will never be able to retire. You're lucky if you can afford insurance, and even with it, you will die penniless and in debt if you or a loved one is stricken with a severe, or heaven forbid, a chronic illness.  If you go to college, you'll spend the next 30+ years paying off the debt, if you're lucky enough to even get a job that requires a college degree afterwards.
Governments, institutions and corporations aren't geared toward making the world more comfortable and progressive so you have more free time to enjoy your life and your 'productivity'.  They're geared towards funneling money to the top and fucking you over so you're struggling to make ends meet every paycheck.  You're nothing more than a consumer, and nothing more than a producer.  Until you're not, then you get to die, expensively.  Unless you're in Europe, then you die comfortably ignored.
You're on a treadmill you can never get off of.
Fix the economy; fix society. Break the banks. Buy bitcoin.

Right now BTC will be testing the 21 month average, which is $8800-$9000.  Last time it did this in the 4 year cycle, it didn't drop below it, and it was up up up for the next 6 months until the ATH.  I'd be very careful about betting on it dropping below $10k, let alone hitting a $9k bottom before it breaks out again.
Of course, as soon as I hit 'enter' on this post, it'll plunge to $8800.
That's why I don't day trade.

You will need at least a 512gb hard drive for it, preferably 1tb, since it runs a full bitcoin node. I recommend an ssd. Probably the only upgrade needed. Will probably need a Linux geek to help get it running the 1st time. Their instructions are lacking.

Just leave the honeypots and let them get stolen once someone breaks the encryption. Then bitcoin will be forced to upgrade and become even more secure, if it hasn't already by then.

Treat it as a % cost of your total investment. Say you get a Ledger Nano S, about $60. When does the purchase make sense for you?  At a cost of 10% ($600) or 1% ($6000) of your investment?  How much do you feel comfortable leaving on the exchange - ie: what's your total loss comfort level, because exchanges do get hacked.

Equal playing field does not mean equal power distribution. It simply means if you own bitcoin, you can't be screwed like you can with fiat, by the government and by the banks.
The 1% problem will begin to solve itself when the funneling of power systems begin to collapse. For example, Visa and Mastercard have no place in a bitcoin future as they currently exist.  Their convenience-of-use costs 2-3% of every transaction, borne on the shoulders of businesses forced to use them, passed on to the consumer, who additionally pays interest on balances. 
May not sound like a lot, but if you spend $2,000/month on your Debit or CC, that's $50 in hidden tx fees.  I could sure use an extra $50/month. Lightning solves this, reducing the TX fee to less than 1%. Anyone can set up a lightning node - I'm setting one up now. I'll probably offer 5% off all btc sales, as soon as the Blockchain Promotion Act passes (H.R. 1361 - call your congressman) so I can do it without paying extra for a monetary license.
Anyway, imagine VISA/MC/AMEX/Discovery, etc. all losing 1/2 their business within a couple of years as lightning takes off.
I'd really like to be one of the new 1%. I promise I won't bite.

What's your standard of living? $50,000/year?  $100,000/year?  Let's say $75,000/year.  You'll need roughly $1.25 million in today's dollars to live from 65 to 80.  If you trust your chart, then by 2030 the curve flattens and bitcoin stabilizes at roughly $1 million/coin.  Therefore you'll need 1.25 btc to retire, assuming the chart doesn't include dollar inflation. If it doesn't, then 1.25 btc = future dollar equivalent of $1.25 million today.  Assuming, of course, reality happens to conform to the chart, as well.
Want to retire earlier? Get yourself up to 3 btc for the 2030 flattening.

When it meets all the criteria of good money and hasn't fully matured, apparently so.  Why don't you actually look up Gresham's Law? Bitcoin can not be debased, nor can its price be controlled or made equivalent.  Thiers' Law will apply (already does, depending on your view of global finances), and the free market will determine based on information dissemination, which is only growing, and software maturation for use (adoption), which is only quickening.

Do you trust that fund injections go anywhere but to line the pockets of cronies after they pay minimum wages to dig ditches and fill them back in?
Do you trust that quantitative easing and negative interest rates will actually work?
Do you trust the government to begin paying down its debt?  It just went up $7 million in the 5 minutes it took to type this.
Do you trust your Hospitals and Pharmaceuticals to stabilize their prices from the current 5%-10% annual increase over the past 10 years?

What's true is that banks will fight to the death to protect themselves against their own obsolescence, instead of adapting.  It will not be a successful fight.
What's true is that governments will fight for banks, so long as the lobbying money keeps flowing from the banks. It will not.  You can't burn the candle from both ends in order to save the middle.
You can't kill this cat - for each death, it bounces higher.  You can't put it back in the bag - there are already too many kittens to catch.
Whether Bitcoin survives or not, it is the death knell for fiat.  It's just a matter of time, patience, and adoption. They only have minimal control of one of those factors.

If we're really at $1 million/coin in 2030, then 3 BTC should be plenty, assuming you're comfortable living within a budget range of $75,000/year (today's dollars).  Want to own a house debt free?

Stability isn't a requirement of Store of Value - just a desired feature.  If you bought gold at $2000/oz in 2011: is gold no longer a store of value because you lost 25% if you're forced to sell now?  What's the arbitrary cutoff point?
What if you bought gold for $250/oz in 1970? Is 570% increase just too large to be considered a store of value?  What's the arbitrary cutoff point?
The 2008 real estate bubble pop? That was great for store of value, wasn't it?
Never mind the consistent failure of fiats just about everywhere and when - great stores of value.
Like I said in my first response, if bitcoin was going down over time, I'd exchange even more, particularly since use is increasing and word is spreading.  Until and unless there's a technological/mathematical aspect that indicates a failure of core security, or there's a better replacement - neither of which your questions have demonstrated.
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:56:54
Adjust for your own situation. The idea of accumulating is based on a conviction that bitcoin will be around and continued to be adopted, which means it will increase in price - do enough research so you have at least that base conviction. 
For me, this is a savings account, as much as an investment, with the potential bonus of 10x increase within 2 years, 100x increase within 6. For what I've put into bitcoin, I probably would have cleared that debt in the same amount of time as bitcoin hitting it's next parabolic peak, but this way I hope to keep 90% of my savings, clear the debt, and have yet more to save for the future.
The risk is, I lose everything I've put into bitcoin, and am stuck with the debt, but, frankly, that's really not much of a different future than I'm living now, so it wouldn't be a life-changing loss.

Define eventual. The dollar is backed by 'nothing' but the U.S.A.'s guns. Are you enthusiastic about the dollar?  I'm certainly not.
Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, cryptography, and decentralization - this is not nothing.  It can't be physically taken down, and the only risk is that one day the cryptography might be broken, and that's a serious challenge, even for quantum computers. This makes bitcoin mightier than the gun, so far as I'm concerned.
If it goes down to 5 cents, no I wouldn't be enthusiastic, but the only way that's happening is if something better comes along, which there currently isn't.  Do you have anything else to add to the conversation, or just more whimsical asinine questions of doom?

It is revolutionary, even with thousands of other altcoins, and there are few with the same utility, and none surpass what it does. Please enlighten me if there's an altcoin on the horizon that is actually better.
It is fully decentralized - it can not be confiscated, it can not be controlled, it can not be destroyed. 
Anyone can use it - the only thing that can take it from you is a loss of willpower under physical threat and force. 
It is freedom and power for the unbanked and the non-credit worthy.
It promises freedom and escape from the financial institutions for those wishing to save their money without devaluation.
Yes, right now it is entirely the promise of a get-rich quick investment, but the underlying hope and freedom built-in to Bitcoin makes it so much incredibly more than just a 'scheme'. It's its own declaration of independence.

Banks won't clear a transfer for 3-10 working days, though the withdrawal will show up immediately.  Coinbase doesn't credit your account until it's 'cleared' from the bank.  Your BTC will be bought at the price at the time you executed it, but it won't show up in your account for those 3-10 days.

It's difficulty for the sake of the security of the currency.

Walls are huge stacks of bitcoin on the buy/sell order book.  They're transient, since anyone can remove an order, but you'll see whales throw them up occasionally as psychological price warfare. When you see a wall order actually being completed, it tends to set a very short price top or bottom as orders go around it.
Shorts are when people gamble on bitcoin price dropping over a period of time. Longs are when they gamble on the price rising.

It will depend on the exchange.  BTC has a built-in transaction fee requirement, but it can be set by the user. Some exchanges will eat this transaction fee (like [pro.coinbase.com]( so pulling your btc off the exchange is free. Some set it high enough to ensure it will process in the next block, so it can be pricey for smaller withdrawals.
Personally, I use a ledger nano S, and only keep about 10% of my coin on an exchange (I mostly use pro.coinbase, but have fiddled around on Binance). Whether you use a hardware or software wallet, be certain you've played around with it long enough to be comfortable moving larger amounts, and figure out how to back-up and restore. Protect your key, and check every wallet address generated before completing a transaction. 
It feels great to be your own bank, but you have to be very, very careful.

This would be a game changer for U.S. businesses looking to adopt bitcoin payments. Well, ones interested in following the law, anyway, who've realized accepting or paying with bitcoin for products/services technically falls under their state's Securities Commission and requires a monetary transmission license.

My bank puts a 7 day hold on all deposits to coinbase - other banks can be quicker or slower.
You can purchase two ways:
Coinbase pro has much less expensive fees, but you have to wait for the deposit to clear before you can use it. This is fine if you do regular deposits, and the price of bitcoin doesn't matter that much to you.
On regular coinbase, you get charged a much higher fee to make a direct purchase, and you will get it at the price indicated, but their price is usually $50 or so above market, the fee is much higher, and you can't move the bitcoin until the bank has clear your deposit (7 days or so).
I do weekly purchases on coinbase pro with regular small deposits.  If there's a massive price dip worth the extra $50/coin and the higher fee, I'll do that (not often at all).
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:03:12
Good advice.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:54:30
Buy bitcoin. Don't worry about the cost/coin, you can buy it fractionally.  Watch Andreas Antonopoulos videos to fully  understand bitcoin.  
Don't buy XRP - it's a banking tool, and the coin has no value beyond what the banks decide for it.  Don't be a tool for the banks.  Wait for an upswing then divest.
Sure, bitcoin might fail, but if it does, so will every other cryptocurrency, because they're all underpinned by bitcoin's success/failure.  Bitcoin is the only proven coin, and it's the only true free-market coin - completely decentralized and uncensorable.
If bitcoin follows the magic rainbow predictions, it will peak over $100k next year, and resume after a crash down to $20k-$30k.  If it doesn't, you're no worse off than before, if you can truly afford to spend $100/month.
I'm not a financial advisor; I invest in bitcoin to disrupt the system for personal financial freedom.
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:11:38
I'd also factor in the novelty factor in being a first adopter in an area - even if people don't spend their bitcoin, the fact that a business accepts bitcoin raises interest, helping spur adoption and drive business. $160 of a marketing budget, even for Mom and Pop, really isn't that bad.
The fees to transfer and convert are minimal on a decent exchange: ~0.3%.  The volatility is the bigger risk.

Treat your phone's wallet like a leather wallet and only put as much bitcoin as you're comfortable carrying, as with cash.
If the store accepts bitcoin, they'll likely generate a QR code for your invoice.  You do your wallet thingy, scan QR code, approve the payment, they get enough confirmations to feel comfortable handing the coffee over (&lt;1 minute with lightning), and you're done.
If you don't want to use a phone, wait for a hardware wallet with QR scanning capability (might already exist, too lazy to look).

Not quick, but if you're running computer(s) 24/7, may as well put nicehash or honeyminer on it and let it do some work when you're not using it.  Honeyminer pays out in bitcoin, and your computer can be crap without GPU and still earn a couple of satoshi each day.

It was a risk/reward scenario for early adopters.  It still is - this is still early adoption.  Because of the infinite divisibility capability of bitcoin, it doesn't matter how many coins are lost.  It would be the opposite of hyperinflation - zeros will be added to bitcoin, instead of removed.
The power distribution problem is a complicated one - but the way bitcoin is setup, it is a major power disruptor  the farther along adoption occurs.  It will help people on the bottom, who will no longer need banks, or credit approval - they won't be subject to the financial power arrangements designed to keep people down ($18+ overdraft fees, $3 atm fees, etc.)  At the top, banks will lose power, government will lose power.
But, yes, people with lots of bitcoin will become the new power structure, but how they choose to wield it is anyone's guess, because it can't be in the same manner as it's wielded now, due to the existence of btc itself. It could be similar or worse, hopefully better.  I'm betting we'll find out.

Selling your holdings on Robinhood is a taxable event, and in addition you'll likely have to wait 3-7 days for the money to move to your bank account, and then another 3-7 days to move it to another exchange, with a big bitcoin price change risk while waiting, plus any additional fees you may incur on the trades themselves.
I recommend just open an account on an exchange where you can move your coins to your ledger, continue investing, and hold what you have on Robinhood until the price meets your desired target for profit taking.  If you're comfortable with the profit you already have, or are more concerned about a Robinhood hack than you are potential losses in leaving, ignore this advice.
On coinbase: if you use Coinbase Pro, the fees are nearly the best of all the exchanges - the catch is, you can't make an immediate purchase unless your fiat is already deposited, so you'll have to wait 3-7 days for your money to deposit there before making a purchase.  Not a problem if you're just DCA.  On coinbase (regular), they charge such a high fee to lock in the current price so you don't have to wait for the deposit.  However, you will have to wait 3-7 days before you can move the bitcoin.  I reserve using Coinbase for sudden dips I can't cover with my fiat in CB-Pro - occasionally the price on a big dip is worth the extra fee and market mark-up.

I don't think the general public's opinion of bitcoin will make the slightest difference for the future of bitcoin - the security, trustlessness, and uncensorable nature of bitcoin makes its continued adoption in the face of an increasingly unstable political and financial environment inevitable - among those with "power" amounts of money (really, most of us here are small players, just along for the ride).  
This doesn't even have to involve the consumer/merchant level, and so far it hasn't except as a fringe element, and probably won't until volatility settles down, and ease-of-transaction catches up with existing tx systems. We're seeing some merchant level adoption, but most of it is through 3rd party, and highly unreliable.  It's a step, but so far still on the fringes.
If 2021-'22's bitcoin bottom is $35k, then it will be a final proof of sorts - given 2018's bottom of $3.5k, and 2015's bottom of $350.  Then, expect $350k bottom in '26-'27.  That's probably about when average joe will feel they *need* to have some bitcoin (if they haven't been burned by the 2 FOMO events of '20 and 25'), but by then we'll just be calling them Sats (well, Kilo-Sats).

Yeah, a confusion, but people who use bitcoin are familiar with the lightning network, even if they haven't tried it yet, and they're our target audience with this. This is their chance to try it out, locally and in-person, and then they'll spread the word and explain the difference, and convenience will ultimately win.
The wait time for on-chain transactions is a very real problem for the retail environment, as well as TX fees for small purchases (most of our sales are small). Are you gonna hang around 15 minutes before we serve  your $1.99 coffee or give you your $2.99 DVD?

This isn't financial advice - you could lose everything, and I'm just a random internet guy.  But, if you outright own the home, mortgage it at 80% on a 15 year loan, or just get a good HELOC.  This should free up \~$85k.  Invest \~30k in solar to lower your monthly overhead, forget about farming or travel, and put the rest (\~$55k) into bitcoin and just wait (with your bitcoin on a hardware wallet - not the exchange).  Work your ass off for a year or two to cover your current normal expenses + mortgage.  Buy more bitcoin with anything left over.
At btc=$100k (2020-21), sell 1 bitcoin, pay off the loan and cover the taxes of the btc sale.  Keep working, but drop the second job and relax a little bit.  Bitcoin will be crashing down to \~$35k, so just hold onto your pants and your bitcoin until 2024.  Then retire.

Because the gains are so ridiculously higher than interest on my credit cards; I’m playing debt service (min. balance payments only) on my outstanding balances until my BTC balance from one year ago is enough to pay off my debt entirely, or until my BTC balance from one year ago added to my income is greater than my current tax bracket. 
This way I don’t fully lose my BTC position, I can continue to DCA a small amount weekly and keep growing my position, and I’ll be able to wipe out my debt in one blow, in far less time and with far fewer $$, which will feel great. 
If you follow this path, define your risk positions, so you can stop DCA and pay more debt when BTC goes too high. For example, mine is $35-$40k BTC until ATH - stop buying BTC until ATH, pay down debt until ATH, sell my year-old position at ATH to keep tax burden low, pay more debt, resume BTC DCA after retracement.

I put .01 btc into Whalelend (similar pitch as BlockFi) about 2 months ago.

The rates seem to go in spike waves, though, so maybe that'll change. If I'd been willing to risk .1 btc, there would have been no fees, but since I don't trust anyone anywhere, I wasn't willing to risk more.

When satellite internet systems launch, internet access during blackouts won't be much of an issue, save an orbital EMP or 24-hour solar flare that wipes the whole world out (bigger worries, then).
A car with a small inverter can run a regular modem and computer right now (and can charge phones without one) - so power, even through extended black-outs, isn't really a big big issue if there's gas available. Once satellite internet phones start popping up and getting cheaper (which will happen shortly after these launch and are proven), there'll be very little downtime, even after big disasters.

Everyone smack talks coinbase here (and they did clearly market manipulate when bch came out), but it works just fine and has a good security history.  If you do try coinbase, use [pro.coinbase.com]( \- the fees are much better, and they eat the tx fees when moving bitcoin off the exchange. 
The regular coinbase has higher fees because it's geared towards a quick purchase to lock in a btc price, so they're risking your funds being denied after the fact, and they lock your btc from being moved until the bank clears your withdrawal.  If you give yourself enough time margin, you can deposit fiat directly to pro.coinbase, and be prepared for buying a good dip without the fees.
Whatever you pick, do get a hardware wallet and pull your bitcoin off the exchange once you have enough to justify the purchase of one. No exchange is perfect, and they're all at risk of being hacked and suffer the arbitrary whims of regulators and lawmakers, and even if the exchange has 'insurance' on the coins, you'll just be a number in line if your coins are stolen.

Welcome to the echo chamber. What you're seeing is in no way 90% of the general opinion about bitcoin. I'd like to think most here understand the fundamentals of bitcoin: security, trustlessness, decentralization, uncensorable, and that that's the foundation of their investment and what keeps people invested in bitcoin after their greed fades and jades from the excitement and novelty. I'm a dreamer, though - everyone here is probably 90% greed, too.
No one can accurately predict the future, especially the highs and lows - but history tends to rhyme, and the people making these predictions are simply looking at the historical behavior of bitcoin. If so, then yes, bitcoin is due for a bubble bull run in 2020. The general public will see a FOMO opportunity, again, and a lot of people will get burned by their greed - that's the 90%.
To me, the more important aspect for continued bitcoin adoption and longevity will be the low on the other side of the next bubble. The lows have always been higher than the previous lows, generally by 10x.  So, if it holds true again, it will be \~$3k (2018) to \~$30k (2021-22). Even the next low will be at a better position than I'm in today, so the promised bubble is irrelevant to my long-term investment, except as an indicator when to stop buying (while 90% are starting), take some profit, and when to resume buying.

tl;dr: Not too late.
Bitcoin has a history of moving in bubble/burst cycles.  Do some research, and have an idea of your buy limits before investing.
Because of the massive price swings bitcoin experiences daily, right now the best investment strategy is DCA (dollar cost averaging).  Spread your buys out over time, and keep track of the average cost. Once you get a feel for the market, you can try to time your buys for daily/weekly down-swings, but they are very hard to predict and to wait for.  Just remember the long-term trend for bitcoin has always been up, so if you DCA and just buy once/week, or once/month, your average will generally stay below the market price.
If you don't already have one, pick an exchange and get it set up right now - it will take about a week or so to get all the KYC (know-your-customer identification process) approvals done and your bank account linked, and then each deposit will likely take a week to clear for use (banking issue, not exchange issue). 
I started with [coinbase.com]( but use [pro.coinbase.com]( (same account) because the fees are much better, and since I'm DCA'ing, I don't need to make immediate purchases with ridiculously high fees, and can wait a week for my bank to clear deposits.
Once you have some money invested, look into getting a hardware wallet, like a trezor or ledger, and pull bitcoin off the exchange that you won't be selling anytime soon.  For example, to keep my future tax burden low, I will only sell as many coins as I bought, up to 2018, when 2020 rolls around.  Anything more than that, I store on a ledger nano s, so it's not at risk of exchange problems.  For me, it's a long game, and there will probably be at least one more big bubble cycle after 2020.  The bottom after the bubble will probably still be higher (\~x3) than where we are now, so it will be more difficult to accumulate afterwards, so holding my base investment through the bubble will keep me in a good position.
Keep your eye on the prize (long term investment), and don't get sidetracked by shitcoins or price drops.  It could reasonably swing as low as $7500 over the next couple of weeks, or it could shoot up to $20k and just hold there until the bubble starts.  Don't panic.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that is decentralized, trustless, scarce, un-censorable and non-conterfeitable - it can not be forcibly shut down, it can not be controlled. It is thus far unique and proven in its capabilities. Watch these videos by  [Andreas M. Antonopoulos]( to gain an understanding. I also recommend watching videos of anti-bitcoin people, so that you can decide for yourself.
The best way to start in bitcoin is to open an account on an exchange (read all the links on the right side of this sub), and make smaller purchases over time using a dollar-cost-average system. This will give you time to understand the market, get a feel for what's a good price, and help keep you from panicking with your money during the massive price swings that happen. Whenever I purchase, it seems to drop $1k in the next 4 hours - just hold on to it, it goes back up. Or buy more, and adjust your cost-average downward.  Just remember, you're not buying stock - you're investing in financial freedom (and all the risks that come with that freedom).
Once you have enough invested to justify purchasing a hardware wallet, and if you've come to believe in the future of bitcoin - buy a hardware wallet and move your bitcoin off the exchange.  Congratulations, you'll be your own bank.

The only way there will be a large scale integration is if more merchants accept bitcoin directly (not through 3rd parties like Lolli or so-called crypto credit cards).  Lightning makes an appropriate discount  possible (\~5% less expensive than banking &amp; credit card tx fees), and software like btcpayserver is also making it possible.
Both have some more development before they are truly easy to use and implement, though. I'd give it 3-5 years before we start seeing "Bitcoin accepted here" stickers on more than the 1 in 500 odd store.
This is entirely different than large money moving into bitcoin - that should start to happen before integration, possibly before year's end.

They should be the same account log-in.  If you bought it on coinbase, there will be a 3-10 day lock on moving your coins anywhere, as they are waiting on confirmation from your bank for the fiat deposit.
To move coins to coinbase pro, be in coinbase pro, select 'deposit', choose your currency, and then there should be a tab for 'coinbase account'.
If this doesn't work, contact their support.

This is not competition to bitcoin - it is not a distributed ledger, nor is mining distributed.  It will not affect bitcoin much, even if it takes off.  Bitcoin's primary goal is trustlessness through security and distribution.
Metal Pay is a centrally controlled payment system with an internal 'token', and thus subject to single point failure: the company behind it.  It is competition to paypal, visa, mastercard, and will succeed or fail based solely on it's GUI, ease of use, and market networking. It is nothing new - not on its technical or ideological foundation. It is seeking to solve a single problem - ease of transaction - which bitcoin has thus far 'failed' to achieve (not bitcoin's purpose, but true, nevertheless).  [Metal Pay Whitepaper.](
However, bitcoin, through layer 2 applications (Primarily Lightning), is on the cusp of dominating and destroying payment processing systems as they come online and become easier to use.  Metal Pay will likely be dead on arrival.

Honestly just leave it on Robinhood for the moment, but don’t spend more there. Find another exchange and start an account.
Robinhood might eventually add wallet tx support, but even if they don’t, the wait for your cash to come to you and then go to the new exchange is a lifetime right now, almost guaranteed to lose you btc and future returns.
@_date: 2019-08-26 16:28:22
You can't withdraw your bitcoin directly from Robinhood (at least not yet - they keep saying they'll add this feature, but no timeframe).  You'll need to sell them, then withdraw the fiat, then repurchase bitcoin somewhere else where you can withdraw bitcoin.  You'll have to pay fees, and you may need to wait up to 2 weeks for the money to be moved twice (first to your bank, then to another exchange).
I would recommend, for the moment, leaving it on Robinhood.  Set up an account on a real exchange where you can control your coins (Coinbase, Gemini, etc.), and then start building up more coins there.  Get a hardware wallet, figure out how to use it.
Then, you'll be in a better position to liquidate your Robinhood holdings.  Remember the big risk is time, since banks cause a 3-10 delay for moving money around, and you'll need to move it twice before you can turn it back into coin.  Better to be in a position where you'd be cashing it out anyway, or can time a bear-turn in the market that may last 1-2 weeks, so you can come out on top.

Not sure if Coinbase mechanics are different in UK (US here), but you should be able to move any of your wallets between coinbase and coinbase pro with no fee.
The fees here are max 0.35% for trading (lower fees for whales), and the only fees on deposits/withdrawals are for Wire or Sepa.  Take a peek at their help &amp; support pages, they should have a fees page appropriate for UK.
I honestly don't know how that compares to other exchanges, the only other one I've used is Binance, and I've pulled out of that one right after they announced kicking out U.S. customers.

It is always a good time to enter, even if there's an upcoming crash.  I entered at $6k in 2017, bought as high as $15k before the crash, then resumed buying at $10k on the down side; I recovered at the recent $9k btc (would have been a lot earlier if I hadn't made stupid decisions), and am now just hodling.  My plan is to sell 1/10 of my btc when it covers my $ investment amount, pay off some debt, and then use that extra monthly income to boost how much btc I will continue to buy each week.
Don't throw all your money at it at once, then you'll have a big emotional + financial investment that you'll feel you have to 'tend to', and you may make poor decisions (I did, during FOMO/FUD of last parabolic).  Treat it like a savings account - both in how you buy (weekly or monthly) and how you hodl (until retirement).  Then you'll be very cautious to sell, and will enjoy buying when it drops.
You may wish you'd bought more, you may wish you didn't buy any, but if you commit a % of your disposable income each month and just do it and don't worry about the price, then your dollar-cost-average (DCA) won't be affected too much by the insane ups and downs BTC has seen and will see over the next decade.
And do your research - it's not just about 'making' money - you really should understand BTC, and not just its market predictions, so that you 'believe' in it through the downs.

Thank you for explaining the final predicted jump from $1 million to $10 million btc value. I've seen the claim before, but didn't get the basis for it, especially looking at the logarithmic regression curve predictions, most of which flatten around $1 million.  
If I understand, it's a point where the valuation of stocks is determined by bitcoin due to btc adoption, and therefore the value of bitcoin must begin to include the value of public corporations as adoption happens, and this value is far in excess of the circulating money supply.
This, however, presumes btc will be adopted as a global denomination.  Hope to see it happen.

This is my retirement fund, and is currently worthless in comparison to other people's 'investments'.  If I cash anything out, BTC will be over $100k, and I'll only take out enough $ to rid myself of some debt, so I can then convert even more each month into BTC while riding the last big bear wave down to the final meaningful bottom before the grande finale increase to over $1 million, where BTC reaches the effective end of its logarithmic curve.
I hope I have enough by then.
@_date: 2019-06-12 12:25:25
I'm pretty sure no one looked at the dates on this chart.  This isn't any more complicated than predicting a future curve based on past behavior, and is better at predicting bottoms than peaks, but they can be accurate over short time scales, as trends take time to play, and the bigger and more obvious the trend, the easier the prediction.
Scale the chart way out, and you get the predictions of 100k in a year, a million in 10.  Look at the past 3 weeks, and you can predict a drop to $7k late this week or early next week, before resuming a sideways, slightly upward act for 3 more months with a couple of other predictive shapes along the way, then the beginnings of the next parabolic bull run into 2020, which should peak around $150k before crashing to $30k and then starting a similar, but slower recovery on the way to $1 million.
Will any of this actually happen?  Dunno, they're predictions, and whenever I bet, I lose.  For me, it's dollar-cost average with whatever I can comfortably squeeze out of my paycheck every 2 weeks.

After trying a couple of different ways to accept bitcoin, that no one agreed on and were too messy/difficult to integrate into our software, the Breez Lightning Wallet proved to be perfect for our brick &amp; mortar sales. The Breez Wallet is fast and easy, but if someone associated with them is reading: you really should have a fiat conversion built in to make it even quicker to use.
We've added Lighting as an electronic processor into our POS (just like Visa or MC), and Breez is installed on an old I-Phone that's been locked to do only that. Training was as simple as 1 transaction walk-through per employee.
Unfortunately, we haven't solved bitcoin for our on-line sales yet, and won't have time to until after Christmas. I was messing around with BTCpayserver, but honestly, their instructions for setting up from hardware onto an Ubuntu server are too complicated and don't work if you don't want to set it up as a terminal.
So far, we've had 0 customers use it, but it's only been up a day. I'm still proud - I'm pretty sure we're the first Lightning store in town.

KYC requirements are making things very difficult, so if you have no luck with any of the other suggestions here:
Go to a faucet site like Cointiply(.com), do a couple of surveys and earn some bitcoin. It's hardly time efficient, but the coin is real and they do pay. It would take about a week with an hour commitment each day to earn 100,000 sats. They generally pay on Sundays for requests made before end of Friday.  No ID required.
Then you can use that to test out a wallet, or whatever you had planned, if the time requirements fit.

I would stick with the fundamentals: scarcity, security, and most importantly: decentralized. Then, half of the political topic that come up can be steered right back to bitcoin. Banks collapsing in India - buy bitcoin. Riots in Chili? Bitcoin. Starving in Venezuela? Bitcoin.
Also, download a lightning wallet on your phone and fund a channel.  Convince someone else to download one (take the initial funding time into consideration), and then show off how quick and easy and cheap it is to pay and receive payments.  This will have a bigger impact than any discussion - the new toy.

As close to the next parabolic peak as possible (&gt;$100k btc), I'll sell enough to recover my initial dollar investment to date (hopefully less than 1/10 of amount), then hodl, and start reinvesting again when it crashes to &lt;30k.
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:13:56
Yeah, we debated what to call it exactly, but decided it's best if we mention Bitcoin after Lightning, because we're only accepting Lightning network payments, so there's no 10+ minute wait on purchases.  Our average purchase amount is &lt;$30 so Lightning is perfect for this.

The more sideways movement, the closer the base trend-lines will follow to the actual price.  These lower trend lines are called support levels, but the price line will cross them without blinking, same as the trend lines above the current price. It's just a judgment on what people think the current 'bottom' and 'top' support level of the market is, and adds a nice psychological drama when those lines are crossed.  Generally referred to here as FOMO and FUD.
I recommend Kahn Academy's series on [banking and finance](  They have a great series on the 2008 financial crisis (that inspired bitcoins creation), as well as a series on Bitcoin.
IF past behavior is indicative of future behavior and bitcoin really is following a regressive logarithmic curve, then the bull run has barely begun, and a parabolic should start late '19 or early '20, with a high comfortably over $100k and a crash to &lt;$30k after.  It's a lot of fun to look at price/time predictions based on these, but you can't and shouldn't bank on them.  Set your own goals and limits, and don't convert more than you can afford to lose.

I'd say lightning is ready for widespread testing right now, just need to get merchants to accept it. The hold-back for most merchants (in U.S., if they've even bothered to look into it) is that they don't want to deal with the legal or operational headaches, which vary from state to state, so it's an even bigger headache if their company crosses state borders. 
Unless they have an owner willing and capable of matching all bitcoin sales to customers (ie: buying the bitcoin from their store at the exact amount used), and no sale on any given day is greater than $1,000 to any one customer, then they have to get a money transmitter license or use a third party exchange.  With a 3rd party exchange, transaction fees and liquidity time end up being the same or similar to Visa/MC, so there's zero incentive to accept bitcoin, lightning or not.  Call your state and federal representatives and urge them to change the money transmittal laws, and make crypto easier to use.
For person-to-person exchanges, lightning is absolutely ready.  Try it.

1. Lightning Network solves the tx fees and wait times for smaller purchases, and is in real-world 'testing' now.  Works great!
2. If you implement a spend &amp; replace tactic with bitcoin, it's no different a concept than paying your credit card off at the end of each month. The philosophy of "hodl" really applies more to the trading/investment and savings aspects of bitcoin (amateur traders generally lose money).
3. The biggest hold-up to using bitcoin as a day-to-day currency is merchant adoption, I believe - not holder unwillingness to spend. Their concerns are technical (how hard to implement), operational (how hard to train and use on a daily basis), financial (how quickly can it be converted without loss and made available as fiat), and legal (wtf IRS?).  The technical and operational are quickly being solved by any number of solutions. The financial is being solved by several exchanges, and can be bypassed if an owner is buying the bitcoin from the business (self-banking, re-investment). Legal, however, can be a real mess, and is probably the biggest obstacle, and probably why so few regional and national businesses accept bitcoin.

You can reduce your transaction fees considerably if you use Coinbase Pro.  Your existing Coinbase account will already work with it, you just need to go the other website and log in. Transferring your holdings between coinbase and coinbase pro is free.  Then you're not hit with the $2.99 fee for purchases, but a much lower % fee.

Looking over their agreement, my biggest issue is the $1 transaction charge.  I do maybe 20 transactions/week on my card, so maybe $10 would go in each week.  That would be a 10% fee.  If I don't spend a lot in a week, it's a 20% fee on a minimum $5 charge.
You also can't withdraw the bitcoin, only the cash equivalent, so if you want bitcoin, you'd have to lose more again repurchasing it elsewhere.

Given these conditions (identical to bitcoin, simply different starting conditions), then it would be purely a matter of marketing and financial backing to the worth of the initial coins as to whether it would work or fall on its face out of the gate.  
The corporations would have to sell enough of them for the free market to be involved who will then gauge its value over time. If they don't sell enough, it falls on its face, since they'll be clearly manipulating the market with whale moves.  If they sell too many, it's just another cryptocurrency, and we already have a well established one - why divest from btc?
It would have to bring something new to the table.  At least Facebook's Chuck-E-Cheese tokens will purportedly do that by using them as a direct payment method for the peasants, right out of the gate. We should wait on their white paper this week before judging too harshly, but I think the Chuck-E-Cheese moniker is here to stay. 
I'm pretty sure bigger corporations than Facebook's 100 odd bunch, are watching this experiment closely as well.

Not sure if this qualifies as long-time. I first bought in late 2017, bought on the way up and on the way down. I'll do it differently when the next parabolic is clear. In '17-'18 I should have stopped buying at 10k, and started again at 10k, but I didn't know enough and was caught up in the excitement and made a bunch of stupid decisions (ie: shitcoins, high-yield scams, buying near $20k) that cost me nearly 1/2 my investment.  Thankfully, I don't have much money, and didn't spend much, so it wasn't a very big loss. This month, I broke even with DCA on my stupidity with bitcoin above $9k.
Since 2018, once researching much more deeply into crypto &amp; blockchain, I only convert fiat to bitcoin, and I got rid of all my holdings in alt-coins, except some IOTA.  I convert a small amount of $ to BTC weekly, just treating it like a savings account.
On the next parabolic, I'll stop buying at $30k, then sell only enough to recover my initial year+ old investments and losses, as close to the peak as I can manage, hodl the rest, then continue buying once it's below $30k on the other side - based on current projections of the bottom on the other side. Will adjust that based on the trend lines the closer we get to the next parabolic move.  Sure, I could sell it all and re-buy at the bottom, but this could be the time it breaks pattern and I get screwed. That's what happens whenever I gamble, so I won't.
As far as I'm concerned, Bitcoin is now part of my retirement accounts, and I'd prefer not to touch it at all until I can live off of it to my current standard of living for at least 20 years (though the way I've lived I'll probably die much younger). I don't expect Social Security to exist by then, and I don't expect my IRA to be much help as the dollar inflates.  If it really surges to over $1 million/bitcoin on a future parabolic, I'll sell enough to pay off any debts and the rest of the house, but I'll hodl the rest, and continue to convert $ to BTC until I'm not working anymore.
Hopefully by then, everyone will just accept bitcoin.  If it crashes completely, I'm no more screwed than the guy next to me, who blew it all on BBQ and beer and has to live in a Section-8, 500 sf rental when he can't work anymore.

GBTC is not the same as owning bitcoin.  You will own shares in GBTC, and they own the bitcoin, and they charge \~2% annually for the privilege.  If he just wants to invest in BTC, this might be good enough, but it's much less expensive to just open an account through an exchange, which his broker should be able to do on his behalf.  I promise you his broker isn't going out on the floor of the stock exchange and playing with paper tickets - he's using software.

Since it's not open for anyone to mine or host a node, it won't be much more than a Chuck-E-Cheese token.  You'll just have a 100 places to spend them, until participants eventually cut their losses and start dropping out once people realize this.  
It won't hurt bitcoin as long as people are aware this token is only as strong as the companies involved and supporting it, and that it's not a true cryptocurrency.  It's doubtful this circle of companies will ever grow, as they'll lobby to keep competitors to their own products out (if competitors are even interested in the $10 million buy-in), even as use drops to zero after the initial speculation and popularity phases.

If entire nations of people begin using bitcoin for everyday trading and banking, then that's the fiatcalypse, and 0.5 bitcoin will be a very comfortable sum.
Spend no more than you can afford to piss away and enjoy the ride.

You should get a wallet (software or hardware, safer with hardware), learn how to use it competently (shouldn't take too long), make appropriate backups, keep your keys in a safe, separate place, and store the bitcoin  you plan to hodl.
With exchanges, if they are hacked, your btc is gone.  Coinbase has never been hacked, and has survived several attacks, but that doesn't mean they are 100% safe.  Coinbase is FDIC insured, but that only covers your USD balance - not your coin balances.  They do carry [other insurances]( but that's no guarantee for you if their whole site is hacked.  You'd just be another guy in line behind others who lost more than you.  Research the history of [BTC exchange hacks]( failures, and criminal activity.
There's a saying: not your keys, not your BTC.
Otherwise, Coinbase is as safe an Exchange as its peers.

Until they actually open up the mining and nodes to anyone, the cartel that holds those and the ability to create and burn libra will hold all of the power that Zuck-E-Cheese tokens manages to manifest.  Convenience is the bait and reward, the Master has changed but is the same.  Really, do we expect a group of corporations to manage a money supply any better or worse than the Fed or the ECB?  And they won't even be doing that, if they keep their promise of backing the coin with digital fiat.  It won't 'replace' anything but paper and coins.  Until they decide to try fractional reserve banking when no one's looking.
I'm pretty sure opening up is an empty promise in their white paper - they can put it off as long as they want. 'Open' will actually mean 'buy-in' for other heavy weights with good arcade games who are missing out if it catches on.  And their shared interests are what will govern Libra policy, not anybody actually using it.
I certainly won't deny the promised convenience factor, and I kind of even welcome it as 'intro to e-currency', but  it will only last as long as the cartel has shared interests and don't split apart, or they open it up to become a fully public crypto.  So, I will never convert a balance larger than lunch money into Libra, and I'll cash out any balance larger.

On a more serious note - pick a weekly/monthly amount, and just convert most of it to BTC without looking too much at the price.  Set aside a little bit of that fiat to buy extra during the 'dips' while we're in the bull market (no point buying dips in a bear market). There will be corrections on the way up, take advantage of them.  
Dollar-Cost-Average (DCA) your investment, and pick a point to stop buying when the parabolic hits, and decide if you want (need) to cash any of it in at the peak. Hodl the rest on the way down, and start buying weekly/monthly again as the curve hits below the next long-term recovery point (this last time was about 10k, if you look at the trend lines of the 1/2 way point between predicted parabolics).  If you'd bought consistently in 2018-now from 10k down to 3.5k and back up to 10k with weekly/monthly purchases, you'd be a very happy camper right now. Don't let the $ scale of the next wave unrattle you.
If you're in it to hodl for the long-long term, it shouldn't even matter if you continue DCA buying across this next parabolic up and down.  $20k was the last peak - BTC will possibly be above that before 2019 is over.  This next parabolic ('20 possibly) will likely be $100k+ (so stop buying at maybe $30k-$50k), and the bounce back from the drop might be as quick as 2 years, again. If you DCA and hodl, it won't affect your average cost much anyway.

The only cloud mining I would consider is through Honeyminer, and them only because they have a track record of actually paying people for cpu/gpu mining with their existing mining app, with no reports of malware, hacking, or fraud yet, which in this world, is a pretty good track record over 2 years. I've been using their app for about 18 months now on several older computers (10+ years old) that I have to leave on 24/7 anyway, earning me about 0.00721633 BTC (40k Sats/moth), which is probably worth far less than the electricity cost, but they were running anyway. This has allowed me to generate bitcoin for 'free' without investing in any mining equipment. Granted, it's next to nothing, but if you have computers on 24/7 anyway, I highly recommend this app - very easy to set-up, doesn't need monitoring, and can be set to run solely in background.
To be perfectly clear - they don't mine BTC - they mine shitcoins. But they pay out in BTC, so I could care less what they're mining. You're free to withdraw the bitcoin at any time, but their fees are steep atm (11.5k Sat \~$1). However, over the past few months, the payout has gone down, because the shitcoins are down relative to BTC and USD - so don't buy new equipment or waste electricity.
Honeyminer has just launched a cloud mining program, but I think it's still in beta and may currently be invite only. From what I can guess-timate from their pricing plans, you would NOT make more than you spend on the mining plan; it would be more like buying BTC at a discount over time, with no guarantees, since they don't mine bitcoin so the payout would be dependent on exchange rates on whatever they're mining. For example, the minimum mining plan is $1/day, the payout in BTC would be from possibly nothing to maybe $0.75 on a great day, so call it possibly a $0.25/day mean, so you get your BTC at a 25% discount, and that discount would be spread over time. These are all made up numbers from just glancing at snapshot hashrate returns for different shitcoins - I haven't tried it, so can't confirm anything.
With the volatility in the market, it would be very difficult to track and see if it was worth the investment, but right now the minimum cloud mining plan is $60 for a 3 month commitment - not a very big risk for anyone interested.

How much do you trust the bull market and all of the predictions of another parabolic in 3-9 months?  If you trust it a lot, hold until then, and sell .5 when it hits $100k, or 1 when it hits $50k -  wherever you're comfortable.  Don't forget to hold some fiat to pay for the tax on selling BTC.
How much are you paying monthly to service the debt?  I'm guessing $500-$600 / month. If that's too big a bite on your monthly cash flow and you're having trouble making ends meet - then sell some.  Personally, I'd grit my teeth, tuck in my belt, and wait for the parabolic.

Trading is stupid unless you're trained in market prediction methods and have nerves of steel and patience of Job to actually pull it off - successfully.  Most people don't have that.  By switching to just dollar cost averaging, I've reduced my losses from bad trades and investments when I jumped in idiotically and gung-ho during the '17 parabolic from 50% to less than 10%.  3 more DCA purchases, or another 5% gain, and I'm good.  And I don't worry or watch the market as much.

Treat it like a savings account and just convert what you can comfortably afford each month to BTC.  If you'd continued purchasing on the way down (and back up), instead of panicking and selling, you'd be in good positive territory right now.  Instead, you turned $1k into $300, and if you buy back in with another $1k, it feels like spending $1600.  Bitcoin may need to be $18k for you to 'break even', but if you sell at $18k and 'recover' your initial, you'll feel like crap if it then shoots up to $100k and you have no bitcoin.  
Remove your emotions from the equation, build it slower and steady, and set a 'sell' goal where you're not removing all of your bitcoin (and don't sell if you don't need it immediately), and then continue investing after that.
Dollar cost average your initial 'loss' on a spreadsheet, and wait patiently.

As long as fiat has value, corporations will judge themselves on the value of fiat, as they've always done. When bitcoin is the denomination, they will judge themselves in terms of bitcoin.  I don't think corporations will 'buy' into bitcoin or mining at all, excepting banks or financial institutions, who will have as much interest in bitcoin as bitcoin's success forces them to have.
For example, when bitcoin adoption hits a certain level of daily transaction level of purchasing goods at different stores, financial institutions will react by investing in mining farms (probably by just buying existing ones) to capitalize on transaction fees, and in online btc wallets for regular banking accounts.
Corporations with zero financial exchange interests in relation to their products will invest no more than they do in any other stocks or currencies. Accepting it as payment and keeping their own btc balance will grow as demand for it grows. Their concerns are income and growth related to what they produce.  The currency used is just a number.
I feel the switch to BTC is inevitable, but user GUI interface mechanics with BTC has to be continually addressed, so people who don't care will begin using it without fearing losses from just trying to own it, let alone use it.  It has to be much easier to use (and it already is compared to just 3 years ago), and I see that coming within the next 5-10 years as lightning is adopted and developers continue working on the software interfaces and security interfaces.  I also expect mSatoshis to be the trading denomination when this happens, not bitcoin.

1. You want a local wallet where you control the private keys. You don't have enough invested to justify purchasing a hardware wallet, but when you do, that's an even better choice. Local wallets, so far as I know, are mostly free - nothing fishy about it.
2. At 17, you probably won't be able to register on an exchange, so without the help of a trusted 18+ year old, you'll be limited to purchasing from somewhat sketchy (paxful) or expensive sources (atms). I would find someone you trust to do the exchanges for you and send you your bitcoin directly, until you hit 18 and can sign up at your own exchange.
3. Exchanges are platforms that allow you to convert fiat into cryptocurrencies.  Places like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Binance, and literally hundreds of others.  You should research them for security history, fees, and deposit/withdrawal limitations and time, then pick one you're comfortable with.  I prefer Coinbase Pro, but used Binance occasionally. Wasn't particularly impressed - then they shut out U.S. customers - I don't know if they ever opened their new U.S. exchange.

They only process withdrawals one day a week, but they do actually pay out.  It's a time wasteful endeavor, but it'll be enough to play around with wallet mechanics and see how it works without risking much.

This article is totally wrong. Assuming the fees on the CC purchases aren't absurd, it provides a convenient, competing on-ramp from fiat to crypto (vs. KYC exchanges). You can move your lightning bitcoin (anonymous) to a core wallet (pseudonymous) anytime you so desire, as well as the opposite.  This gives a quick avenue to anonymous, low-fee spending, free of record from both the bitcoin blockchain and from Credit Card records.

The financial and economic world we live in today is a vast pit of despair, and inspires nothing more than hopelessness, depression, and misery.

After working for 30 years, paying off a massive student loan, being stuck with 20 more years of a 30 year mortgage, raising 2 kids and cosigning even more massive student loans (to help start them in their journey down the pit), caring for a wife with autoimmune disorders, ignoring my own health to get by, working a job with little advancement or joy - there is no end to it except death.
