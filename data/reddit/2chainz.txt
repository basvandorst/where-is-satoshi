Why would I use Bitcoin to send funds when an alternative, litecoin for example, would only cost ~$1 to send funds? Even if we ignore USD, thats a fee reduction of about 18x.

Dude, chill.

You're just now figuring this out?

All journalism is highly sensationalized though. I'm not defending the lady in any way but to make money in journalism you have to stretch the truth. Not lie but stretch it

I have a hard time believing it will show up on their site while the current people are in charge

The inconsistency with his statements makes it appear that something malicious or "dirty" is going on. Maybe he was too embarrassed to admit he lost the keys and couldn't access the storage so he tried to cover it up with the malleability claim. But then he realized that showed how incompetent he was at managing the finances, so he tried to cover that up. Who the hell knows what really happened or why. He probably doesn't even know at this point, he can't keep his lies or stories straight.

Mark himself could say the coins are all gone and these people still wouldn't believe it.

The only thing I can imagine is the coins were moved there to sell and get to fiat. I have a hard time believing Bitstamp was in on this heist.

Very possible.

I agree and understand. I'm saying he probably didn't see it that way, if someone had stolen the coins he at least can try to paint himself as a victim as well as the customers. Obviously the customers won't see him that way but he probably figured it is worth a shot

Either way is a massive failure. How either of these things happen is beyond me but hopefully we learn the truth and all of the details the community wants to know.

Pretty sure he was joking

Same. I'm not subscribed but I occasionally check in to check the top stories and make an opinion on them.

My thinking that that the "thieves" deposited the stolen coins to a Bitstamp account in order to liquidate the coins and get out while they still can.  Once the coins reached that address, they were added to Bitstamp overall storage and the total credited to the users account. So it is possible that Bitstamp does have the coins but if the user has cashed out some of them the loss will be at Bitstamp's hands which they can't be held responsible.
If the coins haven't been sold yet then they could freeze said account and more than likely return them to gox. 
I am on mobile so it is hard for me to elaborate. I am not claiming in any way this is correct, just giving a possibility.

That's hardly the same as being able to send them the Bitcoin directly. I don't see using bitpay in that way as paying in bitcoin. Do you make a credit card transaction with a third party who then pays Amazon? No, Amazon accepts your card directly.

With all this "DAE just HODL :D" bullshit it feels like high school.

They can and will close accounts for no reason and with no explanation. They let you withdraw coins, obviously, but do not explain why they're closing you out. So have a backup plan in place to convert back to Fiat if you desire.
