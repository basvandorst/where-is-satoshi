My mom hodls but she's also taken far more money than me by accidentally selling a stack of ETH at ATH in 2012 so she could spay/neuter some kittens I sorta pushed on her :(

Because Bitcoin and other crypto assets are HIGHLY speculative, much like penny stocks and other emerging markets during early price discovery? 
But seriously though, there are no dumb questions just dumb people.

Haha I see you're a true believer in trickle-down economics. 
Trust the only thing trickling down is the Republican urine on your head.

Didn't see you mention Corporate Welfare in there anywhere. "Keep the fighting over crumbs and they wont realize you stole the whole cake."
Keep enjoying your small slice, bud.

Exactly. Even the KYC process with Coinbase, for example can take FOREVER for some people, so it's highly likely the accredited investor products like Bakkt, etc. see much more scrutiny.

Poor analogy, Linux is all over the place in 2019... eg. Chomebooks, Kindle, SteamOS, etc. 
If anything, in the case of Linux it's the monopolies that have embraced it.

Gold is shit as money. Can't spend it anywhere and it's too heavy. Great as a speculation asset but as money it is garbage.
Instead of downvoting me, counter my argument. Tell me why gold is better money??
My point: Bitcoin is not ready to be money yet (especially not 'better' money) and only shills and morons (like you) claim it to be.
Price discovery, general public usage/custodial solutions, micro transactions, etc... all of these are works-in-progress.

Yeah me too. Ultimately you have to have a decent understanding of a few different facets of the World: the history of banks/fiat currencies, finance, monetary policy, central banking, cryptography, exchange set commodity values, computer science/code devs, etc. Theres a certain amount of pre-requisite knowledge that one must have in order to full understand why Bitcoin is important and it's hard to pack that into a few moments of general dialogue without being all over the place and sounding crazy. He did a good job at hitting on some key points while speaking at a level his audience could understand.
