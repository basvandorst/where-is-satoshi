When you grow up, you'll learn to embrace people challenging your beliefs, because it makes you question them, and will make you come out stronger. Also, perhaps you'll learn some manners. For now, just shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:36
Maybe cook some dinner and set up a bed for the buyer while waiting for the confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:00:15
You mean stuff like: "Buy now. It can only go up?"
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:00:23
No one knows. Good luck.

Whatever, anyone tooting Bitcoin's horn gets praise in our cult.

Maybe you should read it before commenting.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:53:13
Anyone saying Bitcoin goes to the moon is 'spot on', anyone saying Bitcoin is overvalued because it's broken 'doesn't know shit about Bitcoin'. It's always the same in this cult. Doesn't matter who's the dumbass claiming it goes to a million, you'll worship him anyway.

Maybe they, just like me, think LN is nothing but hot air. It either won't work because it's the most backwards idea in the history of Bitcoin, or it will result in centralization/intermediaries which they do touch on. You nor I know though because it's all just theory up to this point.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:34:27
And they *SHOULD*. It's absolutely unjustifiable. I can certainly get behind the philosophy of Bitcoin, but not for this price.

Sick burn, brah.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:18:39
Has the opposite effect for me, to be honest. The ideology behind Bitcoin is great, but Bitcoin is the most inefficient payment system anyone could have come up with and with the advent of much more sophisticated distributed consensus algorithms, just simply redundant at this point. For example, look at  Same same, but a thousand times better. Blind faith in Bitcoin will be the HODLer's downfall.

Like I said, I don't care one way or the other. I'd be happy if both energy wasting shitcoins would disappear. [There are much better solutions to the problems Bitcoin is trying to solve.]( 
Apart from that though, LN isn't and never was a privacy solution, it's a solution to try and make sure you can *actually use it* the way it was intended to be used.

BTC cannot be just a store of value. Gold is not just a store of value. Gold is a store of value because people are going to want to buy your gold in the future, [because it has great utility.]( If this whole 'electronic cash' thing doesn't work out, it won't be a store of value.

Thus, high fees are a result of lots of transactions. (And high volatility causes more transactions.) Amount of transactions is a fraction of the amount of transactions if it was used for what it was invented for. Imagine the fees in that hypothetical world.

I want what you're smoking.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:26:06
That's part of it for sure, but unfortunately for Bitcoin, not the whole story.
Because gold actually *is* useful. To begin with; it actually is something. That means you can touch it, look at it, and use it. And it isn't just anything, it's a pretty rare, inert metal. That means it doesn't corrode. That makes it a very literal store of value because you can actually store it and be confident that a hundred years from now it will be just like you left it. This property makes it useful in many technological applications as well. That's already a pretty good case for gold.
But most of all, of course, it's beautiful. Being beautiful is very useful for gold because people want to have pretty things. They've been wanting pretty things for the past thousand years so you can be pretty confident they'll want pretty things for at least the next fifty years.
That is what makes gold a good store of value. Some number in a database has none of that.

I don't care one way or the other, but according to the other side, you are the ones who have succumbed to the spell of AXA/Blockstream/Core/Whatever and their corporate interest. 
Personally, at this point, I think all blockchain currencies are silly. It's just funny that for the libertarian ideals that you guys so often preach, you're so quick to call people out for not playing by your rules. What's especially funny is that you are now, if I understand you correctly, preaching *against* the transparency of the blockchain, while that was the whole point of it... But I can't really blame you. At this point, no one knows what the hell it is supposed to be anymore.

No, they're saying that anyone can create a crypto coin that is better than Bitcoin at what it is supposed to be doing (which is true and already happening), which can break Bitcoin's dominance. There are only 21 million Bitcoins, but there's an unlimited amount of cryptos. They make a pretty clear analogy with gold as well. Honestly, it really isn't hard to grasp what they're saying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:31
Listen, kids. Don't be like papa. Don't be naive. Stay critical. I drowned myself in Kool-Aid and hodl'd all the way to zero. They promised me golden mountains, but all I got was a bag. The writing was on the wall, but I chose to close my eyes. Oh, what a fool I was. Don't be like papa... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:49:16
I think Bitcoin - and other blockchain currencies - are broken at the core. There's no solving that. I think there are wholly different, and much better, approaches to the same problem Bitcoin is trying to solve (see the link I posted in my other comment.) And I have no faith in LN whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:30:38

Because Bitcoin is broken at the core. It's the most inefficient, wasteful payment system anyone could have come up with. It doesn't work and it will never work on any significant scale. There are much better solutions to distributed consensus than blockchains. Move away from echo chambers like and see for yourself.

@_date: 2017-08-26 22:21:47
Bitcoin as a currency will always be unusable and it's slowly but surely becoming the beast it tried to fight. Apart from a get-rich-quick-method, it's useless, valueless and meritless. It's not a resource, it's not guaranteed, it's a number in an energy-devouring database. There will still be some short term profits to be made, but long term this just can't and won't work, as is becoming increasingly evident.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:13:51

Your comparison is flawed. Try again.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:38:44

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:08:19
Why would I need cash in any of those things? (Apart from the stripclub, obviously.) And how is that the banks' fault? They provide you with an extra service, don't they? They don't have to put an ATM in a fucking Chinese restaurant. (Wtf?) Also, you don't have to put your money in the bank, didn't you know? So, in the end... What the fuck is the point of this bullshit post?

@_date: 2017-11-28 14:44:27
That would be amazing if you couldn't have bought it cheaper and faster any other way. BTC is a great investment (as of this time), but it's an inferior payment method to almost all alternatives.

And why would you post this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:12:24

This forum consists mostly of hopelessly naive, anarchistic, conspiracy-minded individuals who think everyone is out to get them. However, at the same time, they expect shit to 'just work' by the magic of the market if we remove banks, governments, and international cooperation. What can you say... Bitcoin isn't a bad idea, it's the followers that are the problem.
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:58:19
Many more dollars in existence is a consequence of economic prosperity and a consequence of cost-push and demand-pull inflation and an attempt by Central Banks to stabilize the economy. Central Banks don't just print money willyninnily. When my grandpa could buy a coke for a nickel, he didn't make what he would make today.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:55:34
Because it's not better, and this whole 'fuck fiat' mentally is retarded and childish, and frankly, speaks volumes about your understanding of the economy. Bitcoin is as much fiat as a dollar or euro is, but without the backing and regulation of governments. A regulated economy is a GOOD thing. It's part of the reason we're all, on average, much better off than we were before. And no, inflation does not happen because 'banks can just print money'. Adding or subtracting money to/from the pool is a way of regulating an economy, and to keep inflation/deflation in check. It happens as a response to inflation/deflation, NOT the other way around.

Why would the average person give a shit? Anyway, the comparison to the music, film and retail industry is ridiculous. They were all made much more convenient by going digital and thus the digital services flourished. Money has been digital for ages and, if anything, Bitcoin is a lot *less* convenient.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:26:31
Because either you have a system that works but consumes an ungodly amount of resources, or you have a system that doesn't work. Both are less than desirable and unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:54:37
More convenience is already happening. If I want to send someone money, I take out my phone, put in the amount and account number, use the fingerprint scanner on my phone to validate and done. I can also pay with my phone at the supermarket on the same machine that takes my debit card. It's already convenient. We don't need Bitcoin for that.
And regarding inflation; like I said, we have a system in place that monitors and tries to control inflation/deflation through monetary and fiscal policies, so indeed, it's not all natural. What is natural is market pressures, and the need to control and contain their influence on the economy. These fiscal and monetary policies happen *in response* to the natural inflation or deflation that is happening all the time in the 'real' world of goods and services. In fact, currently, central banks are worried because [they are *not* hitting their 2% inflation targets!](

Inflation and deflation are natural consequences of market pressures. If goods or services are in high demand, or low supply, their value goes up. If goods or services are in low demand, or high supply, their value goes down. This is inflation and deflation. What currency you use to conduct these exchanges of value is irrelevant. We have a central banking system that aims to control these market pressures, and one you can agree or disagree with, but money losing or gaining value always happens; Bitcoins, dollars, or euros.
There is more privacy in the current system than there is in Bitcoin. The point of Bitcoin is to be transparent, not private. Quite the opposite of private.
Monetary freedom is sufficient for most people in the Western world, and as is the case with the revolution in the entertainment and shopping industry, it's convenience that matters most, not freedom.

I know inflation is like the devil around these parts, but what exactly is the big problem? Yes, money you saved ten years ago is worth less now than it was back then. However, the vast majority of people do not earn enough money to have such long term savings that inflation is detrimental to. Apart from that, inflation and deflation happens in economies regardless without touching the money supply at all. Increasing or decreasing the money supply is a sensible policy if it happens as a response to economic activity, which is the aim of Central Banks. They're not here to rob you of your money and don't just print money without reason.
The most simple example, of course, is that the vast majority of people certainly don't earn enough money to buy houses, cars, and whatever else you need in order to facilitate making a living up front, so credit is necessary. The same goes for startups and small businesses.
Also, credit and debt are tools for conducting business at a distance or along a timeline. If you don’t have either one, you must conduct business entirely in the here-and-now, and that is extremely limiting.
Of course, a credit- and debt-free economy is certainly possible, if you want to go back to the stone age.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:59:32

That's a never ending argument, but your answer is NO regulation? Regulation is hard. Regulation is far from perfect. But NO regulation is MUCH worse. You are at the mercy of the market makers, much more than you will be in a regulated market. If you think all governments and central banks are trying their hardest to squeeze you out, that might be preferable, but I don't (and it's a silly notion.) Is it perfect? Never. Is it preferable? Definitely.

@_date: 2017-09-13 13:16:29
And see, this is the fatal flaw in Bitcoin reasoning. Inflation is when there is LESS supply than demand, so prices for goods and services rise. Inflation is NOT caused by the printing of money. Printing of money or taking money out of the pool (by increasing interest rates) is a response to inflation and deflation to try and control it, not the other way around. (Whether that is the best way, is another discussion.) You boys need to brush up on your Economics, and ignore the Bitcoin Choir Preachers for a bit. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:58:44
Nothing natural about this supply and demand cycle. Everyone is being played by the market makers.

True, bad wording on my part. Nominally prices go down, but as unemployment increases and wages decrease, for the majority of people it amounts to a *decrease of purchasing power*. (Effectively a 'real price' increase.)

So how would the average person buy a house? Start a business? I'm a small business owner. I needed credit to get started. I've since paid off all my debts and have a business chugging along nicely, but I couldn't have done it without that initial investment (and an awesome wife, which lend me 'credit' as well, as she was the one paying the bills at the time.) I bought a house about a month ago as well. I was lucky to be able to pay half up front with the money I made with my business, but I needed a mortgage for the other half. Credit has been great to me, as I would have been a wage slave without it.

Central Banks are semi-independent for exactly this reason, to try to keep monetary policy and politics separated as much as possible and to ensure no one stands to gain from it, except society as a whole. As I said, it's not perfect, and in constant need of review and revisions. But nothing is. Democracy isn't perfect. Governments aren't perfect. Police forces aren't perfect. Socialized healthcare isn't perfect. Etc. No power structure is perfect. But I've been on this earth long enough to know that anarchy, or leaving things into the hands of the common folk, is much worse. Examples a plenty throughout history. You have to be awfully naive to believe otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:38:23
Just a bit less mainstream than the Asurion Luggage Protection Plan.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:45:11
The ability for banks to lend credit is heavily monitored by Central Banks, which try to ensure that their credit supply is connected to economic activity. Nothing is ever perfect, but the notion that Central Banks are trying to rob you of your value through printing money willynillily is not the case. The money they add (or subtract) from the economy represents value.
Things would just be much more affordable... by what mechanism exactly? The value of things is determined by their demand and material/labour costs. Sure, cars were just 300 dollars in 1910, but my gramps only earned about 10 cents a day. The number of dollars is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:51:59

No, that is disinflation. Deflation is negative inflation.
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:11:52
Uh... what? Supply and demand of goods and services has *everything* to do with the value of money. The value of whatever money you have is its purchasing power. If you can buy a loaf of bread for a dollar, and the next day that loaf of bread is 2 dollars because the bakery caught fire, *your money lost value*. Such things (bakeries catching fire) and other things that influence the value of goods and services are constantly happening in an economy, thus influencing the value of money.
This is Page 1 of Economy 101. *This* is inflation/deflation.

They're perfectly valid arguments and your comparison is flawed. But we can disagree on that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:53:22
Because as long as everyone keeps saying it's a legitimate currency, and thus something that facilitates easy value transfer, it's a valid comparison. And if it's just a store of value, the energy requirements are even harder to explain.
