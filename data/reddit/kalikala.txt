Im probably missing something, but theres gotta be away to use bitcoin without the internet we know, but some other peer2peer yet to be made solution

Thanks for explaining it, that sheds a lot of light. OSI ISO.. i saw elizabeth stark explaining it in this vid  she basically said that we are in this period of rebuilding the internet to what it couldve become had we not gone down the path of walled gardens.

Anyway it won't be long before they're using it and don't even know it. Although if I mention that, they might get offended or something lol

What you're seeing is an effect of an architectural flaw in our outdated economic system. Soon, all they will need is a mobile phone and they'll be connected to the trillion dollar bitcoin network.

Really hope this is just a guy trolling

i don't know i thought it could all be done with nodes on a network? wouldn't the second and third layers of lightning be able to scalably connect every node to make up a new internet of its own? unless that would be another subject like mesh nets? I would love to get a developers take on this

So in order to faciliate all these protocols, do we really need these massive telecom companies?

What killed any credibility this article had were the fking plugs for this guys book they were pushing. When are people going to finally realize people get a bad taste in their mouths with shameless advertising? Even though I've heard this same info from other sources... Peter schiff talks about it

It was all open source code. If he didn't do, it someone else would've.

I feel like it doesn't Matter who he is.. Bitcoin wouldnt have had the impact it did if it wasn't a game changing invention. the "proof is in the pudding" and that's all I need. In a world where everyone wants to have their claim to fame, this person didn't want any credit cause they knew this invention was a force for radical change......
That's what's needed. More people like that to put out more technologies that empower the masses and shake up the status quo.

Had never heard about this Flextrans till now. This is more than likely what he'll be pushing, i have a feeling. I wonder, since flextrans allows lightning network, are there different things that can be built with segwit that flextrans just can't support? I'm talking higher layers, 3rd, 4th...
It seems like flextrans could be almost exlusively for payments where as segwit will allow more than just a payment solution, but further down the road applications? I could be wrong here. I need to look into what segwit offers further down the road, that flextrans doesn't.

Do you know the news (if any) on why the price is going up?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:24:08
theres a difference between changing your mind because you looked into the facts, and changing your mind because your chasing a buck. before 2017 he called bitcoin every name in the book and knew nothing of the technology. now this year hes seeing dollar signs. the guy is a another douche bag jock who happens to have a billion dollars.

dont sell. i once had 20 bitcoin i bought in 2013. sold all in 2014 :( DO. NOT. SELL.

He doesnt belong in bitcoin. his type was the reason bitcoin was made!

I'm all for btc and find it as exciting as the next but this video also reminds me that just like fiat, Bitcoin is another abstraction that we all decide has value. 
I believe that Btc is the next step in what will eventually be the end of money all together. We'll eventually come to the realization that we don't need silly ideas like money to get do the things we want to do, and incentive could be created through different means. We'll find a way to program ourselves into a truly decentralized world, all through a distributed blockchain network

What exactly is he describing here? is it a second layer solution? So i read section 8 and it said not everyone has to run nodes. Does that have something to do with bitcoins scaling solution today? not quite sure

its saying that for me too very annoying. i'd also like to know of any other good ones

The very little bitcoin I bought this year (sold so much 3 years ago, absolutely kicking myself), I never spend. What you express is a common human emotion with bitcoin. That very feeling to me validates how very wrong the bitcoin cash movement is. Satoshi's vision has already come to fruition in the form of this very open source space. There were already payment solutions out there before BCH. Allow bitcoin to be a store of value and rising asset class. Either ways higher level layers will later take care of payments aspect of it.

nothing about it. when coins go up, people wanna know what the news is
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:40:54
why is bitcoin going up? is the fork still happening? i heard there was only a 60% chance now that a big mining pool stopped signaling for 2x
