His lawyer made those comments, not the judge or prosecution.
What the fuck are you people jerking about over here?

We have a fragmented securities market.  There was no interruption in volume today.  We do not need a decentralized stock exchange.  We need more financial literacy and less buzzwords such as decentralized.

No volume interruption today.  [The stock exchange is like the honey bagder. Very resilient](

No.  I act like the guy inferred that the economy was the reason he had financial problems.  Make all the judgement you want, but I'm just saying his selling point is bullshit and anyone buying it is an idiot.

Oh so you're not a crazy person going through old reddit comments?  Fine we can have a little private discussion here.  
This is a recent comment on Fold.  Shits ridiculous.  No one offers that type of discount using legitimate methods.  No one.  
Maybe a company will offer a deal on their own cards.  That's not what I'm saying.  It's just not possible to get these quanity of cards without fraud.  No way there is enough of a supply of discount Costco cards for someone to sell them and still make a profit.
Remember if you are selling a starbucks card for a 20% discount, you have to make a profit. 
And let us, you and I, reflect on this 3 month old thread where I was accused of being a buttcoin shill because I had posted there and my new account was less than a month old.  
This place is toxic and if you deny that a 20% discount to the worlds most popular companies doesn't come from fraud than we really don't have much to talk about.  This shit is scammy plain and simple.

You are 100% correct. The fdic functions to close down banks in an orderly fashion if they go bankrupt and to collect fees from the banks they cover to ensure a fairly large reserve fund is available if needed. 
But the federal government would have to step in if the fdic ran out of money. And from what I've read it would take over in that scenario. That's the feeling I got from Sheila Bair's biography.

You really going through 3 month old comments?
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:29:35
Honestly, I don't believe that at all.  
I can't find anyone else that sells 20% discounted starbucks cards online.  I don't see how this business model works or is sustainable.  
The only way I see this working is through fraud.  There just isn't enough people out there willing to sell you a starbucks gift card at enough of a discount for you to sell them for 20% under retail.
Don't care, but when you're eventually shut down I won't be shocked.  
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:58:19
Oh so it's fraud.

I'm a little confused here.  I'm pretty sure the credit card system does not work that way.  You don't get charged for "trying".  Am I mistaken?

and then 


That's no problem?  That seems like a huge hassle.  I don't get it.

Is there a Canadian BTC merchant market I'm missing?  
I'm a long time Toronto resident and have never even seen a "Bitcoin accepted here" sign.  
This [Canadian bitcoin website]( which is terrible and hard to navigate, lists 50 businesses in Toronto that accept bitcoin.
When you search Toronto in the keywords 15 businesses show up.  I just selected one of them randomly, [Airport Limousine]( to see if they accept bitcoin.  I called the number listed on their website.  I asked if they accept bitcoin as payment and the response I got was "credit cards?".  No I said, bitcoin.  He told me to hold.  After 30 seconds he came back to say they did not accept bitcoin (I swear to god this happened about 5 minutes ago).
From everything I've seen there isn't one retail merchant success story with bitcoin.  Am I mistaken?  Is there some vibrant Canadian merchant market I've just missed?
EDIT WITH WHAT I'VE FOUND SINCE THEN -
- Zinzan studios didn't answer the phone.  No BTC mention on their website, but I have no reason to doubt they accept it.  Not retail obviously
- Called the Morpheus clinic for hypnosis.  Asked if they accept BTC. To quote, "We do!  No one has actually paid with it though".  I politely informed her I was doing research and to not expect someone paying in BTC soon.  
- Calling Supernova performance tech. Got an automated system.  I don't care enough about this shit to go through that hell.  I typed the extension for the only person listed on their website.  Got a voicemail.  No mention of BTC on their website and this site has a search function.  I'd bet they don't accept it, but that's just me guessing.  
- [Is this even a business?](
- Smoke Bourbon BBQ House is heavily advertised to accept BTC.  [They were on TV]( when bitcoin was hot in Jan 2014.   They have not mentioned BTC on twitter since then.  [The only updated info I could find was this thread from about 2 months ago]( saying they were not accepting BTC.  2 calls to them went unanswered. I was kinda interested in this one.
So my question stands even louder now - what Canadian BTC merchant market?
