I had kind of assumed that this was a typo, and they meant Fall 2015 -- and that the response on Twitter was them making a joke about their mistake. From EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON's reaction though, and the fact that it isn't fixed yet on their front page, I am starting to wonder if they are being serious?
It just doesn't make *any* logical sense for them to say that and be serious though, so I'm sticking with the assumption that it's just a joke that went over the collective Internet community's head...

Yeah, I just don't know if BTC is going to be the way to go long term for transactional stuff. It's first gen tech, and while that means adoption is high, there's a lot of things we've learned that make me think we'd be better off with more than one currency for different purposes. DAG coins for example (not naming any because this community gets super toxic at any hint of "shilling") are ridiculously good for transactional stuff, while BTC might be a good stable value-store. Or, maybe tech that we haven't seen yet will make the be-all/end-all coin in the future. It's also totally possible that BTC could get more features that we need in time, as it is definitely evolving, but there's base architectural decisions that just won't change. I'm really not sure. For now I've given up trying to push friends to try using it, because if the experience can be this frustrating for me (a crypto evangelist) then having them try too early would be a good way to put them off crypto for a really long time. I'll recommend daily transactions when I think it's REALLY ready... Hopefully that can be soon. ��

Yeah, I'm pretty sure this was one of the ones I went to (I visited two, a couple years apart, this one about a month ago). I pretty much just felt sad the whole time I was there. The other one (in Akiba) was big on "rescue and rehabilitation" and was really strict about letting the owls have breaks and rest, but this one (in Harajuku) just seemed a bit exploitative. Not a reflection on OP, I went there too after all, and actually had a similar reaction to this owl's name. :D
~~Thought I had a pic of him too, but couldn't find it.~~ [Found it.](
Edit: actually looking back at my pics, I had them reversed! This one was great.

[Found it.]( I actually remembered him from my first visit in 2015.
This was the good one in Akiba! So, feel a bit better, this owl is probably feeling fine. :)

Err, as I said in another reply, that is patently false. Less than a year ago they were forcing people (including myself) to wait for multiple confirmations.

Is he still with his friend Register? ��

[BitFlyer refund initial email](
@_date: 2019-04-07 16:51:15
Interesting -- they must have changed their policy within the last year. Just under a year ago I tried to pay with BTC at BIC and it was a nightmare. The transaction was broadcast, but they needed to wait for the BitFlyer app (on their side, I use a different wallet) to give them a thumbs up or something, which I think they said was a double confirmation? Anyway, I stood there for about 15 minutes until their app got an error and said "failed". They then told me to pay a different way. Except... No thanks, I already sent the money! Getting them to understand that was difficult (my Japanese is not great but I had a Japanese friend there to help explain, kinda) but they eventually seemed to understand (I don't think the staff really gets how crypto works) and called their support number for BitFlyer. They then walked through some stuff on their machine, I repeated a bunch of things for the 5th or so time, and they said they'd send me an email to start a refund process. At this point I had been standing around for about an hour trying to buy this stupid thing and just paid with a credit card so I could get the heck out of there. The refund process took THREE MONTHS before I finally got the BTC returned to a wallet I control in the original amount. I had just about given up on ever seeing it as they would sometimes ask a question, go for weeks without responding to me, and then ask for clarification that was already in my original response. That was the point when I gave up trying to use BTC as an actual transactional currency any time soon. I'm glad to hear they have changed things up a bit, but as some other people have said, this seems a little sketchy too and open to exploitation. Once people do start exploiting it, it isn't going to be good for adoption, I can say that much for sure...

Mine took two weeks as well, but it doesn't matter, because there's no point being registered on MtGox... Such a horrible platform. :/
Wish I'd realized that before I even bothered signing up and sending them all my info.

Yeah, 15" 2013 MBP, that's my work laptop but it lives there when I bring it home over weekends. The table is from Walmart. Otherwise, even the door is in the right freaking place. Webcam too. Also, I *did not* change what was on the monitors for this picture... Those are literally the charts I've had up all day. I just about fell out of my chair when I saw your pic. &gt;_&lt;
PC is an i5-2500k and an ATI (or is it AMD now...) 6950. It's a year old or so now, but it's funny how much the inflation on PC specs has slowed down in the past few years, ever since things started being "more cores" instead of "faster cores".
Edit: looks like the only major difference is that my cat earned the privilege of having his bed and scratching post to the right of my desk, which pushed my printer into another room. :P

Yeah, happened to me too, really pissed me off... Was trying to buy at 400, put in a first test order, it went through, then was going to do my full order and BAM "You can only have one pending order" fffffuuuuuuuuuuu
So yeah, it's one of those frustrating things in life...

Hah, just noticed, we both drink Dr. Pepper 10. (See my post below, the can is behind the mouse.) :P
