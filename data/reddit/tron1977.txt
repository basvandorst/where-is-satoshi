I disagree, if it's only $20 a week, he won't miss it and that will be his learning experience.  I didn't know much about it 3 years ago when i started putting $20 a week in.  Now I have a LOT more "money" and I know a LOT more about cryprocurency.

I would buy $100 worth of bitcoin.  Buy the software and hold onto the other $50.  That way you''ll be safe from any fluctuations between when you buy the bitcoin and you buy the software.  And then in a few months when it hits $20k you can sell it and you got the software for free.

"Should I back it up? Nah, it's worth less than the time."
I get this.  I tried to buy some bitcoin when it was around 50 cents.  I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to do it.  Mt GOX was the only way I knew of and i couldn't figure out what I was doing.  So I thought this wasn't worth my time.
I don't feel too bad about it.  Because odds are I would have kept it in Mt GOX, and we know how that ended.

And to answer your first question.  The reason I would think about putting it on Circle is 
"Money in your Circle account is insured at no cost to you. We take every precaution to keep your money safe, but in the event that something unfortunate happens, we've got you covered."
@_date: 2014-09-25 16:50:49
All good points.  I have them in a wallet on my computer  (electrum).  But I feel like that's not the safest place as I feel I could easily fuck something up and loos them for good.
I have a coinbase account and have been think about just moving them there.  Today I got a Circle invite and was just looking for any info, good or bad about them.
Thanks for any input you have.  It's not like I have thousands of dollars to worry about.  I'm still relatively new to all this (about 6 months) and am still trying to learn the ins and out.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:56:04
ok, I'm still a bit now to all this.  I have my coins in an Electrum wallet on my PC.  How would I use this app to have access to that money and spend it?
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:25:15


I feel the same way.  It seems like there are too many ways that I could fuck things up and less ways Coinbase could fuck things up.

A question:
It says in a review:
At the current difficulty level, this unit will produce $8.00 per month in BTC. If difficulty doesn't rise (impossible) you will have to wait 37 months to break even. You probably will never get half your money back.
My question is:  Let's say bicoins increase in value 10 fold.  Does that mean it will mine $80 worth per month.  Or is the rate of mining based on it's value.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:30:19

This can't be an option with bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-01-28 21:46:54

@_date: 2015-01-14 17:56:44
I'm new to short selling, I checked out 
Am I doing this right?
Current price is 184
On the "margin trade" page:
I placed a limit sell at 180
then I place a stop buy order at 190
When the price drops to 180, what happens?  Then do I have to manually cancel the buy order at 190?
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:26:25

Then I signed something and sent my ID in.
I should be fine right?

So I can sell back my USDT to Tether at any time and get dollars from them out of their reserve? 
I don't believe that's how it works.  If it did, any time it dipped below $1 everyone could cash out and make easy money.

who promised you what?
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:19:32
I believe that is one of the things Mueller is investigating along with whether or not Trump colluded with the Russian government to influence the election (the Russian government DID try to influence the election, that's been proven and agreed upon on both sides).
I don't KNOW if he did or not.  I'm not part of the Mueller team.  But to say for sure either way is pretty stupid since you are basing it on nothing.  Mueller is basing it on evidence and the people who already plead guilty in exchange for giving him information.

Ok, i just looked at Trezor for a second.  I wanted to see what happens when you lose or something hapends to your Trezor.
in the recovery section it says:
What do you need to start your TREZOR recovery:
A new or wiped TREZOR
Your filled out TREZOR recovery card
A computer with the TREZOR bridge installed
ok, so say 5-10 years from now, something happens to it.  TRAZOR went out of business or something.  You cant get a "new or wiped TRAZOR".  And/or you cant get "TRAZOR bridge".
What happens then?

you only know what the all time high was in hindsight.  The drive from $4800 to $19,000 was all ATH.  So with your logic you would have sold around $5600 (when it leveled off for a few weeks) and have watched it go to $19,000

I've looked into escrow services and haven't really found any that people say are reputable.  BUT, if I was a seller I wouldn't want to use one.  He's just as likely to get ripped off as you are not using one.  If it's in escrow, it's not released until you say you received the merch.  You can easily lie and say you didn't get it.  Or at least make it a pain in the ass for him to get his bitcoin after you received you merch.

2) Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty in December to making false statements to the FBI.
3) Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and Manafort’s longtime junior business partner, was indicted on similar charges to Manafort. But in February he agreed to a plea deal with Mueller’s team, pleading guilty to just one false statements charge and one conspiracy charge.
4) Richard Pinedo: This California man pleaded guilty to an identity theft charge in connection with the Russian indictments, and has agreed to cooperate with Mueller.

So where are they?
I have over 2 bitcoin in Coinbase (lets not debate that here). since I've had them, there was a splits creating "bitcoin cash" "bitcoin gold" and soon "bitcoin 2x".
I'm pretty sure I've read that i will have access to my Bitcoin Cash in January on Coinbase. Is that right?
I just go an email that seems to say that I'll have access to my Bitcoin 2x right after the split. Is that correct?
But I've never heard anything about my Bitcoin Gold. So where is that? How and when can i have access to that.
When i do have access on Coinbase, how's that going to work? I'm my wallet will there be a list of all 4 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:45:12
- and is it easy to just add more coin to it as I accumulate more?

@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:35
I remember the Bitcoin Cash emails and I'm getting B2x emails.  I don't remember bitcoin Bold emails.  but I'm thinking I just got confused and equated the Bitcoin cash split with the bitcoin gold split.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:16:42

forgive the ignorance, but what exactly is a bitcoin ETF?  From what I understand, in the simplest terms, and ETF is similar in a way to a mutual fund, correct?  It's a "is a marketable security that tracks a stock index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets".
But Bitcoin is only one thing.  I would understand a Crypto ETF, where it is a fund of all different cryptos so that it diversifies your investment.  But if an ETF consists of just Bitcoin, how is it different then just buying bitcoin?

@_date: 2018-02-06 15:40:25
yes, I am aware, but that was the first one i found that can smooth the logarithmic graph down to a 200-period moving average.  Not saying by any means that its the only one that can, just that it was the first one I found)

I'm planning on going to his white paper study group
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:15:43
not going to hit escape velocity this way.
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:37:23
and I'm not entertained!  I'm poor now.
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:11:44
found him!
  he's a bitcoin genius -

@_date: 2015-03-25 22:35:43
Thanks!!!  You're awesome.  I will pay it forward.

I feel like since there is a finite amount of bitcoin,  if you do the math, over a long enough timeline it will all be lost.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:35:17
Yeah, up until now it's been all held at coinbase.  But now that it's starting to accrue I should start thinking about other options.
My problem is that I don't really trust myself not to screw up and lose it somehow. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:47:50
Hypothetically... if there was a way to know 100% that a coin is lost.  Would there be any way for anyone to put it back in circulation. (Again, hypothetically)
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:31:51
thats why I don't feel so bad when I first wanted to buy bitcoin (around $2-$3) but couldn't figure it out.  It's not like I would still have them.  Most likely they would have been in MtGox and now i would be thinking about how i lost few hundred thousand dollars.

I look forward to re-reading this thread in a year or two.
And then make fun of either the half of the people that said he's smart or the half of the people who said he's stupid.
I'm hoping that latter.

Dude, thanks.  this is why I'm here, this community is great.  It will be paid forward.
@_date: 2016-10-13 20:38:41
Yeah, that was Pied Piper's problem.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:23:12
AWESOME, thanks.  $5 got (2:22 EST)
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:39:21
Wouldn't that devalue the existing coin?
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:38:47
is this what your white paper group looks like?
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:22:20
unless of course Bitcoin tanks, then he's screwed.

Hypothetically, if he bought the house WITH his bitcoin, would he owe taxes on the capital gain?

The two times I contacted customer service they were very helpfull
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:22:09
been doing $20 a week since it was down around $150 (actually i started when it was around $600, but kept going as it hovered between $150-$200)
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:19:44
$1500... how quaint
@_date: 2015-02-04 06:02:54


Bitpay had a progress bar as to when the transaction will be complete
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:37:47
Bitcoin was under $3 when I first tried to buy it.  But i didn't understand how to do it at all, so I gave up.  I'd like to think I'd be pretty well off now if I did.  But in reality it probably would have all been in Mt Gox at the time and you know how that turned out.
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:28:45
OK, that's something.  But on a regulatory level, what makes it different?
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:07:52

Awesome... but... Lamborghini doors open up
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:59:31

How is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust different from an ETF?
