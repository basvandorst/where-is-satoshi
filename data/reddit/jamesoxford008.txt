Didn't California just pass legislation on the regulation or taxation of crypto? It seems like I saw something on this in the last week.  Maybe it has something to do with this.

There are calculators available that take into account all the fixed and variable costs. Saying "no its not profitable" is a bit like saying, "nobody goes there anymore, its too crowded."  You can't just plug in your desktop and expect to see a return.  The only way to see any return is using ASIC miners and they are power hungry.  They generally fix the cost of the miner about what you could reasonably expect to mine in something like a 10-12 month period, and in that time global hash rates will increase as well as the difficulty level.  The whole equation changes though if or when prices rise.  Basically, if I were going to mine, it wouldn't be for a return today and I'd be betting on prices to rise.  And it wouldn't take "millions" but definitely thousands; investment would depend on the scale of the operation.

You need to know whether or not words can repeat and you would want a count for the # of words of length y.  You also need some upper bounds on the number of words in the sequence, or preferably, to know the number of words in the sequence.

Okay, so technically as soon as "the network" has the transaction from A -&gt; B, B can broadcast the transaction B-&gt;C.  The first transaction won't propagate instantly, so there is going to be some servers that know about the A to B transaction and some that won't for some period. Is there any risk in broadcasting during this time?   
I guess the real question is what are the risks in broadcasting a transaction too early? I've used btc for a while now but I don't really know that much about how a transaction propagates the network and gets confirmed.
