This sounds fishy...
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:19:32
hmm.  seems to vary from person to person.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:43:49
lol no problem
@_date: 2013-08-01 23:14:38
I thought we already covered this...
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:38:11
when you log into mtgox your verification que is right on your home page.... at the top... highlight.... with a large number to it's right.  They go through about 1000 a day
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:27:35
Oh yea, that's more of what I mean; actually have gox show a balance on my account 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:07:42
you don't have to be verified to buy....
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:01:56
I'm new to bitcoin.  What's wrong with buying mtgox and then transferring to your wallet?  Or do you mean as far as consistent buying and/or selling?
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:34:34
that's actually not a bad idea... pool a group of about 1500 bit coins from different users and synchronize buying and selling based on utc time.  That would shift the market about $5 USD each time....

I served justice to Dwolla.  I started an account and attempted to link my bank account, they deposited $0.03 to verify the account, and I never verified! I still have it muahahahaha!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:50:41
articles are at different times, not real time.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:09:53
No, you can send them money without being verified.  It's only for large withdrawals do you need to be verified
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:55:41
Great! Have fun!

I sent a wire transfer from a us bank to gtmox right before the big crash from $270/btc, when they were experiencing all their problems.  I was worried too, but my account was credited with my wire transfer about 36hours after I sent it.

Their website only says trading is halted until 0200 UTC time, which has passed, which is why trading is now active.

I mean their time to receiving my funds in their bank to them actually crediting my gox account so that I may purchase bct.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:45:29
It just went through, which is actually pretty quick considering what they are going through.  So actual time was probably 33 hours.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:31:30
oh no not yet :P I was just clarifying my question of time from wire transfer to actually showing credit on gox :/  Hopefully soon though!
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:18:07
thank you.  mine's been going about 12 hours now and was wondering if deposits would be affected by today's fiasco 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:49:31
at work
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:23:50
Okay good, as long as the address and routing/account numbers were correct then you're probably fine, though that does seem kind of long.  Do as they say, and after 5 days, contact them if you still haven't received your deposit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:39:07
who did you use?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:28:30
Very true.  I suppose I wasn't clear enough.  I meant as far as gox showing credit in account.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:41:41
No, though large deposits (figuring anything 10k and over) into a US bank account will likely notify the IRS.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:05:35
still waiting on wire transfer to mtgox
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:14:25
You did follow all the directions, right?  Including putting your account number in the details of the transfer so they know which account to credit?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:29:35
I did an online wire transfer from US bank to their bank.  I'll let you know when my account gets credited on gox so you can get a better idea.
