Well, right, have my upvote then.

In this case it really is so easy. When you're setting it up for use with a hardware wallet, [the install wizard asks you about the key derivation path]( you'd like to use, prefilling it with the default one for pre-SegWit addresses.
It is here that you need to change 44 to 49. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:34:24
Nah, you're right. There are several ways to achieve plausible deniability.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:38:38
Well, if I ran a full node, I'd already be checking if there's any address with UTXOs of 10000 from 2010.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:33:05
It also works with Electrum, you just need to edit the key derivation path (change 44 to 49) as you set it up.

Could this have anything to do with the November hack? Of course it's not _those_ funds, they're [still frozen]( at the same wallet, but it's a very similar amount.
(Do they _want_ us to think it's related?)

CME futures expire on the last Friday of the month, at 4pm London time.
BTCF8 expired on **26 Jan** (as has already pointed out), BTCG8 will expire on **23 Feb**.

I know and agree that it was horrible. Have they stolen or lost anyone's funds?
All exchanges have issues, you need to weigh your preferences. When withdawals are forever pending on Poloniex I'm way more worried than I was when Kraken was down.

Shirley Manson sings _"I'm riding high upon a deep depression"_ in Garbage's 90s hit song Only Happy When It Rains. In your case it's basically the literal truth.
In all seriousness, sounds like you've overcome that, and that's great. Wish you the best!

If we were able to do that, that would be true decentralization! /s

No one said that the monster downtime was acceptable or that it's not okay to be mad at them for it. We are talking about shadiness, which I put in another box.
My fiat deposits and withdrawals (SEPA) always arrive next day with them. I request it in the afternoon, it's on my bank account the next morning at 11am.
I'll take the occasional outage (while hating it of course) over what OP described or how CEX operates ("will take 2-60 days" and you need to legally surrender your rights to complain).
Edit: clarifications.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:48:08
I think you need to start with [the basics of economy]( before even thinking about trading.
No, that page is not everything you need to know. It's just the very first step of a somewhat longer journey.

Their private key can be obtained by entering all the other stuff into a paper wallet generator. You're welcome.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:55:39
That has a lot of truth to it up until a point.
If there's hyperinflation, a commodity with a relatively stable value is very sought after. If you're looking to escape the place, having your wealth with you in a convertible form is very valuable, especially if they cannot take it from you, because you simply memorized how to generate a brain wallet using your cousin's name, the words of your tattoo and the ISBN of your favorite book, salted with your first email address.
It's easy to see how the deniability also helps a lot here. Of course to see the latter use case affect the local price, a sizeable share of the country must want to leave, but we've seen that before. Where I live they used to have a wall against it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:07:22
So, uh... where's the pendrive?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:48:41
Kraken might have (had) technical issues, but would you care to elaborate on how it's shady?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:45:57
OP was trying to deposit US dollars. There are no limits on that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:03
...and others who previously felt that they had missed the train are ready to enter. Just had a friend text me "okay, so today is the day to buy crypto, how do I do it?".
We're still at the beginning, not the end.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:33:01
That's not shady, such a delay doesn't hold any funds hostage. It's incompetent at best, but that was not the question.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:24:21
And that only if you know how the list was split and which half you've got.
Though most people would just split in the middle or use simple interleaving, strictly speaking there are 1,352,078 ways to split the list even if you don't touch the order within each half.  Each pattern requires two tries.

3am where I am, that's not the point. What I meant was that traders are pretty damn well distributed all over the world.

By that time adoption will either be global or there'll be no adoption at all. That means if Bitcoin won't cease to exist by then, the volume of transactions will be huge, and thus the cumulative fees will be supposed to make it profitable.

Tell me about it! My favorite ones are tahini and allioli (prepared the Catalonian way). I guess I'm somewhat of a purist, especially when it comes to.... wait, which subreddit is this?
Oh, right. Yes, so I love Christmas sales, too!

To be honest even with this correction it's +40% this month. Always view everything in context.

When this all ends, a *lot* of people will be yelling your username. Just wait for it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:32
In order to avoid misunderstandings it would probably be a good idea to mention at least your country of residence. Regulations differ _wildly_.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:54:51
Nah, that's exactly what Bitcoin is for. They use dollars to _consume_ them.

Well then in a similar fashion Kraken users can thank their flaming trainwreck of an exchange, too.
It usually takes 10 tries to submit an order, and that takes a lot of time, because you have to keep on checking your list of orders because *an error message doesn't necessarily mean that it didn't go through*, and it can just magically appear and fill *minutes later*.
Edit: clarifications.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:36
Depends on your legislation. Here in Germany all trades are taxable exactly like you're saying, unless you've held the coin you're selling for at least a year. What you're selling is determined on a "first-in, first-out" basis.
That said, YMMV.
Edit: I know you asked specifically for US laws. The main point here is that - idk - it could differ even from state to state. I'd also like to urge everybody to check all this for their own country/state of residence _before_ trading.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:52
Wish I had fiat on my account at the exchange... what a Christmas sale!

Two sheets. One with the private key encoded using AES, another one with the encryption key. Done in two different countries. Bolted together face to face at home, bolts marked with some homegrown tamper-evident seal.

Never said it wasn't, also the business in question flourishes in both.

Right, triggered != caused. There's some overlap, and we can argue about that, but equal they are not.

Though we need a Bitcoin Help Fund Help Fund to raise them some money for a Segwit wallet.

It's multiple addresses, and it's basically not much more than a guess that they belong to the same entity, AFAIR.
[The address that mined the genesis block]( holds 66.7 BTC for example.

Assisted HODL.
Anyway, why would it be in their interest to skip on a large volume of trade, and with that, fees? They could just put a pause on withdrawals if they lacked the liquidity.

No, because it's a favorable environment for this enterprise. Also, being a British Overseas Territory grants it stability.

Either they do have the money (would not be unusual for corporate accounts), or - and that's way worse - this is a partly or entirely fake order put in as a manipulation by someone affiliated with the exchange.
I can't really imagine the latter at GDAX, though.
It's also possible that there is a large number of legit orders _and_ a bid wall at that price.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:49:52

So you're saying it's possible to sell without someone buying it? Interesting idea.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:39:39
It still doesn't, solely because I didn't short.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:26:23
It's a _bid wall_, there's no buying intention behind it. In fact, the one who put it up wants to _sell_. They want impatient buyers to put bids _above_ it, which enables them to sell for a better price to these people.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:32:36
The dotcom bubble _did_ occur, and it's a great parallel. It was about everyone blindly investing in any company that had something internet-related in its name. That's the analogue of all the shitcoins on Yobit and all the ICOs of companies that "tokenize" everything in a "revolutionary" way. 
And [this here]( is the analogue of Bitcoin. Sure, not everybody and their dog knew that Bezos' company was here to stay, but it was evident to everyone who'd done their homework.
The tulips comparison, on the other hand, is utter BS.
Edit: typo fix.

The maths done by the website includes the unconfirmed transaction in the middle, although it never made it to a block and never will. The real balance is 0.

Kraken works wonderfully from Germany, and their bank account happens to be German, it's at Fidor Bank AG. Deposits/withdraways use SEPA, obviously.
It's fast, too.

Just keep mining! Until you don't sell, you don't have to pay the $3000!

It's your total transaction volume. Whether you made gains, broke even or even lost, you traded this amount of money.
Of course you only pay taxes for any gains.
