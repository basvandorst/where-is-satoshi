Implying that the idea of investing in BTC is a stupid gamble that only someone in Vegas would do

Hi Gavin. Can we create maximum hash power for pools? 
"We" ? If you are asking for permission, sure, go ahead, patches welcome. If you are asking if I know how to do this; no.

Two marks though, as opposed to one mark (an apostrophe)

Are people seriously surprised? I can't be the only one who finds this unimpressive

Yes and no. It is in the sense that it has value assigned to it, but it isn't in that it is not widely accepted. As BTC grows, it will become a currency just like the Euro or USD. Any item could be used as a currency if a wide group of people agree to assign a value to it. I could say that I am going to begin using mailboxes as currency, and if those mailboxes were given value and used to exchange goods just as the Euro, USD, and BTC are, the mailboxes would be a currency.
