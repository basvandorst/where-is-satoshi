Buy now, pay later.
If it's accepted at participating retailers, and your Coinbase BTC denominated credit limit fluctuates with market prices, what do you have to lose from having an additional $20 to your name accepted by Coinbase merchants?
- It's quicker and easier than rebuying BTC after you spend
- It's quicker and cheaper than paying a fee to spend BTC on-chain, which may involve digging into cold storage
- You don't have to worry about any capital gains or losses
- You can spend money you don't have
- Zero privacy, obviously but your privacy would be slashed by default just by paying BTC on-chain to a Coinbase wallet at Coinbase merchants. In the best possible case, you could pay for online goods without giving your identity or shipping address, but for plenty of Coinbase merchant goods and services, your personally identifiable info is needed, and you are deanonymized regardless of how well your coins are mixed.
You get the ability to spend $20 more purchasing power you don't currently have, and just pay the bill at the end of the month. The bigger the credit limit, the more attractive is this offer. A big BTC only credit limit, and incentives to pay with BTC at participating merchants could very well turn the tables on adoption, just by giving people what they want.
Have you ever received a letter offering you free credit from a credit card company? Free money in the mail would probably spur Bitcoin adoption better than anything else, and worst case scenario it will produce a measurable and quantifiable ROI even if deeply in the red, which I don't foresee as being likely since Coinbase users have to verify banking details.
With Coinbase or BitPay and their thousands of merchants already accepting BTC, they could just as easily directly advertise free credit offers to the public, and allow merchants to opt in to accepting the credit card payments.
