Me too, which is why I was asking for opinions. I'm just starting to look at wedges and flags and things. Wedge is a trading channel that is narrowing, so once price breaks north of the resistance line, like it did above, there is a buying opportunity because it will likely go higher somewhat at that point. But then you set a stop loss back inside the wedge on the unlikely chance it breaks back down into the wedge soon.

It turned out to be a good buying opp, but whether that was by skill or luck I'm not sure.

I want to feel the same way, but I worry it will never get mainstream investment because the distribution is fundamentally unstable. Too many people have the nuclear code and could tank it at the drop of a hat, anytime at all.  For example. if it reaches $100,000 value in 2025 (total random example) and someone decides to cash out on 50,000 BTC and make $5 billion they'll probably tank the price by double digit percent. And then it can spiral out of control from there.  There is no solution to this problem, is there? Too many whales can just hodl their giant long term positions and cash out any time. I want to believe in BTC... does anyone have any thoughts about this problem?

True but I don’t see it as a complete waste of time. Better to try to learn all the TA even if some things are very hard to use. I assume in learning all this stuff you must get some intangible understandings or insights.

Thanks.. but I was thinking: it doesn't matter whether a whale no longer NEEDS to cash out. The problem is simply that they COULD if they wanted to. Even if they don't ever do it. Just that possibility could prove to be a big problem long term. I wonder how big an issue this is in the eyes of institutional investors.

What have you used as an onramp in the past instead of CB? Just curious.
