As I did not find a "price" post on the hot topics... What do you think? As of now, it's stable  Do you think it will dip a little more before 1/aug, or should I buy now to hold and sell after it goes up with all this bcc bullshit?

Someone told me that I should: 1) Wait for the fork to happen. 2) Move my BTC from paper wallet 1 to another address (paper wallet 2, for example). 3) Use a BCH wallet to move the BCH.
If you do it in this order, I agree that the BTC is safe. Does anyone disagree?

Is there a community-verified BCC wallet? :/

Post your bitcoin address here. I take your word for it, and I can spare a few bits!

Just a quick question: If the coins split into BTC and BCC (BitcoinABC), will my BTC and BCC public and private keys be the same?
So... If I use a BCC wallet withouth knowing the source code, do I risk leaking my private key?
Is anyone concerned about this, or am I tripping balls?

Completely changed my strategy based on this ^

Stopped using It and started using coinomi.

Forget wallets and seeds. I have the keys, public and private. You can just import it, or sweep it. Either way, what I am afraid of is using an "official" bitcoinabc/bitcoincash wallet, and it ending up being a scam to steal my pvt key (that is the same on the bitcoin network)...
Will definitely not be using the official wallet, will stick to something known like electrum or another one...

1) Trust your next of kin (wife, kids, parents, etc)
2) Give them a bip-38 encripted paper wallet
3) Make sure they have the password that decodes it, along with other passwords they might need (email, etc)
4) Print instructions on how to use it
5) be clear that they should only use it in case you die.

I think there's an ElectrumCash one, but be careful if you are using Electrum on the same machine (see posts about this today on
