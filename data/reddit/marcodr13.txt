I fully agree with you. The only "100% real" cash is M0 (or maybe MB, which also includes bank reserves) [definition]( The M1, M2, etc... include non-liquid money, fractional reserves, etc.
I have no exact figure for the world M0, but the US M0 was 1.2 trillion US$ in 2013 ([source]( Assuming the same percentages you show here, US cash is 18.2% of the world cash. Therefore, the world M0 cash is about 6.6 trillion US$.
So, in case BTC become:
* 1% of world M0: 1 BTC = 3 140 US$
* 10% of world M0: 1 BTC = 31 400 US$
* 100% of world M0: 1 BTC = 314 000 US$

yes, and maybe... I would assume that BTC price is now very loosely related to M0, as its price is more heavily affected by speculation.

Yes, he's right.

Yes, M0 is only a tiny fraction of the world's economy. But keep in mind that even if in our wildest dreams BTC were adopted instead of US$ and instead of all other currencies, there would still be fractional reserves for bank accounts in BTC. You may have your 21M BTC just for the transactions, and a wider economy behind it. The banks would probably just be allowed to have a fractional reserve.

That's interesting, they are using [BitKassa]( which seems to be a Dutch service similar to BitPay. Hopefully it catches up in the rest of NL.

And it seems a very nice shop. Thanks for the link, I will definitely try it next time I go to Amsterdam!
