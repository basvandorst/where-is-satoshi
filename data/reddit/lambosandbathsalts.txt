uh, not true.  after splitting your coins you send them to the exchange.  just don't send all of them.  pick a # smaller than your total balance.

Even that would count as "freaky".  And it would only get you three hex digits on one side of the fork.


Among the most sinister possibilities: we have enough hashpower to start randomly undoing transactions on your side of the fork, stretching back hundreds of blocks.  Ordinary people who find that money they spent magically reappeared in their wallet tend to re-spend it again.  Other Peoples' Money falls from the sky, chaos ensues.  **These re-spends will get mixed in with legitimate spends,** so even if the politburo figures out what's going on in less than an hour (very unlikely) and every major exchange is willing to hardfork together they still can't fix it: you can't just roll back one transaction (like the DAOsaster) or even whole blocks, you'd just be robbing peter to pay paul.  It's an unrecoverable death blow to confidence.
I don't think they're that evil.  Just giving the most extreme example that came to mind to point out that this kind of power is not irrelevant, and that **if you're trying to argue "hashpower doesn't matter" then you're simply wrong.**
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:59:32
Bit4 is Bit4. Bit4 is irrelevant at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:01:04


... that also happens to be the one and only most popular convention.
If somebody found a funny pattern encoded as [EBCDIC]( character codes it would not be a big deal, since there are dozens of not-the-most-popular encodings to choose from.  Being able to pick the encoding is a degree of freedom.  Since there is only one most-popular encoding it does not represent a degree of freedom.
This is freaky, but if that's too much for you to handle go ahead and deny yourself to sleep.
Personally I'm starting to think it was a [warning shot]( probably from bitmain.

**Total hogwash.**
Versionbits signalling *currently is not* enforced by user nodes.  The fact that it *hypothetically could* be is irrelevant --  coinbase content "hypothetically could be" enforced by user nodes just as easily.  **In fact it is and has been for five years now:** since 2012 clients will reject any block whose Coinbase doesn't include the block height:
  
This was to prevent an attack (which was carried out) that caused two coinbase transactions to have the same hash, leading to lots of problems.

No... you know your transaction arrived if you see it in a block with the necessary PoW.  No need to connect directly to a miner for that.
I do agree that running a non-mining fully-validating node for any other reason than your own use (i.e. as or for your wallet) is idiotic.  These people who think they're doing some charitable service by setting up bazillions of AWS instances are just bozos.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:57:28

@_date: 2017-08-02 14:06:23
I've been thinking about this, and I'm pretty sure what happened here is that somebody with an enormous pile of **electricity-cost unprofitable miners** switched them on for just one block.
There is a lot of Bitfury55 gear out there, so much that people take gambles on shipping it to Venezuela knowing half of the shipments will get seized.  And I'm sure Bitmain has piles of S5s and S7s that either didn't sell or were less than fully functional.
So yes, pulling off a stunt like this is expensive, but not nearly as expensive as it looks.  The equipment used to do this is worthless if your goal is mining for profit, so having it do "vanity work" or sit idle isn't wasting a productive asset, it's just wasting a ton of electricity (for ten minutes between a specific pair of blocks).
In fact, in light of the extremely tense situation over the last few months, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody had been stockpiling uneconomical miners for a long time now.

AML KYC nightmare.
Imagine if you had to go through the AML KYC process separately with a completely new exchange for every stock you wanted to buy instead of just once when you open your brokerege account.  If your brokerege account is an IRA like it is for most people in the US, all the paperwork (too much of it IMHO) is forwarded by your employer who already knows shit about you, so you hardly have to deal with it at all.
This is why most people don't buy bitcoin, and I don't blame them.

They did that a long time ago.  It's why the Dark Ages never ended in China.
And when they bleat about the "Chinese" Remainder Theorem, remind them that the [theorem]( is actually [not Chinese]( at all but rather due to [an Indian](




After all, if he had proved it we would call it Sunzi's Remainder Theorem.  I doubt there are many adults who can't tell that's a Chinese family name.  But then he would be denounced as a fraudster, which is likely why it isn't named after him.  Much harder to call an entire country a fraudster...

Hey I agree with the sentiment of the title but this article is so riddled with errors it's dangerous.

No.  Money laundering is concealing *the proceeds of a crime*.
**If you have funds which are not the proceeds of a crime, no matter what you do with them it is not money laundering.**  No matter how hard you try.  Can't be done.
You also have to know or reasonably suspect that the funds are the proceeds of a crime, but the "reasonably suspect" part is a pretty huge loophole.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:53:57


First, this is wrong; for example S&amp;P futures are cash-settled, not delivered.  There are plenty of obviously-commodity futures that are cash-settled, like these (links) COMEX markets: [butter]( and [electricity](
Second in any case, what makes you think this won't be declared to be a "currency-like" future just like Yuan futures?
With the nightmare of AML/KYC compliance (what happens when fulfililng your futures contract would violate AML laws?) I guarantee you these contracts will be cash-settled as well.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:49:04
**This is bad.**
If this is the only instrument most people have for getting BTC exposure, they will "hold" BTC by buying a futures contract and perpetually rolling it over (or telling their broker to do so).
If this becomes the predominant way of holding BTC, it allows the SEC to engage in manipulation on a far greater scale than China has ever attempted.  They can **force people to SELL** their BTC by simply suspending the issuance of new futures contracts; the price will plunge as the existing ones expire and the holders are left with no way to extend their exposure.
Right now even China can't force its citizens to sell the BTC they already have.

It's very rare to sell a small business for no-strings-attached walk-away-from-it cash.  They're so hard to evaluate that few buyers are willing to take the risk of buying a lemon.
Most deals involve seller financing not because the buyer needs it but rather because it's effectively impossible to do the required due diligence without actually operating the business yourself for a while.
