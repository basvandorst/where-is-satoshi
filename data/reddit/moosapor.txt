I Like your reply!
Scaling data by a logarithmic scale is normally used when recording frequency in relation to amplitude.
What logarithmic bitcoin charts (in relation to price that is) are trying to show is that a rally on bitcoin occurs within a frequency, and that the price at the time of the rally multiplies by some factor, usually a factor of 10 in relation to US dollars.
What linear scales show is that over time Bitcoin's price continues to be unstable, hinting that there is actually no trend.
What's important to realize is that two charts, one log. and the other linear, can describe the same data. They can both be true at the same time.
To chart an earthquake we use a logarithmic scale. The ground moves in a very low "frequency", but the release of energy can be very large or very small depending on the amplitude of the movement of the ground.
To chart the number of occurrences of earthquakes around the world we will not use a logarithmic scale. We're charting the frequency of earthquakes, and a higher amplitude would mean "more earthquakes", but using a linear chart would present the data much better. For example, 100 earthquakes in 10 years is nothing like 1000 earthquakes in 10 years, though it would seem like it in a logarithmic chart.
How can we decide which is the better method to chart bitcoin?
I think a good start is to find correlations between multiple types of data. This creates a "sanity check".
Study both a logarithmic and linear scales of data sets like price, difficulty, number of new users on forums, media coverage, new ventures.. etc. There's always some kind of correlation, and if you can find causality, then you have the basis for sound predictions.
The reason I like 's reply is because he's right. Describing a data set in one way over another is really a matter of opinion, and arguments made of opinions are stupid :)

Reddit, please do not listen to this bullshit.
Bitcoin is not, and will never be regulated.
It does not fall under anyone's authority,
it does not belong to a government,
it will **always** be decentralized.
Bitcoin does not bind you to a legal entity. You can do whatever the fuck you want with it.
Don't let lenghty posts like this make you forget why we're **really** here.
We do away with money handlers, tax collectors and money lenders.
Their counterfeit paper money means nothing. It is backed by nothing and this is no longer a secret.
They use our tax money to pay for wars, prisons and propaganda.
They try to keep us uninformed with their artificial noise.
What you're reading here are lies.
Make the best out of Bitcoin. Don't let the old world tell you what to do.

Courts and legislators may say what they want about Bitcoin.
For many people, Bitcoin is a way to acquire more money, sort of like a get rich scheme, and this is why we now have tax collectors "causally" dumping a 15 page legal advice on reddit.
I see a lot of hate for alts on when the real problem are the speculants who make bitcoin unusable to the majority of the public.
There's no point for anyone who actually thinks bitcoin is going places to cash out their coins, simply because if a time does come when 1 bitcoin is 3000$, many businesses will be happy to accept, it that there will be no need for anyone to cash out.
The govt. can't take your coins, but they'll try to tax them, and we can't let that happen. How does a government issued bitcoin client sound to you?

An important quality of a "private key" that often doesn't come across when trying to understand PKI is that a private key is often really only a huge number (integer, a whole number).
When "randomly generating" that number, it's important to use such methods that guarantee that the number chosen is insignificant relatively to other numbers that might have been chosen using the same process.
Given a large enough "pool of numbers to choose from" (bitcoin has a lot), it should follow that when generating one number using the correct methods, that this number would probably only be generated once in the life time of our entire universe.
Now, suppose you keep this number a secret (that's the key word, no pun intended), let's see what you could do:
On the network, all coins (read: transactions) exist in the blockchain. A transaction has inputs and outputs. An input is a transaction that already exist in the blockchain and has not been used as an input in any other transaction, and an output is the new transaction to be written in the blockchain, often of differnt value from the original transaction(s).
To create a new transaction in the blockchain, you must "spend" a previous, yet unspent transaction, and to do that, you must provide the "solution" to some mathematical problem, presented to you by the blockchain itself. Your answer to that problem will then be validated by the miners, so you must answer correctly, or you will be ignored.
I can't really think of a proper layman's mathematical example for how this works, nor will I do justice with my here, but it demonstrates the power of a private (secret) number. Look at this set of equations :
    A + B = 10
    C + D = 20
    (A - B)(C - D) = 60
Finding the correct values of {A,B,C,D} is possible, and there is probably more than one set of values for these eqations, but it'll take time, possibly less than a second on a modern computer, but the computer would still have to *search* for these values through all possible combinations.
Now, suppose you know the value of C (as in, secret) beforehand, solving those equations should take you no more than 2 seconds.
So to summarize, nothing in bitcoin the network verifies you **own** the key. Simply owning, and not sharing the secret of the private key lets you send your coins to other people easily before anyone has the chance to guess your secret, or to find a different set of values that is *not* your secret, but would be deemed correct by the miners (completely possible with bitcoin).

A property of ECDSA signatures is that you can replace one value (s) with a different value (-s) and keep the signature valid.  When these signatures are inside transactions, they aren't being reliably relayed by nodes because of wide spread policy that almost all nodes apply, but since these signatures are still valid, even if the change from 's' to '-s' was done by a third party (which is trivial), they are completely valid in blocks.
If a node receives a block with a signature containing '-s', it doesn't consider it invalid, so combining how it's trivial for a third party to change 's' to '-s', and how miners are those who ultimately decide what goes in a block, you can see how miners currently are able to create transaction malleability if they please, with anyone's transactions.  Most don't only because they're being nice.
What happened just now is one pool deciding to act on this ability, and seems like some services got hit.  For most uses, you wouldn't even know that it happened, but if your service tracks transaction IDs (txid), then it'll this will be an aissue because transaction malleability means changing the txid, without invalidating the transaction.
Segwit's handling of signatures doesn't include them in the data hashed for the txid, although they are still kept with the transaction, just in a different place (before the nLockTime field), verifiable by all segwit aware nodes and miners.
This isn't about block size, but about certain folks dismissing segwit's fix of transaction malleability as if it isn't needed, which is now made obviously false.

Correct!  fixed.
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:44:45


That's right, and the lies and uncertainty surrounding segwit signaling (or the lack thereof) seems to have everything to with covert asicboost.  We should try a UASF. It's clear that the community can commit to one.
I think a point made by , that BIP148 tries to take advantage of an already "in progress" BIP9 signal is a good one.  It's a mechanism for deployment that I don't think was used in Bitcoin yet.  It needs a lot more testing than it received, but sadly the window will be closing soon...
Is it worth to rush BIP148 specifically so we can get segwit, or should we set our sights a bit further, and first try to solve the root problem for it not activating in the first place?
The anti-covert-asicboost BIP as a BIP9 signal *and* simultaneously setting a  date \ height UASF will be a good test for how viable UASF's are (*in the face of offensive miners), will probably cause low disruption if done enough in advance, and will set the rule for inclusion of a wtxid commitment that is a perfect placeholder for when segwit does finally activate.
No news regarding the anti-covert-asicboost BIP itself (that I could find), Sergio Demian Lerner is the current champion of the BIP afaik.
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:12:40
Yep.  I'm less worried about the "normalization" of the language (though that might change if the terms become even softer) and more about the actual implementation to follow.  It shouldn't be *too* hard to implement, I think..  Witness commitments are already implemented and mocking up a blank one where you only need to replace the generation transaction's txid with a bunch of zeroes and re-hash is easy even if your codebase is segwit agnostic entirely.
I have high hopes for this, but until we see an actual implementation it means absolutely nothing.

There is also a second solution :
    TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE 0
Both solutions were known for a while now, but neither can be used to easily redeem the utxo.  
The script leaves a _dirty stack_ (more than one value at the end of execution, with the top value being True), making it non standard.  Because it's non standard, the chances of any miner picking a transaction spending this utxo to their mempool is highly unlikely.
Until some miner actively spends it (really, I'm not sure why none did yet), it's there to stay.  At least it's only $20 :)
@_date: 2019-01-05 09:04:19
Technically it's :
1. Execute `scriptSig` in the redeeming transaction
2. Execute `scriptPubKey` from the funding transaction with the stack that was left from the step (1) execution
3. Since this is p2sh, execute the `redeemScript` with the stack that was left from step (2) execution.
But you're right, there is no way to clean up the stack here.

You hit the nail on the head.  Appealing to these companies will do nothing.  As long a their value keeps rising, they don't give a shit what we call bitcoin.  It's clear that they're ready and willing to play either or both sides, depending on what is most profitable for **them** right **now**.
These companies never invest any of their resources into Bitcoin protocol development, and now we see why.  They simply don't care what becomes of Bitcoin as long as their pockets keep filling up with dollars.
The people who run these companies, who use their money and connections to try and change what the word Bitcoin refers to, the same people you already listed are the ones us users should be messaging.  Not `support or `contact or whatever.
Expose these frauds.  End your business with them.  Exploit their inadequacies when they try to double down and pull the rug from under Bitcoin.
Their only concern is their shareholders and their own bank account, and that's where it will hurt most when their scheme eventually crashes.  The more of these CEOs understand this, the less of them will be willing to go through something like this next time it's attempted.
See Coinbase's history in dealing with hard forks, and even more so hard forks without replay protection.  This is the kind of service you would expect out of such clueless and out of touch "blockchain service" industries.

You could, but I was trying to keep from using a local keychain in this guide.
We already download the binary from some other website, so the worst github could do is replace the keys and signed gitian logs with some other keys and signatures who will have to sign the same hash as the file we downloaded (signing the same gitian log with a different key would achieve that, but why bother?).
You could also try locating the same pgp key in one of the directories and compare.
