Well, that's wrong right there. In GrampaNo's dialect they don't call them "rolls of dimes"... they're called "bundles" of dimes, like a bundle of sticks.

No, that would be your communist subreddit r/enoughpaulspam.

You're totally wrong. Take some of NoLibs' silver dimes and see if you can spend them at the store. I guarantee you can.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:19:26


But that's not what you said earlier. 
You claimed, "*Also, in the US you can't exactly use precious metals as currency*" and I just proved you wrong. You can still spend NoLibs' silver dimes, (if he'll give you a few). LOL
Until fairly recent history, Americans used to use precious metals as currency *all the time* and the government provided the precious metals. What happened?

"Hello, Ma'am. Can I buy five bundles of of nickels and two bundles of pennies?"-GrampaNo.

Like when you claimed this: 


Some facts! LOL

I love the irony in your name-calling, considering how you're here trolling with your anti-bitcoin EPS buddies.

Let's see that link to the definition of "bundle", Tzvika. Try to be honest, for once. I'll wait. This is gonna look great on LOL
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:29:41
You have encountered an infamous neocon, authoritarian troll known as Nolibs.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:40:54
Let's see the actual *link* to that definition, tzvika. I think you're being dishonest. And btw how many nickels in a bundle? LOL
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:38:17


A night with Josh? Two nights?
So you only have the *one* silver dime? That's about what I figured. LOL
edit: added the "two-nights" option when I remembered Josh's nickel-a-night special for neo-con old men.

Oh, so they're not "rolls" of coins in "boxes", they're "bundles" of coins in "bigger bundles". 
Is that a local dialect? How do you differentiate the big coin "bundles" (boxes) from the little coin "bundles" (rolls) in conversation? Say, for instance, when you ask the teller for a "bundle" of nickels: how will he or she know whether you want a little "bundle" or a big "bundle"?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:44:13
Show me the link, GrampaNo.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:30:05


How in the world does anyone imagine "bundles" of half dollars and dimes? LOL How would that even *work*?  Hilarious!
I can tell you're a young boy who lacks experience in the real world. That's probably why you follow a much older man around reddit, helping him to pull his baggy pants up after they fall.

He's in favor of torture, loves the Fed, thinks pot smokers need to be imprisoned and has been hankering to invade Iran for years. He was banned on Digg for posting gay porn and has been banned dozens of times on reddit.

FYI jcm267 the troll has x-posted this to his subreddit r/dumbasses.

The government is afraid and so it lashes out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:39:50
Bundles? LOL
