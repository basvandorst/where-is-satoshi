Becouse they could not transact their 10$ worth of bitcoin. It would be locked in the wallet. Furthermore, I pay 20$ to create a 10$ wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:22:00
Instead of splitting the community, why not help fix bitcoin. This war is not good for anyone.

Except most, like me, dont give a rats ass about lightning or segwit for that matter. I bought and now hold bitcoin because there is a greater fool to sell to in the future. Just riding the bubble boys. But sure, keep pushing out upgrades that pull in more pigs that buy. Drive that price up baby.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:51:05
Aparently you have to open up indidvidual payment channels, each with an initial on chain transaction. Ergo, the average user is not going to use it. Its not going to solve anything.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:14:22
Because butcoin fee's are at fucking 50 bucks so its not usible
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:49:32
So its useless? Let me just spend 1000$ to open up payment chanels with everyone I want to trade with. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:28:44
You cant trust something that bypasses peer review
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:45:54
What is the utility of bitcoin at the moment, tell me. Back in 2014 I gave my dad ~20$ worth of bitcoin (0.05), I can now not do the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:54:47
Because to open a channel you pay 50$ transaction fee's
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:41:56
Okay vote it down

There will always be a place online where you can be annonymous, it may get less acessible, but it will exist. Just keep the good stuff on facebook and do the crazy shit on tor or whatever
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:34:33
Yes because the general population is on our side right ;)

Your grampa? Lol
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:55:45
Perhaps. I sometimes wonder if it isent less than 10 years off. Some people are ready for it. I know those who dont handle cash anymore. Smartphone pay is coming fast. I wouldnt be surprised if ita less than 5 years off.
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:30:33
So, dont put anything incriminating online...

Well you can with the gold backed debit card. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:09:19
This is a good point. What is the objection to second layer micropayment platforms? This would silence the critisism to a large extent.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:33:29
Yes I agree. But give us the layer 2 systems! When I buy a coffee I dont require the same security as I would when buying a car. I want to be able to use bitcoin to buy my coffee.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:28:43
Then we damn well should make sure this critique is not valid, and at the moment it is. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:37:04
Thats your only wealth. Your display of arrogance and compremising ignorance proves it. Protect it better.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:29:55
Im going to have to google some of this stuff. Yet clearly, there is a market for secure microtransactions and if not supported via bitcoin then some other platform will scoop this market. And this market could be huge. 
Also, the demand for security is relative to transaction size. If I buy a coffee I am comfortable with less security then I would be when im buying a car.
Bitcoin now has the lead, but who knows for how much longer. It would be prudent to take steps now to secure the microtransaction market.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:31:47
Charlie Shrem is rationalizing the destruction of a major bitcoin selling point. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:31:07
Or perhaps youre suffering from cognitive dissonace? Clearly the abillity to support micropayments was touted as a major breakthrough for online content consumption. 
If you tell me that low fees can only be supported at the cost of security then Bitcoin is not the payment breakthrough it was advertised to be.  
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:20:37
Actualy most of us would agree with his economic thinking around here I suspsect. I just dont think he studied bitcoin very well.

Listen, accept that the government will not be forced to use THE blockchain, but would rather run their own analog. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:41:19
Why should Bitcoin be superior? It is now, but why should that remain the case. We have our problems, who is to say that a significant investment by the banking sector cannot produce a better system? Remember that bitcoin wad invented by one guy or at best by few. It would be a fallacy to assume that it is not subject to improvement.
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:52:18
This would be entirely unpractical to implement, much like torrenting. Also, a lot of shady stuff could be prevented by limiting people from hiding in the dark (this applies only to online presence ofc, nobody should be physically restricted to take time off from the prying eyes of the world.
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:30:05
Take it easy on him, the 25 year old shiff would have been in the Bitcoin bandwagon. Hes just a bit rusty, but he has the same vallues.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:00:41
I would agree, infact the FED researcher who proposed fedcoin already mentioned that they could forego the feature of finite currency in their adoptation. Still, it does not mean that with siginificant investment one cannot improve the concept of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:06:45
Now take your statement, go back to any bubble in history and swap out the word bitcoin for whatever you are applying it to. You must acknowledge that this is exactly the type of irrational 'rationality' that people use to defend their position in a bubble. And this is coming from someone who owns and has owned bitcoin for a long time. Why do I hold them? Because im riding a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:00:47
It is very akin to the internet bubble. In addition, the internetbubble was also based on a valid underlying technology that eventually made it. Pets.com however didnt make it, and it is difficult to estimate if bitcoin is Pets.com or Amazon.com which were both implementations of the internet, just as Bitcoin is an implementation of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:22:40
Im a bitcoiner, but the economist is comepletely right here imo. I see it everywhere, my family, my colleagues my friends. They all want to get in, but when I try to explain them how bitcoin works they dont care! They just want to get in!

You can draw these lines any which way to make it seem like a buying opportunity. Ive seen the same lines drawn to indicate a bottom at 11k and at 8k. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:25:10
We are miles away from a situation wherein a dealer could pay his supplier directly with bitcoin. Why should a dealer want to hold bitcoin when his supplier does not want them, a large part of the sale ofcourse goes to resupply of product. At this moment selling product for bitcoin directly is not a good strategy in that market
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:04:58
So there is replay protection? Otherwise coinbase would never credit both coins.

What I worry about is that China's ban may make it acceptable for other countries to follow suit. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:29:36
Bitcoin WAS a movement untill people like my nephew, mom and colleague started buying it. My nephew bought it stating that he may be able to make enought to pay for his wedding, my colleague put 1k in stating that he hoped it would double by the end of the year so he can pay for his PhD prints, and my mom basically does whatever I tell her financially. People buy bitcoin because they have FOMO and dont make anything from putting their money in the bank.

Since people earn their wage in dollars and would like to spend that wage on various items such as coffee, it matters. Bitcoin offers no solution here, dollars are more attractive for buying coffee.

Could you not answer those questions by saying that you were an early investor in bitcoin and youre checking out a portion now?

Will you not concede that many who buy bitcoin are jumping in on an appreciating asset for the sole reason of profit?
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:32:01

So explain to me how one would get payed or take loans in bitcoin. The volatillity argument he makes seems quite reasonable. For stabillity you would have to peg the loan or wage to the dollar, which defeats the purpose. Imagine getting payed 2btc/month, its in your contract, now it goes down to 100$/btc, you have a problem. Now you can solve it by pegging the wage to the dollar and say, youll get 2k$ in bitcoin/month. But if we want to ultimately supplant fiat then this defeats the purpose.

Love this guy, agree with much of his thesis on the global economy, but bitcoin idiot.
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:56:46
Look man ive invested into bitcoin since 2013 because I believe in the technology. Nevertheless, when I take into account the massive amount of questions i get from friends, family and collegues in the last few weeks, it suggests that much of the price increase is purely driven by speculation. Im not dilusional, I know many people have entered the bitcoin market lately only to exit it at the moment the price tanks significantly. It is not driven by pure technological interest. Dont be so blind man.

I for one am happy to back a coin that governments like, since governments tend to win. Also, im not here on some principle, some change the world movement. Im here to make money and I go where the money goes. 90% of investors are exactly like me. Your little project blew up and now its a money malking paradise, and guess what, you attract a lot of scumbags like me that would throw a granny under the buss for profit.
