Money has to be difficult to get and consistent in measurement of its amount.  BTC isn't backed by anything either.

Diversification is for those that don't know what they are doing.  Not being critical, just stating the truth.  If you fall into that category like I do, then diversify.
For example, last year, I made most of my money off of BTC over stocks, real estate, etc.  It was a total accident.  I didn't intend to make money off of BTC.  It just happened that way because I diversified because I didn't know what I was doing.

The current market cap for bitcoin is $196Billion.  There is no reason to believe it will stop at $1trillion.  The current USA funds in credit cards is $1.2trillion.  Bitcoin is international, and the total market cap now isn't that high.

I miss having a president that can speak like an educated adult.

I guess the government could issue a law, but in principal they can't really make it forceful any more than using a barter system or cash transactions illegal.

In fact, fiat currency has about 3% deflated value per year and they print more to keep that deflation going.  BTC is opposite.  Once it becomes mainstream and stable, it will appreciate steadily at some nominal rate because there will never be more BTC.
