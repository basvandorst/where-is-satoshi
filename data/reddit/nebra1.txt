@_date: 2019-07-10 03:46:26
How do you know its one guy? May be many orders at that price...
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:01:28
Why does this market even react to what banks are doing in this space? Isnt the whole point of crypto to move away from them? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:09:07
Nice to see new ppl entering the market, gives me hope. My advice is first learn as much as you can about it and other currancies before investing. And no your not too late, its not even a beginning...
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:53:52
This is fourth suckers rally.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:31:41
Just the right time...the price just tanked.
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:44:13
No, pretty sure i think of argentina. Wasnt inflation a problem over there for quite some time?
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:17:46

"In it for the tech"
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:04:23
If you thinking long term then yes...if short then no. We had three rallys before this one and none started a new bullrun. Every time this happens ppl get to optimistic and then when its a downtrend ppl asking why is it going down. Not every rally is runed by bews also, there also manipulation etc... You have to understand a bit of market psychology and cycles to know approximately how this works. Now im not an expert but my guess is were going to hit resistence to around 7500$ then go down again....but dont take my word for it.
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:22:33
Did she get it right?
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:09:50
Isnt this old news?
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:11:31
No....i think we will have another downtrend soon....
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:52:46
It will definitely go either up or down...
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:01:45
This is an investment advice.

You got screwed lol
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:43:01
The day will come when so much money is going to be pumped into crypto itll hurt my head...
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:47:06
A lot of controversy around tether. They claim that is fully backed by fiat dollar 1:1 but as far as i know there hasnt been an audit yet...either cuz there is no fiat money, or not enough fiat money backing the coin, or maybe they are just afraid to do a full audit cuz maybe us government would shut them down if they knew which bank holds the money. Either way its a riski coin...but it comes in handy to have a stable coin in crypto, there are few others though like tusd or dai...
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:04:39
I hear twins etf was rejected cuz their etf share price would be entirely depended on the price of btc on their exchange. Even cboes futures contracts uses a measure from variety of different exchanges. Plus gemini exchange doesnt have nearly enough volume to be the prominent measure to measure a net volume of btc.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:31:33
My prediction is bull run starts on may 45th at 67:56 sharp. Just be ready...
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:51:59
Thats more like it :)
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:22:25
Or we just make a new car manufacturer Sathosi and name a first car model Bitcoin...or other way around. Just imagine...wow is that a new Bitcoin car? Lol

Just goes to show you how curent financial system is obsolete really. And not just financial system but every system which supports the idea that many are ruled by a few. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 03:00:35

@_date: 2018-06-14 10:25:59
Was this sheet made prior to btc ath or after?
@_date: 2018-06-20 10:50:27
Btc moves according to manipulation, not news, id say.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:36:37
If i understand this correctly, if ppl would buy this ETFs they wouldn actually own btc but just shares, correct?
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:24:26
They can watch but they cant touch...
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:33:15
Sail not the boat...what would i do with the boat?
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:17:50
Yes another shitcoin...
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:28:31
There have to be noobs and ppl who have no idea what they are investing in otherwise some wouldnt make money off of it.
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:03:23
Patience my friend...
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:28:03

I love you too
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:45:20
Im excited to see how low it can go. Be sure ill invest more into this after seeing what a bullrun can do in terms of profit. Patiance is the key here...
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:49:56

@_date: 2018-11-08 08:25:20
I know right, its crazy. We live in a world where in some places youre in debt the second you are born.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:17:26
Is it necessary for me to open my own ln channel or can i send funds through other ppls channels?
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:34:50
Thats crazy...good thing its payed off.
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:22:46

@_date: 2018-11-25 15:46:57
Ppl intetested why is it crashing...
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:21:35
The only downside is you can never know whats going to happen...but thats ok.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:50:52
And if i understand this corectly i would have to stak a certain amount of btc to open the channel as an incetive to be fair to the network?
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:26:43
Ppl look at me strange, sort of surprised, when i mention that...
@_date: 2018-11-08 08:28:07
Not exactly. You can get a sholorship and live in a students home which is cheeper than renting an apartment.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:44:42
Where did the money go?
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:10:04
How is fiat going to flow through exchanges then?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:16:12
Oh isnt there a situation where you can lose your btc you have staked?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:04:27
Well i bought so its going to go down...sorry to disappoint you.
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:10:31

@_date: 2018-02-09 21:32:24
There is no bank on this planet that does not launder money...thats one of the main funcionts of the bank.

@_date: 2018-04-29 17:26:32
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:26:29
No, it is not. Happens with " the the" also. I just thought it has something to do with the actual grammer. Thanks for clarifying that for me.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:30:58
Case closed...
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:07:59

Sorry something off topic...ive been seeing this a lot lately but why did you wrote will two times? Is this a typo or does it have a meaning?
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:16:27
As if on purpose.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:38:48
If it would be opposite it would say: if hes so pro bch...Roger should rename hes domain to bitcoincash.com...
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:36:57
