If there will be mining heaters, i bet there will  also be heaters for different algorithms. So we have three possible scenarios now:
1) people who don't care about the extra money will ignore the algo change
2) people who do care might buy a new one
3) altcoin miners not affected

For me, 101 looks like the only solution that actually has a optimistic look on bitcoin's future (comparing to other solutions).
100 gives way too much power to the miners, which can LOWER the block size.  It is supposed to be "We the people who use bitcoin" and not "We the rich people with hardware"
Lighting and side chains are centralized solutions. I might as well use coinbase or xapo for transferring coins then.
and don't get me started on Replace By Fee as a solution for scaling.
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:58:04
What's your reasoning behind this?
@_date: 2015-12-26 04:33:58
It was originally aimed to be two things:
* The "Silver" cryptocurrency, where bitcoin would be the "Gold".
* Put mining back into everybody's home. Bitcoin had it's SHA-256 asic boom, making mining with graphics cards obsolete. Litecoin used a more memory intensive algorith (scrypt) that made it harder to develop asics for (AFAIK, I might be wrong). So everybody was mining scrypt coins with their graphics cards (even me! c:). Eventually, we developed asics for scrypt anyway and that went away.
As it stands now... well... i's just a satellite of bitcoin. Although, if something went horribly wrong with bitcoin, people will migrate to altcoins. One good reason on why that might happen is if the network gets so congested that people no longer wish to wait for bitcoin's tiny bandwidth and move onto a less congested currency

Bitcoins are transferred directly from person to person via the net, this means there is *no bank or clearing house*. This makes the fees *much lower*, you can *use them in every country*, *your account cannot be frozen*, and there are *no limits*. The seller doesn't have to worry about *chargebacks.*

Oh, it's the Shemitah channel. Last year, he claimed that on some exact day of September, everything would collapse. What's so special about that September? September is the [7-year cycle's]( last month, and he claimed that previous economic crisises happened VERY close to the ends of these 7 year cycles. 
What the pathetic point about this is, he REALLY pushed for that date in september, he was practically counting down the months, the weeks, the days until the end of the 7-year cycle, swearing that everything will bust on that day. Encouraging everyone to take action about this event, Oh God, the horror!
**then the day comes, and the day leaves.** The 7-year cycle begins it's first year. Nothing happens. It's now October, and everything is fine. It's now November, now December, and now January. ***nothing happened.***

I'm worried that the next rally will bring in new people, those people will make transactions, and then the network might clog up.

For a non-technical person, this will completely discourage then from using this wonderful currency again.

First one is the correct technical answer.
Miners try to find the correct hash of a block. Most of the difficulty is in finding a [huge amount of consecutive zeroes]( in the block hash. About every two weeks, the requirement for getting the correct answer changes, either to something that is easier to find or something harder to find. 
Since the difficulty of finding this hash is so high, it's very hard to rewrite history by submitting a ton of your own valid blocks. Look up the 51% attack for more info.
The actual validation is done on all nodes. Nodes are the things that decide what to broadcast to other nodes and what to ignore. But miners offer immutability to the ledger.

To ban bitcoin you will need to ban the transfer of information. You can integrate a transaction into almost anything. 
Also, if you seriously argue that governments will shut down core infrastructure that pretty much our entire society runs on just to cripple a magic internet token, they're going to have bigger problems other than keeping their fiat money alive.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:12:34
Bitcoin node software =/= Bitcoin protocol. (well, technically it is, but nodes can have different features and utilities)
100% of the network needs to run the same protocol, if someone doesn't, this makes them part of a different network. (that's why the block size debate is so heated. We want/don't want to change the protocol) However, it doesn't matter what percentage runs whatever client as long as everyone is following the same protocol.
If your wallet creates erroneous transactions because someone messed up it's code, and is then rejected by the network because it  doesn't follow the blockchain, then all is well.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:12:46
And you simply need to ban all drug dealers and get all of the cops to agree to stop and jail dealers.

@_date: 2015-07-27 13:29:32
We have an immutable, public ledger. If someone notices coins popping out of thin air, practically everyone will be scrambling to find the exploit and then hard fork to fix it. Luckily, no one has successfully managed to make a single "bad" transaction
Different versions of nodes CAN disagree with each other, and cause a fork. But that mostly happens with 
protocol rules, not erroneous transactions.
Shortly: if it's a protocol problem, that's a big problem, we need to fork the blockchain. If it's a small problem in the wallet software (i.e. making transactions that are instantly rejected by the network) then it's an easy fix.

I don't know of any brute-forcing software, but making one for your scenario should be relatively simple.
[Mycelium has 2048 possible words](
Before bruteforcing, try checking your words against this list, maybe you misspelled some of them. If not, let's do some math on how hard it will be to bruteforce 3 words. 2048^3 would be about 8.6 BILLION different combinations, and that's not including trying 
to place those combinations in different spots in that 12 word seed, further multiplying that 8.6 billion by 1,320. Now we have ~11.36 trillion combinations of keys.
And so one last question remains, "How fast would my computer be able to crunch through these numbers?" Well, I have absolutely no idea since I have no experience in bruteforcing things. For each key the computer cycles through it would have to check if one of the generated addresses match one of yours. Your computer would have to crunch through [this script]( to find the private key, and then calculate a public key, and finally check it against the public key you have. This should take longer than other brute forcing operations against passwords, since passwords only hide behind about one hash^^[citation ^^needed]
I'm sorry to hear that this happened to you, good luck getting your bitcoin back!

I mined with them before on a small, about 70$ contract at the time. They pay you daily with ever decreasing amounts, and one day, it just stops. Then you go check your dashboard on their website and its as if you never purchased that contract. 0 Hashes running, 0 Earnings, zero everything and only a button that says "Buy more has power!".
In the end I had less coins than I did before, and a wallet that needed to use a bajillion inputs to pay for something (bajillion inputs = larger transaction size = pay more fees when transacting).
Shortly, "Lifetime contract" my ass. I guess its good only for money launderers or credit card thieves or something.

How I see gold and bitcoin:
Gold is ***perfect*** as a store of value, so if I had to (for some reason) put all of my life savings into something other than a bank or matress, I'd choose gold. It has kept it's value for over 3,000 years, and you can't beat that.
Bitcoin, however, is good as "wallet cash", since it's quite volatile (hopefully just for now), it's a wonderful way to send money with almost no fee - instantly. This is something gold simply can not do in the 21st century.
tl;dr: gold wins as a store of value, bitcoin wins as "wallet cash"

Miners create the supply, everyone else creates the demand. They can currently supply 25 BTC (about) every 10 minutes.  It's their btc, and they can do whatever they want with it - hold it, sell it, whatever. They can't really make the value go up, this is like owning a wheat farm, and trying to get the price of wheat to go up - not really possible.


In every block there is one transaction that creates coins out of nothing as a mining reward. This CAN be literally anything you want, but it does not mean everyone else will agree with you getting 5,000 coins from a block. The 25 btc reward is in effect because everyone agrees that miners should receive 25 btc right now.


If one individual (or group) reaches 51% of the world's mining power, then they have the ability to preform a 51% attack. Read [this]( to see what they can do with 51% of the network's hash power. (You should worry way too much about this, doing this requires a ridiculous amount of hardware and money to pull this off.)

In the video he says that after a fork, there will be two bitcoins, each with their own separate blockchains. Your coins will be on both sides. So if you have 1.5 btc now, you will have 1.5 btc on "bitcoin A" and 1.5 on "bitcoin B".
Andreas starts talking about this around 5:00, but the entire video is still a good watch

The situation with Karpeles was a painful but necessary lesson that you can not trust anyone 100% with coins you don't control.
If it wasn't for Karpeles then it would have definitely been someone else.

No, you can't put Etherium into breadwallet,  since it's a wallet just for bitcoin. If you're looking for an eth wallet, a quick google search should give you many options

Oh I see what you mean.

He's talking about governments who love wars, not governments in general. Wars are expensive and VERY difficult to fund without the financial aid of printing currency. "The Hidden Secrets of Money" documentary talks about this briefly.

They read the EULA multiple times, and they're following it. I'd love to link a source where they say that, but I don't remember where they put it.
It can't be pay to win since you can't deposit any bit into your account. But no one knows for sure that nature of admins, hopefully they stay clean

Are you the guy from youtube? I guess so...

In the second video, the name "Satoshi Nacomoro" killed me.
Good stuff, thanks for sharing.

Head on over to bitcoin.org and pick one out for yourself.
I personally use electrum for holding all of my coins, xapo for &lt;$10 holding (yes, it's a centralized wallet but my account is accessible both on my phone and desktop, and I prefer to move coins only on my desktop. But that's just a stupid quirk I have)

Personally I love the XThin blocks unlimited offers.

wasn't worse than it was now before the entire censorship fiasco went down.  just became its own thing, which then became an echo chamber
