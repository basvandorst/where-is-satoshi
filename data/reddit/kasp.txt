I seem to recall someone had a bitcoin bank in Australia already.
It got hacked and people lost millions.

Huge difference between inflation over 20-50 years and a market crashing and bouncing several times a day.
If bitcoin was a currency it would be like experiencing hyper inflation and deflation on a daily basis. The fact is bitcoins as a currency sucks you need stability in your currency or you will never get confidence.

No.  You can't escape the whole fear and greed aspect of markets.
Also I love how people are saying it is some conspiracy that bitcoins are dropping in price.  It went up in value almost 10 times its worth in an incredibly short amount of time.  Of course it set itself up for a huge crash.

It has nothing in common with the Euro.
Bitcoins have more in common with the sharemarket than a currency. For this reason it will never really be a widely used currency and the shops who accept them (myself included) only do so because it can be exchanged for cash.

The thing I find funny is that the price exploded 10x what it was worth in a very short period of time and everyone at the time was saying it just shows the true value of bitcoin and it would go into the 1000's.  It then crashed extremely predictably and all of a sudden they are blaming market manipulation. 
If I had any investment and they suddenly jumped 10x in value when nothing had really changed and then saw a decline you bet your ass I would bail out of that investment in a heart beat expecting a crash.  I am guessing a lot of investors did the exact same thing which brought forward the crash.
But you know massive conspiracy sounds more interesting.

How can you legitimize a currency that regularly goes up and down vast amounts in a single day.  THe only reason people take bitcoins is because it can be traded in for actual currency using payment gateways.

Oh of course there is some degree of manipulation but it happens in all markets.  However bit coins massive gains set it up for a crash.  They are only worth what someone is willing to pay.  If people honestly didn't believe they were overpriced the crash wouldn't have happened.
Mass speculation is what caused the market to rise and crash so dramatically. Plus half the people playing the game seem to be kids messing with a computer.

The problem is bitcoin can't really be used as a currency. The value changes too much too quickly and to top it off it is extremely difficult to use for cheaper purchases.
Say I want to buy something worth 25 bucks exactly how many bitcoins is that worth and what exchange should that go by?  Right now the exchanges out there seem to have a serious difference in price by up to 100 dollars a coin.
This makes it viability of a currency very slim and all the vendors who take bitcoin seem to convert it immediately to cash.
So it's value seems to be more of a commodity but I have to wonder what will happen when all the coins are mined?  The miners are left with all this equipment and will probably go looking for another coin and concentrate on that.  There goes a serious chunk of the market.

I am waiting until it stabilizes for at least a month on around the samish levels.
However I have no idea how low that would be.  My guess is around the 30 mark but wouldn't surprise me if it was much much lower.

His portfolio is 100 bucks so it isn't that bad.
