Given the posters name, I assume he's German. In German "Million" is also abbreviated "Mio".

It was DDoSed by a competitor who just [admitted to it]( Unbelievable.

I run WeUseCoins.com, we verified the owners ID before listing them. As sgornick already posted, the site is run by Tom McCabe. We've not received any complaints about the listing so far and the people who've used the site seem to be happy with the service.

When you use Shapeshift you have to trust the operator of Shapeshift to deliver the currency you're buying. Interledger is basically a way to make it so you don't have to trust the connector.
And when you don't have to trust the connector you can pick the cheapest rate between Shapeshift and whoever else is out there. Don't get me wrong, I think Shapeshift is great and I'm sure they're trustworthy, but in the long run having some competition is going to be important if you want rates to be as low as possible.

The connectors themselves are untrusted. We use escrow such that the connector has to deliver funds at the destination before they get paid themselves. So if a connector gets hacked, the person who ran that connector will be the only one who loses money.
Hacking is always a risk, but we think that connectors can set themselves up to be secure enough such that the risk is acceptable.

That's correct. Fees on RCL still require XRP.
Along with our ILP release we announced that banks no longer have to pay XRP.
Here's how that works: With ILP, banks are ledgers, so even if they're doing a transaction through RCL, there is some connector between RCL and the bank. (Think: market maker) So the bank pays the market maker in, say, USD and then the market maker is the one who pays the XRP fee for the next leg.
This helps even when the bank is its own market maker. Market making is done by the FX desk of a bank, which is a lot more likely to be ok with holding a "foreign" currency (b/c that's what they do) than the transaction banking dep't which pretty much just works in the bank's native currency and has no way to account for currency risk etc.
So it's just a way to provide an easier path for banks to trade through XRP. There is value for them to use it, but we have to remove as much friction as we can.

Yeah, but just to be clear: Even if a connector gets hacked *while* you're making a payment through it, you would not lose money.
Your payment would fail, you'd get the money back from escrow and you could try again.
So users typically wouldn't even notice if a connector got hacked.

Yeah, I see what you're saying. There is always a lot of temptation to launch things early and we did get a ton of valuable feedback through our preliminary beta. But the downside (especially with open-source/decentralized stuff) is that your project can take on a life of its own, before you're ready for it.
On the promotion aspect - that's obviously not my department, but afaik, our promotion right now is focused on the newsletter where you can sign up to be notified when we launch.

Hey! Stefan Thomas, Ripple client lead developer here.
First off, the headline is false. **Ripple does not store your password, plain text or otherwise.**
The only reason the client knows your password is because you just entered it to log in. It isn't stored persistently. Anywhere. Ever.
What is stored is an encrypted copy of your wallet. The encryption key is derived from your username and password. A different key, derived from the same values, is used as an index so that the blob vault can find your wallet when your client asks for it.
In other words, the blob vault **does not know your password**. In fact it doesn't even know your username. All it has is a SHA-256 hash of both of them concatenated together.
The current login system was designed by my predecessor and there are several major improvements we're planning to make. Obviously changing a cryptographic login system is a big act - everyone will have to migrate their accounts. So we've decided to bundle up all the upgrades together, you can expect the new login system to come out in about 2-3 months. Until then, my recommendation is to use a very long, cryptographically secure password - I personally use 24 characters mixed case with numbers via a password manager. Once the new login system is deployed, you should be secure with a standard 6-8 character password.
Please keep in mind that Ripple is in early beta. If you wanna live on a construction site, wear a helmet.
[Github issue for the new login system](
PS: Fighting for Ripple while everyone is against it feels a lot like when I was fighting for Bitcoin two and a half years ago and met a ton of resistance even from libertarians like Nielsio. Mostly I think people didn't want to understand it and whatever information there was, was often confusing. I think it's rational to be a Ripple skeptic at this stage: server source not released, most major features are still in development, if they are even announced at all. I guess I'm asking for the one thing the Internet doesn't have: patience. :)

Saying that a common length password 6-8 is "NOT secure" with the current system is maybe a bit too strong of a statement.
The client enforces some rules on password strength, so when you pick a short password like 6-8 characters it'll force you to at least have not just lowercase letters. (The exact algorithm is [kind of a scoring system.](
An online attack against a password of that type is pretty infeasible, you'd probably just take down the blobvault if you tried. So an hacker would have to break either into your computer (to get your LocalStorage) or break into the blobvault server, so that he can get the SHA256 hash of username+password and do an offline attack on it.
So I'd say it's an average level of security. It's like using MtGox with just a password or PayPal with just a password. But take it from someone who has lost a lot of coins once, consider sacrificing a little bit of convenience for a little more security and pick a long password and a [secure way to store it](

Please just let me code for now. ^ ^
First of all, I'm not very diplomatic, i.e. I say dumb stuff that gets me into trouble.
Second of all, right now the answer to a lot of questions would be "we're working on it" - so I'd rather actually *be* working on it. :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:42:03
Right now, the username and password is just thrown in the same pot. So in a way, yes, a longer username is going to give you some extra security. But I cringe just saying that.
Focus on your password being secure. Use a username you like.
