Lol, chill. Lord Vitalik having his own Blockchain with hookers and blow is not a bad thing, whatever is proven to be useful will be implemented on top of Bitcoin blockchain.

So what is the right decision to support the whole world?

We don’t have a “Youtube internet” or a “Facebook internet” although these are legitimate user cases, aren’t they?

Thank you for elaborate reply. I am not a developer and first time hearing about “quadratic hashing problem” and have known idea what it means. Why the size of blocks with Segwit affects miners incentive? It’s always the same - block reward.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:18:20
Implement the fucking segwit!!

Have been there today. Unfortunately my coinpunk html wallet refused to send money by some reason.

I like BitWallet.

Have some patience, my friend. We are on a steady trajectory to the Moon.

Bitcoin price - no fucks given :I

It is still in App Store, well at least in AU.

Whoever they are they are doing the right thing - making bitcoin stronger.

Not yet, I want to buy more!

Do you include electricity into calculations?

Lucky you!

Russian here. As long as oil and gas prices are high we don't need to innovate.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:39:44
The whole point of bitcoin - decentralized public ledger. This is fundamental difference from the way banks function. If the try to replicate something similar it will be just another altcoin.

Count me in.

Great news! See you on the Moon.:)
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:47:37
I am not sure what you mean by "premined crypto pegged to USD". You talking about changing monetary policy and making issuance of the currency algorithmic instead of directly controlled? Then again how is it better than bitcoin - having US government purely as a brand behind?
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:25:55
Well, how many altcoins out there by now? 100, 200? No one of them has succeeded to be far superior to bitcoin to  overcome its "first mover" advantage. Of course that doesn't mean that it may not happen in future. But I believe it won't be something backed by any like government and bank as we already have it - it is DollarCoin, no need to invent anything.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:19:16
I am confused too, does Bill receive cabbages?
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:47:59
Total bullshit

Just for the reference - what is current daily return per 1TH/s?

Ok, let me try to connect the dots. It seems that Mark's cat pissed on the peace of paper with the paraphrase for called storage wallet, making it blurry and hard to read. Now he is working hard with other parties to find a solution to this issue. I think it makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:04:52
Are you targeting eateries only? I wish I had something like this for my hairdresser.

Why do they need my personal details to make donations - e-mail, address, name? WTF?

A few days ago I wired money from my Commonwealth bank account to one of the Bitcoin exchanges (ozzy based), it took 20 min for money to hit the exchange. Was surprised.
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:24:06
Absolutely! Will do on my next visit. Also I've been thinking about making universal booklet for merchants. Haven't done anything yet opposite to you:)
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:10:42
Very plausible scenario.

Third party..
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:19:31
In POW there is an objective metric which differentiate one block chain from another - hashing power. I agree with the article, it is fundamental differences between trustless POW and not trustless POS.

It's a good thing - I can buy more :)

Poor comparison. 21 million ever. You can't say the same about gold.
@_date: 2019-11-16 04:48:37
The modern fiat system is so complex that I am struggling to understand - what is “Global debt”? Who is the creditor and the borrower? If theoretically speaking the debt is cancelled out as much as possible who is left liable? Is it a government, a company, an individual?
@_date: 2019-11-17 09:33:38
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:39:03
Had a thought that it might overshoot to where no one expects - 20000. Wish I knew I was right :). On the other hand when it is at 20k you think “what if it goes to 50k?”
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:07:54
So what you are trying to say is that Bitcoin ded?
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:21:01
No it’s not, I will pay 21$ for all bitcoins so you are wrong, it does have floor.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:26:24

If there back it 1:1 it’s not printing is it?

That’s it guys - bitcoin ded.

Gold using your metrics absolutely useless, however its market cap is 8 trillion dollars
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:03:53
Probably there is no such guarantee, but same is for everything else isn’t it?  
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:18:58
"Survivorship bias" as a term is not applicable in the context you infer. Better say good old, although beaten to death here, "Past performance does not guarantee future one".
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:55:48
Amount of energy spent on POW makes it unique.
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:40:26
My Monte Carlo analysis shows pretty much the same figure.

@_date: 2015-04-08 03:20:17
Excellent explanation to my intuitive feeling.
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:01:29
Very common in Australia as well
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:03:34
Yes, it is a zero sum game since crypto is not a production generating asset class.
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:38:47
It doesn’t and that’s OK.

@_date: 2015-10-31 08:37:21
Sorry mate, not going to happen that soon - to much electricity is required to secure this value. Be patient.
@_date: 2015-10-22 08:12:02
Pure rocket fuel!
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:27:36
Nice read. Another way of describing bitcoin POW is that it is a process of one way pegging of scarce physical resource (energy) to a digital token to achieve and maintain its scarcity.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:01:53
Shitcoins are still overvalued.
