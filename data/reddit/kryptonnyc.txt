If you already completed your taxes you can still go back and amend your return.

I'm not surprised at all that the longest running Bitcoin meetup is in NH. "Live Free or Die"

Good interview with Larry Sharpe where he discusses his view of cryptocurrency.

Low liquidity exists at the moment so big players can more easily cause these sharp dips and spikes by place market orders and triggering a lot of stop losses.

How ungrateful. You realize these high taxes go towards provided top quality access to healthcare and some of the best education in the world, right? Oh, wait...that's every other developed country in the world EXCEPT the US. 
I guess we pay high taxes to still have to go into massive crippling educational debt and pay ridiculously high health insurance premiums. FML.

Then it should be more of a federal audit and not at the state level (of a state in which Kraken doesn't even operate any longer). The truth of the matter is that New York made unreasonable obstacles for blockchain companies/exchanges with the NY bitlicense and was another way for them to generate revenue (i.e. exploit) blockchain and charge high fees to apply for this license. 
While you may see their response as childish, I think they did what more people should do at overbearing and aggressive government requests. They called out an unreasonable request and hopefully will set an example. I'm not saying that no regulations or oversight should exist, but it needs to be approached in a more organized global level. In the US, states often operate/regulate/license independent of one another and it makes for cumbersome and exhaustive measures for individuals/entities to obtain approval/licensure from each individual state. Particularly when each states demands it's own licensing fees.
