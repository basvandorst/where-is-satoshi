It would honestly be wise of them because mcdonalds is literally everywhere and bitcoin also being everywhere it makes perfect sense. That's why bitcoin is also appealing to people who travel a lot.
@_date: 2019-07-21 04:20:04
Yep. Anything you invest will double,triple etc... if BTC goes from 10k to 100k your investment will go up times 10. That's why the goal is usually to cost average your investment so you can stack up as much BTC as you can before things really start taking off.

You'd have to sign up to an exchange that's available in your country. Exchanges do cover most areas. You also have the option of using a bitcoin ATM, you can check if there's any in your area online I'm guessing. The last option would be buying bitcoin with cash from someone or selling something for bitcoin

The most simple to put it is just to invest whatever you can every week. Take like 30$ a week out of your paycheck and put it into BTC every week on a certain day. So you aren't constantly trying to figure out where there is a dip so you can throw extra money at it, instead you just put in some money every week and let it start adding up from that. If everyone did this since the last bull run, everyone would have made some really nice gains.

The only things that matter is development on the technology and the world economies.  
  
As long as development continues it always be in use. Depending on its usages will determine its value. If countries with unstable currencies really good benefit from bitcoin as a storage of wealth than you cant really predict the future.  
  
The community is toxic but that's most of reddit really. It should be more welcoming and educative. I truly believe development in general would be faster on things if people had more of a logical input/out as a community.

I doubt it, the CIA didn't even learn about Bitcoin until 2011 when they invited one of the main devs to interview and ask for a presentation of how bitcoin works. Satoshi tried to keep BTC within the 'nerd' community for as long as he could so they can accumulate before the big guys find out
@_date: 2019-06-20 07:15:20
So basically the Fed still has no idea what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency really is yet and there still trying to gather intelligence. Amazing how ahead of the game BTC has been all this time.  
  
But really what concerns me is the fact the CIA has known about Bitcoin since 2011, so how is it that all these agencies sound so clueless? I'd bet that the CIA has been in it since the start unless they magically fell off at a certain point.

Theres a big crackdown on crypto scams. A lot of it stems from the comment sections with a bunch of impersonators and what not. A bunch of reports keep coming through on all these crypto videos so youtube is definitely alerted.

I already made a reply towards it and you haven't though... so your just wasting time by not continuing the discussion. So you can agree with me or just move on and ignore it
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:43:59
You said nothing of importance that is subjective or proves you have objective thinking. Your just lost in your own ego.  
  
It's not even about the gladiators so I have no idea why your going backwards now instead of progressing the discussion. You still have yet to reply to me so it's ironic your mentioning "thinking objectively"  
  
Anybody can do research. You don't need to be a scientist. Scientists share the data they discover which YOU can research.
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:36:17
Wow you're arrogant as fuck. I share insight with you. I expect you to do your own research. Common sense buddy.
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:45:34
It USE to be an actual sub about bitcoin but during the fork of BCH they all scrambled to overtake that sub instead of making their own. It's honestly delusional that they are still using that sub when it's obviously deceiving. I just find it weird that they don't feel weird using a sub called BTC. Kinda strange
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:21:01
What's your point? I just shut it down as far as I understand unless I didn't get your point
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:19:13
What are you talking about though? Science can say how tall they were and what average weight and heights were based on evidence and DNA. My point is, if you don't believe it, than whats your opposition? Science shows what there diets mostly consisted of and it was barely any meat. The point is meat has nothing to do with being a big strong man that's often portrayed in the media.   
  
We don't have to base any of this on random people. We can simply base this on science and updated science shows we don't actually need meat. You get all the same proteins and amino's from plants except plants give you more of a benefit by having antitoxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits where as meat raises inflammation. Science also shows your blood is generally more clear after eating plant based food oppose to meat. The meat industry that started it's campaigning and lobbying back around the same time Big Tobacco said smoking is good for you is when people started getting into false beliefs. That's when the war on information pretty much started taking place

I'm skeptical about 5G and don't really believe it is what it's advertised. I feel that something about 5G is fake and has to do with some kind of radio frequencies that interfere with your brain.

Although that's valid I don't think he should face the death penalty.. It could be an honest mistake where he would be more than happy to put up the lights up. Definitely doesn't deserve the death penalty.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:10:00
Speaking out of your ass dude. That's speculation. And in that regard 20 years from now changes can be made to the protocol as well so again what's your point?
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:10:53
Keep spreading awareness my friend. And stay strong whenever the sheep attack. It's coming from that mind control and they don't even know it. They don't even realize they are attacking because it's their ego's coming from a triggered place and guess how that trigger was implemented into their minds? Yeah that's right, manipulation/brainwashing.
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:42:02
Thanks for clarifying that. Makes me feel better about it. In my opinion that was the incentive for him to disappear because he knew damn well they would do anything in their power to figure out who he was/is.
@_date: 2019-04-24 00:43:31
That's irrelevant. Bitcoin can always fork and break down to even more satoshis or create solutions to that. The possibilities are practically endless when you have a protocol that can constantly be updated
@_date: 2019-04-12 09:40:04
I personally feel that he is alive more so than dead. I also believe that every developer he got in touch with actually knows nothing about him or who he can be.  
  
I think Satoshi always kept things professional and never once got personal or emotional.
@_date: 2019-04-24 00:50:50
Yeah and it doesnt need to. They can create other solutions without taking away the brand. We are talking about over 100 years from now...

I think PGP is very complicated for the normies. I haven't learnt how to send PGP messages yet because I haven't looked into it enough but at one point I did briefly look into it because of some dark net interests and it definitely was more complicated than I would have thought and I do have some type of general tech knowledge such as building my own PC so for someone who doesn't have any tech knowledge at all it probably feels impossible.    
  
I think PGP needs some noob guides that explain how to do it in a very simple way. Maybe it's more noob friendly now a days, I haven't checked in a while. Just wanted to share that for some potential insight.
@_date: 2019-04-12 08:46:19
I'm pretty upset that wikileaks brought to much attention to bitcoin when Satoshi was still around. Honestly it's probably one of the reasons Satoshi had to vanish... Satoshi only stuck around for as long as he can before big agencies started to take notice like the CIA. If bitcoin was kept more underground while Satoshi was around he definitely would have stayed around couple extra years.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:31:46
But there is no difference. The protocol can adjust to that.
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:04:48
1- I did not say that.  
2- that point still stands. Obviously it would benefit others as well but it doesn't change the point.  
  
And yes you will put it in a asset like Bitcoin because it's literally the only option you have in places like that and it's a better bet than your national currency that's being inflated on some scary levels where you just know it's going to continue. In that sense there's more hope for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:40:24
But that's as of right now. Those incentives can change in 10-20 years. It changes through time. Right now the incentives seem to be fine because theres no reason for it to change right now. Are you saying that the incentives should change right now? If that's the case you can bring this discussion up with the developers to see what the consensus is
@_date: 2019-04-11 08:10:07
around 2021-2023 is when we are due for the next recession. So it depends on how the economy plays out.We never had bitcoin during a recession.
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:22:24
it's no where near worse. Every nation in the worlds wealth is owned by the top 1% of people who live there. If bitcoin truly became a world currency a lot of that wealth would be distributed to everyone who owns bitcoin and particularly it's those who live in a poverty country who need it most and they are the ones who would buy bitcoin more than some random american family.  
  
Regardless it's better than the federal reserve. The federal reserve is a private company which even has anonymous stock holders... and ironically Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest holders... There's to much power and control over politics in this field which needs to collapse. At least bitcoin offers some kind of transparency and isn't private.
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:28:12
You're wrong. You apparently know nothing about Andreas and all the tours he's been doing in places like Ecuador. Awareness has been going on for a while now and there's many peers spreading awareness to the lesser fortunate. What you makes you think you know everything about who owns bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:36:56
This is interesting because I would imagine something in this scope, Gavin would have notified Satoshi privately about meeting with the CIA before announcing it to the public and maybe asked for some advice or suggested to Satoshi that he should vanish due to the interest of top intelligent agencies.  
  
Or he never talked to Satoshi about it and just made it public and when Satoshi saw that he knew he had to vanish because Gavin will clearly give up everything he knows about Satoshi to the CIA which he obviously did but we can only hope that satoshi was a master of his craft and never left any trail that can identify who he is.
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:49:55
Just becareful. Anybody new to the space is VERY vulnerable to manipulation which you already proved by saying you heard about the bitcoin crash and how it's not worth it anymore. What about all the other crashes over the last 10 years? How come you were never told about those? Exactly... misleading information not based on any fundamentals.  
  
It's still extremely early for bitcoin.. What I suggest is educating yourself on bitcoin as much as you can so you can think for yourself.   
  
Start with Andreas, Nobody is as informational as Andreas is. He's like a bitcoin master when it comes to the technology and he's been teaching bitcoin for over 5 years   scroll as far down as you need to and find what ever videos he has that are more 'noob friendly' and you can build your way up

How is that math? Also the dark net isn't subject to crime. A lot of the dark net is a free market so that's subjective on weather it's crime or not.  
  
A fraction of each bitcoin is not involved in something like a dark net. I don't see any math that shows how it is.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:34:16
So are you implying that the bitcoin protocol cannot dilute that %? Because I'm pretty sure it can depending on if that becomes a priority
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:35:33
Looking at the top is pretty irrelevant. Your looking at the biggest investors which poor people would never compete with. Poor people are investing tens of dollars at a time compared to the rich who are investing millions. You will never notice the poor investments in this regard but it still makes a huge difference for them especially because it's usually the poor countries who have currencies dealing with heavy inflation which again would make a huge difference for them.   
  
All I'm saying is that there is ton of poor people investing throughout the world and it makes a big difference for them. Using Andreas as a reference is just to give you an idea how the word spreads without your awareness since your awareness is based on google searches. These people tell their family and friends about it and so on.
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:05:20
It can be said until proven otherwise. If there's no actual arguments based on facts than you can't say they aren't.   
  
But there is enough facts to say they are. These were Roman athletes who fought to the death. It doesn't get any tougher than that. A lot of them even had to fight through animals like Tigers and Rhino's. A lot of them were slaves and only can get freedom through a fight to death. I can say these were strongest men of that era until any valid facts would prove otherwise.  
  
For instance if you don't believe that's true. Than who do you believe were the strongest men?
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:26:28
I dont know what your even agreeing on. The protocol can be adjusted with time so what are you disagreeing with?
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:18:24
I think not. One of the only reasons the US is able to do that is because of the power they have with banks such as how banks help fund wars for them. If bitcoin really does become a threat to banks than it may very much be a worry.
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:48:15
Do you know what app it is? If you don't have the private keys I do not believe you will be able to restore it. However even a phone that doesn't turn on anymore must have a way to be fixed.  
  
You would need to speak to a professional on getting the phone fixed without destructing the data it stores. But I would do this without mentioning bitcoin but instead mentioning an important document for a lawyer case or something like that

That's non sense. Of course you have freedom. It's a natural human right. You cant argue that. But I understand what you mean that where you are born they try to dictate how much freedom you have and if you dont believe in it, you can fight for what's right if you have that type of courage. At least within the US if you lose trust in the government you can overthrow them. In other nations it depends if you think it's worth risking your life for which one can argue it is because the true fundamental of happiness is found in freedom so it's a humane nature to revel against a government that takes away freedom.
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:28:16
I think not. The US has deep ties to many countries with fiat money. I mean it's common sense really. Why do think oil is mostly traded in fiat money? They desperately been trying to make fiat money the global currency.  
Have you ever heard of economic hitmen? Watch some videos on it to see how many presidents and higherups went missing when they didn't want to get involved with fiat money.  
  
Just look at the federal reserve and how some of the biggest share holders are people like Saudi Arabia. There's obvious deep corrupt and political ties around fiat money that directly impact other parts of the world. Fiat money impacts the world more than any other currency does.

holy shit guys what a great time to be alive. I know this isn't a game changer or anything but can you believe how fast the crypto space is advancing? like cmon people use to think bitcoin is magic internet money. It's starting to be recognized as gold and in fact better than gold. This will just keep getting more and more influential to the masses until they realize they have to get on board.

It would be extremely difficult to regulate them and keep an eye on how they are keeping up to the health code. Traffic already is a huge issue, it would be much worse if vendors are placed on every block. It would also bring up other issues regarding garbage. And on top of that there's simply not enough room. They would end up posting up in front of peoples property and nobody wants that kind of congestion. It would also cause turf wars between vendors constantly fighting for the best spot because a particular location can make you a lot of money hence why certain licenses can cost up  to 300k just to keep your cart there for the year.  
  
Basically this stuff needs to have a system in order for it to work in such a populated city. But I would agree that maybe some of it's rules can be changed to allow more opportunity for vendors. Because I'm not saying I 100% agree with it all, only that I agree it should have a system in place.

The funny thing is somebody is actually getting paid to write these things... Bitcoin has been getting attacked ever since it launched! Really goes to show how strong the force is and we are a big part of it. All of our energy counts, don't ever doubt that. The power is always in the people, we just gave it away at a certain point.
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:47:34
As a newyorker you are correct. If there wasn't any rules you'd see a cart literally on every single block everywhere. It wouldn't be good for the city. Even with the very expensive licenses you still see carts pretty much everywhere.
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:26:40

Well it's pretty confusing because it is a complex technology. Even though bitcoin has been out for around 10 years majority of people including all governments know very little about it's technology and how it works.  
  
If you are interested in learning I highly suggest learning from Andreas, he wrote the book on mastering bitcoin and he's been spreading knowledge on Bitcoin for many years. He has videos that cover pretty much every topic on bitcoin.  
  
  
  
Scroll through all the videos until you find the ones your interested in learning more about
