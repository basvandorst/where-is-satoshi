2 x references in bitcoin.it wiki 
@_date: 2015-08-31 11:44:39
1 x reference in 2nd illustration title 'How a Bitcoin transaction works' 
@_date: 2015-08-31 08:03:08
Possible fringe reference ... Is the following acceptable ? (Item 5.3 - Figure 5)   
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:39:37
229.11 USD
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:58:13
.... a few examples here :) 
@_date: 2015-08-31 10:48:55
Found 1 x usage. 3rd line of introduction.  
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:30:42
Several references found from Item 2.1 onwards.

Although I am excited by this. I think the long term goal is to own &amp; control as much of the IoT as possible. 21.co are just the first out of the blocks.

I don't think 'uncopyable' is the right term to think along. I think more along the lines of 'original' or 'authentic'. The same way I can download and print a replica Picasso for very little but the originals are of course priceless.

I think this is the first of many IoT layers. We will be able to exchange across any level at any time. I don't think the new ecosystems being built will be 'flat' like an app store but will have depth and enable choice. We will be able to choose our IoT. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:58:36
And paid for not with bitcoin but with another excess utility that you control now or in the future ... I see bitcoin facilitating this exchange with the user controlling boundaries. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:25:21
Yeah. I probably could have been a little lighter here. 
The point being (I could have used better examples), as we progress with this technology it will provide an overwhelmingly positive utility by allowing self choice above what we have imagined today. 
M2M markets will open up significant new possibilities that are just not available currently. This won't just be fridges ordering themselves a refill of milk or a car booking itself a service. It will embrace every segment of our lives from our choices of what to stream to our choices on how to live. 
I believe this will be extremely positive which is why this technology to me is exciting.

Could you imagine having the choice to make a trade for a utility or service you need  when you need it and exchange any utilities or services you own that you are not using or have excess of ... in a p2p way. 
I don't know what this is today but in the future it could be your spare phone memory for a couple of parking meter minutes your car needs.

Exactly. Bitcoin facilitates that p2p exchange in a frictionless way. You need more bandwidth, great. I have some. I need more cloud storage from Storj but only for 1 hr while I migrate documents. You may not be able to help ... but some will. My hardware will link with them. I will just set the boundaries. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:54:45
Very thoughtful. The opportunities of autonomous trade within a p2p environment (m2m or p2m or whichever) with boundaries set by each user to their taste in a secure way will be immense. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:47:44
Good points. This allows you to completely avoid the issue of obtaining bitcoin to fuel these communications and circumvents the fiat currency systems. Interesting observations. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:22:40
Great write up. Thought provoking point for me is: 
'That whole Bitcoin powered internet we talked about. It doesn’t exist yet'
It's like trying to justify the existence of an iPhone app store in 1996. The utility will come. This is the first step.  
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:15:40
Perhaps. But you may also get paid (not necessarily bitcoin but something other utility you may need) for driving on the freeway in a safe manner or in a certain model vehicle for each km or allowing your gps to track you. 
These micro payments will enable the transaction of an entirely new class of value and I think switch many things on their heads. 
They will p2p, irrevocable and allow the allocation of scarcity to enable the exchange of that utility. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:46:24
Morbid, but what the heck. 
1. Exchanging my spare bandwidth for 10k more beats of my 1000k beat limit machine heart so I can see my children start school in 2 weeks. 
2. Having to trade 5 hrs of the remaining 1200 hrs of unused time my robotic eye has left of its pre-bought sight so I can open the door lock of my driverless car because another 'stress test' is taking place and my transaction is not confirming to get the damn thing open. 
Everything will be traded with everyone. You will be buying someone else's spare vision because they passed away and won't now need it or selling your spare heart beats because you have nothing left to live for. 
Note: you get the gist ... it may not all be sunshine and roses. Take care of each other kids !

I think this will also extend the opportunity of access over ownership. A utility you own you can trade for access privileges and one you don't (but may need for 20 mins) you can gain access to. 
I don't mean return to bartering but a more effective way of allocating your resources. Storj I think is one great example that will gain benefit from this.

I agree that you could pay with bitcoin but when this develops you will use bitcoin to facilitate the transaction and the exchange will be with whatever excess utility you have at your disposal. 
These excess utilities are currently things that you might not be able to currently monetise; hard drive space, band width, a song on your playlist, steam credits or any style of asset you can think of. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 07:01:23
I agree with you. This is also just the first of many iterations. Once an ecosystem starts to become apparent we will see many others jumping in or creating their own ecosystem; not everyone will want to be locked into 21.co IoT.

Really good to hear. Great work Ken !
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:42:56
Great concept !
