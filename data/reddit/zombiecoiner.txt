You're right in that a global ban is highly unlikely which is why I'm not concerned about that. I don't wish to keep the "small nodes" around because I think they provide additional security but instead because they provide more people with the means to directly observe the network and detect censorship.

To maintain the same level of miner revenue at the next block halving, 12.5 BTC would need to be paid each block in fees. Divide this by an upper bound of about 2000 transactions at 1MB, each transaction would have to include 0.00625 btc as a fee which is about a buck fifty right now. Before transaction fees get to this level, consensus would start to form around 2, 4 or 8MB blocks so that a smaller fee per transaction would suffice.
As you know, it is a balancing act between decentralization and convenience and we can make quick changes if everyone is behind it. What we should be careful of is making a change before it is truly required. FSS RBF helps reduce the noise in transaction fees and make reaching such consensus easier.

I think it would be helpful if the increase camp acknowledged that fees are what will secure the network long term and not just to pay for verification but for the hashing that must defend against attackers. To that end there will be an aspect of artificial scarcity required even if scarcity isn't driven by anti-centralization.

If fees stay the same in btc, you're right. This is definitely going to require some tuning around when the halving to 6.25 happens. 
Historically the default fee has been lowered whenever the usd value has increased past a certain point. I think it's generally been targeted to be less than $0.05 in value ([this post in 2013]( is an example where people were arguing for 0.0001 when btc was about $75). At the same time we hope the network will become more secure over time which is something you would express in dollar terms as well just because that's probably what an attacker will be spending. There are enough unknowns that we will have to decide at some point to have meaningful fees. For me, this is the time.

Bitcoin doesn't defy monetary physics. Companies that are trying to do stuff have to pay their bills or maybe they go under. It's anyone's guess, but risk is something the best part of the Bitcoin ecosphere accepts. 
We know clinging to a tenuous past is uninteresting. So we overlook minor details like 1% fees. Or having to meet an actual person to acquire coins. Or submit ID to underqualified AML lapdogs. Or risk.

To reduce the cost of transactions due to orphan risk. Each transaction, each byte really, that must be sent for a block to propagate increases orphan risk. IBLT is an idea to take it from bytes of transactions, some of which can be pretty large and previously unseen by a node, down to number of transactions or better. Reduce orphan risk and you can make blocks bigger.
Unfortunately IBLT doesn't fare well when another miner misreports results or the contents of their table.

Hens, while distributed, require no consensus. 
The Bitcoin network doesn't just need miners. It also needs users who must run Bitcoin nodes. Make that too expensive and you'll have the rest of us simply trusting miners without a way to do our own independent verification. Higher bandwidth requirements also make miner traffic easy to detect and miners easier to coerce into censorship.
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:29:58
Correct but...this assumes miner costs do not drop in BTC terms. Miner costs are usually denominated in fiat so if the price of a bitcoin goes up fees will be higher in fiat terms but lower than that in BTC. 
Some of us can remember when the default fee in bitcoind was 0.05 btc and that was cheap!

You're right. 0.0001 btc probably won't be enough. Thing is, now there are very few tools to help anyone deal with the reality that the block chain is a limited resource. A limited resource not because some people who understand the system say it is, but block chain space is limited because the trade-off between fee per transaction and centralization is very real today.
It is easy to imagine a world of destitute and desperate people trying to get their coffees paid for but instead I choose to make a distinction between transactions that benefit from being off-chain, with instant settlement and reversibility, from those that require privacy and resistance to censorship. By lumping them all together under a free/low-fee model you very well may throw out the freedom baby with the convenience bathwater.

Obviously what will happen here since block size increase takes time is that a fee market will develop and stress testing will be seen to be throwing money away to distort the fee vs. confirmation time curve. I guess we can thank stress testing for helping get things like safe RBF implemented.

There is always a trade-off involved and I would agree that a smaller increase would be an easier pill to swallow. As for when, I think when there are signs that transaction fees are driving people off the blockchain and requiring them to accept poor substitutes then that would be the time for action. As it stands, the selection of fees and handling of fee-based promotion mechanisms are too immature to say that increasing the block size is urgent and important.

@_date: 2015-06-08 07:41:35
With a limited block size and continuous demand for more transactions than can be confirmed, fees will rise to compete for that space in the block chain. You can think of it as the Bitcoin-using world holding an auction for space in the next block. If demand is high enough, the fee could rise into the dollars or tens of dollars worth of bitcoin and sometime before that you're probably not going to want to pay for a pizza with a native Bitcoin transaction.

It's not a stress test but it's not exactly real either. 2/3rds of the transactions in the last block were respends of outputs also confirmed in that block. The median fee is still 0.0001 btc so the solution is simple for anyone who wants a confirmation nao. Pay 0.00011 btc as a fee. Still cheap. Eventually the spammer will be priced out as they should be.

It's those higher value use cases that seem most vulnerable to me and that's more from censorship than transaction fees. I would be greatly concerned if Coinbase were being used to get around a $1 or $10 transaction fee because those are bargain basement prices to sell one's economic freedom for. If we get this block size wrong to the point that censorship of the blockchain, blacklisting, redlisting, whatever you want to call it becomes practical reality then Bitcoin loses its primary differentiator just to become a semi-useful payment network. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:44:51
Bitcoin's economic policy requires that greater amounts of value are transacted through it with each halving. Popularity or some particular transaction count per block are much harder to define.
Let's say it's 10 years later and we've been through three more halvings. The block subsidy is now only 3.125 btc. How many transactions do we need per block to have the same or better security for the network versus now?

There is no defending that "throw my weight around" statement. What Gavin meant was probably more along the lines of spending political capital. That he put it that way to me says he was letting some emotion enter into what should be a calculated action and statement. To this point Gavin has tended to be more cautious and apolitical. I could hear that tone on the LTB episode with Peter Todd. I think this is a case of Gavin giving Hearn a little too much audience. Lots of conjecture here to but this is what I feels in mah gut. I can't see any other reason he would risk Bitcoin's long-term security.

If their distribution were even across jurisdictions, utilizing Tor where necessary (which makes this unknowable), the for just the network's operational sake, then yes 6,000 would be enough.

7 billion transactions * an average 350 bytes per transaction = 2.3 TB/day. 
Using unreasonably cheap consumer backup hard drives this is about $27k per year just in hard drives. Realistically, you'll want some sort of storage cluster SAN to do this which will cost more. If you assume people won't spend more than 1% of their income supporting the independent bitcoin vision, you are left with people who earn more than $2.7m per year...maybe 500,000 people around the world. (guesstimating from

For me, $1 a day is significant. If I consider running Bitcoin Core to be part of the expense of using Bitcoin, I don't want free transactions if it's going to cost a lot more to run that node. If I transact once per day or so, I would prefer my costs be a split between transaction fees and hosting expenses. Already it's lopsided and a block size increase makes it even more so.

It is not a question of motivations of a good miner, who mines for profit. It is about the damage a malicious miner can cause in creating bigger blocks.

I don't worry about processing transactions. The fee situation is all about defending the network against an attacker who might build enough hash power to attack the network and destroy the consensus. Some people guess more transactions will do it while others think something will replace fees. I would like to see fees rise enough to make it clear that the network will be safe even after block subsidies go away. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:40:08
It is hard to tell if many transactions are economicallly beneficial to the sender. We also don't want those who need confirmations to be shut out of the system. The thing is, Bitcoin has a mechanism for separating the wheat from the chaff and it is fees. They provide the kind of incentive for miners that should ensure that important transactions are confirmed right away.
If you look at each block since even before the stress test, there have consistently been on the order of 100 transactions that are respending outputs that were also confirmed in the same block. Their amounts are random and the outputs are regularly recombined and it is very hard to see what economic purpose they serve. Even if they were for mixing, they're very easy to spot so aren't much use for blending in. Finally, these transactions pay a minimal fee which is not hard to pay if someone has a lot of money. It's something like $4 per block that they're spending to fill up these blocks.
The solution is already with us and that's paying slightly more than the 0.0001 btc default that these transactions are using. Wallets can use better tools to figure out what minimum fee will beat this specific set of transactions. At that point, these spam transactions will be priced out as the costs to the spammer increase to beyond their budget.
The question is what is that budget? The only way we'll find out is by pricing them out. Increasing the block size in light of these economic phantoms invites the spammer to spend the same or less to cost everyone running a full node even more. It's not something that is in anyone's interest.

The O nomenclature doesn't assume that the variables involved reach some maximum. The next step down would be O(n log n) which would require that the second term, here transactions, would only scale as the log of the number of nodes. We don't know that to be true so O( n^2 ) is probably the closest thing we have.
About who will run nodes, I would like to see anyone who wants or requires full security to be able to run one. It's fundamental for me like the right to a fair trial. Obviously not everyone in the world can run a node (just like getting a fair trail) but the block size issue strongly affects how many fewer people will be able to run a full-node over time.

Right. Bitcoin is paid to the miners to secure the network.

There are two reasons why Bitcoin will support more users than "a few million". 
One is offchain. People love to dismiss this one because it gives birth to centralized services, currently. Thing is, those services are kept honest by having Bitcoin as their currency and settlement layer.
The second is time. If fees rise to some level, thereby proving Bitcoin's economic utility as BC pointed out, consensus will build to increase capacity. I would be for an increase by 50% if fees had a dailiy average above $0.50 for a month. Conservative but reasonable.

Bitcoin has always been moon or die but that's on the long term. As Gavin said a few years ago, I believe Bitcoin will have several bubbles over its life. We've had 4 that I can recall and I imagine we'll have a couple more and the next one is setting up to be something really spectacular. The key is that we pay attention to the primary threats to the system of centralization and 51% attack. The merits of the system should continue to draw people to it over time regardless of the minor costs and inconveniences that come along with it.

A. People always want things cheaper but at some point lowballing ourselves means the network is not secure either because of PoW or centralization. 
B. It is unreasonable to think any technology can handle unlimited load. How transaction fees will really work is one of Bitcoin's unknowns. 
C. D. All hail Satoshi. 
E. Bitcoin is the foundation for a new financial system, not the entire thing. Even if you had to pay the estimated cost per transaction including funding the proof of work ($6) I believe Bitcoin's unique qualities of being a free, math-based money make it worth it.

@_date: 2015-06-02 02:42:22
Not fewer. The same or more. Bitcoin begins to gain a new value not in just being a currency for transferring value to merchants but for paying the fee to be included in the block chain. Just as the government gives the dollar value by requiring taxes be paid in it, the Bitcoin network creates demand for bitcoin by requiring that fees be paid in it. Meanwhile, we keep it easy for anyone in the world to subscribe to read that block chain. I believe those eyeballs on the chain also lend value to the network.
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:09:32
Good luck. At this point, we're lucky we can organize a new block roughly every ten minutes.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:23:22
And here we're looking at sacrificing the decentralization of the entire system just to keep fees near zero. Mind the trade-offs. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:53:17
Nobody can predict the future but a related question is how will the system secure itself if fees are never allowed to develop? During the next year we have a chance to get real data while we're early in adoption and persuasive arguments still have a chance to affect the direction of this type of policy.

IBLT makes it so new blocks don't have to come packaged with all of their transactions. Instead miners can coordinate via the lookup table and stay synchronized in theory. Apparently there's an attack that can be done that screws up IBLT's promise. Matt C's fast relay network optimizes block propagation as well but uses more conventional methods to identify what data in a block is new and what is transactions that have been seen my miners.

It's certainly no majority. When it comes to something like this block size limit, it's between consensus and unanimity, but closer to unanimity. Think 99%.
In terms of who, that's wallets, exchanges, mining pools and those who run full nodes or would for the duration of contention of a hard fork. Since everyone needs quality software to implement it, it's developers too. 
By the way, Gavin has said that he likes Jeff Garzik's proposal which represents a move toward the kind of consensus we need. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:45:27
I would agree if there were more wiggle room in the decision-making protocol but it's going to boil down to the network going a specific way recorded for all eternity. Best I can do is try to balance versus what I feel was an uncharacteristically hasty campaign for block size increase. As a voice of reason how do you think the network will grow in security and maintain decentralization as the block reward fades away over the next decade?

Because if there were no limit a malicious miner could make a huge block to bloat the blockchain and increase costs for everyone. Someone could still be doing it with lots of spam transactions and some alts have seen this kind of attack but a block size limit at least places a throttle on that threat.

Nobody's going to break the functionality of paper wallets. It may cost you a little more to fund/redeem them but they will always be with us. 
Think of it this way. A paper wallet with a good password is like a vault made of math, but that vault depends on the network being secure and uncensorable to function. Any fees you pay to fund and redeem along with losses due to monetary inflation (miners making more BTC available) must go to pay for those two features of the network.

There are different kinds of centralization.

The process is you would help him sign up using his email address. He'll get a verification email to click on. Then he'll need to link a bank account. This can done one of two ways at  under Add A Bank Account. He'd probably be most comfortable with the one where he enters in his checking account number and the routing number for his bank (both shown on one of his checks) and a couple small deposits are made to his account. Once he sees the deposits in his checking account he can log back into Coinbase and verify the bank account with those amounts.
The other thing is to enable the instant cash out. That can be done at  by setting a few things in the Payouts section. After that, you just have to get one of his addresses from his  and you'll be good to go.

I think he made one error for sure by being impolite when people asked about the donations moving. The second thing he did that may have created the whole issue is to use Coinbase to accept the funds. Coinbase and many other wallets/exchanges combine and move funds around sometimes right after deposit. 
If you are collecting donations, it's better to create one address that you fully control. Then when the time comes to sell some (it's optional telling people what you're doing anyway but always be polite if people ask), you move it to an exchange or Coinbase. Best of luck to you! I think if you mention that any Bitcoin donations will not move for X hours/days after they are sent,, and you are polite answering questions, you should have little problem giving away the pizzas.

The current price quote is hard to justify when those coins will be released over decades. It'll likely be far more than $4B when all is said and done.

I also do not like "this has been discussed many times before" as a response. It is challenging however to explain again and again what the product of said discussion was. Bitcoin is decentralized so there will be no official statement about why any of these is not a problem. In regards to  Bitcoin's design is not meant to operate on the second and sub-second timescale. It is better used as a backbone to support many offchain (possibly centralized systems) while always keeping open that a user can transact on the main network if they're willing to pay the necessary fee and wait the necessary amount of time for a tx to clear.

The only thing in bitcoin that Coinbase should interact with is your own wallet. After it gets to your wallet, you can send it to yourself one more time and at that point, they shouldn't have any idea who's sending what where. If you're sending into Coinbase, again it should go through your own wallet (or a wallet you control just for use with them) for at least a hop or two.

It's fine to just post an address. For privacy, you can change it each time you get a donation. For the security side (which is really not a big issue unless you are concerned about ECDSA getting broken), you'll want to change the address when you spend the funds from it. At that time it would also be best to make sure you move all of the money held by that address to another address.

Otherwise, continue with whatever works best for you.

As Mike said one term in scalability is the number of nodes and the other is number of transactions. It doesn't matter which one increases or decreases more with growth of the system.

While difficulty will indeed stabilize barring some advances in chip efficiency, I'm not sure about the theory that the investments that were going into mining hardware will turn around and go into buying BTC directly. Mining difficulty was fairly stable for 18 months after the 2011 bubble and it took that long until another serious rise came up. There was also a mining reward halving toward the end of that period as well.

What does it mean for banks to get ahold of Bitcoin? On the one hand, it means people might be able to transact from their FDIC-insured bank accounts directly onto the Bitcoin network. On the other hand, it means each of those payments would be tracked and would have comply with whatever the regulatory regime is. Bitcoin will always be mixable and carry with it the risk of theft. This means regulations are by definition less powerful than in the current USD space. Who knows? Maybe Bitcoin's presence will make things like the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Acts that demand full identification of every participant obsolete enough to have them repealed as useless at best and dangerous at worst.

Mining isn't a dead game but it is highly highly competitive. At some point the technology of the mining chips themselves will slow down and other factors in a mining operation will matter more (i.e. cheap power and cooling, cheap rent, low taxes).
In regards to everyone mining, that would start to happen once tech advances have slowed. It would mean that casual users at home may mine at a slight loss. Like it could cost them $5 in a electricity a month to make $3 in bitcoin. Thing is, the total number of bitcoins ever isn't going to go up and the amount introduced daily due to mining is going to decrease.
If there is a threat to the exchange rate of bitcoins, it isn't from mining but from a bad bug in the software or the coordinated banning of bitcoins by major governments around the world.

My point wasn't that I'm hiring or giving away free money. If you have scammed or are thinking about scamming others, I simply want to appeal to that part of you that does not do these things. Spend more time thinking about how we can help us all, not how we can help ourselves. I understand that some people are really at their wits end but with the right frame of mind, they can get back to building something that makes money not at others expense but by satisfying a need they have. 
That being said, I've not been impressed by the amounts stolen in most of these scams. If you need $500 or $5000, it's not hard to get if you have a strong vision for creating something. After you raise the money, you might just find that you enjoy building that thing.

It's honestly tough to rely on market research with something as new as Bitcoin. A lot of institutions one might trust to provide such research also have a strong connection with an industry that stands to be disrupted. Even if they don't, trust in traditional institutions is eroding so people have to do their own research. 
That being said, I've been impressed by certain reports from the FBI, Citigroup and others so there's probably less to fear from malfeasance than one would think. I think those of us who have done the research for years, have come to the conclusion that it is hard to get unbiased info. There are also many voices that would prefer to keep people in gold or silver or USD and don't show much restraint...so we get excited too. We say it's goin to $10k, hodl, etc. sometimes as a reply to that. Maybe you'd like to balance it back the other way.


As you acknowledge, the Bitcoin user base is not a monolith. It's always debatable whether technology can or should be a political statement but it attracts who it does. There are many viewpoints to consider and if something rings true to you that you never read before that's a net positive. I never understood so much about the power of currency and how it can be abused before Bitcoin. At the same time, our governments can hopefully become more transparent with Bitcoin's rise.


In regards to Satoshi,  most of us think those coins will never move and some are willing to bet substantial sums on this. Many early adopters didn't keep their coins and those that did, realize the value, and I believe they're in it for the right reasons. Maybe some will go mental and dump in a huge way but I think we'd recover and be that much stronger for it. Overalll, if this were a larger concern, Litecoin would probably take over as its network is virtually the same and more people were around for its launch.
Bitcoin is such a leap beyond what came before that I can't personally bring myself to believe it's a scam. The probability that a scammer would produce something so revolutionary and technically beautiful has got to be astronomically low. I'm imagining a street hustler selling DVDs coming up with the theory of relativity and painting the Mona Lisa.
What I would like to see is more emphasis around here on how Bitcoin can change the world for the better (not just make some people insanely rich), what impediments there might be to that, and what we can do to ensure all of us receive maximum benefit from this innovation.

An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a security that may hold other securities or assets such as Gold, silver, mortgages, or other stocks and funds. These are traded on the largest global exchanges like Nasdaq, NYSE, etc where securities worth trillions of dollars are traded each day.
If you are a traditional or institutional investor and wish to speculate on Bitcoin, trading an ETF through your stock trading account is a lot easier than going to a more niche Bitcoin exchange. By holding shares of the ETF, you don't have to worry about securing your bitcoins or setting up a wallet. You just login to your brokerage account and buy or sell just like any other stock.
So this makes it easier for investors to buy into the Bitcoin phenomenon and many here obviously hope this will lead to a massive increase in the price of a bitcoin since there is so much money that can easily make a purchase. It could also make it easier for those with obscene amounts of money to manipulate the bitcoin exchange rate so only time will tell.

To be clear, I wasn't talking about the app, just the trading reputation system. 5 stars that are too easy to get is a "poorer wheel" (sorry for the bad analogy) than the usual # of trades, % positive feedback, amount transacted statistics.

Given that OP used 160 bits, they are taking this into account. The ECDSA public key is first hashed down to 256 bits then down to 160 bits with RIPEMD-160. If OP had used numbers based on 256 bits then your point would be more relevant. Good thing to point out though because it gives a chance to understand why reuse is bad. Namely because that 160 bit hash is purposely compromised when funds are spent from an address because the public key hash must be published at that time.

It's called escheatment usually. If you are holding property for a customer and they disappear, in many states you must hand over such property to the state where the customer may later claim it. I always wondered how this works in the case of a self-storage facility. It is not without cost to hold and protect customer funds and with storage, they usually auction it off if you don't pay your rent.

Simplest answer is that people don't usually store bitcoin in Wordpress. This means it's not attacked that aggressively and even still it gets hacked a lot. This is because people don't upgrade *and* using it to make a web server do naughty things has value in and of itself.

It takes not just a sweep but several confirmations  to fully trust the funds on a paper wallet. Essentially in that scenario you are trusting the issuer until the game is over and in that case you're better off just using chips and settling up in btc/cash at the end. It would be fun though.

The idea of backing would mean you couod trade a share of the ETF to the issuer in return for the thing they are holding (i.e. The bitcoins) and that's not how this works. For each share they issue they are however supposed to hold those bitcoins for as long as those shares exist. Maybe later they would buy back shares and sell the bitcoins to regain their dollars but that would not be expected unless Bitcoin majorly ate it. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:21:51

A little, but it would also mean that not that many people have started to use it. So in that sense, it would be stagnation which for a new technology is like death. As unlikely as the moon ($2k) or sub-$100 are, I find them more likely than your scenario.

The client does not do automatic updates of any sort. Each node must be updated manually which gives each user a chance to look at what they are updating to. Since money is involved the calculus is that users are more motivated to be aware of what they are doing than with a game or something.

Of course they should allow you to withdraw the BTC sooner or later but credit cards can be charged back months after a sale is made. Many strategies have been devised to make such theft less attractive. Holding the BTC for 30 days or more is one of the more effective, the theory being you give victims of CC theft a chance to check their statement and dispute the charge before releasing the BTC. Hang around a while and you'll see why withdrawal is an important test of any CC to BTC service.

As long as they have the funds to stay solvent, this could work out really well for them. They are taking on quite a bit of security and volatility risk though.

We often go off-topic here because we fancy ourselves the leaders of a new world but to your other point....
There are people pursuing all strategies. While some try to fight in the courts to lessen the adverse impacts of copyright, others see technology as the solution. Code is law and all of that. Many mistrust the legal process thinking that Disney and other large rights holders have captured the regulators. What has been most effective for culture itself has probably been the technology effort. 
There are no large interests fighting for the side of sharing. I don't see Disney opening up a culture incubator or copyright-free zone. Maybe once they loosen the grip there will be more cooperative progress. Until then, the predominant frame is going to be copyright versus kopimi and people will choose which side their on.

There is a person on the other end who ultimately wants attention. If you're like most people, you read comments sorted by best and you check out the best first. Then to get a sense of the spectrum you may check out the worst as well and these comments are the best at inciting a downvote, nothing more. Downvotes are attention too. I'm saying bring the dimension of thoughtful dialog back as preferable to a downvote. If no comment goes unanswered, if people are given the benefit of the doubt, if each comment is read with a mind looking for the kernel of wisdom either in it or in what motivated it, we can elevate discussion here.

We should probably use this opportunity to warn people to be skeptical and do their own due diligence when it comes to any sort of new offering. Personally, I'm taken aback by the lack of working code and the pre-sale of a coin. There are plenty of people who will privately fund a project with Ethereum's stated goals IF they see some results. That they've gone IPO with this Ether pre-sale is a bit unsettling. So be warned. Be skeptical. Let this not be the next story of a scam that laypeople hear about Bitcoin.

To win once a week solo mining with the same odds as winning the $10k prize I calculate 188 kh. Will show work later. 
Edit: 2^32 * current difficulty of 17164305969.7816 = 7.37 *10^19 hashes to find a block. Divide that by number of seconds in a week (7 * 86400) to get average hash rate to find a block = 1.21 *10^14 or 121 TH. Then divide by chances to win $10k (1 in 648 million) to get 188 kilohashes / second. Was off by a factor of ten or so before.

By definition consensus requires a majority. If the parties are sufficiently interested, they'll mine and make obtaining a majority more difficulty for the attacker. I'm still not hearing about a more efficient solution that doesn't require a central authority.
Here's one voting scenario. Choose someone to set up the vote and have that person send 0.0002 btc to each participant's Bitcoin address in a single transaction. Then create a Bitcoin address for each color that is nominated. Then publish the list of colors and bitcoin addresses and have those 101 spend the 0.0002 btc they received by sending 0.0001 (and using the other 0.0001 btc for the miner's fee) to the bitcoin address for their color of choice. Once a choice is made, everyone will be able to see it by examining the blockchain. Nobody who isn't in the group can vote because they weren't able to spend the initially distributed coins.

I used to think it was a conspiracy by the miners just to keep the hash rate low because the competition is fierce. While that is true to an extent, mining really doesn't work out for tons of people especially when the hash rate is increasing by leaps and bounds. To do well you mostly have to wait until the hash rate levels up and buy second hand hardware and have cheap power.

In Mycelium, you can import the private key but it looks like it needs to be placed in your clipboard first. To do that, try to find a memo or note app on your phone to type the private key into. Then copy the private key from that memo app into the phone's clipboard. 
At that point you should be able to go in Mycelium and go to Accounts, then click the key icon with a plus in the upper right. Hit Advanced and then it should let you copy the private key from the clipboard.

Entities can't sell more Bitcoin than they hold or can borrow so the authenticity of the price rests mainly on the solvency of exchanges. It's natural that after such a massive run-up there will be adjustment and as we saw in 2012, it can take a while. The pace is quickening though and any number of things could spark another rise. It's not about one or a few people opening the floodgates. It's about the water topping the dam. Whether it undercuts it and dam fails drowning all those below in cash....hmm...I'm not sure about this metaphor. Time to jump ship.
Anyway, don't think of it all as so orchestrated. Eventually something will cause a lot of people to decide buying Bitcoin is the thing to do again. Can't say when that might be.

Stealing the money is a crime as is murder. The problem with money laundering as a standalone crime is that it criminalizes financial privacy which is a key component to privacy in general. Law enforcement should catch criminals but should not use real crimes as a pretense to obtain information about all citizens. Why? Because history has shown that a government that knows everything about its citizens will abuse that knowledge. 
Have you not been paying attention? The government has 1.5 million people in its list of terrorists. People get hauled off to prisons outside of the rule of law and they get tortured by what we considered to be the most honest governments in the world. Exactly what kind of world do you want to live in?

I can't see that as correcting OP as it seems more like confirming his suspicion by explaining where you think the aforementioned problem started. Satoshi mentioned what would likely happen but he didn't change his design. I attribute this to him thinking (so far correctly) that the system would survive some level of centralization or that he had no way to fix it at that time. 
Knowing that the software had a long way to go after his release, he may have assumed that if Bitcoin were successful enough to become critical economic infrastructure *and* it was possible to improve the system against centralization, that a solution would be found. A solution to Bitcoin's centralization would be a lot less likely to be found if the system were never put in motion.

The stability does not have any rhyme or reason to it. If Bitcoin will be successful, you will see it go to thousands of dollars per coin and if not, it will go closer to zero. Either way it will not be quiet and coordinated. No individual, company, or group holds enough coins to ensure a smooth transition.
Imagine, there may be a whale who is willing to buy as many coins as possible under $470 but where would that whale go if there was a flash crash to $430? I'm sure they wouldn't pump it back to $470 just to accumulate. Perhaps they would buy though if the price became too low...like as in damaging (if that is possible) to Bitcoin's reputation.

Personally, I've not been met with that kind of nervousness but people brought up Mt.Gox losing tons of money to me and I leave it there.

The effects I can see from inflation:
* Increased speed of mechanization of factories. It makes more sense to take out a loan and purchase robots than to risk having to pay tons in wages in the future.
* Savers and retired persons must work to survive. Their savings and fixed or under-adjusting incomes provide less value vs. ongoing expenses.
* Hard asset values will increase faster than the pace of inflation as value is transferred to scarce assets.
It's not just about wages.

In the US, your best bet is probably to use Coinbase. You create an account there, link it to your bank account (they make a couple small deposits or you can login to your online banking account through them), then send the bitcoins to your Coinbase account, and sell for USD. When sold, it automatically gets sent to your bank account. It should cost about 1% in fees and take about a week to do the whole process. 
After that point, you'll be ready to go to buy and sell small amounts of Bitcoin at any time using money in your bank account.

If you have Electrum you're almost there. To export the private key from the full client (Bitcoin Core):
    launch your bitcoin client as usual and wait for it to load the blockchain and start up
    click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
    click on 'debug window'
    select the 'console' tab
    type: dumpprivkey 1YourBitcoinAddress
Where 1YourBitcoinAddress is the address that the funds were sent to. You'll then see a private key which is longer than an address and starts with a number. Copy that entire thing over to Electrum and import it there. I'm not familiar with Electrum enough to say exactly how to proceed.
Having the private key to the address holding the funds is a significant step in getting where you want to go. 
Another option is this is all going to be quick and dirty is to skip Electrum and go to   create a new wallet there, and import the address (not sweep) using the advanced section of your new wallet there. You'll then be able to forward the btc to the destination immediately using the send tab in the blockchain.info wallet.

Companies try to charge something close to the expected value they will mine.  The market for mining is competitive yet profit motivated in a rather grueling way.

The TV comparison is silly because, as you point out, there is no fixed supply of televisions while the amount of BTC released per day will dwindle to zero. That means there will be decades where less BTC is mined than in a single day today.
You can look at trading volume vs. amount mined per day over time and you'll see that newly mined coins only can have a significant impact during times of low volume.
The other effect is that during a bubble, miners tend hold like everyone else so the supply can be amazingly constricted during those times.

No, each reward halving for Dogecoin has led to decreased profitability vs other scrypt coins which has led to decreased hashrate and security. Now they're merge mined so hashrate may be less of an issue. Also, both SHA256 and Scrypt are dominated by different ASICs so you're right in that it's less of an effect except in planning on new mining hw.

So yes it helps in making sure that the wallet can handle more than one address. But it is still vulnerable in so far as a relatively small number of unspent outputs would exist on the device. If one wanted to have better privacy about just how much is on the device, they should fund it with multiple payments of different sizes so the wallet can choose.
Really for this use case, the best defence is probably not having more in your mobile wallet than you'd be comfortable carrying around in cash. If you pull out a $20 bill for a coffee and those around you can see you have several bills, they can make a similar calculation.

Just because fees on withdrawals appear not to be enough for them to build a sustainable business now, that doesn't mean they can't find other ways besides selling our data to become profitable. People have recommended they refer folks to other services and it's easy to imagine those direct referrals could add substantially to their income. 
The other thing about the privacy argument is that it has little to do with profitability. If a government knows you use their service and wants more data on your Bitcoin dealings they can easily subpoena the service for the information. In that case, it's about any kind of centralized service that you use to transact bitcoin.... reddit, Coinbase, or whomever.

Basically all wallets store history and all of their addresses by default forever. A good POS app will have a mode that does not offer access to the history and address information except maybe for the addresses that have been generated but not yet received any funds. I did forget to mention as part of the privacy thing, that the wallet should have its data cleared every so often so the thief only gets as much historical payment data as the the hostel owner is willing to risk.
HD wallets help with the root cause for concern in my scenario which is other users leaking information about their finances via the block chain so it's great to hear Mycelium has them in 2.0.

This thread points out how hard it is to compute securely with anything that you can buy at a store. Blockchain.info's wallet is a popular service so naturally is involved in many thefts. I think people should focus on the basics. Strong local computer security by using Linux and a good understanding of what a strong password looks like. 2fa is over-recommended and does not fix things when those first two are not taken care of.

I'm assuming that you want to maintain privacy so shouldn't use a single address or an HD wallet that might get stolen and give guests insights into each other's finances. I'll also assume you don't want to setup a computer just for this. Then, I would choose Mycelium on an Android device. You can create and use multiple addresses in it and can make backups. I would probably take the time once a month to generate 10 addresses and do backups. Then after each is used, send the funds to your safer/paper wallet and archive the address.

Thousands, yes. Tens of thousands, possibly. Millions, no way.
You can lose your money in a US Bank in many other ways that are also really no fault of your own. For example, maybe you were structuring cash deposits because an ignorant teller, accountant or consultant advised you to do so to save money or reduce work for banks.
What we're seeing here is a massive response to a numerically small issue on the grand scheme of things. Perhaps the authorities see the potential for this to get quickly out of hand but by overreacting themselves, they are just pushing the state of the art on privacy, encryption, and decentralization.

Actually, the 10 minutes is set by the mining difficulty. If it's 8 minutes that just means more hashrate has come online since the last difficulty change(every 2016 blocks).
The block size issue is different and can be a bottleneck. Necessary fees to get into a block might just go up as well forcing smaller transactions into off-chain systems like Coinbase or inside exchange wallets(vouchers).
Days destroyed is about how long coins have been sitting. If 1 coin has sat for one day and it's spent, one day is destroyed. It is only roughly proportional to block count as there is some variance in how often blocks are found.
As a node operator, you shouldn't care about the hashrate. You just want to make sure you have good bandwidth and possibly that you're not letting a small ip address space use up all of your connections.

People are free to flood the network with transactions today but RBF would provide a mechanism for users to prioritize their transactions in the face of congestion. Once a replacement transaction has been mined, the stagnant one(s) could be dropped from the memory pool and would no longer be relayed. It would increase bandwidth used at whatever block size but would enable the fee market to function no matter what that size is versus transactional demand.

Ok I'll do an example and you can tweak the numbers. Take half what you paid for the laptop and divide it by 4. Then assuming you deliver every week, add the cost of your time at $20/hr to deliver the data. This is how much you should charge per week. Divide that by how many gigs you expect to produce in a week. So for example, you could make ~300gb of data in a week. Your laptop costs $600. It takes you 2 hours to deliver the data. $600/2/4 = $75+2*$20 = $115/300gb = $0.35/gb.

Obviously we don't need Bitcoin to reach consensus on mathematical truths or on small scale, highly localized problems like where to eat. You could still use a blockchain to reach concensus on those but there is overhead in the blockchain-based solution so that efficiency only comes into play once you get to a certain number of participants, actions, and geographical distribution. For the Internet, where millions or billions of people around the world may wish to know if Alice sent Bob some money or whether a certain document existed at a certain point in time Bitcoin provides the most efficient solution that doesn't depend on a central authority.

You bring up a new idea here in that at some point, running a node will be strictly a commercial endeavor. I don't know if that should be true. I suppose it could become true even at 1MB, it would be a shame though. On the other hand, it is a real question how increasing confirmation times might affect adoption. So far I haven't seen an alt capitalize whatsoever on this debate or even when transaction times have been long. There isn't anything else like the block chain out there so I don't think there can be a serious alternative that isn't an alt. It might be interesting to do more research on alt price vs. btc confirmation times.

1. While people are doing 0-confirmation transactions now, Bitcoin wasn't designed to natively settle such fast transactions. The way this should play out is that many other systems (centralized or not) will take care of these fast transactions and Bitcoin will be used as a backbone to periodically settle aggregated payments between them. A proposal called Replace-by-fee would completely destroy the 0-confirmation use case and would reduce confusion. That's why some want to see that happen even though it takes away the practically of practice of doing 0-confirmation transactions now.
2. The network is expected to support itself using transactions fees more and more as time goes on. This depends obviously on the value of transaction fees going up over time to meet or exceed the amounts "spent" today on mining fees and block rewards. Whether this will be enough to fend of attackers is an open question but it is expected that decades on when this becomes a pressing issue, either the value transacted in Bitcoin will be much higher or more powerful entities (like governments) who are not directly dependent on the Bitcoin system for sustenance will support it.
3. Gavin's latest thought may help with this but in general this problem is usually overstated by comparing to the worst case of Visa transactions at peak and assuming no growth in communications and computing technology until Bitcoin would run into these barriers. Storage will get cheaper, processing power will get cheaper, Bitcoin transactions individually will not get much bigger or more computationally intensive. The smartest people in the planet will be working on this so I also believe adaptation will occur to eliminate any scaling problems.
4. Definitely not content with this but when mining difficulty is in flux as it is now(it won't always be) people tend to centralize on wherever gets the most blocks and can make sure they get paid *this* difficulty period. As difficulty levels off after ASIC technology reaches some hard barriers, things should get better. Long term we should have a goal of a hash rate distribution that makes it so even 5-10 pools can get together to gain more than 51% of hashing power. Finally, I put a lot of faith in people's ability to switch pools when anything smells bad and also on the incentives built into the Bitcoin system that keep miners, hodlers, and users interests aligned.

Decentralization purists are in the minority but that's not to say that decentralization does not provide the essential foundation to what goes on here. Centralized services can be faster and more efficient so they will be with us as long as speed and cost are factors. Take away the decentralized core however and the whole system would devolve into a copy of what has failed so many times before.

The consultant's incentive to increase adoption has much to do with how many BTC they are holding. Perhaps they don't have many BTC and are using this as an angle to get attention here. Thing is, if they are cold calling, attention here isn't the end all be all of their sales pipeline.

What's fun about this is, now you've seen that the limit isn't 1mb but 750k and let's see just how many miners give you that more modest 33% increase. Stress test = more demand.

Average people may not be able to make the switch from fiat to Bitcoin. They may just die out and be replaced by new generations for whom the benefits have always been obvious. It's like kids today with their Snapchats and their Instagrams. 
That being said, people who are singled-out or abused by the current financial system already have an outlet in Bitcoin.

There is no working alternative but to be fair 20mb blocks can't be considered to be working yet as there is a lot of code to test inside and outside Core before the first larger block might be seen.
So in the space of alternative ideas, one is replace-by-fee (RBF), which would allow senders to detect if their transaction hasn't been included as quickly as they'd like and broadcast another transaction with a higher fee. The first iteration of this idea conflicted with a world where zero-confirmation transactions were trusted whatsoever. The current thought on RBF would be compatible and might empower a proper market for transaction fees.
Another idea might be to put some elasticity in block sizes so if some metric increases (days destroyed, average fee, average transactions per block) either in the current mempool or in some set of previous blocks, then more transactions would be temporarily allowed.
The other alternative is the status quo, realizing that off-chain transactions are cheaper and faster and will grow to fill in where Bitcoin transactions are too costly. In this scenario, Bitcoin is the central settlement network between those services, remains uncensorable, and can be directly accessed by those willing to pay the fee.
There may be others but these are the ones I could think of and have seen over the past few days.
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:12:00
I like zeroconf so this is painful to consider but RBF would start to make the memory pool look a lot more like an order book. There's something elegant about that.

There is a speculative aspect to mining but there are also a great many miners who have yet to get ROI. Even if they have broken even or better in USD terms, they may be lamenting that they haven't in BTC terms. So I think people will mine even at a slight loss with respect to just the electricity expense until they are made whole in BTC. 
After that point, strength of mining is more dependent on the price staying high. So far, we've never had the chance to find out which you could consider as some sort of second-order speculation. That is, whether Bitcoin will prove its usefulness to humanity long term.
Bitcoin's cost of production basically tracks its exchange rate so I wouldn't count on the cost to mine to support the price. It's going to be utility and scarcity that will be responsible for Bitcoin's success or failure.

Mainly relay rules. To generate a lot of spam, you'll either have to have a substantial amount of btc to put into those transactions or be willing to pay high fees to have transactions relayed. Relay rules don't have to change with block size but if you're going to get 20k transactions into the memory pool from today's legitimate users, it would have to become cheaper...like the dust limit would have to be decreased or I think the priority calculation would need to ease.

They also generate a ton of transactions themselves. Ever trace a deposit there? It almost looks like they're behaving close to fully transparent for ... someone. If the block size isn't increased, they have some coin-handling code to update which may or may not be a comfortable thought. Anyway, they pay their fees so as long as minimal fees work, they're ok.

This device is responsible for signing a transaction and nothing more. That makes it something that needs other software to get you up to that point in the payment process for it to work. The simplest example is going to Overstock and ordering a pair of socks  then when it asks you to send payment you go to your wallet, fill in the address and amount, and a transaction is prepared by your wallet that is sent to and signed by this device. 
That being said, this level of security is probably not needed for low value everyday shopping and you probably wouldn't want this device to be seen in public. So mostly this is good for people who want to store their savings or what would otherwise be known as cold storage in a more convenient and secure way.

It's probably best to view this situation from the perspective of the Bitcoin network. It cares not about core developers or commit access. It's all about what rules are being enforced by a majority of the network. Who is a core developer and what repos they have commit access to are just operational details that affect those rules.

I'd go even further: It goes beyond financial transactions and extends to serve any observation we (or machines) can express. Bitcoin redefines truth as a timestamped hash bound to an observation. 
This existed then.
Compare with the next best thing. The same data, though modifiable, in multiple centralized locations with no clear source of authority.
The block chain provides a commons where "this existed then" is made available to everyone. We like money, and for it to function there must be some way to track it but there's a slight chance that, greater benefit will come from being able to trust the existence of observations about data, communications, current events, and yes of course, property.

Who can't afford a transaction? The minimum fee to get included in the next block is 0.0001 or $0.024.
Your bandwidth estimate leaves out the effect of a connection being saturated by outbound traffic and ignores the current duplication between maintaining the memory pool and downloading blocks. So if you're on DSL, you might be out of the game at 20MB. Then to run a full-node with storage, that's $18 a month now, becoming impossibly expensive during the next year or so when a 1TB block chain is reached.

The implication is that accepting Bitcoin is potentially dangerous to other Imgur users? Like digging a hole and leaving it may just enable someone to fall and hurt themselves? Or are you thinking more like, this is doing work for no purpose. If one person can support Imgur with a donation who otherwise would have had a hard time using Paypal/VISA/SWIFT, wouldn't that give the integration effort some purpose?
Oftentimes, we Bitcoin users want organizations to accept Bitcoin really to advertise the currency we support ourselves. That doesn't mean it is without value. At some point in the future the hope is that businesses who accepted Bitcoin because of some email campaign or shaming will actually benefit from it. Perhaps they'll accept it and forget about it and it'll pay their hosting one month when in a pinch they go check their btc address. Or maybe they'll just attract a Bitcoin user who will then tell friends to patronize that business.
I wish you luck in what you're trying to do but Bitcoin isn't going to go away because you wish it would. It's like asking the Internet to go away.

First, let's not set unreasonable expectations. Nothing works perfectly. Secondly and more importantly, the amount of value stored in Bitcoin very much matters as to what kind of transactions can be carried out using it. To have enough liquidity to absorb larger money flows ($10-100m even) the price must be high, and much higher than it is now.

that the reliability of the network (from the average user perspective)
There is no such thing as a free lunch. OP fails to mention that the network will need to secure itself with transaction fees eventually. Those fees must not only pay for the incremental cost of processing and storing a transaction but for the security of the network as a whole. The fees will have to pay not just for a few hashes per transaction, but for all the hashes executed to find blocks. I think we have to be careful about low-balling the value of this network and it's better to confront the reality of this limited resource than to "kick the can". Users should not expect free and they probably shouldn't expect to get into the next block. As long as their transaction gets in within the next few blocks or they have a mechanism to promote their transaction, the system works.
It bothers me somewhat that fees seem like they need active management with the current state of things and our best tool has a 1 year lead time.


limit of 7 tps makes them uncomfortable that they are going to invest
all this time into a system that has no chance of handling the economic
activity that they expect it handle.
I would expect nothing less from corporate interests than to guide the system toward pricing out individual involvement. It's economic embrace and extend. IMHO, it's better for them to build their bloat into their own databases than to inflate the world's public ledger.
Probably the best idea I've had about this whole thing is in relation to costs that go to fees vs. running a full node, a ratio with greatly depends on how often someone transacts. If anyone's interested, I'll make a post about it specifically because I think committing people to store lots of data in a high-availability environment forever greatly overshadows a few cents or even a few dollars for a transaction fee that might be incurred once a week or month.

Besides the potential lock-in and control there are some things they can simplify by not giving you private keys.

The alternative also has its costs. I'm not sure about the inefficiency argument. Try as I might, it's very hard to do an apples to apples comparison with traditional payment networks. The Bitcoin network doesn't have to market itself or put on trade shows or run highly secure data centers. At the same it, it is payment(and other kinds of asset transfer) without censorship. The world may lose something supporting Bitcoin due to inefficiency but gain otherwise through the robustness of the protocol and network.

20mb blocks bring the average bandwidth to 33kb/s just to keep up with blocks. I'm afraid this may stress some slower dsl connections.

It comes down to why they need a bank in the first place. Banks provide security for your money but unfortunately are rife with reversibility which therefore necessitates credit. A Bitcoin bank could secure ones funds without the need for credit. 
The other thing someone might need a bank account is to accept checks and USD deposits. If they know they can be paid in Bitcoin through some work on the sender's part, that would be a good start in removing the need to accept checks and USD. Then Bitcoin ATMs that dispense cash would be their banking branch. I believe this is actually a big part of Robocoin's plan. A nice add-on for them would be Locks from Coinapult.

In the absence of the word Bitcoin appearing there and perhaps even a stronger statement, it is reasonable to think that a new coin could be launched that would be tailor-made for a specific hardware stack. In the case of a mobile network, it is conceivable that mining could be a join effort between cell towers and mobile devices. To mine a block for example might require some random data from a cell connection that a carrier's mining node can verify independently from what the mobile device might share. This would only become interesting if a standard is created that many mobile carriers would adopt. Short of that, it's just a centralized and over-complicated form of spam control.
Since the above is quite far-fetched, I'm happy to withhold judgement until we see the product line.

Sending to fees would not be burning since those coins will still be in circulation. You could easily create an eater address or a hash to send to for which the conditions to unlock coins sent there are unknown. An eater address would make the burn clearer but if the coins are out of circulation, the effect is the same.

@_date: 2015-05-05 06:52:27
This has much to do with where in new mining technology rollout we are. Whenever a new technology comes out and causes great hashrate increases, mining tends to get centralized because economically those with the new faster equipment want to be sure they get a piece of as many blocks as possible in each difficulty period. Later as hashrate increases slow down, that incentive disappears and miners then are more driven by whatever pool has lower fees, longevity, security, trustworthiness, or policies they agree with.

The mining network can technically operate on one miner with a CPU. What matters is the hash rate versus what an attacker could muster and we're not out of the woods yet when it comes to state-level attackers. We know the network will need to survive moreso on fees as time goes by but that today's fees are far below the point of parity with the block reward. Raising the block size increases supply of an already cheap good.
Why not allow block sizes to grow if the average fee per kB grows? Perhaps a 1 MB limit with above average fees/kB enabling the block to accommodate additional storage.
Replace by fee is another option.
Of course, any solution needs code and critical-level testing so we should find a way to fund each possibility.

If you try and make them have more, they'll just generate more to meet the quota. When Bitcoin started there weren't any transactions for hundreds of blocks at a time.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:16:05
Because when the block size gets bigger, those with money have more leverage over an important leg of Bitcoin's consensus: running full nodes, choosing relay rules, and providing APIs to those who can't run a node. 
As for cost, with 20mb blocks, I would expect a 1 tb block chain within a couple years. Storage will get cheaper but I would still expect that to cost more than $100/mo for a hosted server. Then in terms of bandwidth you probably need 10mbps or better to keep up. 
Compare that cost with what transaction fees bring in for miners and you have a situation where security is all about the block reward and we know where that's going. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:48:01
Funny, I would prefer the opposite (and could code it) but have enough respect for the community that I would not use it. That reddit thinks 20mb is some kind of magic pixie dust that will cause imminent moon is a sign that we have a lot more work to do educating people about this system works.

Certainly new buyers shouldn't buy from you since they may not observe proper escrow procedures but it should be possible to get started. Be warned however that banks are looking for cash deposit activity and getting cash deposits from many locations and large amounts and if it looks like you're doing currency exchange you may have your account closed. Still, some are able to do it for a long time so if you are cautious it can work.

Thinking you can just raise the block size limit ignores the real cost of running the network. Despite the 95% agreement here, 20mb is just not going to happen. I know this because I know how much random crap is in the blockchain today that stands as a perpetual cost to every truly full node and is of zero economic value to the rest of us. For example someone is tumbling their coins to the tune of 100+ transactions a block and paying a minimal few hundred satoshis in fees. It's not very stealthy which to me says they're just spamming and cheaply at that. Increase to 20mb and you'll have thousands not hundreds of those transactions and again zero economic benefit to the rest of us.

Then you may be disappointed to learn that there are only 5767 nodes running now according to  and this is with the blockchain only requiring 30-something gb of storage. Being somewhat familiar with small business, I can guarantee that unless they are in finance, there's no way they will run a node that requires 1tb of high-availability storage. So then you're left with medium and large sized businesses who have the privilege.
Look, I want Bitcoin to be successful and to grow beyond niche but there are trade-offs. If you spend some time looking at the block chain you'll see there's a lot of ridiculousness, people spamming 1000 addresses many times a day to advertise. Altcoins tokenizing themselves to the tune of 1000s of transactions a week and adding bloat for the minimum fee possible.
I can tell by the votes that these concerns are not popular or maybe I'm imprecise with my wording. People want free transactions forever. I want a pony. Mike Hearn says Bitcoin will lose momentum, akin to dying in tech, if blocks become saturated and the mempool explodes. He says we can have assurance contracts that remove the need for mining to be secured through block rewards and transaction fees. Maybe. I just want to make sure people are thinking it all through....especially in the face of the Hearn-Andresen Blitzkrieg.

I think either pay a higher fee or be prepared to wait or use some way to reduce the cost of your transaction (lightning network or centralized service). I don't think anyone would pay an unseasonably high fee and wait. 
The ability to connect to and audit the network is use. Who's to say that you must be able to get your transaction confirmed for free or a few cents immediately at the expense all who might want to connect reliably?
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:44:04

Difficulty sets how hard it will be to find an acceptable hash. A nonce (a meaninglessness number) is included in the hash and changed each time so those trillions of hashes can be unique. 
The difficulty is like an upper limit on the value of a hash. So if you imagine hashing is picking a number randomly between one and a quadrillion, the number has to be under 100 for example.

Now, I have to assume that tax rules won't change. Since there is no capital gains tax in a Roth IRA, you save a minimum of 15% tax on any gain you make in the account. At the current price of GBTC of $500, which is about a 100% premium, that tax savings would be a wash if GBTC and BTC when that premium is equal to the tax one would have paid by buying and selling BTC proper. If we just say the purchase price of BTC is $250, then that capital gains = premium paid if GBTC and BTC meet at $1667. 
So if you think the price might go beyond that, then this is a decent price to pay. Also within your Roth IRA you would be free to buy, sell, diversify, and rebalance without any tax considerations. The value of that may be another component of the premium.

On the other end if you have significant costs of development, I can't think of a better project for which to do a kickstarter or IPO.

Buying the other 45% would probably cause any coin's value to skyrocket so I don't think that's the threat.

True. Doing nothing actually is an option. The market for including transactions based on fees is already working and still some zero fee transactions get mined. I'm not going to weep for those who are too cheap to pay 100 bits for eternal storage. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 03:56:24
The block chain is the ledger of all transactions and the data upon which all nodes agree to achieve consensus. 
Mining setups are basically generating lottery tickets that are based on recent blocks and transactions. 
Transactions are created by the software of people who have bitcoins and are broadcast to the entire network. If they are valid and include enough fees they get included into the block chain. 
There are an astronomical number of possible bitcoin addresses so there's no need to keep track of which ones are used when creating a new one. The space of addresses is so huge in fact that generating a duplicate address should not happen in our lifetimes. 
If you have more questions, ask away!

Investing in Bitcoin is most easily and directly done by buying BTC units however you can then storing them offline. If you are investing more than $10k, you might want to divert a small amount to developers of open source projects for Bitcoin or to tipping. If you want more leverage, you can invest a similarly small amount in one or two of the altcoins since these tend to rise and fall more than Bitcoin in the case of a genuine, new money bubble. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:48:14
There are many ways to use bitcoin though, fees to pay for storage in the blockchain is probably the fundamental one. To bring out gold, I would say it's primarily useful because it is scarce and that is a quality that bitcoin shares. It just so happens to be extremely easy to reassign ownership without regard to geography. I think that it cannot be confiscated makes it even better at the store of value use than its payment network features are at doing their thing. As a payment network it's faster than wires for now but isn't quite as good (if you really get down to the security and confirmations) as traditional payment networks. So for payments we'll probably see federations of off-chain systems to improve that.

Arbitrageurs, people who keep balances at multiple exchanges, look for opportunities to for example, buy bitcoin at one exchange and sell it immediately for more at another. The thing is, it takes capital to do this, time to transfer that capital and there is obviously some risk in keeping funds at exchanges, so there will always be a disparity.
To your practical point, if you want the recipient to have a certain number of dollars, you'll need to look at the price they can get at their local exchange and buy btc accordingly. The cost or profit from such a transfer is something you should figure out whether to split or just pay as the sender.

There is no "meant to be"  for Bitcoin. It is what it is. Now it's a system that isn't to onerous to be a full participant in. At 20mb, you do let more people pay for coffees but far fewer will be able to afford to run a node. The question is whether we should make it easier to have widespread auditing of the network and transactions or if we should prioritize for transactional ubiquity. I would say you can build additional services to support the latter if you have the former. If the former breaks down though, we're all completely screwed. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 00:07:39
Security is a spectrum and I think you're looking for the best of all worlds with no trade-offs. Ignoring your caveats I think paper wallet with bip38 passwords are pretty good. Then you need to segment between daily funds and long term storage. More than that though is not keeping money with third parties unless absolutely necessary for action. If you do need easier access, a Trezor or other hardware component is going to make sense.

Some transactions, even with high fees, would not be confirmed. For example, any transactions sending funds to a publicly known wikileaks address would never appear in the blockchain. More insidious would be a case where there is a whitelist of addresses that have been confirmed to have KYC behind them. Any txns that send outside of those addresses wouldn't get confirmed.

It occurred to me that beyond the store of value, having bitcoins in order to be able to pay fees to get your transaction in this unique ledger is a sort of intrinsic value.

Yes a miner can choose to include whatever transactions they want including none at all. Of course if they include invalid transactions, other nodes in the network will not relay it on to other nodes.
A miner creates a block by first choosing the transactions then computing hash after hash of the data inside until an acceptable hash is generated to produce a valid block. 
In practice, miners add transactions during the search for an acceptable hash so hopefully even transactions made a few second ago can be included. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:11:22
The correct answer is to wait until a proper fee market develops. Transations either get into a block or they don't so we need some way for transactions to be promoted which is a feature that only gets fully developed and tested when fees matter.

The transaction fee that is required to be confirmed in the next block is about two to five cents. I'd hardly call that the currency of the rich. Running a node is arguably that though. With 20mb blocks you're going to need to lay down a hundred for a hard drive or easily more than a hundred per month to run a reliable data center based node.

Commercial mining depends on price stability and efficiency to profit. As the price drops it will be the large mining farms that cannot weather the storm who go bust, and we will see a return to the home miner. 
More accurately, mining is distributed geographically but also by type of entity. We will with lower prices and slower efficiency growth see hash rate shift from commercial to smaller less formal entities  driven by speculation and ideology. 
This is actually good news as long as the equipment that is turned off finds its way to home users.

Looking at the data from mtgoxusd, there was about $200 million in volume during the month leading up to the April 2013 peak, and $900 million in the 45 days before the last one. If you assume that the volume is real, and can accept for a rough calculation that volume at other exchanges didn't matter, then we can say an upper bound of $1 million per dollar or perhaps $800m to get back to $1k and $10B to get to $10k.
In terms of what is different about a future rise versus the ones that came before, liquidity might be higher now meaning it would take more dollars to move the needle, though a lot more people know how to get bitcoin now at ATMs, Coinbase, Circle, LB, and others so potential demand could outstrip that liquidity.

Any arbitrage opportunity will evaporate once trading starts so I don't think that's going to play much of a wealth concentration effect. GBTC does make it easier for people with more money than technical prowess to own bitcoin but any serious amount of inflow will probably do more for current holders than new buyers. Whether GBTC makes rich people richer would then depend on the amount of BTC that are held by the rich before trading starts.

Ripple has existed in two forms. One was a peer-to-peer system based on debt that found a small core following from several years ago. The second and the one mentioned here was completely different but used the same name. Ripple (the second, which I would only talk about) issued 100B units and the company behind it OpenCoin held about 20B which was distributed among the founders. 
The rest were to be issued somehow that was never fully fleshed out. I mean they ran forum threads on Bitcointalk and on the ripple forums where they gave out millions of them. Though they got many into circulation, they never got a majority into circulation and as someone who understands Bitcoin, its hard to trust that the process would remain fair going forward.
The other issue is that of their mining-less algorithm to keep the system secure. They created a consensus algorithm that worked off of signed broadcasts and selective peering. It seemed like it would work but others who are more technical than I described attacks (like by partitioning the network or creating chokepoints) for which good defenses were not offered. In addition, the server software wasn't released which (has it ever been?) despite promises that the system would be fully open sourced so the network could not be fully analysed by researchers.
Things may have changed since I followed it but the proposed weaknesses in the consensus algorithm always stuck with me. That makes this Stellar business sound no better long-term.

I wouldn't worry about it too much. Some people don't upgrade for a while and those that are running full nodes tend to have different priorities than the most people here. It seems many in have hitched their wagon to 20mb blocks as being what Bitcoin needs while core devs who have more knowledge of the trade-offs have mostly stuck to the development mailing list (just out of respect for their own time). If you have time, I would recommend reading the posts there as there are some serious reservations that don't get upvoted here.

Philosophically this decision is about where on the spectrum Bitcoin lies between recording every purchase by anyone on the planet and only allowing the rich to read/transact directly on the block chain. Hopefully we stay in a middle ground where normal folks can transact directly with some cost, some of it being in bandwidth and storage, and the other part in fees. I think the task is balancing these two costs to minimize overall cost for independent financial transaction.

The user will only see the ip address of an exit node. The exit node doesn't know which other exit node is talking to the server.

I disagree, also having been in this community for years, that it's been a serious issue. Scaling is important but it need not be done at the expense of decentralization. 
Smart programmers don't just throw more hardware (others hardware by the way) at the problem. They solve the problem. That's what Lightning looks like to me. A soluttion. It's not ready yet but we don't have a pressing issue yet. 
The stress tests taught us some things but didn't lead to a phase change. We don't have permanently full blocks and fees never really rose above the defaults in most clients.
Things that still concern me are 1) how security gets paid for when mining rewards fade away, 2) malicious miners mining huge blocks and effectively taking over the network, and 3) every miner being possible to censor due to huge bandwidth and timing constraints around profitability.
I don't know. Call me cautious. I'm prepared to wait a decade for mass adoption and I won't trade any security to speed that up by a few years.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:34:26
Don't listen to me. If you have time, try to figure out if you're missing part of the picture? I.e. Did Hearn tell you everything or did he leave things out? Why do people who are not part of Blockstream want to "change the mission?" What is the urgency? What happened in May that set this all off? Who stands to win (besides from general adoption and lower fees for longer) from Bitcoin supporting bigger blocks? How do you think incumbent economic interests will try to gain control over Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:23:23
We don't really know. The timing of the drop with the XT block being mined was pretty close so that's plausible but it also could have been a coincidental trade, fat finger, software glitch, or TPTB putting the smack down.

It is incorrect to say that XT will always put you on the longest chain. As soon as coins are spent on the &gt;1mb fork from any coinbase generated after the forking block appears, the two forks will become unmergable. If after that time, the 1mb fork becomes longer XT will fall behind.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:15:18

Nobody is in control. If the block size or anything else will change about Bitcoin it will have some level of coordination to lay out a path but the decision will be emergent, depending on lots of factors. 
As for the two worlds, I fear the big block world to be too similar to the one in which we live. Another system that can only be managed and accessed by those that have lots of resources.
The small block world leaves open the possibility for slightly bigger blocks to satisfy reasonable use cases in the face of the scalability challenge. It also places nearer to us a time when many or nearly all computing devices can be listening and participating in the network. For payment channels, lightning, smart contracts, and coffees alike.

The best way to think about this is simply supply and demand for each of the Bitcoin Network and Lightning Network. Unless people value continuous microtransactions or instant transactions, they should prefer to use BN. If fees are too high on BN they open up a connection on LN and transact through that. LN's security is based on BN's so I don't think you need to worry about LN causing any kind of collapse in BN fees or security.

Interrogation officer "of even 1.1 billion yen from the mount Gokkusu company funds have been lending to affiliated companies. Do not had illegally diverted the funds were entrusted from customers."
Karupuresu "non. This also a legitimate accounting treatment. In fact, we have consult an accountant in advance."
Interrogation officer "in, what disappeared Where is the Bitcoin"

"And about 65 million bits coins in unauthorized access from the outside (equivalent approximately 8.7 billion yen at the time of rate), there is no more money of up to 2.8 billion yen, which was entrusted by the customer"
And explained that, emphasized that he is also a victim. I was a victim consult with the Metropolitan Police Department cyber crime division.
But, investigators of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department investigation two Division who received the provision of information from the department analyzes the materials, led to the anti-believe.
"The authority that has access to the company's account data, Karupuresu only do not have. Karupuresu Although the victims face, bankruptcy is a" self-made kno "," mastermind that he is what was fertilize the Shifuku using the company It must be a person "-"

By tampering with the company's data, his account balance of the $ 1 million (about 100 million 24 million yen) because the padding is, but the contents of the suspect. Specialist group of intelligence criminal investigation, the Karupuresu the investigation two Division has decided to arrest, heck someone.
He was born in Burgundy region of eastern France in '85.
"My parents are both members of the secret society" Mensa "that can not be admission that it is not the IQ148 or more. There is also gifted education by the mother of a physical teacher, Karupuresu began remember the programming language by touching the computer with the 3-year-old, easy at the time of the 5-year-old such seems to have been writing a program "(friend of Karupuresu)
Karupuresu, such as competent system engineers as a net mail order companies and game companies, after a place to place the IT companies of France, over Israel, then, will visit Japan in June '09.
"It is a result of interest in manga and anime were Takaji. I like" Yu ☆ Yu ☆ White Paper "since I was in elementary school, also from where it had remembered the Japanese while you are watching cartoons, how intelligence is high We know how "(supra and friends)
After coming to Japan, Karupuresu the exchange of virtual currency in March '11, Yuzuriukeru the mount Gokkusu company. To enhance convenience by adding a hand to its system, in '13 years were allowed to grow to the largest bit coin exchanges. Bitcoin officials marvel at the skills, Karupuresu be to indulge the name of "genius programmer".

Sidechains aren't for scaling because they have the same issue that blocks large enough to support higher transaction rates will tend toward centralized mining. Sidechains are for experimentation(i.e. routing around deadlocks) and diversity of transactional rules.
For scaling, the best proposals so far are extension blocks, Lightning, and cautiously increasing block size. If we need to support 1000x more people, we're not going to get there with block size without eliminating lots of parties from being able to mine. It's going to take something that trustlessly and securely moves lots of those transactions offchain.

The bitcoin community has a bit of a division right now between people who want adoption at all costs and those that are concerned for the foundation of long-term security for the system. It started a few months ago with a barrage of posts by a couple of rogue developers and they've fed the fire ever since. Over the past week, instances of censorship have occurred as the latter group exerted some of its power. To be fair, it is a response to said rogue devs spending some of their political capital. I think the situation will work itself out but that is basically what has been going down.

There are projects working on these things but where the rubber meets the road is, will courts honor your deeds. As an artist you can definitely embed a hash or specify ownership in some way but the same could be done without the blockchain.

The 750kb is a soft limit or one that is just a default configuration that miners can change easily. In the past it was 250kb and was bumped up when transaction volume rose to the point that blocks routinely hit the default limit. 
This time it won't be bumped in Bitcoin Core which Jeff sees as a kind of policy change. It's the unwritten policy of no longer increasing the default soft limit that Jeff wanted to highlight. It seems he has succeeded at least for those that learn of this thread.

A reasonable post but I think it's not a good idea to refer to XT and a change in block size as the same thing. XT throws in a lot of other stuff. Keep the issue focused on the block size and under what circumstances people can agree that it should change, and by how much.
For example if we can achieve 6 BTC average total fees per block by the next halving then we could increase the block size limit by 1 MB. The next halving would require another 6.5 BTC before the block size could again be increased by another 2 MB.

I would need to do a lot of research, akin to an interview process to make the choice myself. Since that hasn't been necessary for me thus far, I trust that those who have commit access, who are actually working on and improving the Bitcoin code that's running today, to keep doing that. 
If a majority of them feel larger blocks cause more problems than they'd solve right now and that a contentious hard fork is never a good thing for Bitcoin then I'm cool with that. 
When I've delved deeper to make a more informed decision on the block size issue, I have found also that the risks outweigh the gains. That's why I'm here. Talking is just the first step. If XT seems like it's going to gain traction and I don't hear some better arguments from those I trust, I am prepared to spend a significant amount of money setting up miners, nodes, and whatever I'll need to do to keep the system decentralized. Will it be enough? I'm not sure but it's better spent than let to rot on the vine against interests who would choose to co-opt the system and turn it into a glorified PayPal.

Running a node isn't about privacy (remember Bitcoin's not anonymous but you can and should use Tor to publish transactions if you wan't privacy). 
Running a node is about trust. If you don't run your own node, you are trusting others to have verified the entire history, to tell you if you received a payment or not and whether that payment has been confirmed so many times. Maybe you'll just check multiple block explorers but then you're depending on them to report accurately and on the SSL link to you not being compromised. If you want to trust Bitcoin payments you should run a node and the easier we can make that, the better for all sorts of applications.

This is very similar to when a startup tries to estimate their potential revenues. They say things like "the total addressable market is 100,000 people x 4000 cities" and then they say "if we could just get 1% of that market, we'd have x nodes". It's not a great way to estimate things in startups and it's not the way we should estimate the number of nodes there will be on the Bitcoin p2p network. The reason is that it ignores the very many factors that go into either running a node or not. Make it expensive enough, or reduce the additional utility enough, and reality doesn't meet the projection.
It's not really about the number of nodes. It's about the fraction of them that can be operated undetectably. You can say, what are they going to break down every door and seize every Bitcoin node? No, but they could do traffic analysis to figure out where a node might be running (especially a mining one) and just break down those doors. The higher the block size limit, the greater the potential bandwidth needs, and the harder it would be to operate an independent or unsanctioned node.

Ahh, they don't use a unique identifier per se. What they do is look at deposits and withdrawals that they know were associated with the wallet in question. By tracing transactions from deposit through to withdrawal, how outputs of different transactions are combined, and figuring out the overall graph, they can start to build an image of all the money flowing through that wallet/service. The image will generally not be complete unless they know every deposit and withdrawal but if the service isn't designed against this type of analysis, or if the wallet is used without regard for the types of associations that can be made, then it can be pretty complete.

Economic incentives in Bitcoin are powerful. Unfortunately some organizations would prefer to subsume Bitcoin. Making it so only the largest of them can afford to run a node is one way they can do that. If and when it becomes clear that a fee market won't work  or that significant amounts of fee revenue are being left on the table just due to the inability to service enough transaction volume then yes I think it'll be easier to come to that consensus.

We have time. Lightning seems good enough.
Ok, let's say we go to 8mb blocks today. Obviously some nodes will drop off the network...ones with less bandwidth or less resources in general. Those that are better funded or colo'd or part of a payment processing business will stay up. So the distribution will shift toward monied interests. Keep moving that slider toward bigger and bigger blocks and I can't imagine anything other than a future where there are like 100 nodes, all run by fortune 500 companies, who receive and comply with government orders as a cost of doing business. At this point, only transactions using registered addresses with full KYC will be allowed to be mined.
Call this situation absurd but if I didn't think it could happen I'd be for bigger blocks too. 
There are other coins of course and they won't be able to censor them all but Bitcoin is the big one. It's the one that has a chance to get and stay beyond government and corporate control. That is unique and that's what is worth fighting for.
Ask yourself why people are so hell bent on these bigger blocks? Is it really just because they want to keep transactions cheap so more people can use Bitcoin?

That's debatable. Fees in the client have been tweaked down and the soft limit has been bumped but I do not recall any specific policy on blockchain growth ever being decided. The closest thing to a policy that I can recall is the Scalability wiki page that used hand-wavy language about technology probably staying ahead of Bitcoin adoption.
What has been clear from the beginning is that Bitcoin will need tp be secured by fees eventually and the only way that happens is with some kind of scarcity in transaction rate. That scarcity just happens to align with the need to keep mining decentralized.

You want Bitcoin to be PayPal, all neat, centralized, and easy to control. You work for the status quo. Bitcoin and decentralization are thorns in your (or your employer's) side and you will do anything you can to put it down. See what I did there? I don't need substance. Accusation is enough.

Not necessarily. They may find it more effective to smear it and its users rather than do an outright ban. In the US, a lot is done via the threat of fines and coupled with vague language and nebulous criteria. The current situation with Coinbase is largely due to the Bank Secrecy Act and the threat of $1m fines for a bank that doesn't have its compliance shit together.
The "opening for other governments" argument gets shut down by global trade deals that hand over ever more power to corporate interests (TPP). What's interesting is that corps are starting to complain about a strong dollar which may lead to more QE and spark the next Bitcoin rise.
At some point, the most powerful entities in the world will have to decide whether they like Bitcoin or not. Since we as a race tend to be neutering representative governments and empowering corporations, we'll mostly have to make the case that Bitcoin is better for them than for the soon-to-be-obsolete central bankers of the world. Once Bitcoin provides more benefit to industry as a whole than whatever is derived from getting free funny money, the shift will be inevitable.

Developers don't control Bitcoin but they are the messengers who bring information about how it works and how changes might affect the system. They have this messenger power (or responsibility) because they must understand the system in order to make changes to it. 
Decentralization is not the default. It's a carefully managed attribute of the system and any number of changes can remove it, some irreversibly.

I don't agree that a bigger block is the way to scale to that level of public buy-in. It's really going to take something like lightning to get there, plus some centralized services taking up the slack. More than that, however, is a mass realization that fiat currency is fraud. 
If we go to big block too early, we preclude the core belief group in that mass realization from operating on the Bitcoin p2p network trustlessly and securely.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:56:01
We can. That doesn't mean that the block size limit must be raised now.
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:11:47
Fairly likely but increasingly expensive over time. If they want to push the price down, they'll need to borrow btc to sell the rates for which should grow if they try too hard. When margin interest rates get high enough, others may see an opportunity to buy and cause margin calls...i.e. losses for them. This would repeat and show its face as high volume volatilty which should attract capital to provide extra liquidity. Basically it should get more and more expensive to manipulate over time.

You're assuming that miners on the larger chain will necessarily attack the smaller chain even though it can easily cost them money. The time of a split will be a stressful time for miners and they are likely to become very conservative about how they use their hashes.


Really? They'll probably be cheaper and if you believe in that fork you may see that as profit potential. Some traders who come in after the split might buy some of each. It's a very uncertain situation.

The ultimate aim was never scaling over all. The aim is to have a free-as-in-freedom monetary system and improve it so that it scales while remaining free and decentralized. Unfortunately a block size limit that is too big threatens that freedom without which all the scale in the world won't matter just as PayPal (who scales easily) doesn't really matter for the freedom goal.

An additional wrinkle is that people often have more than one email address and having more than one Coinbase account is I think against their TOS. At least I can recall someone being hassled for using more than one account even though they may have been helping a relative with that account.

@_date: 2015-07-02 18:20:50
In the recent stress test, hash power switched to pools that skipped the spam and continued to mine other transactions. That could have been the action of a large number of smaller miners or one bigger one. With no hash power at the smaller end, everyone has to just hope bigger miners feel as they do. My point is, this kind of signaling is additional to the profit motive as a reason why someone would mine.

Too much opportunity for fraud. This has been asked about lots of times because it would be great if it could work. Unfortunately it requires trusting the merchant and their customers so maybe with 6 months of escrow. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 08:23:47
You don't really help the discussion by down voting. If you respond, you are sort of saying I'm adding to the discussion which is what voting is for. Else you get an echo chamber. Is that your goal? 
The reason is because only miners can implement a blacklist. Coerce enough hash power and you can orphan blocks by smaller miners that don't obey. We have to keep hash power anonymous enough that they can't be found and coerced. Bigger blocks work against that. Simple.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:39:02
Business licenses are technically required for all businesses that have a physical location in a city. Enforcement is quite hard though. If you attempt to write off home office space or lease a shop space then data miners may find and bill you. Otherwise, and until you need a shop/workshop or the business is viable you can probably ignore these licenses.

It's good to be thinking about strategies and insurance may have a place.

Even a small discount is likely to induce payment in BTC. It's all about how much hassle is involved in going from what a tenant has to bitcoin. Anything that reduces that hassle, like getting paid in bitcoin, having easy or automatic bitcoin purchase, or even automatic rent payment, will make it a more likely option.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:25:01
Yeah, I think the fees are going to have to go up. Block size should be kept small and low cost transactions should go off-chain to preserve security for the killer app that store-of-value is.

Talking about a Fidelity problem for today's Bitcoin is like talking about a YouTube problem for the 1995 internet. Ignoring the limitations of today's technology while attempting to force the system to handle a particular use case could very well distort the network into something I don't want it to become.
The recent scalability summit was a good step. In 2011, we thought Bitcoin could take over the world and we were right but I think we've also realized that it's going to take much longer that we thought. If Fidelity wants to get involved, they should contribute to scalability solutions rather than whine that their massive company can't turn on a fucking beta.

To add to this, realize that a proof-of-work algorithm needs to be quick to verify and must be able to run without checking with a central organization, like for example one that would hand out work that would be useful for science. In addition a proof-of-work algorithm that is valued for another purpose can compromise the security of the network by giving attackers an incentive to mine for something other than the block reward and transaction fees.

It's true but it's less secure, not more. 
An address is a hash of a public key. In order to steal bitcoins that were sent to an address that hasn't had its public key exposed, you must obtain the private key to a public key that hashes to that address. If coins *were* spent from the address, the job is easier (but not easy) as you only need to obtain the private key to a known public key.

It's not really possible to create this since $GBTC is different than even the 0.1 btc that it entitles the shareholder to.

The goal is not to pass on volatility but to pass on freedom and distribute the regulatory compliance load. If employees only get $50 or $100 per week of btc, they shouldn't have any problem converting that via a coinbase or circle. Try it out with a limited pilot project where employees can sign up just as well as customers. When you see that you can handle more volume, increase slots in the program. Don't count on digital USD playing nice with BTC until it's absolutely forced to.

Karpeles provided information on his customers in an attempt to stay right with jesus (the USG) but in the end was used as a bargaining chip in a couple of petty theives' scheme.
Mark Karepeles, operator of MtGox, realized that Bitcoin and his thriving exchange would be better served if they stayed on the right side of the law. This being an altoever international world, they sent along reports to the US Gov whenever something suspicous crossed their exchange. MtGox may have turned over information on high-level vendors but as he was not interested in fiat, Ulbricht likely never made that list.
On the other side, a couple of LEO hacks decided they could take this "anonymous" money and set themselves up. They got in deep. Bitcoin is enthralling after all. But they didn't realize just how complete the picture around them would become. They got caught. 
Kerbopples tried his best to keep it real but lives with the spoils of running the first exchange to hit it big to this day. These DEA folks are now getting theirs and in the process enlightening us all to just what it's like on the other side.

Before you move coins into your wallet(s), you should think about each wallet as a different place you're storing money. The wallet you carry with you don't have as much as you bank account and neither should a wallet like blockchain.info or itBit have more than your Bitcoin Core or Armory wallet. If you're just going to setup one wallet and aren't dealing with much BTC you could use Mycelium on Android. It's pretty secure and the use of a seed in that app means you can just make one backup and be set for as long as you use that wallet. Hope that helps. Feel free to continue with any questions.

More eyeballs on the blockchain whatever their purpose should increase the value in publishing there. Blockchain space is limited so fees will rise to meet that value.

Venmo volume could be on par given strong growth but it's a bit apples to oranges since Venmo is more targeted and limited while we have things in Bitcoin like Bitstamp moving tens of millions or whatever between wallets.

She's a receptionist so people probably take her feedback with a grain of salt but if you were her manager, you would definitely want to know when she goes overboard. Whether disciplinary action is warranted is really up to the organization.

Giving people miners is actually a good way to create mass adoption but the fees should be like a pool 1-5%, not like iTunes 30%. Also, the code needs to be free software, otherwise it's harder to verify that all your electricity is going toward your own hashpower. Software could be set to only mine off-peak or when it's cold.
It is good for folks to have a chance to own a small amount of bitcoin for what is generally a tack-on to their electricity bill and especially with the difficulties most people would have turning dollars into btc. If everyone's a miner you can offer cash to your friends for their btc and more low-level informal commerce would be seeded.
@_date: 2015-09-30 07:35:54
Probably quite a bit but the majority of economic activity would need to be over a payment network like lightning to support something with the high transactional volume of global file sharing. This will be good because lots of btc will be called into action to fund links in the payment network and there will start to be a reason to pay a level of fees that can begin to replace the block reward and ensure growth in the security of the network.

That would be an investment company. Most companies only hold currencies or contracts on currencies to hedge exposure due to their revenues or costs being in other currencies.

If they don't aim to replace Bitcoin, then why say that it's unnecessary? Wouldn't a bigger Bitcoin create more of a need for their service? The legacy system does need something better than what they have but Bitcoin is providing the competitive pressure for them to want to change. Take away the unnecessary Bitcoin and the banks will go back to ignoring everyone because it's cheaper than making something optimal. 
The massive premine is impressive in its ambition but a few folks creating hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap in something they keep saying "shouldn't have value" is a major red flag. If it's not supposed to have value, why don't they use some of their massive currency reserves to appropriately crush the price of XRP?

It's hard to argue that getting code reviewed by almost any programmer isn't worth some expense. What I appreciate though is his provocative way of thinking about Bitcoin and how it might be attacked. We definitely need people who are considering new kinds of problems so we don't get surprised. 
If you're a core dev, you know of so many issues that hearing about another one is annoying. If you only use Bitcoin and aren't interested in developing it, learning anything about the challenges at the core level might help motivate your support of there being more code reviews and core devs to actually code.

I mean, Bitcoin mining chips will be optimized to the point where they won't be made obsolete without massive breakthroughs in chip manufacturing. Until now miners struggled more with basic design, marketing, manufacturing and honesty. Once chips are state-of-the-art and produced by relaible organizations, they'll be borderline profitable for longer, bringing a level of stability that would be required of a consumer miner.
Intel, ARM and others choose the most cost-effective manufacturing process they can. They weigh chip manufacturing yields, power consumption, and one-time NRE costs, and units sold to predict what will be profitable. Thing is, they have been working with the cutting edge and large budgets for much longer than Bitcoin has been a significant market. 
Before ASICs, no large NRE costs could be absorbed. Now, economies of scale are being achieved and at $100m+ almost anything can be funded. We'll soon be right up against Moore's law. 
It is true that Bitcoin mining incentivizes innovation but the hardest physical limits of just what can be done in materials processing will prove to be the great stabilizer.
Bitcoin being distributed to 100s of millions of people via simple mining appliances is kind of an awesome thought. Once the chips settle down, it'll make sense and we'll see it.

There are a couple of things to think about. One is that holding Bitcoin hasn't been risk free from a value standpoint and early investors may or may not be rewarded for supporting this system. If things go well, people with large amounts of BTC may decide they are overexposed and diversify out into other assets. 
The other is that any economic depression that cannot be dealt with via monetary adjustments will likely work itself out when people need to buy things. We won't have to guess if demand is real or decipher so much economic haze when deflationary currency is being traded for goods and services. There will still be credit in a Bitcoin future but it will need to be managed more carefully. We should then be able to trust our money more fully and more easily get to the root of economic problems. 
In the long run, what Bitcoin will give us is a place to put value where it cannot be usurped by whoever is at the top politically. This should means we as a species make better decisions as they will be out of agreed-upon need instead of the threat of violence.

It doesn't sound good, perhaps it's better to wait until someone with a reputation starts trading there. If you must, then propose to meet in a bank. Not saying nothing bad can happen there but the cameras are a pretty effective deterrent.

If you need cheap you could buy used. Any printer that can print from a usb stick should work. Usually these have a usb port on the front as well as a screen so you can navigate to files/photos that would be on the usb stick. New ones seem to be in the $50-100 range. Couldn't find one for less than $50 new.
One thing I'm really curious about with these printers is how likely they are individually and as a class to store printed images in memory somewhere. The concern is that if someone did use one of these printers online, could a hacker retrieve an image of a recently printed paper wallet.
One approach could be to buy such a printer and use it only for this never allowing it to get online or be connected to a computer. (Tinfoil hat note: If you fear the unit is remembering something, you could disassemble it after making your wallets and destroy any chips on the motherboard.)

Generally in investing you try to keep fees to 1% though for higher risk assets, you might tolerate larger fees.

As the cost of electricity falls, more of it will be used until the average cost per block is around the block reward (25btc now) * the bitcoin price ($275 now). Cost of electricty per kwh falling would mean that more kwh would be spent per block. Of course there are capital costs to consider as well.

They could confirm the trade by sms or through an app so no need for them to be near the machine at the same time.

Parkt appears to be offering cash rebates in bitcoin for parking at partner garages and lots of other businesses which makes a lot of sense since you check-in after you park and get offers.
The downside would be privacy concerns since ostensibly this app needs your location, maybe tax info, and would have a window into your wallet.
But if you're aware of those concerns and want to basically not lose money doing something essential, it might make sense. It'll be interesting to see how this evolves.

Public keys are exposed, yes but adding a second public key makes an already astronomical problem, twice or more as hard.
The concern as you may know with address reuse is that once the public key is exposed, the attacker just has to break ECDSA instead of ECDSA and RIPEMD-160. 
I guess I see your point in that if you can break one ECDSA keypair, maybe you can break two, or three, or whatever. We'll just have to deal. We also have this problem with message signing.

I'd like to see keychain replace wallet and sign replace send. As you write, address is useful for conveying it's something people give out to receive funds. Of course there are many other to consider but what's probably novel about this paper to most bitcoiners is the methodology of walking through the use case and asking those three questions at each point.
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:14:40

I'm speaking more about the backend. 2fa is good but is easy to get wrong on both for the site and user. 
When an attacker attempts to steal coins they are counting on a lack of human oversight that just doesn't exist outside of Bitcoin. There is the possibility that human review of outgoing transactions introduces other risks but at the beginning the reviewer is probably someone with access to the wallet anyway so that initial risk is minimal.
The other thing is about discouraging lots of btc to be stored at one place. Smaller wallets reduce the incentive to attack a site. Unfortunately most services keep too much in their hot wallets and depending on how smooth  they want their operation to run (before getting hacked) they could keep a significant fraction of their reserves hot. The best cold storage might be one where large account holders hold funds using m-of-n or time locking with the exchange. They are creditors so it probably makes sense to distribute ownership better. It would be good to see more of what okcoin did whether they release their real procedure or not, it helps drive discussion of very unfinished business.

Directly linking transaction history with fraudulent behavior is a new idea. What this may now make clear is that every output will be assigned to an entity and a permanent reputation will be built for each entity. We're not talking about blacklisting or whitelisting but instead some very granular and very persistent grey listing. 
This is a shot across the bow for transactional privacy. One could imagine that eventually, outputs from new or unknown entities will require jumping through  additional hoops. Like mass surveillance in general, the defence requires that the tools like TOR, stealth addresses, coinjoin, and careful handling of outputs become ubiquitous in their use.

1) You can convert some or all of your bitcoin immediately after receipt if you wish to avoid the volatility. It works both ways though, if the price goes up did you get paid more per hour? I prefer to think of it like you got paid what you got paid, then you speculated for better or worse on the BTC/USD price.
2) In the US at least, it seems you're ok as long as there isn't large amounts of cash going in and out. What they're looking for is people running some kind of currency exchange through their accounts. If you get Coinbase incoming and outgoing with no major cash activity, I doubt you'd face many repercussions. Of course, things can change but as long as you don't mix high volumes of cash and bitcoin, you're probably ok now. Also, pay your taxes. 
If you give more info on which country you're in, you can get better advice.

I think you're mainly asking about routine updates and are getting a lot of replies about incompatible updates. To be sure most updates are routine and users have no problem transacting in those situations. Bitcoin is actually unique in that the network depends on certain rules being widely agreed upon. Most updates don't change those rules but when they do, that's when you get into forks and more of the long term planning side of Bitcoin. 
As for where discussion occurs on what will make into the Bitcoin Core software, that happens here, on the developer mailing list, bitcointalk.org forums, then as it gets closer to being put in, at the github, finally being released and then it sees uptake based on how many people trust it.

I was speaking to when Bitcoin had access to the state-of-the-art trading technology. Basic mining started with CPU which was state-of-the-art technology at the time. Then it went to using tech like GPUs in unintended ways, then it began to build its own (FPGA and more ASIC) so I'm looking forward to what Bitcoin drives to be created beyond this very substantial step.

The difference here versus the legacy banking system is that Bitcoin is at the foundation and is accessible by anyone. If Coinbase or another actor should get too big or too important, users are free to seek alternatives or to create their own.
It may be the case that Coinbase is too big at this stage but like the Cex.io issue in controlling too large a mining stake, the community has the right incentives I believe to manage the risk.

This is kind of silly. I mean, without Bitcoin Coinbase would be just another PayPal clone.

Zero-conf transactions aren't really supposed to be trusted since there is some probability that they will never get confirmed. I suppose this makes some core developers uncomfortable since it is often used in the retail scenario as if the payments are fully trusted. The thing is, *it is useful* and replace-by-fee takes away that utility. Bitpay and Coinbase both indicate that a payment was received on zero-conf, behavior that would have to be modified in a world with replace-by-fee.
The trade off I guess is to stop people from using Bitcoin in an insecure manner for accepting payments and at the same time, letting users unstick payments that haven't yet been confirmed.
I think it's better to educate people about the risks of zero-conf so they know that they do carry some risk. At this early stage of adoption these semi-instant payments do help people dip their toes in the pool in social settings, i.e. paying for a beer or coffee.

There might be a currency conversion in the process but of course it would be groundbreaking. Those banks just need to open up these custodial accounts with each other and they can do their same operations off-chain, only going on-chain when the sender or recipient weren't a SWIFT member bank.

My questions are motivated by a free access system like Bitcoin. We use miners to build trust in transactions over a period of hours. In this case it sounds like trust is implicit in being a member of SWIFT-processing banks or members or whatever you'd call them. By removing the counterparty risk, Bitcoin lets anyone transact without prior approval. If SWIFT could handle different currencies then Bitcoin could be just another one but with a reach far beyond what the accreditation process could accomplish. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:27:37
The problem is most people won't mine at a loss. Some will mine with free electricity but the big farms that are responsible for much of the hash rate would curtail their mining a lot. That being said, the function of the network would be fine. It's just that a hash rate based attack becomes much cheaper and we're still not at the point that an interested government couldn't carry out such an attack.
