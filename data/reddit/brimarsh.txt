I've been slowly building my bitcoin collection. I have one coin from $250, another coin from $660. A few more partial coins from along the way.   I've been having more fun than is reasonable just playing along and checking the price daily.   However, I promised myself that if the price ever falls to my break-even point that I'd sell (I don't really have money to lose).
My breakeven point is at about BTC = $520.  I'm afraid that this drop is going to take away my toy of 1.5yrs and I won't be able to play along anymore. I'm scared.  Somebody hold me.

You can set a price alert, but who knows how much further it will fall before you get your coins back on the exchange to sell.

What's the beef with coinbase? Asking as a noob, not as a defense to coinbase.

I read your comment and it made me almost forget I was on Reddit.  Remarkable!

Amazon Web Services.
Basically a ton of companies use Amazon's services for their web products.

I don't have a defense as to the why, other than "art".

Servers were shot during the first little bit of the sale.  Same thing happened with my CC purchase.

I bought Firewatch when everyone in Dota kept telling me my items were wrong, everyone in League blamed everyone but themselves, and I was playing HotS wrong when I got the wrong talent or ability. GG EZ....
Anyway, Firewatch is a nice reprieve and you'll enjoy it.

Can't you create a BTC wallet without a third party? Sure you could be tracked through the exchange but after moving it from the exchange who's to say you didn't "lose" it?
I'm asking as a noob, not a troll.

This gif always makes me feel better when Bitcoin is crashing.
Though, this is less of a crash and more of a correction. We're still up $75 from the start of the week.

Officially $1400 at this exact moment. We did it!

How can I find State availability for Kraken?  How do the purchase fees compare to Coinbase?  Do I need to verify my identity (upload my ID)?

So all of this makes OP a dickhead?

Any way to transfer $1000 off of Coinbase without paying their $10 (1%) fee?  Does the desktop site maybe offer more options on sending money?
Edit: I'm a Bitcoin noob; I assumed purchase fees were the same as transfer fees.

I'll oversimplify.  Instead of a bank you give your cash to a friend to hang on to. If your friend is robbed or decides to run off with your money you have nothing.
Coinbase is not a bank. You're simply trusting them to hold your coins for you.  If they are hacked or become dishonest you have nothing.

Imagine you have a really difficult puzzle that only has one solution. It is so difficult that you can only solve it if you follow the solution instructions.  If you save the solution on your phone (or computer) someone could steal it from you by hacking your phone.  However, if you save the solution on a physical piece of paper, they can only solve the puzzle by gaining access to the physical piece of paper.  Keep the paper safe and only you can solve the puzzle.
The solution is your wallet and solving the puzzle gives you access to your bitcoins.

[Coindesk]( has a decent tutorial. Essentially, you create a random wallet, print the wallet, use the send feature on Coinbase to send the bitcoins to the new wallet, and then find a safe place for the printed wallet.

Initial investment based on his comment was ~$75,000 CAD.  The old adage, "it takes money to make money" seems to apply.  I don't know many people who could make that investment if they wanted to.

I tried to buy and got a message that my bank has a $100 / day limit?   That's new...  Sounds like I either need a new bank or a new wallet (using Coinbase)?

I've purchased in larger quantities (1BTC) just a month ago.

I don't think that's how decimal places work :D

I use '[Bitcoin Wallet - Coinbase](
What are your thoughts on that app (Android).  What makes one wallet safer than the next?

And I am not an expert :(
