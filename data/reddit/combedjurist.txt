I hope your objective isn't to actually debate, because you're so annoying I don't even read your posts. Utility: 0. Reminds me of a shitcoin!

My raspberry pi is really sweating out these few thousand transactions. Not!

The whitepaper defines Bitcoin. You should figure out what Bitcoin is before it's too late for you.

Evil! Hush them!

Uncensorable money by way of censored discussion.

Average is a bad statistic - inflated by a single mispriced tx fee. Use median for a better statistic.
[0.01 0.01 0.01 1000] average 250, median 0.01

Your insecurity speaks for itself.

Looks like Bitcoin fees are 50% cheaper than Litecoin. Show me your data.

Which is more optimized, Lightning or bigger blocks?
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:37:08
Do you realize?
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:04:31
How dare they speak what they believe.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:31:54
It's pseudonymous.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:56:31
Go shill your shitcoin on r/btc
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:53:39
This is manipulation.

Yeah, it is. Read the whitepaper. Lightning isn't sender-to-receiver / peer-to-peer. Offchain data (SegWit) isn't the full transaction style in the whitepaper.

Why not just use Bitcoin Cash? That group loves blocksize.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:49:20
If you support uncensorable money, you should be suspicious of any community of censors.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:47:10
Censorship resistant? How many have been banned for discussing larger blocks for scaling?
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:24:51
Sir! Please! I am rebuking a statement you made in public, Sir!
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:54:49
You might be confusing Bitcoin for a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:02:51
Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:48:43
Gotta spend money to make money!
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:29:30
SegWit is complex, difficult to implement securely. Easier to just increase the blocksize.

@_date: 2018-01-09 23:27:07
Why would you voluntarily pay 8c? The blocks aren't full, you can pay 1 sat / byte.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:11:38
There's no need to raise your voice. I'm right here.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:29:45
Prove it. Transaction hashes, please.

If you don't want to someone to talk to you, you should probably start by not talking to them and see how it works.
