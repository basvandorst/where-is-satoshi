Is it 2040 yet?

Now I get why the massive bump. Dude is a legit whale
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:41:02
This is it. The overall crypto market cap took a hit. But it's happened before, and it's gonna be very easy to overcome. We've seen larger dips over the past few months.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:50:58
There's like a 3% difference versus bank deposit, yeah. For amounts under 1k, it shouldn't be a big deal especially given the added liquidity
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:08
Part of the reason why BTC is slower and expensive to manage is because it is popular in the first place. Other cryptos would face similar issues if they had a comparable transaction rate and block chain size. New technologies can help, but only to a certain extent
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:15
I'm talking long term. After almost a decade, when you smooth out the bumps, growth seems consistent, especially since supply is projected to go down. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:16:55
Oh, I totally misread and thought you were refe to the total amount of coins, please ignore
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:17:26
  
  
BBC explained it pretty well. Go tell them the concept of insider trading doesn't make sense, if you insist. Clearly this cheap tabloid has no idea what they're talking about, amirite
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:55:42
Since the USD purchase/sale value of BTC was heavily impacted, there's still a solid case to be made.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:33:12
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:19:06
Agreed, especially due to the time it takes for a transaction to go through. It's like gold or diamond, except that it doesn't degrade over time like physical things. All it needs is an association with luxury in the public mindset and when that happens, it will take over the mainstream.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:37:22
Yeah, for now it's doing a great job as a traded commodity given how it doesn't degrade over time like a physical asset, but it has a long way to go before it's used as a currency
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:51:38
Also, make sure to withdraw your coins from those websites before the shit hits the fan and they attempt to run with your money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:31:33
If they included the search term "1 BTC in USD" it would jump to  easily
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:25
Depends on what you mean by use. Right now it's damn good at storing  large sums of value and retaining integrity with zero maintenance, outperforming many securities and commodities out there.  Millions of people are using bitcoin in that regard.  
As a day-to-day currency? Not so much, I agree, at least for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:59:01
Not all of them do, and even that is not a perfect solution either ~~since it will lead to inflation over time~~. And I didn't say all coins work equally, just that this has some influence in all altcoins to some extent.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:48:19
BTC has taken bigger hits (remember Mt. Gox?) and survived. Investors understand the difference between block chain security (still intact after nearly a decade) and the security of private exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:34:47
Nice try day traders
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:42:45
That's still uncertain. I'm not buying it entirely. How do you add a controversial coin with a gigantic market cap without giving it at least a 1 week's notice to investors?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:25:55
There's been a sudden growth of animosity here while BTC was soaring. It always seemed suspicious to me. Now anyone asking "are we being attacked?" is bombarded with angry replies. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:47:59
Holy shit, whoever managed to get that username must be a veteran for sure
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:03
The usage and value of BTC is up to the market to decide. Right now it makes no sense to buy pizza with bitcoin, but people also don't think about paying for pizza in precious metal like platinum.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:46:54
The total crypto market cap is set to overtake AAPL soon. It's already peaked at 650b a few days ago. BTC single-handedly overtaking AAPL is far away, but not unrealistic at all.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:34:37
If the fact that this is obviously unethical doesn't cut it for you, I'll give you one recent example of insider trading of foreign exchange being handled as illegal by a federal securities authority:    
  
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:36:30
Not if you use a credit card. It's pretty much instantaneous for me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:16
BCH's all time high in BTC was actually over a month ago to be precise, at least for now, and the baseline hasn't improved significantly over time. I'm not pissed about people making money they don't deserve, I just think that this drama is gonna be a bit damaging to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem if it endures. Two branches of a single coin should not coexist for long, the only reason why the smaller branch is still alive is because of beginners being duped and whales manipulating the market.

One of the posts was deleted already.  
Whoever leaked that info to that redditor probably broke an NDA and should at least be fired, possibly sued for damages.  
However, the fact that the BCH addition happened as a surprise is really suspicious; sounds like senior management really wanted to keep this secret. I would start by investigating whoever decided to make this coin addition without a prior official announcement.  
Imagine if CBOE added bitcoin futures all of a sudden, without warning; the SEC would be knocking on their door the next day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:32
I would definitely put a significant portion of those million dollars into BTC, not sure how much, though. Bitcoin has a long way to go, and cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy. 
Out of all cryptos, BTC is the one that has been enduring attacks for the longest amount of time, and all its current technical issues are fixable. If we're seeing this growth before all those upgrades are implemented, imagine when segwit and lightning go mainstream, and all the other possible tech that will come in the future.  
  
Can it tank in the long term? Yes, but so can the dollar, for example, if the world suddenly enters a massive global economic crisis like we haven't seen before.  
  
BTC could tank, for example, if the entire internet goes down; if people suddenly lose belief in the value of cryptocurrencies as a whole; if governments decide to crack down on it; if its security gets compromised; if another crypto surpasses it; etc. Right now I find all those scenarios less likely than the dollar crisis scenario I mentioned given how fucked up world politics is today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:55:14
Call it anything you want, "trading with privileged information", etc., that's just a matter of semantics. It still can be illegal in some countries like I just showed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:32:50
Yup. The moment you put a face on your coin, it becomes centralized on that face in the public's mind. BCH is as centralized as it gets right now. Might as well call it Rogercoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:15:33


Maybe this BBC article can enlighten you? Feel free to tell them they're also conspiracy theorists   
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:46:31
There's no major concern here. This was a pump and dump operation orchestrated by people within Coinbase. Look at the peak in BCH price and you'll see where the money went. The total crypto market is at an all time high way after the launch of BCH.  
I'm not saying BCH is a good thing, of course a competing fork is negative for PR. But it's not the reason for this current dip in particular, and I do believe that the market itself will end up naturally selling that altcoin to oblivion in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:12
The timing is key; if it happened before a public announcement, it's insider trading, no question about it.If it happened minutes after, then they'll be able to claim it was a natural response from the market. Has anyone double checked this?  
Edit: yes I know the term insider trading doesn't really apply to currencies, but you get what I mean
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:23:19
Whoa, seems like this hit a nerve for you.  
Feel free to defend disgusting insider traders if you want, but in the end of the day, it doesn't matter if it's legal or not (no one even mentioned that). Coinbase itself has vowed to investigate and terminate the employees responsible for this, that's how bad it looks.  
So if one of your friends is responsible for this, spamming "noob" on a sub you happen to hate isn't gonna help them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:06:07
Yeah, the fees are high, but their value evolves as a function of demand. If more people decide to leave bitcoin because fees are high, or the number of miners increases due to how profitable it is, the fees will drop proportionally, until it becomes attractive enough for investors again. It's a self correcting system that will always attempt to find a sweet spot.  
If BTC value continues to rise, this system will eventually turn bitcoin into a commodity like gold (which also involves crazy high fees) rather than an everyday currency, but ultimately the market will have the final word on this. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:40:45
A few days ago, nobody had any idea BCH was going to be supported. Then all of a sudden, boom, BCH goes live and whales start pumping it massively almost immediately, apparently even beforehand. You know how this could've been avoided? By giving it a few days' notice, like every reasonable exchange would.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:41
Jesus, can you guys have a discussion without acting like a third grader? Coinbase is FDIC insured and is subject to insider trading rules. Even if it wasn't, a company can't get away with using "You got played, fool" as an excuse without throwing their credibility in the trash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:02:31
By buying all that BTC, yeah
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:24:30
And why would that preclude shorting it? Nothing is fully protected from crashing
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:53:00
I'm not defending them, just pointing out the fact that this was damaging to them, since some people here seem to think 'insider trading' (or whatever you wanna call this type of act for currency trading) is no big deal
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:42:00
I'll thank you right now :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:48:43
The irony is that Dogecoin users are so kind and loving that they wouldn't plan a revenge "downvoting attack" in this subreddit at all.  
Instead they'll tip you until you can't help but join them.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:19:54
Don't you see that this is good for Bitcoin? Dogecoin is showing to the world that crypto currencies don't have to be about buying drugs and other illegal stuff.  
People are starting to see that these currencies can be completely harmless.

In-game money is still money. You still have to enter your credit card info and spend your dollars on those purchases. The perception of its value is there, and the simplified interface of a game can work as a good 'tutorial' so to speak.

Even if it were the longest, you'd expect that from the increased scale of the fluctuations in the y axis, an increase in the x direction would occur as well.

This. There is no guarantee that AAPL shares will do well, yet they continue to be the reference for reliability in the stock market

I really don't think that Bitcoin is so fragile that a relatively tiny news site is able to spike it by two digits % with some lame April fool's joke.

I'm just hoping it won't get to that point where it's so overvalued that your grandpa will be bringing it up yet again. Big red flag.  
I'm happier when I see it making slower gains, under the radar
