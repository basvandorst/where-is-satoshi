Is it possible to buy bitcoin in Japan?

And looks like ツ、 a different character.

Hehe. Looks like a death toll in a Japanese elementary school textbook.

You left out the most important bit. What does it charge per exchange?
@_date: 2019-12-08 08:52:40
Not requiring an hour for a transaction to complete.
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:52:27
What do you charge for transactions?
@_date: 2019-12-27 06:32:31
What is it's exchange rate?

I could believe it if you didn't have to wait 10 minutes to a day (average 1 hour) for the transaction to complete. Is there any reason to believe that it will go below one minute any time soon?

Still trying to figure out how to do that. So far, in Japan, the only options I see are huge percentages or nothing.
@_date: 2019-04-21 11:37:01
Thanks. I'll check it out.

I've wanted it for years, downloaded wallets, asked questions online, and spent hours a couple times a year trying to figure it out, but never have been able to find a way to buy any at a rate less than stupidly high. 
I suspect the reason for much of the refusal is that there are no unambiguous tutorials on how to do it. Each and every tutorial I've seen leads to either a dead end, 14%, or travel to another country.

Thanks. I'll check it out.

Thanks. I am not a business, so it sounds like I don't need a 3rd party. How do I find the "permanent address" you mentioned? I think I found temporary addresses that are created within the app, but nothing permanent.

I'm on the original Bitcoin wallet. When I select Request BTC, it asks for an amount and provides a QR code and tells me to have them scan it. 
I checked the address book and after messing with the accept feature, it shows I have an (unlabeled) address under my addresses. Is that what I'm looking for? It appears to be created for each transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:02:38
In my wallet I see a QR code, but no address. Where do I find an address that I could give someone online?
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:25:11
Thank you. 
The introduction tutorials I have gone over did not get into this. It is the first time I have heard of a passphrase or seed. It sounds like this is key information everyone should know before using Bitcoin. I will make sure that I fully understand all this before I go any further. Again, thanks.

The "Bitcoin Wallet" from Bitcoin.org.

Have your guys contact my guys.

Wish it was that easy in Japan.
