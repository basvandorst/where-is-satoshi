Why is this here?
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:02:22
Rage harder cuck. I got out and regret it some but i'm not gonna give myself an aneurysm over it.

I WANT a correction to a lower price, for now, to buy in more, because I do believe in it.  It is infinitely divisible and that was built in because it was a possibility it would boom hugely, at some point were going to start talking in Satoshis and thats awesome and exciting, I just want the fuckery with fees to calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:16:04
If I recall, we used to have one...?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:08:58
Elon Musk
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:11:05
its practical at a mil a coin if transaction fees stabilize, its not the coin price... not really.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:12:57
go back to fiatfag
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:57:36
I think the Bitcoin=$X is getting intimidating, but its divisibility accounts for that.  We're not to Satoshis yet but we need to start talking in tenths or hundredths.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:08:16
You're right, correction is the wrong word, dip is what I meant and I'll buy regardless, dips just make it easier.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:58:26
And common sense, and history.  People killed themselves over MtGox, unique situation but important general lesson, yet we still have people taking out second fucking mortgages to buy bitcoin.
I saw someone earlier get told that if they really did that they needed to save some money for razor blades... just sayin'
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:39
It's volatile NOW, not forever Steam pulled away from it but Craigslist is now embracing it.  You may not like it but it's slowly becoming more mainstream, and despite its high and fluctuating price, accessible.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:28:25
Exactly, it's not for everyone but I'd consider it 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:08:50
Google mtgox, If you don't actually hold your coins they aren't really yours, only keep what you're actively trading or ok losing on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:16:20
Yes, because of its limited nature, widespread adoption must drive price up and leads to use in a fractional state, this is all accounted for!!! :D
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:39:55
Probably 90 percent of people investing in bitcoin don't have any g.d. idea where its going long term... 20k didn't stick, who's to say it won't hit $20 or a quarter mil next week, month, year.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:38:16
They wont know your seed, they can't, thats the point, and seeds have always been 12 words, sorry this happened to you but in the future if a wallet seed you get is less than 12 words don't put anything in it, destroy it.
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:02:42
If you only put in what you could lose, hodl pussy.  If you couldn't afford what you put in its gonna bite you, so have it ready.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:28:52

Fucking dick... I thought it crashed like a motherfucker or something &gt;_&lt;

I thought this sub had leaked into r/Showerthoughts for a second when I read that title.
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:32:09
O_o time for a lambo?

Google MtGox
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:54:17
I mean, you shouldn't be parking money on ANY exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:45:57
So, even if he only mined 1-170, at 50 coins a block (i'd guess he mined more)  That makes the USD value of that bunch of coins 68 million dollars.
Hope he didn't lose em...
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:47:35
its infinitely divisible so it will remain viable even if prices go into the hundreds of thousands.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:32:02
When a previous bubble popped has nothing to do with this or any other "bubble" and people usually end up losing when they buy into a bubble and it pops on them, which is why the term is mostly used in a derogatory manner.  You're not wrong that bubbles change things, but they can bring good and bad.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:37:07
If you're actively trading that's one thing but move any coins you're not trading into your control.  If you don't control them, they're not guaranteed.  Google mtgox and Mark Karpelas.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:15:33
Idk preev averages exchanges from my understanding so someones got it cheaper somewhere.  
Edit: I use coinbase too, I wouldn't leave coin on an exchange but they seem like a good enough choice for purchases and trades.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:51:06
If he lost access to his coins I imagine he's dead... or crazy...
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:50:46
meh, I came back to my 10 being 90, imma start buying a smidge every payday no matter what.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:13:02
Preev shows 7,970 coinbase 8,050 thats a good $100-$150 lower atm then yesterday, I anticipate it going back up to around $8,200 so sure, go for it. it may not be a huge percent but waiting is probably not going to make buying in cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:00:38
Lol bitcoin cash is just another altcoin.  Might as well be doge.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:20:16
Trading is fine too just know anything you trade can possibly be lost.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:27:14
Sounds like a personal problem.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:13:21
I hope you're joking and not actually that fucking stupid, how many times do people need to be told not to invest what they can't fucking afford to lose... 
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:47:27
Up or down?  Yes.
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:29:28
Thats not a real crash... 
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:23:15
But that could be worth .6 bitcoin by then!
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:23:59
An exchange is like a bank an address can act as a bank account (on an exchange) or as a wallet (when held by an individual) if you put your money in another persons wallet, it is in that (watchable but likely anonymous) persons control.  You will know the address it went to but there is no metaphorical gun or cop that can get the money back.
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:04:29
Ih I made a little off it and cashed out cause its high for me to buy in much at least with what I have now.  If it crashes or I get a come up I'd like to be back in but not because I want to trade it, its interesting shit.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:33:16
1 is always 1 but I said worth, it could be worth .1 or even 10
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:05:32
Shit if it goes under $100 i'd be buying as much as I could.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:28:54
Coinbase is actually fdic insured I believe.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:56:59
Or you could sell those cards to gamers for bitcoin :P

I bought 70 dollars worth back in mid-late 2012 and didn't keep track of it.... don't be me -_-
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:41:05
Lol k
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:17:03
Except for the cases where bitcoin was seized...
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:28:20
Can gpu prices go back down now?  Or are alt-coins still gonna fuck us gamers.
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:44:44
But there is a valid lesson here that harkens back to mtgox and people can't get through their thick fucking skulls.  If your money isn't in your possession, it's not actually your money.
Exchanges are a bad place to leave cash or crypto.
Also, don't take out a 2nd mortgage for crypto you fucking numbnuts.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:15:30
lol, "bitcoin could do whatever, i'm not talking out my ass"
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:20:45
No, its not.
