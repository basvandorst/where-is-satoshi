For static websites, it could be possible. But for websites that use databases, it would require some kind of decentralized peer-to-peer operating system, which would be really cool. I'd love to see that one day.

I was lucky to buy most of them back in August, because I was trying to make some money by buying them cheap on my exchange and then selling them on localbitcoins. I didn't have much money before, and if I did, I wouldn't have put it all into Bitcoin. But now I have those coins already, I'm keeping them.

I'd love to be able to spend my coins in more places. But using Bitcoin simply as a store of wealth is still a great utility.

Nice use of technology.

This is quite reassuring that I'm not doing the wrong thing by being safe and simply holding. Thanks.

My reason to sell would only be to profit from the stupid people panicking by buying back in cheaper. Now I think about it, I would only be contributing to the stupidity. I would actually prefer it if such opportunities didn't happen, but unfortunately it's a very nervous market.

Thanks for your advice.

My SO told me to sell my "stupid toy money" back in the summer, and never mention about Bitcoin to her again. I kept my coins, and have never mentioned it to her since. Now she's seeing it all over her Facebook and the news. I feel so smug.

Nice work. Best Bitcoin art I have seen.

I think that Bitcoin is one giant bubble, containing lots of smaller bubbles.

I shouldn't have deleted my comment. I thought it was a bit unfair to people. I would have sold too if I knew such a stupid panic would happen.
Actually I have just under 100 BTC buying in over the past 6 months, holding firm through all the turbulence.

How are you buying? I'm in the UK too but it still takes me a few days to deposit into Bistamp. I requested a prioritized SEPA transfer (which has a £30 fee) on Thursday and I am still waiting.
