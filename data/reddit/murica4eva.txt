I'm right and you're salty! Talk about a pointless defense and offense that works both ways.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:00:04
American businesses will thrive whether you rely on US defense or not. You're using Macbooks because we invented the personal computer. You're using Office 365 because we invented the internet.
We have a lot of influence, and it certainly helps in plenty of ways, but our corporations thrive on American industrial might, not military might. You may start buying Swedish fighter jets though, shrug.

He was far from incompetent, and looking at your username, you're not a very good judge of what passes for decent governance.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:06:01
Oh, ok, and you were salty about Obama with your comment first, by that brilliant metric.
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:19:18
That's true and fine but usually the morons bitching about socialism are Americans acting like Obama was a Soviet style socialist rather than a person fully aligned with us business interests. Against those morons, bringing up Scandinavia is fine.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:09:28
Eh, that particular point is fine by me. I don't like Trump, but Europe has become remarkably un-self-reliant anyways. Russia has about 5% of your GDP and could probably overrun Europe to the Atlantic Ocean in three weeks without US support. The free market is fine at determining where you buy shit from, and if you start thinking about collective defense, great. Pax Americana has been pretty expensive for us.

None of which would matter if btc actually worked.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:51:43
Yes, their company with higher operating costs would definitely win. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:47:24
Your the kinds of person that is going to kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:01:08
Increasing transaction speed/size on the blockchain is a mugs game. Bcash is just pushing the timeframe back a bit and not investing in real solutions, which have to come through another tech...either one added to BTC or another coin. Bcash's 25 tx/sec isn't that much better than bitcoins 3 in the long run, and at a ridiculous cost.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:50
Definitely, and who can say BCH won't develop side chains first anyways. But there are real issues now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:00:59
I have no reason to believe BCH can't develop side chains, especially if devs begin to jump ship. BTC has literally zero market protection except first-mover advantage, to which I highly recommend you read Peter Thiel's book, Zero to One. Do you really believe BTC is going to build the best ship?
Maybe you're confident in that, but I've seen the response to real problems — I got in first at 650 and bought more when it was under 200 USD — and I am not at all confident. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:33:52
Whut? Did he add the word 'does'? Does pretty explicitly stops it from being interpreted that way.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:47:27
Post here with an update when you're done so I make sure to find it please!
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:05:30
I love Segwit, don't get me wrong. I love sidechains too. But will BTC get there first anyways?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:10
Trading is frozen, it will settle down to 3xxx immediately once trading opens.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:51:03
....No. That is not true. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:12
Yeah, but I already have wallets for BCH and my Ledger supports it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:13:12
Completely redundant, except working right now. In the world of modern cryptos, BTC is the redundant network, what it has is first mover advantage and adoption. We'll see if those hold back the flood.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:59:46
Btc will be done before second layer solutions are implemented and in use. I sold all my bcash and hate that community, but that's a roadmap to failure 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:46:16
I sold all my bch but I have no idea why you believe this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:40
Whatever, clever idea.

Oh no, more relevant ads.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:31:20
Segwit is just a tiny band-aid on a gaping wound. Getting CB to Segwit would be awesome, but it won't really fix anything. Meanwhile, they are struggling to keep the actual exchange running — far more of a priority.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:15:23
I think bruteforcing a third of an address would be trivially easy though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:08
How is this interpreted? I thought future could be bought at multiple price points like options? Whats the contract price?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:22
If enough Americans start begging for SEC intervention as people here are doing today, the SEC will intervene sooner. It doesn't have to be "illegal" to change the market a lot. ICO requirements will be set to match the requirements for having an IPO for stock with financial and legal hurdles to prevent fraud and my vision of this whole thing dies a sad death.  I like a free market, more anarchistic vision for crypto, nt a highly regulated one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:20:49
As somone who's been into bitcoin since 2012, my nightmare is finally happening. You think when people start hammering the SEC with requests for intervention, this is going to go the way you want? 
The SEC may not be able to regulate bitcoin, but they can make transacting it illegal and do a lot of things that will crush the BTC markets, and they will, and the fast and more whiny the demands for market intervention start coming in, the sooner. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:41:48
Most con artists don't create real solutions to actual problems
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:42
Literally the last thing cryptos wants or needs is SEC involvement. My nightmare is hundreds and thousands of new people begging for government control and them stepping in .

A source for there being entitled people in show business? People with narcissistic personality disorder for instance are well known to gravitate towards careers where they have fans and admirers. Politician, entertainer, etc. This requiring a source is like requiring a source for the sky being blue. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:56:11
Pay attention: Everyone reading this gets your point. 
You most definitely did not ask for a source for psych evals for anyone. The only thing I said was that narcissists are common in show business and you asked for a source for that. If the problem is poor comprehension, you're welcome for the clarification. If you're just moving the goal posts, you're a moron. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:39:55
Entitled people in show business. Isn't formulaic just because it's common. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:15:30
Don't learn from a few weeks. BTC could easily see 5k again. Just dollar-cost average.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:56:19
It's the first and always will be. In a century it'll be a collectors item.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:11:04
No one knows, but assuming it's anything like everything else that has ever existed, we're in a state of mania and it's going to correct.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:43
Yeah, but it might take longer to get your account verified.
BitStamp is a legit site out of the EU, I'd check them out too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:01
Uh huh. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:30
Probably. Fractions of it at insane values. Frankly, that's a brilliant fucking idea right now, want to start a business?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:17:07
Yeah, we are all pretty bummed about missed opportunities. I tried to buy 5k in Ethereum in October, had some bank problems, it was at 18, now 510. I'd have made 140k. Sigh. 
I told my buddy about it, he got it done, now has 300k I don't.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:01:20


@_date: 2017-11-29 15:04:32
In the past 24 hours people have bought 900,000 bitcoins for $10k or more. If you want one of mine, right now, it will bee $11,300. Please let me know if you have any to sell for 10k, too!
It's hard to buy shit directly with gold too. With that said, many places take BTC but I agree that's not the primary factor driving value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:12
It's the start of it ;)
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:26:15
Yeah, but what are we going to do? I'm holding along with the rest of us idiots and/or visionaries. :D
I think BTC could see 100k. I hope I'm right! But if BTC hit 2k again sometime next year, I wouldn't be at all shocked, either.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:55:15
Try Bitstamp, they are EU. 
We all have that story. I wanted to get 5k of ether at $18, now it's &gt; 500. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:01
Bitcoin hasn't been 20 dollars since 2011 or 2012. But otherwise yeah. 
The most common way is to use coinbase.com, connect a bank account, the you can move money in and out of you checking account to buy BTC. All money is taxed, my friend. But they do rely on you to report it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:25
But always the first.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:58:34
If you're American, Coinbase/GDAX (same company, Coinbase has fees but instant buys, GDAX requires a transfer that takes ~4 days)
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:49:10
You can't see any value in a borderless, near instantaneous digital currency? I promise you, people in countries with currency controls see a lot.
You are judging it from the perspective of a rich, Western nation. The Chinese who face extensive capitol controls and fake exchange rates are not.
Bitcoin is the only way to move money across the internet without a third party.

Eh, I write on Steem with one account. I'm not blind to the issues, but there are still definitely users. I mean, 10 users for the actual platform is probably more than half the top 100.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:31:13
All is hose things are true and it's still one of the few currencies being used as more than a speculation vehicle.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:49:48
No, it doesn't mean that, but we aren't. Chavez and Maduro are.
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:05:07
Sure, but it still has a massive transaction volume and actual users.

@_date: 2017-09-17 04:08:09
Meh. I am very financially responsible, but this whole 6 months of savings thing is nonsense for anyone who makes over 30k a year. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:30:51
I stopped coming here in general because of how heavily filtered at moderated it is. I prefer Bitcoin to bcash, but this community is gross.
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:32:26
I stopped coming to this subreddit for discussion a long time ago because of how filtered and censorship prone it is. It actually makes me a little ill. I'll probably be banned for this, and I support bitcoin over bcash 100%.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:21:49
A 1.5% fee is very high imo, even if fees are necessary. And it's clear a larger and larger number of people are seeing the fee as too high to suit their purpose. And it feels like it's high for no particularly good reason...an artifact of software architecture. 
I won't use a managed mutual fund with a 1% management fee, and I certainly will move to a block chain that saves me 1.5% per transaction. Who here isn't already moving some portion of their coins to other coins? I'm up to about half now. Makes me sad.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:12:43
Interesting. Why a successor coin? Because enabling bitcoin to do what another future coin could do would be too large a fork to absorb?
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:47:50
Just use magic to execute this strategy everyone! 
Can we not defend high fees? No matter what solution we support high fees will be the death if any crypto. These are fungible products.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:44:20
Well, there will almost certainly be legal action against Coinbase. It might be groundless, but if BCC has value, I'd say that a lawsuit is a sure thing.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:58:17
Eh. Philosophically, I think they're doing the wrong thing.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:28:07
I mean, the next fork is the next fork and the next debate is the next debate...it seems pretty obvious segwit + 2mb is a temporary solution anyways, no?
Bitcoin still has very limited adoption. What do you expect to happen if a measurable percentage of the global population begins to use bitcoin? Or do you not see it as a casual transaction mechanism?
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:52:34
You might be right that we need sidechains, but that's a ridiculous definition of a compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:50:38
Cryptos don't need a reserve currency. Whichever one works best and has the most utility is the best one to hold for maintaining value. The idea is that an inferior coin will retain value by what?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:54:42
There's nothing inherent that makes 1MB or BTC a good store of value. Bitcoin is 'gold' that will fall to zero as it's utility does.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:27:28
I don't think those are real things Bitcoin has others do not, except perhaps longevity, which isn't important to me in tech. I work in Silicon Valley, I've seen longevity collapse many, many times. First mover advantage pales in comparison to last mover advantage.
But you're right, I have considered those and moved about half my crypto to other chains because I don't need those things or think they have a premium commanding value.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:18:05
The monetary value of the gift is not the issue.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:44:50
My aunt giving everyone in the family teletubbies would have been equally selfless, but they were still her thing,not ours. I would have accepted mine gratefully, but they would have been a fairly thoughtless gift on her part.
I don't think anyone here is arguing that gifts are more important than family. That's just a red herring. I am merely talking about gifts in isolation. They aren't some taboo subject.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:52:07
I think he's saying most people would. He himself knows about BTC. Giving BTC is like giving someone a gift that you like, rather than them. It's just a little tacky. I know you don't see that.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:27:36
I have no doubt. I don't think anyone in my family would act anything other than politely interested. It is nevertheless an extremely self-absorbed gift.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:07:32
Someone who gave everyone big gift cards would get a thanks too. That does not in anyway imply they are a thoughtful gift. If your gift can only be evaluated a year later, it's probably not a great choice.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:18:31
If you knitted them something, they would at least think you were thinking about them when you chose their gift.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:27:52
Not really, he pointed out all the other gifts had the same value.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:00:09
The monetary value isn't the issue.
