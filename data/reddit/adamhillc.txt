Interesting. Try safari or on mobile to check out. Or watch my video on the project (reddit link) it’s a great initiative to help support some of the 400,000 children displaced by genocide in Myanmar.

Thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:45:12
I also said over next 2 months but the Consensus conference is an indicator for it. So we’ll see. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:43:17
That data was from Fundstrat who is a lot smarter than you. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:29:43

@_date: 2018-05-16 02:58:14
Good luck man! Post consensus 18 boost will be a nice way to kick this off. I’ve been in it but wanted to start race clean so no one can doubt if it’s real. Please subscribe to follow the journey! Think it will take less than 1 year!
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:58:01
Exactly :) thanks for positive comment vs u/galacticrock being toxic. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:56:09
Thanks. Takes 12 hours to make each of these videos. Appreciate the positive feedback. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:46:58
You also shouldn’t do anything I say. Why would you listen to me?
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:59:43
Naw but this will follow journey to hit 10x regardless of how long it takes. I think it will take less than year tho.

@_date: 2018-02-13 03:32:58
thank you so much. really appreciate it. my goal is to do a video each day on crypto :)

It is hard to say for sure but I think that there was an issue with a backup server and they needed to sync it with all of their servers in order to be safe. But to do so they had to shut down. By shutting down abruptly they scared a lot of people hahah! No money was stolen but it makes people worried when this kind of thing happens.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:24:29
I actually talk about that in my video!
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:10:50
Yeah there are a ton of options.

its so strange that this happened but I guess thats the world we live in now where everything is run by computers. but I worry about self implosion - crypto community blowing up crypto community. like let's blame the exchange that made crypto mainstream right? ....

@_date: 2018-04-14 00:54:52
In case any of you are wondering if the Bitcoin Misery Index has a live feed, I Tweeted Tom Lee and he said they are working on it to make it avail more broadly! 
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:51:16
