Crypto as a commodity is over for good IMHO. 
But I've been surprised to see it bounce back multiple times since the early 2013 mania. So who knows, maybe in 2100...
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:23:23
I'm here since 2013 and that's my POV too.

If you guys get way more than the amount of money you're risking, it means all people saving in fiat will be f***ed up in the change. Since it's not fair to the 99%, it will never happen (at least not on a large scale).
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:00:22
For the next 24h maybe...

for large sums, the fees are usually around 0,02%

Most people buying a Lambo didn't do anything so what the difference?

Proof of work is an environmental nightmare. 
What about proof of charity to an NGO? An UNICEF coin would be great in my view.

A pyramid scheme don't last long if more people leave it than people join it. And we will never see lots of people save their money in BTC if the price is more volatile than the S&amp;P500 (even overvalued, it's something that produce 5% of REAL wealth per year).

What a father.

Not yet. At this price, miners are going to move their ASIC to third world countries and make coins with coal...

Greed will kill you guys

As long as Tether keeps printing and injecting fake money, it's heading to $0k

BTC ETFs exist since years 
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:52:49
Nice fake

So it is not an audit.

Late victims of the FOMO, welcome in the scheme! Don't forget to cash out in USDT to lose everything.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:17:22
Hodl faith guys... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:55:23
Basic hooliganism. I hope for them that they don't lose more than they can afford.

The Bitcoin Dip? Which one? It's been dip over dip. CRASH TO THE MOOOON

Currently there is two kinds of people...
Those selling and leaving 
And those doing dollar cost averaging
I let you make the projections
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:56:49
If it will happen again, why don't you sale?

Some say that in Tibet they can be profitable at $1600 accounting electricity and manpower. Can't say for the hardware.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:40:24
Real resistance will be around 6000$ (it's the current cost of mining)
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:48
A lot of fun these last days. 
I am sorry about that but I see the crash and all your stress as a punishment for your greed. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:03:22
If there is not enough miners, difficulty will progressively drop, so cost of mining will drop. Difficulty have a lot of inertia so it might not be profitable to mine for some weeks. (except if you're based in China and mining with coal electricity..)
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:05:34
Currently crypto is losing by all means... 
Lots of scam. Very bad press and more to come with the USDT scandal. Still no use beyond speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:41:14
Simply not enough people entering the scheme :/
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:10:00
Very good idea, let's make a loan and buy some ropes while we have some cash!
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:06:38
The fact that it might stay around or even thrive in the next years don't mean that it will come back to its max. valuation. 
1630s bulbs never recovered their price.

"Our expectations worth more than your USD"
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:18:33
USD worth nothing so you're right. 
It's not as if you could buy food and all with it..
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:54:46
Corrected. Thank you for the suggestion.

If someday I can access the API documentation page...
