data dash, coin mastery, crypto investor, altcoin buzz. Plenty more good ones but i think the ones i mentioned are very rational.

No shit

Why moms?
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:22:01
So it begins
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:49:57
Yes.  4 year cycles are what we look at, and according to the cycle we aren’t taking off till after the halvening. This was not a bad year for bitcoin and the next 2 should be even better
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:59:41
If that’s most of their net worth probably
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:40:24
I wish you were wrong...
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:09:30
If you don’t need it then wait. Short term it may go down a bit more but long term (1-2) years, it has the potential to really take off
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:45:41
This is amazing news but I hope there will be options for people who don’t have over 10m to throw at a cryptocurrency investment 
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:13:46
Bro I wish I could afford flip flops rn
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:27:58
Jesus I really wish I could tell that me from 5 months ago that everything would be ok

All those tiddies are nice but don’t prove shit
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:09:33
I feel you dude
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:18:16
And if it doesn’t happen it’ll be the first time he was wrong since that was posted
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:07:36
Either way, 5 figures is always good
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:47:52
Yeah anyone who still uses the word charlatan probably isn’t the best person to take tech advice  from
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:57:58
The time traveler was right
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:24:46
People have been saying it’s too late since 2014
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:19:51
Let’s say btc combined with the rest of your portfolio does do a 20x, and let’s say that fully happens around 2021-2022. Are you telling me that if you DCA every week or two weeks that by the time that happens you can’t retire in a low cost of living area? Really?
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:40:15
Thank you, a lot of people are shitting on me for my statement about banks being irrelevant which I totally understand because it’s a pretty absurd statement but as someone who has traveled a lot and had to exchange my currency tons of times this is what I see for the future 
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:36:57
Hey thanks man
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:47:56
I figured he was probably talking about one of the digital cash systems that weren't decentralized and ended up failing, and not cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:50:28
Are you referring to my statement about banks becoming irrelevant? I know its an idealistic viewpoint and somewhat far fetched but it is my belief 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:42:54
100% agree 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:13:11
IMO the news coming out Jan-Feb was very bearish up until around when the SEC had that bullish meeting. Coincidentally, thats right where btc bottomed and news started turning very bullish, almost as if it was in an orchestrated fashion0_o

We made it! Let’s see the meme
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:24:31
I have felt that for the exact reasons you stated, Croatia has been snubbed in past cups. But this time around the refs seemed fair and Croatia was finally able to show the world what they could do. IMO the handball was the right call just very unfortunate on Croatia’s part, as was the free kick that France scored on and the own goal header by Mario Mandzukic. Mistakes cost the team the game but for the first time I feel as if the refs had no part in it.
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:47:56
The Croatian team played much better but essentially gifted France their first two goals. It’s just the way she goes
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:08:43
It’s the 1 million club, there will only be 21 million btc so if you have 21 you have one millionth of the total supply
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:47:15
Up or down for sure. Unless it stays the same
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:54:34
More than 50% down from its ath I’d say it’s a great time if ur hodling long term

Would increasing the block size interfere with segwit LN shoor sigs and other implementations? And would it require another hard fork?
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:00:56
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:37:58
I’m not very knowledgeable about the coding part of crypto but have been following this narrative since the fork mania pretty intensely. I think first segwit LN shoor sigs and other implementations need to reach high levels of adoption and see how it scales before increasing the block size. Also if increasing the block size does not interfere with the implementations listed then I am all for it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:49:45
This is exactly what I had envisioned for btc’s future. Payments a la Apple/Samsung pay where you pull out your phone tap the screen and pay instantly. Next step is broader retail adoption 
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:32:44
If the average cost to mine one BTC is 6k and the price is 4K then it doesn’t matter how much you are selling. And no a lot of miners aren’t selling huge amounts because they are everyday people making fractions of BTC. Honestly do you even know what you’re saying?
