Assuming you read my post you would see that I am not a mod. And, you clearly don't have a martyr complex seeing as how you think that I said you have "no claim to complain." Seems like you put those words in my mouth to make yourself feel more persecuted. (My bad) I also don't remember saying anything about anyone else's situation about being banned. 
Since we are talking about that seem "funny", I think its "funny" that one of the above posters (rjones85) seems to have never posted before or since giving you "props". 
("Good for you. Provoked or not, it's an act of civil disobedience. Props to you man." - Rjones85)
Also since you mention in your original post that "I created a second account for the purpose of appealing the ban and was thus banned again."  I seem to remember a "rjones85" for a tad biton CoinChat. That leads me to believe that you created this persona to back up your BS whiny claims. 
( I hope you think you are cool. Or maybe one of your made up personas {maybe Rjones85}, because its not coming off that way on the outside.)
People... bottom line, don't listen to this guy. Go check out CoinChat.org for what it is and form your own opinion. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 05:22:46
Thanks enabler! 
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:39:52
After reviewing your posts that you put up its clear that you deserved your ban that time. I have no clue about your first or second ban, but if that is an example of how you conducted your self on there on a regular basis then I wouldn't want you around either. 
I am not a MOD or owner or anything but a sometimes user. Although I wasn't there for this drama, I do remember you in general. You were generally a jerk. And that is shown by this whine session you brought to Reddit. I hadn't noticed that you weren't around until I stumbled onto this.
I find the place pretty accepting of people, hell they let me hang around and I'm generally an abrasive person. I have been Muted before, but I admit I deserve it sometimes. They do a great job of sending me warning when Im getting too far down the wrong hole. ( I hold some pretty strong opinions that aren't exactly commonly held or agreed with). Honestly, I have never felt "censored". 
 As you can see from your posts about some other site I have never heard, you must have a martyr complex or something. 
Seems to me the same thing happens to you everywhere, I wonder what the common factor is..... :-/
But for anyone that hasn't been to CoinChat.org, it's a cool place with people from Europe and the US all around the globe honestly. The people rock, and know a lot about cryptos and computers in general. A lot of very educated people with degrees in there, rubbing elbows with silly dumbasses like me. C-ya's there. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 22:39:42
I had that idea, but you made those guy look slick.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:19:36
I do believe you are seeing a slice of reality, now.  My vested interest is not wanting good chatters to be turned off by your BS. Simple. 
Actract the good, weed out the... Yous
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:38:22
Another user used the same word as you....  within minutes........ seems to be a pattern. or not, I don't care.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:32:38
If I post do I get that tip? I hope....
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:25:34
I hate cheese. its wrong that stuff exists. and don't get me started on sour cream, it says that the cream soured in the name! wtf?
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:50:41
Tdeo is right. I use CoinChat.org and have been using it since it was Dogechat.com, they never asked me for my email or any info on my part or asked me to buy anything from anyone. It really is just a chat that has some pretty cool people. The btc is awarded randomly to people just chatting. Tdeo is right the site funds itself from people buying colors and never asks for any cash or btc from you ever. There is a good mix of people in there, some very educated people and dumb asses like me being silly. But I am one of the people that go there to chat, not for the btc, this place wont make you rich but it will make you some friends. 
Go check it out if you haven't already.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:41:35
Ummm, ok. But, that's cool that your proud of being a troll. I envy you, must be nice to know thy self so well.
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:44:06

@_date: 2014-11-04 21:26:29
Oh, I know nothing of that subreddit, or the rules, so I cant say your are wrong or right.
@_date: 2014-05-14 07:32:09
Wow, that's a neat Idea! I hope BTC tipping gets to be a huge thing. This is a step in the right way I think. Make cryptos fun and entertaining to folks on the net.
Tipping for life!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:42:00
I thought this was a Bitcoin and Gravy spinoff.
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:31:10
lot a lot in the grand scheme of things. I made .1 btc for transcribing a podcast. then I used that to do some trading and made it grow. I was up to .6 btc. so its not the amount of btc, but how important what little I had was. sucks. People are scoulding the victims about ont keeping their coins on an exchange, but those transfer fees will nickel and dime me to death. but it looks like I paid the ultimate fee I guess. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:47:54
Hell yeah! sending satoshi, like turtle shells from Yoshi. Nigga!

He was trying to help, and you seem to be grinching it up all over the place. OP, you can secret santa some mbtc my way if that helps you. (have a happy significant religious holiday of your choosing!)
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:51:21

@_date: 2014-11-06 05:28:41
Yeah!!! and fit this up there too buttcoin! thanks bro
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:09:58
Yeah, some day. I wish I was more technically inclined, so I could help develop some things to make this easier. But, sadly I cant.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:23:36
no sir, I think You and your comments are BS. But I also understand that douche bags do mental backflips to convince themselves that they are not Douche bags. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:29:48
I am repeating myself because it is imperative that those who need help seek it.
@_date: 2014-10-21 12:02:40
Id spend it all on Slothcoins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:49:54

@_date: 2014-10-25 15:10:05
shit. im too late. I got robbed by mintpal, and really need some sort of start up up capital to try to rebuild my tine .6 btc I lost.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:33:51

AHHH yeah!
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:59:33
Bring it to PM? Why are you not able to stand behind your comments? I am not white washing anything, just not letting you bad mouth a cool group of people in your one man show of "AssHat:the musical". For all it takes for douche bags to exist is for a good man to do nothing. I think that's how it goes, in referral to you for sure. 
And as far as anything about some Inputs.Io, I have no clue about that since I am just a user and not a mod. So I don't know what kind of info youd like to hear to make you feel better. 
Also my "blanket defense" seems to me that my points are very clear and to the point with links to back up what I'm saying. 
So feel free to keep wasting your own time justifying your own back-assward view of things.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:06:16


Wait? who is saying this? CConrad0825? Rjones85? or walteRJONES83?

@_date: 2014-10-24 05:56:55
send all your btc to me, then you will be back at square one.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:49:35
You Paint yourself in a bad light brother. Ill tell you right now and all that are reading, my user handle is BeavisFan..... So not a mod, I have nothing to hide. When did I say that you were banned for being a jerk? I said you are a jerk from how I remember it. You posted the clear reason why you were banned in your own transcript. 
Where is this "tons of information" I seem to have? Im going off of what you have written and posted.
I also am going on logical thinking, Such as the Fact that the other Original Poater of the thread  seems to be a user named "walteRJONES83" and also seems to have only 3 posts that are only in that thread. Seems rather similar to your buddy "RJONES85"........
Your clearly a chump who needs to create a world where you don't suck. So keep telling us how your not a martyr or maybe just make another account to back that up also......
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:34:32
Commanders take on a lot of responsibility, I salute you. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:12:56
If this IS how you view things, then you clearly have a much deeper psychological issue that I am not able to help you with. 
How is it "blindly" if im there and have fun while there, and have seen it and you first hand?
You seem to think that you are such a martyr that I would be an undercover mod or something and im out to get you. (paranoia)
Me stating "I'm not a mod, but..." only proves that I am not a mod. Clearly. 
You seem to be making less and less sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:20:40
Please refer to my previous advice.
