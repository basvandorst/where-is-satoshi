Not only soldered motherboards. 
The brain behind Apple, one of the pioneers of modern personal computers and what not.
Disrespectful comment.

What does have inherent value according to you?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:56:37
What on earth makes you think it isn't? 
Nobody knows, pretty much the point.
Making quite a few bold statements in your above post without knowing jack shit or backing it up with sources.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:55:19
Logic. Okay... :’)

Counting all transactions for buying bitcoin with money from banks, grouping it for each unique person
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:12:11
So how is it that youre attempting to make people owning stuff without intrinsic value look bad? Youre contradicting yourself here.
I didnt even start on the other things you summed up, just took one out. Trying to talk bitcoin and such down is fine but dont state it as logic. Clearly not the thing that you are best at.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:03:55
So you own no money?
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:59:13
Though very easy to reuse, spin it around in 2 days and gain karma :D

1% of a bitcoin is 0.01 btc..
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:43:44
Also missing them vertical lines..... 
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:31:44
Maybe when you do a random search his profile appears at top 1% of the results? Or maybe he created his profile earlier in time than the other 99%? Who knows!
@_date: 2018-10-03 13:34:18
Then it’s still possible, just not the right thing to do ;-)
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:25:14
Why would it not be possible?
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:18:19
yeah poor guy, ending up with more money still than he had before
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:48:21
What is bitcon
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:31:15
Obviously implied. Interesting combination of words 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:40:49
Could bitcoin do and fold my laundry please
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:18:35
Honestly I'm asking a question and finding a comment interesting, but hey keep it going &lt;3
Nevertheless, even if original poster is saying that. Its right that it doesnt have to go up because it went up that time, goes for the opposite as well ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:38:59
I learned that if I have to assume, I'm unsure so I'd better ask if I wanna know.
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:27:21
The last sentence pretty much says what I was going to say indeed :) talking about a top 10 stupid comments lol
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:30:29
Unicorns are shitting christmas trees on the 25th and 26th of december this year
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:56:00
Where does he state the latter happening?

Buying it
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:55:08
This comment is the reason I read these threads.
Looking trough comments to find 'Bullish'.
Always makes me laugh
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:26:04
your posting history just made my day xD
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:57:43
Thank you for your opinion
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:34:27
Doesn't growth need some kind of catalyst though?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:36:37
Yeah its bad that google doesnt want to run ads for scam icos which make this whole market look bad for, for example, new people 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:11:24
One guy will eventually be right and claim he knows it all xD
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:53:33
Does that mean above is what you want us to do?����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:44:14
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:28:15
Yeah but why skip some more FUD right?
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:32:44
So where are the other reports about G20? Kinda quiet?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:59:17
Where did Chad go, I can't deal with these kind of open ends :(
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:49:01
How is a correction a crash again?
Fill me in here redditor for 1 week
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:04:02
Omg bouncing ball pattern confirmed! Bullish!
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:35:23
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:59:00
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:26:27
Yes actually :) I think the G20 meeting is something many await
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:23:56
Banks pay you interest - for now -
A subtle yet pretty important change in your sentence.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:00:27
What makes you think banks will keep paying interest and it won’t be turned around? You pay them to store your money.
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:55:57
dont u mean owns?:s
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:49:23
So, when is something overvalued?
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:19:09
Also read on reddit theyre never doing it again since everything has been paid off and rest will be auctioned.. :/
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:35:16
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:19:07
It rather says blockchain is here to say.. not bitcoin :/
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:36:06
And i upvoted top comments + vegeta
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:01:06
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:44:38
Gee thanks! What a good story!
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:30:10
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:49:09

@_date: 2018-04-06 08:14:17
Why is there a petition for something that's FUD lol..
India is not banning crypto at all.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:14:48
A slow death for the what... 4th or 5th time? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:19:46
Whats bit coin?
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:16:22
Let me write an article about that and post it on @_date: 2019-05-27 15:15:19
