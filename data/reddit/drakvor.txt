Of course they should care though, every time something like this happens they risk potential loss in marketshare to another exchange that can handle it.

It's not like you just can anymore.  You have to use their website to turn in the homework a lot of times as well.  Only get access to turn in if you buy the whole book with it.

Greedy pricks.  Designed to siphon off the common person trader.  Rich get richer.

1 BTC = 1 BTC still

What?  You took your coins out, which gives you access to both BTC and BCH wherever you put them.  I don't see how it's shady or you don't get anything.

I'd be happy enough to have a similar sized jar of pennies even now.

Or another .0019 BTC which I'd never say no to.

I responded to a guy talking about a moose antler standard.  You can find moose in forests, so in this case yes money would literally grow in the forest.  Hope that clears things up for you.

We're allowed to own properties.  I personally would just pay the house off straight away too.  One of the reasons people might not pay it off is if they believe they can make more money off investing than the house mortgage's interest rate.

Money literally grows in the forest!  As close to money growing on trees as we can get!

GDAX, it's coinbase's exchange.  It's very easy to get used to and you will be paying significantly less fees or even no fees at all if you look into Limit Orders.  I've been watching whatever this is for the past few days on GDAX and occasionally I lose real time data feed, but you still have access to the market and the loss of feed is rare.  It hasn't crashed and locked me out like Coinbase itself is.
