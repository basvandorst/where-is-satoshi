In case of wildfire or earthquake the Winklevoss twins will make sure my bitcoin is safe. 
Got it.
What is the mode in which I will be paid?
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:38:44
Right? So why buy it (COIN)?
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:23:58
Did I ever say an offline machine was not a form of cold storage? No.
Nothing I said was inaccurate. 
And NO multi-sig is NOT safer than having your bitcoin on paper stored in a safe location.

Buy bitcoin and put it in a paper wallet.
This is more secure than any other method. 
I don't see why paying the Winklevoss twins to hold my bitcoin + paying brokerage fees is worth it. 
In fact this (COIN) is the antithesis of what bitcoin is all about. Having control (responsibility) over your own money.

What's the public address of your paper wallet?

So your grandparents will buy "COIN" vs just buying bitcoin and printing it out on paper? This line of thinking is nonsensical because if your grandparents can't figure out the print button on their computer why the fuck would they buy a cryptocurrency based on hashing out blocks to receive a reward for solving a computer based algorithm to begin with?

Thanks, and I hope you have good luck as well.
Some people seem to think cloud mining is a scam so I'm just trying to get some objective critical feedback. Just looking to be educated before I take the jump.
I'll look into Vault of Satoshi too. Thing I like about Petamine is that there isn't a contract.

I saw him at the Farmers Market today as I was walking in he was walking out. He had a small bag of avocados and a snack sized bag of bacon flavored Lays potato chips, the kind you can find in a standard vending machine. We exchanged the normal pleasantries "how's your day" he asked with a half smile, I replied "eh, same old same old". The Ford Focus he got into seemed off for some reason. It was only later I remembered his rear break light was out. His chestnut brown hair seemed unkempt more than usual for this time of the day and I found that odd. Aside from that he's doing pretty well with a new diet and rigorous exercise routine.

I'm not a rocket scientist or nothing but after reading this report I have concluded that, yes, something happened at Mt. Gox and someone conducted themselves in a manner their mother would not approve of. They should shame on themselves. 
With that said, bring Willy back so we can go to the moon! I want to try this all again but selling at the TOP this time.

And for some reason the premium is worth it (premium COIN will charge + commission from your broker)? 
Printing a paper wallet is like 1, 2, 3 and is 100% secure. 
Thanks for the response though.
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:16:02
It's easy and free to secure it yourself with a paper wallet. Probably easier than logging into your brokerage account and buying COIN.
It would also be more secure.
So this thing makes no sense to me.

Cold storage - aka "paper wallet" is the most secure way to store bitcoin. 
Now if you have a paper wallet with $1,000,000 and leave it in your unlocked car in Detroit Michigan and your car gets stolen well you're fucked. But it's your money so I'm assuming you would take precautions in how you safe-guard it. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:24:59
I get it. But if the most secure way of storing your bitcoin is in a paper wallet (cold storage) than why am I going to pay the Winklevoss twins to do that? 
You're literally paying a premium for a less secure way of storing bitcoin you can easily buy somewhere else. If I make a paper wallet and store them somewhere safe, that is much more secure than saying....I trust someone else with it. 
Bitcoin is all about being in control of your money. If I buy COIN than the Winklevoss twins are in control of my money NOT me.
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:48:27
Well if a thief is going to cut off my fingers and pull out my pubic hair and force feed them to me....I better buy COIN. Much safer.
Thanks. I feel much better about buying COIN now. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:32:54
What is the benefit of buying COIN vs. buying actual bitcoin on bitfinex or coinbase or huobi or anywhere else? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:04:44
Will the Winkle twins pay me in bitcoin when I sell my shares?
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:02:06
Well you have to buy the shares with bitcoin. I've held bitcoin for about 3 years now. Now...with petamine, for every unit you own you get paid (in bitcoin) a portion of the bitcoin they mine...every day. That's appealing to me.
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:58:56
You don't have to spend too much time looking around to find ordinary people who lose wealth in ways other than bitcoin. You can't prevent stupid. 
People can buy whatever they want, I'm a libertarian and I support freedom of choice. If people want to buy the Wink trust in bitcoin I won't oppose it. If someone chooses to buy it, I actually support that they exercise that liberty.  
I'm trying to discern the BENEFIT of doing so. What is my benefit as a consumer buying "COIN"? Because all I see are unnecessary fees.
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:14:03
So what you're saying is....
It will be easier to buy bitcoin on say, Fidelity, than to buy bitcoin on coinbase (and do 2 extra steps to make a legit cold storage wallet)
Now assuming I buy 1 share of "COIN" and decide to sell it in a year. Will I be paid in bitcoin or dollars by the Winkle trust?
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:46:15
I will go on the record saying that 100s of billions will flow into bitcoin in the next 6 months, and then trillions, and then...to the moon!
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:34:10
Why buy the Winkle Trust vs. actual coins on Coinbase? 
Where is my benefit as a consumer looking to get his feet wet?
