It will always look like [this:]( Because there will never be "full" blocks. "Full" blocks are *only* a Bitcoin Core problem.

Bitcoin Cash will work for merchants, easily. This is why merchants are dropping Bitcoin and adding Bitcoin Cash. Consider yourself enlightened.

Didn't know that effective mining was a bug. What is next? Is having no mempool backlog also a bug? Is low fees a bug? How can there be inflation on a finite 21 million coin cap? The same shit will happen to Legacy Coin too, only it might take centuries longer because miners are smart and will stop supporting this ancient bullshit.

Read the charts my friend.

That was the best you could do? No comment on the cooperate takeover? Only questioning volume, which is empirical and you can even look it up...my fuck, I am sorry for your loss. Next time you see a late night infomercial you might want to use your brain, lest you be scammed.

"Temporarily" raising fees? You must be new to Bitcoin. Fees were never an issue until blocks became full, which happened years ago. Thankfully Bitcoin Cash removed a 1MB spam filter and now zero fee transactions are the norm on the largest Bitcoin chain. I would suggest that you sell your Legacy Coin for Bitcoin Cash before it is too late, before the transaction fees and confirmation times are too high, and before this bubble of speculation pops. It will pop soon, when the community realizes that they are participants in a malicious takeover/scam coordinated by a private and bank funded company known as blockstream.

Because negotiating, basic discussion, and even free speech are banned on this sub and on reddit. This is why Segwit will never pass, it's too dirty to even mention outside of the safe-space monitored by u/spez and u/theymos.

Maybe when this approach fails they can all apply for jobs at EA games, and leave bitcoin alone. Users know what they want, they don't need a coreporate master making their decisions for them.

You remind me of Jay-Z when he headlined a concert for Hillary. You are simply a celebrity and people don't care about your corrupt cause. How much are they paying you?
