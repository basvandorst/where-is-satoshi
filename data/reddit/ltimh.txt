I wouldn’t use TrueCrypt. Haven’t heard of VeraCrypt, but iirc there was a big flaw in TrueCrypt that allowed everything to become unencrypted.

Happy birthday btc! I remember first finding out about bitcoin, reading an article in MaximumPC about how the price had reached about $20. If only we knew the places it would go then...

This is what I’m thinking, too. It’s a good estimate

Exactly. Probably a pretty easy A for undergrad courses.

What are these made out of to be $7.99? Someone must be making a huge profit

Classic scam. This is total bs, don’t give away your $/btc
