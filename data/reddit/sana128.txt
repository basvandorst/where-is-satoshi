@_date: 2017-02-15 18:10:34

@_date: 2017-02-10 18:41:49

@_date: 2017-02-18 18:56:21
My tea leaves showing me something else, OP dont worry.. invest 100%. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:43:22
seed is your private key u can use it with other wallets , at least for ledger.  
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:56:21
we should start a petition, I am thinking of change.org. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:58:52
no people, will use it!
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:28:39
For example in short term cons,
* Volatility
* Low mass market recognition 
* Limited acceptance
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:30:55
Lucky you, I wish we had something like bitcoin when we were growing up, wasted too much money on booze and girls. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:59:58
I dont think an average person will understand. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:11:43
Thats not how you become a billionaire.

@_date: 2017-02-10 16:27:32
How could you save 1100 while im living paycheck to paycheck? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:45:44

@_date: 2017-02-26 22:36:33

@_date: 2017-02-10 17:09:47
I am not going to argue with you buddy. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:13:06
wait .. Nigerian prince thing isnt real ??
@_date: 2017-02-18 16:24:01
Its always pleasure to read your letters.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:30:19
only 2 people know this. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:53:18
Brought thousands of $ worth ETH at once, price went down the next week. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:08:27

@_date: 2017-02-05 17:30:18
what are the technological barriers it facing right now ? 
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:17:31
sad to hear that.. me be he's in trouble; Im sending more money. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:23:40
Everything is good but you need to learn how to use a camera phone buddy. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:51:11
Seems [legit]( 
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:42:21
So I will not double send? Are u sure about this?
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:05:59
people will kill for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:50:11
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:30:02
Buy like 90% now, if it goes up it will go up 300%, and if its going down I don't think it will drop more than 25% and there will be room to recover still. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:05:05
Big media are like, let's get some 19 century economists talk about Bitcoin and ruin their reputation till death. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:46:38
this is nice , thanks
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:05:49
Can u share your imaginary girlfriend with me too ? please ? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:05:09
HODL like 3 years and you will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:34:19
Someone should invest on a company in india to search "bitcoin ETF" 24x7. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:21:05
I have done hundreds of transactions and every time I freak out till get conformations, what if a miss (paste) one character or did some other stupid stuff ? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:48:56
there's something called USDT in polo, you can exchange it any time to any crypto. (well most of it). 
@_date: 2017-02-02 07:30:29
1000 sats = 1$
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:31:52
what are the private keys ? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:54:55
Thanks for helping with math. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:48:37
This is true, if it wasn't reddit, i would never know Bitcoin or many other "useful" things. My friends are all normal people having normal lives and take no pleasure digging about alternative currencies , so there will be zero chance to  even see a facebook post about it. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:23:04
I know its a catchy title, but im not in a business of editing titles. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:38:45
I think in this case they will wait till polo get hacked so it's closed. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:31:06
I know , that meant to be a joke. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:13:12
Tea leaves 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:35:40
Seriously guys I know ETF decision will show up somewhere in SEC page, bud does anyone know exactly where I should look? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:44:18
Gemini auctions, can recommend, I personally brought few million $ worth BTC back in 2014. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:21:49

@_date: 2017-03-05 21:25:51

@_date: 2017-03-05 21:22:20
May be we are all fucked up and "they" knew it. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:17:04
NO, I mean I have to keep it on polo for stop limit , how secure is their system ? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:46:29
I stored all my coins in self destructing PC, so good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:19:42
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:25:16
correct answer 
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:11:46
If this is true,  I don't want his 0.1btc 
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:15:10
Thats why im diversifying exchanges :) 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:03:04
ETF going to be approved or rejected pretty soon!
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:46:41
none, well I dont know how one can become a millionthair.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:11:46
thanks so much! 
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:36:42
Nice try sathoshi. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:36:16
Time to buy more... certainly undervalued even now. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:51:21
ok I wasn't sure abt that..thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:36:17
He said China out of the game
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:26:42
buy now, u will loose very less compare to a potential increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:52:49
It went to the moon and came back.. sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:23:03
or a flood. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:40:33
You clearly managed to stay away from  last whole month!
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:00:00
too much emotional distress 
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:42:05
Thanks for the response, so my only safe option is to keep cryptos in my wallets, but I wonder what will happen if theres a huge price drop and everyone wants to transfer their coins to the exchanges. Will that completely exhaust the infrastructure (blocks)? I wish there's a safe alternative.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:17:24
whose bottom ? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:00:45


WTF, It will not cool down if there's any hope of getting approved , delaying means there's more chance of getting approved. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:04:01
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:51:27
!remind me next month. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 04:14:26
This idiot conveniently forgot that normal people don't wanna store their bitcoin in their own wallets because it's new and most of the upper middle class old people only use computers to browse internet and do their spreadsheets. And we also pay banks to keep our dollars (even though it's only in paper).  So my point is ETF will be a huge deal for technically incompetent risk takers. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:28:07
Ya sorry apparently they updated the procedure. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:11:31
Nice try SCC do your own research 
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:27:53
But then I have to keep my coins in exchanges 
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:26:48
theres something called GOLD, but its too heavy. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:09:22
How safe to keep my coins at polo ? arent they have cold wallets or something ? I wanna keep some on stop limit. whats my best option ?
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:27:33
Not if he start buying 
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:42:19
They will do a reddit AMA.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:24:12
Ok now everybody like, I am going to buy the dip, I suspect if there's ever going to be a dip, specially not in the initial period. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:34:13
Why the fuck go only one year? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:59:55
atleast $11, already happened with fake news.

@_date: 2017-03-06 00:08:21

@_date: 2017-03-03 15:45:56
I already spent money partying! 
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:00:24
op is worth more than that ;)
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:23:24
My gut feeling is this will be decided by the end of the day today! 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:07:37
They used to toss a coin in situations like this, but that may have changed now.
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:09:19
I guess atleast someone is partying .. how much are u HODLing ?
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:04:50
hey dad :) 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:35:38
Behalf of all hodlers I accept this. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:08:23
WTF? 3 days more to get rich ? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:15:54
Because he said so, no more questions please.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:59:01
You know that SEC will go through all related reddit posts before give an approval right ? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:31:22

@_date: 2017-03-08 15:59:45

@_date: 2017-01-07 06:15:35
I love this guy.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:27:32
Bitcoin constantly changing value. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:10:11
just tell him that project failed and bitcoin worth literally nothing, and exchange all of his private keys for a  pizza. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:35:55

I wish they had auto buying feature like in coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:35:30
I will pay $10 more to whatever this guy offer
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:11:43
do u really think it could go that low ? now we have multi millionaires  invested in to BTC and the are not panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:41:12

Including me ?
@_date: 2017-01-11 23:22:17
interesting question. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:43:44
If you dont have the password or seed its not your bitcoin. 
why dont you calm down and write all of the passwords in a paper and try one by one ?
next time use a free password manager like keepass. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:03:53
asking for a friend too, he might sell it for a fair price. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:14:45

Im guessing you are from canada , I want to buy few coins when price go down again and considering my options. Just signed up with Quadriga CX (never used it before). Any specific reason that you are using CoinBase? 
Im relying on the ratings on this site (dont know how accurate it is)

Im not an expert , but most people say hardware wallets like TREZOR(expensive), Ledger (cheap) or you can run Electrum (free) offline (cold storage).
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:56:40
and drug dealers + pyramid schemes 
@_date: 2015-11-26 04:48:04

@_date: 2015-11-11 23:30:30
Haha 
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:31:44
Im new to bitcoin and used GoCelery few times (for small amounts), Im just curious what funding method you used and why didn't you buy it from an exchange ? 
@_date: 2015-11-30 04:23:21
one million years ago today people start to colonize India and the Middle East and then spread to Europe.

@_date: 2017-05-27 19:10:56
Is that it?
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:44:34
Question is when. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 10:56:41
I already purchased a Ledger HW.1 and was planning to use their app with it. But now I think I will get added functionality if I use GreenAddress+Ledger HW.1 . Would you recommend such a combination ? (basically Is there any chance that i might screw things up?) 
@_date: 2015-11-15 03:09:59
you have some rich "friends"

What's the advantage of this over Ledger Chrome app?
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:48:05
Vitalik is satoshi :)
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:02:14
I spend more money on bitcoin transactions than paid for banks to have service for months.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:19:26
all we need is one sathoshi 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:25:21
Nooo lol watch it again (the original).
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:07:53
half decent ICO will rise more money than that. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:19:49
I think you misunderstood my question. If theres any software or product that i can buy with a fixed amount of btc, since the value of btc getting low now im paying less $. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:44:04
so you would wait til it drop to $1 to do that, why not wait till 50 cents or 25 ? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:46:35
You can try.
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:53:53

@_date: 2016-07-10 00:58:04
My account got restricted because I screwed up with bank account. but they weren't helpful and took me more than a month to set up again. I basically moved to another exchange.
