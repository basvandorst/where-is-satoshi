Is there a bitcoin tipbot system around here? I haven't seen it in action. All I ever see is the Doge, Fedora, and Nyancoin tipbots... o.O

Compromised CC: They're talking about compromised credit card info. In other words, they're assuming that since you are making a statement about ease-of-access, that you are using stolen credit card numbers.
I'll go ahead and agree with you though. Ease of access is really key with any sort of digital goods or even a currency. The real attraction is that it is supposed to be a quick and easy solution. It's the reason that Netflix, Spotify, and Steam are so successful. There's plenty of security in the background, but as an end user, I have to do very little to access the service.
Bitcoin seems to have a very steep access curve. The common viewpoint seems to be that the end user should be the one doing the research and ensuring their own security. While I support the concept of individual accountability, I'm not sure that that's what the general public wants. It does seem very strange to me that in this age of instant information and lightning-quick turnaround, there isn't a terribly simple way to purchase Bitcoin (at least that I've seen). Give me the Google Wallet version of Bitcoin transactions and I'm in, but much more than that makes it more of a hassle than just carrying around some cash in my pocket.
