I know you just threw it in as an example, but if a company pays 50 employees in one bitcoin transaction, everyone would know what everyone else makes.

I'm a home miner paying ~8c/kwh. Using S3's that are past break even, it currently cost me about ~$111 to mine 1 btc. If next difficulty jump is 10%, it will cost me ~$122.

I've actually fixed a few of those. I usually end up finding the same file elsewhere and then go fix the torrent. My upload isn't the fastest, but it gets the job done. I just hope I put a smile on at least one of those 100+ leechers faces thinking a seeder would never come. Is there a group or subreddit of people that go around fixing stuck torrents?

I don't understand why more people didn't vote for the "move to another pool like BTCGuild" option. Just because p2pool or something like it seems to be the final answer, doesn't mean we have to head that route right now. They could make the move to btcguild over night. No having to worry about getting p2pool to work. BTCGuild's uptime is like 99.99%. Adding more hash to BTCGuild while taking away from ghash would eliminate a lot of variance. If we can more evenly distribute hashrate amongst the major pools, we can wait til the p2pool software improves.

Mine generated over 21btc during peak prices last December. 21btc even at today's price is much more than the original $1333 I invested.
