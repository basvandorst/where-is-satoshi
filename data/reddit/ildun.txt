OP stands for **O**riginal **P**oster - which, on Reddit, is the user who posted a post (in this case you). The OP has a coloured background behind their username in most subreddits (in this case a blue background).
Sometimes the term OP is also used for the first commenter in a chain of comments, but usually (including in this case) it means what I said above.

No, the website will stay as it is (at least for the moment). The website is owned by Armory Technologies, Inc. (ATI), and neither Farhod (goatpig) nor Alan Reiner (etotheipi) have the authority to modify that website. Something to do with licensing issues and the like, not exactly sure what's going on there.


&amp;nbsp;  
Basically, Farhod's Bitcoin Armory should be regarded as completely seperate from Alan's Bitcoin Armory.  
Farhod is apparently also planning to do a complete rewrite of the Bitcoin Armory code (and he has already changed the license for 'his' Bitcoin Armory from GPLv3 to MIT).

isn't the OP with the zero fee-problem, but is - in case you hadn't noticed (or perhaps you accidentally replied to the wrong comment).
