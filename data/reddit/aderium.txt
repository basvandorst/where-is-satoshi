What’s up with the smart font remarks. 
It’s a good question for a newbie and deserves a good response, which I don’t have. Why get into this crypto world if fees are so high when cryptoers brag about the value of disassociating from current centralized fiat market ??
Ps I am a cryptoer but sometimes it’s like Santiago invited the world to the party and the door is always slammed because you are not welcomed.

Still the question is legit

It’s for people only if it can be used. Can it be used with all these fees ? Oh wait it can’t onlybthe rich that move tones of money don’t care about the high fee. So a newbie who has so much to learn can’t even afford to test out and move to a wallet or move to another wallet before they understand the first one was not the right one, you know with Segway and other options. Oh wait I lost all my money in fees!! Why is bitcoin good in the first place ?? Would like a good response not some idiot one

I am not complaining about the fees. I am an avid supporter of Bitcoin. What I am annoyed about is how there is little respect for the newbies which this crypto needs to embrace and educate. This Beta is BEHIND technologies that are making it old and there seems to me little adaptation of easy curve fast deployment Bitcoin for viability before some other Crypto shoots to the top as it happens over and over again.
