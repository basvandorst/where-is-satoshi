Also, the potential for abuse here is staggering and that bit reads like "You might not be able to trade like you think and you'd have no way of knowing it was us manipulating the market (potentially solely through inaction)".
At best, Coinbase/GDAX is the myspace of crypto exchanges. Useful, but unreliable, and it'll get replaced by something that doesn't go down every time there's a +/- 20% bump.

That's currently the market rate. It's been that high for awhile and shows no signs of getting lower.
If you're trying to move value to another exchange, use ETH or LTC. Both have low fees and fast confirmations and you can re-buy bitcoin once you get it there. If you're looking to buy something with bitcoin, you're better off selling it for Fiat currency and using that instead.

No, it took them 4 years to decide they didn't want to play a game that they can't stack the deck in. Undoubtedly there were people very interested in making this happen and thus drug out the process.
That said, bitcoin's current price will likely bounce back nicely because we don't need an ETF to trade it freely. This is the big difference between BTC and other ETF-able things.

256mb blocks wouldn't be that expensive. It would take awhile to download, sure, but once the chain was in sync you could purge most of it and not have to store it long term.
Also by the time the network was generating that kind of tx volume, that larger block size wouldn't be a problem sure to Moore's Law. (transistor density and therefore compute power doubles every year, and it's been historically more like 9 months).

Or just transfer to something that doesn't have transaction backlog.
Especially if you're moving exchange to exchange. I go BTC-&gt;ETH-&gt;transfer-&gt;ETH-&gt;BTC constantly for way, way under what it'd cost to go BTC the whole way.
It probably won't always be like this, but for now, be smart, think with your noodler, and avoid fees.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:08:10
LTC is also a good option if where you're transferring it to doesn't have ETH deposits/trading.
The thing is, when you're talking about transfer safety, you have to think about potential value lost while in transit. BTC performs well at this, but transfers can take a long time, so there's risk. ETH transfers very fast, and is fairly price-stable because it's higher in value than other alts. LTC transfers quickly, but doesn't have the price/volume insulation that ETH has.

That's not how I read it at all actually. It seems like what is saying is that there isn't a market for 3rd party trust needed for off chain scaling in bitcoin.
This makes sense in my book, because the whole beauty of cryptocurrency is that you don't have to trust anyone. So if they're developing a solution that requires trust in an outside entity, it sounds like we're trying to make our own centralized banks.
What is scary to me is that centralised transactions always means that somebody stands to make a lot of money and therefore can't be trusted to act in the best interests of the users.

@_date: 2018-07-13 20:03:35
I understand what you're saying, but I don't think it's as simple as "spend all the money 3x". There's disparity between who owes the money and who has the money so there's no 1:1 debt/money relationship. That's what I'm trying to get across. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:59:03


No, I'm saying the opposite.


Sure, if you assume that everyone is somehow solvent and can pay in a roundabout fashion where peter pays paul pays sam pays jill etc ect. That's leagues different than "just paying it off" which is impossible. Again, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm saying people have this perception that the world is in catastrophic credit card debt and we can't possibly pay it off. I'm saying, it doesn't matter because it doesn't work like that and the people controlling the world's money have more incentive to play ball with each other, occasionally at the common people's expense.
I'm not too sure where I land on bitcoin taking over for the current banking system. I also don't think it would be much different than what we currently have. I also don't think that bitcoin alone is capable of ever getting to that point. Unpopular opinion on this sub, I know, but it's the prevailing opinion in the crypto market as a whole.

All condescension aside, yes, of course that's how it works.
My point was that at this point we already have more debt than money and that's how it's meant to work. People think of debt like high interest credit card debt they used to go on a shopping spree. While that is indeed bad debt, it doesn't mean that all debt is bad, or even unuseful.

Monero and ETH are promising, but don't have the actual volume to really test their implementations.
 Decentralised sounds like a specific thing, but that's a misconception. If it's the idea that anyone can run a full node then really nothing has that, not even bitcoin, less so if lightning becomes a reality and we're relying on trusted 3rd parties to process the lightning transactions (like we do with fiat). 
 If we're talking about the classic idea of a full node that processes transactions, which is what the contemporary miners are doing, then I'd say you have to go with a proof of stake coin, or something that will transition to proof of stake after a certain number of blocks. Peercoin comes to mind, but that's vaporware at this point.

A plan that will likely hardfork the network and drop significant value from the coin, and might not even solve anything because the people who want to fix btc have the minority share of the hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:03:27
It will lose value if it's no longer the longest chain. Even if the exchanges go for Core's implementation, which is looks like they mostly will, it opens the segwit/core bitcoin network up to a 51% attack.
Price speculation doesn't like additional risk, so, if there's a minority run hard fork it is at least some additional risk, which is bad for price.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:43:00
I'm about 20/80 btc/eth right now. It varies because most exchanges allow you to trade once against the other. There has been times in the last month when I'm 100% ETH and 100% BTC, and honestly the ETH looks to be a safer bet at this point.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:10:25

@_date: 2016-05-05 21:41:27
Yes, it's easy to call it personal responsibility before you're emotionally involved and logically compromised. Fact is, it doesn't matter how upset you are, if you screw up and loose all of your assets it's your fault because you screwed up. This is the same thing as if a bank screws up and loses all of your money. Sure it's covered by insurance, but there aren't many cases of that insurance actually helping anyone when shit *really* hits the fan because shit hasn't really hit the fan in recent memory. If we saw another great depression (and a run on the banks) you can bet that that insurance isn't going to worth much.
The idea that mistakes are inevitable is a weak argument. The overwhelming majority of bitcoin holdings are safe in the hands of their various users. The fact that some wind up compromised does not imply that all are prone to compromise is also factual.

My local coffee bar started accepting BTC around a year ago. They stopped accepting BTC 6 months after that, because they were getting a better fee structure from VISA/AMEX and didn't see the novelty in accepting it anymore when it was costing them money.

It's been decoupling for about a month now. When BTC would go up, ETH would follow, but when BTC would fall any substantial amount ETH would be up in response.
It looks to me like people are trading BTC for ETH to retain value while BTC falls, then rebuying BTC while it's on the way back up.

Good to see we're mostly on the same page here. 
It's never happened. FDIC was created as a result of the banks not being insured in the 20s and people losing everything as a result. The thing is, if the 20's happened again, the FDIC would end up diluting the currency and returning a fraction of the real value owed. $100,000 is an easy payout if that's how much a loaf of bread costs. Lookup post-ww1 germany, this stuff is possible. This is unlikely as it sits now, but not impossible.
The beauty of bitcoin is *you* are the bank. If you make a mistake, it's on you. As-is, a bank can make a mistake and it's still on you even though you have no control over it. I'd rather control my destiny here because I have my best interests at heart, my bank does not.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:41:03
Significant digits forcing value stability and there's a very fixed number of coins (not many). Most of the alts have far more coins in circulation, so an individual unit of those coins can't be worth as much without having a proportional market cap.
I'll be the first to say that if BTC doesn't have consensus that solves the volume problem soon, it's going to be overtaken by an alt coin, at which point, BTC becomes the alt. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:09:27


Yes. Don't use bitcoin.

What do you mean by wallet tech? As in, trusting a 3rd party with my coins? Doesn't sound like a wallet because it's not. It's a bank.
One of the foundations of bitcoin is that I don't have to trust anyone, ever. Coming from someone who's had their bank accounts fraudulently levied, that's really fucking attractive and worth protecting. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:21:05
Low, very low. Bitcoin's price is live, unregulated, speculation. Uncertainty means sell. Always. No exceptions.
You'd be safer to not keep your fiat on-exchange either, because if the exchange goes insolvent your money is as good as gone.

The segwit supporters. Personally, I'm not sure why the Core Developers didn't just add in the stuff that BU (bitcoin unlimited) wanted. It isn't like the ideas are incompatible.
The conflict theory loving side of me thinks that there's some other power at play here, and segwit gives someone an advantage that would be lost with larger blocks.

New blocks moving isn't really a problem. You probably moved more than 2mb when you loaded this webpage. The problem is downloading the 100gb blockchain to get started moving the tiny subsequent blocks. 
That said, while I'm running a full node now (spinning rust is cheap) I do wonder how secure not having a full copy of the blockchain is. It seems like there are plenty of people saying "not secure" and "omg double spending" but not much elaboration on that point.

Plausable, but my understanding is that your node is validating the whole chain while it syncs so it knows 100% that the transactions are legit. 
I'm guessing that you could use a pre-purged blockchain and just move that to a node and it would be happy to run without downloading it. I haven't tried it though.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:49:41
Sure, and it would behove us to remember the role the miners play, being that if no one is guessing hashes we can't transact. It seems the miners have most of the power here, not the nodes, and certainly not the wallets.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:32:35
The guy who posted the comment above you is being intentionally misleading. Segwit is one of the proposed methods to scale bitcoin.
The easiest way is to just make the blocks larger. The 2mb blocksize was set in 2007, but computers and internet speeds have scaled exponentially since then, as have the number of transactions on the bitcoin network. A popular number is 8mb, which would easily handle the current transaction volume and then some. At minimum it would buy us time to find a scaling method less contentious than segwit.
