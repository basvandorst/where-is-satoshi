tl;dr, tulips.

the answer is 42?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:58:55
tulips... take a shot yall
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:59:19
yeah, but were you correct about this too?  
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:08:38
too bad, i need someone with outsider info

i predict tai lopez will post another bitcoin academy youtube video. what's that, like trump university?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:01:38
ugh, tulips again. i swear tulips have become the new godwin law. as soon as i see tulips i know logic departed somewhere up the road, replaced with fud.

sure wish hal was still alive to see what's happening

i'm no acct/lawyer but if you hold an asset (and btc is viewed as an asset by gov) you pay no tax until/unless it is converted to $. for example if you have gold and you move it from one storage to another, no tax is due. think there are exceptions to this rule though.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:45:18
only if cra calls you from bangalore asking for moneygram payment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:11:28
there's talk of potential geo-political upheaval. fear of nuclear war with dprk with s. koreans gobbling up btc as flight to safety, however justified. 
then trump's declaration of jerusalem being israel's capital throwing the middle east in a tizzy. 
i think trump has actually been a positive force for btc. with his erratic ways, people are trying to hedge against instability and uncertainty and btc offers them a way in. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:35:17
yes that, and the fact that if one is way into the payment term, the interest portion has diminished significantly so the payments are mostly principal at that point and even the bit of interest is still tax deductible (in usa at least, for now) and so why give free early money to the bank?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:39:48
easy to scoff at with the advantage of hindsight. btc has had a higher chance of depreciating than rising. the slightest news rattles the owners. sure the tulip refrain has been used ad nauseum but the writer wasn't wrong based on the facts that were available to him at the time. it indeed has been a gamble for many and the jury is still out on this experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:23:58
one way is to pull some or all of your original investment and leave the rest in. although at your level might as well leave it in. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:28:26
thanks, found the metaphors very informative. excellent presentation.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:54:57
ok, if this bubble lasts a few decades, it'll be a cool bubble. let it pop after i die.

even if, gdax is my arbitrarily chosen quoting platform. it has pretty charts :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:36:46
i like cramer but on his mad money show he goes out of his way not to mention cryptos, like some sort of blood pact. of course he plugs nvda all the time which is flying high thanks to guess what.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:20:11
and it ain't 20 until gdax says so

if i had a bitcoin for every time someone asked this question, i wouldn't have to answer this question. but since i  didn't, the answer is, no, it's never too late.

@_date: 2017-12-15 01:55:32
too idealistic for this commercial capitalistic world of ours. i am also sad about the current situation where tai lopez is pushing some shady bitcoin academy. but unlike you i liked it fine when bitcoin was in the dark. sure the publicity has rocketed it into space and it may still go higher but now it's like a cheap whore in a seedy part of town being passed around from pimp to pimp and john to john. no choice but to just roll with it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:53:21
imo, fomo is not a good sentiment to yield to. you are already a player who can afford to lose it all. so leave it at that. this sort of unbridled frenzy never has a good ending. the problem is no one can predict the time of reckoning. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:51:25
and jeff bezos owns nearly 20% of amazon. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:08
everyone's entitled to their opinion and those opinions are always biased. if they stand to gain on bitcoin's rise they defend it and if they don't, they bash it. neither side really has compelling evidence to show which direction bitcoin will head. 
bashers are right though, bitcoin will eventually implode, either by panic sale next week, or newer investments in the years ahead, or some cataclysm in the centuries ahead or the sun going supernova in a couple of billion years. bitcoin's ultimately doomed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:05
and hence the dilemma and the nightmare of owning it. do you sell and regret later? do you hodl and regret later? good luck mate and congrats.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:09:16
perhaps you are unveiling a no-cost cure for all cancers or have given away all your belongings to the poor and in that case you are deserving of pride and admiration. otherwise if you drive a car, if you have children, if you heat or cool your multi-room house, if you buy more than what's absolutely necessary to survive, if you pay taxes to a country that has a military complex and nukes, you are not helping the world much.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:41

brilliant. the modest detractors would profess that they avoid cryptos because of their own conclusions based on whatever. fair enough. dimon smugly cried out his contempt for cryptos and the people involved. ok big man, here's your chance to prove it. let's see if you have a backbone.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:58
if he can prove it by showing a large locked and loaded short position, then i may believe his sincerity. otherwise talk is cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:24:54
actually don't believe brk was ever $10/share but might have been close to that when buffett arrived in the mid-1960's. anyways the trick is holding the right investment and unfortunately in just about all cases only time will tell if holding was the right decision. luck plays a huge factor.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:05:33
dude, it's because of people like you that btc is where it is today. if no one sold, only a handful of people would bounce them back and forth between each other. and no, it wasn't going to be legit currency anytime soon. often times things deviate from their original intended purpose. so thanks
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:16:01
my first thought too. somehow hoping the op is a woman. and i'm not very fond of wives or ex-wives in general.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:04:26
day trading sucks. years ago i did it with stocks because i was oh so smart. lost a pile of money and the stress probably shortened my life. learned my lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:55:46
it's risen enough already for now. let it chill for a good while. what's the hurry?

you know the thing about paying off the mortgage is? by the time you can pay it off, the monthly payment doesn't seem like a big deal anymore. how do i know? for years i dreamt of paying mine off. now for the past 2 years i could have comfortably done it and yet i keep procrastinating. weird how perspective works. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:49:13
the bitcoin ark is nearly complete. o believers, climb aboard. the truth shall be revealed in 40 days and 40 nights.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:46
imo, at this point best to wait for a dip. set a buy price in your mind and stick with it. if it hits then good and if it doesn't then still good. you will have stood by your decision. trying to time anything is a losing proposition. for btc in its current frenzied state it's specially true.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:44:54
wish that were the case but alas the democracy we live in, even the western type, is mostly a mirage. the majority have swallowed the blue pill and follow along. the red pillers follow too because they don't have a choice.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:26:26
a bit harsh there, calm your titties. the spirit of the response is correct, the delivery is savage. 
also, i don't use coinbase but i give them credit for bringing more people into the fold. the average user doesn't know much about addresses and wallets and pub/priv keys. they just want to own btc and exchanges let them do that, albeit in a quasi way.
the fed is the fed, once they smell money they want their cut. i don't care if you meet in sbux or pay someone in japan over tor. if there's a large enough transaction, they'll eventually sniff it out as they did with silk road.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:54
in other words you have invented a time machine. say hi to bill and ted for us.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:42
yes it has crashed and currently at $0. start loading up while it lasts.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:11:35
to be a bit more specific the $ rose against the € today thus helping to push btc over 10k. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:42:01
so far i see 0 btc in there. you, er, i mean your friend is well on his way.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:00:44
not until gdax says so

this is one the many forks (pardon the pun) in the road where men and boys must part ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:46:45
obviously impossible to verify your story but i believe most of the early adopters are hdlrs. sure there's a bit of greed but it's passion that mostly sets the pace. many are techies and already make enough money to enjoy the good life. they don't dream of retiring on some island, they're already living their dreams. the action we see in the market is mostly daytraders, johnny come latelies, and quick hitters. it's fine that they're there too, it injects excitement into the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:10:16
if you consider bitcoin a stock and coins as shares, they can split already. each coin can split up to 100,000,000 pieces called satoshis.

if the poster had a $5k gambling budget, why would btc be a bad time as opposed to a casino or a bookie?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:48:16
bitcoin has been getting decent coverage for more than a few days and if you were mining with your friends you'd be hearing from them a long time ago. this story seems a bit off. but stranger things have happened, so if true, then congrats.

no US stock is $1m. the closest is brk.a headed by warren buffett and it's approaching $300k/share.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:53:21
don't think bitcoin will ever become currency, at least not a widely accepted one. governments just won't allow it fearing the loss of control over population. but it can become a collectible as the first virtual commodity governed by blockchain and hence appreciate in value.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:24:31
sounds like you have inside info on an imminent catastrophic crash. are you advising us to short bitcoin? will it be at $0 next week, next month, when?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:05:39
"Most G7 central banks will likely use external fund managers to invest in cryptocurrencies over this new epoch. But don’t expect this information to be freely available."
that exactly. in fact i think banks have already been quietly buying up cryptos while at the same time bashing it to fortify their positions at cheaper prices. 
but let's assume crypto will crash and burn. what's a mere $100m or $200m to a big bank? near nothing. it'll be written off as a small loss and they continue moving forward. there's too much upside potential and little downside for them.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:21:06
put in what you can lose. if your heart is pounding during the purchase, you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:10:13
congrats to you. the fact is that sellers are just as important as buyers and hodlers. keeps the market liquid and adds breadth. but why the rapid exit? if one can buy over time one can sell over time too.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:56:04
a few years back i bought a few from bitinstant as a joke. still have them and have no idea how to sell them nor do i care to. i live frugally so it can go to a million or 0 and my life will be pretty much the same. guess i'm a hodler by ignorance and dullness. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:21:13
iran is too much talk and little action. i'm sure the gov there is accumulating btc but doubt it'll be the official anything, specially since the origin is unknown and they are highly paranoid of external influence. a few years back they wanted to make euro the official trading currency as a spite to usa. so much for that. wouldn't put too much weight on what they say.

actually s/he is implying 9900%+ appreciation. and unfortunately the answer to your question is unknown. buy as much as you can comfortably lose and hodl on.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:57:47
the naysayers were right about amazon. the stock went from $110 to $5. but then we know where it closed last friday and a certain person is now the richest man in the world with $100b. wonder if he owns any bitcoins.

got a bunch of people in the same boat here. not much of a consolation but we just keep hammering here and maybe someone there will push the button. checked your order status on bitinstant? that may tell you if they have the money and are stuck on the buy side.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:50:20
it's 50/50. sometimes it works. other times you wait and wait and wonder if your money is gone. zipzap seems ok, it's bitinstant's poor platform and lousy customer support. only send what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:16:57
come on bitinstant. i put in an order last sun and it went nice and smooth. today, it just says loading. what's up?
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:21:13
waiting since yesterday. got an email from their cs named seth that i should wait 24 hrs. somehow have a feeling i won't be seeing squat. you checked the order status page? mine's stuck at 'loading'. whatever that means. if it magically go thru, i'll post.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:44:53
then give the zipzap conf# here and hope for the best. bitinstant peeps seem to troll this sub and give occasional responses. although i'd like to believe they're busy fixing their system right now.
