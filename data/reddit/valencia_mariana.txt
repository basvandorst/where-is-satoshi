I lot of people think like you and it is certainly easier to buy bitcoin when the price is generally rising but not everyone is investing for that reason. I bought a bitcoin at around 600 usd to a, be a part of it and b, I understood the technology and I personally believed it was a revolution. Prior the the value rising I had 'lost' money twice.

There has been a lot of trolling, obvious trolling, as well as misinformation and the like. Don't take it personally.
It's your choice to switch. Just remember, the bch network has no stress on it at all, just like all the other alternative coins. As you say, bitcoin was fine when no one was using it. Additionally, they not compatible with lightning network so they have no where to go once they hit problems. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:28:24
Can you see the transaction on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:51:54
The current difficulty of the BTC chain is set so that ~11 exahashes will mine a block every 10 minutes. With the spike in BCH price, however, 6 exahashes has moves from BTC to BCH. So, we currently have only ~3.75 exahashes mining BTC so it's taking a lot longer.
On the otherhand, BCH's difficulty is set so that around 0.5 exahashes mine a block every 10 minutes, but they currently have 6.75 exahashes mining their blocks, so they are pumping out 40-45 blocks an hour, less than 2 minutes a block.
BCH will have a difficulty adjustment very soon, so that blocks are only mined every 10 minutes again. At that point, a lot of the mining power should come back to BTC.

1 block left :o
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:15:04
The higher fees and transaction back log are a direct result of mining power going over to BCH (less hasing power means blocks are mined slower until the difficulty adjusts, slower blocks means less transactions processed/validated and thus the fee goes up to get your transaction processed faster. So BCH has damaged the reputation of Bitcoin. The value of BCH+BTC is less than what BTC was a week ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:33:14
It foes up and down but only every 2016 blocks. Which is around every 2 weeks if blocks are being mined every 10 minutes. 
Currently BCH has a very low difficulty but has 60% of BTCs hash power mining it, so it is smashing through blocks every 1-2 minutes. Their due a a difficulty adjustment in 25 blocks time, which at the current rate will happen in ~35 minutes.

Everytime bitcoin defends attacks (I'm not commenting on the if the attacks are malicious or not here, that doesn't matter) it reinforces trust in the system. The first dip I experienced was very scary. Recently bitcoin dropped back down from 3.8k gbp to 2k gbp and I didn't care because bitcoin had proven itself to be resilient. The 'attack' this weekend did scare me, I'll be honest. Particularly as I sold all my free bch coins. I knew I wouldn't sell the btc but I was worried. Now bitcoin has survived, I won't be worried next time.

Again, I don't want to get into if it's malicious or not. BCH stole hash power from the network in such a way that the difficulty adjustment was not designed to handle. This may not have been there intention, although there is a post somewhere saying that it was, but it did it none the less. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:20:55
They released 20 million earlier and the price went down... 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:08:34
Get a grip, transaction are dirt cheap right now. I'm not saying we should only discuss the price, but all the fees are sky high nonsense is getting boring. It's a narrative that is being push with fanatical beats of the drum. If you need a debate, make a debate. There's lots of technical discussion worth having. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:41:37
4 hours? the rate they are going through blocks it will be about 20 minutes, no?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:23:49
I'm not committing on their intentions. My reply was not emotional, it was logical. The loss of hash power to bch caused a slowdown of the bitcoin network which pushed up fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:20:26

You are simply swapping unconfirmed transactions. Not using a different chain,as secure as bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:19:32
If the hashing power suddenly disappears it increases transaction time, as blocks are mined slower than every 10 minutes. The worst point in the last few days there were 2 blocks being mined an hour, instead of 6.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:13:37
49% of us didn't
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:45:12
Nah, we are currently mining 2 blocks an hour while BCH are mining 42 blocks an hour. The difficulty adjustment time delay (every 2000ish blocks) is allowing miners to see-saw like mofo's.

I don't see the relevance really of the terminology if they are the same. When the 'right' use the term leftist Marxist they mean: person/group that is left of centre, advocates for redistribution of wealth/public ownership of wealth and views social interactions in terms of group identity. That is a socialist. To say, well they don't call themselves Marxist so you're an idiot... 
However, if this is just some basic argument about if they even exist then fine, see the list below. This argument is degenerated to the point of boring now. Let's leave it here, take it easy.

I don't think I can prove anything to you because I no longer believe  you are talking to me in good faith. You have your view and I am your enemy; you cannot learn anything from me. If I am honest, I think you may be ideologically possessed. 
Leftist Marxist and alt-right are both bogey man terms each side uses to describe the other. 
The point I am making is that high ranking members of society openly declare themselves as socialist whilst the 'alt-right' is the fringes of society and a out cast minority. It is completely forbidden in polite conversation. And God help any member of government that declared they were alt-right or any associated term.

I agree, we don't need some many threads.
The 'shit hole of political arguments' should really be ignored to be honest. The people arguing about politics do not belong here, they are not being true to the core of bitcoin.
Bitcoin, after all, is a politically neutral currency (among other things) so why people are arguing about politics within is beyond me and is, frankly, embarrassing and ignorant.
Regarding why Peterson deserves some attention. He has a big reach which includes a lot of people outside the sphere of bitcoin. So him telling his audience that crypto currency is needed is a fairly big deal. I don't think he has mentioned bitcoin by name, as you highlighted, but its pretty synonymous with crypto currency for the average Joe/Jane bloggs.

I'm not really too interested in most of these points. I'm not of the camp of 'I must defend every single thing he says'. 
There are some things he has said that I'm just like 'Okay...' with a mystified look on my face. Such as when he said the medical symbol (the two snakes) represent the helix of DNA and people somehow knew this hundreds of years ago (I'm simplifying here, of course). To me that's just bullshit. 
People tend to fall into the camp of "I must validate/invalidate everything he says because he is on my team/not on my team". To me this is primitive tribalism. I see value in some things he talks about and they've helped me improve as a person. I'm not going to die on a hill defending/attacking him though.

Such a scything reply.
Here's something I remember from a while back:

I see your site but it looks pretty low budget to me.

The term is irrelevant really although 'Marxist leftist' has some utility in describing a fairly large group of people based on their view.
The same could be said for alt-right. No one actually calls themselves alt-right, except maybe an extremely small minority of people, but the term gets branded around by the left to group together people they don't agree with. People use it without any understanding because they see it in a media article. 
I guess these terms make conversations easier.
I think the point he makes stands though. People want to censor other people because of their views. It's pretty fascist, which I suppose is humours when you consider some of these groups identify using names like antifa (anti-fascism).

I'm not too interested in the C-16 stuff, personally. I do know that he never said the law itself criminalised incorrect use of pronouns. He stated that you could get fined and if you did not pay the fine you could go to jail. So it was indirectly criminalised. Also he highlighted a lot of the nasty stuff was not in the bill itself but the policies it referenced from the Ontario Human Rights court. My knowledge here is not great though so take it with a pinch of salt. Again, I'm not too concerned about C-16 especially as I am not Canadian. I do see value in some of the stuff he talks about though. I'm actually quite interested in his lectures on biblical stories. Those are quite long though.
I'm not interested in if he is a saint or a demon. He is a human with virtues and flaws like any other.

If I Google Marxist I get 47 million results. (this was a weak argument from you to be honest)
But really, there are lots of people and groups who's core ideas are built upon Marxism. They may call themselves socialist or something else but the ideas are very much alive. 
I don't really see any mainstream alt-right movement, not in any position of power anyway.

Send your bitcoin to that address
*Do not lose the printed address or your bitcoin are lost forever with no recovery*

I have watched those conversations. I wouldn't go so far as to say it would be a detriment to science. I'm not saying your wrong but my understanding here is there is a clear distinction drawn between what science offers us and what religion offers. One deals with facts and the other morality and there need not be a contradiction. 
Science teaches us a lot but it does not help us comprehend our own mortality and the potential nihilism it brings. It also doesn't teach us anything of morality. Religion has something to offer there. It is more than the naive worship of a deity. The deity isn't really the important part.
