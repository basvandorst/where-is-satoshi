Not really, what makes bitcoin different from say gold in terms of using it to purchase items.
You go into a store and have to buy your items according to the price of a currency, not according to the price of bitcoin. You convert the value of bitcoin to USD then make the purchase.

You take this as a joke? My arguments are valid.

So why are we referring to is as a currency?

It doesn't explain how usd are a value system and that bitcoin pegs itself to this value system instead of creating its own

I think the idea I'm trying to get at is that the USD provides a standard or constant in which we value things, I would call this a currency.
If I go to the store and buy a laptop, I can judge how much I think it's worth in terms of dollars, I can't for example determine how much I think it's worth in something like muffins. That's because it doesn't really have it's own value system like the USD has, it's only valued within that system, which is judged by the dollar.
This would make the muffin a commodity, not the currency. I feel bitcoin falls into this commodity category since I can't accurately judge what something is worth in bitcoins
without refrencing the USD first. All business that accept bitcoin do the same. If Dell sells a laptop at $500 USD, and accepts btc, it will sell it in btc for however much $500 of BTC is.
It doesn't determine the worth of the laptop in btc only. If you look at gold, are you able to judge how many bitcoins that piece of gold should be worth, by only looking at bitcoins alone?
I don't think I could, nor most businesses. However, most would be able to comfortably judge it's worth to them in USD. How it is now is that if you buy something with btc, you are trading btcs for whatever good or service judged in value by USD, this is the essential difference between USD and btc. And if this is true, can BTC survive as merely a trading commodity without a value system?
