In your system, people cannot be trusted. Yet business, trade and almost every external interaction requires trust. Even Bitcoiners trust that the software they're using doesn't have any malware. Bitcoin cannot replace fiat due to it's deflationary nature and our current state of economics. We are in a credit based system. So the governments and individuals with bad credibility, like Venezuela, fail.

Why not just use dollars

Sends $200k. Ends up with $180k

Or going into debt to create a business or improve a business. How does one make bitcoin loans when it’s capped globally? Turkish Lira could crash but the dollar isn’t due to the situations it’s in. Fiat is political money that won’t go away

No one in Venezuela uses cash because carrying that insane amount of bills will get your life in danger. Most transactions are done with credit cards. Don’t take a country with some of the most political instability as a sample for why bitcoin will win. Your assumption is that all governments will end up like the Venezuelan governments and that’s just plain faulty logic.

You will get many answers to this question. I believe it was for online commerce. To eliminate PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, etc. Payment processors make money off transactions. If there was a fiat-BTC fixed establishment it should be used for online commerce. 
Full blown libertarians and bitcoin maximalists believe that it will replace banks/government based fiat currency. 
Read the Bitcoin Whitepaper. It’s fairly easy to understand and you can draw your own conclusions if you haven’t already.
