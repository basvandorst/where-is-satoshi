Ooh ooh are we doing narratives? Here's mine!
The price took a tumble when the IRS reminded people that they want to tax it (and set out guidelines), but now that people have sent in their taxes they are forgetting about that and being less annoyed and pessimistic.

That finding is not founded. The authors of the paper had only been collecting data for a year; if thefts had happened before then, they would not have evidence of it. Even the statistics on attack volume and success rate are unusable, since they are again based only on the past year.
It's good work, but the claim is overstated.

How is this any different from a regular user submitting a new version of the transaction with a higher fee? Regular miners may already prefer the newer transaction when assembling a block.

That page is hella confusing. When I click on an item, all the colors change, but the numbers and graphs take a second to update. (Laggy internet right now.) The result is that I can't tell if the selected item, uh, correlates with the data displayed.

There's a downside to large numbers as well, though -- it makes BTC look like the Zimbabwean dollar. (Equally unrelated to actual value, but still relevant psychology.)

My concern was that the private key might be known to people other than myself. (I doubt it, but hey.) I basically just wanted to spend all the money residing on that key so as to make it useless to any other party.
I don't actually care about the the linkability, at least at the levels generated by normal spending activity. I just didn't want to link *everything* all at once.

Oh, you make a good point! Just because I've imported it into one wallet doesn't mean I can't import it into a different one. I could just fire up a different client on this computer, copy the key over there, and send all of it (minus txn fee) to my main wallet.

Coin is not going to be safe on the average user's desktop. (Malware.) It should be in an inexpensive hardware wallet that communicates over USB and allows the user to release coins as needed.

It is absolutely fine to put a Bitcoin address in public view! The only consideration is one of privacy, not security -- money that you receive on that address will be linkable to whatever page you put the address on, theoretically (say, with a search engine.)
The simplest thing to do is run the Bitcoin client on your computer and have it generate addresses for you to use. If you're good at keeping out malware, this is probably the safest approach as well.

Some options I can see:
* Trade out your bitcoins for USD (or whatever) using a market site. They don't have an incentive to trace you. (Of course, if you were after anonymity for political/criminal reasons, this would be a bad idea!)
* Use an anonymizer/remixer site. Kind of an annoying process.
* Donate the money anonymously to a cause that accepts Bitcoin and that you would have donated to anyway.

How about this: Use a picture of a dollar bill (green and white rectangle with oval or face in the center) for the "sell BTC" icon, and a BTC coin for the "buy BTC" image. That way, all I have to do is look at the map and see what people are offering. ("I see paper money there. I want paper money! I will click there.")
@_date: 2012-08-22 00:40:43
One thing that I find confusing about the map is that I can't tell who is selling and who is buying. Maybe you can make better icons (sorry, I have no constructive design advice), but a legend/key would be a big first step.

You can either price in USD or BTC, and it would be fair to change prices as the market changes. For instance, I would have to be [out of my mind]( to buy BTC right now instead of using what's already in my wallet, and similarly I wouldn't set prices based on the current exchange rate.

A nice investment strategy is (I think it's called) dollar cost averaging. Put in $20 each month, no matter what the price is, for the next 3 years. That way you buy at the average price over that time span.
On the other hand, this is *probably* a bubble. I would set a buy order at $180, since I believe there will be a "correction" that temporarily plunges as low as $140. Ideally you'd set up a ladder of buys according to how probably you think each point is on the next big drop, and how profitable it would be.
