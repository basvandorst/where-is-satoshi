Ya but they aren't satoshi, szabo, dai, or nash
Get an adult to help you read 'ideal money', slowly, sentence by sentence.

If i said "i am nash sato koto" you wouldn't have understood.
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:35:06
i feel like you sealed it right here.

I don't care about the price either, since its obvious the value is in the function, and the adoption of it.  However when academics and the news are forced to break this story...this world is going to change at a viral pace.
I just don't think people understand what this means...

I don't really know about the whole letters and words of the psedo names.  That is not at all how I came to the realization, I came to it randomly because my job required me to study nash's works.  I knew very little about bitcoin, but i was studying the bargaining problem, which is a paper about the value of introducing money into a bargaining situation that previously did not have money to help.
Bitcoin is the bargaining problem version 2.0, it is what happens when you add a universal hypercurrency.  Look at pg 8 
figure 2 is no money, figure 3 is trade with money, and figure 4 would be trade with bitcoin!
Sajo is both a river in the BAZ AND it is the last name of a very well known advocate for an international constitutional law.  This is what szabo has created and forseen in all his writings!
Each psedonom has the property that it cannot be change.  How does sajo both reflect the BAZ AND andres sajo who is a known proponent and judge in regards to International constituational law, know that the left over letters spell ICL
I'm glad you point the difference in the two lecture/writings, there are about 10+ versions of ideal money on nash's public school site, and when you read them all you have a better understand of the whole picture...you see if you try to understand in its parts then you will miss the point! such is the genius!
Take the welfare economics paragraph: 
"A related topic, which we can’t fully consider in a single lecture, is that of the considerations
to be given by society and the national state to “social equity” and the general
“economic welfare”. Here the key viewpoint is methodological, as we see it. HOW should
society andthestate authoritiesseek toimprove economic welfare generally andwhat should
be done at times of abnormal economic diﬃculties or “depression”?"
ideal money is a contentless outline for szabo's homepage and deep interlinked works.

"I am speaking about a research project that is not fully complete since I have not yet written up and submitted for publication any paper or papers describing the work. Also the details of what axioms to use and how to select the basic set theory underlying the hierarchical extension to be constructed are not fully crystallized. I have also a great fear of possible error in studying topics in this area. It is not rare, historically, for systems to be proposed that are either inconsistent or that have unexpected weaknesses. So I feel that I must be cautious and proceed without rushing to a goal. And this psychology of fear has also inhibited me from consulting other persons expert in logic before I could feel that I had gotten my own ideas into good shape."

after about three months of blitzing every social media site, every news station, every bitcoin enthusiast, every major academic...other than my friends that trust my...you are the absolute 1st to agree with the conclusion.
He won't give it up, he set this up so the world would be forced to say his name, and come to the revelation that his 'crazy' rants, about him being our savior and the governments are conspiring against the people...where actually truth.
You might then be interested in the john nash facts (not much about being szabo and wei)

read this and think about bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:27:07
no im some different users maybe (not a regular) but they read my posts and believe them, so started makin their own too!

"nash ideal money: 
Nowadays however few would propose a return to the actual use of simply the metal gold as a standard, for the following reason i. the cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. .....the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor ii. the location of potential gold-mining locations may not be "politically appealing," so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas iii There is some negative psychology about gold....
But, a modern alternative is possible, one that would provide a good standard independent of state pardoners. This idea occurred to me fairly recently."
Szabo creates 'bitgold' 
Nash sees "...there is some negative psychology about gold"
Satoshi changes the name to bitCOIN? And doesn't quote szabo but wei

there are no real down votes, truth is truth
@_date: 2014-06-09 01:16:31
its from 2008
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:18:34
no i just realized that it's something only the poker players could understand, they had a similar thing happen with full tilt
Actually yes by societies standards im crazy but so is nash
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:00:26
Ya 4 down votes...exactly....who is it that down votes truth?
You can't win on here, everyone goes nuts with ridiculous guesses, as if edison could be satoshi:
Edison: Responding to Ford’s plan, Edison searched for new ways to stabilize the dollar, the value of which had fluctuated widely during World War I and its aftermath. His goal was to “cast the variable out of money.” Distrusting bankers -- the “money brokers,” he called them -- and a monetary policy based solely on gold, Edison called for a system that used a variety of other commodities as backing for the nation’s paper money supply. (He would have eliminated gold entirely, but he knew that switch- over costs and international economic ties required retaining it, at least temporarily.) 
Nash: Ideal Money is a theoretical notion promogulated by John Nash, to stabilize international currencies. It is a solution to the Triffin dilemma.
"He proposed that international exchange rates be fixed by pegging the value of each currency to a standardized basket of commodities, called the industrial consumption price index. Such a policy would curtail the ability of central banks to make monetary policy."
Szabo: We may be seeing only the first stages of a switch from floating currencies, which may be proving to be unworkable, to commodity-backed currencies.

do you realize how connected the price of bitcoin is with the realization that john forbes nash has (as szabo) re written every facet of academics and the way society will function?
when this goes viral, we win.
Are you being sarcastic...because if you are not..then you are number 3.
3 people in 3 months, this is our formula for the breakthough of bitcoin
3 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000......
only our own ignorance stands in the wai.
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:56:26
Both Szabo and nash constantly refer to and cite the wealth of nations.  The collective works of these peoples is both a redefintion of economic principles we missed, AND principles of present and today economics
Nash's work is a continuation of adam smiths works.  Ask yourself "WHY have i seen this movie about a random mathematician that went "crazy" 
If you ask anyone they will say this scene does NOT describe a nash equillibrium 
He says "Adam smith was wrong!"
I believe it is a red herring (correct phrase?)....Nash never thought adam smith was wrong!!!
I believe that he purposefully had this put in the movie to refer to it later in life
". This scene is must viewing even though the scene itself contains flawed economics (explaining why the scene is NOT a Nash equilibrium helps students learn the concept in greater depth)."
If you understand math (maybe better than me), what I a saying is "everyone does whats best for themselves and the group" IS a nash equilibrium solution for todays society.
This won't make sense until we re write academia with szabo/nash's new economic theories and applications.

Yes all this i have noticed and a million more, its all quite apparent once you look into it. here is something from the mtgox news story:
For Mt. Gox customers, the news seemingly went from bad to worse this week when an unknown individual entered the  IRC channel with the stunning claim that a hacker collective deeply penetrated Mt. Gox's network prior to its bankruptcy. The poster writes:
i just relay... i cant good english... they say me there is botnet [attacking?] gox company for some year to get file. they have 20gb document and give me share here. i not hacker... just posting. i just translate some the line in room of talk... [the room] is Russian is russian so copy paste here senseless... apology [but] i cant share original [so its] useless to ask.

Thank you, however people are still burying this realization. Here is more info 
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:16:36
Thanks yes I read that quote to but I had lost where it was from, I have read more than I can keep track of and fully remember.
I realize that I am not the best to present this, that is my role, i simply know the truth, I seemingly do not have the credibility to get it out there.
You will find no matter what avenue you seek, it was nash.  even down to the timezone they figure satoshi lived in...
and the 'bloody hell' which they though was a quote from a british satoshi, but was really just an very old saying from the early/mid 1900s
thx for the tip, the money isn't so important obv, but I appreciate learning about the reddit, and tip system.
I will only pay it forward ;)
I am the opposite of a student, I fled academics faster than nash fled the us.  
Watch the real story instead, then you will understand, keep in mind, nash is a liar!
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:12:00
btw how does redit work.  Everytime there are upvotes it gets matched with down votes.  I can't imagine people judging this are collectively borderline.
Its obviously nash...why do we act so rigged?
