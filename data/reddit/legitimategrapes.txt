I'm not tutoring microeconomics for free just because you won't read the comment you're responding to. Google sunk cost fallacy

China has been accused of artificially deflating the yuan to increase exports. Since that wouldn't be possible with bitcoin, the government probably sees it as a threat to their export industries. That seems consistent with their advocacy of bitcoin but attempts to make it unusable domestically.

These aren't unrealized gains. If you hold 1K in bitcoins today, it doesn't matter what you bought them at. That's a sunk cost fallacy. You're still losing the same amount either way.
Edit: A better description would be to say you aren't recognizing the bygones principle.

He's right. If you hold 1K in bitcoins today, it doesn't matter what you bought them at. That's a sunk cost fallacy. You're still losing the same amount either way.

"Get off your high horse" is hilarious coming from someone who wants to start a conversation with "false" and is wrong. It has everything to do with the sunk cost fallacy. It's why the last person in this thread saying the exact same thing got downvoted to hell until he deleted his comments. Everyone sees this but you (and I guess him).

Any discussion proves to be a circle jerk or two opposing circle jerks. This is just the latter.
