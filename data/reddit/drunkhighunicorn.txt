Thanks. So you use only hardware one yourself?
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:34:36
what wallet do you develop?
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:51:56
yeah it seems that I'm the lucky one. Thanks
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:55:54
ok, thank you!
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:47:40
maybe it'd happen later my friend
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:47:32
Do you use it yourself?
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:30:51
that was one of my tricky thoughts :)
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:33:31
In Soviet Russia only bear market is allowed

I highly recommend choosing a wallet from this list as opposed to lumi-- [
I have never heard anything about lumi wallet. I personally use electrum, its great.  
So did I. Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:03:16
got you, tnanks
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:45:52
ok so I'll tell my boss that I'm gonna use Trezor or something like that instead of mobile app

I don't get steel pipe part
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:55:28
No surprise to see charts like these during cryptowinter
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:00:42
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:02:48
on company's expense of course 
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:46:47
that sounds rational...thanks!
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:06:53
so I assume you haven't lost anything. I'm really happy for you!
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:43:20
I don't use BTC at the moment but might start using due to the fact that I'll be paid in it
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:16:20
oh, ok I see :)
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:55:27
How did it happen?
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:25:19
actually not, it's just my boss with his pro-crypto (and especially btc) attitude  
But your thoughts are helpful thanks
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:40:44
uhm okaaaay...
@_date: 2019-02-04 11:32:57
So many days passed since your comment...And I still don't get it :(
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:23:56
never thought of this, thanks! I'll surely consider this option.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:30:12
he surely is
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:35:23
Which one do you personally prefer as a cold storage and as a hot wallet?
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:40:12
Yeah he is. That's actually how we managed to start this venture I'm working in, bought some BTC back in the day and sold it with high profit later.
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:34:59
got it, thanks
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:44:08
No idea. I don't wanna be the guy who knew too much you know :)
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:42:23
yes, taxes...I'd still have to pay them somehow
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:46:36
ok I think I got it, thanks! I'll suggest this idea in the office 
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:52:57
there was no any article at all before before that comment came up
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:36:20
Thanks a lot for such detailed and constructive comment!
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:42:30
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:57:00
let it be so

I sometimes look back at current state of adoption and delightly wait how fantastic things will be in 5-10 years
