Recurse?  More like chase a rabbit, which of course was my point... Your response doesn't seem to have anything to do with the blog post you replied to.
But okay, let's see what you have.


Who are these people that "**need** that bitcoin mined in order to survive?"  And couldn't they just buy from exchanges?  Or do they really die without miners selling them miner coin?
Bitcoin even without a block reward is elastic... It can always go up in value to provide the value needed for as large a market as might wish to use it.  What it has trouble doing is scaling to the transaction volume, but that is a different bouncy white rodent.  And if people need Bitcoin, they buy them.  In a 6 to 7 billion dollar market, 1 million a day represents less than 0.1 percent of the supply.   


Some conclusions without actual logic.  Stopped clocks are often right, but without any reasoning to discuss, I am not sure what we are supposed to talk about.


I do view the hashing power of Bitcoin as the key to security.  I have always said that the point of Factom is to provide a scalable way to put data on the Bitcoin blockchain with the minimum of cost and infrastructure.  I am not sure what elasticity has to do with this (an incentive is needed to pay mining, but I'm not sure that has anything to do with elasticity).


Wow.  Great motivation there.   Keep up the class act.

Not getting the point.  You have a very small market, tons of alternatives, but some small number of devoted users.  And you are dissing some smaller alternatives with some devoted users.
This market is chaotic, and tons of tech will succeed. And more will fail.  Even Bitcoin isn't a sure thing.  
You can dress it up, but it is way more simple than you paint it.  People do what they want, use the tech that they want, and take the risks they want.

Roughly 1.7x by most estimates, but could be 1.8 if many multisig transactions become popular.  More importantly, this isn't next month but ... *eventually*.  SW requires transactions to use it to free more transaction space, something that will not happen overnight.
"soon after" is a year from now, unless we implement signaling, at which point Peter could do a bit faster deployment of a doubling.  But deploying signalling is also a process that will take time, and building in the infrastructure to signal and tally the signals is complicated. It is unclear if Petter expects to have a doubling before July 2017 or not.

600k really isn't that much.  Bitcion has (in K to highlight magnitude) ~7000000k cap,  Greater than 20000k on exchanges, etc.
Somewhere around 1 Billion in dollars, mostly bills, is used in this sort of services per  day.  That's what, almost 40000 dollars to every dollar in Bitcoin?  And dollars are more fungible, more private, and easier to acquire, easier to launder.  Just a little harder to smuggle across boarders, but plenty of banks are happy to help.
 Bitcion is just a "bit" player here.




Small fry don't have too much trouble obscuring their coins.  Large organizations simply can't (too many patterns pop out of the blockchain).

Actually, most of what 101 tries to tell you about micro economics is irrelevant.  Of course, dismissal without any reasoning is a conversation deadend.

When I said "stalled" I mean Bitcoin has no room for transaction growth, not development.
And when I say the debate did not harm Bitcoin, I am referring to the fact that the Bitcoin Core Developers were disconnected and unconcerned about the broader ecosystem prior to the debate.   It is easy as a developer to simply view your approach as correct without concern for side effects that do not impact directly the developer.
Bitcoin  suffers some from being highly, highly developer centric. (They are not alone in this space; many projects built on blockchain and blockchain like tech do.) 
For example, Bitcoin Core does not have any members that perform management tasks like maintaining communication channels with various shareholders in the ecosystem (payment processors, miners, wallets, merchants, users, etc.).   Bitcoin Core doesn't have any members that focus on documentation. Soft tasks, i.e. not development, were totally and likely mostly still are considered independent and outside Bitcoin Core's responsibility.  I think the feeling is that such tasks are not necessary.  And what was learned is that large shareholders are not necessarily willing to have their concerns, timetables, businesses ignored.  I think Bitcoin learned this, but would not have without the debate.  And I think they are working on making sure at least some of these soft tasks don't get ignored.

Look, lots of words to say that users can't make developers of open source projects do what they want.   And a claim that users cannot "demand" (I'm going to assume this includes "advocate for") features/solutions/priorities.
It's all silly.  Open Source is no different from propriatary software, or frankly any company, in this regard.  Nobody "Must" do anything.  Even developers working for a paycheck can just go get another job.
The Universe argument is a fallacy.  The Universe grants nobody a right to anything in any context at alll, ever.   The Universe grants competition, and that's it.  Pretty much as you ascribe to open source.  Only it isn't limited to open source.  Why do companies provide help desks, refunds, etc?  To compete with other companies that do.  There is no Universe requiring them to grant rights to their users and their market.  Plenty of companies, governments, organizations, projects, etc. abuse and ignore their customers/market/citizens/members and their needs.  Eventually those groups fail.  Could take hundreds of years, but they will lose unless they can compete  on other terms, without the support of their customers/market/citizens/members.
Bitcoin is in competition.  Bitcoin core and the project will service the market and its users, or the market and users will move to projects and developers that do.  Maybe funded by companies that feel their investment should be respected, and have the money to fund an alternative.

Not even sure what your point is.  "Counterparty's mining is performed by bitcoin miners."
The obvious retort would be, "...And Ethereum's mining is performed by Ethereum miners.  So?"
We are left to guess what the point really is, or what it has to do with the blog post.  Usually a good tactic is to line up a response with something said in the blog.  Key words help.... but not this time.

Would make more sense if you were not talking about large companies who have vested tons of money and sweat to build businesses that actually make Bitcoin valuable.  You think Bitcoin would be worth anything without cool wallets? Payment processors?  Conventions?  Meetups?  Hackathons? Investors?  Exchanes?  At the scaling bitcoin conferences, these people (Payment Processors, Miners, wallet companies, and all the rest, i.e. tons of people doing real work) were flying often around the world to have a voice.
I get the whole "demands on reddit" crowd not really being in a position to have a voice.  Not really who I was talking about.   And Bitcoin isn't just a little "open source project on our own dime" thing anymore.   Many of us, myself included, have made significant money working in this space, and Bitcoin core developers are often being paid to do what they do.
Basically the development and the ecosystem has to grow up.  And it is.  And it is painful.  But in my 50+ years I have seen this many times before, from personal computers, digital printing, video gaming, the Internet, social media, and now cryptocurrency.  All these ecosystems were forced to grow up, and Bitcoin will too.

Doubling in 6 to 8 months, and doubling in 15 months, all plus or minus whatever.  It remains to be seen if this will be enough to ensure Bitcoin's dominance.  
LN has great promise, but some rather significant obstacles.  The worst is legality, given that when a party transfers money between two other parties, that triggers all kinds of (expensive) money transmission regulations.
The debate did not harm Bitcoin, but provided some communication between parties in the ecosystem that wasn't happening.  The core devs have done some great work, but frankly Bitcoin at the moment is stalled, and the question is if these changes will be enough to let it move forward.  I attribute most of the support for Ethereum to be the market's way of indicating its worry.
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:01:04




So anything used to store value is unsustainable?  This, and the ability to secure and transfer between parties defines the value of Bitcoin.  So there is value based on demand, and utility based on the tech and the security.
The only thing that makes central banking unsustainable is the inability of people to stay within limits; central banks can't help but inflate the money supply.  Bitcoin uses math to avoid this fault.








Weird.  Why?
* Factom isn't aiming to perform value transfers as it's core value proposition.  
* Bitcoin has real limits on the transfers it can do.
* the federal government makes no guarantees that enable Bitcoin tech;  if they could kill Bitcoin they likely would.

Hence the call for feedback in the UI, maybe some stats.  Whatever.   So you do get some kind of reward.  All that OP asked for.
Why not just ignore the whole thing?  It is something Paul Krugman keeps asking, and yet people quite not ignoring Bitcoin.  And people want to be involved.  And it adds security.  (Going to other servers amounts to trusting what they say to you;  the architecture is designed to minimize the need for that.)

I think "kick the can" is appropriate.  I'd hope for some block increase simply to maintain the same operation parameters.  All the miners (supposedly 90% of the hash power) said we should raise the limit.
Why? Because they see this as the least risk.

OP has a completely valid point when it comes to the falling number of full nodes:  The problem is not necessarily the block size.
Other factors also play into this.  The price of Bitcoin.  The difficulty of installation and maintenance of the node.  The lack of visual feedback.
And no.  A user installing a Bitcoin node is **not** responsible for paying for, or doing the development to fix these problems.  
And yes.  It is **totally** legitimate to make these observations here to be discussed.

OP isn't the only one to comment on the "failure of imagination" regarding full nodes.  Maybe it does sound rude, but if you write software for a living (it is what I have done for 30 years) you get over the fact that you work with a test team.

If I can't get over the idea that people are going to comb over everything I do and discuss every shortcoming of my code, then maybe I need to do something else.

Just found the question...
Factom uses a multi-leader RAFT consensus algorithm to order entries into blocks.  The merkle root of these entries is written to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes to lock these blocks down.
The token provides an incentive for distributed autonomous servers to run the protocol.  However, the token is isolated from the use of the protocol, so the use of the protocol to secure data does not require the token.  
@_date: 2015-12-20 00:56:08
I think you have not thought this through.  I don't think Bitcoin can grow slowly and succeed, and even if it did, there isn't room for even your 25-50% growth, with average blocks being over 600K. 
Not entirely sure why you think Bitcoin can remain decentralized if transactions must be pushed off the blockchain into trusted third parties.  Lightning Networks are not ready.  Sidechains are not ready.
You are very likely correct, that if Bitcoin stalls, quite a bit of money will go elsewhere.  Likely into solutions that displace Bitcoin and that you really don't like.  So what is "conservative" is kinda hard to figure.

Well, I guess I am of the school of talking about actual facts and observations rather than personal attacks and arguments through analogy.
Do VCs look for explosive growth? Go through rounds of investment to bootstrap companies?  Yes.   But I think it is too much to make the claim that this defines all the miners, all the wallet companies, all the payment processors, and nearly everyone else with a business in Bitcoin that at two events largely dedicated to this issue who stood up and asked for a larger blocksize.
You want "singles" and "doubles". Great.  Love that analogy because that allows you to argue without pointing to businesses in the real world looking to leverage Bitcoin.  Who exactly are you talking about?  And where do they stand on this issue?
And actually  no change IS change.   What happens to Bitcoin due to a hard limit had no effect on the ecosystem *until we hit the hard limit*.   Then everything changes.  You convert Bitcoin from a flexible payment network to a discriminating network that can only accommodate a portion of the demand. How do you "do" this?  By doing nothing.  Growth simply runs us into an operational change.
I'm not asking you to prove this statement.  There is no shift of burden of proof to you.  This is just what is happening and what will happen with no change.

Why take it personally?   And for the record, I'm a backend guy too.   I don't do UI (or more accurately, when I do I feel like pulling my hair out).  
If you think the UI and the rest of the full node implementation demonstrates exceptional imagination, and is a thing of beauty that any user can install, run, and show off proudly to their friends, then I guess I understand.   If on the other hand, you feel it could use improvement in some of these areas, why deny that?
While I am not a contributor to Bitcoin Core, I do contribute to open source.   All of Factom is open source, plus DTRules (a rules engine I wrote a few years ago), and other little stuff.  All of this has the same "issues" Bitcoin full nodes have.  They are not that easy to install (though Factom is getting better) and they don't have the best UI (really not much of any).  
We do get knocked about the UI.  Pretty frequently.  Own it, and maybe look to recruit a solution.   That's what we are doing.
BTW:  You were not told you have no imagination.  The actual quote is:


What is "it"?  A laptop with a blank white screen.

Factom is centralized, but the next release will move it towards federated, and the last milestone will push us to decentralized and autonomous, as far as the protocol goes.
The idea with Factom is to move meta protocols off the blockchain.  And to build a platform where different protocols can leverage each other using trustless proofs.
So from a selfish vantage point, we should have every reason to keep the block size small, drive up fees, and force adoption of our protocol.   But I am first and foremost a Bitcoin believer and from that perspective I believe kicking the can down the road so we can argue inside of the same operation parameters is the sanest thing to do for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:00:35
We used Koinify to manage the sale (we didn't handle the transactions directly).  So far, only a third of the token sale has been released, since we have to reach certain development milestones to release the funds from the token sale.
All the purchases of Factoids was done publically.  Go to the [Konify page]( where they detail the multisig wallet used, which you can [see on the blockchain](

Close enough.  I did mean wallet companies, not coinbase.  
Doing nothing I believe to be worse than BIP101.  I don't think BIP101 is horribly bad, but on an interesting side note, most miners in HK didn't like BIP101 much.  But they liked it better than doing nothing.
Interestingly enough, at the DOJ Cryptocurrency Conference (at the San Francisco Federal Reserve no less) it was the guys from the IRS that argued against "tainted" coins and such.  They pointed out that almost all currency tests positive for drugs.  That you can't have a useful system that tries to blacklist money that people may have innocently taken for payment without knowing its history.
Just a fun fact.  That particular conference with many "three letter" participants, was amazingly pro cryptocurrency.  Even as the regulation crowd tried to do their thing.  Heck, it was the FBI that protested more KYC, because the only time they could rely on that was when there wasn't a crime involved.  Otherwise everyone lies.

1) The limit is hard coded by devs today.  This proposal kicks the can down the road, in effect leaving us exactly where we were a year ago, with a hard coded limit that wasn't yet restricting transactions, and with 202, is again not restricting transactions.
Doing nothing is actually how we can meddle and micro-mange the market.  At the scaling Bitcoin Conferences in Montreal and Hong Kong, 100% of people running businesses and running Bitcoin mining operations called for a higher block size limit.
2) His proposal is not additive (whatever that means), linear, nor arithmetic (whatever you mean by that).  It is programmatic and pragmatic.  Take the current limit, double it, and give us time to decide how to proceed without a hard limit making immediate and possibly irreversible changes to the ecosystem.
Criticism of Jeff:  You seem to fail to appreciate the feedback of businesses and miners in favor of the more radical change:  A hard limit imposed by doing nothing.  It is kind of subtle, like hitting someone in the head, to claim the market should choose when there is no way for the market to make devs change the code.
The rest of the conclusions follow the same thread.  A one time "raise the limit" and kick the can down the road solution isn't anything your are saying here.  It demonstrates an acceptence of the political nature of the Bitcoin developers, and there is no lack of understanding here.

Arguments by analogy are useless here.  You are arguing for the dictation of an artificial scarcity imposed by a few on the market.  And you call the set of transaction space a "commons" even though every single transaction contained or excluded represents personal property.
(I have no idea how to relate baseball to Bitcoin, so that one flew right over my head into left field)

If you can give me a list of companies and users that are "okay" and a list of those that we can ignore because they are "bad", then I think your argument that we shouldn't listen to pretty much 100% of the businesses that showed up to the Scaling Bitcoin Conferences would maybe be workable.  (To be fair, some from Blockstream do voice some resistance, but aren't they part of the VC funded, looking for explosive growth crowd we shouldn't listen to?)
You claim the blocksize is completely independent from the Bitcoin price, but at the same time not raising the blocksize is going to hit at "Centralized" businesses.   Really, I'm not sure how you can cull business models from the Bitcoin economy and at the same time claim price concerns are FUD.
Explain some of this stuff.  Give me some objective means of figuring out why we can ignore most of the voices in the Bitcoin economy today asking for us to, *at the very least*, kick this can down the road with something really simple like BIP202.

Despite the hope, lightning networks will only reduce the growth of transactions, not reduce the transaction rate.
No proposal on the table today (with the possible exception of segregated witness) looks to achieve "consensus" (whatever that is supposed to mean).  So fee growth may slow, but it isn't likely to go down, and certainly will go up in the long term.
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:23:25
So in the end... What?  What Bitcoin businesses exist, they (it seems) would like a larger blocksize.  But, for you, they do not qualify if... What, they raised too much money?  You don't agree with their business model?
So we have a proposal here to do that and nothing else.  It would allow the status quo to continue, maybe for a year.  And we can work on some of these other suggestions.
But, you say, that's wrong because VCs.  Because home runs.  Because centralization.  
In the meantime, growth limits turn transaction capacity into a zero sum game, and force those using Bitcoin to force others off the blockchain and/or be forced of the blockchain. This also forces centralization.  Especially if the Bitcoin price is lowered, making less room for miners.

Factom stores data at a cost of about 1/10 a cent per 1K.  Mostly people will store hashes.  But you can store other information too.
And while data might be held in a database, it can actually be held anywhere by anyone.  Because if the data matches the hash in Factom, you know you have the right data.  Verifying data integrity is critical for distributed databases.

Factoids had to be sold on an exchange to establish a supply and a price.  That said, factoids are now traded, and still I do not know when shapeshift will begin to support factoids.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:32:24
That is a more rational framing of your argument.   And I agree, we pretty much have the same goals.
I simply believe users need transaction space.  I think we have seen attacks on Bitcoin that would not be possible without a hard limit.  That means we will have more in the future if we don't move the limit.  And these attacks challenge the value of the protocol.
I absolutely believe meta protocols cannot be supported without limit.  This is a point where Peter Todd and I argue now and again.  And it was my own design for more meta protocols that made me realize I needed something like Factom or I'd simply chew up the blockchain.  For what it is worth.
BTW, effectively all the big miners have locked up funds in the blockchain.  Their hardware is absolutely worthless without Bitcoin. You can't solve any other problem with hash power but hashing, and Bitcoin is the only economy that provides the returns to justify their investment.
What we need is more sources for hashing hardware, and more sources of cheap power to make them worth while. And greater value of Bitcoin to pay more people to mine.  I am not quite sure how we get there, but one of my biggest fears are these companies that produce hardware that they do not share with the public.  That is a possible centralization path that may prove hardest to circumvent.  And it resists everything, even small blocks doesn't change their position.  They view larger blocks as necessary for a bigger ecosystem, which is why they want them so much.  The math on orphans and block propogation implies they should support smaller blocks, but they think that hurts the value of Bitcoin.  And their bet is literally on a higher Bitcoin value.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:22:04
Give me an actual checklist of companies that we can support, and companies we should ban from consideration.  Of course, actually applying your method has problems. Are you saying no company has a right to be considered unless they release their personal and corporate Bitcoin holdings?


I don't understand this.  Wallet companies end up with customers dependent upon them, but this isn't a centralized thing.  And what is layer 0?  To note, all the wallet companies I have talked to want a larger block size, at least soon.
And you are right.  Adds 1MB now, and pretty much 1MB per year going forward.  In 7 years you would get where BIP101 wants to start.

Factom is a protocol to allow many meta chains to use bitcoin's pow for security.
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:55:45
Miners depend mostly on the value of Bitcoin.  Most miners believe if Bitcoin radically changes the use cases that it supports, that's bad for bitcoin's value.
And actually, low Bitcoin value centralizes Bitcoin too.  Because fewer people adopt, there is less demand, and the awards earned have less value.  So the rewards support fewer miners.
The number of full nodes has been in decline for a few years.  The declining and flat Bitcoin value is at least as much to blame as block size. Especially since we have to date always been able to grow the blocksize. But the hard limit is a change, stopping transaction growth. Restricting use of the protocol isn't going to make Bitcoin more attractive.
@_date: 2015-12-06 04:26:57

We are currently running up towards 50 Gig after having run Bitcoin for six years.  
Why, with Comcast's data caps at 300 Gig (which we all oppose, right?) you would have to use 1/6 your monthly allotment to download 6 years of data.  Which you only have to do once.  
Then the storage!  50 Gig is going to set you back as much as 3 cents (Assuming a [3TB drive for 80 dollars](
I get that Bitcoin is growing in volume.  So your network load is going to go up, your storage costs are going up, etc.   But if the full node was properly optimized and neatly packaged, all of this could be run on a very modest machine for nearly no detectable cost.
In contrast, millions of people use Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Youtube.   All of which eat vastly greater bandwidth and other resources.

Well, providing the service IS what we are working to do.  And if people cannot read about 20 sentences (a short page), then what can I say?  I would expect people to read the article.  It just isn't that hard.
We misspoke about DBS, and admitted that quickly.  
As far as the link to the dishwasher fights, the point of that article is the need to develop reputation and identity for IOT (Internet of Things) applications.  And how Factom can play in that space.  
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:08:03
Squeezing out use cases (as you suggest with fees here) isn't without (to some) unexpected impacts.   
Miners have operational costs that go beyond the short term, that are none the less devoted to mining.  After all, what data center really needs that much power and cooling?  I'll give you some short term thinking if you will yield a little more long term investment.
You talk about the expense of chips and the need for distribution of chips.  That market has trended to self use by producers, but note that trend only gained ground during flat bitcoin prices.  Because that destroyed the market for the chips anyway.   I don't know how to manage the centralized mining problem without making mining more profitable.  Yet established miners will have the advantage in cornering those profits.... It is a problem. In my mind, the problem isn't much related to block size.

Another lie you say.  Really?  I lied? ... Let's see if we can figure that out.  What did I say?


I think that was you.   Isn't it?  **oops.  Maybe that was a lie... We are a month short of a year.  Sorry.**


I think that was the right link.  Is it broken for you?  I just checked and it seems to be right.


Luckily Yahoo has a transcript feature.  It ended with the following (partial) summary:
30:03 **Chris:** Well, we have people encroaching our space. We'll wrap this up soon. One or two more questions.
30:08 Granted there's a little bit of a controversy there because I think somebody, it was either
30:13 misquoted, or expressed that a good number of books will be stored on block chain. And
30:17 then people were kind of taking it apart. Maybe they were being a little pedantic. You
30:21want to clarify the record on that, just so that we can broadcast that to the community?
30:25 **Paul:** Oh, certainly. It's a tempest in a teapot. We did a demo where we took somewhere near
30:38 29,000 books out of the Gutenberg library, all public domain, open source books. And
30:46 we entered a hash for each book along with metadata, the author, the title, that sort
30:56 of thing. And created an entry and entered it into a chain in Factom. So there's a Gutenberg
31:03 chain in Factom. It has an entry for each book. It has also this metadata in it. And
31:11 then through Factom and the level D.B., you can do a search and find that book and data.
31:17 And you could rehash the book, and verify, and validate this book is exactly the one
31:22 they had when they created with this chain.
31:25 So over time, a hundred years from now, if they found a set of books, and some of them
31:32 were corrupted, and some of them weren't, they could figure out what was corrupted,
31:35 what wasn't, and validate them against the Factom chain.
31:39 **Chris:** So that's the official answer.
31:40 **Paul:** That's the demo.
31:41 **Chris:** That's the expounded answer.
31:43 **Paul:** Yes. But what was the reason? To secure books? No. The reason was this is something you could
31:50 download, read yourself, see how we used the A.P.I. because all the code is open source.
31:55 And you can say, "Oh, I would like to secure medical records," or "I would like to secure
31:59 legal documents." Well, of course, you would do it exactly the same way. But I don't actually
32:05 have legal documents or medical records that I'd want to use in the demo so we used some
32:10 other source of data.
32:11 **Chris: Okay. That seemed like a very easy enough clarification. So there you go. Not a big**
32:13 **deal. We appreciate the transparency, of course. You only get so much time in front of a microphone**
32:19 **on the stage, and people pick and choose little bits and pieces and you know...**
32:23 **Paul:** I think most of the criticism was coming from people that weren't in the talk. Because,
32:27 I think, it was fairly clear in the talk this was a demo so that people could see how the
32:32 A.P.I. was.
32:32 **Chris:** I wasn't there in the talk. I'm at these conferences always, but in this room. Right now, you are
32:39 missing a talk as well.
32:41**Paul:** No!
32:42 **Chris:** You only have so much time. And we only do what we can. So hopefully...
32:43 **Paul:** Well, the video is available. Mo is putting the video out within 24 hours.
32:46 **Chris:** Yes. That's what I typically do. I'm the last one to see all the conference videos. I have
32:50 to hear bits and pieces from everybody at the show. But it's nice to get reviews on
32:54 who did what before it comes out.
32:56 **Paul:** Sure.
32:57 **Chris:** I know where to focus my attention. Well, Paul, it was wonderful to meet you and to
33:00 interview you. Is there anything else you want to say to the audience? Where can they
33:03 learn more about Factom?
33:05 **Paul:** You can go to the Factom.org. From there, you can find our white paper. From there you
33:09 can find the consensus paper that we've released for review. You can find the links to the
33:17 Gutenberg demo. And you can find the explorer that lets you look at the records that were
33:23 entered and see how it works. The A.P.I. is documented. If you're a developer, you can
33:31 play with that. And of course, you can find contact information to us.
It seems in the interview you had your questions answered, and seemed to acknowledge the transparency.


I am not exactly sure how in person you seem to acknowledge the transparency and the explanations, and even say "no big deal".   But here you can't even discuss anything.
I think it is fair to say I don't know what exactly has changed.  I think it is fair to say something has.

It can take as much as 120 seconds to propagate blocks to 90 percent of the miners.  Here is one such example [on the second of May](  While this isn't typical, when Bitcoin was designed, there were no networks from which to measure statistics.  A ten minute block time makes even such periodic delays like this manageable for miners (they have only a 20% penalty rather than a 100% penalty were the block time 2 minutes).
The other issue though is that mining is concentrated in certain regions.   So if a very large concentration of miners, representing only 20% of the miners but 60% of the mining power, the 4 second propagation time doesn't apply to them;  the propagation time that matters is how fast a miner gets the next block.  Those 20% would have no delay 60 percent of the time.

There are in fact many "world wide webs" since many international companies run their own intranets and their own virtual private networks.

This is a real world problem that can be addressed by creating immutable audit trails.  Keep in mind, that these audit trails allow LESS propagation of personal information rather than more.  This is because with immutable audits, a KYC/AML service can track the information required by law, but only propagate *answers* (i.e. individual is over 21, individual is a citizen of the U.K, etc.) rather than data (i.e. individual was born on 4/7/1972, individual's U.K. Passport number is 965854308, etc.).  
Your bank, your doctor, your employer, and others who may be required by law to verify information about you may someday do so without gaining all your personal information.  
But this requires such verification and validation services to be completely auditiable in a way that can ensure 1) the information collected followed strict processes to the letter, that 2) the information collected is the information used to respond to queries, that 3) the queries themselves were vetted using strict processes to the letter, that 4) the responses to the queries were corrrect given the information held at that time (responses might very over time).
All of this requires strict immutable audit trails, something that Factom provides.

You have government backed monopolies for all practical purposes at the moment.  If you have regulated everyone out of the market outside AT&amp;T, Time Warner, Cox, and a couple of others (we have a choice of 2 of the above where my office is)  you do not have competition.

Give it a rest.   The signature under SW is not validated by old nodes, only new nodes.  Because the signature isn't where the old nodes expect it.
I get the whole "miners get to follow whatever rules they like about choosing transactions" thing.   No avoiding that really; it is a feature of the protocol.   But in the case of SW you really do have a signature, and SW nodes really can validate said signature, and old nodes really cannot validate said signature.  It isn't about secret requirements of addresses and colluding miners.  It is about new code that fools old code into accepting transactions without validating the signatures.
You made the list, and used the wording you used is your own.  And a long explanation about how miners can do an end run around the ability of a node to validate transactions is of course interesting in some sense, but it is also a counter argument against the idea that nodes can validate transactions.

They did what engineers do, succeed where engineering is what matters most.   They are not consumer facing, nor produce mass market products.
That is one vision for Bitcoin too.   I get that, and that is a path for success, even if it is more limited than it could be.  And Bitcoin can cede the mass market to some other technology or blockchain.  I think the happier path would be to serve as the foundation for some other technology that enables mass markets, like the Lightning Network.   That latter approach will necessarily require collecting market data and being responsive to the industry, and that is different than what we have done.
If you think I don't believe in the technology, you haven't been paying attention.  It is because I believe in the technology that I believe we can solve problems, be responsive, take market share, and change the world.   I don't believe engineering is enhanced by ignoring data, ignoring the industry, and not planning for risks in advance.  I know you think little of my efforts, but I started two years ago working to make an aspect of Bitcoin scale, i.e. data on the blockchain.  
I'm not just blathering about this topic, like many do.

From the first link:


From the second link: **edit:  Links changed on me.  This was the [link we started with.](  The [bitcoinist article]( pulls from this link as a source, and doesn't much pay attention to my responses.**










The only thing I should have added but didn't until later on in the chat linked to above was that there isn't anything in the article in question that said we had a contract.  This is actually the main reasoning our contacts had for leaving it alone.  There just wasn't anything to materially correct. I gave you the quote about the timeline for a prototype with a goal for something real, from the article in question.  Why would anyone read that and think we had a contract to do land titles?  This is (and continues slowly as) a project under negotiation. 
And if we are guilty of "outrageous lies", how is it that I am the source?  Wasn't it my statement that is at the source of all of this? I was asked a question, I gave a straight up engineering answer, which is that the contract isn't there yet. *(Actually, I wasn't even asked a question.  I responded to a statement, and made the record clear without being asked.)*
The project isn't dead yet either.  It is just like any government negotiation, it takes lots of time.  Some of the people here were simply way too optimistic.  We are a young team, and we are fixing these things.
So exactly what is the lie then?

There is a point of diminishing returns, where they have more to gain from trashing us than we have to gain by defending ourselves.   Heck, you again are the case study.  I have spent hours and hours and hours in many different forums discussing Factom, pointing out the real state of the project, discussing how and why we have a token.... And for what? You still buy their story and think we haven't been transparent, and you even imply I am misrepresenting a history that is all documented in writing.  
Frankly I believe you'd be on my side if you really read the entire exchanges yourself, and read some of the documentation we have put out there.  Assuming you have a bit of an open mind of course.  If all altcoins that are not Bitcoin are all scams in your book, then there isn't much hope for me to convince you otherwise.

I have discussed the project with junseth, but there is a point where the discussion breaks down.  Read your own link to the discussion.  I repeatedly asked them what I asked you:   what is the lie?
I have been asked for months to retract our claims, but what do I have to retract?  I gave a clear statement of where the project stands.  We are continuing to negotiate.  Why would I say we are not?  We had a goal for a prototype by the end of the year, and we have pushed that off.  What else is there to do?
Bitcoin isn't defined by Silk Road, and Factom isn't defined by the behavior of all altcoins.  Unless you think mainstream accusations of Bitcoin == drugs, crime, and terrorism is fair journalism, why do the same thing to other projects?


The token is all Sold.  Finished may 15.  The token was distributed, and done so openly, and funds tied to delivery of the tech.  2/3 are still being held waiting on two more milestones. All of this was public, and Chris and Josh could have discussed how we are structured, but it doesn't fit their narrative.  


I don't think I refused the out.  I suggested it.  I'm confused.
But about this idea we pumped the token sale with this announce...
The article came out hours after the token sale was complete.  At one point I thought there was some overlap, but one of our guys did some review, and there was none.
Again, something that doesn't fit the narrative.  Had there been any overlap, it would have been only hours from publishing in India and the close of the sale at 10am CST.  Turns out there wasn't even that.


Didn't meet timelines discussed.  What else is there?  You have the article and the discussion with Chris and Josh that is the basis for all of this.  In the end we made a statement to both update the status, and as a counterpoint to articles that simply regurgitated Chris and josh's accusations... Note that these articles proceeded with no input from us.
I can provide more links to discussions with them that occurred later.  I interviewed with Chris a couple of times in the past. But without any good faith on their part to discuss the project, why subject ourselves to more insults and misrepresentations?

Not really discussed at the first Scaling Bitcoin Conference, but quite a bit by all parties at the second.  There was clear and strong support to increase the block size at the second.  A step to 2 meg was supported by everyone stating a position, and not strongly opposed by anyone.  
I know of no opposition voice by any miner, wallet company, payment processor, or other Bitcoin business in attendance.  I know of nobody in these groups opposed to SW, but also none that thought it was a substitute.

Don't have to "plug my fingers" in my ears if you can't produce an actual quote demonstrating a lie.  I actually use "reading comprehension" techniques and advanced "quote technology" from your sources to show conclusively we told the truth.
The solution to the double spend requires an immutable ledger.  


Currently, maybe, but not once it is distributed and all nodes check the rules. 
[ItBit]( holds the funds, with Michael Perkin and another third party as signers required for release of funds.  So no, we can't change those rules.


Who holds the wallet in a distributed protocol if it uses Bitcoin?  Nobody for Bitcoin when it pays out rewards of course.  And nobody in our protocol, because it too has its own token.  If our protocol could distribute control of Bitcoin, We'd be a sidechain.  
The difficulty of managing an outside token is why currently  trusted 3rd parties are required for 2 way pegs.  That may change, but forgive me if we couldn't do what other better funded and smarter teams have yet to do either.
And if our goal is to limit blockchain space for data security with Bitcoin, how does that work if each entry is paid for with Bitcoin?  Unless a trusted third party provided the service?
Then we are not distributed.


Distributed protocols may need their own accounting, which may be a token. Centralized services not so much.  
But this equating a small raise with profits... You are against profits then?  We're early Bitcoin people profiting handsomely from early buys.  Does your condemnation include that?  Why not?  What is allowed and what isn't, and why?
Since you are back on the lies and liar theme, why don't you produce a lie for me to retract?
And go read the LTB thread.  What was the accusation that I ignored?  What question was asked that I didn't respond to?  And what did I say that these "critics" refuted in amy way other that to give links that don't prove their claims?
What use is this to anyone?
You really are no better.  You can't actually discuss quotes that make your points, because there are none.  You accuse me of filtering the history, but can't produce a single example of such behavior on my part.  I have just quoted the sources **you claimed** showed poor behavior, and those quotes prove you wrong. Or that you are lying?
In a thread about lying, this is pretty rich.  You  now seem committed to standing by claims your own sources prove to be false.

Never used the term "governance model" for a 51% attack.  In fact, I point out that the attack compromises the set of rules everyone else expects.  I picked blacklists as an example, because I (and I'd guess most here) view that as a hugely destructive idea that could be enforced on the rest of us.
The hope is that greater than 50% of the hash power follows the rules;  if they do, then everything is okay.

This is real simple.  All of that, sure.  But also some set of transactions SW wallets and code could tell are invalid but...
Wait for it...
Old code cannot.
This.  Is. Not. A. Big. Point.
But old code will not be as secure as SW code.


Because some people take zero confirmations.  Not a lot, not usually for large sums, but some.  And (assuming you can validate a transaction) it isn't that insecure, especially if you know the people involved.
Does SW significantly change the security?  No.  I said and said that.
Good night.

In one case, I have to manage the two wives, and ... wait, okay that isn't what you were asking, but heck!  Let's roll with that!
Many wives can exist.   But I "only" have to deal with mine.  But if I had two, then not only do I have to interact with each, those interactions could interfere with each other.  I can't even imagine how that would work.
Same with two coexisting forks on the same node network and protocol.  Valid signed transactions on one are, as Gavin pointed out, valid signed transactions on the other.  Particularly in the beginning, and only gaining independence as rewards mined puts transactions on each fork that cannot be cleared by the other fork.
And as Gavin points out, since all existing wealth in Bitcoin will move in both forks when a transaction is submitted and is valid on both chains. But some transactions will only move in one fork (if the 'coin doesn't exist on both forks).  Or some won't register because for whatever reason the transaction won't clear.
It gets better when you consider what it means to raise the blocksize on a minority fork that doesn't go along.  Piles and piles of transactions become available (presumably) that don't fit in the smaller block.  And the smaller block takes a really long time to confirm, making the backlog terribly unpredictable.
The whole thing becomes a big mess.   The obvious answer, just like my son's room, is to just close the door and ignore the lesser fork and spend my time in my own room, where of course my (only) wife ensures the room is comfortable and livable.  
Neglect causes the minor fork to die a quick (or long) and silent (or chaotic) death.
Unless as you say someone comes along and hard forks it.  Which makes sense, because the reason (in this particular case) the minor fork existed anyway is because everyone opposed.... hard forks.   LIke revolting over taxes so you revolt and set up a tax system as the first and founding act.




Sorry, couldn't parse what you are trying to say there.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:14:00
But if anyone "dissents" with SW, they just see transactions that look like they validate (even if they don't).  They still get smaller blocks.  It is a soft fork; everyone gets the same blocks.
The problem comes in if SW goes active, but later loses support with miners. If SW falls below 50 percent with miners and and SW miners still validate SW transactions but the majority doesn't THEN blocks that contain invalid SW transactions are accepted by the dissenters, but are rejected by those validating SW transactions.  AT THAT POINT, the lack of SW among miners forces a hard fork, with dissenters running along with blocks containing stolen SW funds, while SW nodes are locked out of the chain with the most PoW by the majority hash power.
Dissenters in wallets and full nodes in the rest of the market WILL track the same transactions with SW.  **If a majority (bigger is better) of the miners care about SW** and very few in the market care, then all the validation that matters is still done by miners, and the clients still track the same transactions, and those wishing to use SW can do so, even if the rest of the network (sans miners) doesn't generate or properly validate SW transactions.  Invalid SW transactions can be submitted, but they will get no confirmations.  And dissenter wallets will still track that reality.
For better or for worse (I think for better) once SW is implemented, it cannot be undone without huge damage to SW users and likely catastrophic damage to Bitcoin.  We just need to understand this, though it is no different than with P2SH.
**tl;dr** SW is a soft fork if SW is the majority.  Everyone gets the same blocks, even if they don't take the upgrade.  If SW goes active but falls into the minority, SW becomes a hard fork.   If SW becomes active but nobody submits SW transactions, there is NO change to blocks.

Not sure silence is an outrageous lie when.... we were not silent.  Again, I am the source here, not someone else.  I have done AMAs, and I respond to anyone.  I won't interview with Junseth, but I have repeatedly offered to actually discuss any issues on any public forum. 
This got extensive discussion on Lets Talk Bitcoin's forum, and Josh and Chris got banned because they refused to discuss anything I raised. Not that they attacked me, but that they refused to discuss anything.  At all.  Then they just got ridiculous. To my knowledge, they are the only ones ever banned by Adam.
I get the wild marketing claims, if there were such things.   We have actual leather and sweat behind every project we have discussed in the press.  That said, only a few of them will be real, because that's the way this works.   But none of them are real if you don't get out there and make them happen.  And for a start up, that is about letting people know what you are doing, and with whom.
We haven't profited vastly from the token.  In fact, it was sold pretty cheap, and that's that.  There is no inflation until we get all parts of the protocol running, so we are not pre-mining anything.  And at this point 2/3 of the crowdsale is locked up by a third party  until we deliver the last two milestones, subject again to third party audit.
So again, we are not perfect.  The software is harder than expected.  But we are diligent and we are a real effort.

Nah, I am not sore at Chris and Josh at all.  I talked to them in Miami at the conference there, and I'd be happy to talk to them anywhere and any time in person or on any forum on the Internet.   If they could demonstrate the ability to carry on a conversation (which is a two way thing, you know?) then I'd even to an interview with them.  But lacking that, I don't want to contribute to their efforts by giving them an interview.
The problem is that I have gone out of my way to engage them, and have spent hours and hours talking in their direction in forums that were supposed to house an exchange of information, and what they did was continue to repeat crap that wasn't supported by their sources, and is in conflict with, well, any reasonable understanding of reality.
So while I like these guys personally, and while I don't even mind the opposition to my project and work, and while I really, really do welcome opposition, I'm not doing interviews with them until they can demonstrate the ability to carry on a conversation.
Let me be clear.  I am not demanding they agree with me at all.  Nor that they quit opposing or even making fun of me or my work.  I don't seek out people that agree with me;  I seek out and prefer to talk to people who have opposing views so that I can understand better the weaknesses in my own, and to incorporate new ideas to improve what I am doing.
Or put another way, the only feedback they seem to hear is my refusal to talk to them or insult them.  Why should I?  As I said, they are smart, funny guys.  I (secretly so don't tell anyone) even listen to their podcast from time to time.   But I want a conversation, or an actual match of ideas.  I'll not be just a simple prop for a script they have already committed to.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:57:58
So.  Are fewer or the same number of nodes validating signatures before SW as after deployment?
Of course fewer.
Is the ability of miners to apply arbitrary rules on transactions changed in any way by SW?  
Of course not.
So talking about miners and the rules they might apply to transactions is unrelated to validation of SW signatures on transactions.  In this case they must apply SW rules or Bitcoin breaks.  That is all.
I believe SW is important and good.  But I'm not going to pretend it doesn't reduce the number of nodes that can do signature validation, at least until all nodes are upgraded.
Only up to date full nodes apply all rules.  Old nodes potentially pass invalid transactions along, to be caught by upgraded miners as the last defense.

I think he was, but had not factored in mining pools and ASICs. 
And he might have been more accepting of centralization than our current core devs.  A data rate of 15 million X ~300 byte transactions is what, 4.5 Gig? Then push that to 8 peers, you have a bandwidth requirement of 36 Gig per day?  Not really that bad for a datacenter based node.
Even 100 G/day is only ~9 Mbps (if I did the math right:  100 G/day x 8 bits / 24 hours /60 minutes / 60 seconds).   A Datacenter could do way better than that, or even just Google fiber. 
But is VISA truly a global currency/payment system?   I think VISA is just a payment network, and Bitcoin aims higher, with greater requirements to reach what Bitcoin aspires to be.  I believe most on the "scale on-chain now" side would still support the need for networks like Lightning and Sidechains to reach that kind of global scale long term.  It isn't fair to paint them (us... I'll put myself there) as opposed to long term solutions.

One:  many of us supporting a move to 2mb blocks are engineers.
Two:  the consensus of the second scaling Bitcoin Conference was to raise to 2 MB WHILE implementing SW and LN.  Of course, neither conference put conclusions in writing, so I guess it utterly failed in that regard, if everyone went home thinking they "won".
Neither SW nor LN are likely to increase transaction volume in the next year. Both of these solutions rely on a cascade of deployments, where delays in wallet up grades, infrastructure development and testing, user education, and the fact that complicated stuff takes more time that you would like.

You don't have to take my word for anything.  At all.  You don't have to "remember" the timeline.  Just look it up. Seriously.
We have never said the Honduras project was "just a discussion".  So who is lying here?  We never said we had a contract to do a land titling system.  In the original article, we talked about a prototype by the end of 2015, and a goal of a full land titling system.
So am I afraid of "tough questions"?  Absolutely not.  I have answered questions posed to me.  I am willing to answer your questions.   I'm willing to stand on a public record.  I quote the articles you give me to defend my position.
There is a difference between someone who will "hold your feet to the fire" and people that are irresponsible, inflammatory, and simply seek destruction of your work.

True, but if you can *validate the transactions in a block and determine that it contains invalid transactions* you have a "guarantee" (not really, but more on that later) that the block will be rejected, as long as your rules match those of the miners.
You cannot detect such invalid transactions if your rules are not upto date with SW once SW is adopted.
POW gives you certainty that approaches 100 percent as blocks are built on your block.  So no, a mined block does NOT come with "zero guarantee" (I don't even know how to define "guarantee" in this context, since there is no 3rd party "guaranteeing" anything in Bitcoin), but with a level of certainty that increases as blocks are built.




An SW output can be sent to your address. Asking for money to a SW address is not the only interaction possible between the old world and the new.  But can you validate such a spend to your old address without SW code?




But can you detect *invalid blocks*?  Or are you claiming that being able to run the same validation rules the miners use is of no use?
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:15:39
I so agree with you.
Obama is calling for a "Balance" defined as the Government's ability to access your data to determine your purchases, your accounts, your news feeds, your interests, your finances, your circle of friends, your business connections, your conversations, your social platforms, your religious beliefs, your politics, your organizations, your plans, your investments, your past, your photos, your videos, and anything else that access to your phone might provide.
All upon demand, and perhaps without any legal due process.
The other side of the "Balance" is that you are responsible for anything bad that might come of such access.  Not a little thing, since everyone who gains access to the Government's methods will be able to break in just like them.  And who will be responsible for that?  Your phone, your responsibility.

 Why are digi
Not that you really want information, or that you are really  going to discuss this here or anywhere else, but it is a legitimate question so here is an answer.
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:45:03
No such thing as a "guarantee" in Bitcoin.  Please talk about levels of confidence.
    guar·an·tee
    ˌɡerənˈtē/
    noun
    1. a formal promise or assurance (typically in writing) that certain conditions will be fulfilled, especially that a product will be repaired or replaced if not of a specified quality and durability.
    "we offer a 10-year guarantee against rusting"
    synonyms:	warranty More
    2. LAW  a formal pledge to pay another person's debt or to perform another person's obligation in the case of default.
Proving the positive is done in bitcoin with POW which builds with each "confirmation" or block added over the block holding your transaction.   Proving the negative is done by validation of transactions.   Giving up on the latter because the former is a process that takes time isn't logical.   Nodes need to detect invalid transactions so they do not spam the network with them.  Nodes need to detect invalid blocks and not relay them.
I know you are just trolling, but seriously why would you suggest that verification isn't important to the health of the protocol just because there exists issues you cannot fix with verification?  Heck, verification of transactions can't get teenagers to clean their rooms either.  So nobody needs verification?  
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:07:17


We all care about blocks


If you are spending from or sending money to a SW address you care.  If  SW transactions are in a block with yours, you care.  If your node is asked to relay a transaction, you care.


You have a SW transaction, you care if miners record, don't record, or record a bogus spend of your funds.  Your whole argument about SW being safe is that this will be properly done by miners.  So even if nodes you talk to don't understand your signatures, they will be validated by the miners.

Users have to upgrade and or change wallets.  Some will demand the ability to create old style transactions, since legacy infrastructure won't validate transaction signatures.
Really, most of the great lengths some people went through to persist paper tickets historically is instructive in understanding why we should not discount  3) when it comes to increasing transaction limits.  The benefit of SW depends solely on adoption in the end, and some level of user participation is required, or at least preferred.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:09:30
A lot of words, yet it remains that miners validate, select, and order transactions, and in Bitcoin secure them via pow.  As long as a majority follow the rules, the rules hold.
As long as the transactions validate in a block, rules for selection and additional validation are indistinguishable from the rest.  That miners do not exert the full extent of what they can do is great.  That they might is a worry.

I'm not sure why my defense of Erik implies I'm complaining about Greg Maxwell.  I read what you wrote about Erik and responded to that.
I think driving the protocol right up to the block limit is as dangerous for centralization as large block sizes.  I believe a fee market without decentralized transaction channels already in place and working  is a centralization risk.  
I think SW as the transaction pressure solution (even if wonderful for all other fixes and benefits) is a polite but firm refusal to address the concerns in the market.  It's a partial relief 6 to 8 months out.  LN will also require additional blockspace.  
Factom can move meta protocols off the blockchain, but despite being live since September, 1) I'm not sure how much moving meta protocols will help, and 2) how to get them to move, and 3) we still have work to do on the protocol itself.
I went to both Scaling Bitcoin Conferences.  I heard the concerns being delivered.  The response that came back did not appear to be a suitable reply to the concerns.  If you are not concerned about transaction accommodation, I can then understand your confusion.  But if you really are in the middle, but are listening and taking to heart the concerns, you might understand the communication issue better.

Agreed.  When you challenged me to defend our "Outrageous Lies" (that was the challenge, right?) , it was perhaps unreasonable for me to expect you to actually be able to detail even one clear lie.  The strawman I pursued was the idea we would proceed like engineers:
* First, identify a lie
* Second, discuss the statement.  If it was in fact false, admit to the "lie", correct the record, issue a retraction, apologize, or whatever.
This discussion, as it turns out, isn't about anything so objective and systematic.  Keep in mind, we are not talking about avoiding any particular wording.  I gave you the statement we literally made about the project, and we literally told the truth.  And what we said is by any measure objectively in conflict with your claim of both 1) what we said, and 2) the impression you claim we gave.
I have not attacked you.  Not even once, except to point out that you are not giving me anything objective to work with.  Well, maybe if I call you out for lying when you say things you can't back up, and are in conflict with the sources you give me?  Is that an attack?  
Waving your hands around and saying that people are mislead when you can't even produce any examples of that... Well, I have to call that out.  I can't address hand waving.  And as for the idea I should ask for forgiveness because Chris and Josh can wring their hands and moan loudly, and managed to get a guy to repeat their wailing,  that would not be fair to my team, the people that invested in Factom,  people that bought tokens, the people building applications with Factom, nor even the public at large.  
Everyone deserves fair and objective information, not spins, misrepresentations, and drummed up accusations.  Which is why I"d still go back to the two step plan detailed above.
I have nothing to deny, because you **have yet to give me something to deny** other than your stated claims about what was said that, in fact, never was said in the first place.  
"...but quoting why repeatedly..." But that is EXACTLY the problem.  On any objective point where you literally point to an article or a conversation, I have objectively addressed the issue, and explained (with quotes and proof) that your accusations are false.   At the same time, I have totally given you your emotional objection to our project.  But the latter isn't proof we are a con, that we have lied, or that we have failed to do everything we can to deliver exactly what we documented we were going to do.
You have even accused us of failing to implement governance to ensure outside parties that we are following the rules we set up with Koinify about how the token sales would be collected, and what was required of us to receive those funds.  And I have objectively detailed what our governance is, and I can put you in contact with people to confirm said governance.  But you have dropped that accusation, so are you good with that?
Now your new theme is that I'm just trying to "score points in some game".  
Quit stalling.   I'll quit saying that you are misrepresenting our project, or our efforts, our negotiations with Honduras, or anything at all **if you would just give me a bullet list of what you litterally object to, and some citation to demonstrate your objection is real**.

Here is a list of "Issues" that you have raised, or statements you have made that are materially in error or mischaracterize the facts.  I'll give you the option to activate any of them that you wish to defend.  I actually got tired of this, and skipped quite a few.  If you want more, we can do that.
* [This is not how it was pushed in the PR - that it was a tentative deal](
We have not ever said we have a contract, nor anything beyond the objective of a prototype that might lead to a deal.  Activate this issue, and I'll be happy to provide quotes and sources.
* [The whole idea of your "immutable" ledger doesn't make sense on the face of it. This is software, it can and will change](
A subjective statement that isn't actually supported by a reference or logical argument.  And for business use cases involving literally the entire Bitcoin market cap, Bitcoin is immutable enough.  Activate this issue, and we can discuss what immutable refers to, and if it is good enough for the business processes that Factom would address.
* [Then you publish a mea culpa, that you got ahead of yourselves in the PR blitz](
This is a misrepresentation of the blog post in question.  Activate this issue, and we can discuss what the definition of a "mea culpa" is and if the blog qualifies.
* [It's a glossing over of history.  The Honduras "deal" was widely sold as finished in the media and pushed by your own blog.](
Activate this issue and we will go over the timeline of the "history" of this accusation and if I have represented it correctly.   And we can go over the definition of "finished" and if a prototype leading to a goal qualifies as a "finished" deal.
* [Wait, was the Honduras deal misrepresented or not? If not? Why the apology later on the blog? How do you have it both ways? I was around during the intervening time between the statement and there apology, reading articles and discussion about this. Radio silence from Factom. Hard to quote this lack of response](
Activate this issue, and we can discuss 1) How Honduras deal was misrepresented, 2) the definition of an apology and if we gave one, 3) what articles and disucssions you read (they should still exist), and 4) the definition of radio silence and if we qualify.
*  [I took back their claims, even though I feel they are mostly correct but not thoroughly researched enough to be concrete.](
Activate this issue and we can discuss what their claims are, and if, in fact, you have taken back their claims.
* [You refuse to take the offered out of exuberant marketing though, even after I offered that as a compromise. This makes you seem defensive, you can't accept that your strong "marketing" seems like a lie when it is presented to sell an investment in Factom coins?](
Activate this issue, and we will look at the record to see if I refused anything, and if in fact it was you that offered a compromise.  Also, we can discuss what constitutes "exuberant marketing", if any lies were told, and if it was used to sell a token.  And if this really even belongs in a discussion of "Outrageous Lies".
* [The way you characterize the history of this sounds very suspect to me because it conflicts with my own recollection, not any article calling you out specifically](
Activate this issue, and we can discuss the nature of the Internet and recorded conversations, and impossible task I would face if I were to really try and "characterize the history" differently than it is, when it is all dated and recorded.
* [So, you could say that the facts are quite simple: yes it was oversold, yes we didn't clarify it or offer an update until well after we were called out on it.](
Activate this issue and we can discuss why companies do not clarify articles that do not contain any material errors or misstatements.  We can also discuss how we openly and actively discussed the project with Chris and Josh, not that the discussion was led by them calling us out.
*  [That Factom was open and honest about the Honduras deal, when the majority and the reporting were under the mistaken impression that it was more than a discussion. ](
Activate this issue, and we will discuss what "a discussion" is, and if there is more to the Honduras project than just "a discussion".
So BTW, I am purposely not including your objection to our governance on the distribution of the crowd sale funds.  After all, you have no source to verify or invalidate my statements.  What I can suggest is 3rd party validation of this, and I can put you in contact with people to do that validation if you like.  This was a fair statement on your part, and an objective issue that I am happy to address.
Fair enough?

Thanks.  This is a great write up about full nodes and their role in the network.   A slight caveat though
Note that if your node disagrees with the miners, then your client is frozen.  No transactions out (that you can see) and no transaction confirmations (that you understand).
If all the nodes disagree with the miners then only "agreeable" transactions get passed to the miners.  Then they do what they do, and send out blocks that ... go nowhere because the network won't send them around.
If some or most of the nodes agree with the miners, then the odd node out is frozen, but everyone else (assuming some signaling to know not to connect to an old node) is fine.
Like any distributed network, we all depend on each other.   There isn't a player that stands alone.

POW is rule by the majority of the hash power.   The 51% attack is a recognition that a majority, like it or not, can set the rules in Bitcoin.   This means soft forks, like deploying blacklists where some Bitcoin are deemed unspendable, are perfectly possible with Bitcoin as long as the majority (that word) miners don't build on blocks that break their rules.
We want to minimize the power of the majority in every single case, except where we don't and where we cant.

Engineers are not always their own customers.  In the case here, Bitcoin core doesn't do a significant amount of mining, no payment processing, sell no goods and services for Bitcoin.  They don't run exchanges, nor develop wallets (past the reference implementation).   They basically do not participate to a significant economic degree as actual users of Bitcoin today in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
What makes them uniquely qualified to understand then the issues faced by so many people who do participate in the ecosystem, and depend on Bitcoin for their businesses?  I mean, more so that those in the ecosystem that have traveled to conferences over the last four or five months, held around the world, all to communicate their concerns?
Even the core developers recognize the need for more communication between developers and everyone else.   They may be resisting the idea that this communication should be deliberate, that they should invest actual time and energy to find people to do this.   And in particular, they may resist listening to the results.  Still, there is no doubt that more communication and responsiveness would vastly improve the process.
If you want to call that "politicians", then so be it.  I prefer to call it analysis, responsiveness, and intelligence, but use whatever label you like.

Yes Obama, keeping strong encryption strong IS the right answer.
Unless you think the rest of the world should be able to break into DOD databases, financial institutions and banks, organizations, personal emails, business communications, and the rest.
The fact is that strong encryption is strong encryption.   It doesn't ever, ever, ever go away if people use it.  But it turns out to be really, really hard to keep private keys private.  So the way you deal with strong encryption is the old fashioned way.  Police work, investigations, informants, etc. 
And BTW we have always been able to secure information such that no government can get at it.  We used to just burn the evidence.  So a phone can be burned.   Quit crying and recognize there are limits to what the government can do.
And that is as it should be.

Wow.  Really?  With zero confirmations someone would have to attack the entire chain to supply an invalid transaction?
Who knew?
Of course, from the very beginning I said an old client is protected from invalid transactions if SW miners validate the transation.

Give me something concrete to discuss.  An actual lie or even a material misrepresentation.  Here is some feed back from LTB, for example:
[Posted by mdw](










Let's assume mdw isn't just posturing for effect, and he really does know Josh and Chris, and he doesn't much know Factom.  Since neither Josh nor Chris called him out (and he seems to use an actual real world identity), I think that's fair.   How is it he can review the conversation and see the same repeated asks for an actual lie ignored by Josh and Chris (and yourself) as a bit of evidence against the accusation, and you cannot?  You are claiming I'm rationalizing, but all I am asking for is an actual lie.
Your claim that impressions are lies seems a bit much.  After all, when I reviewed articles written based on the original article, none of them claimed we had a contract, and most picked up on the prototype effort as a step towards a contract.   If you have sources that seem to be mislead, give me an example.   And this project continues to be negotiated, and I still am optimistic it will go through at some point.  If they choose another solution or close the negotiations, we will update the community.  Until that point, why would we poison the project by either shutting down negotiations, or claiming them shut down (effectively the same thing) while we are still pursuing it?

I don't think this is a justification for going to a couple of scaling Bitcoin conferences, nodding their heads at everything said, then just doing what they wanted to do in the first place.
Having a hard limit close to the market's transaction volume subjects everyone using Bitcoin to DOS attacks.  We have already seen a couple purposfull "stress tests" that only cost a total of something like 40k dollars.  Such attacks get cheaper every day.
We knew this.  We know this.  Businesses with business models that require flows of Bitcoin transactions have weighed in.  And we hear core devs saying that dropping  business models that don't work is just fine.  That really, this just means going offline for a few months until solutions become real.  That this lack of support and intervention is okay.
And in the near future the blocksize will be increased anyway.
Sorry if I don't get this logic.

I have no such thesis.  Gavin explains why two forks in the same network don't persist.   You did get the whole "two wives" analogy, didn't you?   Where have we ever in any alt-coin or otherwise seen two forks persist?




Yeah, HODLers are really happy with the FUD suppressed value of Bitcoin, I'm sure.   I'm at least as much of a HODLer as most, and I'd rather Core care about the ecosystem more than dumping business models and opening us to DOS attacks like we suffered last year just to be purists about centralization while vastly centralizing the use cases for Bitcoin.
I listened to [Tuur]( while walking the other day.  He sees a future where Bitcoin is a settlement layer for other transactions like Gold is today.  Not much gold really moves (he estimates about 100 transactions per day) in London, NY, and a few other vaults.
Wait.  Did he really claim a need to keep bitcoin decentralized while imagining only a very, very, very select few that ever transact Bitcoin?


How many people make a fork "contentious"?  Who gets to decide who matters, and who doesn't?  Is it just development skill?   Do you have to contribute to some particular code base?  Or is it just investment in the ecosystem?  Or participation in a company building layers for expanding Bitcoin?


Not sure if it is a consensus rule that matters to a full node.   For one thing, it is the miners that determine that a block is built upon and becomes the basis for the ledger.   Furthermore, any transaction in a block that validates is likely to be present in the real block should you get a reorg.  If not, it can be resubmitted.
What is critical is to validate the transactions in a mined block.   Given that mining pools have fast connections between each other, enforcing mining rules by thinking a full node can stop their communication is naive at best and generally a wasted effort.
If you (being selfish) wish to ignore this dust up between Core and most of the ecosystem, then the best thing to do is ignore it all.  Set your limit to something safe (2 MB in the current environment perhaps) or make it configurable, and ignore it all.




Other than your old code no longer validates SW signed unspent outputs.  You seem to care about consensus rules because they are consensus rules.  Why the exception in your concern?




Both of these forks have risks.  Miners that do not upgrade get hurt, of course.  Security takes a hit to the extent nodes and miners are not properly validating transactions.
Upping the blocksize most likely stalls code that doesn't either upgrade or (my suggestion) quit looking at the blocksize at all.   The latter relies on miners in the future on this question, and suffer no risk of thinking transactions are valid which are not.
Or put another way, most code can put a "Not my problem field" over the whole blocksize issue, and suffer nearly no risk at all from doing so. (If there is a risk, I don't know what it is.)
Now I do not believe we want to stall SW deployment.  Malleability attacks hurt Factom's ability to put anchors into our data structures as quickly as we would like.  And for a while, tricked us into placing multiple anchors into Bitcoin.   So I really want SW.  
Also, by providing a place for meta protocols to go that do not burn anything more than the fixed ~13 MB of transactions in Bitcoin per year, fee pressure and small blocksizes might be a boost to our protocol.   But I take a longer view, and see the viability of Bitcoin as a protocol to be way more important than my own project.
@_date: 2016-01-25 20:11:03
I will give you "all" was too strong.  I was talking about gaining transaction volume benefit, which only comes from wallets generating SW transactions.
I will give you the hard fork/ soft fork designation.   It would be a hard fork to get rid of SW, but not to deploy it.  Since, as you say, miners failing to upgrade only lose (likely)  rewards.  And wallets that don't upgrade only don't properly validate SW transactions.  That only potentially harms people that take zero-confirmation transactions.  Otherwise, one trusts the miners.
And of course, any attack that leverages any delay in adoption of SW by miners gets to attack with invalid SW transactions and tossing hash power at blocks the rest of the network won't build on.   Maybe that lowers the bar by 5% ?   Not terribly realistic, but it is there.
FUD (maybe like pointing all of this out) may result in "features" that make SW an option when generating transactions in wallets.   If so, that also delays any benefit to Bitcoin for SW.
Any realistic assessment of SW does not suggest it will help with transaction volume as quickly as advertised.  Hopefully I am wrong, because I think restricting transaction volume is going to be very bad.

Businesses will likely charge a fee to create a channel.  So if the fee is $2 then it will cost you $4 or $5 to open it.  Then you are really selective with whom you open channels.  If the business thinks you are offline too much, they close your channel and you are out the $4.  Better to just have a few and route.  Only everyone thinks the same way. Now networks are are hard to grow.
At 5 cents, this is nothing.  At some point it tips.  The amounts above are just illustrative.

I walked out of one of the meetings, and saw Chris and Josh in their getup.  While I immediately recognized them at some level, I just froze in my tracks. It might have taken me a full minute to process their crazy costumes.
At times I find it really disappointing that they can't seem to carry on a conversation with me, because deep down they are pretty funny guys.   So with great effort I had to decline their invitation to an interview, at least three times.  But I do have to admit they can be funny.  And they were not overly obnoxious.  Okay, maybe a little, but balanced with the usual heavy helping of humor.
Then there are us, the invited attendees.  Sure, quite a lot of us are babies, with big egos, whine too much, and are too self important, and the rest.  And quite a number of us are truly worried about the protocol.  No doubt I cry, whine, strut, and all the rest, so I guess it was my crowd.
It is almost like we are people.  Huh. Who'd thought?
Bruce is a genuinely nice and well meaning guy.   The conference was a good idea, and did some good.  Enough?  Maybe so, most likely not.  And I got to talk to some people I don't see too much.  Got to juggle with a few people.  Turns out quite a few juggle, including Gavin.  Who knew?
So it wasn't all snobbery. And these guys lent their own funny footnote to the event.   It was all good.

Can an old client accept a segwit transaction?
How does an old client do so if it can't validate the transaction?  HINT: it trusts the miners.  But miners don't get a say if you have no confirmations.

A ton of words that say fewer parties validate SW transactions than current transactions.
Trust the miners?  Really?  Then why not just toss the hard limit? Trust is trust isn't it? Or does it come in good and bad flavors?  Which is good and which is bad?
Then you gloss over the hard fork that would be the only defense of SW users if miners dropped SW validation.
Given your history of decrying hard forks, I find the idea of accepting a hard fork for SW as a defense odd.

Yeah, dang actual facts and logic when you have a view of the world you prefer, eh?
How does one use Bitcoin without bitcoin?  What does it take to get bitcoin?  Is it really an "open system" if you really have to buy in to use?  Most of the "permissioned chains" banks are talking about building also have to use cryptographic proofs of valid contributions; it is the nature of a consensus algorithm. You can segregate access away from the data (that's what Factom does), but the security layer still needs to exist.
Permissioned vs open blockchains is a rather odd point to discuss.  More interesting is public vs private, and if private, if such blockchains have a public witness or not.  Something used to secure the consensus against parties manipulating the past.  POW is what makes such public witnesses possible and secure.  Anchoring can be used to keep a chain "private" yet maintain a public witness.
Not every problem needs a public ledger;  but there are few applications that do not benefit from a public witness.

This isn't accurate.  The benefits are smaller blocks.  How do dissenters not get smaller blocks?  Of course this assumes wallets mostly upgrade.  If they don't, nobody gets SW transactions, and nobody benefits.  
There is an adoption curve for soft forks due to an illusion of compatibility, and risks of attacks that submit invalid transactions that look valid to legacy code. And risks to miners that dont upgrade.  Of course, as always, "hashers" are safe.  But some who think they are miners become little more than hashers.  This is bad for the network too.

Indeed it does.  Sans most consumer products, like their early lead business systems, home computing, game consoles, microprocessors, watches, toys, etc.  They are now largely DSPs and patents.
Bitcoin too could be relegated to some limited set of use cases that avoid the most of the need to support customers and businesses.
If you look at the most successful technology companies, you find people with the skill set Steve Jobs epitomizes:  The ability to connect to the users and the ecosystem around their product.   Bitcoin sometimes feels like the Forth community of the 1980's, where an idealized view of their technology excludes too much of the industry, despite the massive technical advantages at that time.   Idealism relegated Forth to a small set of use cases, which have dissipated over the decades.

How is providing a quote from a thread repeating myself?  And if my call for a lie (that you can't respond to) is repeating myself, okay.  I won't repeat myself if you can provide something to back the claim we have lied.
The token.
The token exists to provide an incentive to the servers that will run the protocol in a distributed autonomous network.  Until then, they are simply a mechanism to limit spam on the protocol.  Zero additional tokens are generated until the federated servers go live.  The funds collected are held by a third party until we pass review on milestones, again by third parties.  At this point 2/3 of the funds are still being held.
If you can tell me how to pay incentives to servers without a token, I'm all ears.  I looked at a complicated multisig series of bonds, but that gets 1) way complex and 2) generates more transactions on Bitcoin (which we can keep very low with our own token).   
But keep in mind that the token is converted to non-tradable entry credits to actually access the protocol.  So you can use Factom as a protocol without ever owning or controlling a tradable token.
Again though, if you want to talk about why we designed the system as we did, we can do so.   And if you can explain how documenting the system in the detail that we have, with the reviews of the papers we solicited, how that amounts to lying, feel free.  I'm interested.

Of course Bitcoin remains secure.
And of course we want nodes to validate signatures.
And of course SW reduces the nodes that can validate signatures.
And of course this doesn't persist over time, as more nodes update to SW.
Why are you sugar coating?  Why not just speak clearly and honestly about what we are doing?  Why try and hide behind the miners and pretend there are not risks to upgrading the protocol?  There are, but they are acceptable.

I think it is safe to say miners and payment processors have quite a bit of Bitcoin, and I have (and I am sure you have) had discussions where they voice a need to handle more transactions sooner rather than later.
What small blocks do is create a fee market.   I'd say a premature fee market.  And if the fees are even a little bit higher, Lightning Networks will be hard if not impossible to deploy.  Certainly it becomes hard to deploy a decentralized one.  After all, you have to pay the fee to setup a channel, and one to break down a channel.  As that fee goes up, customers and merchants will create fewer high value channels, and with partners with higher trust.
At some level (maybe $3 a transaction?) I don't think you have point of sale building channels with customers at all.
So if we think SW and Lighting Networks are the ultimate solution, we shouldn't be pushing a fee market until the LN is valuable enough parties are willing to buy in.  Because that is the other side of this, if buying it gets you the ability to transact, then fees to enter or leave are not that important.  But if there isn't an existing, valuable network, fees become a barrier difficult to scale.  So to speak.
SW has to be deployed *and it has to have significant market penetration* to yield relief from the blocksize limits.  It is unclear when and at what rate SW will do so.

The longer such disagreements go on, the more certain I can be they are liars, right?
Is that pretty much how it works?

But reaching into the dishwasher the other day, a hard fork stuck into my palm and I had to wear a bandaid for a day or two.
A soft fork would have clearly been safer, and since I wouldn't have gotten into a fight with my wife about proper fork orientation (putting forks pointed side up: Bad), it would have been less contentious too.

So nobody but miners need validate signatures, and Bitcoin is just as secure?
Great!   /s
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:32:36
After all, who needs to validate the signatures on unspent transaction outputs if you don't have any confirmations, right?
I really am not saying this is a huge problem.  SW nodes and miners will protect old wallets.  Old wallets will not be as secure in accepting 0 confirmation transactions spending SW outputs because they can't validate SW outputs.
And one of the things about Bitcoin (all code validates transactions) is lost.  Does that matter?  Maybe not.  But there is some reduction in security.  
"By definition" is not an appropriate assumption just because something is a soft fork.  Soft forks can be very dangerous to old software; the only definition is that a soft fork doesn't make a previously invalid transaction or block valid.   It doesn't prevent previously valid transactions or blocks to be invalid.   For example, a miner that doesn't update to SW may include invalid SW transactions.  Now none of the SW miners will build on such blocks, so the miner is harmed.   But Bitcoin doesn't fork, so all is good right?  Well, as long as you are not the miner that loses money.  And you don't care that the hash power they used did absolutely nothing to make Bitcoin more secure.

The cost (risk) of closing a channel is part of the calculation in creating a channel.  If doing so connects one to a large and valuable payment network, then great.  If not, and if one isn't sure about how to extract payments, then why not just take a credit card?  Generally you want a new network to be inexpensive.  Especially in the early days.

Calculating a bitcoin signed message as an answer to a very wierdly worded poll seems to be a very odd way to claim proof of opposition.

An unspent output from a SW address looks like free money to an old client.   Such a transaction spending such an output looks like a legit transaction to an old client, but the old client can't check the validity, because they don't understand the "witness".   Which was my point from the beginning.
Only SW miners and updated SW code can validate properly such unspent outputs.

What.  Impression.  Citation.  Proof.
The semantics here is that **you say there is an impression**.  Yet you can't cite any secondary source that shows this "impression", no source reporting a "contract" was signed.  My search of secondary reporting reflected the content of the article, and the discussion of the article on LTB found no agreement by third parties for this view of an "impression".  I quoted the **opposite** as one reader stated.
What have you proven?  
Nothing at all.  The only article(s) that claim misleading statements from us only repeats Josh and Chris.  The reporter later apologized to me.  I can get that for you of you like.


Proof of a con?  Do we have code?  Is there users of our protocol?  Do we have actual development going on?
If yes to all of the above sans any proof of a con, you have nothing.

The problem with a fee market that stunts LN is that this pretty much forces Bitcoin to the side of the road until a number of currently active use cases die off.  Then the attempt to build Lightning Networks to replace transaction volume is stunted because the players you needed to convert were players depending on the old use cases that have been abandoned.
I really do agree that a premature fee market will result in all sorts of collateral damage in the industry.

Another statement I am not following. "split transactions?"  If you mean submitting two transactions against the same unspent output so that you get two paths, sure.  Yet another path to split the forks.


Oh, quite the opposite.   We just saw a huge spike across all alt coins, with the combined value of the alts beginning to approach Bitcoin's value. Just added them up, and the alts collectively are worth about 760 million vs 5.6 billion.   At the same time, Bitcoin went nowhere.
I believe the path Bitcoin Core is on makes sense only to some small set of people.  Most of it maybe PR, but some is rather convoluted logic that depends on some rather strong assumptions that may in fact not hold.
To be clear, we are all making assumptions here, and it is normal for analysis to vary among even the most intelligent and open minded engineers.


If central to the core's argument is that one should not hard fork, then it is at least a bit relevant.


Not at all.  But running a full node is critical for validating transactions, but the blocksize is irrelevant to a full node.  And if a full node ignores the blocksize, when that changes, such a change is a soft fork to them.   This does NOT increase the risk of any interesting attack.
On the other hand, SW removes the ability of old code to validate transactions.   So I certainly will be upgrading my software.  And this impacts even SPV clients, forcing old code to rely completely on full SW nodes in the network to suppress invalid transactions and miners to keep them out of blocks.
Big fan of SW, but just pointing out that this tit-a-tat risk game with soft forks vs hard forks is useful if for no other reason but to examine closely the risks of anything we do.  No fork is done without any risk to someone.

... For a certain definition of "break," depending upon the soft fork.
The main thing is that the path forward is clear with a soft fork.   That doesn't mean that people will not have to upgrade to make use of Bitcoin going forward.  And depending upon the soft fork, people can proceed and ignore it or just take it on the chin.  For instance, nobody will make you use SW (so you can ignore), but you can't validate SW transactions (so you take that on the chin).
A Hard Fork with total consensus isn't that different from a soft fork, since without mining and a network, old software stalls.  But if you have divided consensus, the two sides could go off in different directions.  Is that a good think?  I don't really think so.  So I'd argue a hard fork is arguably worse for everyone where there exists persistent opposition to the change.

That's your "Outrageous Lies"?
Again, you asked me to defend "Outrageous Lies".  You didn't ask me to defend  an "impression given".
We can discuss the project, why we have a token, what the purpose of the project is, and more.  But this discussion is about "Outrageous Lies".  If they are in new blogs, or pumping of tentative deals, bring up the lies told there.

Oddly, the first stage is the biggest one.  Because the first leg is the hardest to execute to launch the rest.
Of course we COULD try and build payment channels after we increase the cost of setting up and closing channels.   That means an expensive and sparse network of payment channels could try and displace a near universal and less expensive and vast (as you point out) alternative.
To launch, you need momentum, ease of adoption, and often a price break to get people on board.   The current plan for Bitcoin seems to be to stall, raise the costs, and ignore the other parties involved (miners and businesses), and then attempt to establish these other layers.  
To many of us, this feels like trying to go into orbit with an under powered first stage, and hoping to make up for that with the next stage under development while already in flight.
I am working hard (and have been for nearly two years) to layer solutions on top of Bitcoin.  So I get the layered engineering thing totally.   But one can't ignore the needs of a system in flight either.
To be clear, there are many forces centralizing Bitcoin.  But one of the big ones is the price of the token, making mining only reasonable in a few places where power is either cheap or being paid for by someone else.
BTW, I didn't choose the analogy, so not my fault it doesn't support the argument you would like it to.

Here is the reference.  Forgive the caps; it comes from the [source](




A transaction that spends an SW output can absolutely transmit the value to an old address.  If you could not, you would be segmenting the value in Bitcoin, and preventing old wallets from participation in the ecosystem.   And people would be yelling about that.  Because once your Bitcoin was in a SW address, you would never, ever, ever be able to pay someone that doesn't have a SW wallet.

I am not aware of anyone that thinks we can "easily scale on chain" to handle transaction loads at a global scale (what is implied here).
The two sides can be more fairly characterized as one side believes we can resolve near term scaling issues on chain, while we continue to work on better solutions, while the other side believes we should focus on better solutions instead of a simple on chain fix.
The "scientific evidences" suggest we could approach this issue either way, without vast long term differences in outcome.  There are real and present risks that differ (some) between the two approaches.  Both sides have data to support their position that their approach will work.  Mostly, both sides agree on the data (doesn't mean they agree on conclusions from said data, and the risks implied by said data). And it is this fact that has made the argument difficult to resolve.

Where?  What did you take back?  Did I miss something?


Totally agree, and that is why I have spent hours with you, even though if you look at Github, I'm spending every waking hour working.   We have called for careful review of our project at every step.  We have a detailed whitepaper, consensus paper, data structure specification.  We do open source development on Github.
And I am there to discuss this project with anyone that has questions.  Heck, we even host a weekly Bitcoin meetup in Austin TX at the Factom offices every Tuesday evening 7:00pm to whenever, provide beer and pizza, and can be tapped to explain anything to anyone.  We have 10 to 15 people show up per week.  More sometimes.
I also take time to go to the technical conferences.  I run the Texas Bitcoin Conference.  
The point is that this myth of radio silence and lack of transparency on the part of Factom simply doesn't hold up to objective examination.  We hold the same values you are talking about here, and we are doing everything we can to make Bitcoin succeed.  We want to make Bitcoin a core resource not just as a settlement layer, but as a fundamental security layer for data integrity world wide.
That's lofty stuff.  And maybe way, way more ambitious than a land title project in Central America.  But all of this works together, and we are absolutely committed to every project you read about.  Over the next year, most of the partnerships and MOU's are going to fade away to updates on the real projects we are working on.  In other words, our little startup is growing up, and it is getting real.
And I am happy to discuss what we are doing, why we are doing it, how we are doing it, what mistakes we have made, and how we will make things good going forward.  And in no way do I fault anyone for being skeptical of our efforts.  I only would like to focus on objective stuff, and put random hand waving aside.  There are plenty of objective issues that are hard for us to address to waste too much time on absolute trolling.

SPV never checked the blocksize limit.
Even today, very little code needs to check the blocksize limit to validate and verify transactions in blocks.   If any code assumes that miners are never going to contribute their PoW to a block that breaks the size limit (especially since a node really doesn't have to worry about this as a valid attack given the amount of hashing power required to mount one producing bogus big blocks), then raising the blocksize is a soft fork for them.  (Or even no fork at all.  After all, if they are not checking, they don't ever have to check.)  
On the other hand, SW deploys code that LOOKS like the outputs of SW transactions are free for anyone to spend.  Existing code can't validate these transactions.   So in the case of the blocksize, you trust the miners, but there are really good reasons you can, and there isn't any reduction in a existing node to validate transactions.  But with SW, old code simply can't validate the new SW transactions;  they look just like "free money".  You then rely on miners doing their job, not just about how much work they do, but that they do that work properly, i.e. do the actual validation.
This is the problem with calling stuff "hard forks" and "soft forks".   The risks are not perfectly matched to the terms.  There are soft forks that are very, very dangerous.  And their are hard forks that are very, very dangerous.
And some that are just dangerous.  All forks have to be handled carefully.
Lastly, SW is a soft fork to deploy.  BUT if we realized after the fact that there was something really broken about SW, then reversing it would be an utter nightmare.  Not only would removing SW be a Hard Fork (capitals intended), but any SW transaction made prior to the reversal might be at risk.  After all, it is a soft fork because existing clients think anyone can spend the outputs of a SW transaction.   The only reason this is safe is that miners enforce SW transaction validation.  Remove that, and all those funds are no longer secured.
**Edit** I am a SW fan.   I want SW.  I'm just trying to have a rational discussion.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:40:09
No one party gets to change bitcoin's rules.  Not even the core devs.  The problem here is that the argument to increase the blocksize is only controversial with a small set of developers, and goes against the consensus at the scaling Bitcoin Conferences, most vendors, the miners, and most companies building businesses using Bitcoin.
You might be right about merchants not weighing in, but I don't think they generally have an opinion on the topic other than they want their systems to continue to work.
Creating an alternative coin, network, and mining algorithm and calling that Bitcoin isn't likely to convince many merchants to switch over.  They will follow the wallets, which to my knowledge support a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:14:06
Let's suppose only 45 percent of miners take SW.  Then when some invalid SW transactions are mined, then the proof of work would lead most miners to mine blocks with said bad transactions.  The 45 percent would mine a different fork.
That seems like a hard fork to me.
On the other hand, if 45 percent of miners (by pow) do not update, they will accept blocks from the larger network, but (assuming some constant submission of invalid transactions) will not contribute blocks to the main fork.
Again, seems like a hard fork to me, from a mining perspective.
@_date: 2016-03-06 05:37:07
BTW, Bitcoin is a permissioned system.  It uses cryptography and fees to limit access.  All blockchain that I know of are permissioned chains. 
You can get an invitation by buying, begging, stealing, mining, or trading for some Bitcoin.  With that Bitcoin, you can use the protocol.  Without it, you cannot.
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:35:32
I believe that's a great idea.   Of course, it is a hard fork though to really address this issue.   I'm not too sure how they are able to create and use the weighted limit in SW without risking a hard fork (by their own description), but maybe they can?
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:11:31
"Better" is very subjective.   If you mean sooner, easier, more predicable, inline with the consensus of the scaling Bitcoin conferences,  miners, vendors, investors, expectations of the market... Then SW clearly isn't better.
If you mean SW is a soft fork, then yeah.  Okay.
@_date: 2016-01-30 04:40:30
We are getting legitimate full blocks now.  SW will scale slowly, and it is unclear that it will provide room faster than transaction growth.
Of course, if we continue to fight about all of this, maybe we drive the market away into the alt coins?   Then we don't have a problem, because they can take over?
My observation is that LN will be difficult to deploy if fees go over something like 50 cents.   They go nowhere at a dollar.   Can you really say that if the blocks fill up fees won't go up to those levels?  In five to six months?
I can't.  I can't predict Bitcoin prices, and I can't predict markets.  But transaction volume always explodes when the Bitcoin price rises.  There is no room right now for that.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:48:40
Except that the major mining pools have all demonstrated a great deal of patience and openness about the need to avoid slamming into the hard blocksize limit.  They made a clear call for action in December in Hong Kong, and Bitcoin Core came back with "wait four or five months for a gradual easing".  I can understand why they feel they may need to support something sooner rather than later.
The "super majority" begins to build once the trigger is reached, and once the first large block is added to the chain.   In short order, the first large block would prevent the minor and major chains from joining again, and it is unlikely that even a close swing in hash power would matter.  It would have to overcome the weight of the past, and even a small majority builds over time.
Keep in mind that this is a miner war.  Most code doesn't need to check blocksize limits.  An attack building and pushing large blocks that break the limit is very expensive and does little to harm the network.  The validation of transactions is enough for most code to do, and thus raising the limit looks like a soft fork to most code, and what the poster called "Bitcoin" would look like a persistent minor branch, but would lack the PoW to be considered.
@_date: 2016-01-30 04:01:30
I'd point out that your link and everything you are saying totally applies to validating transactions.  I'm behind that, as is all the community, even those that would want a hard fork to 2 MB.
It doesn't so much apply to things like the blocksize.   Here the miners will enforce this rule, and they are really the only ones that can.   If a super majority of the miners up the blocksize, your full node can either drop from the network, or play along.   I have a rather beefy Internet, and bock propagation times are not much of an issue for me.  On the other hand, the great firewall of China will absolutely play a huge role in limiting such block sizes.   Most tests show about 3 MB as being the limit for reasonable peformance at this time.
There are piles of solutions for that on the way.  But my point is that you gave me a link, and it lists a pile of attacks.  It encourages each node to validate transactions.   But nothing it says points to how checking the blocksize is going to make Bitcoin more secure.
And thanks for the welcome to Bitcoin.  The land where lots of strong opinions live close and the holders of said opinions yell loudly :D
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:56:17

The biggest treat to Bitcoin decentralization right now is letting the market run smack into the 1 meg limit.  This will lower the coin price, centralize mining, force many current use cases out of the market, and the protocol will lose credibility that will be difficult to recover.
SW and LN both require a 2 meg block in any and all cases anyway.
Lastly, the 1mb limit SUBJECTS Bitcoin to cheap DOS attacks, if by that you mean transactions back up, the mem pool fills up, and current use cases begin to fail.

None of this is fud any more than fud about the risks to raising the hard limit (which are very small), claims any hard fork create an altcoin, and claims that we have months and months to deal with transaction volumes without risk to the protocol and ecosystem.
The real risks lie in centralization forced by excluding much of the existing ecosystem from the market, and raising fees to force business into tech alternatives that either don't exist or are highly centralized.  Not to mention LN isn't likely deployable against high fees.
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:48:55
The number of opinions approximate closely the number of people arguing.
The subjective arguments include the identification and priority of risks and dangers to Bitcoin:  Centralization, destabilization of the Bitcoin ecosystem,  loss of key use cases in the Bitcoin ecosystem, spam transaction attacks, development of a fee market, etc.
But take centralization.  The sides have difficulty quantifying the issue, i.e. Exactly what are the dangers of centralization, what will cause centralization, how to measure centralization, and what is acceptable centralization.
The same sort of questions can be asked (and argued) about use cases, spam, critical infrastructure, the fee market, and more.
The whole argument is quite complex for something pretty simple, i.e. the need for support for more transactions in the near term, and radical scalability in the long term.
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:40:41
If by "broken" you mean you can validate transactions, then no.  You are broken.
I think SW can break people who are accepting 0 confirmation transactions.   And they would never know about it until it happens, or they get an update.
No change to the protocol is totally safe to everyone.   Of the changes one could put out, upping the blocksize limit is as safe as most any other change.   Most code just shouldn't test the hard limit, because it just doesn't buy most applications any benefit, but exposes them to risk if that number were to change.   And most people (even developers opposed to blocksize changes) don't see a problem with a raise to as much as 3 MB.  And most believe the resistance can't last forever against a blocksize increase at some level.
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:31:06

 utxo_data_size + .25 * witness_data_size &lt;= 1MB

One, that just isn't true.  But if it was, how then could anyone claim nobody is forced to upgrade their clients?   Furthermore, all Bitcoin addresses have to be replaced by SW addresses, as these are the only ones that can accept payments from old addresses and SW addresses.
I can't imagine the core developers signing up for that, and I gave you a quote that pretty much states that isn't the case.

You misunderstand.  There is no benefit of SW if users do not make SW transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:44:13
I can't even parse that.
Old wallets can validate old style transactions, and they can *check the signatures on unspent transaction outputs*.  They *cannot* check the sigatues on unspent SW transaction outputs.
SW wallets will be able to validate old transactions, and validate old style signatures on unspent outputs.  AND they will be able to validate new and improved SW signatures on unspent SW transaction outputs.
All of this is independent of confirmations, though more confirmations assure the wallet the transaction isn't going to change, and that the miners see the transaction as being valid.  See the difference there?  Is this helping at all?
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:06:50
Outputs to SW transactions look like "Anyone can spend" to clients that have not been updated.  Thus a payment using an invalid SW output cannot be validated by old code.   So yeah, there is some impact to old clients by segwit.
Such a transaction needs to be constructed maliciously, but all that is need is to goof up the signature.   If most nodes are updated, it wouldn't be propagated.  Still, if presented to a client prior to being in a block, the client couldn't validate it .  Not interesting most likely, but hey, we worry about these things in this space. 
More interesting would be an attack where miners reverted away from SW.  That would effectively unlock all SW outputs.   That would be bad.  The removal of SW would be a terrible hard fork.  But still, not very likely.
What I want is a chance for Bitcoin to thrive.  I do believe we need stuff like sidechains and LN.   But I think a premature fee market is a great risk to many companies, to Bitcoin, and even will drive centralization.
I've heard Bitcoin's future described as being like Gold, where transactions occur on layers above and beyond Bitcoin.  Okay, I think so too.  But keep in mind, Gold is only kept by a vanishingly small number of parties that we have to trust (and shouldn't trust) to support those layers.   Bitcoin could easily be centralized such that it was controlled by a vanishingly small number of parties as well, while the rest of us never have the fees to do Bitcoin transactions.  We all live at the leaves, with payment channels on sidechains and never touch Bitcoin.
Maybe that can't be avoided, but it shouldn't be promoted either.  Not ahead of its time.

Create a premature fee market, and Lightning Network won't show up.  When you have a chicken and egg problem, you can't charge people premiums to participate.
Putting off the fee market until you really need it, and providing for on chain transactions until you have some other option in place isn't all that stupid.
Centralizing the use cases and driving off adoption isn't promoting decentralization.   Driving the price down through a lack of action on fairly well detailed and defended concerns isn't promoting decentralization.  The size of the blocks isn't the only centralization pressure Bitcoin faces.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:17:43
Not the point.  You need upgraded software to generate SW transactions.  If most people don't update wallets, then SW will do nothing to increase transaction volumes.
Of course SW transactions work (sort of) without an upgrade.  Old software will not validate transactions properly, but as long as miners update, confirmations will be an indication transactions are valid.
SW is a hard fork for miners;  miners must validate transactions properly.
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:15:16
Only the first step in three major steps:
1) deploy SW in Bitcoin core, Bitcoinj, btcd, and all other node implementations.
2) update all wallets, explorers, blockchain parsers, applications.
3) user education and adoption.
We saw the same process years ago we with paper vs electronic airline tickets.  It took years, despite huge, huge usability advantages and cost savings.  
In contrast, a bump to 2mb blocks applies to everyone, and only code that even looks at this limit (most doesn't have to) has to be updated.
@_date: 2016-03-07 00:38:00
I was there, and I know what statements he is referring to.  Were you there?
Gavin acknowledged the value of Libsecp256k1, and SW, and Lightning.
Not much is coming online in the next few months though that do much to provide bandwidth. Lightning is some unknown months and maybe a year or more out.   Further, Lightning may be difficult to launch in a premature fee market.
But you know these things too.  Calling people liars isn't useful.

Of course, if you have any measurable channels settling on the blockchain, the blockchain has to be big enough to handle that load.
You are not going to have so little in the way of settlements to run 50k tps on 1 MB blocks.

I'm not a big fan of 2-4-8.  But I am really not a fan of BIP 000 (as Jeff Garzik labeled the act of doing nothing to quickly and logically address the issue of the blocksize).
And no, I don't think SW is a suitable plan in isolation from any blocksize increase.  I don't think SW provides enough support for transaction volume, and what support it lends will come in too late.   Frankly, I don't want to see an alternative code base alternative to changing the blocksize limit in core.  
What the core development team seems to be willing to do is force the development of a "Fee Market" and drive out a number of business models (like payment processing, meta protocols like counterparty, color coins, etc.) from the market.   That of course will drive down the value of Bitcoin as more voices are added to Mike Hearn's.
Driving down the price of Bitcoin will hurt the miners.   Fewer parties in the ecosystem will drive centralization.  Higher fees will make deploying alternative transaction solutions like Lightning Networks very hard if not impossible.
We have 8 to 12 years where the rewards are sufficient to drive mining and decentralization.   Pushing a fee market at this point is premature and very damaging to the ecosystem.
While you may not appreciate my own efforts, I am doing everything I can to make it possible to build and deploy meta protocols on Bitcoin without using any blockchain space beyond the (almost) 13 Meg per year of anchors used by Factom.   This rate of transactions in Factom has been used to secure over 120,000 entries (meta transactions) in Factom since September of 2015, with nearly no load on the Factom protocol, and just 144 transactions per day in Bitcoin.
I am not involved in forking Bitcoin, and endorse no such project personally. I am building a viable scalable alternative to many of meta protocol use cases, and the approach of Factom is one that "colors inside the lines" with the Bitcoin protocol, and poses no threat to Bitcoin, its users, or the business models that rely on Bitcoin transactions.   That said, I certainly empathise with those that understand the risk of the Bitcoin core roadmap as it currently stands.

His letter and this piece both call for people, particularly core, to talk to people and assure them that core isn't going to let the ecosystem slam into a brick wall.

If there are *enough* dissenters *among miners* then a hard fork cannot be done at all.  SW gives more block space *to everyone* to the extent that *users create SW transactions*.

Which gets back to what I said:  larger LM will, at some rate, require more blockspace, and high fees WILL centralize Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:03:50
Your funds are locked in channels.  Offline channels means you can't access those funds. So people will want to close channels *at some rate*.
Allowing the market to slam into the blocksize limit will hurt Bitcoin, and is unnecessary fo LN.  In fact, room in blocks is necessary to develop LN even if the room is in the end not used.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:16:24
Or if one side of the channel tended to be offline too much.
I tried to get realistic estimates of settlement from the LN folks at the scaling Bitcoin Conference.  Zero isn't realistic.  1% per year?  5% of channels per year? How many channels will a person keep?  Will people reorg?  How often?
With 10 million people using Bitcoin?  With 100 million people using Bitcoin?
All of this implies that SW will need more blockchain space as adoption comes on line.  1 MB would not be enough, at some point.  The question is where that point is.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:24:22
Well, I am not in anyway against SW.  I only disagree with two claims made for SW:
* SW is a soft fork therefore safer than raising the blocksize
* SW will provide support for close to the same transaction volume
I really don't like the binary designation of hard fork vs soft fork.  It doesn't reflect the risks to Bitcoin, nor the damage to participants in the ecosystem.
Deployment of a hard limit increase with a soft limit of 1mb would be a soft fork.  And if combined with SW, all miners would take it.  Because, as you say, a failure to take it would "only" destroy their business model, should someone feed bad SW transactions to the network.
Most software shouldn't be checking the hard limit anyway; while checking transaction validity is really critical, there is little to be gained by checking the blocksize limit.  Spam attacks with too large of blocks with the appropriate pow isn't a realistic attack of the network.
Who knows, but I'd guess that even if significant amounts of software is checking the hard limit, that could be fixed in the process of pushing a 2 MB limit.  Furthermore, nothing prevents people from "upgrading" wallets and Bitcoin nodes now.  The testing is straight forward.
As for delivering support for transaction volume, it won't.  What it will do is deliver a fee market.  And it will do so 8 to 12 years before such a market is needed. And it is doing so abruptly rather than giving the market time to adjust.
And high Bitcoin fees will kill LN.  
If fees go up too high in Bitcoin, then the cost to build channels and break them down becomes too high for small transactions, the target use case for LN. 
For example, a fee of $3 would make it a tough sale to build a channel to "buy coffee."  Sure, a customer might be fine with the 3 dollar fee to put 50 bucks in a channel with Starbucks.  But suppose after buying a few coffees, maybe pushing a payment or two back and forth through the channel, the customer goes off line for a month.
Now Starbucks has, say, 20 bucks in a channel that they can't access without settling.  But settling is going to cost $3.  That's 15%. And it's going to take whatever settling time we finalize on.
So Starbucks will need to charge something to cover settlement costs.  Remember that LN is competing with apple pay, android pay, credit cards, gift cards, and maybe even rewards programs running on Factom (hee!)... Now LN isn't cheaper than any of those.  
Now we have built a significant barrier to LN.
But access to the LN network is valuable you say?  Well only if there is a network effect.  How do you get that?  You need lots of channels.
And high fees build a significant if not insurmountable barrier to lots of channels.
@_date: 2016-01-29 20:29:51
There is no precedent at all for a reorg over months of blocks, and in this case miners have all (at least those that showed up to any Scaling Bitcoin conference) been calling for a raise in the blocksize limit.  Why would they go against their own interests and destroy the network?
The dynamic in Bitcoin selects (pretty quickly) a winner and a loser where there is some significant majority.   Once established, there isn't much going back.
Validating nodes can ONLY detect attacks.  Their only response is to effectively go off line without miner support.  They cannot schedule and order transactions in blocks.   The blocksize then is meaningless to a validating war, outside of devotion to some arbitrary dogma over the mitigation of any real risk to the protocol.

At this point, we at Factom are still running all the Federated Servers.  However, every node running the current Factom software on the network is auditing the transactions going into Factom.   If any transaction didn't follow the rules, any node running our software today would reject that transaction.  It wouldn't pass the transaction along in the network, and it wouldn't accept any block with a bad transaction.
So we currently have auditing in the software.  We do have a third party audit that will be done on the software that determines that it does perform as it was designed to perform:  Audits of transactions, distributed servers, audit servers, and supports a distributed network of nodes that also audit.
All nodes in Factom run the same software.  The difference between our servers running the protocol is that they each have a distributed identity validated in Factom that gives them the right to be a Federated or Audit server.  When we do distribute control, the servers run by others will have their own identities and will control their servers.  These people will be selected by us, initially.  Once we have elections in place, then they will be selected by those using the protocol.   Once elections are in place, then and only then will incentives be paid out to the Federated and Audit servers.

Exactly correct.  But what was said at the second conference in particular was clear support as I described, and not refuted by the developers in attendance.

Alternatively, LN channels will always have an institution or company at one side, one willing to be up, and whose business model justifies tolerating some channels going off line because their customer is off line.
In other words, we can push centralization as the solution to scale Bitcoin.  This is totally valid in my mind, but it points to the danger of centralization in driving up fees.  Just using coinbase to settle works today.  LN could improve such centralized solutions by enabling the forced withdraw of funds should the customer wish to leave.
But if fees make ledger transactions prohibitive, will people begin to use institutions to manage transactions instead?  If fees got to $20 a transaction, nobody would want to do Bitcoin transactions to set up a channel for $200.  Maybe you just get an account, and trust the institution to avoid the fees?
Or you have block growth sufficient to ensure reasonable fees, and allow private channels.

I didn't budge a word outside the documents YOU gave me.  How is that glossing over history?  Quote a lie, or give it up.


We repeated verbatim the article I quoted, along with the hope for a prototype leading to a project. 


Reread the **actual quote in the link you gave me**.  If I had been silent, none of this would matter.  We are the source, nobody else.


You have any proof of that?  I don't know of any fact checking done, and if they had, the obvious first stop would have been us.  Who did we lie to then?  The conversation with junseth was only 3 months after the article, and we were only then becoming aware of delays in the process ourselves.  At the time, we really still were hopeful for a prototype by the end of the year.  Most of the code was already there.  But more importantly was going live with the actual Factom protocol. We were focused on getting the protocol live in September, and this discussion with Junseth was a month earlier, before we could have done anything.
If we wanted to stonewall, we could have just said everything was waiting on the live protocol.  But there was no such calculus going on, because *we do not lie or bend the status of our projects*.


It would have been easier to read the article.  Why don't you?  If there was some statement that it was a done deal, produce it.  You have the link.  I gave you the statement from the article that implies otherwise.

I made quite a number of comments on the article, and engaged other readers.  The author never replied to me once.  I don't think that is a "surprisingly productive discussion between the author and several members of the Factom team."
The only contribution by Lisa in the comments was:






Because Disqus can be tough to read (you can't collapse branches in the conversation) I can't even easily tell who she was talking to.  But she didn't seem to have joined the conversation from a Factom perspective.

If we are at fault for not being more clear, you certainly at fault yourself for misrepresenting what we have and have not said, as well as the actual state of the project with Honduras.  
Or maybe you are just ignorant, because you are taking Josh's word for what is in the article, and what is in the chat.
Dangerous, as Josh has no qualms of distorting what we have said, and misrepresenting the state of our efforts.

I didn't say anything that they should take offense to.  I have worked on projects that required contracts with Texas, Los Angeles, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, and more.   They all seem to roll the same way, with much initial excitement and promises, then delays as the paperwork requires many parties to come together.
Being in government, I'd guess they kinda understand this.  In all the domestic situations, I found most of them are more harsh about it all than just to say "politics being what it is".   I sincerely doubt international governments are so terribly different.

I'm sure those protections can ensure that the banking industry never crashes...
Well, unless it does.
LIBOR anyone?  Credit Default Swap price fixing anyone?  Just those two involve manipulation of markets about 1000 Trillion dollars in size....  Despite regulation.  And no clear reason to believe this manipulation isn't continuing.  And nobody goes to jail.  And no fines levied that ensure the banks involved didn't profit, even at billions of dollars.
I appreciate that Coinsetter intends to stay in the NY market, and that's likely a good move.  Any added compliance costs will be offset by a captive market in NY that can't access services otherwise.  But being a "small pond" market isn't the same as how NY sees itself, a leader in finances in the world.

I worked really hard at eliminating a token from Factom.  The problem is generating incentives for people to run the servers.  If paid Bitcoin, who pays them?  
Bitcoin incentives are Bitcoin, so the protocol can pay out the incentives in Bitcoin.  Factom is the same.  It has a token to pay out incentives via math; nobody has to hold Factoids paid it the servers; they are issued by the protocol, the code, i.e. math.
We also have to charge for access to the protocol to eliminate spam.  Otherwise spam would flood the protocol and make it worthless.   Having our own token allows us to create this cost and isolate the token from the users of the protocol so that users of the protocol do not have to have the token, and thus only those that wish to sell or grant access to the protocol must have factoids.
That's where this confusion about Entry Credits came from.

ad hominem much, there I think staking yourself and your criticisms on a project like Factom on personal attacks doesn't rank high on the "impressive behaviour" scale you seem to seek for us.  When a project has been in open development (including doing business development and presentations) for a year, anyone could cut and paste proof of anything they like.
You are a very intelligent individual.  Factom has provided documentation not only on our vision, but our algorithms, our implementation, and our development.  I think we could have a much more productive conversation if we would talk about the technology more, and less about any misstatement of any person on any forum over the last year.
I would absolutely welcome your analysis, and even have you over to the office for discussions about our technology and our approach.  This isn't the first invitation I have made to you, nor likely the last.  But it is disappointing that you would rather attack people than discuss the technology. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:13:28
I would suggest anyone who cares about the truth to read the chat rather than Josh and his friends continued spamming of misrepresentations of the "conversation."
We are quite open at Factom, and we answer questions asked of us.  Our sin here is an unfortunate article, and our blog post documenting said article.  That said, nothing in the article is literally false, and the project continues.  When we do sign a contract for the pilot, we will announce it as such.
Or talk to us.  Our code is open source, on github in real time.  We are a small team, but we make time for the community hosting a bitcoin meetup every Tuesday in our offices.  So anyone can literally and without an appointment come see where the sausage is made.

Do you think there are more scam Bitcoin companies than traditional ones? (LIBOR, Credit Default Swap price setting, HSBC money laundering, Savings and Loan scandal, Bernie Madoff, World Com, Enron, etc. etc. etc.)
And all of that under the regulations at hand.
Now let's look at Bitcoin:
Ross in Jail.  Shrem convicted.   Crooked Investigators caught.  
200,000 BTC from Mt Gox found by users analyzing the blockchain.
All of that and much more without any particular regulation.   How many bankers went to prison for price setting markets totally something in the order of 800,000 billion dollars per year? (LIBOR+CDS scandles)
And Bitcoin's total market value is what, 3 or 4 billion dollars?  If the ratios held, the "trusted" infrastructure should have put 800,000 bankers and traders in jail.... (4 billion / 1+1+2) (i.e. just counting Ross, Charlie, and the two crooked cops)

Note neither the article nor the post contain the words contract or agreement.  What the article says we have is a "commitment".   The article was intended to prep for an announcement of a signed agreement, which has been delayed.  Unfortunately the article was published early, and contains a number of minor inaccuracies.  
Other than a delay, nothing about the project has changed, and there is every intent on both sides to execute a contract and start a pilot project. 
Note that the article (and the post that echos it) does not say we have a contract, nor does it say we have actually started the pilot project.  Work on this is continuing, but the hurry up and wait of government contract negotiations continues.
We are open with our community and with our investors, [as the 42 pages of conversation posted]( by Joshua Unseth demonstrates despite the continued misstatements and exaggerations of our positions by Josh and his friends, and their hostility.

Users of the protocol can purchase Entry Credits against a public key.  They do not have to purchase or handle a Factoid token.  You get:
* Isolation from cryptocurrency if that is a concern.  A user of Factom can buy Entry Credits from someone (we will be setting up such an option) using Dollars, a credit card, Euros, or whatever.
* Of course, Entry Credits also provide the ability to purchase access to Factom with Bitcoin without touching a Factoid.
* More security for your applications, since the private key for your Entry Credit doesn't allow the transfer of assets from that key;  having no tradable value makes the Entry Credit address a much less interesting target.  So an application that may need to hold an Entry Credit address isn't holding an address with a tradable token attached.
* Allowing a floating exchange rate between Factoids and Entry Credits allows the value of the protocol to lift the value of the Factoids, while maintaining a constant cost for users to use the protocol
* Entry Credit addresses are used to elect the Federated and Audit servers that run the protocol.  So it is closer to a Proof of Use than Proof of Stake.  This means someone could buy up all the Factoids, but unless they actually use the protocol (by converting said Factoids to non-transferable Entry Credits) they have no say in electing the Federated Servers.
There are others, but those are what come quickly to mind.

I absolutely believe gift cards are used to launder and transfer money.

But don't blame gift cards.  Recent scandals point to the fact that all of the major banks are directly and knowingly involved in money laundering... They cannot ignore what can be up to 40 percent of a market.

The Pre Release is a developer build of Factom written in Go.   There is one code base, with the same software that runs as servers and as clients (depending upon their role in the network).
We are looking to bootstrap Factom into existence.  The first Factom Server will be running as a centralized server.   Then we will fold in the consensus algorithm.  Once the network has built up to 32 Federated Servers (responsible for the protocol) and up to 32 Audit Servers (candidates to become Federated Servers, and responsible for double checking the protocol), then the Factoid rewards will begin being issued to the Federated and Audit servers.
Until we have the full protocol with the Federated and Audit servers running, no Factoid rewards are generated.  The network will be running solely on the Factoids issued in the crowd sale, purchased by supporters, and issued to project contributors. 
This Pre Release version represents an engineering build that we will be updating as we move it to the first Release Candidate.  Once we have a tested Release Candidate with no known major issues, Factom will go live.

If you were like Peter Todd who provides huge amounts of analysis to back his views, even as he has often disagreed with me (both in person and on various formums), then I would say your views were backed by logic.  Well, no, you don't do this.

That Bitcoin only links are allowed isn't a new policy, and that Ethereum is not Bitcoin is all a given.
Those of us that consider Bitcoin the Bellwether of Cryptocurrency  will always feel should relax this stance for news and topics that are significant in Cryptocurrency BECAUSE Bitcoin holds this significant position.  No other cryptocurrency holds this place among all the growing Blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.  I believe that those of us that promote Bitcoin as the leader in the technology are better served by forums and conversations that are wider, not more narrow in focus.  (Can get behind "not too wide"... Pictures of kittens and skateboard tricks gone horribly bad have their own homes...)
This hasn't changed either.  Clearly some moderators of r/bitcoin don't understand this view has been and is held by significant numbers of their subscribers.
**An Aside**  *I prefer not to use terms like "alt-coin", "scamcoin",  "s__tcoin", etc. as blanket terms for "cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin". Saying "Ethereum isn't Bitcoin" is both accurate, factual, and easier for newbies.  Saying "Ethereum is an alt-coin" requires an understanding of views of cryptocurrency that are not necessarily obvious. The later requires the reader to understand the view exists that Bitcoin is "the coin" and all else is an alternative, and for the reader to understand that "alt-coin" refers to all cryptocurrency based coins that are not Bitcoin. Never mind the requirements to be considered a "cryptocurrency"*

I can't convert dollars to subscriptions to MSDN without MSDN issuing the subscription.  And I can buy a subscription from MSDN with any sort of currency and payment process, i.e Euros, Dollars, Yen, credit cards, etc.
Factoids support a transaction type that does the conversion directly.  You must use Factoids, because nothing else coverts. You do not have to go to some centralized authority to purchase the subscription, you simply do the conversion, and you can only convert Factoids.
Factoids are much more like an issued coupon that people can pass around until at some point it is exchanged for one of those wrist bands you can't take off without tearing it up.

All depends on your view of "Bitcoin".   Many of us are quite aware of the interconnections between projects in the Bitcoin community, which clearly includes the same people that work on Ethereum.
If Ethereum is successful, large amounts of Bitcoin will be managed with smart contracts running on Ethereum. The funding of Ethereum used Bitcoin.  The people involved in the project are long time Bitcoin people, who will continue to shape the cryptocurrency market  which Bitcoin currently dominates. 
The links between significant projects like Ethereum go deeper, of course,  than just the obvious first and second level ties between Ethereum and Bitcoin.  They extend to most of the cryptocurrencies, since anything done or found to work on a so-called "Alt-Coin" (i.e. not the "One True Coin" Bitcoin) may be applied to Bitcoin.
Even Dogecoin has demonstrated marketing innovations sometimes lacking in Bitcoin.  If Ethereum can make inroads into contracting, and Ripple into Banks and settlement, Counterparty in asset trading and stock trading... then Bitcoin can conceivably follow by the incorporation of successful features implemented in and with these coins and technologies.
Well, it can unless moderators choose to censor these conversations.
I congratulate you for contributing to the moderation of a subreddit.  I would encourage you to see beyond your own bias to the interests of your community.

You know why we do call factoids a software license... They are used to write data into Factom, and that burns them.  A fixed number of factoids are paid to the federated servers for running the system.  They can sell them, again granting the right to use Factom to write data.
Factoids act exactly as a tradable software license. Once converted into Entry Credits, they become a non tradable software license.  Once used to write entries into Factom, they are gone, used up.

In Summary, you haven't demonstrated that I am unstable.  You haven't upset me at all.  I've not ranted at you, insulted you, nor even demanded anything of you at all, other than ask you to back your views with logic.  I have observed in this thread you have not backed your views in this thread with reason or logic. You have simply ranted and insulted, and I can only guess that you are disappointed I didn't respond in kind.  It seemed at times you wished to incite me to do so. 
The discussion here is mostly fun, and hopefully informative to readers.  I am interested in answering concerns and questions, hence our conversation.  You don't have to be a believer, and it is very important for your voice to be heard, and not just you but others that have doubts and concerns.  And I'd rather discuss them openly.
The purchase of Factoids isn't for everyone.  But neither is buying Bitcoin, Dollars, Euros, Gold, Pork Bellies, semiconductors, corn, real estate, cell towers, or any other possible thing someone might buy for one reason or another.  The protocol can't work without the token, so *someone* needs them to make the protocol work, and to provide funds for the servers.

Yes, the analysis is out there.  We put our white paper up, and our consensus algorithm up for review.   All the comments remain available, and surprisingly none of it uses the terms you seem to think are among the generally used terms of the technology.
And certainly, you and I walked through the design of Factom and its incentive model and how it ensures the value of the token is backed by the value of the protocol.

Generally, a gift card lets you buy a range of products and services, and still requires a "sell" step.   Factom doesn't work like that.
However, if your "gift card" relies on a code that lets you unlock a product, like the code that used to come on the back of many Microsoft products, AOL cds back in the day, many video games, many business products and applications, etc.   Where you install your software, use the code, that unlocks the software and registers it with Microsoft, AOL, Game company, IBM, etc... automatically... then yeah.  Factom works just like that.
And oh by the way, people could in many cases buy and sell such products up until someone registered the code.  
Entry Credits work just like that.  Factoids work just like that.
Factoids are easier to trade, and the exchange with Entry Credits floats.  That is the primary difference.  Is that a big enough difference to matter?  I don't think so, and none of our lawyers think so.  Even the regulators in London where we put the foundation gave us the green light.   And we have had many discussions in the US as well, only there remains more uncertainty here.
What is sad is that you know all of this.  We have discussed it in length.  I've offered many times to go in greater detail in person if necessary, as we both live in Austin.  The fact is we are looking to build a scalable Bitcoin based and secured technology that can break through the barriers and solve many real world trust problems in business, government, and beyond.  We are not interested in stealing money from people, but we are interested in making money by providing value to a huge market that has many, many pain points when it comes to trust.

Why you would continue to worry about the existence of an AppCoin in our design, I have no idea.  What I do know is that I have looked at this problem for over a year, and still this is the only solution for deploying a viable  distributed autonomous application.  At least it is the only way that i know of. And best I can tell, it is the only way you know how to do it as well.

Capitalism isn't about being fair.
Technology isn't about being fair.
Heck, when self driving trucks hit, nobody in the NY Financial Institutions is going to care about the hundreds of years people have been driving wagons and trucks for a living.  Those folks will simply be out of a job.
What is fair is fair.  A technology comes to town that doesn't require mountains of auditors to audit and ensure accuracy, and it puts the current guys out on the street?   
That's tough, but whining about suddenly outdated "financial infrastructure" ... "built over hundreds of years" which is now at a disadvantage is pointless.  Adapt to honesty, or get out of the way.

The appcoin drives the protocol, so the appcoin is central to the design.  The crowdsale provided a way to make the initial distribution without pre-mining the coin, and schedule to dominance of the servers over time.

Of course, using Factom isn't really similar to anchoring any other dataset to Bitcoin.   Because Factom is pretty much the minimum protocol necessary to create a Merkle Tree that includes multiple sources of data, and to write the merkle root into Bitcoin.
Building a SQL database for your application and creating hashes you write into Bitcoin doesn't scale.   That may be "similar" because both secure data.  It isn't "similar" at all if you have to have a solution that scales for multiple (even unlimited) parties.




Of course, Factom isn't complete (a point already made), uses a token system rather than accounts to manage write permissions,  and the protocol commits to recording before it knows what it is recording.   So even as a centralized solution, it has safeguards that you wouldn't have in a typical SQL database sort of solution that acted as a recorder.

Not aware of anyone saying SW includes prioritizing SW transactions.  That could push some adoption.  If miners refuse old style transactions, it could even force adoption.
The point of increasing the blocksize is that it could be done quickly and (proponents argue) safely.   Push it to 2 MB, and we would have a year to develop SW without risk of transaction pressure causing issues without regard to the rate of adoption of SW.   
Most of the arguments against SW as the sole means of transaction volume relief are about complexity of implementation, adoption curves, delivery schedule, and its expected transaction volume improvement.  I don't hear any arguments against SW security that do not amount to FUD (with the slight exception of damage to 0 confirmations by non SW clients).
The arguments against a 2 MB hard fork are nearly all FUD, or based in a view of Bitcoin's purpose that is okay with shedding use cases for Bitcoin even if that means breaking existing business models.

Let's suppose that the minor chain persists.   Well, that is called Clams already.   This is absolutely a way to launch yet another altcoin, and to do an initial distribution.
This isn't a major long term threat to Bitcoin.  Maybe a bit confusing, but nothing more.
Running smack into a 1 MB block limit, and the shedding of use cases from Bitcoin arbitrarily is at least as damaging as this scenario you are painting.


Absolutely true.  And the risk with SW is pretty much on par with raising the blocksize to 2 MB.   Heck, even the Core Roadmap acknowledges the eventual need for a hard fork.   How can that be, if all this chaos is a certainty from a hard fork? 
What is certain is that we are about to [smack into the 1MB limit.](  And the roadmap says we have 3 to 6 months before we have to provide even modest relief.
What is really sad is that this was communicated to Core in two Scaling Bitcoin Conferences set up for this very discussion.   And the message was consistent from businesses in the Bitcoin community:  Do something to make room, and absolutely work to solve the problem long term.
All the majority of Core wants to do is the latter.  Many in Core acknowledged his approach likely has the outcome of destroying many of the business models people are working on.  The justification is that ["Bitcoin was never intended to work that way."](  So a few have noticed that if you deploy to miners code that allows a larger limit, we can buy time.   And it doesn't need a Core stamp of approval.  Most of Core even acknowledges this to be true, but fret that it circumvents their role in the process.
Will that hurt Bitcoin long term?   I dunno.  My guess is no.   And even running into the 1 MB limit won't kill Bitcoin long term.  This stuff will resolve itself, but I think we are going to run into a 1 MB tree before we realize blindfolds do not make good governance.

Embedded in your reasoning is a set of priorities referred to cryptically as "the critical properties of Bitcoin".  Why isn't Internet commerce part of this?  Or Merchants?  Does Bitcoin include in its vision the idea of electronic cash?
I think so.  And because of that...
I'd include the ability to log cryptographic transactions.  If not on the blockchain, through some secure mechanism (like LN).
I'd also include protecting the value of the token.  It is why miners mine, and if the value of the token goes away, then all other security that comes from mining and the diversity of supporters goes away.
The construction of alternatives like The Lightning Network requires a low barrier to entry.  The larger the fee, the more expensive to set up and tear down channels, and thus more risky for both parties.  The calculus of this risk depends on the value of the network, which starts out at near zero, and grows with adoption.   I worry that a premature fee market is a danger to alternatives.
I also see the development of a fee market this year rather than a couple years down the road as a large risk.  Bitcoin has not yet won, and the rewards (if the value is protected) are still enough for another 8 to 12 years.   But erode  the value of the token via a premature fee market, and maybe you only get 8 years.   Or maybe only 4.
So at this point, payment processors and merchants and miners and infrastructure folks like wallet companies and meta protocols (for trading assets) do deserve attention.  If you look at what Bitcoin is used for, it is reasonable to think we need to manage current uses until alternatives mature.

Interesting reading, for sure.
Points missed:
* We have full blocks now.  
* Bitcoin transactions are now a zero-sum game; my transaction in a block means someone else's isn't in the block.
* We will stay here for 3 months (until May-ish at least)
* With SW, we will be back into full blocks by October, +/- a month or two.
* The last reward halving double transaction volume in about 4 months.  Not this time.
* We are kicking off a fee market, and nobody knows what that will do.
* Transaction flooding attacks are cheaper now.
I am all for deliberation.   That's why I went to two Scaling Bitcoin Conferences when I didn't have time to attend much of any others.  Yet we are still hearing that "Controversial hard-forks CANNOT Happen".
Well, of course they can.  And what MIGHT make them happen is running blindfolded into a brick wall.

So if we lose 3000 of the current 6000 bitcoin nodes, and all the users that do not in fact mine, then the result is more decentralized?  I think (correct me if I am wrong) you are suggesting that Bitcoin needs no more than 3000 users to be more decentralized than it is today?
I don't think that is the goal of the small block side of this.  If it were, you would have even less support in the ecosystem.
On the other hand, you would have all the room you need in 1 MB blocks via this scenario.   Wouldn't need SW, LN, Bigger blocks, wallet infrastructure on phones, nothing.   Man that would make life simple.

Mining  can enforce policy.  Thats how soft forks work.
Soft limits work as long as most &gt; 51% respect them.  An "attack" in this case is just changing the rule by miners, which they can do anyway.


Maybe I didn't understand how the soft limits were set.  If set as soft forks, we could adjust up or down once the hard limit was pushed up.  Nice observation.
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:57:16


The opposite... We want to keep the 1mb limit to avoid a fee market right now?  I'm pretty sure that wasn't the statement.  I don't know what the opposite statement would be then.


This is also a highly ambiguous statement.  Your "economic" reason could very easily be my "technical" reason.  So I'm not sure what precedent you are talking about.


So I look at "scaling bitcoin" as the problem of how to continue adoption.  You seem to be willing to shed adoption, use cases, via restricted transaction volume distributed (somehow) by wallets that use appropriate fees.


Proud of you for that.  Very principled.  Noting like a firm stand of "I don't care" to holding the high ground.


From day one, Bitcoin was supposed to transition from block rewards to transaction fees.  In the original paper, this is discussed.  What isn't discussed is an abrupt transition to using the fee to allocate space in the block.  [I am referring to the discussion on Incentives, section 6, in the Bitcoin white paper]
What the 1mb block does is fast forward the move from rewards to fees, and not because the incentives are necessary yet, but because it is the only reasonable way to manage a resource limited to 1mb.   Solutions to this limit have been noted for years, the easiest of which (technically) is to raise the blocksize.  Which could have been done a year ago, and only now perhaps we would begin to consider moving past 1mb.  And while being a hard fork, with a year to push updates and tests, we could have been assured of the increase.  
Now we will begin to hit the 1 mb limit as a matter of course.  10 of the last 18 blocks were full as I just looked (at block height 398449).  We are months away from any relief from SW.   
Obviously we can use fees to shed transactions.  But for some number of months, we now have a zero sum game.  Roughly speaking, for every transaction I get in the Bitcoin Blockchain, someone else didn't get one.   As the slack dissipates this becomes more and more literally true.
Of course there is another solution besides fees.   Companies like Bitpay and Coinbase can begin to make deals with the big miners.  This will give their transactions a higher priority, perhaps in return for more predictable income to the miners.  Maybe in return for investment money.  Now the guys processing the payments offline also begin to gain control who gets payments on the blockchain too. And some institutions like Coinbase can manage bitcoin transactions for their users that don't get registered on the blockchain.  
So yeah, I get the idea that economics shouldn't matter to bitcoin, but if you don't like centralization, you should consider other routes to centralization we are building for Bitcoin.  And by "building" I mean the easiest sort of building:  Just sitting on our hands.

Doesn't kick in until you already have 75% of minering hash power.
SPV nodes need do little to nothing.  Full nodes need updated, of course.  If they don't, they'll fork and drown in transactions, with only about a block an hour maybe.
The difference is we are getting full blocks now.  In 4 months it will be a parking lot.  That will drive updates.

Core has its own agenda too, and has largely been tone deaf to the dangers of establishing a premature fee market which can be just as centralizing of Bitcoin as large block sizes.
"Is time to get this over" is the issue.  Core has laid out a plan of 18 months to deliver room for about 4 or 5 months of Bitcoin growth.  Maybe shedding transactions won't be damaging, or maybe it will.  We don't know, but we will find out.

The smartest thing core might have done is deploy an 8 meg block limit, with a soft limit of 2 MB.
While SW is a soft fork, it is irreversible.  Removing SW would be a catastrophic hard fork.  On the other hand, bringing down a hard limit is a soft fork.  Once in place, adjusting soft limits and even lowering a hard limit is easy.  Best to guess higher, and manage the constraints with soft limits, and set the hard limit when you know what you need.
This is still very possible, but not real likely.  The fear of centralization has nutered the discussion, and i dont see some belated discussions bringing a hard limit change about.  
Blocksize is one variable in centralization. A loss of diversity in the ecosystem is also highly centralizing.  At least as much as blocksize, and I'd guess way more so.
So Instead from core we have a plan with no hedge.  If SW and LN don't perform as hoped/expected, or the network grows more than hoped/expected, we have no real options under the roadmap.  
If a fee market explodes and drives away use cases, we don't necessarily get them back later.  LN requires many channels to be viable.  That needs low fees and room in the blockchain. A premature fee market may prove a barrier difficult to scale.
The path we are on with core is one of confidence in the tech and in an understanding of a vast set of variables.  Predicting how this plays out is like predicting the weather.  And maybe as dangerous without a substantial margin of error.  Bumping the max limit gives options that are more flexible than relying solely on SW.  Including dropping the limit to right size blocks in the future.

Factom provides a meta layer where anything currently being done in meta protocols on Bitcoin (like notary services, asset trading, document management, colored coins, etc.) can go at only a fixed cost of 13 MB per year in the Bitcoin blockchain.  No matter how much data, no matter how many users are writing that data.
To scale, really large applications (perhaps like private chains?) can write their anchors into Factom and run their own recording service.  Think of it as Factom on Factom.   
This way we could literally be writing Petabytes of data per year into a network of chains where every single entry in every every chain carries the full cryptographic data security that you would have had if you wrote every single one of trillions of entries directly into Bitcoin itself.
Could the Bitcoin blockchain directly scale to secure Petabytes of data? No.  But Factom, and Factom on Factom is pretty much limitless.
But maybe scaling Bitcoin and applying it to secure the world's data integrity needs is useless?

Just in case you have lost the vision.   Bitcoin cannot provide this experience to 7 billion people with just big blocks.

Let's be realistic.  If Congestion continues for a year, the miners will support a HF to larger blocks.  Blocks are congested now, and SW will not deliever the space required in the time required to do more than provide some breathing room for a couple or three months, at best.  Then it is congestion from then until a HF.
It is pretty realistic to believe that a HF will be done with Core or without Core before the end of the year.
Or those of us that fee a fee market can spiral out of control are all wet, and all will be butterflies and unicorns as "needless" transactions are shed, important use cases are preserved, wallets continue without undue competition from centralized alternatives, and all is good.
The thing is, nobody knows.  But we will find out.  And if the fee market does spiral out of control, and miners insist on a HF sooner than later, we won't get the slow, studied, deliberated, considered solution Core keeps talking about.  We will get a desparate, fast and loose solution deployed quickly, by Core or someone else.

Strange definition of "small" and "big".   Really we are talking about miners with slower or more distant connections to the network vs faster and/or closer.  The size of the hash power (what I would think of as small and big) plays little role in the game, right?
A soft-fork can replace a soft fork;  it depends upon what it is in the soft fork you are reversing, and how you deal with history.   For example, if the hard limit was up at 8 MB, and we deployed a soft fork for miners that they would not build on any block bigger than 2 MB, and everyone else doesn't care, then as long as most miners respect the limit, the 2 MB would be enforced.   Certainly someone could "attack" and build a 3 MB block, and the network would accept it, but as miners build on some other fork, the 3 MB block would be orphaned, and the hash power used to build it forfeited.  Any subsequent soft fork at any size below the hard limit would just work.
I personally see no purpose to the hard limit for blocksize.  Most code can trust the miners on this issue, as they have everything to gain by following a soft limit, and everything to lose by ignoring it.   Even if a group has more than 50% of the mining power, they do not control the value of the token.  And it is that value that makes mining worth doing.   So they, more than any group including Bitcoin Core Developers, have more at stake to follow the rules.
This message, that the miners want very much to follow the rules, was provided loudly and clearly and repeatedly from the miners at the Scaling Bitcoin Conference in Hong Kong.  As well as a call to raise the blocksize to at least 2 MB to get us another year without changes to the economics of the protocol.   This inability for the community to act is (in their view) the primary reason Bitcoin seems to be losing ground as the primary cryptocurrency.

"everyone" in this context really are the set of people working in this ecosystem around payments, infrastructure (like wallets), miners, and meta protocols (Counterparty, Omni, etc.).
Protocols like Factom don't care, as we are trying to build a scalable data layer that does not depend on significant blockchain room.   My opinion is my own (not Factom's) but I believe what is good for Bitcoin is good for everyone in this ecosystem.
I don't run into too many people with public reputations tied to actual projects that oppose a hard fork to at least 2mb.   There are exceptions among core devs who are more "idealistic" than most of the community.  
I do believe core devs are doing what they think is right.  I don't think they have done a great job of listening.  And I don't think they have recognized all the dangers of slamming into the 1 mb limit.

To onboard a user, it takes a few transactions (assuming 2-3 channels per user) x 100,000,000 users / 200,000 transactions per day = 100 to 150 days just to create the channels.  Tearing down requires more, and adding value to channels requires more.
Can you provide your math?
@_date: 2016-02-02 05:04:19
One nit: segmented witness can't deliver on 4x transactions.  1.7 x transactions are more to be expected.
Okay, another nit: Syncing is only faster with less data if you are not validating signatures.  If you want those, you are downloading as much or more than before.
One more: SW will require wallets sending transactions to be updated to get these benefits.  That puts returns on this work out past April, maybe by months.
SW is cool.  But it does reduce security in as much as old nodes can't validate signatures, and miners running old code will not contribute meaningful hash power, assuming some bad SW transactions are submitted.
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:58:29
Citation and methodology?  I only ask because I'd like to look at such spreads.  I'm not aware of any charts that give a spread of transaction median values, sizes of unspent outputs, etc.  I have no reason to doubt you, so let's go with your statement as fact.
If every use case that might generate a small transaction is lost now, do you think they come back with LN?  Why?  If these use cases go away, how does that impact full node counts?  
Regardless of impact of losing all small transactions to Bitcoin adoption and centralization, this is a major change in intent and purpose for Bitcoin. Consider the [first paragraph Satoshi's White paper]( bold added for emphasis:


While I might get behind a definition of spam as being transactions below truly tiny transactions (maybe in the order of a dime or less?), asserting Bitcoin should not be considered for transactions $5 or less is almost certainly a major shift in the vision of Bitcoin many have.  And in conflict with a pretty clear interpretation of the Whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:23:05
Low cost security for person to person (casual) transactions was the use case pushed by Satoshi.  Not really giving up on that.
The Lightning Network will require transactions to build, transactions to tear down, and fees are one of a few barriers to deployment and adoption.  These barriers include regulatory frameworks that allow LN, low fees during launch [keeping barriers to entry low], infrastructure [wallets, payment providers], and user education.
All of this is *improved by continued Bitcoin adoption, low fees, small transactions, and more*.  And here we are creating a fee market when it isn't necessary (even Core admits 3 mb blocks are manageable, at least).  
A fee market will drive investment and companies out of the ecosystem.  Losing "Causal Transactions" will take "Casual users" away as well.   Setting up wallets on phones?  gone.  Sending people their first $1 of Bitcoin?  gone.   All that is spam, right?  And when LN needs healthy wallet companies to adopt?  Payment processors? We will have spent as much as a *year telling people to use credit cards, or Litecoin, or Ethereum for that, right?*  Then what, we ask them to come back and help us with LN?   
What makes you think people are willing to just wait around for the protocol to become (at least by causal appearances) useful again?


I just discussed *how to leverage* this filtering to attack the network.  I know of nothing that filters out the transaction history to ensure a submitted but not confirmed transaction is not none the less added to a block by chance or a (possibly local lull) in transactions
@_date: 2016-02-06 15:17:52
True...  Fees are a threat to LN not SW.  And I'm  not anti either SW nor LN.  But anti fee market for fee market sake.  Got on the wrong set of rails.
To the ~~pount~~ point, SW won't be adopted overnight because of fees.  It won't provide fee relief to that extent.  1/4 fees on signatures is good but not decisive.  And using SW has network not individual advantages, so it is more an application driven adoption model.  If your wallet builds SW transactions, then you use them.
Lastly, SW must be adopted by all (useful) miners.  A majority non SW miners after SW is underway results in a hard fork.  So no.matter the need, care (I.e. time) is needed before going live.
@_date: 2016-02-11 00:57:02
That's pretty chewy.
Sounds like you are saying that the ecosystem of Bitcoin isn't important?  That sheding use cases and usefulness will not reduce validators and security?
I kinda think the opposite.  
What people have in Bitcoin is the digital security of a set of virtual assets.  And it sounds like you are saying is that the access to those assets can be restricted (as it seems to a user) arbitrarily without harm. Further to listen to the concerns of people about these restrictions is socialism?  
Really?  Maybe I just need to chew more, but that hardly follows to me.  As a software guy, I've always thought of listening to the users of a set of software as good business, not socialism.
@_date: 2016-02-28 08:47:15
I don't see how that's true, as I demonstrated.  Today, transactions are taking hours to confirm.  Large transactions, paying high fees even. If the price does not go up, and hash power gets turned off at the halving, blocks could go to 20 minutes for four weeks;  that halves the transaction volume.   That more than erases sw, allowing the mem pool to continue fill up.  Transactions then are not relayed reliably, driving the p,rice down.   If more hashing power is lost... The cycle repeats.  Effectively, in the worst case, the protocol could enter a death spiral.
Basically LN can't effectively launch with a cripled protocol.  And claims that it can without even providing any numbers nor taking into account bitcoin's current need to shed transactions is a waste of time.  100 million on boarded onto Bitcoin as it is today is impossible.
Even 150,000 in a year is unlikely.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:00:04


Heck, we might double our transaction volume, as we did in the 10 previous months.  We are at the limit now, so the pile up isn't in anticipation of replacing VISA.


Well, Ethereum isn't at Bitcoin's volume, so they have growing room.  And they do have a few features to manage their larger blocks.  


Claiming Bitcoin has network effect is premature.  Especially if Bitcoin sheds use cases now just because we let it run into a wall, and Bitcoin becomes very expensive to trade on chain.   Solutions like OT, sidechains, and frankly coinbase all work and have promise, but they are not here yet. *(Well, Coinbase is here, and handles bitcoin transactions between customers off blockchain today.)*  Lightning will be nearly impossible to launch in a distributed fashion if transaction fees go too high (building and tearing down channels become a barrier to deploying the network prior to building network effect and value).   
Claims that Bitcoin wins by default is impressively self assured in a market that we should be considering as competitive. 




Maybe I misunderstood.  I took your comment about ants as meaning small transactions on the blockchain.  Here is what you said:


You were not saying Bitcoin is an anthill, but that those using Bitcoin for small transactions are ants as opposed to "real Bitcoin users."   It was that attitude I called tone deaf.

Again, was this not the point?




Miners mine for value.  Is that so hard to understand?




So.... If nobody mines, and we shed users that we could, but do not want to support... That's what it takes to make the token valuable?
Not sure that follows.

Would point out I have never brought up this complaint, and I don't think I have been talking about complaining of 10 cent fees, though perhaps not ruling them out.


Now back to ants.  Are we all ants?  Or just small transactions are ants?


Which of course is meainingless in the next few years.  Anthills, right?  We are all ants, right?


The creator of BitTorrent is a firm 1 mb now and forever guy.   I sat down and talked to him over breakfast on this topic in Hong Kong.  He, perhaps like you, is hyper focused on blocksize as a centralization risk, while I am way more focused on forcing Bitcoin into a zero sum economy as a centralization risk.
The difference is that I understand and acknowledge that there is a point where blocksize centralizes, but argue it isn't at 2 mb or 3 mb.   Bram Cohen and it seems you are quick to discount the danger of limited transactions driving limited use and limited value and collectively driving centralization via loss of diversity and incentives.
While I point out space keeps the economic model the same, those against avoiding hitting the 1 mb limit feel that the loss of "ants" is no problem at all.


That's all about semiconductors, not storage and not networking.  And none of that is necessary for 2x or even 4x transactions via bigger blocks over the next couple of years.   Which (doing it dumb and fast) gives time to build the other solutions you are counting on without changing the economic model of Bitcoin.
Continually spouting about VISA level transactions is dumb for two reasons:  1) we don't have that problem, and it won't be our problem for years yet, and 2) Nobody is proposing that blocksize increases should be the only way to scale bitcoin.


Even core admits 2 mb and even 4 mb blocks are fine in the short term.


And. This. Is. NOT. What. I. Have. Been. Talking. About.
I have continually talked about the danger of running into the 1 mb wall before any solution is in place (SW or LN or whatever) to take the transaction growth off the blockchain.


"So, we shouldn't have 2mb or 3 mb blocks because VISA."
I wonder if that works for me?  We shouldn't do SW because VISA?  We shouldn't work on LN because VISA?   Blockchain tech is useless because VISA?
IS there any argument one cannot win because VISA?


Actually, only large organizations use cashiers checks.  If by use you mean the infrastructure that makes them valuable.  But even if you are talking about users, of your daily economic foot print, how often do you use cashiers checks?   I've done maybe 2 or 4 in the past 12 months, largely to help my kids out putting down deposits that didn't allow checks.  


Because VISA.  Okay.

There are some scenarios where your (not updated) wallet connects to a node running the minor fork when you think you are on the major fork.   Then you could think you were paid and were not?
Same thing could happen with SW though, where you accept a zero confirmation transaction from a non-SW node, but in fact the SW transaction is invalid and neither the node nor your wallet could tell.
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:09:32
Why exactly?  Quite a few "1%" users are in fact contributing content to the Internet.  That's how uploading data works.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:15:32
The store isn't full.  There is no place to walk, and the waits to checkout are long, but the stuff people are buying isn't important.
Is that about it?  What fascinates me about this argument (it began once the blocks began to fill up) is how perceptive people are.  They can look at a set of transactions and know what are important transactions and what are not.
I'll give you your position, but I'd note that at "normal" transaction growth, we would be at well over 2 mb by the end of the year.  25% of the transactions need to be turned away.  And spam attacks like we had last year become free-ish.
Because transactions in Bitcoin never expire.  So all an attacker has to do is collect all transactions submitted but not placed into a block.  Because the blocks, even if they are not "full" but just "junked", don't fit the transactions submitted to the network, there are plenty to collect.
Nodes are dumping their mempools here and there to prevent crashing.  Our own full node crashed during the spam attack, and [we updated it to limit the mempool.](
Now without spending a dime, the attacker can, as they wish, validate and submit transactions that didn't make it and fit whatever criteria the network sets.   If the min fees rise significantly, that pool can be reduced.  However the process continues to add ammo.
And what do you do if you have submitted a transaction and gave up on it being confirmed?  Once these late transactions start to hit, people will use RBF to endure they secure their Bitcoin.  That's more transactions in many cases, BTW.  Because if I sent a transaction to pay for something, and it didn't work, I might pay some other way.  But I still need a transaction to protect myself from the Bitcoin transaction coming in days later and double paying. That makes this situation worse.  Or they use Child Pays for Parent transactions to "pull" value sent to them out of the mempool.  That's two transactions where only one was intended.  That also makes the situation worse.
And how much will someone pay to secure a dangling transaction?  Well, if they view it as lost if they do nothing, then pretty much whatever fee required to get it to process up to the value of the unspent output(s).  That solves everything, right?
Well, what it does is raise the bar on transactions being submitted, starting the cycle over again.
The point is that once you enter a zero sum game for access to some resource (i.e. I get my transaction at the expense of someone else) and the way you resolve this game is by paying fees, that all sounds great.  Until you realize that everyone submitting transactions becomes committed to playing this game to get whatever value they put into a transaction out of the system.
Now even "junk" transactions of just a dollar or two can play a significant role in driving fees.
Then people go somewhere else.  Adoption stops, and when there is 10 to 20% free space in the blocks again (like October of 2015), the drop in usage, excitement, momentum will impact the price, lower mining power, and the decline begins.  That is the bleakest scenario, but a very, very plausible one.

Meh.   Data transmission costs have fallen and continue to fall.   10 years from now, complaining about 10 TB a month will sound completely silly.
I read somewhere that mobile data (the most expensive on the market) costs providers about 10 cents a Gigabyte.   That's dated, and likely way high.  And that includes deployment and network maintenance costs.  Wire and fiber are 100 to 1000 times cheaper.
Past a monthly fee, there is hardly any justification for charging even heavy users.   If congestion was the issue, charging for high access in high usage periods might make sense.  But none of the providers do that; costs are fixed, even if access is at 4:00 am.

Brian has been speaking out in concern for the health and well being of the Bitcoin protocol.   This is because Coinbase relies on Bitcoin, certainly.  But this is also a matter of principle and integrety.
Selfishly, Brian could just say "Thank you" to Bitcoin Core for filling up all the blocks since Feb 1, forcing more and more users to centralized solutions for Bitcoin transactions like his company, Coinbase.  You can "buy" bitcoin from Coinbase and "sell" bitcoin to Coinbase, and nar a one transaction goes on the blockchain.  You can "send" bitcoin to other coinbase users, and pay no fees.  Again, no transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.
If the congestion continues for months (it will) and fees get higher and transactions less certain (they will), why wouldn't all of us move our Bitcoin from our (now less useful) personal wallets to Coinbase?
But Brian has been speaking out about his concerns for the protocol.   And frankly, Coinbase doesn't need lots of transactions on the blockchain.  So unlike claims repeated about big blocks being happy for big corporations like Coinbase, the opposite is actually true.
Unless you can explain how this is not the case?

My math shows that if we devote the entire blockchain to just on boarding 24/7, it would take four months to get 2 channels per person for 100 million.  SW doesn't add much, and certainly not enough to make up for other uses of the blockchain.
There is no room for maintaining LN in my numbers.  No room for selling out of Bitcoin, no flow.  I'd say your numbers are optimistic by at least a factor of 100.

Nothing forces miners to fill blocks.  And luck can produce a 1 minute block which didn't give the miners time to fill it up (I don't know what algorithm they use to fill blocks that might act that way.)
For example, Block [399366]( was only 208 bytes, but was mined in about a minute and change.
That kind of stuff (empty blocks) can throw a "Percentage counter" way off, and we still have full blocks.
A better algorithm would be to take the set of blocks for a period, sort by size, trim 5 percent off the bottom (since a full block we know is a full block; no need to trim the top), and compute the %full on that.
Anyway you cut it, we are running full now.

I'm interested in how you think this plays out.  We are just bumping the edge now. Still:
We have mostly doubled transaction volume each year for a while.  With that assumption we have a certain number of transactions possible until July 2017, without SW providing a bit more room (1.7x).  That means we need to shed 20% to 50% of transactions by July 2017.
So what is the fee level that sheds 20% to 50% of the (otherwise) transaction volume?

- The minimum channel count should be 2
- Channels can persist a long time
- Tearing down a channel and creating a new one can be performed in the same transaction

Satoshi's vision involved Bitcoin used for "Commerce on the Internet" and accepted by "Merchants" for "small casual transactions".  If those words really mean a store of value, and no use by merchants, and only large settlement payments, then my reading comprehension must really suck.  'Cause that isn't what I get from that paragraph.
I completely accept that we may need to abandon Satoshi's vision due to the practical issues of scaling Bitcoin to a world wide payment system.  However, if decisions are being made based on protecting "Bitcoin's key features," it is pretty important to understand why the set of key features you think Bitcoin has might be different from mine and others in the ecosystem.
Some of us still believe Bitcoin (with the capital B) is a payment system, and the token bitcoin (with the lowercase b) is a means to this purpose.  And I think it is safe to say the big block camp believes (if the ecosystem gets the time it needs) Bitcoin can transition to faster and easier mechanisms to make cryptographic payments and scale.   
The danger of Bitcoin core's roadmap is that it locks us into a very limited solution that doesn't have a hedge on the bet they are making.   Raising the blocksize limit now is the best hedge.
And while reversing SW later would be a epic disaster of a hard fork, reversing a raise of the blocksize limit would be a soft fork.  Which means just because we take the risk of raising the hard limit doesn't mean we are locked into that limt;  Bringing it back down is always an option.
For these and many other reasons (including the politics and the damage to the reputation of the protocol), the Bitcoin core team *should have* worked with Gavin and done at minimum a 2 MB raise.   I actually think Gavin's suggestion of an 8 MB raise would have been safer, with a soft limit at 2 MB, but that is just me.  Because that gives the most options, including bringing the hard limit back down to the needed number once we know what LN and SW provide and that new paradigm, if when it comes about, needs.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:25:04


So why isn't this important when core wishes to do a hard fork?  Only when the community asks for it?  And why didn't they act months if not years ago when such a change wouldn't have been noticed for a long period?
All blocks are effectively now full and have been for a month or so.  We will get a bump with SW somewhere around May, 3 months from now.   That may or may not give us some room.  In the mean time, for very little money, anyone can repeat the spam attacks and block out transactions more easily today than ever.


Other than Bitcoin Core, what other "powers-that-be" are there?  And if all they have to do is sit on their hands to get their way, why would you think nobody worries about that?


Absolutely.  And what I would contend is that the blocksize should be adjustable via soft forks in the future, and we shouldn't have a critical parameter that can't be adjusted without such a brawl, and where the decision making power of the argument is concentrated in the hands of a very, very few.
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:30:24


This is a rather interesting take on the current situation when, I am pretty sure, not everyone (*cough* Gavin *cough* Jeff *cough others) have not agreed.  Even the Chinese miners take on this last round table came with caveats that Core actually follow through with more transaction support (via a HF) or they will pull SW.
I don't consider myself completely ignorant, and I have huge reservations about the "advise" of the "more educated" when those people have no stake in the ecosystem.


My guess?  LN needs to be vetted for legality as regards to MSB and MTB regulations.  I don't see how it can pass for a large, visible company, finanical company in the US.   And you are comparing LN development  to installing and testing some software.  Not the same level of commitment.


This isn't really an issue for Coinbase.  If the fees become significant, they can simply charge the fee to the user.  That's an additional reason for people to keep their bitcoin with Coinbase.  But the fact is they can avoid the fees by building up agreements with other payment processors, and do a better job for the regulators (bank to bank as it were), lower costs (off blockchain settlement), and make more money (fees they do charge they can keep, not pay to miners).


Those developers are just as quick (as even you are demonstrating) that they believe they know more about what is good for Coinbase and payment processors in general, miners, wallet companies, exchanges, and Merchants  then they do.  I went to the Scaling Bitcoin Conferences, and the messages from these groups was clear:  Make room for transactions, and avoid a premature fee market.
Core didn't do this.  Because they know better.   But maybe they were not childish, since they didn't say much at all, but just did what they wanted to do anyway?

A number of big fallacies here.
* VISA does NOT clear transactions faster than Bitcoin.  Far from it.  [Here is roughly how credit cards work](  The heavy lifting is still done via batch processing (like we did in the 60's, when Credit Cards came into their own).
* VISA is a distributed collection of individual processing parties, each of which certainly still puts Bitcoin to shame on transaction volume and speed, but the difference is many orders of magnitude less than described here.
* And no, they don't have a simple consensus model.  The link I provided VASTLY simplifies the actual flow.  There are things like the Merchant's bank, point of sale systems, and payment networks (that let you use your VISA in Hong Kong) that are all missing.
* VISA doesn't have to worry about double spends, because you are taking on debt, not paying value.  So if you pay twice, you get charged twice, NP.   So all they need is to do a rough estimate and then they can take days (or even months) to figure out the real story.
*  The goal of most of us calling for larger blocks is to avoid a hard limit causing clear and immediate damage to Bitcoin.  Nobody, not even one person I know, thinks that we can raise the blocksize and take on VISA toe to toe.  
* Changing Bitcoin to a zero sum game (where you getting your transaction into a block means someone else did not) carries real risks, *which trotting out VISA utterly ignores*.
What might a year of restricted Bitcoin Transactions do to Bitcoin?
* Centralize Payment Processing.  Because off-chain transactions can be performed without Bitcoin fees, companies like BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin, Circle, and others are well positioned to become centralized payment processors who collect the fees and transfer Bitcoin on the books instead of on the Blockchain.  I thought, in this space, we wanted to move away from Banks and trusted third parties.
* Loss of the Bitcoin "Entry Drug", the small casual Internet transaction without a trusted third party described by Satoshi in the first paragraph of the Bitcoin whitepaper.  You know, the one entitled, [Bitcoin: 
A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System ](
* Loss of Bitcoin value to other cryptocurrency options without such limitations (at least not in the next year or two) that can capitalize on high Bitcoin transaction fees (or the fear of such fees).
* With loss of Bitcoin value, we could have loss of security.  Fewer full nodes, less mining power. More centralized mining power (as cheap power is no longer enough to mine; one may need power approaching free, at least until the mining power drops away).
* The scaling plan just discussed from the RT in HK would pretty much require shedding 20 to 50 percent of projected Bitcoin transaction growth between now and July 2017.   Does anyone know exactly what fee level makes that many people turn away from Bitcoin?  I've heard talk that we don't care about "ants", or that we don't need use cases that depend on small transactions.  Do we think that's 20 to 50 percent of transaction volume?
* Lighting Networks will save us!  Beside the fact that you should *never depend* on code that will be here *very soon now*, Lighting Networks require Bitcoin Transactions, and high fees will hinder the deployment.  It is also unclear if Lighting Networks can work with business in the Western world due to regulations on transferring funds between parties.
I could go on.  But the point is that this debate is not helped by crying VISA when people talk about the hard limit.
**Edit:** Before anyone thinks I am picking on LN for their delivery schedule, I've been the developer (and am the developer) who finds himself saying his code will be ready "very soon now".  It is the nature of developers, code, testing, and shifting specifications.

Because reductions in economic diversity doesnt drive centralization?  Not as far as I can tell.  Here is what people have been saying for years:
[Miners, businesses, and privacy-conscious users rely on particular behavior from the full nodes they use, so they will often run their own full nodes and take special safety precautions. This document does not cover those precautions—it only describes running a full node to help support the Bitcoin network in general.](
Doesn't eliminating the whole payment in Bitcoin model going away eliminate much of why some people run full nodes?  Or have we just been wrong for years and haven't updated our pitch?

I'm always impressed by people who are willing to watch some tragic turn of events befall others while comforting themselves that this is just the way it is.
I see quite a bit of danger in running smack into the 1 MB limit.  Maybe we are okay.   Maybe Bitcoin is replaced by some other blockchain.  
Maybe the businesses and miners get together and build a centralized solution that uses central databases for btc transactions prioritized over everyone else, while doing the small stuff with offline accounting.  Kind of a Bretton Woods where big players get blockchain access, but the rest of us have to trust.
Oh but never mind. That's economics.  That's solved by a "not my problem" field.


That's why I'm sitting at your feet.


SW isn't such software.  Like most other softforks, it lends some risk to nonadopters, and massive risk if adoption is reversed.
A blocksize increase could be done as a soft fork.  But this would be very ugly code.

Miners do not transmit value from one party to another.  FinCEN's attempt to claim miners were money transmitters never did make sense.   They "create" money by satisfying the protocol, hence the "mining" term.
A node in a route (not the end points) on a LN must facilitate a transaction with two parties.   Generally speaking, issues arise when facilitating transactions between other parties.

You don't understand Factom and what we are doing.  We put 144 transactions into Bitcoin per day (one every 10 minutes).  With those "anchors" we secure all the entries placed into Factom in each 10 minute period.  
The idea is to create a place where meta protocols that need Bitcoin's security, but not its transaction validation functions can place their records without using up the block with non Bitcoin transactions.
Factom itself when fully deployed will be a distributed autonomous protocol that just records and organizes data.  Even if Bitcoin went up to $1 a transaction, it would only cost $144 a day for Factom to record its transactions.   Assuming the protocol is successful and it has many users, securing gigabytes of data per day would be affordable.
On the other hand, merchants, payment processors, wallet companies, and more depend on Bitcoin as a payment platform.   Driving a fee market prematurely and arbitrarily may very well damage the ecosystem.

Because Bitcoin was never meant to support inexpensive, causal small transactions, right?  The idea that Merchants would care about Bitcoin was never part of the vision.  This is about censorship and the ability to exchange Bitcoin among a few miners and tech types.  Commerce came later, maybe after that guy sold a couple pizzas.  It was a shock to everyone that someone might be able to buy product over the Internet.  That just wasn't  expected.

A point I made elsewhere.  On self interest alone, Brian should *support small blocks*, not argue for large blocks.
After all, Coinbase can provide transactions to coinbase users that are zero-confirmation safe, for small amounts, for no fees, even if Bitcoin's fees go through the roof.
I'm in the same boat with Factom.  We provide a safe place for meta protocols with low fees and cryptographic proofs tied to Bitcoin.  The harder it is to put transactions into Bitcoin, the more attractive our protocol is to piles of use cases.   
However I, like Brian, am concerned about the damage to the protocol that the absolute congestion of blocks *is currently having* on Bitcoin.

Regardless of what number you "pull from the sky," it isn't zero.  If that is eating away from an allowed 5%, then blocking only takes the difference.

No doubt.   But businesses can easily accept Bitcoin from the bitcoin network.  To build a payment system, transactions need to move off the blockchain.  Of course, making transactions over Tor is fine, but not reasonable for legal commerce.

I notice that you are not saying Jeff is wrong or has the wrong facts.  Just that he is ridiculous.  How is that productive?
A certain percentage of any population will just continue forward without regard to updates.  IE 8 was released in 2009.  [7.9 percent of browsers still run IE 8.](
95% as the line for a hard fork is the same as saying no hard fork.  75% is more reasonable, maybe 80% or 85% .   But really any more is pretty much the same as saying no upgrade ever.
Jeff's timeline of 3 months might have been workable starting in December.   But we will hit the wall, and we will have to act faster, or shed users, use cases, mind share, focus, and ultimately value.   Enough to tank Bitcoin?  Not too likely, but it might launch Ethereum to the moon. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 04:20:03


Not what hard fork/ soft fork means.  Hardfork means miners using the old rules can't accept the new blocks, so you end up with two chains secured by PoW without any resolution.   A soft fork means there is only one valid chain.  In the case of SW, miners that don't update their software none the less accept the chain by SW miners.  *This does not mean they can mine successfully, since they cannot validate SW transactions, or properly add SW transactions into the blocks they are mining*.   Likewise clients that do not update are not confused about the ledger.  *This does not mean they can submit transactions successfully*.  That can be taken away, and you still have a soft fork, because there is no confusion about the valid chain of blocks.
Once blocks have been mined with SW transactions, reversing SW out of Bitcoin would require a hard fork of the worst kind.  That is because the new non-SW blocks would allow any transaction to spend any SW output.  AND even one such transaction would prevent SW miners from mining on such a block.  Thus SW requires a super majority, and can never lose a majority.


Moving to 2 MB only requires a super majority of the miners.  If nobody mines with old software (and for months there will be no reason to do so) then all is secure.   SPV wallets would either 1) get transactions because they connect to appropriate nodes, or they 2) pretty much get nothing.  Because they are on the old chain, no mining means nothing happens.
A very small change to SPV (are you a major branch node) is all they need to avoid that problem.  They were never looking at blocksize to begin with.
It takes an overhaul of transaction validation and scripting to support SW and to submit SW transactions.   A much bigger update to wallets.


Counterparty encodes information into the blockchain to trade assets over Bitcoin.  Meta protocols would likely require channels to be dedicated Channels.   A Counterparty channel would not be useful for Bitcoin or colored coins.  
The real answer for meta protocols is to use Factom (my own project).  We put in 13 Meg of transactions per year, and have unlimited space for such meta protocols.  Of course, this is why we exist.


Generally you can't move bitcoins and colored coins independently.  Counterparty has the same sort of problem.  And you certainly can't route these meta protocols over LN channels that are not aware of the colors/counterparty protocols.


Okay.  Didn't say that.  But I did say you need infrastructure and adoption.


Let's say it takes $.50 to put a transaction into Bitcoin.  Someone opens a channel and sends you $3.50 for a coffee.  Then they pretty much walk away.  You are unable to push your 3.50 through their channel to pay anyone else.  Now closing the channel is going to cost you .50.   That almost 15% and its going to take 3 days.
Now imagine the same idea but a $5 transaction fee.
Certainly you will want to do this if the network is valuable.   Maybe you force the customer to pony up a fee to establish a channel to begin with.   That means the customer now is paying a premium to use this service.  But as far as a direct payment is concerned, that's great.  But without a network, that is all they get.  Again, maybe if the network is valuable.  
But LN will not be valuable in 2016.  Connections take time.


LN only exists once the channles are established.


Thanks for the conversation.   Understand that I am a believer in LN and SW.  But I am also very realistic (maybe pragmatic?  Maybe conservative?) about how fast and how much these technologies are going to help when we are already at the transaction limit.

I'd be careful about words like "never" and "can't happen" when it comes to tech.  After all, I spent hours reading about the Cray I, the first super computer with wires carefully measured to bring signals to the right place at the right time at the speed of light!
Now that system has about 1/2 the power and throughput of the phone I bought online.
The blockchain cannot be the basis for world transactions.  Everyone understands that already.  The blocksize debate *was never about the idea that we can scale blocksize and be a world wide payment system*.
The debate is how we can not damage the ecosystem over the next year to two years as alternatives come on line.

Didn't bring up who I know to make an argument, except as a counter point to your, well, paranoia about the aims and motivations of some projects in this space.   In the context of your statement, "...they want to kill the parent project by taking over its blockchain," I think the fact that I know a number of these people trumps your blind assertion of motives without (I am guessing) any direct knowledge.
I'd be happy to share what I know.  But you seem to have arrived at conclusions without the need to go through discovery, reasoning, and discussion.  What would knowledge do to change anything?


The reason many meta protocols for asset trading and smart contracts are being encoded into the Bitcoin Blockchain is for the security of its ledger.   I am working on tech, Factom, that provides that security for a fixed overhead on Bitcoin, less than 13 MB per year.
So no, Altcoins don't necessarily need their own blockchain.  But there are ways to provide Bitcoin's security and not compete for transaction space on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

Sure.  The minor fork goes to zero value very fast.  That isn't the same as "losing" Bitcoin, and it is no different from any hard fork, even one deployed in July of 2016 and activated in July of 2017 or later by Core.
Not supporting classic myself, but the reality of the ecosystem may drive us down that path, or one like it.  Or we follow a very long, expensive, limited, and risky but ideologically pure road as Core has mapped for us.  Which I'd claim isn't in the end safer for us holding value in btc.
@_date: 2016-02-14 06:57:48
We have never hit the max limit before as a matter of normal transactions.  There isn't a rule that can decide a fee structure for a limited resource that doesn't depend on pricing out some users from the resource.
So while some have advocated not changing the economic model, those that advocate driving into the 1 MB limit promote a view it is time to fundamentally change Bitcoin now.  Rather than wait for reward halving to do this (which might take 8 to 12 years).
Eventually transactions will have to cover the cost of the network.  But to insist the time is now rather than allow halving to do this is a change to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:11:54




Well, I'm guessing you are not worried about casual transactions.  For some, that's... Wait, not our problem, amiright?




Good centralization.


 Fail to see this scenario. A small block limit, means anyone can run a node, and host their own keys.   The idea that Bitcoin transactions will rise to  some absurd unit where only the rich can cover the fees is ridiculous since the network will never pay for that level of security.
Yeah, mining power will fall so the 6 billion in Bitcoin today will no longer be secure?  Or you mean we can't have $1000 Bitcoin?


The assumption here is that the space shows up eventually.  And that is not necessarily true for your fee level, and maybe (in the future) not at any fee level if miner institution structures dominate.  In that case, you need fee + priority.  After all, large centralized payment processors only need to settle.  That's more important, and slashes blockchain space required.  
Isn't a zero sum game fun?


Not with diversity.  Shed enough use cases then dynasties are way less far fetched.
Or the protocol dies back and something else takes over.  Admittedly, this is what I really expect.   
Well, until miners revolt should the value be a real and present danger.  Then we will get a solution fast and risky.  Because money, jobs, and investment by miners is at ris...  Wait sorry, again, not our problem, right?


Errors parsing that statement.  I was talking about centralized solutions replacing blockchain decentralized solutions because of fee press... Wait.  Not our problem.


Doesn't matter its how these network evolve. Look at other protocols evolve and they use extension, but they always work to maintain forward compatibility it is the nature of working with decentralized networks.  This is not some centralized rule its just a reality.


Don't think I asked for one.  Talking about your arguments that nothing is wrong, nothing bad will happen (to anyone we care about), that Bitcoin was designed to smash into a hard limit.

Very good link that I was not aware of.  Read through the sections about legality and money laundering.
I am not sure I follow how being "software" makes LN an exception to the legal reasoning in your source.   After all, you are transmitting value from one person to another person, and are settling up separately.  The difference is that a Hawala network requires trust between Hawaladars, while LN has bitcoin (you only risk the delay of closing the channel should the other party become uncooperative or attempt to steal the funds in the channel.)

Because people will pay huge premiums in fees to build channels that lock up funds in a network that doesn't yet have any utility because it doesn't have yet any network effect going for it?  
Rather than use credit cards that are at this point cheaper?  And in a payment network that already does have the network effect?
Lightning networks must gain network effects via low barriers to entry before LN has the value people will want to access enough to lock funds into channels that require significant fees to open and to tear down.

Limited Resources are likely the most common reason zero-sum games exist.
You can't say it isn't a zero sum game, and turn around and say price discovery will determine the allocation of limited resources.  Like saying it isn't dark, we just don't have any light.
Price discovery in some economic models isn't a zero sum game.  That is because the price going up can spur a supply increase.   In this case, the price discovery is playing no role whatsoever in determining supply.  Developers play no interesting role mining (producing "supply").  As such this is more like a "managed" economy, where the decision to raise or not raise the blocksize limit is being determined on technical considerations (at best) and ideological reasons (at worse) without regard to a supply and demand curve.

Let's try and help:


The "utility" in this case is a transaction in a block.  If the blocks are full (they are) and the mempool is pretty full (it is) then we get into a place where one transaction in the block means another does not go into the block.
As you say, a fee can lower demand, because getting into a block isn't equally valued by every participant.  But you are not refuting that we have entered a zero sum game;  you are simply describing how the game is resolved.  Almost every zero sum game resolves into a loser and a winner over some criteria or rule; nothing says it cannot be the price of the limited resource.
A better question for you.  Say we would have have been filling 1.2 Meg blocks in a month or two without the block limit.  But we do have it for the next two to four months.  That means we need to some how turn away 20% of those that either attempt or would have attempted to put a transaction into Bitcoin.  What is the fee rate that separates the 80% that get to have transactions from the 20% that don't?


I have no idea what you mean here.  what is an "organization of usage"?  What is the "system"?  What does "profitable" mean in this context?


Three problems.  LN doesn't exist yet.  And LN can't launch to handle causal transactions if the fee is too high.  And it is unclear if LN is even legal in the US under Money Service Business and Money Transmitter Business regulations.

With core planning a future hard fork.  Let's be clear.


Well, that's not true.  How many people can resist RBF?  Or SW?


Bitcoin is a tiny bit more complicated and functions way differently than any of the protocols mentioned.  After all, when have you last made a payment with your IPv4 wallet?


I believe the 75% triggers the countdown, and then you switch.  By the end, 90 or 95 percent should be on board.


So we are just like simple protocols, but not complicated platforms?
I would add that I never called Jeff ridiculous, the idea of the veto meme that is floating around is, and in fact have supported his BIP 102 proposal with the feedback that it use 95% and a longer adoption period.
Fair enough.  But you did just claim an idea ridiculous without a reasoned argument.  That is what I had intended to point out, but did poorly.
If 75% of mining hard forked Bitcoin, the minor fork would struggle and likely die. Per Gavin's blog.  At 85%, the struggle would be far, far worse for the minor chain.  So I can get you really don't like how the algorithm works, but reality is often unkind to our wishes.
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:06:31


Not absolutely true.  In some areas, you may have congestion.  But fiber can carry absolutely huge amounts of data;  I am not aware of normal or even unusual traffic swamping the backbones.
I am aware of FUD by companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast.  See 




I'm old enough to remember day rates, night rates, and weekend rates for phone calls.   The idea that simple is a justification is bogus. You do not need to charge people way more than you have to just because it makes billing simple.  If it were the other way (cheaper for the consumer) they wouldn't do it.

The reality of halving the reward to miners in late June, and relying on SW and LN only for greater transaction support through July of 2017.

So 3000 is better than 6000 (and a mass migration to China, given they do more mining than any other single country) will increase the number of people who "need to have knocks on their door to shut down bitcoin?"
I think you are making the argument for my side of this.  Clearly fewer participants, fewer full nodes, less transactions, less value, ... all that means fewer people to "knock" to end the experiment.
I exactly agree with your quote, and furthermore would say greater diversity and application of Bitcoin into more sectors and more business processes not only makes identifying and stopping people from running the network hard, it makes it harder politically to even launch such an effort.
When I went to the Department of Justice's Digital Currency conference (held at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco), there was NO talk about stopping Bitcoin.  The discussion from FinCin was how this was going to change things, not how to preserve the status quo.  The FBI kept piping up saying AML and KYC hurts their investigations, not helps them.  Homeland Security talked about how this is rotten for terrorists. The IRS kept stepping up saying Mixers were good and useful.  The entire room didn't argue one bit when I stood up and pointed out that the current financial system is the largest most effective "mixer" in the world today.  They laughed but had to agree, and I heard at least a couple people repeat the observation.
I could go on, but this is because of the diversity of the ecosystem.  It isn't because Bitcoin can be relegated to a few geeks running nodes in their basement to the exclusion of the rest of the ecosystem that has built up in the five years I have been in this space.
Just an observation.

For software responsible for securing 6 billion dollars of assets, I think any way you slice it the development teams we have are tiny.  The corporate financial backing is tiny.   
It seems you lack some perspective.

1. Introduction
**Commerce on the Internet** has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,** and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. **These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.**


I'm hugely long on Bitcoin too.  I'm not doubting your motives, but simply discussing our mutual obsession.  I'm doing what I can to move meta protocols off the blockchain.  So I live this stuff as well.

CANNOT is false.  "Should not" would be accurate in that this does represent the opinion of the presenters. 
If all the miners ignored core, and started mining larger blocks, nobody would lose any funds, and everything would quickly fall in line.  And even if everyone else didn't like it, Bitcoin would continue with larger blocks.   In reality though, it is a very small minority that doesn't want larger blocks.  Because the pressure is so great (and perhaps only because of that pressure) we now find the plan for a "safe" hard fork discussed.

Point is that Brian's actions are in *contrast* to this vision of a centralized set of services.
However, congested blocks push us in that direction.  This is something those arguing that a "fee market solves congestion" ignore.  There are forces towards centralization inherent in small blocks too.

To me, I feel like I am in a car with a teenager who is tailgating at 70 mph in fog.
No, we don't have a $5.00 fee backlog.  Yes, we have been fine for years..  Yes, we could continue to be fine.  But neither of us know this to be true for Feb, March, April, and May.  And if we get into a pile up, neither of us know how it will resolve.




Solved for now? Ethereum is leading.  But quite a few, like Dash, have interesting features that give them a current advantage, and could deploy SW and LN too, perhaps better and faster than Bitcoin core could in Bitcoin.




Yet this is in effect your claim when you keep touting a current fee backlog without regard to what could develop in weeks.
And your dismissal of ants is totally tone deaf.  And maybe the biggest difference between us.  Because I have been working on Factom to provide a scalable solution for asset trading, contracts, proof of existence and versioning, identity, etc. using Bitcoin proof of work, that doesn't use proportional blockchain resources, that doesn't do its accounting on the blockchain.  I could totally be in the "we have a solution" camp.  But realistically, I think my tech is months out too.




That's silly.  We are seeing nodes decline without larger blocks.  Whole cities are getting Google fiber.  We have solutions we could implement that could scale better over existing connections.  
Why do you worry about running into a train when it is the tailgating in traffic that is the obvious risk?  




No, they are annoying because the software provides almost no feedback, is hard to install, takes way longer to sync than it should, and doesn't provide easy mechanisms to let the user manage the resources it does use.  The "Big blocks" that matter most is 6 years of history.

A business that accepts payments on a channel can hardly deny they are participating as one side of a particular channel.  Then imagine that some terrorist money gets routed across said channel.
Of course, Money Transmission really isn't about effective limits on transactions.  If it was, we wouldn't have a thriving drug trade in the US and the world.  But it is the cover story for the regulations.
@_date: 2016-02-06 14:40:05
Because nothing says decentralization like sheding use cases and utility, eh?
Factom is at the very least providing a place for meta protocols to go and still be secured by bitcoin's proof of work.  And a large part of the motivation driving Factom's design and implementation was the limited blocksize.  After all, I think as long as you have deployed tech that supports a given use case, all is well.  What I question is shedding use cases without an existing option just because it isn't your use case.
You could make the argument that Factom benefits from small blocks, as it is a solution for many applications writing directly into the blockchain.  Maybe.  But I think diversity is better long term.
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:38:11


They are not the only opposition, and the track record of being right isn't solely found with the developers we call Core.  I myself have designed, written, and deployed software that is at the core of huge systems authorizing billions of dollars of payments (Eligibility Determination in a couple of states).   I'm no cryptographer, true enough.  But the issues really at the core of this discussion are not cryptography centric; there are no arguments I am aware of about the cryptography here.
Your comments about LN are difficult to parse.  The real value of LN is in routing payments across the network, not just between two nodes you manage.
Your discussion about Coinbase fees is also silly.  If their advantage now is 5 to 10 cents, and fees go up to 10 or 20 cents, they certainly get the head room for free transactions between customers, and 5 to 10 cents (cheaper, see?) when going out of network.  So you quit them because... you have to pay a fee?   What does this say about Bitcoin in general, and this launching of a fee market that Core is committed to for the next 18 months?
I'll not bother talking about LN and Coinbase.   I'm certain they would support LN if it becomes real, and even help  it to become real if possible.
The comments about throwing data at Bitcoin is interesting.  My own project, Factom, is about securing all that data for a fixed number of transactions per year through the magic of Merkle Trees.  
As far as Data and Bitcoin is concerned, I'm not just going to claim I can manage data on my node.  You really can't do that, as you have to accept the blocks mined or leave Bitcoin.  No, I have been working for nearly two years on Factom as a solution that can secure arbitrary amounts of data against Bitcoin's proof of work for a fixed overhead to Bitcoin of less than 13 mb per year.  
For example, a good guy put out some Entry Credits for Factom for free on Reddit.  We saw that most people wouldn't have the tech or savey to make use of them, so we deployed some Java code to make entries with those credits.   Some attacker grabbed our code and dumped 30 mb of cuss words into Factom and burned all the Entry Credits.  Net increase in overhead to Bitcoin?  0 bytes.   We did our 144 transactions like we do every day, and the Merkle trees ate the rest.
So there are solutions to all of this, and there are people working to solve problems.  And they are not all Bitcoin Core.

Still not seeing a reference.  You have a citation for the difference between promised bandwidth and available bandwidth?
I am meaning congested.  Because talking about subscription vs capacity is meaningless without understanding usage.   And if the usage went up over (say) the next 15 years to be constant and very close to the stated subscription level, then capacity would either be scaled to match, or the use cases driving traffic would fail.

I've met and talked to all sides.  Nobody is evil here, and Gavin is about as genuine and smart as they come.  Look at the blocksizes right now.

@_date: 2016-02-03 16:12:32
My point is that everyone gets the same "benefit" and to exactly the same extent.
For me to benefit from SW giving more transactions, I depend on most everyone upgrading.  If I upgrade, my only benefit from doing so is somewhat lower transaction fees.  My own transaction isn't statistically significant one way or another in determining how many transactions go into a block.

Got to work somewhere around 10 am, and back home by midnight. On a Saturday.  To do again tomorrow as I do most weekends.
I'm working on a "scam" to apply Bitcoin's proof of work to an unlimited number of applications at a cost to Bitcoin of about 13 MB of transactions per year to Bitcoin.  No change to the Bitcoin protocol required.  Allows Bitcoin to secure documents, trade assets, do settlement, audit business processes, provide cheap, fast, and efficient data integrity.
I could push for small blocks to force adoption of Factom.  I went with this architecture because it scales, and could help Bitcoin scale.  Factom isnt bothered by small blocks.  But using Factom should be a choice, not forced by fees to move meta protocols to Factom or Ethereum or whatever.
Quite the scam.

Meh.  Karma.  best to ignore.


You are not alone on that.


Potentially LN could be absolutely amazing.  It could be a way to earn transaction fees that are way more valuable than interest on your money would be.  (because nodes on a route get paid a little bit.)
Ultimately we have to have some kind of solution like LN.
@_date: 2016-02-28 03:03:21
Your math?
@_date: 2016-02-10 23:39:38
I would say this.  Perhaps the most rational thing would be a hard fork to 8 MB, with a soft limit at 2 MB.  Soft limits have worked in Bitcoin for years and years.   And then once we have SW and maybe The Lightning Network, we can know where the limit should be.
Then downsizing to the right size is a soft fork.   A much safer, easier way to not commit to a blocksize than to commit to a 2 MB hard fork maybe followed by a 4 MB hard fork, and maybe followed by another yet.  Then after all that, maybe decided we need to downsize to some point.
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:19:13
I put it along side exaggerating the risks of raising the blocksize (since most code doesn't check, nor actually have to check the blocksize to maintain security) while minimizing the damage to the security of Bitcoin when old code can't validate transactions (since SW outputs look like "anyone can spend" outputs).
The reality:  Changing the protocol (soft or hard) carries risks.  Whether one change is more risky than another 1) is not absolutely determined by the fork that must result being "hard" or "soft", and 2) what your stake in Bitcoin really is.  
2) is absolutely critical.  If you are a wallet company, payment processor, speculator, miner, exchange, smart contract project, meta protocol enthusiast -- then the risk of hitting the 1 MB limit risks the rate of adoption, the value of the token, and in many cases your business model.
If you are just worried about centralization, and you are comfortable equating blocksize to centralization pressure (they are not equal, and there are more variables involved), then you are clearly going to measure risk differently.
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:34:06
Because if we run smack into the 1 MB limit and we shed use cases, and we drive people to other alternatives so Bitcoin has fewer uses, less value, and less adoption then it will be more decentralized. /s
One of the most true statements I heard at the Scaling Bitcoin Conference in Hong Kong was that there are many variables that drive centralization, of which larger blocks are one.  But maybe not even the biggest one.

Big blocks provide centralization pressure.
So does a fee market.
The latter in my mind is the greater risk.  The former is the bigger risk in your mind, I think.  We will find out how bad a fee market will be, because we have just entered this zero sum game.  Hopefully you are right.

The design of Bitcoin makes the assumption of a majority of honest participants.  The fact that a majority can effectively change the protocol is not as much an existential threat to Bitcoin but the way Bitcoin was designed to work.  Changing the rules via soft fork or hard fork caries risk.  One could deploy a blocksize change as a soft fork;  it wouldn't be less risky to the ecosystem that way, just more complicated.
Other than having significant (for me) Bitcoin holdings and a couple years full time work in the ecosystem, I have no financial reason to be opposed to a fee market.  
I have talked to miners, people that develop wallet software, payment processors, merchants, Bitcoin core developers, and Bitcoin advocates.   The overwhelming balance of those I have talked to would like to avoid a "Fee Market" if that means running smack into the 1 MB limit.   Boosting to 2 MB was the clear choice by most at the Scaling Bitcoin Conferences in Montreal and Hong Kong.
I do have a pretty good relationship with Peter Todd, LukeJr, and others that feel strongly that we shouldn't change the hard limit.   I have read their arguments, and have not found them compelling.  Again and again I notice that people really working directly in the Bitcoin ecosystem want to push off this block limit issue by at least pushing to 2 MB.
Financially (providing a scalability solution like Factom) I ought to be in the small block camp.  It would force people to our protocol.  But I believe what I am doing shouldn't be rushed either.  Factom is easily 100x maybe 1000x more complicated than SW.  A year of rapid adoption of the Factom protocol would be way better than a forced eviction to Factom; I am a true believer in what I am doing, and don't think I need to evict business models from Bitcoin to succeed.

The obvious solution is to put your hashes in Factom.  That gives you an api that is easier to manage, eliminates the need to handle crypto (for applications that otherwise don't need crypto), places your hashes very fast, allows you to enumerate them without searching the whole blockchain, and costs you 1/10 as much.
Oh, and scales.  Your app shares the fixed 13 MB Factom puts into Bitcoin, no matter what the fees are, or blocksize limit becomes.
A crypto graphic proof to Bitcoin works no matter how big a merkle tree it is based on; you don't end up trusting Factom for your proofs.

Just for the sake of clarity, you said:


Is there anyone working on Core that *is not a developer*?  If so, what are these other roles that matter enough to qualify as "working on Core"?
In particular, as the consensus algorithm actually runs on, is defined by, and has no meaning outside of mining, how then how can consensus be rationally defined without including miners?
Note to self.  Miners called a roundtable, and members of Bitcoin Core came to HK and presented.  And a consensus was declared.  Coincidence? 
@_date: 2016-02-15 02:58:08
You do risk centralization.  Slamming into the 1mb limit isn't going to be pretty, and it will take down value as well as use cases.
The solutions that can be put in place first for payment processors without a hard fork is to make deals with miners to prioritize their transactions.  Then collect transactions and settle (on the blockchain) between payment processors.
Now you have turned a decentralized protocol into a decentralized protocol largely under the control of a set of businesses and private transactions are pushed to the side.
There are other annoying scenarios.  Really none of them look good to miners (thus they all called for a hard fork to 2mb at the Scaling Bitcoin Conferences).  Wallet and other infrastructure companies and payment processors all voiced the same concerns.
But who cares.  Not your problem, right?

The interesting benefit of SW isn't a slightly lower fee.  See [Eric Lombrozo's 5 benefits of Segregated Witness](
It is disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst to assert SW will lower fees when transaction pressure is almost certainly going to raise fees much higher than a 1/4 fee on signatures is going to lower fees, if SW is the solution to transaction pressure for the next 6 to 8 months or more, per the Core Roadmap.
The transaction volume allowed is limited by the blocksize and transaction size.  SW reduces the apparent transaction size to legacy code, and changes the math for SW code.   My transaction doesn't really increase or decrease transaction volume statistically.  And my transaction has no impact on transaction size statistically.   So my use of SW doesn't make my transaction significantly easier to put in a block if the volume is way higher than the blocksize allows (unless we add code that puts old transactions "at the end of the line" by miners;  possible, doable, and maybe even a good idea that makes your statement true, but hasn't been discussed as far as I have heard).  
Only if everyone uses SW do we get the full benefit of SW, and if everyone else is using it, I get the same benefit as everyone else if I use SW or I do not.  With the only exception being a slight fee difference.  Which isn't an interesting benefit.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:05:04
Most people angling for 2 MB block increase are not against SW, but against SW *as the only relief to transaction pressure*.   The major objection to SW as a solution to transaction pressure is the complexity of software upgrades required, the timeframe (lag) for SW to add support for more transactions, and the lower return on additional transactions provided for by SW.
We are already beginning to fill blocks with just the natural transaction volume.  SW does not increase the effective blocksize immediately, and it doesn't increase it very much.   So instead of 2 MB in about a month or so as a Maximum Blocksize (the 2 MB increase does not boost the typical blocksize), in April or May we get SW, and a couple months of adoption puts the increase in blocksize to 1.3 to 1.5 MB in 4 to 6 months.  Or longer.
A boost in Bitcoin price has always been accompanied by boosts in transaction volume.  When transactions fail or crawl, the Bitcoin price suffers.   So any run up on Bitcoin token value will be suppressed without space to accommodate some transaction volume increase.  Without a greater maximum capacity, Bitcoin is vulnerable to spam attacks (which we have already seen, only they are easier now), and  Bitcoin is vulnerable to its own success.

Core may have their eyes wide open, but the path is set.  We are at full blocks, and we are in a zero sum game.
For your reference:


When you say some uses are more valuable than other uses, you are merely talking about who wins the game, and who loses.  The criteria becomes fees.  Now is the willingness to pay a fee really the best measure of the value of a transaction to the Bitcoin ecosystem?  Well, never mind.  We need not answer that question since the mold is set.  
RBF just makes it easier to drive fees up; it doesn't make more space for transactions.
If it turns out that denial of "causal" transactions and "internet commerce" is actually a significant problem in the ecosystem, then we might still see a "Controversial Hard Fork" even if some think it "cannot happen".  After all, as it is set now, Core has given us months of full blocks to educate the ecosystem about what that feels like.

Factom places 13 MB in Bitcoin per year.  Period.  Then as you say, the proofs depend on Bitcoin, not Factom.
So ignoring the centralization issue of recording, the proofs are not.  And even if centralized, you know enough about the Factom protocol to know the severs accept the commit prior to knowing what they committed to record.  So even as we run Factom to day on our servers, the trust is in Bitcoin and math.
Once running on the federated servers, even Factom's servers will be decentralized.

A hard fork occurs when the longest proof of work is in dispute.  Omitting transactions does not cause a hard fork.


SW requires a super majority.  That is because while old code miners will accept SW blocks, the reverse is not true, because old code won't properly record and validate SW transactions.  SW would require a hard fork to reverse back out.


Of course.  This is why they literally and repeatedly called for a blocksize increase.


Colored coins, Counterparty, payment processors, merchants, all will not have options for growth soon, or can't use lightning networks. 
LN is at least months if not years away from having enough infrastructure, users, and merchants from being a real alternative.
Lightning networks will require low fees and space in blocks to launch and establish value as a network.  SW won't be in place nor yield enough space to launch LN by itself.


SW and LN are the future.  If we have a protocol and market position when they come on line.


The internet took years to develop.  As did Facebook.  Phones took decades.  As did point of sale solutions.  
None of this happens fast.  Meanwhile back on the ranch, Bitcoin transactions double every year. And blocks are filling up now.


Walk me through a LN transaction.  What does a user/merchant do to set up a channel?  Will a merchant risk locking up funds with a customer? What software is the merchant running for point of sale?  What is the customer running?  Where?  How does axxounting work? How do the monitor they channels? If breaking down a channel costs too much, how are small  transactions justified?  What if users need money in a channel, but the other party is offline or non-responsive?
The big one is money service, money transmission business regulation.  When routing funds, each node is transmitting value between two other parties.  Will this be legal?  Why?  And even if it is somehow, will merchants accept the risk?
All this (even if there are answers) takes the to market and adopt.  And the plan is for this to grow faster than Bitcoin?  Right out of the gate?  Really?

You brought up ants as being opposed to "real Bitcoin users", and in a way that implied the ants were unimportant.  That I disagree with.  This is a pivot to apply my disagreement to some statement about the size of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
That Bitcoin is small and needs layers of tech to scale I completely agree.  That even now we are a limited and sparsely used value and payment system is beyond question in my opinion.
I disagree with the idea that throttling transaction volume (largely by doing nothing more than adhering to a historical and arbitrary hard limit) is the right path for growth.  Even all the layering tech we are building  like LN will need more space. And the years of rejecting changes to the hard limit has been about throttling transaction volume.  Assuming 1.5 to 2 X growth (which we can accommodate via SW) over the next 14 to 36 months (depending on the small block advocate you talk to) is just that.


Sorry, but what?  DNS isn't a payment processor or store of value.  Cash might be, but how is it centralized for payments?
And your assumption that Bitcoin at 2 mb or even an 8 mb *hard limit* means you are going to fill up that space.  Hardly;  we absolutely could place soft limits to manage growth, and update them as needed.   And Google Fiber could support even much larger block sizes.  32 MB blocks / 10 minutes / 60 seconds * 8 (conversion to bits) * (8 peers  + 1 messages) = 3.84 Mb.  Out of 1000 Mb symmetrical bandwidth that Google Fiber provides.  A [6 TB drive for $288]( can hold 3.5 years of data (6 TB/ (32 MB * 2 for indexing overhead)/ 6 (get hours) / 24 (get days) / 365.25 (get years).   Of course this assumes totally full blocks (bad assumption) and assumes zero pruning or compression (bad assumption).
This idea that increasing the block size to 2 MB or 3 MB (which divides the numbers above by 10+) will drive Bitcoin to enterprise server racks is even rejected by Bitcoin Core. And even larger blocksizes do not centralized running nodes unless the value of Bitcoin continues to stagnate.


What?  I don't see a point here either.  BTW, my wife and I are grandparents.




Fascinated with augur... I think we have the same sort of problem with asset trading on Bitcoin.  It can be moved to Factom, but not to LN.




Suddenly we are not ants?  Do you have any idea how many "large sums of value" have to be moved on "non-anthill" payment networks?
And if only really large orgs use the blockchain, isn't that centralizing? 


Never made by me in this conversation.  I only point out that slamming into the 1 MB wall *is the scenario where the market (miners) hard fork to Classic*.  I don't think that's good or optimal.  Totally sympathetic though.

So you feel the original vision should be abandoned?  That only high value transactions at relatively high cost should be transacted on Bitcoin?
Is that limit $10? $100?  Or maybe $1000?
After all, on boarding millions could push that limit pretty high.  But then LN won't work as a decentralized solution because the channel initiation and breakdown costs would also be high, and not necessarily under such high "dust" levels.

We haven't spent 2 years hitting the hard limit.  I've read Rusty's work.  It doesn't deny transaction volume growth, but defends an estimated transaction growth that we actually saw.  
In June he posted the fact that we were not seeing full blocks.  And then he was right.  I haven't seen him claim we are not filling blocks now.
So now we are hitting limits, and if we had a run up in value, we have no room for additional transactions.  That always happens in a bull run, a burst of transactions.  So to grow, we have to cut out use cases?  To attract more people and more demand, we have to vacate the "bums"?
Let's use land as a metaphor.
In an unlimited market, we have a " land run" mentality where the value of adoption and change is not in competition and zero sum choices.  It is in establishing new businesses and building new economic networks motivated by an initial cheap resource (free land) that everyone sees as being valuable in the future.
Once established, land prices rise to reflect the utility of the location and its infrastructure.  Land remains cheap in the world where infrastructure and network.effects do not exist.
Driving prices up first prior to development of infrastructure and established value doesn't work unless there are no alternatives.  Bitcoin competes againat well funded, established payment networks.  Yet it has grown via its "lower costs" which it has via the rewards.  Those rewards dominate for 8 to 12 years yet.  
So what's the need for a fee market now?  Why artificially cull use cases prior to having the infrastructure to support them?

Not how SW works.  As people upgrade to SW, signatures are kept "to the side" (sort of) for SW transactions.   Only to the extent that wallets and other transaction generating applications move to the SW format will blocks be reduced in size.
Since legacy code (not upgraded to SW) will only download the blocks without signatures included, blocks will be able to hold more transactions.  The downside is that these new SW outputs look like "Anyone can spend" outputs, so transactions spending SW outputs cannot be validated by old software.
But this is a soft fork.  That means (while old software can't validate these transactions, and miners that do not upgrade cannot validate transactions or properly build blocks anymore) everyone continues to see the same longest chain of PoW.
**tl;dr**  Everyone gets the same blocks.  Even people that don't upgrade get the benefit of more transactions in blocks, with the caveat that a failure to upgrade means one cannot generate SW transactions, nor validate the new SW transactions.

More space with more fees?  Or you mean you can win a zero sum game?  Or use child pays for parent effectively doubling block space to win space. 




Nah, they just go where they can transact, and Bitcoin loses value. 


Don't know what you are asking.  Factom, my project, is aided by restricting blocks.  We put a fixed number of anchors into Bitcoin each 10 minutes.  No matter how much data we secure.


I'm not even sure who you are arguing with, or which investors matter in your view.
Bitcoin hasn't won yet.  It isn't adopted yet.  It's a little early to claim we have all the capacity we need, as has been the claim for years.




We have solutions like LN in the works.  And all we have to do is keep Bitcoin viable until solutions are put in place.  It's completely a strawman argument to paint bip101 as having been the only solution proposed.  Or that any block size increase == block use, when this has never ever been true, or that the parties wanting a blocksize increase want zero fees.

Let's be clear before we bash Brian too much.
A fee market is good for Coinbase.  Why?  Because Coinbase provides transactions off blockchain between individuals.  They can provide (if they don't already) mass settlement between exchanges (so you can move your bitcoin again, off blockchain and avoid fees).  They can set up an agreement with BitPay and do the same thing, avoid on blockchain transactions via a Coinbase wallet and Bitpay software.
Basically, Bitcoin can be removed from many transaction scenarios as a distributed, autonomous, trustless payment system, to a centralized, managed, and government happy system.   And the motivator to leave all the true Bitcoin wallets behind?  Fees.
Because that is what running into the hard limit on transactions does, it raises fees.  Removes the small transactions (the "Entry Drug" of Bitcoin) from the market.  And Coinbase is in the position to capitalize on that.
So as you bash Brian, keep in mind that either he *really, really* is retarded and doesn't understand the short term opportunity to corner a huge portion of the market that the average Joe assumes to be the utility of Bitcoin...
*Or he really is trying to promote some solution to a real and present danger to the Bitcoin protocol, as he sees it.*
Being in much the same position, and saying many of the same things (without actually endorsing Classic), I can relate.  I see ignoring the hard limit to be a huge and unnecessary risk.  And if the pain goes too high, Classic or something like it will be the solution we get.
Or Brian is all wet, and there really isn't any risk to shedding 20 to 50 percent of the transaction volume possible on Bitcoin between now and 2017.

 Lighting is really cool.  It really is trading Bitcoin, it really is as secure as Bitcoin, at least potentially (vast network outages preventing you from closing channels being maybe the biggest additional risk).  It makes transactions fast and safe, and it requires (potentially) a fraction of the blockchain to support.
I started to write a description, but it gets complicated and I don't have time.  Here is a link to their [summary.]( (It's a pdf.  Sorry if that is annoying).
I do think we have to eventually get to something like LN.  But my objection is leaping for a solution when we haven't built, deployed, tested, and validated said solution.   Growing the blocksize to accommodate another year or two is within reason for our hardware and network, and gives us time to put a solution into place.

on this point is right.  Like I said, it may not be the common use case, but we don't put any limitations on what an application may wish to write into an entry.

Factom is a protocol to collect nearly unlimited entries, hash them together, and secure them via a single hash to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes.

If you can go into a room and convert your dollar to gold (without anyone's permission, without fail, and without ambiguity), yes.  I'd say it was redeemable for Gold.
What you are describing is finding a buyer.  No buyer is necessary to convert Factoids to Entry Credits, and at any point in time you know exactly how many Entry Credits you will get.

You have to put blank lines between my statements and yours.  Here it is fixed:








We do sell a "transferable version" of Entry Credits.  Those are the Factoids.  They represent the value of the protocol, and thus can change in so-called real terms (i.e. value in dollars) over time.
But business wants to have a fixed cost.  If it is 1/10 a cent per entry, great.
I get in the end that you would like to take a distributed autonomous protocol and stuff it in a "Box of Software at Best Buy" model.  There are some differences, primarily because the "Rights" to obligate the protocol are issued at a fixed rate to the servers that run the protocol.  That's true if they are handling 10 million entries, or if they are handling 10 billion entries.  Of course, the value of the protocol is 1000x greater if Factom is handling 10 billion entries over 10 million.
If a Factoid is worth 15 cents on the market, then you will be able to buy 150 entry credits with a Factoid.  Obviously 1000 Factoids would get you a healthy supply of Entry Credits.
The right to obligate the protocol isn't the same thing as cashing in that right.  As long as you can transfer that right, it is subject to change in value.  Once you have purchased your Entry Credits, however, the value is fixed.
This is just what we went over before.  I hope this helps.

If they are different, the bank is right.  If the bank loses their record, then it didn't exist.  That is how systems of record work in today's world.   There are procedures and protocols to prevent tampering, but they are not perfect across system of record boundaries.


A website isn't a reliable publishing vehicle.  The Blockchain is though...


There are hosts of attacks that can be made against websites.  I am not sure why you are pushing this as a means of securing finanical documents.  The incentives of Facebook, Twitter, Google, and the New Your Times to maintain your records are not aligned.  And they will not sign up as being responsible if those hashes are (when they are) modified somehow.


This is the thing that Factom gets right.  It secures the head of the directory block for Factom.  The directory block defines the entry blocks for all the Factom Chains used by the users of Factom.  The Factom Chain can be documented in the Mortgage itself. Once you have the chain, you know where everyone is supposed to be placing their signed hashes of what is going on with this mortgage.


The originator.  The Bank that created the mortgage backed security.  The first administrator of the loan.  The next Bank that owned the loan.  Etc.  In the case of BOA, the loans with problems were inherited by Country Wide.  But as such a system progressed, you might want any survey, any insurance work, etc. to be records in the chain.  With the meta data, you can certainly ensure that all this data is private, but you want to be able to validate it all.

Factom is essentially that kind of system.  We use [Merkle Trees]( instead of a simple index list, but it amounts to the same thing.
The apparent complexity comes from adding features that provide censorship resistance, cryptocurrency isolation, decentralized compilation of submitted data, etc.   I say apparent complexity because Factom follows a rather long series of steps to ensure proper recording and securing of data.  However, it is the same series of steps for each bit of data.  So while complex, Factom execution is pretty easy to validate and verify.

EXACTLY!  The Bitcoin protocol defines a coinbase that rewards the miner 100 confirmations after the fact.  In other words, the *protocol* holds the Bitcoin until the consensus algorithm plays out and the protocol is sure who gets the reward.
That is how a miner that gets a block doesn't end up the with the reward should another fork collect a greater proof of work over the first miner.
This isn't possible without the protocol being the escrow agent for the consensus algorithm.

It is just friendly advice.  I think if you look through my histories, about the worst it gets is accusations of trolling.  After I have fed the troll so long that you would have thought they would have exploded already.  Or am I the troll?!?  Nah, that couldn't be.
You will note that I defended you (when I finally realized there was a thread).  
The Factom message is rather complex for something trying to provide a simple feature:  Chains of timestamped entries.   Most of these entries will be hashes.  Most of these entries will be signed by a set of applications and users.  They may very well be encrypted too.
So when the obvious use is Factom as a verification and validation layer gets confused with what people can do with Factom if they so choose, then you get these arguments.
Likewise I get into arguments about the idea that specific data that MUST be in Factom for factom to perform.  That isn't true either.
This is why I try to get into these discussions early, and why threads like this are so important to Factom.  Early on I had discussions with people that convinced me I had to be concerned about a number of scenarios, including this one.  
Even the fact that the Chain ID is the hash of a Chain Name was due to a realization that Entry Blocks and Directory Blocks cannot have user defined information if we want the structures to 1) validate yet 2) resist placing arbitrary data into the structures.

And Bitcoin doesn't balance its inflation rate at all, outside of burnt and lost Bitcoin (which in most cases cannot be verified;  Factom will have that drain as well).

So here is my reply (Which is also posted in nearly the same form on the blog itself)
**The Easily Inserted Data Problem**


I am not aware of any data that, when you verify a signature, causes a program to crash.  Since an Auditor need not process any data that isn't properly signed, this scenario isn't really very likely.


Well, yeah.  If signature checking crashes your auditor, you may need to upgrade your libraries.  I would suggest you use a Factom Chain to track updates to the application to ensure your application can be updated over time.  Like any software under any system.


While this is true, the difficulty does not arise because you have validated data.  It is quite true that software updates can strike any system at all that attempts to use a base of data to make distributed decisions.  Bitcoin itself has suffered from bad updates.


Actually no, because the new chain can point to the references in the old chain, plus carry the verification and validation records by the authorities that produced the "clean" chain.  So no, you don't lose the timestamping at all.  
**The Illegal Possession Problem**


None of the validation and verification layers hold data.  Only the Entries, and they are not required to validate directory blocks nor entry blocks.  So once the copyrighted mp3 data has been identified, it can be removed from Factom without impacting the chain you wish to "disrupt".  And since the signatures wouldn't have matched in the first place, your Factom client is unlikely to have even stored the data.  Not sure how disruptive this really is.  And oh by the way, your 3 Meg attack cost $3 and it is easily and automatically tossed aside.
Note that a Poem is protected by copyright, and can be inserted into Bitcoin, and would be required forever to validate the blockchain.  So this isn't unique to Factom, only Factom has an answer while inserting data directly into Bitcoin does not.


So nodes drop those entries.  **Entry data isn't required to validate Entry Blocks or directory blocks.**  While some nodes will not care and will serve up the entries in any event, applications using Factom have any tools to avoid malicious entries and still validate and verify their chains of data.


The idea that open source is evil is a strange argument to make.
**The Game Theoretical Problem Of Releasing Data**
"Furthermore, all the rewards of running the Factom network come entirely on the insert side. That is, if you happen to win the right to add a Record Entry, you get paid some Factoids. "
Not how Factom works.  I'd suggest the author read the Factom Consensus Paper.


In general, the only way a Federated Server is a Federated Server is that they have more support from the applications and users of the protocol than other servers that would like to be Federated Servers.  If the Federated Servers failed to provide the data their users need, or provide the incentives to ensure their users were provided for, then they will get voted out in favor of someone that would.  
Of course, this again isn't how Factom works.  No data can be placed in Factom that isn't available to everyone in the network.  And anyone can provide the data to anyone else.  So it isn't even up to the Federated Servers alone to make this data available.  Again, I'd suggest Jimmy read the consensus paper.
**The Game Theoretical Problem of Keeping Data**


So someone has written out 1+ Billion entries, but now only wants to write 100 bytes per day.  Seems... Okay, kinda strange.  Still.
To add to a chain, the Federated Servers only need the last entry block, not any entry data.  And OBTW Federated Servers have to be able to support all chains.  Or they are voted out.  They can do this because the verification and validation layers of factom don't depend on having the entry data.  That is only needed to construct the layers in the first place.  Again, I would encourage you to read the Consensus paper.


Every node needs the Directory blocks and a small set of book keeping chains.   Users of the protocol will want to keep their own chains.  The Federated Servers and the users will look for solutions that ensure their data is maintained.
Bitcoin requires everyone to have everything.  That is great, but doesn't scale without mechanisms for pruning and establishing domains.  Side chains is a solution that allows value to move into smaller domains and back to Bitcoin.  
Factom builds this solution in up front.  The structures everyone needs are very small.  And further updates to the protocol (adding network segments and clustering) will allow Factom to scale into the 100K entries per second range.


Timestamping doesn't prove the negative.  Verisign doesn't appear to have any information about timestamping.  See Peter Todd's discussion:

In this context, there is no difference.  I prefer converted, but burned or converted means the same thing.
There is no "then back into Factoids" ... Burned means they go out of the system, and converted to Entries would mean the same thing.
The Servers are issued the same rate of Factoids regardless of how many Factoids leave the system.  It is a flow in, balanced with a flow out as entries are written.

You can go to [Github]( and find the documentation for Factom, including its APIs.
The white paper discusses this, and can be found at the same link.  We did a demo you can explore on the [Factom Website]( where we hashed the books found in the Project Gutenberg, and placed them all in entries into a chain in Factom.
Each entry had the title of the work, the author, and the hash of the book.
We hashed ~29000 books.  A book is either in this chain or it is not.

Factoids are converted into Entry Credits, which can be used to create entries and entry chains.
The servers are paid a fixed number of Factoids per day, independent of the use of the protocol.  
So Factoids flow into the ecosystem at a fixed rate, and leave at the rate determined by the value of the Factoids and the volume of the use of the Protocol.

Decentralization has real advantages between organizations which are very loath to trust software being run by other parties.  But software everyone runs at the same time, validating add you go, well that can be trusted.
The fascinating thing is that centralized ledgers can inherit the trust of distributed ledgers when hashes are published to distributed ledgers.  Because once published, the centralized system can't go back on them.  It doesn't work the other way around as neatly, as centralized systems can rework or deny what isn't provably known.
Lastly, exposing the blockchain for such use is way cheaper than Bitcoin if one doesn't mine.  But it still costs something.
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:29:30
It is, but storing hashes in Factom can secure potentially very large data sets where the storage of such data sets is very cheap. By putting the hash into Factom, the cheap storage easily and transparently inherits the immutable, timestamped, distributed features of Factom and the Bitcoin Blockchain, for very low cost (~1/10 of a penny an entry).

Factom seeks to add data security via Bitcoin.  There are people that need the  security that do not have a "coin" problem.  But you do not have the security without Bitcoin, and you cannot be decentralized without incentives built within Factom's protocol.
The token in Factom is built to manage access to the protocol, and distribute incentives to the servers that run the protocol.
Factom is also designed such that those using the protocol can do so with whatever payment method they like, and are not forced to use Factom's token.  We will be creating this gateway, and it will use Bitcoin as well as other payment systems.  The latter will likely be more expensive because, well, those payment systems are more expensive.
It is in the interest of Bitcoin to get the world using the Blockchain for more than just coins.  Securing data is a huge use cases, and it should be done using Bitcoin, and in a way that doesn't bloat Bitcoin with everyone's data.  And we believe it should be done in a decentralized protocol patterned after Bitcoin itself.  And without creating yet another mined altcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:35:48
Drop the data.
None of the verification and validation layers require the data stored in an entry.  
You can put a copyrighted poem into the Bitcoin Blockchain.  But nobody can drop such an entry without breaking the mechanisms for validating and verifying blocks and transactions.  Factom allows for the documentation of such entries, and dropping them doesn't damage the Directory Blocks or Entry Blocks.

Bitcoin keeps a "score".  You can't do anything but trade it, yet any Bitcoin you hold is quite clearly defining an exact percentage of the "capitalization" of Bitcoin.  You can go to [Crypto-Currency Markets]( to see the capitalization of all sorts of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.
Clearly if you own 31 BTC out of 14066500 Bitcoin in existence, you own 31/14066500 * 100 percent of the total capitalization of Bitcoin, i.e. .0002203817 % of Bitcoin.   The fact that I can calculate your share, does that make Bitcoin a security?
Factoids allow users to sell access to the Factom protocol, or to gain access to the Factom protocol.  This is because Factoids can be converted into Entry Credits and assigned to a public key.  Such an "anointed" key can sign messages to create Factom chains, and sign messages to add entries to Factom chains, and the protocol will accept said messages.
So while you cannot call Bitcoin a "software license", Factoids clearly are distributions of software rights that can be exercised by users that control them.
Bitcoin and Factoids can be sold to anyone that wants to buy them, by anyone that has control of them.  (At least, Factoids will be tradable at the end of the crowd sale).
Of course, you know all this, but a refresher is always nice, eh? :D
@_date: 2015-04-01 17:40:55
Companies that just want to use the protocol have no driving reason to buy Factoids.  I expect most companies who want to use the Factom protocol will never care much about Factoids at all.
Factom divides the crypto mechanisms for incentivizing servers and trading Factoids from the companies and applications that want to use the protocol.   
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:11:28
While you are right on this point, I'd be a bit more diplomatic.  After all, you have been rather wrong too about how the entry data is handled in Factom, and how the incentive structure works, and how the law in the US handles servers that manage user data.
This is not a big issue for Factom, nor applications that use Factom for ordered and timestamped data secured against the blockchain.

Only 30 percent of the tokens go to people building the tech.  All the others are sold.  20% to those who supported the development so far, and 50% in this software sell.  This will fix a number of constants.  One is the server payout, which will be 20% of the tokens sold in the software sell.  Just to make the math easy, suppose we sell 1000 tokens over the next 45 days. Then at the end of the sale, we distributed:
* 50% software sale = 1000 tokens
* 20% pre purchase = 200 tokens
* 30% incentives = 300 tokens
And we set the yearly server payout to be be 200 tokens.
In five years the servers will have earned 1000 tokens, equal to the crowd sale.  In ten years, they will have earned as much as the total of all the tokens distributed.
So, no.  We do not have a Ripple like distribution.

Don't forget the Bitcoin mafia... Open source and claiming to have value.
It is the nature of distributed applications.  It is the network effect that lends value, and large collections of people will need infrastructure that provides incentives for people to build upon it.
Bitcoin is rather unique and the largest body of proof of work.  That is why Factom is simply a layer over Bitcoin.  It provides an easy place to organize and publish time stamped, ordered data in a way that extends Bitcoin rather than competes with Bitcoin.

Nice as always to talk to you.  You know, we both live in Austin, so we could just get together and go over all of this.  But that's not going to happen, I'm guessing.  So here's a summary of where I am at in this discussion:
The scripting engine in any token fails to allow what can be done in a protocol. Factom needs protocol functions to be viable. I know you don't believe this, but it's true.
If you take ten bright and honest programmers, give them a problem, you'll get ten solutions.  The ones that work will follow only a small set of approaches. 
I know you don't accept my approach to this problem.  But you can't articulate any options.  And that's where we are.
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:04:06
Sorry, that didn't make any sense.  What are you saying?  I should change "Factoids" to "Magic Beans"?


Uhhh.  Yes there is.  Factom has a chain that defines the conversion rate from Factoids to Entry Credits.  It can be changed, but any change takes 8 hours to go into effect.
So at any point in time, there is a fixed rate of Factoids to Entry Credits.

Factom is having a software sale, as these tokens carry with them the right to obligate the protocol to write entries into Factom.  
Of course, we have discussed this elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:04:55
We have a token to create incentives for the servers that run the protocol.  If we had a centralized solution that paid servers Bitcoin, we could get rid of the token.  But of course if transactions with Factom involved Bitcoin, the number of transactions would be rather large and defeat the purpose of lifting these transactions off the blockchain.
Decentralization tends to require incentives and a protocol that can manage them, so these solutions trend towards a token of some kind.  But please note that *Users* of Factom never have to touch the token, and the Entry Credits help to limit the book keeping as Users of Factom write entries.  
@_date: 2015-04-05 12:31:46






Factom will have 32 federated servers (which each serve as leaders for a portion of the chains), and 32 audit servers which are prepared to replace any of the federated servers that may go down or fail.
 On top of these servers, any Factom node that holds the data can do so, and the data will validate. So removing the data from Factom can't be done by simply removing the data from even the core 64 servers.
Servers are elected via delegated proof of use (built off private keys that hold entry credits) so they are not under our control. 




Factom is cheaper than the Bitcoin blockchain by 10x or more, and 1000x more expensive than simple cloud storage, as the article points out, if you don't care about securing your data against the blockchain.

This really isn't about stupid people at all.  I do think that Factom sometimes comes across as something that will be directly useful to individuals... It really will not be.  is right when he recognises Factom has what he calls "[Premium Features (timestamping/unmodifiability/decentralization)](  It will help if we can get across the idea that these ARE the features of Factom that matter.  If a use case has no need for timestamping, unmodifiability (What I would call immutable auditing), or decentralization, then Factom isn't the solution.
I would add that Factom provides a standardization for accessing these qualities of the blockchain, does so at a minimum cost, and also provides a mechanism to leverage data provided by other sources (since Factom chains can reference data in other Factom chains).
Altoz doesn't think there are any use cases for standardizing and packaging these "Premium Features".  This simply isn't true.  We don't make a big deal about it when discussing the technology (because such discussions should be about the technology), but we haven't been sitting on our hands.  We have been talking to many, many potential customers and talking to many experts in Banking, Land Titles, Issues in developing countries, Insurance, and more.  Even people in the Music industry see a need for immutable audit trails in creating fair royalty distribution and even in lowering the costs of music access.
The point isn't to change anyone's mind.  and others act as watchdogs not only on our project, but on many others.  Being skeptical and raising potential questions is a good thing, which is why looking for the questions (even if posts seem hostile) is very good for us.
And making sure we have considered the questions and have addressed the questions is key to how we run this project.  We can't make everyone happy, but we can and should do everything we can to run an honest and transparent project.

I think the opposite of bullet proof storage would be a data shredder... Factom isn't a shredder.
I believe all data will stay around.  The servers running Factom will have the incentives to insure this is so. But as the link to my comment says, keeping errant data isn't required to building the systems of proofs for data.
Factom is primarily a verification, validation, and time stamping system.  Applications and authorities outside of Factom collect, sign, structure, relate etc data.  It is submitted onto chains in Factom.  That data as a result *on its own + Bitcoin* provides proof and  validation the data existed, was submitted, and no other data was part of that set.
A running Factom protocol will be nice to have, but unnecessary to prove user data.  The Factom ledger is secured entirely by Bitcoin's blockchain.

Nobody should invest in Factom without doing their own research into Factom.   
Can the features of Factom be implemented in a "better way using a less-complicated system?"  We do not believe so.  I did months of research and study before designing Factom, and have repeatedly adjusted and refined the design as we received feedback from dozens of some of the brightest minds in this space.
Still, we are a startup.  Anyone that supports us by purchasing our software in this sale is taking a risk.  That said, we are also doing everything we can to launch a protocol in an honest and transparent fashion.  In that regard, keep in mind the following:
*  All money raised in this sale is held by Koinify until Factom meets a defined set of milestones.
*  The first milestone is a working protocol allowing the full use of the protocol.
* The last milestone (we intend to meet within 6 to 9 months) is the fully autonomous and decentralized execution of the protocol.
In the meantime, we will be working on actual real world projects launched on top of Factom for various countries, companies, and banks.  We expect significant real world use of Factom late in 2015, early 2016.
I can't say enough about the risks of expecting Factom to be a huge success.  But I am doing everything I can to achieve that goal.

Pegging refers to moving value between chains, i.e. moving Bitcoin into another chain, transacted, then moved back to Bitcoin.  (That's a two way peg).

@_date: 2015-04-10 22:05:43
Well, you can store the data.  It is in the entries though, so nobody has to hold offensive data.  
If you are holding the data as a server, you can wait for your DCMA notice to take it down.  If you are an application, when you find someone has put data in your chain that is junk, you discard it rather than save it.
In so many ways this is a red herring.  I think the exploit should come with more backing than porn is too big to go into Bitcoin.  Because, in fact, it isn't.  If someone is willing to pay the transaction fees, they can stuff it into a series of transactions into Bitcoin.  Then publish to the world how to string them together.

Factom stamps to 1 minute.  (White paper, Consensus paper)
I can't find much on time stamping services that allows the construction and verification of a chain so that 1) I know what entries are included, and 2) what entries are not included.
There are also issues of scale, uptime, SLA's, jurisdiction, centralization vs decentralization.
All of that, and Factom is pretty inexpensive.  In the end I know your issue is that 1) Factom has a token, and 2) you have an aversion to a crowd sale of tokens.   
If these are your core issues, I think we should just talk about them.  I don't think trying to make up stuff painting Factom as fundamentally more exposed to the posting of child porn compared to Bitcoin, email, reddit, malware, viruses, torrent programs, or other attack vectors makes much sense.

How does the supply of Factoids increase?  How do they decrease?
Factoids are issued at a fixed rate to the Servers.  As Factoids are used to write entries, they leave the ecosystem.
So how are Factoids converted to Entry Credits?
Factoids have a market price, say 30 cents.
The Federated Servers set an exchange rate of Factoids to Entry Credits of 300 Entry Credits per Factoid (published in Factom, to maintain a price of .001 cents per Entry Credit).
Users then can see the exchange rate in Factom, and they can convert their Factoids to Entry Credits and assign those credits to the public key of their choice.
Why have a Variable Exchange Rate?
The goal is to create a system that both rewards servers for increasing the value of the Factom protocol, as well as maintain a steady cost to those that use the protocol.
Clearly as more and more people pay to use the protocol, the demands on the servers and the protocol will rise.  There should be an increase in rewards that reflects the usage of the protocol.  
We could use transaction fees in Bitcoin (should we figure out who holds the wallet in a distributed application).  This still requires an exchange rate.  Keeping the transaction fee steady in cost for the businesses requires the same sort of posting of the needed transaction fee if the token increases in value.  
That means we still need an exchange rate.
There are not any unicorns harmed in this process.

This is what [Factom]( does, it provides  proofs of ordered data based on the blockchain, organized in named lists (called Factom chains) created by users.  
It does cost something to create these lists, and we choose not to mine, as we anchor the ledger to Bitcoin.  So we have a token.  The sole purpose of the token is to pay transaction fees for data entries.
Since this is exposing just the blockchain, we have entry credits that are nontransferable, that you actually use to write to Factom, and which can be bought from any third party who holds our token.  (These tokens, factoids, can be converted to entry credits and assigned to a specified public key).
This two step process means users of Factom can secure data against the blockchain and never touch a tradable coin or token.

Factom isn't any different.  And certainly not any different than Bitcoin, which you have already been told multiple times in this thread.  Not sure why you are continuing to press this point.
Running a Factom node makes you a *server* of user defined data.  And DCMA requires notices to take down data, and with Factom you can do so, while with Bitcoin or most of the alt coins, you cannot.  A Factom chain documenting child porn may very well be something that shows up very fast, with proper centralized signatures on entries in that chain.  Users then can auto delete such stuff, or challenge it if it isn't actually porn.
The fact is life is messy.  Factom seeks to provide a platform that handles the messiness of life with a set of options for dealing with things as they occur.  Most other solutions do not.

Yes, I remember the "pre mine" years where just a few collected the lion share of all the Bitcoin (50 BTC rewards!).  Now that the rest of us know about it, the reward is half and we compete with everyone else.
We could argue about the distribution of these tokens until the cows come home.   Was it more fair to front weight the distribution of tokens for a hand full of people?  Or is it more fair to have a structured, announced, transparent and open sale of the tokens?
We will have a much more equal distribution of tokens than Bitcoin achieved.  Maybe that is fair, or maybe it isn't.  But it doesn't make either Bitcoin or Factoids securities.
Let's put it this way.   Many of us have worked for nearly a year on Factom, and many others have reviewed, considered, wrote, promoted, and set themselves up to use Factom.   Nearly 70 people will share the 30% slice for early contributors.  Then once Factom is fully up and running, the Federated Servers will get 10% *every single year* of the starting token distribution (20 percent of the crowd sale).
In just 3 years, the servers, who ever they are, will have as many tokens as all of us that made this happen.
Yes we will get money out of the token sale that will help us to build the protocol.  Money that will make us rich?  Not very likely.
Gosh, I am really struggling to find the oppression here.

@_date: 2015-04-02 01:51:29
Factom is designed to tie the value of the protocol to the value of the token (Factoid).  A fixed number of Factoids are paid to the Factom Servers per day, and Factoids exit the ecosystem as entries written into Factom.
So if Factoids are under valued, then the excessive Factoids are burned out of the system via Entries.  If they are over valued, then the supply of Factoids grows.  The balance is where the Factoids in the system represent in value the use of the protocol plus any holding of Factoids by users and speculators.
I can't promise or talk about the upside or downside of the value.  Sorry if that sounds "lawyerly," but them's the reality of doing any kind of sale where a company might come under examination.

I believe in full disclosure.  And I upvoted this thread, and never downvote anything based on a disagreement;  
I am a heavy investor in Factom.
There is no [IPO]( for Factom.  Buying the token might be viewed in many ways, but it does not in any way represent an ownership in the project.

Okay, I am now confused.
Not ... what?  Do you mean "Not much business gets done in business without PR when you need to round up money from suckers?"
Does that even mean anything?
You and I have gone over Factom in detail.  Yes we are raising money.  Yes any new project has risk.  Yes we are as transparent as anyone.  Yes we are developing open source.  No, we do not KYC and AML everyone that buys a token in the sale.  No, we don't get any of the money raised unless we deliver running code.  No, you don't have to trust us (we have Koinify and trusted third parties judging the milestones and holding the keys to the money raised).
That is only a small subset of what we have done to define and secure the value of the Factom protocol, the token, the business process, the design approach, the market, etc.
I have even offered to meet with you and go over Factom in person, as you live in Austin as I do.
I wish you had an objective complaint that could be discussed and addressed.

Factom is the protocol
Factoids are the tokens
Entry Credits are what you need to place an entry into Factom.
At the end of the sale, a Factoid can be converted into 150 Entry Credits.   But that conversion rate floats, maintaining a cost of 1/10 a cent independent of the market price of a Factoid.  This shields businesses who wish to use Factom in their business processes from the ups and downs of a cryptocurrency based protocol.
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:26:57
Simply creating a "Document Chain" as a Factom Chain in Factom, then adding the hash of the document as an entry in that chain does what you want.
Any Entry in Factom is part of a Merkle Tree whose root is placed in Bitcoin, which the Factom Client can provide to the document creation system.
Then the company can get a bit more efficent, and create Merkle roots for all the documents created or modified in the last 10 minutes, and put only one entry into Factom. If a company has a good bit of churn on their documents, all of that could be secured by a single hash every 10 minutes or any other period that they might like.  Factom timestamps to the minute, but really for most purposes the timestamping of a company's document management system is good enough, as long as an entry is placed in Factom every hour or maybe even just once a day.
Obviously this can be tuned many ways.

I think you might be taking a title a little personally.  Factom, Storj, and Maidsafe all have tokens too, like Namecoin.  And Namecoin certainly came first.  But Namecoin hasn't actually resulted in real world, daily use, though it still has the potential to do so.
Signing messages with the blockchain has no real world, pervasive use either.  
Nobody is yet using distributed storage paid with tokens either, so it isn't like this new crowd has delivered.  Thus the "On the Horizon" tag line.
So it remains to be seen who will actually end up in the market in a widely used application of the blockchain for non-coin uses.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:33:00
What I mean is that a centralized party can hold the Factoids.  You can pay them Bitcoin and give them a public key, and they can "charge up" your public key with Entry Credits.
Boom!  Use of the protocol, and never touched a Factoid.
The reason we have Factoids is because they allow us to decentralize the protocol.  The reason we have entry credits is because sometimes it is much better to work with a centralized party that can take payment in Bitcoin, or dollars, or Euros, or Yen, or whatever.
Our design is an attempt to manage the many different needs of many different parties.
We can't have a centralized payment system like Bitcoin to pay out incentives in a decentralized protocol.  At least, not without altering the Bitcoin protocol, which we cannot do.  Furthermore, whoever issues the Entry Credits must have a cryptographically provable right to do so.  Again, our token allows this, while Bitcoin would not.
What you mean is that NOBODY should ever have a token that isn't Bitcoin.  But how does one create a "forked version [that] would just accept Bitcoins?"  Who do you trust to hold the wallet?
Our design answers that question.

Just as some background, the [Howey Test]( is used to define if people are buying a security.  This is just an FYI




1. an investment of money due to
2. an expectation of profits arising from
3. a common enterprise
4. which depends solely on the efforts of a promoter or third party
Factom most likely fails 3.  The Factom Foundation is a non-profit.  It will not distribute profits to anyone.  And Factom does fail 4) the dependency on which the value of the Factoid rests is the distributed Federated Servers, which are an amorphous undefined set of actors.
Bitcoin has pretty much the same problems when it comes to fitting it to the definition of a security.  Back in 2013 there was some talk of defining Bitcoin as a security, but that is pretty much died off at this point.  Factom is even harder to fit to these definitions (as the token as a real world "product" value).

Hmmm.  That explains a great deal, because I find you *VERY* entertaining.  Especially when you contort all over the place to support a difference between one token and another, yet repeatedly claim I am the one with "contortions".  


Because I want to think through what makes a token a "security" and what makes a token pure and clean.  I'm guessing you believe Bitcoin to be the later.  So you were explaining why the Bitcoin token isn't a security, but our Factoids are, I can only guess by the Socratic method...  To wit:  


I am willing to pay, my little Socratic friend!
Yes, there are miners that create Bitcoin tokens and sell them.  Next?  


Bitcoins are issued to miners who win the block reward.  I can only assume you mean "issuing them" as code words for selling a security.  Miners sell Fresh New Bitcoin to individuals, over exchanges, give them as gifts... Whatever people can do with Bitcoin.


Not sure how this question was different from the last.  Miners sell ... Bitcoin?  Could still be a security...

@_date: 2015-04-02 21:53:49






The mortgages changed hands multiple times, and records were lost as systems of record for various periods disappeared. 
Absolutely if there was one system of record, this problem would not occur.




Ditto.  You don't seem to understand though that validation and verification must be done against a system of record.  Backup companies can't do this when the system of record goes away.  




Absolutely, ditto above, and keep in mind that once the records changed hands, BOA didn't have a list of documents to search for.




Some system like this could work, but not across multiple systems.
















These records exchanged hands many times, through many systems of records.  Furthermore BOA isn't going to want to attest to some other record.  So you do need a system that crosses boundries and does not require one bank to trust the records of another.  When Bank A hands a hash and a set of records to Bank B, how does Bank B know the hash is the right one, and the records are the right records?




Or into Factom.




Well, what you really need is a chain for each mortgage, with the appropriate signed hashes from MANY groups as records are created that document the mortgage.  Something really easy to do in Factom, but not so easy with the methods you presented.

I doubt we are making any significant sells of tokens to 16 year olds, and since all sells are in Bitcoin, this isn't "money from the pockets" of anyone.
We will be using the funds raised to support the development and improvement of the protocol.  Of course, we get nothing at all until we deliver a working protocol, and we don't get all of the money until the protocol is fully deployed and running as a autonomous, distributed application.  This is why we brought Koinify onboard.  We want an honest distribution of the tokens.
Is it actually "ill gotten gains" to raise money and deploy a software system that meets the specification set out ahead of time and judged by independent and significant parties in the space?  I don't think so.
Do we have a "giant marketing team"?  Well, we do have three or four people that work on marketing to some degree.   We have explained the idea to a dozen or so more that have signed up to be community leaders.   And we have a number of people coming on board to oversee the running of Factom, and ensure that we are responsible with our resources.
I get that many believe Factom to be a stupid idea.  Why would anyone want an immutable distributed ledger when building an immutable centralized ledger is so easy?
After talking to many in the industry and in many countries, and at a few banks, it turns out that the combination of being an immutable distributed ledger is very compelling for their use cases.  If this isn't important to you, then I'd guess you either have a solution that works "good eough,"  or you have no real need for the solution.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:43:26
Not actually what I meant.  Bitcoin isn't constructed to solve the problem Factom is addressing, and verification and validation are functions that are not value functions.
I am not entirely sure why you would think Bitcoin's scaling or not scaling lends or doesn't lend value to verification, validation, and time stamping of general purpose data...
@_date: 2015-04-10 11:25:24
We talk about Factom increasing the data that is secured by the blockchain, not increasing the data sooted on the blockchain;  Factom will literally only store a tiny fixed amount of data (a Merkle root for near unlimited data secured and stored in Factom) on the blockchain in a transaction once every ten minutes.
Entries in Factom are organized into chains, which each have a name that is hashed to yield a chain ID.  So given a chain in Factom you can validate the entries, their order, time of submission... All backed by the blockchain.
Factom is built as a protocol layer to enable applications running on the blockchain in a way that does not throw up barriers to the data applications need to secure in form or volume, does not increase the size of blocks in Bitcoin, provides faster clearance time on entries, and lowers costs for entries.

Technically, Factoids (Factom's tokens) are an AppCoin.  An AppCoin represents a right to do something within an application.  In the case of Factoids, they represent the right to obligate the protocol.
Think of it this way.  The Federated Servers that run Factom have in some sense the ultimate right to use the Factom protocol since they are the ones doing all the work.  So they are awarded a fixed number of Factoids each day.  That fixed amount is determined by the sale, so how many is yet undetermined, but let's say that's 1000 Factoids.
The Federated Servers can sell that right to someone else for money.  So Factoids are tradable.
Somewhere along the way, someone would like to sell licenses that allow their customers to use the Factom Protocol.  Let's call this party a Factom Store.  So the Factom Store buys some Factoids to keep in their inventory.  When customers come to buy a "Factom License", the Factom Store converts Factoids to Entry Credits and assigns those Entry Credits to the public key(s) of their customer.
Entry Credits are not transferable.  So the customer in this case only gets to use their Entry Credits to write entries into Factom.  The customer cannot transfer these rights and they cannot convert them back into Factoids.  They are a pure software license to use the Factom protocol.
And so here is the answer to your question.  The Factom servers set the conversion rate of Factoids to Entry Credits.   They do so in a way that encourages use of the protocol, so the conversion rate maintains a steady price in dollars, independent of the price of a Factoid on the market.
If we assume the protocol will get a great deal of volume, then if Factoids go down in value, the use of the protocol will significantly reduce the supply of Factoids on the market.  The opposite is also true, that if Factoids are heavily valued, the use of the protocol will hardly reduce the supply of Factoids on the market at all.  
Thus the value of the Factoid is designed to reflect the value of the protocol, and the Factom Federated Servers are incentivized to maintain the Factom protocol in a manor that supports the value of the Factoids.

Having the records isn't enough;  You have to have validation of the records.  In many cases, the homeowners themselves had records they tried to use to defend themselves, but a homeowner can't really prove the records are valid.  They could if the records matched the signed hashes in a Factom Chain tied to the Mortgage.

It is a distributed protocol... Who gets an order to remove anything?
None the less, Factom is designed such that missing entry data doesn't stop the validation and verification (timestamping, order, blockchain proofs) of data in Factom.   So if you don't need the data as a user, you don't have to hold the data.
I expect some nodes will hold all the data, particularly the Federated Servers since doing so increases the value of the protocol, and that benefits the network.  But the fact that the network could be used to submit offensive or illegal data, Factom must work even if that data isn't present.

Where did I ever say Factom wasn't a data storage mechanism?  What I said was the purpose of Factom isn't as a data storage mechanism.  After all, we call Factom a general purpose data layer for the Bitcoin Blockchain.
But for the purpose of simply storing data, neither the Blockchain nor Factom is very compelling.  But use to back audits is pretty interesting.
This feels like an argument about nothing.  By providing a reasonable interface and reasonable cryptographic proofs, you can rely on the order and value of data recorded by Factom and backed by the Bitcoin Blockchain.  You can know use this data to audit all sorts of business processes very conveniently.  So using Factom as a verification and validation layer is natural.
But you can use Factom for other things as well.  Certainly.
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:16:27
Well, you can store raw data, which is ' point.  It is just that in most cases you will not.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:03:07
The problem solved is the ability to verify and validate data that spans multiple  "Systems of Record."   A System of Record is a computer system maintained usually by a centralized authority that parties agree maintains the system of record for a set of business processes.  This is about who holds the valid records.
So if each Mortgage was given a Factom Chain at inception, and as the Mortgage passed from company to company, the parties involved required 
1. Each company to maintain a cryptographic identity (could use any standard, i.e. Verisign or whatever), then 
2. Each record, statement, notice, or communication can be hashed, signed, and placed into the Factom chain.  
3. When a new company takes control of a mortgage, the new company can copy the records from previous parties, and can validate them.  This is because with Factom the destination company can ensure they have:
 - all the data, 
 - the signed validation of each data entry by the authority involved, and 
 - they are not missing any data.
The BOA (and several other big banks) got in trouble because systems of record went away.  Then there was no way to go back and validate the histories of all these loans, because you can't just move data from one system of record to another without some authority willing to ensure the data is valid and hasn't been changed and no collusion to construct a false history has occurred.   The second factor in their error is that they began to make assumptions about the data they didn't have, which is their own fault.
If each data element in a Mortgage had its own Factom entry, and each Mortgage had 10,000 entries, the total overhead to use Factom shared by all parties involved would be $10.  Factom makes it very cheap to coordinate processes that span systems of record in a non-fragile, trustless fashion.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:55:57
What is the magic of a fixed rate?
If I give you a 20 dollar coupon, does that give you a fixed rate of goods at a store?  No, though the dollar is pretty stable so it would seem like it.
I fully expect that Factoids will be pretty stable at some point, so they will seem pretty fixed rate too.  Just not at a launch.


Obviously most see buying Factoids as an investment opportunity.  But what is a Factoid?  It is nothing more than the right to obligate the protocol to write an entry.  That is quite literally what it is.  If the value of that right goes up, it feels like an investment.  But it remains what it is.

@_date: 2015-04-05 22:17:06
Because the chains need to be usable across corporate boundaries.  BOA will pay way more than 108 dollars a month as well.
Running servers and running a network and supporting applications as they come online isn't cheap. Providing portals into their private network to other parties that they will need to document actions they take on mortgages means security issues.  
And banks are fragmented.  BOA is comprised of all the banks they bought along the way.  Many systems of record, and costs accounting within each group.  So even figuring out how to deploy such a service isn't cheap.

The exact opposite of a bullet-proof guarantee would be a bullet-proof promise to destroy...  I am not making a straw man argument as much as blunting the implied assertion that Factom doesn't store data at all.
Factom is built to scale far beyond the data entry rate of Bitcoin.  As such, if full nodes (nodes able to validate commits and reveals) had to hold all the data, then very few people could run full nodes.  Look at Bitcoin, and the number of full nodes has been in decline for a while.  Much of it because of the weight of running a full node.   What Factom nodes will look like, and what will be required of them is still a matter of design.  But running a full node will not require holding all the data ever submitted to Factom.
The video.   I'll give you that point.  I spend a good bit of time making sure the people that make these videos do not claim Factom stores data.  Factom creates a verification and validation layer that will exist forever.  And if you have the data, you can thus validate your child's birth certificate as being the one submitted to Factom in the past.  If your jurisdiction accepts such validation, then you have quite a bit of value here.  We are talking to some governments to help them do this.
Lastly, I do think that many nodes for a long time will hold all the data.  And perhaps many nodes will always hold all the data.
It will only take one node holding your data to validate it against Factom.

Absolutely, that works great.  And we could go the traditional fund raising route too.  We would have preferred investors, and close the development.  And have closed source (Investors like that) and Patents (sells on Wall Street!)
The bottom line is that there ARE ways to do this traditionally so there are no tokens, no distributed protocols, centralized control, branding, and traditional fund raising and traditional stock.  And we could take Bitcoin! Wonderful!
We didn't go that route.  Obviously you can change any of the variables (open source with centralized control, or closed source but no patent crap, or takes Dollars but not Bitcoin, or Bitcoin and Litecoin, etc. etc.)  But a transparent, open source protocol, launched and distributed, and funded by the community happens to be the route we preferred.
I'm happy to talk about how we could do it better.  Oh and sure, if we had a big Angel willing to drop a few million on us as a donation we wouldn't have to fund raise in any way at all.  Didn't have the feathered guy.  Didn't even know a group of feathered people with deep enough pockets.

If there is an interest in maintaining a record of data to support the decisions being made, Factom is a good solution. This is why Factom will find some of its first uses in land title management.
Most of the time, it is expected that users will hash their data and place that hash into Factom. With the hashes in Factom, data can be validated and verified independent of where the data is obtained.  This data can also be grouped together.  A system like Factom can track mortgage histories to avoid data losses that result in fines such as what Bank of America paid a couple of years ago.  If all the records have a hash in a particular chain, and you have the data that matches the hashes, then you have all the data.  
Factom can be used to validate the rebuild of a system after it recovers from a significant failure. If you have all the data that matches the data in your disaster recovery chain, then you have all your data.  
Factom can be used to validate data held in one system where the system of record for that data is in another system.  A system publishing data can publish the hashes as well.  If a dependent system has all the data matching the hashes, it 1) knows it has the correct data, and 2) knows there is no additional data that it should get.
Factom does not just record data, but allows for its organization. Entries are added to Factom in Chains. A users will create their own Factom Chains and place entries into those chains. If a chain has been indicated as the chain for a Mortgage, then if the administrator fails to place a hash of a notice into the chain, this can be prove. Likewise if they did place a hash of a notice in the chain, they can prove that too.
So the idea is less about storing data, and more about knowing where the data came from, when it was added to Factom, and the order of all that data within the chains used by an application.
So why a token?
The reason Factom needs a token is to decentralize Factom.
A centralized solution has no problem taking Bitcoin as a payment, or any other kind of payment. They can hold the funds and distribute them as they wish. They can even form a standard corporate organization, and sell equity to raise funds, and distribute profits. Since they have a preferred position, they can leverage that to “make money” in all the traditional ways.
A decentralized solution cannot easily do these things. There is no central party to pay. There is no set of centralized parties to pay. There is no equity to sell, if it is truly decentralized like Bitcoin. But if the value of the protocol can be defined in some way that aligns the incentives of people to participate in the protocol, then one can create a decentralized application. In our case we chose to do this using a token.
The Factom protocol can issue “Factoids” to the Federated Servers that run the protocol because it is defined in the protocol, just like Bitcoin can issue Block Rewards to miners through the protocol. You can read more here: 
The Federated Servers are elected by the support of the users of the protocol. We will not be able to control who runs those servers. That is in the hands of the users of the protocol.  
Factom issues a fixed number of tokens over a year to the Federated Servers now and forever. That number is fixed by the Software Sale underway, and it is 20% of the Factoids sold in the sale. So if the sale sold 1000 Factoids (to make the math simple) then over a year the Federated Servers would be issued 200 Factoids.  Over the course of 5 years, the servers would be issued 1000 Factoids, so over time the servers gain most of the Factoids.
In that same 1000 Factoid sold scenario, the early purchasers would get 20 percent match of the Software Sale, or 200 Factoids. And the early contributors (~40 people) would share 30 percent of the Software Sale, or 300 Factoids.
The Software Sale of Factoids does two things: (1) It does raise money for the Factoid Foundation. The Factoid Foundation will be working to support and maintain the protocol.  And (2) it distributes the initial tokens across a broad range of people; there is no large concentration of Factoids even in the very beginning with any one person person, organization, or company.
Factom is designed to have the Factoid represent the value of the protocol. With a fixed number of Factoids issued to the Factom Servers, the flow out of the ecosystem is determined by how much the protocol is used. With greater use, Factoids are more scarce and their price may rise. With less use, Factoids are more abundant, and the price may fall.
All the software we are developing is open source. We use Github for development, and we have documented our ideas as we developed them. Our organization is as transparent as we can be, finanicially, technically, and even socially. We host a local Bitcoin meetup group in our offices every Tuesday in Austin Texas.
We are always happy to discuss what we are doing and why. And we hope to engage the Liberty community more in the future.
Honesty is subversive. If we can make immutable audits the standard for government and business, this may be the most significant social reform in history.

So now you are going to blame Factom for a legal paradox?  How does using Verisign's timestamping facility (which I can't find any information on) solve this problem?  Or Dropbox?
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:42:26
Each Federated Server creates a Factom Chain that documents both their identity, and the public key they will use to write anchors to the Bitcoin Blockchain.  The concept is more complex than that (see the [Consensus Paper]( which we keep on [Github]( for more details.  
So there is no single centralized database, but rather a ledger that comes to consensus over a set of federated servers.  Each with their own identity, and their own bitcoin keys.

No.  You are a server, so you fall under DCMA rules.   This isn't about "clever mitigation."  At least not in the US.

But an audit program shouldn't look at data that isn't signed, and it should define what valid signatures are required.  If code is going to use data as inputs, it either must 1) harden where the data comes from, or 2) harden the handling of potential malicious data.  
This just isn't a problem unique to Factom.  But perhaps it is unique to business processes designed to be auditable without trusted third parties managing the books. 
Honesty might be better, but it might not always be easier.


A malicious *third* party, not an authorized party, should not be able to insert data into your chain that you can't disregard as spurious.  The obvious requirement is that legitimate parties properly sign their data, and you disregard unsigned data.
Malicious customers are already a problem, so that isn't anything new.




No.  The hash of the entry is in the old entry block.  You don't need the chain, only the entry block and the entry itself.  You can still validate with just the entry and knowing the old chain.


Not. At. All.  You keep thinking that nobody can prove misbehavior when such misbehavior cannot be denied in an immutable set of ledgers!  If anyone claims a record isn't valid when it is, the record still remains.  Nobody gets to erase it.




I can't even follow what you are trying to say.  So a user has a Factom chain where they really need the data.  Some of that data is legitimate AND illegal.  So the user can't what... get rid of the data they need?  Must get rid of data they have to have?
Any party that isn't using the chain has no problem dropping the data.  
Any party that isn't legitimately engaged on the chain shouldn't be able to create valid entries, if the chain is properly constructed.
And nothing here is unique to Factom.  If this was Bitcoin, nobody could do anything about the data.  At least with Factom you can.  Something kinda important for general purpose data.




Servers can wait for DCMA.  Users can keep their chains if they want them, even if it isn't legal in some jurisdictions.  
Not really seeing your point.




Users of Factom will still want data preserved.  All "old" users have to do is preserve their data;  it will continue to validate even if they are the only ones holding the data.  Federated Servers will want Factom to be used as much as possible.  Making Factom reliable is good for business.  And users will want a reliable protocol.
I am not seeing where the incentives flow the other way.  Entries could be lost over time, but this is also true for all alternatives.  Even Bitcoin will eventually have to prune data if it were to scale.




This is all about using [Microsoft's File Signing Tool (Signcode.exe) shipped with the .NET platform](  You cannot create a chain of entries, nothing prevents multiple signed versions of your data (that you reveal at your leisure) and even if you are sharing your timestamped data in real time with another party, a 3rd party will not be able to tell if the two parties are colluding together when they later look at a timestamped history.
A significant part of trusted timestamping is proof of publication, which this batch file does not resolve.

When you consider what government should do to catch crime, you don't have a slippery slope as much as a muddy field riddled with sink holes.   The US has a terrible history of abusive laws.  Heck, a cryptocurrency company in Botswana is supposed to get a Bit License if they have one New York customer!  
I think you raise a good point.  If the Blockchain Alliance is made up of only those companies that see no problem with government over reach, then who within that group can step up and talk about it?  To speak up for fungibility?

Entry Credits are not "bought", but rather you convert Factoids into entry credits (regardless of what server records the transaction).  Entry Credits then are tied to a particular public/private key pair, and messages signed with those keys can create entry chains, and add entries.


Well, you can identify an economic utility for Factoids.  They are converted into entry credits which let you write data into Factom.   If 100 million entries were going into Factom at a .1 cent each per year, then the available factoids have to hold enough value for those conversions into Entry Credits.   Only 73K factoids are generated per year, so on average 73k Factoids would need to be worth roughly $1.36.   Otherwise (if Factoids are under valued by speculators) the supply of factoids would drop.   Or if over valued, the supply of factoids would rise.
The point is, there is an economic value for factoids. And the Factoids paid to the servers should balance the value placed into the protocol.


How does that work in a distributed protocol, where you cannot identify who will be a server and who will not?   How do you distribute funds across the servers?  And if servers sell obligations, then bail, how do you then meet the obligations?
I went down that road in designing this system, and couldn't make it work without a very complex set of bonds on servers controlled by complex multisig transactions....  And then there were failure scenarios I could not resolve.   The token is a far simpler and straight forward solution.
And by burning fees and sinking Factoids into Entry Credits (with no reward to servers) the only way for servers to increase the value of their reward is to promote the protocol.  And speculators get averaged out by the flexibility of the system to increase and decrease the supply as it deviates from the natural value of the token.


The servers are elected by those purchasing Entry Credits.  And the only reason to make those purchases is to place data into Factom.   Nobody can simply arbitrarily run a server without support from those using the protocol.   And speculators (simply by holding factoids) do not have any vote.  So unless the servers are willing to actually write data into the protocol by converting factoids into entry credits, they have no special ability to put servers into play.


Tierion provides proof of existence using a centralized service.  Factom allows users to create entry chains, allowing proof not only of the existence of a document, but proof of a chain of documents over time.   Proof of process if you will.   Furthermore, Factom will be a decentralized autonomous protocol, that is censorship resistant.   Users cannot be booted from the protocol, and do not have to agree to any terms of service.


We do not think so, but I would be quick to point out there are many, many use cases for platforms like Tierion.  And if Terion wanted to, they should be able to run on Factom without any impact on their own business model or on their customers.  And with Factom, I believe they could add many, many features that would be hard to do without a generalized protocol like Factom.

I am hesitant to make a post I cannot commit the resources to properly support, and I am not in a position to make a statement.  But you rightly identify one of the tricky aspects of the Internet and a global payment system:  we don't agree world wide on what crimes are, and what catching them entails.
Snowden and the Internet are revealing and publishing the abuses of our trust by those that supposedly should protect us.  Which is more reason for someone to interface with these groups and figure stuff out.  Heck, the Tor network (from the Navy I believe) is one of the key technologies that Silk Road used.   It is really hard to use tech to aid whistle blowers and dissidents you like when the tech also helps drug dealers and whistle blowers you don't like.
I'm not smart enough to solve these problems.
One of the points the government people made was that black lists could destroy the fungibility of the protocol, and how that actually damages cases against real criminals.  I do believe if the government abuses the protocol, the tech will move to protocols and tech that resist inspection.

Joining the blockchain alliance doesn't necessarily indicate approval for blacklists.  At the DOJ digital currency conference in San Francisco last week, put on in cooperation with the blockchain alliance, the idea of blacklisting was rejected by nearly all parties (FBI, IRS, homeland security, exchanges, wallet companies, etc.).  The point everyone made is that $100 dollar bills have the same histories, yet we trade them.
If Bitcoin are stolen, then there is a legitimate need to identify the thieves.  If terrorists use Bitcoin, then OK.  I think we want to identify drug gangs, and human trafficking, kidnappers, extortionists... There are plenty of bad things most in the community would like stopped.
Increasingly legalized sales of pot? Not so much.  Attacks on wikileaks?  Or political actions?  Evasion of capital controls?  Taxation?  All of us have concerns where we oppose at least some of the efforts of various states to enforce capital controls, and crack down on some activities.  This includes everyone in the alliance, because they oppose many states themselves!
So realistically it is insane even for libertarians to claim that bitcoin organizations should boycott such groups and leave enforcement in the dark.
BTW, I did attend that conference, and at one point got more than a few laughs and knowing nods when I pointed out that the biggest money tumbler/mixer today is the traditional financial system.

I actually believe that Factom will provide permanent storage in most cases.  However, it may be that servers will pay some incentives out to nodes to insure redundancy in the future.
Factom was designed to provide proofs for Entries and Entry Chains independent of any other data.  Because it's principle value is providing a means of validating and verifying the existence and order of entries in entry chains.  If someone wants to insert Child Porn into Factom, nodes have no obligation to maintain that data, and dropping that data will have no impact on the rest of the system.
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:32:05
The other ways of stuffing data into the Bitcoin Blockchain do create bloat in the single ledger that is Bitcoin.
Factom is creating a multi-chain system designed for verification and validation that is secured by the Bitcoin Blockchain directly.
Users don't have to look through all the data in Factom to find their data, and then they can access the cryptographic proof from their data to the Bitcoin Blockchain.
This not only doesn't bloat the Bitcoin Blockchain, but it even avoids users from wading through all the data in Factom too.
While we might have an advantage to reduce bloat on Bitcoin's Blockchain, the VALUE of factom comes from its utility.  No amount of "reducing bloat" is going to make a useless protocol valuable.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:02:29

No.  Access to your data is free, because the cost of accessing the entries can be distributed over the network. 
The data is validated by the directory blocks and entry blocks which are relatively small.  So just like bittorrent, any source at all can supply the data, because you can validate it against the hashes... Bad data can't propigate over the network.

Selling entry credits obligates protocol to write data into Factom in the future... How do you decide who gets to sell these entry credits?  If you have a centralized system, then that's easy.  The guys running it.  But in a decentralized system you need to earn that right.  How do we track that?  With the token.
The token is awarded to the servers that do the work of recording entries.  And they can sell entry credits until they run out of factoids, the tokens.  Or, if they don't like trying to sell entry credits, they can sell the factoids on the market and let someone else "run the store", so to speak.  If a server drops out, than the server that takes its place earns the factoids.  But the former server still has the right to sell entry credits if it still has tokens.
Without the token managing who has the right to grant access, then one server might earn way more than a server doing more work, simply because it sold more.  How do you stop that from happening without a token?




Yes.  Your past data is secure.  But you might be dropped from their service if they so chose to do so. Being on the blockchain does not force them to record your data. That is their right, as it is their service.  But if you build mission critical apps on Teirion, you might be concerned.
Factom cannot block users without such actions being obvious. The design calls for 32 servers ultimately, and censorship would require all to censor.   Not a likely proposition. 
If Factom's performance, price, and features prove to be compelling, Teirion can even use Factom if they like.  Factom is designed so that to deny anyone access to the protocol would be very, very, very unlikely.

One of the main goals of Factom is to secure data using bitcoin's proof of work without increasing load on bitcoin's blockchain.  With factom's design, the accounting for entries and payment is in Factom, not Bitcoin.  So even if thousands of entries are written into Factom, no additional transactions are added to bitcoin's blockchain.
Now if you purchase entry credits with Bitcoin, that reduces most of this load.  But you have created a debt of sorts for future servers.  How do you make that fair without a token?
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:14:15
But even then, you have no way to track those numbers if the money is traded between people and institutions that are not paying attention.  Once they go into a cash register, who knows who made the purchase?

Factoids represent a tradable right to use the protocol.  The original supply was set by the crowd sale.  Once the full protocol is running, factoids will be issued at a fixed rate to the servers that run the protocol.
For now, until the protocol is completely deployed, no new factoids are issued.
To use the protocol, factoids are converted to entry credits.  And those are used to write to the protocol.  And once used, the right is gone.  The right is generated by those parties running the protocol, and is ended by those using the protocol.
My simulations show that the value of the protocol (what people are paying to write into Factom) will drive the value of the token.  If the protocol is worthless, so will be the token.  If the protocol is valuable, so the token will be as well.
That's because the token is exactly what we say it is, a tradable right to obligate the protocol.  
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:35:15


Factom runs over a set of servers, so no one server can censor your application.  Furthermore, as a user of the protocol, you can withdraw your support from servers that are not performing, lend support to servers that earn your trust, etc.
So there is no one to one server user mapping in Factom.
 &gt; That the value of that service will depend on any given servers load and capacity to serve such requests.  I see no need to 'delegate' this right to others.  (essentially selling futures on services that you may not be able to service when the time comes)
Servers need to monetize their efforts to pay their bills.  The token expands the options for doing so in a distributed system that allows for the flow of servers into and out of service.


Centralized systems incur risk not found in decentralized systems.  Risk of provider failure, censorship, regulation, liability, etc.


You have a point, though fractional reserve banking creates a debt of to customer to the bank, and that isn't happening here.  Instead, speculation can increase or decrease the factoid supply to damp pump and dump attacks automatically in Factom.


Okay, I hope this helps.
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:20:44
If you purchase 2000 factom tokens (Factoids) you will own 2000 tokens.  As the sale isn't limiting the number of Factoids sold, a "percentage of ownership" can only be defined at the end of the software sale.  However, this itself is only a transient measure.
When Factom is fully launched, Factom will be generating new Factoids and paying them to the servers, and as the protocol is used, Factoids leave the system in the form of Entry Credits and Entries.
At no point in time is a "percentage of ownership" a meaningful concept.

Most of the data is held in the entries, and technically not all entry data is needed to run a federated server.  However, the value of the network depends on having that data, so the servers (which get paid in as much as the protocol is used) are highly motivated to make data available.

Bitcoin turns trasparency upside down.  In the traditional Financial system, the larger the actor, the more accounts, institutions, transactions, and jurisdictions are involved. In other words, the bigger you are, the more Anonymous you are. On the other hand, you as an individual have nearly no privacy. Because,  unless you're somebody like Bill Gates, you likely have only a handful of accounts at Banks and financial institutions, and they're all within one maybe two jurisdictions.
Because the Block Chain is a permanent record of all transactions, the effect is completely the other way around. The fewer transactions you make the more Anonymous you are. But a big Institution (such as a terrorist group, drug ring, prostitution ring, extortion ring, excetera excetera excetera) makes Many many transactions. And the Ledger is public. So all law enforcement has to do, is inject the few transactions into such an organization. Then just Trace where the bitcoin goes.  A few trasactions, a few compromised suppliers and participants, and you have cryptographic proof and the bad guys go to jail.
I went to a conference, where I heard a guy from the FBI point out they have been way more effective enforcing the law when Bitcoin is involved, then when transactions are solely made through the traditional Financial Network.
In summary, we do have mixers in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space which can be used to disguise who owns what coins. But the best most effective mixers in the entire world for hiding where money comes from and where money goes are the traditional financial institutions.

Factoids are converted into entry credits.
All the servers record all the entries.  Of course, they should have the right to sell entry credits.  But doing so obligates every server... So how do you distribute such rights?  How do you transfer those rights to parties that would like to sell entry credits?

Factom seeks to secure data using Bitcoin's proof of work.  Additionally Factom records that data using user defined named chains.
* Identities
* Audit trails
* Meta protocols (like Counterparty)
* Document management
* Settlement
* Anything that can leverage a public ledger
* Can be achored into multiple chains
* Cheaper (1/10 cent for 1k of data using Factom vs as much as $3 or more for direct Bitcoin transactions)
* All transaction accounting is segregated away from data
* User chains have independent proofs
* Scalable  
Factom has many, many use cases, so it's far from a one trick pony.  The company is building the first of these applications, but I'd expect many other companies to follow.

So how does that work?  They accept a payment in "not Bitcoin" using a pSPV wallet, then pay someone "not Bitcoin" who uses a SPV wallet, where "not Bitcoin" becomes "Bitcoin" again?
And nevermind that all current SPV wallets are, by your definition, pSPV wallets best I know...  So only a handful of real Bitcoin users have ever existed? 
And do I count?  I use coinbase to buy, and move to paper wallets.  I don't get any of the proofs you want in an SPV wallet or even a pSPV wallet that way.

We always represented the token as a software license.  
@_date: 2015-10-16 03:09:51
The simulations show the token to be tied to the value of the protocol.  
That's the point.  Create incentives so that those that run the protocol are rewarded if and only if the protocol is valuable.
If that is taking advantage of drunks.... I don't see that, but okay...

You and I went over the mechanics of how Factoids flow into and out of the available supply.   I do not recall you ever objecting to the methodology I used in the simulations.  But just to recap, I'll give a summary of Factom's architecture:
Quite simply there is a fixed number of factoids that will be paid to the servers (roughly 73000 per month).  However, every use of the protocol requires factoids to leave the available supply since factoids are converted to entry credits, which are reduced as entries are written into the protocol.  Also, all fees live the supply;  they are not paid to the servers.
Lastly, the exchange rate of factoids to entry credits is set by the servers, meaning entry credits can always cost a fixed amount, roughly .001 dollars per entry credit.
So the simulations collected a handful of assumptions (so that one could manipulate the use of the protocol, the price of the token, the degree of speculation, number and degree of "pump and dump" attacks, etc.).  It then modeled the supply of tokens, price discovery over the resulting supply and demand curves, the feedback of the token exchange rate, and mapped the effects over time.
Over all sets of assumptions tested, the token price was shown to trend to the value of the protocol (measured in the volume of entries at a dollar price written into the protocol).
If the value of factoids in exceeds what factoids go out, then the supply of factoids will increase, pushing the price down.
If the value of factoids going out exceeds what factoids are coming in, then the supply of factoids will decrease, pushing the price of factoids up.
Thus (as one would hope for an appcoin) the value of the token will reflect the value of the protocol, and is resistant to speculation over the long term.
**tl;dr**:  Here is a simple explanation of the methodology used, and note the approach shows an extreme lack of Mercury in retrograde. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:43:16
The argument about how funding for projects should be managed is a meta argument that (I think) is rather out of scope.  
The Implementation of Factoids/Entry Credits is very important too, which you may not grasp if you haven't also read the consensus paper.  The idea is to completely separate the accounting and incentives of the servers that manage the protocol from the users of the protocol and their data.
Users of the protocol never have to touch a Factoid.  Users can simply buy Entry Credits (which are non-transferable) from a Factom store for a steady real world price over time.  
So Factom provides a very simple protocol that allows users access to Bitcoin blockchain security with these features:
*  Arbitrary data -- Defined by your application
*  Separate Accounting -- Factoids and Entry Credits are managed separately from the data you are adding to Factom
* Censorship resistance --  The commitment to write an entry is made (in the accounting side of Factom) prior to revealing the entry (in the data side of Factom).  
* User defined Factom Chains -- Your applications can not only prove existence, but also the negative (an entry does NOT exist within your chains)
* Very simple API -- Only requires a handful of calls 
* Provides proofs for all data against the Bitcoin Blockchain 
* A Factom Chain has a proof independent of all other Factom Chains
* Factom is decentralized, so no central point of failure
* Factom provides incentives that keep the protocol working as systems are added to and/or are removed from the protocol
*  Factom can secure arbitrarily large sets of entries using Bitcoin's Blockchain without destabilizing Bitcoin's incentives
* Writing data into Factom is cheaper and faster
* Moving timestamped data to Factom from directly writing to the Bitcoin Blockchain can dramatically reduce bloat in Bitcoin
* Factom can be scaled to handle very very large transaction volumes
And there are more.  If you would like to join the discussion of Factom and its designs, send me contact info via PM and we will include you.

Well, you are the expert on the headers and their use, so we'll rework that section in the white paper.
The biggest reason we are not using the header the anchors in the headers is that we do not see how it can be done reliably and transparently using headers or ChronoBit.   We do know how to write transactions with OP_RETURN, and how to iterate over all OP_RETURN entries in Bitcoin that are written by anyone ever.  
We have many problems to solve to make Factom real.  We ABSOLUTELY want to transition to using Bitcoin headers once our tech goes live.

To open a channel, you have to pay the fee.  To close a channel, you need to pay a fee.  Additionally, if the other side of a channel doesn't cooperate to close a channel, you wait a week for settlement.
So fees over couple bucks just to buy small things doesn't make sense.  Particularly if the network is small and not vetted in the market place.
So high fees exaggerate the chicken and egg problem where the network isn't valuable until there are many channels, but you don't get many channels unless the network is valuable.  
If fees are 25 cents, who cares?  Make a 3 dollar channel and see it works.  You might be out 50 cents.  If fees are $3 and might go up to $5, then you have to pay $3 to spend $3 and maybe you can't even close the channel?

Really?  How are you defining honesty?
I am defining honesty as requiring cryptographic signatures to move value;  nobody can move value out of one's control without that person's permission (via their keys).
I am also defining honesty as allowing cryptographic audits of transactions by default.
In this case, I am also defining an honest system as one with a track record of catching crooks.

I can't make any official statements, as I am not involved directly with the Blockchain Alliance.
However I really do wish the community would not react in fear.   Bitcoin adoption means that more than libertarians and anarchists have to see an advantage in the protocol.   If more processes used blockchains and cryptographic authority, then processes could be more honest.
The huge advantage of Bitcoin is the fact that Honesty is Subversive.  We really can do better with math...

Channels will not last forever; if too much value is pushed in one direction, closing makes sense because you can't use it if pushing the money no longer get  helps you pay for things . Or the other side, there are no payments being routed away from you.
If the other side isn't responsive.
If you need the funds in the channel for non LN payments.

Channels will close more frequently than one closes bank accounts.  I've not closed a bank account in years, but on a lightning network, I'd expect some freqency of opening and closing channels.
And no, I wouldn't go broke if i viewed a channel as costing 6 bucks.  But if I wanted to hold on average 20 channels, at a $3 fee, that's a cost of ($3 (to open) + $3 (to close)) x 20 = $120
At a fee of 25 cents, that same setup costs $10.
Is it easier to build a large network where you are asking people to join at $120?  Or at $10?
Is your marketing slogan really going to be, "Hey, you won't go broke!"?

We need the 32 byte hash of a new block to begin hashing a new block.  Nothing stops us from setting up a full node near any major source of hash power, validating new valid blocks, and broadcasting the 32 byte hash to everyone of any completed block we see. Followed by the header, then followed by the block.
Any miner could get a head start hashing, then validate the block for themselves when they get it.  We might get some additional empty blocks, but the payoff advantage of being near where the solution is found could be minimized.
If a miner is running the embedded node, it could also build the new block, and transmit it's hash to the Miner's hashing operation. Then block size would not matter much, and no increase of empty blocks.
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:37:32
Factoids provide incentives for servers to run Factom as a decentralized protocol.  They also limit spam (as a fee is required to write an entry.)
You can buy entry credits which are not a tradable token and use the protocol.  You don't have to buy or use factoids.
Factom is open source, but the network follows certain rules.  The value of using Factom is in the network effects that will grow out of parties using Factom.

Looking over Bitcoin's node numbers (there are a few sites like [Coin Dance]( and [bitnodes]( .
The obvious conclusion to me is that we have more nodes if the price of Bitcoin goes up, and fewer if the price goes down.  Not really seeing even a correlation between block size and node participation.  But a direct relationship between block size and node participation seems to be an assertion pushed by many.  Even if the assertion isn't obvious in the data.

Seems apt.  On both sides of this debate.

Crypto has all sorts of utility beyond just currency.  Immutable distributed public ledgers are massively useful for time-stamping, messaging between parties, audit trails, data integrity, and more.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:12:07








Or the stock market since forever.  
Crypto is young, but you are disregarding quite a bit of analysis that suggests distributed ledgers are here to stay.
BTW, Homes don't really have a price floor.  A new three bedroom house built in Walkitia, OK sold for $10,000 after the crash.  Plenty of examples in other areas.  Sure, I'd say there is always a floor, but that might be orders of magnitude below prices paid in many cases.


The reverse is also true, that people DO accept lower real wages, as long as there is a rise in nominal wages.  Is it any wonder the financial sector .(~8% of GDP) corners 35% of corporate profits?  That owners face growing real returns while wages are flat or even falling?


 Bitcoin's value will not be going at those rates when universally adopted.  How could it?  There would be no money flowing in to justify the higher price (since the current rise in value is driven by dollars flowing in).
What would happen is people earn flat real wges that rise in value over time.  Businesses would have lowering costs due to Technology, but slightly flling labor costs (since new hires need not have the same pay as established workers).
As long as the rise in Bitcoin value is tied to productivity, Bitcoin would drive wages back to workers.


I absolutely understand the self serving (to the financial sector) the importance of monetary theory.  Deflation is bad because people and businesses can hold value without the financial network getting a cut.  There is no economic downside to the actual production of goods and services to businesses and workers of increasing and decentralisation of wealth and buying power of the market.




I'm confident you are just as biased from having passed on holding your bitcoin as I might be from holding some.   And I'd not be so confident of your early awareness, though you did buy before me (my first purchase was for 72 cents).  I noticed you passed on claiming any development.
I viewed the real value of the distributed ledger and proof of work as enabling a vast distributed system for establishing data integrity.  Which is why I established Factom.
Bitcoin can't scale to replace the dollar any time soon.  But the idea of building cryptographic backed business processes, and building reserves of value backed by cryptographic proofs will radically change everything.  I believe for the better.

I could have pointed to vastly deprecated markets.  And you are taking my statements out of context to make a point.  Congrats.
 &gt;Im saying the housing MARKET has a floor because the government wont let them fall below a certain level, and again housing is a consumption good(durable) in economic terms, thus making shelter(housing) always commanding a price, unlike bitcoin who has none.
Like the government enforced prices under Carter?  Or came close to a total  meltdown in 2008?  The government isn't always able to fix everything.  
Crypto currency will have a floor when it is integral to business.  Maybe not as easy to understand as shelter, but real none the less.  Not saying it's there yet.






   
Bitcoin is unlikely to serve as a currency, but if it did, with maybe a billion users, it would be stable.






It's how money is constantly devalued to shift rewards from wage earners to owners.what we have seen for the last 40 years.




Name a stock you owned and sold that did as well as Bitcoin, as radical, as new, and as isolated from standard investment wisdom?




Why would I?  Bitcoin gave up the payment rail use case by restricting transctions and allowing a fee market to price it out.
That doesn't mean cryptocurrencies as a while are so constrained, nor that other layers might solve the transaction rate/cost problem.

No not really.  Every channel needs two possible transactions to build and possibly tear down the channel.  That takes room on the blockchain.  I've not read an estimate required to support 100 million users, much less a billion.  You will still need significant space over a MB on the blockchain to scale out a lightning network.
And nodes will need to stay online to be safe.  So significant cloud infrastructure is needed.

My views don't hinge on Bitcoin's success as a currency.  The value comes from many aspects besides currency.

You may have the last word.   
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:34:41
That's some serious magic.  To open a channel requires one transaction.  So for seven billion people to.open 2 channels each requires seven billion transactions minimum (where nobody has more than two channels).
So your statement asserts you can do 7 billion bitcoin transactions in 140 MB?  Not terribly likely.  Maybe that's the daily requirement once channels are established?  Seems terribly low as well.  
And what if there is a "run" on the blockchain to close channels?  You have to maintain enough space of a significant number of channels to close within the safety period to be secure.  Is that 10%?  20%?  I dont know.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:01:42


The utility of metal currencies always paled to their speculative price.


Define "stability in price".  Then we can measure what that means. If you mean cryptocurrencies have increased too much in value, then maybe price stability is overrated.


Of course.  And I've made significant purchases with cryptos.  Does being an owner, user, and developer of crypto technology disqualify me as a supporter?  If so, does a lack of ownership disqualify one as a detractor?  Do you own any? Use any?  Done any development? If not, are you trying to justify yourself?   
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:50:07
No, they are locked for what, 1000 blocks?  On average that's a week.   If the other side goes dark, your BTC is locked up for a week + however long you wait for the other side to wake up before you give up and close the channel. 
If the other side is nice, they give you the secret  and you can close immediately.  But otherwise you wait.  
And to close, you have to pay the current transaction fee.  If it's really high, and there isn't much in the channel, then you might just lose the value.  Because it isn't refeemable., It isn't secure, and the network isn't likely to use it.

What you neglect is that lightning must launch first.  
Fees go down AFTER the network exists.  As things stand , Bitcoin needs Litecoin to launch a lightning Network.
In the meantime the vast majority of transactions today are done on the  exchanges. Payment processors like coinbase are handling transactions between parties off blockchain. 
 Lightning will have to compete with other solutions too.  So despite the devotion to the ideal by many, we can't claim we have a solution until we actually have a solution in place.  Until then, other options are developing, and Bitcoin will have to compete.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:57:13
Not a solution that works for the problem we are talking about, since lighting 1) won't be live in August,  and 2) You still need a transaction to start a lighting channel.
High fees will beget a chicken and egg problem for lightning on Bitcoin.  Vanishingly few people will pay for a channel to be created and lock up their Bitcoin if that's very expensive unless the network is valuable. But the network will not be valuable unless many
 many people have created channels.
Lightning also has legal issues. Technically under today's law, participants in lightning network will need a money transmission license if they consistently  money between parties. Also every Bitcoin transaction under current IRS law is a tax event. So until we get certain reforms passed at the federal level to create uniform tax policies, and exemptions from money transmission license requirements,  lightning network is a great idea, but still a solution that's years away from solving Bitcoin scalability issues.
Sadly, lightning has a greater chance of solving Bitcoin scalability issues by moving transactions on to some other more agile, inexpensive chain like Litecoin.  
An interesting solution might be a multi chain lightning Network that allows some channels to exist on other chains, and some channels exist on bitcoin. Hadn't really thought about that but maybe it would work.

Being an immutable ledger has nothing to do with it's exchange utility. 
Chronic volatility is due to being a tiny market, relatively speaking.  But even huge assets could crash... If someone dumped 20% of Google's stock, it'd tank too.  Just easier to do with crypto due to relatively small market caps, multiple exchanges, and ease of trading.

But channels won't last forever.  There will be a breakdown rate (to recover locked funds from unresponsive channels, to reallocate to more useful channels, to liquidate ones holdings, etc.).
You have to support that rate plus support everyone using Bitcoin for settlement, for store of value, for on chain purchases, for exchanges, etc.
In other words, there is no room today for LN.  And even 8 mb + LN will not scale to 100 million everyday users of small purchases.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:35:25
Except launching the lightning network isn't very possible with high Fees and restricted transactions, since building and tearing down channels will still take space on the blockchain.  
If it costs $10 to build a channel by a customer to buy coffee (whatever the cost to build AND tear down a channel, since you can't expect Starbucks to pay half the costs, plus some in case fees go up), why use a channel?  Gift cards are cheaper.

But won't be a solution that works in August for the problem we are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:02:00
To close a channel without cooperation of the other side takes.a week.  And you only get the advantage of many transactions for a channel when the network is flushed out. Until then you're paying $10 to transact with just the other side of the channel and may be one or two parties it's connected to.
As I said, the way to get around this is for multi chain lightning Networks, perhaps built on etherium and Litecoin as well as Bitcoin , or centralized third parties like coin base, bitpay, banks, etc. 
And all of this assumes that lightening networks are can even be made to be legal. Currently, money service business in money transfer business laws would apply. And that kills the network in the United States, where the vast majority of financial investment for Bitcoin exists.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:24:47
Oh I have no arguments with 140 MB blocks, but that's way beyond what can be done in the current environment...
And it might not be enough.  Consider a run on the network.  Is there a bottleneck possible that could result in high Fees, a locked network, and losses o funds?
I think at least 10% of all channels need to be able to be closed within a week.  Maybe more.  And stable fees are required, or channels could be frozen out.

To summarize, as more people wish to use a constrained resource, fees are used to decide who has access and who doesn't.  
Many use cases are excluded if fees are too high.  One such use case is payments.  High Fees eliminate the"pay for a coffee" use, unless payments are done off chain.  The only way to use Bitcoin reasonably today for small purchases is through trusted third parties (banks, payment processors).  Coinbase for example.  Or Bitcoin backed credit cards.
Lightning is a distributed solution.
Lightning requires the fee to set up a channel.  Most of the time, a user will need to pay for the channel AND it's resolution up front.  $1-2 becomes $2-4.  It could be higher.  Nobody will want many channels unless it is valuable.  And it isn't valuable unless there are many channels.
So while we might suppose that off chain transactions can easily handle the payment use case, fees remain a barrier.
Strangely, Litecoin (and other alts) may help if the Lightning Network is multichain.  As it is a shift of value between parties, nothing says it can't pass through a range of channels, shifting different "values".  And those could be Litecoin, Ethereum, whatever.
This makes the network valuable, and makes the fees to set up and tear down more bearable...

Let's assume 1 byte transactions. (Not 450 to 600 bytes as is the average).
14,000,000,000 == 140 x 1024 x 1024 == 146,800,640?
You are off by many orders of magnitude!
Let's be realistic .  Bitcoin can do about 2200 and change trasactions per block.  We get ideally 144 blocks per day.  Assuming Bitcoin  can devote 1000 trasactions per 1 MB block to onboarding, it will take:
1,000,000,000/1000/144/365 = 19 years to onboard 1 billion people, assuming they would pay the 20 to 50 dollar fees x 2 and never close a channel.

Only Bitcoin's value and success drives the value of other tokens/blockchains/technologies/payment rails.  Alts have not risen in value at Bitcoin's expense, nor the reverse.
But let's revisit the term "altcoin".
Some Bitcoin maximalists have been known lately to refute Bitcoin's role as a payment rail for every day purchases... If bitcoin is only a store of value, and a means to move large amounts of value, then obviously other coins (like litecoin) will be needed to serve as a payment rail, and do not compete with Bitcoin.
They are no longer "alternative" coins, but a "complementary" coins.
Bitcoin can't abandon a fundamental role like payments and at the same time refer to blockchains attempting to serve a payment role as "alternative".
