I often think to myself - I never win anything, so why bother?
Sometimes, rationality wins out, and I realize, I never win anything because I never bother.
So, what the heck. Hash goes in hat.

Looks like you're a little short.

I haven't spent the first bit, though I don't have all that much just yet. 0.21 BTC with 0.06272 still pending.
Not even close to a full bitcoin yet, but it's getting there, little by little. I will probably start increasing my buys soon. I buy about $25 at a time, but will either double or quadruple that.
I am glad to see that BTC is seeing more and more acceptance and accessibility, though I think we've still got a bit farther to go before it's ubiquitous, though it has come quite a long way in the last couple of years. Has any currency seen this fast an adoption rate? I'd say the Euro, but that was pretty much forced on people, whereas BTC has been a wholly voluntary adoption.

I just get 'insufficient funds'. :/
But, whatever. I just bought some more anyway. Viva BTC!

This has been my strategy. I buy a set amount every couple of weeks and hold onto it. I'm not in it to make money. I see it as a form of savings that I'm far less likely to pull from when things get tight.

Shave and a hair cut - 2588 bits has a nice ring to it.

I was offered a job with BitPay, unfortunately, it came out of the blue, and I was not at all prepared for it, so I had to pass it up. :( Ever since then, all I see is news about them expanding.

USAA has had that for a while. Great feature.

The fundamental difference, Mr. "Federal" Reserve, is that Bitcoin makes US the bankers. You can go suck lemons... Or Dimons, I don't particularly give a damn which.

Old to me. Don't I wish it was some 'old' hoard of a few hundred btc from 2009.

I followed [this advice]( I'm afraid I can't help beyond that. Perhaps someone more experienced with the subject?

Imagine that, banks complaining about high fees. *rolleyes* Welcome to the club, assholes.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:47:05
I'm just talking about $20-$25 buys now and then. I'd buy more now, but I can't afford to throw down for a big buy at the moment.
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:13:09
Took your advice, and bought some. Not much, but a small amount that I could easily repeat on a regular basis.
Tired of kicking myself, just going to buy regularly and hodl.
I'd done that before, but ended up having to cash out because of some financial difficulties. After that, I fell out of the habit and life got busy.
Just as anyone else here might, I've thought countless times about how easily I could have racked up a good amount of BTC back when it was really cheap and not many people were taking it seriously.
Ah well. Until I can invent a time machine...

Where I live, they've been building an elevated and segregated roadway where people can avoid the traffic and gridlock... For a fee.
Something, something, high TX fees with BTC right now. *shrug*

Ok, that's so damned spot on, I'm looking over my shoulder now. :{

Reminds me of Philip K Dick's Ubik. Everything costs money. Can't pay your door? Can't leave your house.

I own $40.22 in bitcoin. Here's my story:
I'm fucking broke.
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:59:17
Sorry guys - My fault - I bought some bitcoin. This always happens. :/
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:57:19
Well, I'm now situated with a bitcoin wallet.
I have no real idea what I'm doing, but I'll learn.. RTFM!
I just can't help but feel like it was raining money here yesterday, and I wasn't even in the same hemisphere. :/

Thanks for the info - I've read quite a bit about it already, and listened to a couple of the podcasts, so I understand how it works for the most part.
I'll probably get into a pool. Problem so far is Qt keeps crashing. It runs for a good while, but doesn't stay running. It's still doing the whole sync thing, though it has gone through that a fair bit faster than the docs implied.
