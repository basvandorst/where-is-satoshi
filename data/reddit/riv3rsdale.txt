If this happens - could this be the fuel needed to exceed the ATH this year?

If i did I would quit my job today.
Back in 2010 i was playing this game RFonline (private server) and I got bored with my account that one guy offered to buy it. I think it was around 45 bitcoin but said no as i dint trust it. (as far as i can remember I said no to the offer but part of me is telling me to check my old computer)
Anyways even if I did, I dont think I would be able to hodl at this point as I was in a really bad situation financially. Now I'm getting back on track and proud owner of 0.05 BTC.

Someone offered me $40 dollar worth of bitcoin back in late 2009-2010 for my character in RFonline which I just constantly rejected. He keeps insisting to buy it off me for weeks and funny thing is, it was a private server that only lasted for few months.
The fucker must be rich now and if you're reading this - Yes, I will sell you my account for only 1 bitcoin.

I agree with you.
Back in 2010 i was playing this game RFonline (private server) and I got bored with my account that one guy offered to buy it. I think it was around 45 bitcoin but said no as i dint trust it. (as far as i can remember I said no to the offer but part of me is telling me to check my old computer)

@_date: 2017-10-18 16:06:40
Can any human explain this to me?
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:07:42
This is very informative - Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:48:41
Im very new to bitcoin. Is it safe to just buy in lets say Kraken and store it there?
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:23:58
P.S I have .20 now
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:59:54
If it is id be happy with 0.9 bitcoin so i will have a full one. Congrats on your new life
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:02:57
What does this mean in an average joe term?
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:55:35
So your saying i should short bitcoin when the fork happens (to profit). Then sell my house to buy all bitcoins i can?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:39:38
Same. My thought that time was if mainstream doesnt think its gold it is not gold. Little did I know...
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:53:21
They are secretly pumping themselves
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:41:32
Thanks! I checked that Kraken has high fees for withdrawal? Is it still advisable to just wait until I bought enough to transfer them all together and save in fees and storing it at once?
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:12:15
Something i came across when researching Bitcoin back in 2014 (I didn't buy into it and now feeling absolutely shit bout it)
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:53:58
How confident are you?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:49:00
I use Kraken but im EU base - low fees and overall good.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:11:05
Bought my last dime yesterday - should've waited a day.
Part of me is saying this will be the lowest it can get.
