Part of the fun is to see people sink inside when you tell them what you gave them 3yrs ago astronomically increased in value.

Will Segwit-enabled wallets just gradually take over or will people be required to create new wallets?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:55:26
Would assume there may be initial teething issues, would make sense to hold back before full adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:40:44
Can anyone actually provide me with a ELI5 for Segwit and Lightning?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:15:13

Rehashing over and over to meet a specific preamble of 0's to the correct hash has always seemed like large wasting of resources. It's one of the few downsides of bitcoin if you ask me.

or one that is up and coming, or a coin they are personally interested in or have some sort of stake in.
Life is like a box of chocolates.

Let me just correct you buddy , I believe the term is "hodlers". You stay classy now buddy, have a great day now.

@_date: 2017-11-04 00:17:57

Bitcoin is basically ASIC ono.
However, other coins are tanking so it's going to cause an effect.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:17:36
folks don't hold bitcoins. they hodl them*
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:31:49
what site/system is this?
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:03:39
I never thought of it in relation to the value of bitcoin, surely that is countered by more people/bodies using Bitcoin in general.

When you say you stored your coins on mega. What information did you actually store? text file with your private/public key or?
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:27:01
so you stored the password, locked with a password next to your wallet? unless your password was brute forced with a dictionary attack, it could be someone who knew it was there.

Puppylinux is a tiny distro, literally minimal compared to your suggested distros whilst also maintaining a working gui.

in the end the node runners are mvp. no financial reward, just keeping the network alive.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:08:56
ironic to buy bitcoin related products with your fiat
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:19:32
i think the idea of mining is what is confusing you.
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:23:59
Pretty shit infographic made for numpties.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:06:48
you can't hold it, if you're already hodling it.

Transaction fees don't have to go up if adoption increases.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:12:34
id store it on mega /s
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:05:03
Apologies I think I ran across your comment a little too quick and assumed you meant transaction fees would increase.
It's very exciting to see what happens next regardless.

the similarities drawn by modern america and the founding fathers is uncanny, the future isn't in the past. everything is changing.
