I wasn't referring to Coinsetter as being shady. I was commenting on the general state of exchanges today. Most have either been hacked, have shady management, or have compromised privacy. It would be good for BTC if these exchanges could be weeded out by having to compete with larger Forex markets.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:19:14
My understanding is that smaller blocks mean less overhead for the miners because they don't have to upgrade their bandwidth over time etc... Also, a limited amount of space on the block will artificially create higher fees as people compete to get their transactions in a block. Then you have private companies like Blockstream working on off-chain payment channels and the more bandwidth they can keep off the main chain and controlled by them the better, I guess is their reasoning.

Just a quick writeup on bitFlyer vs other options in Japan. At the moment there seem to be only two viable exchanges, the other being BTCbox    
BTCbox is clearly superior at the moment (though things may evolve over time). I just made an account with bitFlyer to check it out and I logged in to find that the exchange was currently CLOSED! Their hours are from 9AM to 3PM apparently... BTCbox is of course 24/7 and their interface also seems better/ more intuitive. Finally I can't comment on withdrawal and deposit speeds from bitFlyer yet but I can say that BTCbox withdrawal speeds are blazing fast (sometimes just a few hours from putting in a request.)  
The only reason I would use bitFlyer at the moment is if there was an appreciable difference in exchange rate in their favor.  I do hope, however, that bitFlyer continues to improve, especially considering their recent influx of capital. Despite the Gox fiasco (which I personally got burned by) Japan is bound to be a big player in the BTC ecosystem again at some point given the laissez faire attitude of the government.

There are already a few exchanges operating in Japan. I use one of them frequently although there still is very little trading volume. The Japanese people are still very wary of the technology but once it seems stable/ safe enough I'm sure there will by many adopters. As for the government, they have taken a very hands-off position and I think they will be welcoming to new startups despite the Gox fiasco. So yeah, expect a price hike when the Japanese seriously enter the market but don't expect this to be for another 3-4 years.

btcbox.co.jp is the best option for those residing in Japan. As another commenter pointed out, there is a bit of a premium on the ask side meaning it is slightly more expensive to buy Bitcoin when compared to other international exchanges. I use it to bring money from abroad here so it works out well for me but when going the other way around expect to take a 1-5% hit.

Both are undergoing massive inflation at the moment. USD due to debt and BTC due to protocol. The difference being that BTC is designed to lower inflation to 0 at a relatively fixed point in the future while USD, on the other hand, just keeps getting xerox copied ad-infinitum. Apart from this, BTC has the advantages of low-friction transactions, the possibility of micro-payments, true ownership of the value token, pseudo-anonymity, and negligible transaction fees that remain low even with high-value transactions across borders.

Considering the timing of the huge dumps on Finex on the 4th that brought us down to $260... I think it's safe to speculate that someone knew of the Bitstamp hacking and acted on that information. However, now that we are sitting at $270, this has become the new reality, so the catalyst isn't really that important at this point.

BTC-E will just fade from relevancy, BitStamp too but it still has a few good years left in it. The biggest weak link now is Finex imho. Scandal last week with one of the owners trading on his own platform shows the immaturity of the management. They are great with innovation but offering leverage and swaps coupled with little oversight is going to lead to abuse or fractional reserves at some point.

btcbox.co.jp is definitely your best option for JPY to BTC. Kraken doesn't have any volume and Bitflyer is not a serious exchange in my opinion (for example, they are not 24/7 but operate on banking hours...)
On the Canada side I have no experience but from my understanding  is the top exchange.
Once you have your bank account linked in Japan the transfer time is very short, 6-12hrs in my experience. If you want to get the best price on the exchange set up your bid prices and within a few days you should be able to fill them without too much slippage (20K CAD ~ 58 BTC at current prices). The BTC can be transferred to Cavirtex instantly and will probably take an hour before they will credit you and let you trade with it. Then do the same thing again. Just set up you desired sell prices and wait for orders to be filled.

If they go all in then of course it will have a dramatic impact on the price of the currency as they currently clear roughly 53,000 contracts per second (blockchain has a real-world capacity of about 3.5 tx/s at the moment so there is a ways to go). There are 100,000,000 Satoshi in a BTC so you might imagine that they could move that number of contracts if they controlled just one BTC. But remember currently the minimum required fee to ensure your transaction is processed is .001 BTC. Therefore they could realistically clear fewer than 100,000 contracts per BTC or roughly 2 seconds worth of current transaction volume. But the introduction of the lightning network will up transaction capacity and the miner fee will be shifted a few decimal places when the market matures and BTC has a reasonable market cap. At least, this is my crude understanding of the situation.
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:15:46
What you are describing is called "arbitrage" and is a very common practice. Arbitrage generally keeps the prices of exchanges in line with each other. However, if one exchange gets far out of alignment with the others... that is often a sign that there is a problem at that exchange and that you need to proceed with caution. Gox coins, for example, were selling for a $100 + premium right before it made off with everyones BTC.

They will use Bitcoin inadvertently by utilizing the Open Assets Protocol (an evolution of colored coins that runs on the blockchain). So yes, they will be using BTC but only in the sense of utilizing the value tokens as markers. But the implication is that the more the value of BTC increases the more expensive it will be to run this asset tracking system. Still the cost compared to the current clearing house system will be negligible regardless of how much BTC appreciates.

True, but all previous auctions were announced months before the actual bidding took place. They need at least a 2 month lead time from announcement to sale to ensure that all participants have a chance to get in a bid. That would put this last auction way behind "schedule."

You do realize that at some point you will no longer be able to transact directly on the Bitcoin blockchain if we follow the Core roadmap. This is by design to force the plebs over to layer 2 (lighting) and means that we will then have to transact through gateways which are not trustless and which will (likely) be monitored and regulated by state actors somewhere down the road.

Core is trying to discourage the direct use of the blockchain as a digital P2P cash system. Instead they envision it as a settlement layer for large actors with the cash function exported to layer 2.

You will burn up about 1000x in electricity what you will ever earn mining with GPU. It will be loud, throw off heat, and just be really annoying in general. If you want to try out mining BTC just buy a cheap shitty USB miner... you will have much better luck

There was no clear information available and it caused a panic. People were faced with the awful choice of selling their coins for a fraction of what they were worth at the time or take the chance of losing everything. I was one of those people and only managed to save about 15% by getting them out through Bitcoin Builder. A very painful lesson.
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:20:48
The way coins were bought on BTCe today makes me think someone... somewhere... is running a fractional reserve and needed to acquire some BTC fast before being discovered.

I often use Private Internet Access (VPN) set to the US California, but not always. So far I have never had any problems, not sure why. I know I have logged into Coinbase on multiple occasions under my Japanese IP and have been able to buy BTC without being flagged. 
Also, yes, it seems BtcBox has changed their verification procedures, otherwise, possibly I was not required to go through this extra step because I have permanent resident status in Japan. Then again, it was quite some time ago, possibly I had to but just don't recall.
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:40:53
Not really because I don't currently live in the country where i need to buy BTC.

If the network can be made unusable by tossing a few coins on the ground then there is a problem that needs to be fixed. Attacks happen all the time in the wild, better get used to that fact. Groups with more resources and much more malicious intent ARE going to attack the network. To think differently is naive.
@_date: 2015-09-01 00:46:39
Thanks for the detailed description. I use Coinbase and BtcBox to move money between the US and Japan and I never ran into any problems. I just associated my US account with Coinbase and then went through their verification process (not too painful). And the BtcBox account was very easy to set up. At the beginning they just have you send ¥10,000 to their exchange to set up your Japanese bank account association. For BtcBox I never needed any other form of verification (to my memory).

As I explain below, most of my holdings are offline. However, I do need to use a centralized service if I want to use BTC for remittance between the US and the country I currently live in.

I think you should watch it again. He talks about the gold standard almost exclusively in a historical context. The narrative he constructs is the very wide view of the phenomenon and he is trying to merely explain what important characteristics BTC possesses that make it useful as, for example, a store of value or unit of account... He also says explicitly at the end that he doesn't believe it can (or should) replace any national currencies or historical units of account, rather it is a new 'native' digital asset that was designed with current technology in mind.

1BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi so for the price of a few BTC they could run their whole network for next to nothing (1 Satoshi used as a token for $1 ¥1,000 etc...)

Yes. He could have shut down deposits and saved a lot of people a lot of money. He lied about malleability. His actions directly led to a Lord of the Flies type scenario where people were forced to sell their coins for pennies on the dollar. Moreover, it's highly suspicious how he suddenly 'found' 200K coins only after people here on Reddit tracked them down. And to top things off... to this day he has not provided a plausible explanation for what happened... He's far from innocent IMHO
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:37:12
When you send large amounts of BTC out of Coinbase a little window pops up asking if you are sending the coins to an exchange (and if you ARE sending them to an exchange you are REQUIRED to state so, they tell you). They do this for tracking purposes I suppose. If the coins go to an exchange they go into a general pool and get shuffled around over time (ownership cannot be tracked). If the coins go to an address you control however, then they have a clear line of ownership. This means that Coinbase is likely creating a huge database to link ownership with personal identity and transactions in the blockchain. This could be a very valuable asset for them in the future.

We are still in a speculative phase so yes, an element of 'confidence' is essential to get us to a place where the true fundamentals--scarcity and utility--can work unimpeded. However, whether it be BTC or another iteration down the road, the genie is out of the bottle. People who recognise that blockchain technology is anti-fragile, non-proprietary and at least as innovative as say, transistors vs vacuum tubes, realise that there is no going back. What has been invented cannot be uninvented and will come to dominate given time.

@_date: 2015-03-30 14:16:33
The technology itself is anti-fragile so, for example, setting up a bunch of malicious nodes or mining equipment isn't really going to make a dent. You could use the 1 mil to margin short the hell out of it but you would likely get burned and the price would fall back in line quickly. The best way to attack BTC is social engineering and manufacturing a perceive threat. But at the end of the day, BTC is inevitable... or at least blockchain technology is, so there is that...
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:02:04
When BTC hits 1 trillion market cap, the above tip (250 Bits or 25000 Satoshi) will be worth ~ $12. The problem being that by that point USD will be hugely inflated and have lost much of it's relative purchasing power.
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:02:13
This is going to be an issue with the upcoming implementation of a larger block size and bloom filters. It's going to require a hard fork in the chain. Theoretically, if a certain percentage of the network decided that they didn't want to update to the new fork, they could just carry on with the old chain. This is unlikely to happen though as the value proposition for BTC lies in it's network effect and utility. Mining coins on the old chain would not be profitable for those who decided to stay.

Interesting, just found that they posted a notice in English too. A few discrepancies between the two. In the English version they say that they are bidding through Second Market (this information is omitted from the Japanese version). In the English version they stipulate a minimum possible bid of $100/BTC while in the Japanese version it seems that applicants aren't allowed to choose their own bid but instead throw money into a joint fund and that fund will likely bid at a rate of roughly 15% below market value as of March 5th. In both cases a 2% fee is collected by Bitflyer.

In linked PDF they say they are looking for participants to enter a joint bid for a portion of the 50,000 BTC. Must put up at least one million yen (~$8,500) and can pledge more in increments of one million yen up to a maximum of 100 million yen (~$850,000).

1BTC = 100,000,000 satoshi.
Which means, currently 25,000 cents gets you one-hundred-million staoshi
In other words... you get 4,000 satoshi/ 1 cent
I'd say that is quite cheap

Again, the purpose of the video is NOT to suggest that BTC will become the new reserve currency or that it will outcompete gold or fiat currencies. He says this EXPLICITLY in the video. He only mentions them in fact as a backdrop for the meta-narrative that he presents which is to say that BTC has important characteristics that make it innovative when compared with past value-exchange assets. Most importantly, he suggests that BTC is not tied to dept (money as debt) in the same way that fiat has historically been. In the short-term there is no chance of BTC becoming a world reserve currency. To achieve even 1/7th of the market cap of gold each BTC would have to be valued at ~$50,000 assuming all 21 million bitcoin were in circulation. He does suggest however, I feel, that through BTC a new innovation has been made and that it is inevitable that this will impact our financial system in the long-term. How, is still unclear. It is very possible that BTC itself will fail or that the technology will continue to evolve and adapted in new ways.

Having a big problem with Coinbase. For some reason my credit card address won't verify. I want to do arbitrage with MtGox (have a bank account in Japan) but I've been on hold for the past two weeks because of this issue. I've tried everything: called credit card company, sent support requests to Coinbase, copy and pasted exact address from my credit card online page... nothing working and it's costing me a lot of money. Very frustrating.
