I guess I'm just making this whole thing up then

Yeah, and coupled with a text message verification it would be a two factor authentication. 2fa. But whatever, I'm not concerned with the semantics, half of these comments are really missing the point here.

All I'm reading is "they're scumbags but they've cornered the market in BTC sales." Which seems right by my experience.

Wow, tone down the shill thesis. I'm not seeing a lot of complaints about coinbase  freezing accounts of cocaine dealers. 
They froze my account because the 2fa email confirmation they sent me DIDNT REGOCNIZE ITSELF. And this has happened to me no joke, 50+ times in the last year and a half. I'm so sick of it. 
If you have a company making what I would imagine is tens or hundreds of millions off it's constituents, they should have the goddamn decency to upgrade their software, and hire some more goddamn tech support. This shit is beyond unacceptable. It's atrocious.

GDAX is amazing. Coinbase is the Comcast of BTC markets.

Thanks, I'll make my complaint. Appreciate it.

This is the route of my issue. I've been using GDAX and simply love it. Coinbase froze for 24 hours when their 2fa didn't recognize it's own validation. And I've had this problem COUNTLESS times before. It's fine if they're swamped, even if they want to cover their ass with fees. But the software has fucked me so many times, it's unbelievable. 
And getting locked out of your account is annoying when it's a leisure account like Facebook. But this is my goddamn bread and butter they're fucking with. It's unbelievable.

I understand how money has value. I'm curious as to why bitcoin gains or loses dollar value. It's not stock in a company, why does it gain more value over time? What even is a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:07:55
Basically. I mean, it's not a company with tangible value, and it's not backed by any nation or bank. So why does it just go up and up? Is there a ceiling? Or is it solely based on how many people own it?

I understand. I just don't get what makes it grow over time. Will there be a ceiling?
