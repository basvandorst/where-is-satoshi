You didn't LOSE anything. You bought some bitcoins.

Good enough analogy. Sometimes it helps to spin it a little different so people get it. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:06:03
Why be a currency at all? It's goal could just be a quick and efficient way to move value. It's good at that today.

Google could easily be the Google of Bitcoin.

Doesn't matter if it's MySpace or a fad or whatever. It's introduced a new technology/idea/concept. That's progress. If there's something better to come of it - much as Facebook was to MySpace - let's do it! 
Credit cards, PayPal  are old news.

It's not entirely obvious to me how this is a good idea; but I'm very excited to see how this will be used in practice. It's a very innovative application/integration of the two. It definitely makes the in-game economy more real.

Wow - I'm all ready to drop Bitcoin and switch to PayPal -er- I mean Dwolla now.... that looks great!
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:42:01
Yes. This. Good News.
Until Bitcoin finds some utility in the real world, none of the rest of this will really matter. It's not really worth anything (beyond speculation) if you can't use it.

It's down 50%?? All this time I thought it was up for the year... I'm so confused ~~~
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:02:21
Don't give advice.
Talk about what Bitcoin is, how it works, all of the great benefits, etc. Let them decide on their own to "get into it."

Not sure there's any guarantee alts will be profitable for any time. I've switched GPUs over to alts to sell for BTC. Can't really imagine that being sustainable if we're all doing it. Not even sure who's trading alt for BTC. Long term speculators?
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:48:57
Absolutely! I'm not saying it's worthless (because it's far from worthless). I'm definitely not saying it doesn't have uses today and now; but it's still not my everyday payment method.  I am saying that it's encouraging to see adoption in more places. The more places we can use it, the more it's worth. It's not really incorrect - I'm just glad it's not the current reality. We're not done yet.

This may be FUD; but don't think there aren't some lessons in here. It's an interesting perspective at minimum. 
"Those who cannot remember the past, are condemned to repeat it"
If you can see that Bitcoin is not (only) a currency, you'll see his whole argument is irrelevant. Bitcoin doesn't need to replace our fiat government controlled money. We just need a way to take it on the Internet and out of the banks.

I'll second Coinbase. They've had a few bumps; but they've become pretty reliable.
Bitinstant was starting to look good....

I'd like to believe it's just a sign Mt. Gox users are (finally) getting the hint and moving to a better platform. 
Left Gox for Bitstamp many months ago. Haven't looked back.
I'd like to see it hover around $110 for a while. Seems reasonable and sustainable there. 
Also, consider the mining difficulty jump. We've needed a correction.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:23:49
It's working over here too!
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:12:02
And a time ago BitInstant.
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:36:55
Yes. That. 
Debit card would be a very handy transitional move.

Fixed title --
Please Sticky: Can we stop with the Coinbase posts?
@_date: 2013-08-21 23:06:57
Yeah. Very possible. I wouldn't recommend keeping your entire stash on your phone anyhow. At least not more than some spending money.
I think paper wallets might be the most secure storage method. At least for a computer software security POV.
