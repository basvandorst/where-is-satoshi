Its not removing anything as far as I know, and not undoing any transactions in any blocks?
All I really know is that 1st Feb is when they'll do a merge of Hush/Unity/Dex/Bitcoin UTXO Sets missed into a 'Hodler tossed salad' into a KMD Asset chain. 
Not too sure why fraud would be implied here, it's essentially just another airdrop as per the other Bitcoin forks, except this is a merger not a split.

Yeah even though SegWit was marked as opt-in, it really should be in wallets as default both P2WPKH and Bech32 addresses.
LN really shouldn't even being used on Mainnet, LN devs themselves have said you shouldn't, but that aside - again this would be entirely up to the wallet developers to ensure that mainstream users are not exposed to the behind the scenes mind boggling cryptography and are just prompted for an address to send to and the wallet would take care of the rest such as opening/closing, adding funds etc..

Man I don't know what to tell you? I don't know what implicit threats you're insinuating here?
As for blindly trusting people? Well obviously that should the last thing people should be doing. But in Lightenings' case they seem open enough to show us the whitepaper, the code, the results of their tests, the first atomic chain swap and the demos of lightening working - all that combined doesn't need blind trust - its all there for inspection, I don't even think people are forcing you to even use Lightening, I guess it'll be opt-in just like SegWit. If you don't want to use it, then don't? Bitcoin itself doesn't care and will carry on regardless.
But I agree that there is little discussion, I know there are some gem threads in here, but it's just been absolutely dominated by price and newcomers withdrawing from Coinbase threads.
If you want discussion and want to find out their position on these threats etc, jump into their [Slack Channel]( and ask, that room is full of more people that understand lightnening better.
But as for the title regarding Fractional Reserve, that's just FUD due the simply fact that neither the thread you linked nor yourself have provided any evidence of it.

Considering the fucking monumental growth of each exchanges userbase had has the past month or two, they are probably all doing their best. 
They are all probably dealing with a lot of requests from either ill informed, or not informed at all as to what Bitcoin even is - they just see Bitcoin in the news and throw money at any exchange that will take it. People honestly need to give them a break.

SegWit is a new format for Transactions.
Its a clever piece of technology that allows far more transactions per block, the down side is it requires far and wide spread adoption. I seen some esitmate floating around that there could be up to 8000 SegWit TX in a Block, providing all TX in that block were SegWit based.
The more people/wallets/exchanges use SegWit, the better for Bitcoin it will be, more TXs in a block, less fees per TX.

Correct, the only way Bitcoin are made, is via mining, there is no quantitative easing in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't use encryption.
Secondly, if any of the three letter agencies had quantum computing at the ready, Bitcoin would be the last thing on the list to attack. 
My guess is they would take out SSL, TLS and any and all VPN encryption technologies, providing far more value to them than Bitcoin would. 
I guess Bitcoin would softfork to a quantum resistant pub-key algo.

Bitcoin isn't encrypted and doesn't use encryption.
It uses SHA256 a one way hash function. 
Encryption is a two way function.
A node has generally already validated the entire blockchain, it just validates the new one as it comes in. The miners receive a new block and then immediately starts mining on the new block.

Ok. That sounds like you have the address and the corresponding private key. 
So what I would do is something like this:
* 1. Go to [ and download the website to your desktop, then turn off your internet.
* 2. Click into Wallet Details tab and paste that longer code, the private key into the field, this should give you the Private Key in a QR code down the bottom.
* 3. Use a wallet like [Coinomi]( and sweep the Bitcoin into Coinomi.
* 4. Use Coinomi to send the Bitcoin to an exchange of your choice to sell.
Just be sure to be careful, and certainly do not rush anything here. Be absolutely sure of each step that you are doing - always double check everything - then check it again.

The majority of these forks are going to be just straight pump and dump coins as they provide no actual benefit at all. 
If there were any benefit and their 'innovation' had merit, I'd see no reason they couldn't just write a BIP and see if there is consensus to get it merged into Core. 
Then there's the privacy issue, along with the potential for loss of coins entirely whether it be something you accidentally did, like sent BCH to BTC address or malicious action taken by the dev or others that causes loss.
Finally, for god sake... Take your coins of the exchange.

I suppose so, But every contract would have its own wheel if we're going with that. Contract A starts spinning that wheel on Date X, and finishes spinning on Date Y.
If you guessed right, then you'd earn the difference in Fiat, if you guess wrong, then you lose the difference.
IQOption is a site that you can do this now, but it requires that you have actual Bitcoin to bet with, unlike these Futures which require Fiat only, and I'm sure I read somewhere that the minimum contract is 5 Bitcoin.

Don't see any measurement? Its the legend on the top left hand side of the first graph on the page.
Did you find your sat/b fee? If so, then mouse over the graph and you'll see the table that shows all the fee in their colour. Lets say your sat/b was 70+. You'd be in the thick light blue band under the thick Gray band at the top - wait time would be a long ass time. Paid 140 sat/b, you'd be in the top darker blue band - wait time a hell of a lot less than the 70+ band.
I also said gauge roughly how long, not provided you with exact timing. Every 10 or so minutes, you'll see that it dips. That's how you extrapolate out to estimate the time you particular TX could take.

1. Once the last Bitcoin is mined, fees will be the sole reward for miners.
2. 2014 is an ancient time in cryptospace. There's been pressure of blockspace which is why the fee's are increasing. We need more adoption of Segwit, and Lightening Network has been making some serious progress. I'd be OK with a 2MB blocksize just to temporarily release fee pressure until Segwit and Lightening adoption is widespread.

Bruh.. That TX will definitely be propagated across the network.. If this TX isn't being propagated, then holy fuck - no one elses would either. That's probably the biggest fee I've ever seen and if I was a miner that would be the first TX I'd use.
But I completely with you about the fees being ridiculous, and there seems to be a slight growing support for a blocksize increase.
Would it even actually happen, no idea. But I'm for an increase to assist us whilst SegWit adoption increases.

No - personally I don't want massive blocks for Bitcoin, but I am one of the few that would like to see an increase in Blocksize - just enough to relieve some of the fee pressure whilst SegWit is still being integrated and deployed to wallets and exchanges, or even BitcoinCore GUI for that matter. 
SegWit and LN will definitely help here, we just need more time for exchanges and wallets to implement, although LN may still be a while off - but the devs are making some great progress.

If everyone tried to cash out of Bitcoin **they could**. The price would drop and those that know better would buy up them cheap coins.
Compare that with everyone trying to withdraw their Fiat from the bank, **they can't**. There would be a run on the bank and the bank doesn't have the money in reserve for all of these withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:54
Nope, no affect here. BTC/NZD is relatively stable compared to USD/BTC.
Even during the dips in BTC/USD that cause the newbies to fold, we still stable, if anything it increases here. 
In any case, I hope it comes crashing down further, I'm ready to start to panic buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:07:44
The sender *does* pay the fee. OP Paid the fee to load the wallets, then the owner of that wallet became the sender and paid a fee to send the BTC to their own wallet.

You are describing exactly what RBF ([Replace By Fee]( is.
This, in my opinion, is what broke 0-conf TX reliability. Because as you noted, you can send a TX to a merchant, mark it to enable RBF. They'll see the TX, you receive the item. Then you go outside the store and you send the new TX with a higher fee back to yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:25:33
Well it would be a race to the bottom in terms of Fiat value for each person cashing out, but there are people like me that are waiting a mass sell off, as I'll be at the bottom catching undervalued coins.

[Segregated Witness]( is a new transaction format, that allows a lot more transactions to fit inside the block. The more SegWit TXs in a block, the more TX in total there could be. 
[Lightening Network]( would allow two or more parties to commit Bitcoin to opening channel and TX between each other and other near instant and at very very low cost. This is of course not great for the miners (they could collect fees on commitment TX only), but the Hubs would collect the minimal fees.

I think ArcBit allows importing xPub, so you can export xPub from Samourai and import to ArcBit to see if it finds the address with the funds. Sentinel also does this as well  but you may not trust Samourai at this point.
You could also try restoring the wallet using the mnemonic.

Very difficult if you have Bitcoin in a highly monitored Address such as the NiceHash address.
I doubt any legit exchange will accept TX from this address, I would be hesitant to say that any of the darknet mixers would either, would it not taint their wallets?
I would say that if you managed to obtain a large stack of Bitcoin, you'd need to exchange that to some other untraceable Altcoin before word spreads too far about the addresses used.

Personally, I think Lightning is great, and is definitely on its way.
However, I don't really see it as *the* solution to the scaling problem. Its fantastic for what it does do however, as many near instant transactions as you can, as long as you have committed your Bitcoin to the channel. I just don't see everyone rushing to commit all their Bitcoin to opening a channel. There would be very good use cases for lightning though.
But, It's almost like the Lightning Network has become a middleman Bitcoin didn't need. 
I see it like this for the average person. In order to reduce fees, we have to pay the **high fee** to get onto the Lightning Network. Send the actual BTC for almost no cost, but then also pay the high fee **again** to close the channel.
Still, technically, amazing how it works though.

What I'm really not sure about is the mining algo change? 
Would this not make miners less likely to return after the change and even more likely the changer after that? When they know they could be forked off the network at any time because the Algo has been change again and their investment has been voided and would mine something else?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:45:15
Yeah my point exactly, I'm just not convinced miners would agree to throw their million dollar investment in hardware out the window. Even with an excellent BIP, would such a change ever reach consensus? Seems in order of magnitude higher in contention than increasing the blocksize in some well thought out and pragmatic way.
If it did reach consensus it's unlikely they'd return, they'd go mine another SHA256 coin instead. I'm not a miner, but if I was I would not return.

How can I use SegWit on Bitcoin Core gui?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:49:54
Bollocks. Bitcoin is a **peer to peer** currency.
Where in the Whitepaper does it ever state the only place you can obtain Bitcoin is by showing all your identification to some middleman exchange....
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:47:19
That's one of the downsides to a deflationary currency, it favors hodlers.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:14:45
I've honestly watched just about every single Bitcoin conference talk, speech, presentation and interview that is available on Youtube. 
And I'm still convinced that it will allow for an actual and immediate, albeit temporary, fee pressure release. Because honestly the fees are absolutely fucked right now. 
Then hopefully SegWit usage is a lot higher now, exchanges for example should all be running SegWit by default. Along with Lightning Network up and running all working together to make Bitcoin a workable currency again. 
Then there's the next innovation for Bitcoin that hasn't even been thought of yet that's going to come out and increase usage, then adoption of Bitcoin even further.

Ah, that's interesting. Economic policy isn't my greatest strength in Bitcoin in terms of tinkering with Bitcoin generation and it's effects on price, inflation rate and so on.
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable could edit the original [plot.ly]( chart form BashCo to reflect the changes that a increased block generation and halved block reward would do - unless it really is exactly the same, but that's my limited knowledge coming into play lol.
Thinking about this, I have some more reading to do.

If that's the case, I'd suggest use a paper wallet until such time you have enough Bitcoin that you deem worth enough to store in a hardware wallet. Then sweep the funds then.

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:30
People essentially betting on the price of Bitcoin, without needing to have any Bitcoin, and any losses/gains are settled in Fiat, so there's no actual Bitcoin Transaction that takes place with these futures contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:28
Possibly, which means neither you or I could trade on that exchange so what's the point?
What you're proposing is pretty scammy, intended or not. Bitcoin functions without middlemen such as yourself trying to skim the cream off the top.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:45:55
1. They are all stored in each nodes individual mempool, once a TX is received, the node checks inputs have not been consumed, then passes it on to its connections. All the way till it lands in a miners mempool. The miner then uses his own mempool as a the pool of transactions to include in their block. [Watch mempool in real time]( or [broken down by fees](
2. It starts asking its newly found connections for the first block, validates it, asks the network for the next block, and so on, until until its synced.
3. The majority of wallets should be using [BIP0032]( &amp; [BIP044]( in order to generate your pub/priv keypairs, then checks the Blockchain for TXs using their nodes. Some wallets such as Samourai allow you to connect to your own node instead of theirs.
4. The miner can set their own rules for which TXs they want to use in their blocks. There are also services that you can use to accelerate your transactions for a fee they will add your TX to their mining pool's mempool and they will try mine it that way. Every block needs at least 1 transaction to be valid, and this is the Coinbase transaction that gives the miner the block reward. [Here's]( a recent one by AntPool.
5. It constructs the TX signs it and send it out to either the wallet providers or your own node which then broadcasts the TX. Then follows 1 above. If I send you 1 BTC from my Code node, and your using Copay wallet, your copay wallet would periodically check the next handful of your addresses against the Blockchain. Once it detects a TX, its yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:04:27
It is...? I defo have an anon account there. Maybe its changed since?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:43:42
1. No.
2. I'm in NZD and just use MBS or LocalBitcoins. Not sure if Aussie has their own exchanges, but try there first. 
3. Nobody should be confident, this is an experiment still in its infancy.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:33:56
No, wouldn't think so. Lightning Network is going to solve a transaction throughput problem.

As long as you withdraw it using GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:26:36
Of course it follows? You said boycott SegWit laggards, Bitcoin Core hasn't fully implemented SegWit in their GUI, so should we boycott them?
Who knows what exchanges are doing, but I agree they can all just get a move on and start using SegWit addresses by default. I'm looking forward to the day we have 100% SegWit transaction blocks.

This is why I always think you should give blank paper wallets to people. When they come back to you saying its empty - **then** send them BTC.
This way you know they have at least done the bare minimum looking into Bitcoin and how it works.

That's fair. All the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:40
5 days and counting.
I'm not worried though, one of these days the miner will take pity on my TX and confirm it for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:26:56
Cool idea, but how about giving them an empty Bitcoin paper wallet first, then only send them Bitcoin if they come back to you stating that its empty.
This way that have at least done the very bare minimum in looking into Bitcoin and more importantly how it actually works. Then be as generous as needed to those ones.

@_date: 2017-12-09 08:58:28
Well sure it will reduce the TX that miners are validating. But they still need to validate everyone elses Transactions that are not on Lightning. Miners also still need to mine both the opening and closing Transactions of the Lightning Channel.
Blocks being mined will still be generated, on average, every 10 minutes, regardless of how many on/off chain Transactions there are.

Well yes. Hence it was a complete guess lol, most plausible in any case. But you're right - I don't see this going on forever. 
If you want an actual answer, you'll have to ask the exchanges on what their outgoing fee policy would be going forward.

Who the LBC Bitcoin Sellers?
All online trades are protected by escrow. When a trade is started the amount of Bitcoins for the trade is automatically reserved from the seller's LocalBitcoins Wallet. This means that if the seller runs away with your money and does not release your Bitcoins LocalBitcoins.com support can release the Bitcoins to you from escrow. 
Of the 100's of trades I've done on there, I haven't encountered any scam sellers.

The main issue I believe that r/Bitcoin has with Bitcoin Cash is the fact they are shilling so hard that they are *the REAL Bitcoin*...
When in fact they are not, they are just another Altcoin that **forked from** Bitcoin and kept Bitcoin in its name, just like BitcoinGold, BitcoinPrivate, Bitcoin[InsertNameHere] and the other 100's of them.
The main distinction between BitcoinCash and the others, is that all the other Forks know they are just an Altcoin, and not one of them pertain to be the real Bitcoin - Except BitcoinCash. 
Secondly, BitcoinCash's solution to increase transaction capacity, is just to increase the block size. That is not a solution, that's called kicking the can down the road.

I've never tried any mixer service, I've always thought that you'd be exchanging your (potentially tainted) BTC for actually tainted BTC.
Secondly, you're trusting a third party in a trustless network to send you back Bitcoin. 
If you want to cover your tracks, Shapeshift/Changelly into Dash/Monero/Hush/Sumo or any of the 100's of privacy coins. Send a few Private TX to yourself, then slowly convert back to Bitcoin.
But let us all know how this went..

@_date: 2017-06-11 23:09:51
There are no from Addresses as these are instead Unspent Outputs. An unspent output is simply an output of a transaction which isn't yet an input of another transaction.
With Bitcoin, every output in a transaction is like a separate balance which you can later spend. So receive Bitcoin three times, and if you want to spend it all, you need to use all three outputs as input.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:57:18
Hardware: KeepKey or Trezor
Software: Breadwallet or Jaxx
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:55:27
ok, so what denotes that unspent output is legit?
The Blockchain. 
All full nodes that hold a local copy of the blockchain have verified all blocks, transactions and holds a UTXO set up till now. The transactions that have been broadcast, but not confirmed are in the all the Nodes mempool. Its these mempool transactions are then validated by Nodes to check that it is a valid transaction and the outputs being spent in this transaction have not been already used. 
For me, Dust refers to any UTXO that costs more to move it than the total Bitcoin amount in the UTXO itself, so things like small mining/faucet payouts would be considered dust as the cost of the transaction of combining all of these very small UTXO into a new transaction would be very high. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:11:25
