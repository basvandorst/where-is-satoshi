I don't understand what you mean. How would you invest with bitcoin and control you own keys?

Bitbank is not a webwallet, it is a investment fund for bitcoin mining.

Yes this was my problem, I'm on ubuntu and wanted to go segwit. Updated my electrum as it seem to be the only option out there. Was very disappointed that I got a bech address that was not recognized by my exchange as a valid address. Anyway, I have ledger wallet on it's way so I can start using segwit soon! Moving to segwit is not straightforward. Someone should make a website where people can filter current solutions depending on their OS.

Any other country with similar strategy, I know both Ukraine and Malta are thinking in similar lines but nothing set in stone yet.
To be honest I would not like living in Belarus...

Can only share my thoughts. I stopped accumulating bitcoins in late 2015 because of the scaling issue. There are many other great coins out there and there is no reason why I should put all eggs in one basket with such debacle on the horizon. But now over a year later with still no progress I'm also starting to sell off some of mine bitcoins. There reason is that the price of bitcoin will have to fall painfully before the different sides will be motivated enough to even talk about the problems in a free and open manner and for the miners to actually make a choice. If things starts to clear up I can buy my coins back at a lower price, or if not then I can be glad I sold.

Checkout the bitcoinmarkets sub. You can even post there without the uncomfortable feeling of wondering if your post will be hidden or removed.

The Blocksize remains the same, 1MB, but since they put the signatures on the outside they can fit more transactions inside the blocks. Great,  but to claim that the Blocksize had increased is just wrong. Yes I have done the research and I'm a developer thank you. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 06:20:39
Except that the Blocksize remain the same, 1Mb.

This is so spot on that my first thought was: what the hell did I invest in!? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:03:08
I used to use bitcoin.de but I care a lot about my data being safe so not any more!
what is the better option for people with german bank accounts?

I went to Azores, subtropical islands in the Atlantic, it is a paradise here. Portugal is pretty dry and very hot in the summers, here it is crazy green and perfect weather all year around ( 16 - 24 degrees ) . If you love nature, hiking, diving, cheap great food, whales and dolphin's you will be very happy here. There are plenty of houses to rent and a great place for a homebase. The crime rate is close to zero. Wonderful nice people, I really can not think of a bad thing,, maybe the high humidity some days.

That would be more like white blood cells...

In the end I just left them, there is a user here called bitbankroller, try sending him a message. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:40:42
I hope so too. When I was looking around I didn't find anyone claiming that bitbank stole their coins so don't stress too much. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:19:08
It took a month for me to get my coins out, used to take 24 hours last year. How long have you been waiting? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:01:55
True words! There are tons of good things happening around here but everyone is just crying about the price.

It is pretty clear why bitcoin is spiking in China everywhere on the web, except this subreddit since the rules here doesn't allow us to discuss such things. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 22:34:08
Haha, priceless, this is getting really funny :-D

He recently held a presentation against segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:59:32
Yes, you can never argue in a court that the bank stole your money. It is not your money, that's why they can lend it out and speculate with it as they please. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:08:15
I rather not, this subreddit is sensitive about controlling information. But a YouTube search should find it.
