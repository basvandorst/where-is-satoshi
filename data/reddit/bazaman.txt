thats the magic of only putting in what you can lose. Everything could drop to 0 tomorrow and i'd be fine. I'd be pissed about the missed opportunity but not the loss of initial investment. I think some people get caught up in checking blockfolio every 10 mins and they really aren't doing themselves any favors.

Aha, looks like you are indeed one of them. I'm not going to waste my time explaining this in detail but a tl:dr would go like this:
You THINK you are the good guys and they are the bad guys, but the rest of the civilized world sees you as the villains. 
Keep beating up innocent people whom you believe are deserving of it. In fact, why don't you round them all up and kill them, then you'll really be showing them who the fascists are.

Do I still get the free BCC if I store my BTC in a private wallet? or does it have to be on an exchange?

He was making a joke about how they think they are fighting for freedom while doing the exact opposite.

[1]( , [2]( , [3]( , [4]( , and many more...
They have websites, fb groups, patreon pages. They organize violence, doxxing, harassment. They have been involved in countless violent riots such as Berkley (twice), Sacramento, Toronto, G20, +++.
These people aren't made up, they are real and they are a radicalized threat that could get out of control soon. You thinking they are made up at least puts my mind at ease in knowing you aren't one of them. 
Also please let me know what T_D is.

Yes. And just to clarify, they call themselves "anti-fascist" but everyone else sees them as the fascists.

I'm referring more to the political group that call themselves anti-fascist (antifa for short), no so much to a general dictionary definition. And if after understanding that distinction you still believe antifa to be the ones fighting fascism.... I really can't justify continuing this conversation.

I don't think you can use cards but there are plenty of Paypal accepters. An order could get filled within an hour I suppose, mostly depends on the method of payment they take and how fast you make payment. To be safe, make sure to always make the purchase through the website and not peer-to-peer since the website holds coins in escrow once you put in the purchase demand. The exception to this would be to buy in-person with cash, in which case you save yourself the site's fees at the cost of having to be a bit more cautious.

I just used localbitcoin for cash. Yeah it was 6% above market but I have already made that money back (in 3 days) plus an additional 150$.

I feel so blessed. I made my first large purchase today (1500$) through localbitcoin. I was originally gonna buy yesterday, but the guy I was buying from wanted to do it today. I bought right as it hit its lowest point, and it started coming back up right after the confirmations came in :D
