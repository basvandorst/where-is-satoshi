A product can fail for any combination of technical or marketing/advertising reasons. In fact, viewing technical benefits in isolation is not quite right. Bitcoin has unique and positive features over Apple Pay (decentralization, lower cost, etc.), but if Apple Pay is good enough and it is advertised effectively, it will be used widely quickly and build network benefits (the more places that accept it, the greater the benefit to the next retailer considering it) that give it additional value. The future of payments will unfold as a complex, dynamic process where advertising plays a role. Bitcoin should be advertised.

But there is gain through the transaction fees. It is small, but I assert it is worth more than the propagation-time cost we have been discussing. I base this on 1) the propagation time hit being quite small in seconds ( compared to the many minutes spent hashing, and 2) the alternative giving Bitcoin a critical flaw that it does not appear to have.

In a way, though, that goes to the point it is making. The risk is that some digital money comes along (one not existing now, arguably) with enough new features to make it transcend Bitcoin in the way Bitcoin transcends fiat. To counter, Bitcoin needs to assimilate new features, just as you say.
@_date: 2015-05-18 12:28:29
This particular idea is not to address the problem of illegal copies, but rather that of unpaid royalty payments for software (or hardware) that is sold legally. Illegal copies hurt both the licensor and licensee of IP.

That makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:24:07
I think so. All the real-time aspects are handled on the blockchain, rather than or licensor-managed software and hardware. There is no burden of connectivity, computer up time, or reliable storage on the licensor. It seems there is real benefit to be found.
Just think, a licensor could put a clause in a contract tomorrow, and it would work. Tallying up for verification, even, could be postponed. The licensee, if not already Bitcoin savvy, would need to set up a wallet and make transactions, but that's not too hard (and allocating a week to do it could be built into tomorrow's contract).

Just an idea. I think looking deeply into potential applications of embedding information in private keys would be interesting. There is ample discussion of embedding in public keys and addresses, which presents the information for all to see. But if the info were embedded in private keys, it would be hidden, yet could be used for things like proving existence. Embedding info, even completely, in the private key would still let you transfer funds out, so doing the embedding would only cost the transaction fees.

Very good points. I would even add that a new ETF will facilitate shorting and add supply, which could drive down price.
However, your prediction lets me counter with a prediction in which I am confident: more than $50. The reasons are (in an order guided more or less by your points)
The stakeholders are incentivized to address problems that would cause price to fall below $50.
The always-existing market to use them to get around just and unjust laws.
The potential to use them legally in ingenious ways.
A strong community.
Software improvements that make them easier to use an manage.
The ability to store them at no cost in fees or taxes.
Growing awareness.
No single country (or handful of countries likely to do so) can pass adverse laws to drive it down that low, and favorable laws are also likely.

A layer could be added between donors and the trust. Legal entities (of any number) in this layer could take general donations on a theme and support the developers aligned with that theme.

Great question. For a product to own itself, it would need the means by which to pay for its own upkeep. This ability is not theoretically limited by the number of existing satoshis, though. You could have a device that earned one satoshi at a time and then used it as a payment before earning more. If it held one satoshi only a fraction of the time, it would be consuming less than a satoshi on average.

The critical need for the impossible-to-predict applications building on Bitcoin is a keen insight. The case for a 5-10 year time frame, though, is less clear. It could be slower than the Internet history due to regulatory factors or faster because it directly relates to money and there is more investment.

It's great you are working on a market for this. It creates value. But selling a put on 4K BTC at the current price will take a rare someone with the following three traits:
1) has $1M USD sitting around (as I'm sure you will want it in escrow).
2) holds belief that BTC is not overvalued (hence selling a put).
3) holds belief that BTC will not go up by much (because the large upside potential lies with your client).
Each of these three requirements independently has members on these boards, but the intersection of the three sets is small and may even be zero.

A bitcoin address is normally derived from the private key. If you don't mind losing the bitcoins, you can directly create an address (with no known private key) holding the data you would like to store on the blockchain. Here is an example:  (The last six characters are a checksum and cannot hold part of the message.) This has the downside of requiring you to burn bitcoins and requiring bitcoin nodes to manage the address as if it could be spent from at any time. Because of this, the Bitcoin developers enabled OP_RETURN. It allows more data without burning bitcoins (other than a miner fee), and is more efficient. I cannot personally vouch for it, but here is an example service that lets you use OP_RETURN:

Many investments due to long history, underlying returns, and correlation with other investments can be assigned statistics. In the long run stocks return 7% after inflation, a PE of 16 is average, stocks drop by 50% three times per century, and all that. The dice still have to be rolled, but against governing statistics. Bitcoin on the other hand has no or few dependable statistics. Not only do the dice need to be rolled, we don't even know what we are rolling against.

Some couples opt for a traditional wedding, while others go for the Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas. But David Mondrus and Joyce Bayo may be the first to have incorporated Bitcoin.
Before about 50 guests at a Walt Disney World hotel in Florida recently, the couple used a Bitcoin automated teller machine to record their written vows on the currency’s so-called block chain — an open ledger that permanently stores information.
“A diamond is forever, a marriage is forever, but when was the last time anyone looked at their wedding vows?” Mr. Mondrus said. “This technology allows us to get that data and store it in a way that is retrievable and noncorruptible.”
As Bitcoin’s price has declined over the last year, critics have been quick to declare the virtual currency dead. Bitcoin’s true value, though, might be not in the currency itself but in the engine that makes it possible.
Underlying Bitcoin — created as a way to make payments directly, anonymously and outside government control — is the block chain, a decentralized database that is driven by cryptography.
Explaining how the block chain works can tangle the tongues of even those who are most enthusiastic about Bitcoin. Most resort to metaphors or diagrams. At a basic level, the block chain is a searchable ledger where all transactions are confirmed, in a matter of minutes, by a network of computers working to perform complex algorithms. Each part of the network maintains a copy of the ledger. About six times an hour, a new group of accepted transactions — a block — is created, added to the chain and broadcast to the other parts of the network. In this manner, all transactions are recorded and linked and thus can be traced. It is nearly impossible to modify past blocks in the chain.
By simply downloading the Bitcoin software, anyone can gain access to the block chain, search it and submit transactions to the network.
Entrepreneurs worldwide are now working to harness that technology for use beyond Bitcoin transactions. The block chain, they say, could ultimately upend not only the traditional financial system but also the way people transfer and record financial assets like stocks, contracts, property titles, patents and marriage licenses — essentially anything that requires a trusted middleman for verification.
“There’s a race going on to extend the block chain’s capabilities,” said Adam Ludwin, a co-founder of Chain.com, a start-up that seeks to help developers build Bitcoin applications.
On web forums and at Bitcoin conferences, talk is shifting to the next generation of applications built on block-chain technology. So-called Bitcoin 2.0 projects dominated the conversation at the Satoshi Roundtable, a retreat for Bitcoin enthusiasts at a resort in the Dominican Republic in February, according to accounts from some participants. About 20 percent of Chain’s roughly 5,000 users are developing nonfinancial block-chain applications, compared with less than 10 percent a year ago, Mr. Ludwin said. Banks and multinational telecommunications companies are quietly expressing interest in ways to take advantage of the block chain.
Investors are also starting to bet on the technology. Through the end of February, Bitcoin companies had raised $550 million in venture capital, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. And although much of that financing has been directed to trading platforms, exchanges and digital-wallet start-ups — $106 million alone has gone to Coinbase, a popular provider of Bitcoin wallets — companies working on block-chain applications are beginning to secure chunks of financing. For instance, Blockstream — which is looking to extend the block chain’s capabilities — announced it had raised $21 million in November. Ripple Labs, which oversees an online payment system called Ripple, has raised $9 million from investors and is finalizing another round of financing.
Among the venture capital firms that have backed Bitcoin-related companies is Khosla Ventures, an investor in Blockstream and Chain. Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla, said the firm’s investments were based on the conviction that the block chain would alter the way society thought about transactions — financial or otherwise.
“Anytime there’s a broker — anytime there’s an expert attesting to the validity of something — all of that could be obviated by the block chain,” Mr. Rabois said. “It’s not a guaranteed success, but the upside is so large that as a venture investor, it’s an extremely attractive investment opportunity.”
Several start-ups are developing ways to transfer traditional money using the block chain in the hopes of streamlining financial transactions. One such company, Coins.ph, based in the Philippines, has seized on the block chain’s peer-to-peer technology as a way to improve the remittance business and global payments by lowering costs and speeding up transactions. The company’s goal is for people to use its services without having to understand the block chain, much as people send email without thinking about the Internet.
“The way I think of the block chain is a really modern infrastructure to move money around the globe,” said Marwan Forzley, the chief executive of Align Commerce, another start-up seeking to make cross-border payments easier.
Although companies focused on financial applications for the block chain far outnumber those experimenting with other uses, the gap is narrowing. For example, a start-up called BlockSign verifies signed documents on the block chain. Another company, Filecoin, is aiming to build a marketplace for storing data on the block chain.
PeerNova — which said it was planning to announce financing that would bring its total to about $20 million — is developing a technology that will use the block chain to prove the authenticity of a document, like a patent. The company is also toying with registry applications for other records, including title deeds and financial data.
“Our entire system of contracts is based on a trusted third party,” said Naveed Sherwani, the chief executive of PeerNova. But with the block chain, he added, “there is no third party anymore.”
With the rise of the block chain has come a fundamental question: Should technology replace human discretion? Some experts, even those who study cryptocurrency, are skeptical.
“There are very good reasons why we have legal and social institutions and economic intermediaries,” said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton who studies block-chain technology.
In his teaching, Professor Narayanan said he often used car ownership as an example. In theory, block-chain technology could eliminate the need for, among other inconveniences, title certificates and dealers to ensure the secure transfer of money and property. The idea initially sounds appealing, but if the car is broken or stolen, he said, the block chain alone will not be able to resolve the dispute.
“It’s not just one human you’re getting rid of, but the entire economic, legal and social structure that reinforces the idea of property,” he said.
There is also still broad support for Bitcoin. Many investors and entrepreneurs maintain that Bitcoin will outgrow its early role as a speculative investment and become a viable alternative currency for international payments. Others see countries turning to Bitcoin when their own currency is unstable.
The virtual currency must also maintain some value for the network to work. Bitcoin miners, the computers that drive the block chain, win Bitcoins if they successfully solve complex cryptographic problems. If Bitcoin’s value continues to drop, it could become too expensive to keep the computers running.
But there are also those wary of moving too fast. Though enthusiastic about the block chain’s potential, a group of Bitcoin supporters, many of them early adopters, wants start-ups to focus first on strengthening existing Bitcoin applications, like digital wallets and trading platforms, before developing other uses for the underlying technology. Exchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars, euros and other currencies, have been especially vulnerable. Anxiety from the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, a prominent exchange based in Japan, is still high. And a security breach in January at Bitstamp, another exchange, sent further ripples of doubt through the Bitcoin industry.
“People are rightfully talking about the block chain,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in a number of Bitcoin start-ups, including Blockchain, a digital-wallet provider and software developer, and BTCChina, a Chinese exchange. “The question is how do you realize the first opportunity here?”
“You can’t jump to the top of the stairs,” he added. “Everything is a process.”

For the blockchain to serve valuable purposes, it has to be secure. Your point is valid that some level of security would remain even with a significant drop in price. But it would not be enough if the other blockchain applications became, as is hoped, very valuable themselves.

The issue for me is the size of the increase, 1 MB to 20 MB (to 16.7 MB to be precise). On top of this is a planned doubling every two years (every 105120 blocks to be precise) for ten times. We should not go straight to 20 MB just as we should not go straight to the end goal of 20 GB (of 2^34 B to be precise). A smaller step of 4 or 8X near term would be better.

A valid block has to 1) contain information from the previous block and 2) have a header that hashes to a sufficiently small 256-bit number.

Also, if you run your own full node wallet, you don't have to trust. Your wallet builds directly on the secure Bitcoin infrastructure.
