I guess it might be a 1 in 21 million change bug, but it's better to be on the safe side. 
I would do the following.
- Make a backup right now of your multibit folder. 
- Don't create 500 addresses.
- Count the number of receive addresses you have.
- Export your private keys on a *secure* computer.
- Count if you have the same number of private addresses as receive addresses. If it's the same number, you're in the clear. 
- Shred the just exported file with the private addresses.
- Don't create new receive addresses.
Watch from updates from other persons than the 2 main devs. (and Or wait until Multibit mentions for an upgrade.

The NSA currently could be called the root of most hacking. Certainly after exposing that Heartbleed had been known and abused for over 2 years. 
Also with a couple of million of people having top secret clearance, it way too easy to infiltrate the NSA or other agency. Organized crime only has put pressure on one of these sub contractors and they have more than enough information. They would need to do their own hacking because the NSA is doing it for them on behalf of the US taxpayer.

It shouldn't be too hard to handle the BTC yourself. 
* Just place a computer with 2 monitors at the counter. 
* Issue a new address for each purchase and let a client like Multibit create a receiving QR code with the amount coded in. 
* Everybody can us their smartpone (except iPhones) to pay by scanning the QR code.
* Wait until the BTC arrives after a purchase in a couple of seconds. 
You can even add a cash-to-BTC machine at the front of the store. 
Every hour or so you transfer all the received BTC to a more secure wallet or convert to fiat. 
I think this solution will take a day or so to set up. After that you're good to go until this mess is sorted out.

If the currecy collapses, the debt will also become worthless. You will be able to pay of your mortgage and buy a loaf of bread with the same amount of money. If your salary increases to counter the inflation. 
That was the reason I did buy a house versus renting one. The interest is fixed for 20 years and I keep on paying the same amount in interest and life insurance. If we can keep up growth, my salary should increase each year. While with renting the rent would rise just as much as inflation. Your on year, a smaller portion of my salary goes to the mortgage. Unfortunately, maintenance will still rise with inflation.
If we cannot keep up growth (as it looks like now), don't get in over your head with the mortgage. Keep the interest rate fixed and invest in something that keeps it value in face of inflation.
The bad part is of course, that the mortgage debt creates money that will be invested in stuff that I have no control over.

Sorry for the late reaction but I needed some time think about this. 
Capitalism works at this moment. But the outputs are completely skewed in our current system. Which undermines functioning markets that can take care of everybody. 
After more than 100 years of capitalism we have the inverse situation then were we started. Resources have become much scarcer, while money and labour are plenty available. Every person that is unemployed forms a supply of labour at this moment. However our tax laws have not adapted to this situation. We tax labour, while there's enough labour to go around. There's almost no tax on resources, while these are getting more scarce. It would be better to adapt this to the current situation. 
Capitalism does nothing on resource flows currently. It only handles the allocation on materials based on: This is what I have and this is the price. With the end goal of creating more profit. Which is actually a very information poor environment. This works in an environment where a lot of material is available and labor is scarce.  
Something like the 19th century. 
This kind of crude system worked better than feudalism and central planning because there was more competition possible. The products weren't that complex.  
Now during the 2nd half of the 20th century, the high margin products have become much more complex and you see automatic oligopoly forming. Just look at the car, smartphone and tablet market. Only a couple of players are left. These companies earn much more than other commodity makers and people rather invest in these companies. 
Also the profit motive creates 'externalities' which makes sure some aspects in the real world will be left behind.  These currently translate in poor working condition in the 3rd world, climate change, resource scarcity, hunger, forced prostitution, pollution, financial crashes, diseases, lack of education, etc. 
At the moment Capitalism is working really good at amassing more money into the rich peoples pockets, which then can buy the government they need. Add to this the complete financial industry, which means creating money using money on a global market. Thus extracting wealth from the real world via inflation. With their investments they also direct which products will be made and that necessarily doesn't mean that will be the products that people need most.  These markets have become completely disfunctional and fallen prey to speculators. See the food riots and Arabic spring that resulted from increasing oil prices. In the first world you see that the money goes to other rent seekers and not to companies that actually produce something usefull. 
This results in a complete disaster for the people who don't have much capital. 
In order to get the smokeless cooking stoves, you would actually need a good market that could make them and people that earned money to invest in them. 
To create these markets we could adjust the playing field to our current predicament. 
* Design an open source smokeless cooking stove to make it interesting for multiple parties to build and distribute these. 
* There's enough labour available but it's taxed too high so it's cheaper to automate, so tax this less. 
* Tax capital and resources more. So more money will be invested in people, instead of capital goods or financial investments. 
This would make it more affordable to make and distribute the smokeless cooking stove and make sure that enough will be build. This will also give a boost towards a circular economy that recycles it's used resources. However exponential innovation in automation will still offset these measures in the end. But it would do in the mean time. 
For more information on adapting taxes to our current abundance and scarcity paradigms see the ex-tax (idea originally from Eckhard Wintzen (RIP))
Sorry for the long rant.
tl;dr: Capitalism works to create profit for few nowaday. Could work somehat if we change the rules wrt. resources, profit and available labour.

Thank you for your elaborate answer. First of all, I'm from Europe not Murica. 
I agree with you that the US Army performs as an unstoppable force against civilians in open battle. Also the current struggles in Ferguson and other cities show that controlling a population is somewhat different than winning battles. I think our 'Dutch Approach' in AFghanisatan worked a lot better, than the methods from other countries. 
That's another pioint where US has proven their weakness the last couple of years. The last campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan did not meet their strategic objectives and the place is a mess after 15 years. 
Another issue poses a big problem in the US. The USA remains build on nationalism, a belief in the constitution and the American Dream.  The American Dream has been in shambles since 2008. If large scale actions escalate on US soil, the belief in the constitution and 'land of the free' will also quickly deteriorate. Which results in a lot of ethnic, religious and class rifts to become more important for a lot of people and the US runs the risc of civil war. 
Which will eventually end up in different trained army elements on either side. If the US fails as a nation, then the soldiers would like to fight for their own club, not the nation. Which they can do because they're backed by wealthy citizens that would like to remain in the back seat of the conflict. So you have the whole iraqi war-zone at home then. Also remember that the US contains a lot of religious whack-jobs, who could inspire people to become a suicide bombers to 'repent' for their sins. 
And then you still have the whole local militia's that can be upgraded somewhat for other jobs. It might not be much, but it helps. 
tl;dr: I agree that a modern army can stomp over any militia. But you need more than an army to control the population and keep a nation together.

By using the blockchain hype, they have finally consensus amongst their peers to ditch the protocol and technologies from the 70s. 
The functionality might in the end just resemble a shared database with automatic backups. But now on new fresh protocols and technologies. 
As with most proprietary projects amongst several parties, it will go down in flames. Every party wants all their wishes granted and add an extra kitchensink. Which will make the new system cumbersume and obsolete. Just like compuserve and AOL at first.
Then they will start using the real Bitcoin blockchain.

See this presentation about promoting and adopting new technologies. It concerns here Ethereum, but it still fits the current bitcoin situation quite good.

Sell/donate all the hardware. Keep the bitcoins for Long Term storage.

The US does this regularly. Finance and help the poorer states using profits from the riches states. Nobody bats an eye about this because the USA remains a political union. 
The EU poses as an economical union and thinks that member countries should compete with each other.

The end of the downward spiral would look like civil war. Tee hard part is going back upwards without going fully to the bottom. That means making tough choices by people who still have money. 
But in the first world countries we see the same choices with climate change, peak-oil and resource scarcity. US needs to cut resource consumption 8 times and the EU around 4 times to live within 1 earth of consumption. I don't see this happening in the near future on a voluntary basis.

The EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) has been going down the last couple of years and our economy can't handle that. An oil price of 150 USD almost destroyed our economy. Shale oil needs an oil price above 60 or 70 USD which costs too much to keep the Chinese economy going. 
So peak-oil means that oil becomes too expensive to do useless stuff with it. Gail gail tverberg  writes about this quite extensively.
Fortunately renewable sources like solar and geothermal could take over, but this will still take decades. With only 1 billion people we're already wrecking the planet. So limiting our energy use while not going down to 3rd world situations will remain a big challenge.

I think your girlfriend is indeed worried about your future and security and think your current job is the only method for guaranteeing that. 
On the other hand. Maybe your happiness should come before getting lots of money. Because people don't become that much happier after the money gives them some security. Also work that motivates you and makes you more happy, will make you both more successful and happy in the end. 
This extra time you have because of lower stress allows you to create an extra income stream that provides even more security. I think that Bitcoin is a good bet, to act as that secondary income stream.

He also said that, that they got one very lucky break and they landed on top by accident. But it won't last and you need to capitalize on that lucky break and diversify. For TomTom the primary goal is now achieved. Everybody can navigate their car. They now need to focus on something else that's based on their current assets. 
The same is true for the fresh Bitcoin millionaire. You got one lucky shot and you can ride it for a little while longer. BTC adoption is still under 1 %, so it still can go anywhere between 0 and everything.

The article forgets to mention to also import the change addresses that are used for all the sent addresses. Bitcoin-qt seems to create and use randomly about 99 change adresses so if you have a lot of outgoing transactions, this will require quite a large amount of work. 
So Multibit will indicate a lower balance than the bitcoin addresses. 
You can do this using the following method:
- Import all data in multibit and check for all outgoing transactions if there are mismatches between bitcoin-qt and multibit. 
- The address that's not the intended recipient is your own change address used in this case.
- Extract the private key for this change address and add it to the list of imported addresses. 
- Rebuild all transactions to get the correct balance.

I already thought something like that. 
This is the scheme that I thought what was going on. 
This is someone with deep pockets (60.2 M EUR) and a lot of Bitcoins wants to scare everybody else into buying BTC when the market correction happends. 
Everybody is now issuing buy orders just above the asking price of the 100k in a panic move. If that buy order goes through, the market is deprived of 100k BTC. Thus increasing the price. 
When the price goes down, to what I believe is a sane value (55 EUR) instead of the 60 EUR he is asking. He just cancels the order and everybody buys bitcoins from him for a higher price than what the rest of the market is doing (i.e. MTGOX). 
If he didn post the buy order, everybody would be sitting out the coming drop and buy cheaper.

I think 100 years is a really long time. The BRICS countries might already take over within that time frame. I'm not sticking around here if everything fall apart. So it's nice if you have some of your wealth in a currency that's based on cryptography and not on trust in a private bank. 
Both EUR and USD are inherently unstable because of interest. Bretton Woods is also coming to an end and that might cause some turmoil.  USD won't remain the world reserve currency for a 100 years. A lot of resource trading already happens in other currencies than USD.
