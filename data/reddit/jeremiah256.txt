When it becomes mainstream to keep about $100 in BTC for those occasions when you want to transfer money between family and friends.

I immediately thought of Spice from the book Dune.

Haven't you heard?  Evolution is not a popular term in America :-)  
Bitcoin is too unforgiving of mistakes for the average person to use in their daily lives.  The public, in general, has not had to suffer greatly, the consequences of their lack of understanding of security.  If a hacker got into their Facebook page because they used Moneky1234 as their password, they might have suffered spamming or defacement.  Having the eWallet with the money they were planning to send to their aunt in the Philippines emptied, would be another matter totally.  No call from Visa to confirm the charges are valid.  No Federally mandated recourse.  They would be screwed.  The average joe may talk a big game about being all bootstrappy, wave his "Don't Tread On Me" flag and scream for the government to just leave him alone, but in reality, we'd see an unending media show of people weeping before Congress on how they have to do something to protect them from hackers and also complain about how heartless people like buttadmiral are and that's why Bitcoin is bad.
I have no idea on the solution, but I think OP is right about the problem.

It's the ideology part of your statement that too many in the mainstream media don't understand.  I feel the same way.  I don't want Bitcoin to destroy fiat currency, but I do want it or digital currency in general, to be a force that empowers the average world citizen.

Final wrapup request:
1.  Register with FINCEN
2.  Implement controls and protections for your exchange
3.  Maintain records
Need to grab some BITCOINs because the big boys are now going to start playing.  Nothing at this meeting threatened BITCOIN.

Cash money decreases with time whereas OP is assuming Bitcoin increases.  Replace Bitcoin with gold to see OP's point of view.

The reason half of all lotto winners go broke is that they don't put their money to work for them.

I frigging love the comment by James M. Ray, "The fact that there's no "real" Satoshi isn't a bug, it's a feature. The reason BTC hasn't already been attacked &amp; shut down for allowing the Silk Road to exist is that very leaderlessness.  Bitcoin is karma for the e-gold case's injustice."  I practically purred with pleasure on reading this.

Dude, you have my sympathies.  Yahoo! Boards are worst than almost anything to read.

Western Union?  The company that laughed when offered the patient for the telephone in the 1800's?

Calling BS.  There is no major bank crisis coming that would be classified as a national security level event, warranting seizing savings.  And even if there was:
You don't pull on Superman's cape.  You don't spit in the wind. You don't pull the mask  off the ole Lone Ranger and don't confiscate the savings of a nation with 300 million guns. 
The bailout was barely tolerated by the public and many politicians paid the price for it.  Some were spit upon and hounded out of office because of their vote.  A direct confiscation would result in a level of chaos and anger that is hard to imagine.  Cops, federal agents, the military all have bank accounts.  Even if you consider them a part of the 'The Man', there's no way they stand against their own self interests or the interests of their family and friends.

But they didn't have a choice with the Fed.  It was thrust upon them, trust or not.  Bitcoin is voluntary and needs trust if it is to go mainstream.

Very interesting article.  Thank you.  But unless there is a serious collapse, System D is not something that will be the dominate economy in Western nations or other larger markets.  If this started to happen in the United States on a large scale, it would be easy for politician to scapegoat these people as takers who won't pay their fare share.

I see Bitcoin one day replacing services like Western Union and PayPal, but the average person wants the unthinking security that banks provide.  My guess is Bitcoin will level out one day, far short of its potential but still high enough that if you bought it at $100, in a few years you'd still make a nice profit.

How in world is any bank or industry allowed to surpass the GDP of its country?   What people believe this is sane or not a threat to national security?

Does this mean that Bitcoin Exchanges will have to have their users register?

Posting this so that when I get some Bitcoin this weekend, I can tip you.

Can the exchange rate be suppressed if media and governments discourage mainstream merchants from ever accepting Bitcoins?

What is a 51% attack?
Edit: Found it.  An attack by the majority of miners/computing power in a effort to game the system.

Claim Bitcoin is a threat to national security because it allows terrorist to move and launder funds.  Politician pass rules that create additional burdens for brick and mortar businesses that want accept Bitcoin.

Very welcome.  Only bought $20 through Bitinstant, waiting to set up a bank account this weekend. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:34:24
Just make a separate account just for Bitcoin transactions.  Make it your spare change, birthday money from grandma, All State refund check account.
