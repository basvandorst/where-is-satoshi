If that were possible, bitcoin would be broken.  It cannot function in that environment.  The whole system would be vulnerable, and all funds sitting in addresses where a spend has taken place would be available to steal by anyone.
That's a completely bullshit claim.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:28:02
I agree with you, but the only advantage I can see is saying to bitfinex, I'll give you back 75% if you give me the remaining 25% equivalent in Monero.
Then he can slowly convert from Monero to bitcoin via shapeshift or something similar, and no one will ever be able to trace the money to him.
He can then retire comfortably on an island somewhere without fear of his transactions being tracked on the blockchain.

@_date: 2016-08-05 00:14:36
I guess you missed the point. While this safeguard was a violation of some bullshit regulation, it kept funds safe. 
The CFTC forced them to stop doing this. Because of that, all funds became vulnerable.  The regulation made this theft orders of magnitude bigger than it would have otherwise been. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:50:45
Good point.  I was just thinking of some potentially plausible scenarios off the top of my head.  Obviously this amount is too large for this to work.
But it could potentially work in a smaller amount, and also with some other anonymous altcoins too.

Does bitsquare do non-fiat exchanges?  Like BTC -&gt; ETC or something like that?
If so, can you walk me through how the transaction goes?  I'm assuming 2 sets of multisig addresses, once for each coin?  Arbitrator needed only if someone claims fraud?
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:04:12
Yes, that's not an ECDSA vulnerability.  That's exploiting shitty code, most notably implemented by blockchain.info.
The guy's claim was that through a public key, he could figure out a private key.  That's 100% horseshit.  Many more pieces of information are required.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:01:13
I'm failing to see how this makes you more anonymous.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:02:11
That guy interviewing him was a douche though.
I'd love to see him obtain a private key just from a tx on the blockchain.  That's a completely bullshit claim.  If he was able to do that, he'd be able to steal millions of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:32:58
Regardless though, what about other trying to spend these stolen coins?
As I pointed out, it would be trivial for him to spend a few hundred thousand or even a few millions dollars and just send some stolen funds to other bitcoin users.  Would all of them then be blacklisted as well?
Obviously not.  Which is why blacklists don't work.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:17:23
Yes, but the point is that this is an upper bound.
One person can own many addresses, but each address is (high likely) only owned by one person.
Which means that *at most*, 140,000 people own 91% of all bitcoin.  Likely even less.  So your statement only intensifies the point of the tweet.

@_date: 2016-08-03 21:32:45


I brought that up.  If you think that an exchange would refuse to accept any deposits from any address tainted with even a single satoshi of the stolen coins, then what stops me from purposely tainting millions of bitcoin addresses?  In fact, why not just taint the hot wallet of an exchange by sending some stolen funds directly into it?  Or simply watch the blockchain and everyone who makes a transaction, taint both the sender and recipient with 50 cents each.  Do that for a few weeks.
How far does the taint reach?  Do you really think an exchange would then blacklist all the thousands or millions of people who now have some tainted coins mixed into their stash?
How are you going to differentiate a person who just happened to get sent some tainted coin vs the actual thief trying to spend some tainted coin?
This is why blacklists don't work.

Was there a decision today? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:19:31
ITT:  Lost of people who fail to understand the point the tweet was making.
Yes, people own more than one address.  That is beyond obvious.
140,000 addresses contain 91% of all bitcoin.  So *at most*, 140k people own 91% of all bitcoin, but likely a lot less than that.  By simply stating the obvious about person != address, you're only intensifying the point.

A theft that's avoidable if you stop trusting 3rd parties with your private keys.
I get it.  Victim blaming is generally bad.  But there's a difference between your house randomly getting robbed, and you handing your cash to someone you've never met, and telling them go walk around screaming "I have lots of money on me" at 2am in a dark alley in the bad part of town.

Obviously, if there are additional flaws, it would be possible, but to me it didn't seem like he was claiming that.
That seems irrelevant anyway.  He sounded like he was disputing a CW signature by saying "oh that's meaningless, anyone can get the private key from an address that has spent bitcoin, look I've done it thousands of times."  Then conveniently forgets to mention that he meant only if there are other additional known vulnerabilities.  That's a pretty damn important caveat.

Put all "stolen" funds in a single address.  Point to that address as the "hacker's address".
Slowly convert to Monero as needed, then convert back in different amounts.  Seems easy enough..
Not much for these "half a dozen analytics companies" to do..
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:07:35
Couldn't the attacker just split the funds into literally thousands, even millions of addresses?  Just put like $1 - $100 dollars in each address.  Mix some real users in there.  Send out like $20 million in very small amounts to random addresses with recent activity on them.  Even mix in some well known exchange hot wallets.  Send some to satoshi dice.  Send some to other gambling services.
How will any of that be tracked?  How will anyone be able to tell the difference between bitcoin he sent to himself and bitcoin he sent to a random address, especially if it's used?
Are you saying exchanges are now going to blacklist the thousands or millions of recipients who received a few bucks from the attacker?
Now he just has to slowly exchange some of it to Monero and back to bitcoin in different amounts.
How would that *not* work?
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:46:00
States are good at forcing people to use certain currencies.  They'll just force businesses to pay in that currency, and make direct deposit mandatory.  Or they'll freeze bank accounts, and when the banks re-open, everything is denominated in the new currency.
Avoid this by holding bitcoin :)

The consequences of this claim are monumental though.  Bitcoin would be completely broken. Do you understand the gravity of this?  If true, bitcoin would be completely dead. They'd have to hard fork immediately and change the encryption algorithm. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:10:53
The inability to scale is what's holding the price back.  It's beyond obvious.  The minute a meaningful scaling solution is implemented and released for production use, the price will skyrocket.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:41:10
So you're saying right now if the attacker sent me $100 in bitcoin, that I too would be blacklisted now?
This is my point.  How far deep does the blacklist go?  If he sent a satoshi to 100,000 addresses that currently have a balance, would exchanges blacklist all of those users too?  Obviously not.  So what's the difference between him sending $100 to me, or $100 to himself at a new address?  How can you tell the difference?
I believe with enough obfuscation, he would be able to exchange bitcoin for monero at an anonymous exchange, and pretty much be in the clear after that.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:40:49


Yes.  If you were able to obtain the private key from just the public key, then yes, not only bitcoin, but ECDSA in general would be completely broken.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:43:59


Right here: 


Instead of actually distributing bitcoins to/from each individual's wallet at the time of a trade, they simply updated ledgers in their database while bitcoin was held offline in cold storage.  Then, they maintained a small hot wallet to handle daily withdraws.
This is literally exactly what the CFTC forced them to stop doing.

Split into various wallets all containing ~$100.  Additionally, send ~$100 to thousands of other users (yes, giving away money to other people).
How can an exchange tell the difference between the $100 increments he gave away to other users, and the $100 increments he sent back to himself at a new address?  They can't.  So what would they do, blacklist everyone he gave $100 to?  Blacklists don't work for this reason.
Yes, this would decrease the amount of money he has in his control, but I think he'd be happy to safely get away with half of what he stole.

@_date: 2016-08-19 11:46:42
Immutability is something that a community must value.  For instance, there is no way in hell that bitcoin would hard fork just to censor previously valid transactions. 
The ETC community refused to participate in the hard fork specifically because they value immutability. 
This shows me that the ETC chain is extremely resistant to blockchain changes, even when large scale theft takes place.  On the other hand, the ETH community has no problem forking to change address balances. They don't care about immutability. They'll gladly abandon the current state of the blockchain, fuck around with who owns what, and censor smart contacts. 
If you don't understand that difference, I'd make the claim that you're being willfully ignorant about it.

They used to use a cold wallet system, which would have prevented an attack of this scale, since the keys wouldn't have been stored online anywhere.
It was regulation that forced to keep assets on the exchange.  They were specifically forced by regulators to abandon their cold wallet system.

I would say that that transaction you referenced was not valid.  It did not adhere to the rules of bitcoin consensus (regarding the supply limit).  It was rolled back because of this.  I don't see a problem, and I don't believe that breaks immutability.
Regardless, let's try to stay on topic.  You changed your argument from being about ETC to being about bitcoin.  You were asking specifically about the difference between ETH and ETC, then we got off-topic.
Can you address my earlier comment?  The one you ignored?  Specifically this:

Honestly, the only thing I can think of is that he did do that, and the interviewer didn't believe him. 
The interviewer was claiming that it's possible to obtain a private key just from an exposed public key from a tx output on the blockchain, which is complete horseshit. 
Craig definitely looks foolish in this video, but the context is really bizarre.  It almost seems as if it's happening after he signed a message, which could explain his anger.

I would say this is the worst case scenario for Lightning; the hub and spoke model.
However, even if this does occur, it's still better than the "custodial trust" model that we see today.  Exchanges, mining pools, payment processors, etc, all rely on third party custodial trust.  Those are centralized solutions.  It's the worst aspect of Bitcoin.  So if all we do is move from a centralized model *with* custodial trust, to a centralized hub and spoke Lightning model with no custodial trust, then we improved the bitcoin network dramatically.
However, I don't think we'll see that.  I believe the network topology will be decentralized.

LN doesn't really benefit you if you're only doing 1 tx a year.
But if you want to use bitcoin regularly, as a currency, to buy things daily, weekly, or monthly, you can go from having to pay fees on hundreds of txs, to only paying for 2 txs.
If you can't see the benefit in that, you're intentionally ignoring it.

That's not possible. By "engaging in off chain txs" he is already signing them. Every LN tx is a signed bitcoin tx. 
If the other guy wants to close the channel, he just broadcasts the last LN tx sent to him. When it hits the blockchain, it settles all off chain txs that took place.

Bitcoin fees are a per byte basis, not percentage of value transacted as with Coinbase.
So if you send $20 for a $20 fee, that's a 100% fee.  If you send $1,000,000 for $20, that's a 0.002% fee.
Long story short, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.  The reality is that onchain bitcoin payments aren't great for micro-transactions.  That's what Lightning is for.

Bitcoin miners use energy to accomplish a goal.  Have you ever thought of how much energy goes into the traditional money system?

Think of spending bitcoin like a solving a puzzle.  When you send bitcoin, you're locking it up in a way that says "whoever can prove they have the private key that corresponds to this public address can spend this".
This is the bitcoin scripting language, and it allows for a lot more than just sending to an address.  In reality, the addresses are meaningless to bitcoin.  I can send a tx that says "provide a phrase whose SHA-256 hash is djc...29f".  Anyone can spend that, if they have the phrase.  You can technically send that to your friend, if only he knows the phrase.
Segwit is just a different style puzzle than the legacy addresses.  It's all supported by the protocol, and there are a million other ways you can send bitcoin.  It's just that sending to a public key hash is popular.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:29:29

That's the million dollar question.  We've tried measuring it through miners, but that obviously doesn't work any more.  Considering that &gt;90% of miners were signaling for Segwit2x, yet that fork failed.
Others have also tried node counting, but that's a crappy metric, because anyone can spin up 500 nodes pretty quickly.
This question is why bitcoin developers have held off making hard fork changes.  They don't know how to properly determine support levels.
I think node counting can be made better if you exclude nodes hosted at Amazon, and only include nodes that have been running for at least 3 months.  That would be a better metric, but still not perfect.

Using banks require third party trust; using Lightning is completely trustless.  Banks have custodial control of users' funds; Lightning hubs have no custodial control at all.  Banks use a fractional reserve system; Lightning hubs have 100% reserves.  Banks are centralized; Lightning hubs are decentralized.  Banks can garnish your funds if directed by the government, without approval from you; with Lightning, every single tx needs a signature from your private key.
So how exactly does Lightning look "exactly like a bank"?

Your entire premise relies on this "if".  That's why I called it nonsense.
I'll gladly pay $20 to open up a channel with $1000 that I can use to make an infinite number of payments to many different merchants.
Also, widespread segwit usage will increase throughput and reduce fees.  Right now segwit usage is only at 10%.  Once it hits 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% etc, fees will come down, because blocks will fit up to triple the number of txs as they do now, significantly reducing the mempool and keeping it small.

We're talking about a philosophy.  You are pretending the libertarian philosophy is consistent with corporations "fucking people over".  I explained why that isn't true.
First of all, corporations are an extension of the state.  They only exist as "limited liability" organizations because the state has created this legal construct and exempted them from standard liability laws.  So without a state, there would be no such things as "corporations" as they exist today.


Before we move on further, when you say "libertarian" are you referring to [minarchism]( or [anarcho-capitalism](  Because there's a difference.  If you're making an argument that "there is no state", then I assume you're talking about the latter.  However, most people, including the subreddit, would consider minarchy more synonymous with "libertarian".  So please clarify, then we can continue.
Last, in an ancap society, I'd argue that we'd still be very well protected by private defense agencies (PDAs).  In society today, police have no incentive to help or protect anyone.  They get paid regardless of whether you live or die.  There is no recourse at all, and no competition among providers.  In an ancap society, PDAs would have an incentive to provide good service, because competition would force them to.

GB, but that's irrelevant.  Sure a single GB sized block can be broadcast easily in a test environment.  But now you're expecting all bitcoin users to store that on disk, and upload it to all their peers.  Over the course of a year, they'd need 52 TBs (drives that large don't exist), and even more bandwidth, which also doesn't exist for residential users.
The bottom line is that raising the block size isn't a solution.  It's a stall tactic.  Scaling via layers is a real long-term solution.

So like I said, if you want to become an active member of the Bitcoin economy, and do dozens or hundreds of sub-penny txs, all instantly, then Lightning is the answer.
If you only want to do a single tx every few months, then continue doing what you're doing.  The choice is yours. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:37:12


That's not true.  Profit = Revenue - Costs.  When you become more efficient, and reduce your costs, that increases your profit.  You're ignoring costs in your scenario, and pretending that increasing revenue is the only way in increase profit.


I'm not opposed to slightly larger blocks.  But the process for getting their is the downside.  I don't want Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin 2x chains.  I think this will dilute Bitcoin's network effect.
Let's use the tools we have available right now, and more than double the blocksize.  Once LN is used, we get even more throughput.  Then we can start talking about long term plans to increase the base blocksize.

If you haven't seen "proof", then you have never read a single thing about the Lightning network.
The proof is in the design.  It's actually very simple.  When you create a Lightning channel, you're simply moving your funds to an address that will automatically refund you if X time runs out.  If you never do anything again after opening the channel, you get your money back.  No one can stop that.
However, this address can also be controlled by 2-of-2 multisig address, with the two parties being you and the person you opened the channel with.  So if you guys want to work together and enjoy many off-chain payments, you can.  But if either of you want to close the channel, you both can, but only with the final state of the channel, which you both signed off on.
Every single Lighting tx requires your signature, just like a Bitcoin tx.
What form do you want this proof in?  The whitepaper?  The source code?  Videos explaining how it works?  The interoperability specification? You pick.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:17:56
I can't wait to open up a couple channels on mainnet.  Having channels open will allow you to transact all over the world, thousands of times, for practically no fee.  The only fees will be opening and closing channels.  So if you divide those fees by how many txs you do, they come out to near 0 for each one.

LN doesn't have its own blockchain.  The bitcoin blockchain is its blockchain.
All a lightning network is, is a way to trade signed bitcoin transactions without immediately broadcasting them to the blockchain.  They're as good as bitcoin, since they can be broadcast at any time.  Transactions are updated as balances within each payment channel change.  It's eventually broadcast on the blockchain to close the channel.

Your Lightning wallet will handle all that for you.  It'll be transparent.  You won't have to worry about keeping track of payment channel states, or worrying about updating anything or signing transactions.  It's all handled behind the scenes.

This is just 100%.  No model of Lightning relies on third parties holding your private key.  You're either maliciously lying, or you're completely ignorant to how Lightning works.


This sentence makes no sense.  Lightning is a specification.  There is no concept of third party trust, fractional reserves, lending, or custodial control built into the spec.  So Lighting cannot become used "like banks".  I think you're severely confused.  It's not a criticism of the network just because you personally aren't capable of envisioning how it works.

Satoshi's own words:


 They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving
money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops
agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If
desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1
parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do
not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the
network.

The Bitcoin Core wallet will now have built in native segwit support, including bech32 addresses (new address style that start with bc1).
Why it's big is because any merchant or exchange that uses Bitcoin Core as their backend can now generate segwit address instead of legacy addresses.  This will allow blocks to fit more txs (up to a practical maximum of about 3.7mb), clearing out the mempool faster, and keeping fees lower.

No you didn't explain that.  If this is your hypothesis, then state it, and explain why you think so.  You never once did that.


And I still say you didn't dispute anything I said.  Lightning is decentralized, meaning there is no single point of failure, and no central authority that presents is a single point of attack.  Clients in Lightning connect to one another to form a mesh network, exactly like bitcoin nodes do.
Additionally, there is no third party custodial trust.  This was part of my original point, which you still haven't acknowledged.  Hal envisioned a centralized 2nd layer for payemnts, requiring 3rd party trust.  I said that we did him one better.  He was right about needing a 2nd layer for payments, but we were able to develop a decentralized network, requiring no third party trust.
If you disagree with something I said, then quote me, and dispute it.  But you haven't done that yet.

It seems like you don't really use cryptocurrencies at all.  Why are you even concerned if you only do 1 tx a year?  Or maybe you've only done one ever.  Either way, you don't seem to be a Bitcoin user.
If you ever want to be part of Bitcoin, and actually use it, then Lightning is the obvious answer.  Unlimited txs, all instant, fees less than a penny.  But if you want to just sit on the sideline, and never actually use it, then be my guest.  But Lightning was made for people who want to actually engage in the Bitcoin economy, who actually make txs regularly.  People who buy things with Bitcoin, who trade in Bitcoin, who earn in Bitcoin.
We'll be here if you ever want to participate.  But if you are only interested in making a single tx every few months, then continue to just do that the way you always have.
Lightning was designed for active users who want to do lots of cheap txs instantly.

I'm aware that previous states can be broadcast, and it's on you to combat that by bradcasting the latest state.  But that's not what was originally asked.
When the channel is initially funded, your entire balance will refund to you if no other action is taken.  So by just opening up the channel, there are no other channel states.  So there is absolutely no risk.

Are you new around here?  Because we just saw what happens when only miners support a hard fork.  It's called Segwit2x, and it failed.  Miners are beholden to users, because their income depends on it.  Without user support, miners will bail on forking, because it means they loose all their revenue.


Loool..  What are you even talking about?  This has been tried.  Look at Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Segwit2x.  Look at BitcoinXT.  Those were developers attempting to change the Bitcoin protocol.  What happened?  They are all worth much, much less than Bitcoin.  Developers can make changes all day, but unless the bitcoin community adopts those changes, then they are meaningless.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:36:49

I would not agree with that at all.  Every user on the Lightning network also acts as a hub.  So no.  Everyone's client is routing payments for others constantly.

This is asinine.  No one is going to be opening half-million dollar payment channels.  If you're spending that much money, you don't care about $5 fees on the blockchain.
However, if you want to make regular $2 purchases with Bitcoin, it makes no sense to do it on-chain because the fees are too high.  *This* is what Lightning is for.  So yes, you will be opening a 0.5 BTC channel with Starbucks.  Except it'll likely be 0.05 BTC or less.


Nothing about Lightning incentivizes users to hand over their private keys.  You're talking out of your ass again.


How is this even an argument?  Yes, to enjoy the benefits of Lightning, you have to actually use it...
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:14:12
No.  Blockstream wrote an open-source lightning implementation called c-lightning.  But you don't have to use that client.  There are at least 2 other open-source implementations (Eclair, and LND) that you can choose to use, and they are all compatible with each other.
The Lightning network is an open-standard.  There is no third party trust, and any developer is free to write their own client and integrate into the network.

@_date: 2018-01-19 02:55:12
That doesn't make any sense. There's no benefit to open a channel just to make one tx, then close it. The point is to open a channel, use it regularly for weeks, then close it.
Remember that you can pay anyone on the network, not just the party you've opened a channel with.

Ok, that directly contradicts your initial point.  Your initial point was that segwit was bad because it relied on millions of users to change behavior.  Now you're admitting that a blocksize increase requires the same thing.
The upside of segwit is that it's optional, keeping the network whole.  The downside of the hard fork is that it's mandatory, and the network will split for those who don't upgrade.

@_date: 2018-01-19 02:58:50
Theoretically, there could be a bug. But that's why there is so much testing happening.
Opening and closing a channel are regular on-chain bitcoin txs, so normal fees apply. But once you open a channel, you can make hundreds or thousands of payments to anyone on the network, not just the party you have a channel with. They all settle with a single tx to close the channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:45:33
But the orignal question didn't have anything to do with this.  The original question asked whether this company can run off with your funds if you open a Lightning channel with them.
You said that they can.  But they can't.  By just opening up a channel, there is only one state, which says that the balance you deposited is 100% yours.
Only if you start receiving payments can this attack vector be used.  If you've only made payments, then previous channel states will *benefit* you, and your balance is still not vulnerable to attack.
You left out all of this info, and pretended like his funds are at risk by simply opening up a Lightning channel.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:42:02


Yes, that is true.  But that still doesn't have anything to do with having to open 100 channels.  Lightning is a payment network.  used to buy coffee or other stuff.  A network to offload low value txs from the blockchain.


You need to be online.  You know what device is always online?  Your smartphone.


Yes.  You'd have to be insane to turn your private keys over to a third party.  That's ludicrous, and in no way would I ever recommend that to anyone, under any circumstances.  Lighting was not designed with this in mind.  The whole point was to be a trustless, decentralized network.  Too many people today rely on centralized models requiring third party trust (holding funds on exchanges).  Lightning will significantly improve security for millions of bitcoin users.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:27:26
No, you can't derive the channel state automatically from just a private key (seed).
If your computer crashes and you lose your channel state, theoretically, the other party in your channel, if malicious, can hack his Lightning client and force it to broadcast an old channel state which may be beneficial to him.
However, he can only broadcast channel states that you have signed off on.  He can't forge your digital signature from your private key.  Additionally, if you are the consumer, old channel states would be beneficial to you, since you are likely paying the merchant more and more with each channel state update.
Likely this would just resolve itself by either the channel expiring, automatically broadcasting the legitimate final channel state, or by the merchant broadcasting the legitimate final channel state himself.  If he tries broadcasting an old channel state (malicious) you may be out of luck.  Although, how would he know you lost your private key?  He would have to be routinely known for broadcasting malicious channel states, and there is a penalty associated with that.  So it doesn't seem like a likely scenario, but it's still an interesting thought experiment.

It reminds me of those pictures of North Korean super highways, where there are like 12 lanes in each direction, yet there are about 2 cars an hour driving on it.
The funniest part is that the decisions from the North Korean government, and the BCH developers were likely based on identical logic.
"We'll make our highways bigger than anyone else in the world!  We'll be envied and respected by everyone!"  Instead they're mocked because of their comically low usage.

@_date: 2019-07-25 17:29:21


Taxation is theft.  I'm objectively not a lunatic.  If I were to mow your lawn, then demand you pay me for it, and tell you i'll lock you in a cage if you refuse to pay me, you'd likely call that extortion, which is a form of theft.
This is exactly how taxation works.  I'm given services that I never asked for, then my money is taken from me against my will, and I'm threatened with imprisonment if I figure out a way to avoid having my money taken from me.


Again, this is nothing but fearmongering.  People have been screaming about this for literally centuries.  I already linked you to the Luddites.  Automation is a good thing, and new jobs will be created as new industries that you can't fathom are created.  This is how the evolution of labor has happened for all of human history. 


Automation replaces the most rudimentary unskilled work in society, and new industries are created as a result.  Rinse and repeat.  Again, I look forward to this.  I don't fear it.

You're asking me to start central planning.  You have a million "what if" scenarios, and you want me to provide you with exactly how all of it will be handled in specific detail.  I nor anyone can give you the details you're looking for.
The market will sort out the details.  The point is that *if* these services are highly desired, then options will be available.
Whether it comes in the form of voluntary collectives (like a home owners association), private defense agencies, or an arm of your insurance company (who have an incentive to track down the thief to recover stolen goods as opposed to paying claims out of pocket), there are many ways these serviced can be provided to a community.
Like communities today, there will be great ones with low crime rates, and bad ones, with high crime rates.  Prices will adjust accordingly.  
I envision mortgage companies requiring you to be covered by some defense service before giving you a loan, much like they require insurance today.

I think they are mutually exclusive.  It's a capitalist system.  Look at how txs are processed.  It's not based on who needs their tx confirmed the most.  It's not based on first come first served.  It's literally based on whoever chooses to pay the most.
A socialist version of bitcoin would have wealth redistribution, where the highest account balances are partially redistributed to the lowest.  Txs would be processed in the order they were seen, regardless of how much you were willing to pay.
Bitcoin was designed as a capitalist libertarian concept.

Likely, I'd imagine that the current police work would be split into two different services. First would be emergency services, a 911 equivalent. If someone is breaking into your house, and you need someone with a gun to show up asap. This would have little to no market entry barrier. 
Second would be investigative services. You want them to track down who broke into your home while you were on vacation.  This could likely be a separate provider completely.
However I imagine that good insurance is more important to a theft victim than investigative services.
Info like criminal background histories would like be recorded via some third party, almost like credit reporting is done today. So all investigative companies would be able to pay for that info as needed.

By all means, if you're hodling bitcoin, you better be the only one with the private keys.

I'm not sure if you're just arguing semantics, or if you're unaware of the benefits of SW..
SW will separate the signature part of a tx to another data structure.  It's estimated that the signatures can be as much as 60% of total size.  This means that a typical tx of say 220bytes will only count for about 90bytes towards the block cap.  The gains are even larger with multisig and other larger tx types.
This will potentially allow 3-4 times as many tx per block as is allowed today.
It's definitely a scaling solution.

Lots of reasons.. No third party trust.  No merchant blacklisting.  No terms or conditions to agree to.  No currency restriction.  No product restrictions.  No fee structure.
Why would you want a third party to host your store?  Seems like a central point of failure.  
I don't want some third party to take a cut of my sale, have the ability to to freeze my account, potentially have access to me funds, or force me to agree to sell only the items they allow.


Then you fix it.  What if the government takes down the site hosting your store?
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:55:52


Ok.  Did I say it had resource requirements *different* from raising the blocksize?  I don't see how this is relevant at all.


Ok, so you're just arguing semantics.  While neither options are really long term scaling solutions, both one-time blocksize increases and SW do provide short term relief from congested blocks.

Once the segwit softfork is complete, it's still going to take months upon months for any wallets to implement it.  There will be no increase in throughput until that happens.

1. You can't choose not to eat, or put a roof over your head, or a thousand other things, just because you think prices might be lower tomorrow.
2. Why isn't the inverse of that true?  In an inflationary market, why would a seller sell anything if he knows he can raise prices tomorrow? The reality is that life goes on, and a steady deflation at a percent or two a year isn't noticeable (just like a percent of two of inflation each year isn't really noticeable).  People will spend just as regularly.  However, with a fixed money supply, their wealth will grow over time, instead of shrink like it does with inflation.
3. Bitcoin isn't the only currency!  This is the most important aspect.  Your arguments only support the case of bitcoin being the *only* currency.  There will still always be inflationary government fiat money.  So prices will rise in that currency just like they do today.  So explain how having a secondary deflationary currency will hinder growth now.

Tax evasion doesn't create debt; borrowing does.  I don't advocate taxation, but if Greece wanted to fix that, they could have just enforced taxation.  No one forced them to borrow more money than they ever had the ability to repay.  Again, their insane amounts of debt is what caused their problem.

I never advocated it as a solution.  I specifically said, this won't help the government's problems.
Additionally, this isn't illegal tax evasion.  Greece is taxing bank withdraws.  If you don't have a bank account, you avoid that tax.  There is nothing illegal about that.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:10:41


They wouldn't rather do that.  Greek deposits have been plummeting for months on end.  No one is using the banks for any significant cash storage in Greece right now.  Also, withdraws are now taxed in Greece.  You can legally avoid that tax if you don't have an account.  Additionally, there are lots of uncertainties coming.  You say this isn't Cyprus, but I believe it's going to be worse.  Cyprus closed the banks, and when they reopened, accounts had money missing.  They gave it a cute euphemism called a "haircut".  What Greece is going to see is even worse.
IMO, Greece is going back to the Drachma.  How that will happen is that they'll close the banks for a time, figure out a conversion rate, then when they reopen the banks, you won't see Euro.  You'll see Drachma.  And you'll find that this Drachma buys you half as much as your Euro did.
Greek citizens are about to pay, big time.  If they want to preserve their wealth, they need to move to alternatives.  This is my only point here.  I'm talking about ways Greeks can preserve their wealth during this uncertain time.  And bitcoin (along with gold, and euro cash under their mattress) will help them with that.

Cash has always been the anonymous way to pay for something.  You can more easily buy things the state doesn't want you to own.  You can evade taxes a little easier, and not be tracked or blacklisted.
The future depicted in the article revolves around only government approved payment methods.  They want to be able to monitor all spending, then restrict the use of transactions depending on their goals.  Think about a world where only debit cards exist.  The government can then track, blacklist, freeze, or revoke your ability to pay for things.
This would create a powerful tool for oppression.

No one seems to get SegWit.  They think it's going to immediatly double or quadruple throughput..
That's not how it works.  First of all, it's going to take 3-6 months to test and merge.  Once the soft fork is finally done and it becomes part of the protocol, nothing changes.  It might take another year before any wallet software implements it.  The absolutely best case scenario is about 18 months from now before segwit actually helps increase transaction volume.

Ok. So what?  You could say the same thing about bitcoin.  What's the problem?  The internet is pretty decentralized.  Sure, improvements can be made, but that's true about everything.
The Silk Road was able to be shut down because it physically existed in one location.  There were dozens if not hundreds of sellers all operating individual "stores", but it was a classic ebay style centralized service.  You shut down the host, and everyone is shut down.
OB is the exact opposite.  You can't shut down OB.  There are no centralized servers.  Store fronts can move, or be hosted behind proxies or Tor.

Changing the max block size to 5mb vs 20mb doesn't do anything different in terms of average block size.  Blocks will continue to grow at their normal rate.
Every time a change is made like this, a hard fork is required.  If you only increase to say 5mb, that means we'll have to do another hard fork in a year or two.  Raising it to 20mb now buys more time for a permanent solution.

Even if segwit didn't use these "creative accounting tricks" to allow for more tx throughput, I'd still argue that it should be merged into bitcoin.  It solves many other problems, including tx malleability.  The fact that it also gives us some breathing room regarding scalability is just the cherry on top.

Well yes, when you ask about better tech in Bitcoin, it's going to be a big post.  my answer wasn't even complete.  It was just a list of obvious stuff from the top of my head.


How was that hard to respond to?  I simply answered your question.


Ok, read more about this.  It's not "nearly" identical.  They just copied the specification and code from BIP143 (segwit).  I find it comical that your major example of bcsah having "better tech" than Bitcoin is that they copied Bitcoin's fix.  Lol.


There are countless bug fixes that go into Bitcoin at each release, many of which never end up making into the various bcash implementations.  This leaves bcash vulnerable to some obscure attacks.


The downside is my exact point from my previous comment, which you ignored.  It ensures that all forks can survive.  This also dramatically reduces blockchain security, since the same SHA256 miners are now split up among multiple chains.   So like I said, this is a *feature* of Satoshi's DAA.  But I love that the bcash supporters pretend to support his original vision.  I guess that marketing catch phrase is only applicable when it benefits you.  But when it makes things difficult, then you'll just change any part of satoshi's original design.  Comical.

You have to be trolling.  No one can be this ignorant.  There is no such thing as private ownership of companies in socialism.  What you mean to say is "if you, as a worker of a company, collectively own it with the other workers, then you're a socialist".  And then we'd agree.  But this is exactly why Venezuela is failing; because of the collective ownership of the means of production.  Venezuela operates as one large company.  The people collectively own all the industries that produce the goods.  This system is obviously mismanaged, because of a "tragedy of the commons" scenario, and the economic engine grinds to a halt.  Individuals are not free to produce, hire employees, and trade with one another freely.  This is why they're starving in the street.

I completely understand the distinction you're making.  But there is still a huge difference you're ignoring.  I wouldn't call a public company traded on the stock market "collectively owned".  It's still privately owned, there are just many partial owners.
In socialism, it's mandatory that everyone is part of the collective ownership.  Like Venezuela.  You can't opt out.  Everyone in the country collectively owns all the means of production.  You can't open up your own grocery store, import goods, hire employees, and sell them at market rates.  You are a collective owner of the federal grocery store, which has a monopoly on that service.  This is the exact problem, and the reason why they're starving.
Capitalism is the only way to solve their problems at this stage.  People need to be free to start up their own businesses, import goods in a free market, hire employees at market wages, re-invest profits, sell goods at market rates, etc.  As long as they refuse to allow individuals to be free market capitalists, the economy will suffer.

Soylent is $70 a month for 7 bags.  Each bag is 444g.  That's a cost of 2.25 cents a gram.
Ensure powder is [$8.99 for a 397 gram package](  That's 2.26 cents a gram.
I'm extremely surprised that the price is almost identical.

What about weapons?  Amazon sells switchblades.  Is the CEO personally responsible for the death of anyone stabbed with one of those knives?


I've sold a small handgun to a friend.  Both parties entered into the agreement voluntarily.  Who is the victim?


It's clear that you don't understand the point.  The act of the sale in inherently victimless.  Meaning, as long as both parties are willing participants, and no one is being coerced, there is no victim.  I can buy anthrax or plutonium for fun run some cool science experiments with it, then dispose of it responsibly.  Who would be the victim there?  No one, which means the act of buying or selling those things in inherently victimless.
Once someone uses these things to directly hurt or threaten another person is when the victim is created.  If I buy a switchblade on Amazon, then a month later, I use it to rob someone on the street, that is the point at which I created a victim, not the point of sale that happened a month earlier.

Civil asset forfeiture isn't criminal.  You're thinking of criminal asset forfeiture.  Most people don't understand the difference, but it's fucking *huge*.
Legal marijuana growers and porn actresses are also legal.
In fact, the *only* thing that could potentially be considered illegal that I mentioned was the Backpage ads.  However, Backpage itself is totally legal.  If it were illegal, the government would have just shut it down.  But ads for escorts is technically legal.  So they attacked them by limiting their payment options.

Converting cash into bitcoin will help them evade the ludicrous taxes they're going to be hit with to help refund their empty coffers.
Right now, there's a withdraw tax on all greek bank accounts.  If you were paid in cash and converted to bitcoin (or just worked for bitcoin in the first place), you would essentially be exempt from that tax.  Additionally, it would be easier to evade all taxation in general.
Also, in my opinion, the next step is that Greece is going to decide to go back to Drachmas.  People are going to wake up one morning and find their accounts have been converted from Euro to Drachma, and the Drachma buys half as much as the Euro did the day before.  They'll obviously print Drachma out their ass so that they can keep paying their workers/retirees at the state conversation rate (which will be a joke compared to the real rate once those markets start up).

This just shows that you offer a cheaper price than a competitor.  I'm asking about how your customers have any potential to profit at all.
I assume you aim to make money, right?  So I assume that using your hardware, you want to make as much money as possible.  If mining was the most profitable option, I assume you'd be doing that.  But if you find that it's *more* profitable to sell your mining power to others, that means that the power you're selling is worth less than the bitcoin it has the potential to mine.  Again, if it wasn't, you'd just be mining yourself and profiting even more.

Tx malleability fix, instant txs on a second payment layer, quadratic scaling of sighash operations problem is actually solved (instead of just a bandaid like bcash), discrete log contracts, increased security of P2SH (256 bit instead of 160 bit, which can potentially be broken), economic incentives to reduce the UTXO set.  Plus we're working on MAST and sighash_noinput (which allows trustless 2-way pegged sidechains).  Plus countless bug fixes and verification improvements that went into the last 4 or 5 versions of bitcoin which bcash isn't capable of merging since their code base differs so much.
The reality is that there is absolutely no innovation on bcash.  They just keep hard forking the blocksize because it's the only change they're capable of making.  Meanwhile, the bcash average blocksize is like 70kb.  It's a dead blockchain with no usage, and no developers.


We actually solved that problem with segwit.  We have true linear scaling of sighash operations.  Bcash does not.


Satoshi's original DAA is a feature, not a bug. It's there intentionally, because the chain with less hashes *should* die off.  Bcash had to change Satoshi's DAA because their chain would be dead without it.  It actually never would have even existed, because the original miners that forked would have taken months or even years to find even the first block.


We have reliable confirmations.  Pay an appropriate fee based on current market conditions.  There's always a way to get your tx included in the next block.  Fees will vary based on supply and demand.  It's call market pricing, not subsidized cheap fees forever, like this is Venezuela or something.


The exact opposite is true.  Bitcoin has had multiple onchain efficiencies in verification times.  These changes were not merged into bcash.  So it's bcash that is not working on onchain processing efficiencies.  You have this one completely backwards.

Whether or not Soylent keeps btc, or converts it is irrelevant.  Would you care if they were based in Europe and where converting your US dollars to Euro?  No, you wouldn't care at all.

I wasn't asking about mining, I was asking about purchasing hashing power via mining contracts.
Assuming the goal is profit, why would a company sell their hashing power if mining bitcoin was more profitable?  Answer; they wouldn't.  They are doing the most profitable thing they can do with their hashing power; mining.  The only reason to sell your hashing power would be if it's more profitable to sell it than to mine bitcoin with it.  That means that the hashing power one would purchase must be worth less than the bitcoin they are going to mine using said hashing power.
In other words, it's a scam.  Now, I'm not saying you won't profit, I'm simply saying that the best case scenario is that you profit slightly less than you would have if you would have just invested or held onto that same amount of bitcoin in the first place.

Actually it's much faster than a credit card.  When you swipe a credit card, the transaction doesn't get verified for days.  Additionally, the merchant doesn't get the funds for days.  Merchant know this and take that risk.
With bitcoin, the transaction is verified in minutes, not days.  Additionally, the merchant gets access to the funds in minutes, not days.  The merchant can take the risk of accepting payment as soon as it's initiated, just like they take that risk with credit card users.  The merchant does not have to wait for verification.  Additionally, a single confirmation can take just seconds and gives a lot of confidence in the transaction.

No, I can't confirm.  Evidence is just evidence.  Proof is subjective.  The more evidence, the more people will see it as "proof".
While we both can't necessarily prove our opinions, I do believe they *are* double spending.  The evidence is pretty substantial in my opinion.  However, I actually think this is good for the bitcoin network.  This will help developers figure out ways to overcome future problems like this.  This will also potentially stop people from accepting 0-confirmation transactions.
However, I do recommend that people move away from mining at GHash.  Move to [Slush's pool](  It's great with fast, consistent payouts, and it's much smaller.

A user can have the funds and simply dispute the charge after the fact.  The merchant will receive no payment.  This is a risk merchants take.
This is rare, but not as rare as double spend attempts.  As a merchant accepting hundreds or thousands of transactions a day, the occasional double spend attack would be more rare than the chargebacks that occur today.
Additionally, as I said, waiting for a single confirmation would drastically reduce the chances of a double spend.  There is really no reason for a merchant to wait for a full verification.

You're more likely to get robbed when you blindly hand your money over to a third party that you've never met.  This had nothing to do with bitcoin or banking.


You have missed the entire purpose of bitcoin.  I don't want to bury my money.  I want an easy to use system just like debit cards and bank accounts.  It's just that I want full control and I don't like the terms banks offer.  I don't want to deal with frozen accounts, bank runs, weird hours, or 100 page terms of service documents.

Car industry, airline industry, wireless network industry, medical insurance industry, banking.
5 of the heaviest regulated industries in the country right now.
3 car manufacturers provide the vast majority of production.  There are like 5 national airlines left.  About 3 national wireless carriers.  States have been reduced to just one or two insurance providers.  The vast majority of banking in the US is all controlled by 5 banks.
This is all by design.  Regulation destroys competition and creates oligopolies and monopolies.
Now look at an industry that is relatively non-regulated.  Clothing manufacturing or something boring like that.  There is a near infinite number of suppliers, manufacturers, competitors, distributors, retailers, etc.
Free markets breed massive competition and low prices.  Regulation breeds cronyism, monopolies, and high prices.

You still keep dancing around the very first question I asked you.  What is your point?  You've left me making assumptions because you haven't answered that question.
I can sum up my point easily.
A fractional reserve banking system with fiat dollars only works when the vast majority of users do not withdraw their money.  It's a top-heavy balancing act which can collapse at any point in time if there are too many withdraws.
Bitcoin doesn't have this problem because you control your own money.  There is no bank.
You then brought up Mt Gox.  I'm not sure why because you never explained your point.
Sites like Bitstamp or Circle are fine to use as exchanges.  You exchange your fiat to bitcoin or vice versa and you withdraw.  No problem there.  What I said is that it's stupid to let these sites *hold* your money.  I would call anyone an idiot if they let bitstamp hold their money for them.
If you don't solely control your private keys, you are leaving yourself open to theft.  This is the equivalent of trusting a random person with holding your cash for you.  Sure they might be reputable today, but why take that risk?  As I pointed out, it's neither required nor recommended for daily use.

Bitcoin is the name of both a currency and a payment processing network.  In fact, I'd argue that it's the payment processing attributes (p2p, decentralized, distributed, non-government, non-corporate) that gives bitcoin the currency it's value.
The only reason that the individual bitcoin units are worth anything is that they are the only units that can be traded on the Bitcoin payment processing network.

But if bitcoin is just property, like a frisbee, then how is he a money transmitter?  He's just effectively converting fiat into frisbees.  That's it.  A used frisbee shop that buys and sells frisbees wouldn't be considered a money transmitter.  So what's the difference?

So you're saying an attacker would just send about 65,000 transactions every ten minutes filling up all 20MB of each block? (20mb/[322bytes](
So then why isn't he doing this now, when it's much cheaper to fill up 1mb blocks?
Your fear again doesn't make any sense.  Today, an attacker could theoretically spam the bitcoin network with DoS inspired transactions.  He'd need to send about 3,300 transactions every ten minutes, filling up a 1mb block.  This would be much cheaper and much easier to pull off than waiting for 20mb blocks, where he'd need to send 20x the transactions to pull off the same attack.
So again, why does this fear of yours only rear it's head when 20mb blocks are involved?  The attacker has a financial incentive to want to launch his attack with only 1mb blocks, as opposed to 20mb blocks.  It would cost him significantly more money to get to the same end (which still isn't clear anyway) if we had 20mb blocks.

No it doesn't.  First of all, no one is arguing for 20mb blocks. We're taking about increasing the upper limit to 20mb to accommodate more traffic.  This would take years before blocks started approaching that size. 
As was pointed out, if there were even 1 million bitcoin users (a small number of people in this world), the current 1mb limit would accommodate just a single transaction per person, per week.

I am not against paying for better service.  I think different levels of service should be available for purchase.
That's like saying we need "car neutrality" where every car has to have the same horsepower and go the same maximum speed.  That would be stupid and I wouldn't support a law like that either.
My other concern is what you want and what the government passes into law are two different beasts.  If there's one thing I know about politicians, it's that they lie.  Think about the name "The Patriot Act" vs what it actually allows.  The name is essentially the exact opposite of what the real intent of the bill is.
The bottom line is that I don't trust the government, and I don't support *any* new laws unless they simply repeal existing laws.

I said they have a monopoly on the "legitimate" use of force, not all force.  Anyone can use force or be violent.  I am not saying that the government's use of force is legitimate in my eyes, I'm simply saying that in the law's eyes (and society), the government's use of force is legally allowed.
In my eyes, force is only legitimate in defense.  The government has declared their use of force legitimate in all uses, including the initiation of force, which I'm opposed to.
In the geographical area where a government claims ownership of, anyone who initiates force besides the government itself is deemed illegitimate.  I have issue with this monopoly.  I have issue with this exception.

False.  The block size *limit* is 20MB and 1MB respectively.  That doesn't mean every single block is that size.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:53:39
All I know is that this issue is hotly debated, and no one is going to implement anything without each criticism being fully vetted.  Has a thread on bitcointalk.org been started about this potential issue?
I highly doubt this will be implemented if a double-spend attack will be this straight forward.  I have more faith in the developers.  We've done forks before.  We've even rolled back after a bug was found.  Everyone here wants bitcoin to succeed, and something like you've described would be extremely bad.  I don't think it'll be allowed to happen.
I think an increase to the block size is absolutely necessary for bitcoin to succeed.  Transaction times can't be arbitrarily limited, and as we grow, we're going to need a bigger block to handle normal daily transaction volume.  What do you propose we do to address this?
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:14:10
This isn't semantics.  People like you legitimately try to make the argument that every block will be 20MB.  This is completely insane.
The limit has been 1MB for years.  Show me all the 1MB blocks please.  They're extremely rare.
Also, you can't control how big a block is.  You can potentially control the size of a single transaction, but not 100%.  What you're worried about isn't really an issue.

Yes, absolutely.  In fact, billions of dollars are spent every single year on privatized forms of protection.  Why is that crazy?  From bodyguards, to private investigators, to armored car companies, to security guards at stores, to home alarm systems.  These are all forms of private protection and defense.  I'll ask you a question.  Where would you feel safer; in the middle of Disney World patrolled by private security guards, or in Detroit patrolled by government police?  I know I'd feel a lot safer at Disney.  I have a feeling you're from the UK, so replace Detroit with some equally bad area notorious for crime.


First of all, I don't speak for anyone but myself.  There's no "you guys" here.  Second of all, resorting to personal attacks means you don't actually have an argument.  Have you ever read any serious work on the subject of private defense agencies?  If not, then who are you to say what is "fucking mental" or not?  You have likely just grown up with the standard force-fed indoctrination of how government is so grand, all brought to you by the government.  Now, as an adult, you're just regurgitating everything you were indoctrinated with.  That's not impressive.  Additionally, just because we disagree doesn't mean either of us are "fucking mental".

1. Agreed.  But it doesn't have consensus.

Yes, but it's irrelevant in this context.  Whether there's room for improvement or not, miners have always been the metric used for signaling support for forks.


You're assuming that once a hardfork happens, and it's split at least 75/25, that the 25 will remain with the losing fork.  They will have an economic incentive to admit defeat, and join the majority fork.  So yes, it could very quickly lead day-long blocks.

Well we agree then.  At least you've come around.  My point this entire time has been that this is arbitrary central planning.
The thing is that the fixed supply, block time, and halving intervals where known to all parties in advance.  These were always meant to be constants.

OPEC doesn't own or produce oil.  It's a state operated organization that regulates the oil market.

Developers don't produce blocks, yet they produce the code that determines the properties of blocks.
Miners actually produce blocks.  However, if miners decide to increase the blocksize without the developers' permission, the developers scream foul.


There is, and that's an objective fact.  1mb isn't a naturally occurring limit.  It's an artificial limit that was created by a human (or humans).

Unfortunately, I think segwit as implemented is unable to achieve consensus.
As a compromise, why doesn't core modify segwit so that witness data is discounted even further? Instead of only counting 1/4 of witness data towards the 1mb blocksize, who not 1/5th or 1/6th?  This will preserve the softfork, keep segwit as is (in other regards), but at least show good faith in compromising.
I honestly think that miners will be more willing to adopt segwit if the developers simply acknowledged the divide in the community and made an effort to compromise.

Well, there's nothing fake about [PriceWaterhouseCooper's funding of Blockstream](  There's also nothing fake about Blockstream paying a majority of well known core developers (Back, Sipr, Maxwell, Luke-Jr, Russel, Timon, Friedenbach and many more).  The only thing that's being speculated is ultimately their motivation.  What I'm saying is that regardless of their motivation, there is a clear conflict of interest.  PWC wants profit.  Blockstream's revenue model is to sell side-chain access.  They would profit more if on-chain throughput is small.  Even if they claim this isn't what motivates them to keep the throughput low, there is a clear conflict of interest concern.


News flash; miners already control the blockchain.  Miners are the only entities that can modify the blockchain.  We've known this since day one.  This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

That's not true.  It just gives you SPV level security until you upgrade.  The segwit softfork does the exact same thing.

You're just making a ridiculous statement that double spend attacks will be possible.  You have no proof of this.  I don't believe you, and when my searches for you concern prove fruitless, that leads me to believe 1 of 2 things.  1) You have knowledge that no one else knows about, including the developers, or;  2) Your theory is wrong.
If option 1 is true, then why not bring this concern up to the developers, and allow them to discuss it?
It's clear to me that option 2 logically makes more sense.  You don't really know what you're talking about.
 


It doesn't take a genius to see this.  [We're approaching the current 1MB size limit fast](
  If bitcoin can't handle the daily volume of transactions, people will abandon it for alternatives.  This limit is arbitrary, and Satoishi himself discussed that it was only put in initially to avoid spam in the early days of low legitimate volume.




I agree.  I'd rather remove the cap completely, or implement a cap that changes, like difficulty, based on certain conditions.


I'm all for innovation, but I want to see bitcoin succeed, not something else.  I want the bitcoin developers to continue to innovate and solve problems, not just say, "let someone else do it", which is what you propose.
@_date: 2017-02-11 22:19:33
Perhaps I'm missing something, but I though that CLTV and CSV do not rely on "anyone can spend"..  If I'm wrong, do you mind explain how old nodes see these transactions as "anyone can spend"?
With segwit, the signature data is literally moved to another location, which old nodes can't see.  In CLTV and CSV, the scriptsig is still visible to old nodes.  So how could anyone spend those?
@_date: 2017-02-03 14:23:31


Yes.  Are you new to the concept of blockchain forks?  That's currently how all signaling works, for both soft and hard forks.


Both segwit and BU have around 23% each.  Segwit needs 95% which is impossible if BU holds anything more than 5%.  BU only needs 75% which is possible today, even if segwit holds their current hash power.
Mathematically, only BU is possible right now.


Let's see how much the Core chain is worth when &gt;75% of the mining power leaves, and it take days to find a new block.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:20:23

That's not a logical solution.  If your money is being taken against your will, you shouldn't have to uproot your family and move across the planet to avoid the theft.  Additionally, there have been some notable billionaires who have tried this, and the government continues to go after them for taxes, regardless.  There have also been attempts by the government to write laws to go after expats for more tax money.
Additionally, if I started robbing you routinely, then said to you "all you have to do is move to another country and I'll stop", you would not think that was a fair deal.  You would say that's absurd. And you'd be right.  It is absurd to suggest that.
Edit: Another caveat to your suggestion is that wherever you move to, there will be a new group of thugs who will start stealing your money.
Again, compare all this to a corporation.  If you don't like a corporation, stop giving them your money and presto! They don't get any more of your money! It's an instant solution and you don't have to spend thousands of dollars moving across the globe.

My comment has no ideology, just objective facts. 


There is not an engineering constraint around 1mb. Blocks could be 2mb and there would be absolutely no engineering constraint that would threaten decentralization as we know it. Hell, segwit gives us something like 3.7mb theoretically, and everyone agrees that would be safe. So why is there an "engineering limit" with anything more than 1mb? Hint; there isn't. 


I support segwit you fool. I'm very clear on that. I'm not a "BU booster".  I would honestly like to see 17.7% yearly blocksize increase proposal in addition to segwit.

You're missing the reason why BU exists in the first place.  You're attacking them for having the audacity to defy core and offer semi-popular alternative solutions to the problems bitcoin faces today.
The Core development team has a growing public relations problem.  They're seen as having been taken over by a corporation (Blockstream) being completely funded by billionaire globalist/statist organizations like PWC.  The theory is that they want as little on-chain growth as possible, so that they can sell their side-chain product to banks/corporations.
Whether any of this is true is irrelevant.  This is what a growing number of people see.
Segwit means "push transactions off chain" to many people.  BU hears the concerns of users and miners, and have decided to implement alternative solutions that scale bitcoin on-chain.
This debate ultimately comes down to what you think bitcoin is.  Is it a crypto-currency, or a crypto-settlement layer?
I'd personally like to see Segwit (without witness discounts) coupled with a long term blocksize growth strategy (something like BIP101, but less aggressive).


I agree.  The "majority" is comprised of everyone; miners, nodes, merchants, exchanges, users, wallets, etc.. It's hard to specifically define, but it'll be easy to figure out if an actual choice emerges.  No one will logically remain with the losing side.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:40:33

I think you might be getting confused with Luke-Jr's claim that the Sun revolves around the Earth.


Agreed!  Thankfully bitcoin is not democratic.  Every user and every miner gets to select which implementation they want to use, and which set of consensus rules they adhere to.  If the network splits, it splits, and users/miners still get to decide to use whatever implementation they want.  But remember, there is an economic incentive to staying in consensus with the majority of others.

Send money to someone in another country without using third parties.  Seriously, go try.  You can't.  That had never been possible until bitcoin.  This isn't a benefit?  Talk to the millions of people who struggle with this (or get ripped off) every single day.
Merchants who accept bitcoin (even sell it at the point of sale) avoid all credit card processing fees.  This isn't a benefit?  3% is massive to a company.  We're talking billions of dollars a year globally that can be saved.  But billions?  Nah, that's not a benefit..  Good point.

Not sure a tumbler would work.  Too centralized.  Some analysis can be done to track it all, even if you can find a tumbler which enough reserves to properly hide $500k of bitcoin.
However, if you get the transactions off-chain (convert arbitrary amounts to litecoin, dogecoin, namecoit, etc) then convert them back in different arbitrary amounts, it would be close to impossible to track..
You'd probably have to write some code to automate it slowly over months, using lots of different crypto-exchange APIs, utilizing as many different alt-coins as possible, and ending up with lots of new bitcoin addresses all in various amounts.

I'm asking how.  You just keep stating that they can.
I showed an example of a p2sh script above.  How would someone satisfy that spending requirement?  To spend the output, you would need to provide an input that when hashed, equals the hash in the script.
How could "anyone" do that?  Hashing can't be performed backwards.  The only way I could see this happening is if the p2sh tx output was spent by the rightful recipient, then the softfork was rolled back.  In that case the actual script would be visible, so anyone could spend it.
But if it was not spent by the rightful owner, I still fail to see how anyone could provide input unlocks that output.
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:52:27
I think you're misunderstanding the criticism.  Everyone understands what you've pointed out.
What people say is that if for some reason we had to roll back because of a bug (like has happened in the past), any segwit transaction output will be spendable by anyone.
So it creates a point of no return so to speak..  The likelihood of any of this happening is obviously extremely low.. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:19:42
But as a compromise, you can implement two separate fully vetted options.
For instance, I'd like to see both Segwit, and [Pieter Wuille's blocksize proposal](
Both are good proposals and bitcoin will benefit from both of them.  I also think the miners will see this as a good faith effort at healing this divided community.  I believe it would have a better chance at gaining consensus.
@_date: 2017-02-11 22:22:51


I don't understand the logic of this sentence.
Do you mind expanding a bit?  Can you give me an example of what the locking and unlocking scripts would look like to an old node?  How could "anyone" trick an old node?
With segwit, the unlock script is literally not visible to old nodes.  In all other soft forks, it is.

But merchants accept credit card transactions instantly.  Merchants today do not accept bitcoin transactions instantly, and won't.  They wait for verification.
If you guys stall on this, and transaction times end up being hours long, because there are simply too many transaction to fit into a single 1MB block,  double spend attacks will be simple against any merchant who accepts an unconfirmed transaction.

Again though, you don't understand the difference between bitcoin and websites.  Don't store your bitcoin on a website.  If you do, it can be hacked.  Also, the 2nd hack you're referring to had no effect on customers.  They acknowledged they got hacked, and they made sure none of their client's money was taken.  They took the hit themselves.


What in the world are you talking about?


Not even close.  You clearly don't understand what a ponzi scheme is either.  Ponzi schemes involves the promise of returns to investors.  The perpetrator turns around and gives out new investors' contributions to previous investors, giving the illusion of a return.  Bitcoin has absolutely none of these properties whatsoever; none.  Once again, your ignorance shines bright.
Can I just ask what your goal is here?  Why do you hate bitcoin so much?  If you don't like it, don't use it.  It's simple.  But why do you go out of your way to fight about it?  What is there to gain?  How does that improve your life?

If segwit had ~85% and BU had the other 15%, then yes, you could make the argument that BU is blocking segwit adoption.  But the numbers aren't even close.

Segwit unfortunately is dead in its current form.  It needs 95% miner consensus to activate, and there's ~24% supporting BU.  These numbers can't work.

Here's my ultimate question.  Why 1MB?  I understand that 20MB is arbitrary, and doesn't really do anything but kick the can, but at the same time, why 1MB?
Keeping the blocksize at 1MB is certain to accomplish one thing.  Cause mass confusion.  New users will be confused as to why their transactions are unverified.  This will halt growth.  Who the hell wants to use a system where transaction times are hours long and sometimes never get confirmed?
Keeping the size set to this arbitrarily low value will be the official dethroning of bitcoin.

After segwit, it'll be "we'll see what happens after Lightning".  Blockstream's business model depends on full blocks, because they're providing alternative off-chain or side-chain solutions.  They don't want to ever increase the blocksize, and pretending they will is ignorant.

First of all, looking at the results of those votes, it's pretty clear there was a lot of trolling.

I believe the voting was just to see where the community sits on these issues.  I mispoke if I said they make every change that was voted on.

You're missing the point.. I'm not talking about upgrading your node to the latest version. I'm talking about wallet software (SPV clients) actually implementing SegWit transactions.
The hard fork version of SegWit would not understand transactions which contain a signature in the standard way (the way all wallet software complies with today).  Literally every single wallet would have to modify the way it generates transactions or the network wouldn't understand what they were broadcasting.. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:56:15


Agreed.  But it would relieve the congestion we're seeing now, which is a good thing.  Additionally, I think this hard fork is more about governance than blocksize.  We're tired being held hostage by the will of a corporation.  Blockstream has proven that any organization (potentially including a government) can hijack the development process.  I want the governance model to change, so we have less reliance on a particular team of developers.
@_date: 2016-03-17 00:22:44


Lol.  This fixes the problem that cause that accidental fork.  The reason there was a fork was because of the hack miners are using today to do validationless mining.  This *isn't* validationless.

First off, bitcoin isn't the US reserve currency.  Deflation with something like gold or bitcoin doesn't have any effect of the economy the way the US dollar does. 
Second, the Fed and government have created a scenario where they cannot grow without a constant stream of new debt. Inflation is required so that the existing federal debt is worth less and easier to repay.  If they stopped inflating the money supply or stopped the never-ending infusion of new debt, the entire US economy would collapse, possibly the world economy.

Of course I've read the roadmap.  I believe the talk about future blocksize increases is nothing but lip service.  They've always maintained the illusion of "we'll do it later".  First it was "let's wait until after the conference in Canada", then it was, "let's wait until after the scaling conference in Hong Kong", now it's, "let's wait until after segwit is released".  It's nothing but lip service.  This is an active rejection of a blocksize increase.  Segwit should be rolled out *with* a blocksize increase, especially since it essentially turns all un-upgraded nodes to SPV clients that can't confirm transactions anyway.
Additionally, that "effective" 4mb throughput that segwit supposedly gives us is extremely disingenuous.   It's purely theoretical, and to achieve that, a block would have to be completely filled with only 15-of-15 multisig segwit transactions.  That will absolutely never happen.  Based on real analysis, segwit will give us an effective throughput in the neighborhood of 1.375mb to 1.75mb max.  Additionally, there's no telling *when* this increased effective throughput will be seen.  Upgrading nodes to accept segwit transactions doesn't do anything.  It relies *entirely* on wallet software to actually change the structure of transactions to meet the new segwit standard.  Most people don't realize this.  This could take additional months to years to fully roll out.  They completely avoid talking about this.
This is why I believe that roadmap is extremely disingenuous.  They pretend that segwit will immediately increase throughput, which it won't, and they pretend that it'll be an effective 4mb blocksize increase, which it won't.  They additionally pretend that an actual hardforked blocksize increase is on the table (at some magical future date), when it won't.  I believe they will *never* compromise, short of a successful hardfork from Bitcoin Classic or another new competing client.
In the end, they should have been more honest and more upfront about the reality of what segwit brings us.

In theory. But not in reality. Segwit only discounts witness data, but a tx contains non witness data, so that theoretical maximum is not realistic at all.  Based on the market's tx use, segwit alone will give us 2.1mb blocks only once everyone uses segwit addresses. It will take a while for that to happen. 


I just want segwit asap, and I'm willing to compromise for it. Again, how else do you see segwit activating? No one ever answers this question.

@_date: 2017-03-16 13:55:48
What I don't understand with the BU side is why are they not *also* supporting segwit?
Even if segwit doesn't give them enough of a tx throughput increase, why not take a little and relieve some congestion plus lower fees?
They can still continue to attempt to gain support for their fork.  These are not mutually exclusive.
But guys like Jihan Wu and Roger Ver are actively stopping segwit.  Their hash power combined (plus all the pools that look to Jihan for advice/instruction), they could get segwit close to 75% (95% needed for bip9 activation).  If we're that close, other miners will come forward to push it over the edge.
By all means, they can continue to try to get support for BU, during the whole process.  But at least we'll have a throughput increase, plus fee reductions.
What the hell guys?

Keep pumping out good builds.  These performance increases will help convince miners to upgrade to segwit compatible builds.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:42:08
I don't think you understand how consensus algorithms work.
If a "Bitcoin 42m" project pops up, which doubles the total eventual supply to 42 million, and they convince the majority of the network to switch (something that I believe will never happen, since it's not in anyone interest to reduce their stake in bitcoin), then the longest chain will support this feature.
You'd still be free to mine on the 21m supply chain, just as you're free to mine on bitcoin core vs bitcoin classic when it becomes available.  However, if support is overwhelmingly popular, the smaller side of the fork is going to become worthless and irrelevant very quickly.
Nothing I've said is controversial.  This is *how* bitcoin was designed.  But like I said, I don't support raising the total supply, and neither does anyone in the community.  I highly doubt anyone would support this, since it would not be in their best interest.
*edit: clarification*
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:07:27
Great read. I disagree with your 3 priorities, but agree with everything you said about governance,and blocksize increase. 
Additionally, I don't think outputs should be allowed to change in RBF, just the fee.  It's almost like they're incentivizing fraud by allowing the outputs to be changed as well.  I have a feeling that the RBF they're creating is a requirement for a future Blockstream project, and that's why they're pushing so hard despite widespread concern and no clear consensus, even among devs.
Regarding the blocksize, it's clear what the community wants, and where the economic consensus weighs in. Core is alienating themselves and I'm nervous and curious as to why.  Plenty of opportunity has been made to compromise, no blocksize limit, back to the original 32mb, to 20mb, to 8mb, to 2-4-8, and finally to 2mb.. Absolutely everything has been rejected with no clear reasons besides, "hard forks are bad, m'kay?" even the softfork implementation of the 2mb increase was rejected. It's simply frustrating. 
I too have massive respect for the developers and the work they've done, but it's time to compromise. When SegWit is finally introduced (an idea I love), they need to include a 2mb increase as well (to take place at a later date). It's the only way they can reel support of the community back.. 
Good luck to all and thanks again to both you, and the developers.

Not true.  Your scenario is extremely narrow minded.  If x% of all bitcoin users run nodes, and the amount of bitcoin users increases, this increases the total number of nodes out there.  If you can't run a node that can upload 2mb blocks every ten minutes, then get a better internet connection.  You're probably not even helping the network with such a slow connection with 1mb blocks to begin with.
By keeping blocks artificially limited to 1mb, we're limiting growth.  I'm seeing complaints of 5-10 hours of unconfirmed transactions even *with* fees.  There's a 9mb backlog right now and every block is full.  This is unhealthy.  I want the network to handle more users which gets us more nodes, which decreases centralization.

Looking at this from the "Blockstream conspiracy" angle, it's not really ironic..
To be profitable, Blockstream needs bitcoin to be secure.  No one questions Blockstream's motives here.  Everyone trusts them to ensure it's secure.
However, some people think that Blockstream wants to create artificial scarcity and prematurely force a high fee market, so that users are driven away from making native bitcoin transactions, and onto Blockstream's side chain products.
So again, it's not really ironic.  Everyone wants bitcoin to be secure.  But we just disagree about the number of transactions that should be allowed to take place on the blockchain.

It is hard to measure, but when all the exchanges say they want replay and reorg protection, that's a good place to start. You need exchanges on board. Miners won't attempt a split without them. 
Seconds is wallet developers. Most people don't run nodes, they use spv wallets. When the majority of all wallets won't support this new asset, what wallet will users use? 
The vast majority of users aren't going to switch wallets. Again, miners won't attempt a split without support in this area.

Based on what?  I'm not convinced the core team is ever willing to do this.  They were teasing the idea of a compromise for months; after the conference in Canada, after the conference in Hong Kong, after segwit, after lightning, etc.. They want 1mb blocks so that an artificial, centrally planned fee market is created which will push transactions onto their products (Elements, Lightning, etc), which will help them profit instead of help bitcoin grow.

I just have two questions.  Do you have any criticisms against head-first mining?  Do you believe this will get merged into Core?
I believe that Adam will not like this because it takes away one of his criticisms of larger blocks.  He needs those criticisms to stay alive to ensure that he can continue to artificially strangle transaction volume.

I hear you and I completely agree.  I've supported segwit from the beginning.


I believe that not only would segwit have been activated by now, but a separate scaling proposal would have also be activated as well.
Essentially, if core had done what they said they were going to do in the HK agreement, everything would have been activated; segwit + hard fork blocksize increase.
I know that agreement fell apart pretty damn fast; dirty tactics on both sides.

An insignifcant minority.  95% of mining power signaled support for it extremely quickly.  There was no organized dissent at all.  One or two loud voices is fine.  There wasn't a community built around the opposition of any of these features.

This still reduces the scaling side-effect that segwit was promised to bring us.
So far I've seen it go from "essentially 4mb blocks" to "2mb blocks" to "2mb blocks assuming everyone starts using segwit multisig" to "1.7mb as long as everyone switches to segwit" to "1.3mb assuming half of everyone switches to segwit" to "1.3mb minus the size of the hash of the coinbase witness data"..
This is why I always said we shouldn't be arguing for segwit from a scaling point of view.  Segwit has *lots* of great benefits.  Argue those and leave scaling out of it.  Scaling should be a separate issue.

But how can they, without replay protection?  Do you understand what that implies?  If bitcoin is sent on the core chain, that tx can be replayed on the BU chain and vice versa.  Exchanges could potentially be on the hook for millions of dollars.  They won't put themselves at that risk without protections in place.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:15:16
Nothing in that link disputes anything I said.  I'm talking about overwhelming consensus here.
No one wants an increased total supply.  If a couple pool operators decide to collude and support a feature like that (giving themselves &gt;50%), they wouldn't succeed.  The price of the coins mined on the 42m chain would plummet, and coins on the 21m chain would increase in price.  Additionally, individual miners would migrate away from the 42m pools toward pools that stay with the traditional 21m supply limit.
All I'm saying is that if an overwhelming majority of the bitcoin community supported an increase to a 42m total supply limit, that would be the new supply limit.

You're thinking in the wrong direction. BU could modify their code so that BU miners would mine on the segwit chain, and finding a block there satisfies the condition for the BU chain as well. This is exactly what Namecoin has implemented.  Then they just make blocks empty on the segwit chain.

We do not want a chain split without majority hashing power. The segwit/core chain would be destroyed.

@_date: 2017-03-01 13:54:27
Well then I guess I'm referring to the traditional definition of consensus; An opinion or position reached by a group as a whole.
Segwit doesn't have near-universal support like the CSV, CLTV, and p2sh softforks had.  The majority of hashpower doesn't currently support it, a large minority of nodes don't support it, and a large number of bitcoin users don't support it.
The failure of segwit to gain consensus among the bitcoin community is not a technical failure, but a marketing failure.  Again, I look forward to it activating, but I think there needs to be some additional on-chain scaling proposal from core before the community will rally together; that's just my opinion.

They have lots of great features in that plan, all of which I support (really looking forward to segwit).  However, they missed an important part.  We need at least a small bump in the max blocksize to relieve the massive congestion we're currently seeing.  It could be months or years after segwit is released before we see the scaling benefits it is capable of.  Remember, it all comes down to wallet software actually *creating* segwit transactions.  Every node in the world can accept segwit, and it doesn't do a thing until the users actually create segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:01:04


Regardless of whether it happens before or after a BU hardfork, an chain split from a pow change is likely.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:44:04
If BU gets &gt;50%, and the chain does split, both chains will be competing for resources and value.  They will both suffer if the chain remains semi-equally split.  One needs to emerge as the clear dominant chain.  At that point, they would be *incentivized* to kill off the minority segwit/core chain, to persuade miners to switch over to the BU/longer chain.
This is what worries me, they *will* have an economic incentive to do this attack.

I don't have anything backwards.  This has been my point all along.  BU can implement merged mining to shut down the minority (segwit) chain by mining empty blocks, ensuring everyone switches over to the BU chain (where blocks won't be empty).  Merchants won't accept the segwit chain if txs don't ever appear in the blockchain.


If segwit attempted a UASF without a majority hash power, and the majority rallied around BU, BU can ensure that the segwit chain sees nothing but empty blocks.  The absolutely only way the segwit chain can survive is by changing the hashing algorithm.  At that point, it would lose the one thing it has over every other altcoin; security.  Starting from scratch with a new mining algorithm is nothing but starting an altcoin.  You will have no security, and attacks would have a very low cost.

Core hasn't given miners the option to even attempt to reach consensus on a blocksize increase, so how can you say it cannot be achieved?

Did you even read the responses to that proposal on the Bitcoin mailing list?  Some core devs have pointed out many problems with it.
If UASF activates with a minority of the mining power, a single miner can force a hardfork, then used merged mining to ensure the minority fork only gets empty blocks moving forward. 
This isn't a solution.

Your opinion is insane.   As long as you're willing to pay the right fees to get your txs included in blocks, you are using bitcoin as intended. You can't tell someone their tx is less important than yours.

They had economic consensus in addition to mining consensus.  All major players, from developers, to exchanges, to wallets, backed the fork.
That is the big difference.  In BU, they convinced about 5 chinese mining pool operators.  That's the extent of BU's economic "consensus".

Once segwit is implemented, won't regular non-segwit transactions still be valid?  Which means that this doesn't fix tx malleability, and it doesn't increase scale at all, at least not right away.  It could take years before segwit is actually adopted by the community, if at all..
I think the hardfork version of segwit should have been prioritized, making non-segwit transactions invalid.  This would have immediately fixed tx malleability and also immediately helped with scaling.  A small block size increase could have also been included if the hard fork method was chosen.  It also would be much cleaner code.

If there is a segwit transaction that looks like "anyone can spend" to the non segwit chain, a malicious miner can spend that output to himself. The non segwit nodes and miners will see that as valid. The segwit nodes and miners will know that it is invalid. 
This will split the chain.  If the segwit side is longer, then no big deal. The bad block is  orphaned since the non segwit miners will mine the longest valid chain. If the non segwit chain is longer, a split will occur.
Now I believe that a split will be resolved quickly, and everyone will move to the segwit side, but we don't know exactly how it would play out.

Bitcoin was the first implementation of the concept.  There was no such thing as decentralized crypto-currenices before bitcoin was created.  So I don't understand this argument.  Would you rather use dogecoin or litecoin?  Is that what you're saying?


Volatility is a thing, yes.  The more widespread it becomes, the less volatile it'll be.  If you compare volatility from 3 years ago to today, you'd see that it's much, much less volatile.  It would make sense that in a few years, volatility will be even smaller


I don't think you know what "implementation" means, because you're using it all wrong.  Bitcoin is traded on multiple free market exchanges.  There will always be fluctuations in price with anything that is freely traded.  Nothing in the implementation can change this besides a peg, which doesn't make sense.


Again, you keep trying to make collectivist arguments.  You're pretending bitcoin is a centrally controlled reserve currency.  I'm not interested is your theory on what will happen to the economy, or when anyone else retires.


I have never mentioned this, yet you keep bringing it up as if I said it.  It would behoove you to actually read what I'm writing instead of making incorrect assumptions.  You sound foolish.

First of all, I completely agree. I look forward to a multi layered bitcoin protocol. 
But to play devil's advocate, I think that layer one should be capable of handling more throughput than 1mb (or even 4mb with Segwit) every ten minutes.
But i still say that segwit should be implemented ASAP. We can debate about a larger non-witness blocksize after we see the improvements from segwit.

I'm honestly glad to see coming from Pieter.  Good on him.
However, Luke Jr. just continues to lose respect from me though..  He's words are spiteful and full of vengeance.  Additionally, I think he's out of touch with reality:


Who wants to fork *against* the consensus of the community?  No one is advocating that.  The community is rallying around a small 1mb max blocksize increase.  No one is going to fork without overwhelming consensus.  Forget pool operators, we're seeing merchants, exchanges, and regular users *all* supporting this tiny blocksize increase.  Luke, you're are the one "against the consensus of the community/economy".
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:15:19


In effect, it's the same thing. We're at a theoretical limit of about 7tx/s, in practice is around 4tx/s (since tx sizes vary). 


I have no problem with that. I simply don't want to be forced into that, and artificially high fees created by centrally planned scarcity forces me to use third party side chains (eventually). 


I never said ban anything. I've advocated for the lightning network. I've said it's necessary for long term growth.

Consumer protection can be added as a layer-2 feature to bitcoin.
If you transact with someone on a bitcoin marketplace like OpenBazaar, a third party will escrow payments in a multisig address.  This is a form of consumer protection.
But remember that bitcoin is only interesting because it's decentralized, and unregulated.  Bitcoin isn't just a corporate competitor to Paypal.  Bitcoin is revolutionary, because for the first time in human history, it enabled cross border, direct peer-2-peer payments, trustlessly, without needing the approval or facilitation of any third parties.
You can always add consumer protection on top of the bitcoin protocol, but once you cripple the protocol with built in government "protection" it can never be avoided.

The biggest criticism of blocksize increases is generally the hard fork.  It's considered too risky to force every user on the planet to upgrade or be forked into irrelevancy.

I'm not going to speculate on this, because I don't believe they'll have consensus to make this change.  This, just like the BU hardfork, would create a new coin.
I suspect they wouldn't attempt this, because if it further splits miners up, that will only hurt their resulting coin.

A compromise including segwit (with signature discounts) and a 2mb blocksize increase is perfectly safe. It would create an effective ~4.2 mb block over time. Your voodoo comparison makes no sense.
I want segwit asap, and i think a slight compromise is the best way to achieve it. Refusing to compromise means segwit won't activate. Where is the other 70% hash rate going to come from otherwise? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:35:47
Why not both?  Segwit is great and nesesary, but increasing tx throughput is only a side effect.  Additionally, when segwit is rolled out, there is no immidiate benefit or increase in throughput.  Wallet software has to actually create segwit transactions.  It could take years before the majority of wallets support this feature.

"Witness" data refers to the transaction signatures (proving you own the coins you're spending).  Right now the witness data is included in the transaction data structure.  One could say that our current transactions are "integrated witness" transactions.
Segregated witness means we separate the witness data into its own data structure.  This has a few benefits.  It fixes transactions malleability and it increases transaction volume (since witness data doesn't fully count against the max blocksize).
A downside would be that if you don't upgrade your node, you essentially become an SPV client, meaning you can't verify or confirm segwit transactions.  You should upgrade immediately.

@_date: 2017-03-24 22:06:06
I 100% back segwit and fear BU, but I can't get behind this.  A pow change is defeat in my opinion.  With a BU fork, we're in good shape because we are the default.  We are bitcoin.  We remain true to current consensus.  We have the economic majority on our side.
With a pow change, we're no longer "bitcoin".  We're no longer adhering to current consensus.  We're just creating an altcoin, same as BU.  The economic majority won't have a "stay put" option.  Bitcoin will be dead, and everyone will have to choose which resulting altcoin to join.  I believe at that point, big blocks is easier to swallow than a new pow scheme.
UASF is the solution to all of this.  Orphan non-segwit signaling blocks.  Force a chain split quick enough and the miners will quickly come to their senses.  It will resolve quickly.

The traditional definition of consensus is: An opinion or position reached by a group as a whole.
When we activated softforks like CSV, CLTV, and p2sh, we had both traditional consensus and consensus as defined in distributed computing.  With segwit, yes it adheres to distributed computing consensus, but it does not reach general consensus among the bitcoin community.

The Blockstream corporation is paying at least 4 of the most prominent bitcoin developers; Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, and Luke Jr (assumed, since you can see that he works on Blockstream projects on github).  Additionally they pay Jorge Timón, Matt Corallo, and Jonas Nick, who all work on bitcoin core, but are not as well known or vocal as the others.
Even if all of their intentions are pure, and you fully believe that there is no conflict of interest, isn't that a scary notion?  That a single entity can just easily pay developers, and potentially take control over the direction of the bitcoin consensus rules?
Satoshi said that the 1mb blocksize was temporary, and explained how to easily increase it.  I want his original vision.  I don't want Blockstream's altered vision, which coincidentally helps them profit by pushing their Elements side-chain product (which benefits from full blocks).

Immedietaly, developers at Blockstream refused to sign once they heard about it, calling Adam a "dipshit".  Adam backed off and said he only signed as an individual, not representing the company.  The miners were all very insulted by scam.
Regardless, if you actually read the agreement, the miners said they would only run core once the hard fork code was made available:


Why does everyone leave this part out?
The developers never released their version of the hard fork with the blocksize increase, as they promised.  The miners have nothing to uphold.  The condition was not met.
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:59:10


That's literally what's happening right now.


Your opinion.  My opinion is that bitcoin is the internet of money, not some corporation's separate products.
Another problem is that the two scenarios you're talking about (blockstream's "internet of money" and "come on guys 2mb blocks") aren't mutually exclusive.  They can coexist.  Blockstreams plans may be beneficial to us all in the future (maybe, maybe not), but we have a problem today.  Blocks are full.  There's a 10 block backlog.  It's taking hours for legitimate transactions to go through.  They are pushing an artificial fee market on us.  This is call "central planning".  This isn't decentralization.  This is a hostile takeover.
If they want to create side products and profit, good for them.  But don't hold bitcoin volume hostage to do that.  That's disingenuous.

I disagree.. A hardfork would make every single existing wallet and bitcoin service invalid.
Creating a transaction would change completely (signatures in a different data structure).  Absolutely no one has anything ready for this.  To do the hardfork of segwit would add at least another year on the timeline, just to give wallet developers time to actually implement the required changes.
Remember, once segwit happens, it'll likely take months before any significant segwit tx volume is actually seen..

Explain what you mean. Even if my wallet software knows what segwit is, my outputs are still locked up in p2pkh addresses.  Even once segwit is activated, I can still send to other p2pkh addresses. The full throughput benefits don't occur until everyone has abandoned p2pkh, and exclusively use native segwit addresses, which haven't even been developed yet. 
I'd love to hear how the full benefits are immediate.

I think he simply means that p2sh transactions have gotten more popular in use in the last year.  Since they generally contain more witness data than p2pkh transactions, this will increase the effective blocksize limit if we switched to segwit.

Who knows.  I'm just saying that rolling out SegWit nodes does absolutely nothing to increase throughput.  It relies entirely on wallet software to comply.  I'm sure there will be a wallet that implements it quickly in a month or two, but I'm also sure that there will be wallets that don't roll out SegWit transactions for a year or more.  It's not required, and old transactions will still be valid.

I said it's not production code because it's just a function.
The max block size is currently a constant.  There are places all over the bitcoin core codebase that reference the max block size constant.  If they wanted to switch those references to call a function instead, lots of other code would have to get updated.
You can't just slap a random function in place and just magically expect the rest of the project to use it.
So it's not just my opinion.  It's a fact.  This isn't usable production code.  Pasting this function in would accomplish nothing.
Where is the actual code?  Where is the pull request that updates all references to the max block size?  Where is the code that actually makes use of this function?
Like I said.  This was a proposal, nothing more.
Additionally, it was a lazy proposal at that, because [sipa already proposed it]( (minus the insane blocksize reduction) before the HK agreement ever took place.  Look familiar? :
    uint32_t GetMaxBlockSize(int64_t nMedianTimePast) {
        // The first step is on January 1st 2017.
        if (nMedianTimePast &lt; 1483246800) {
            return 1000000;
        }
        // After that, one step happens every 2^23 seconds.
        int64_t step = (nMedianTimePast - 1483246800) &gt;&gt; 23;
        // Don't do more than 11 doublings for now.
        step = std::min&lt;int64_t&gt;(step, 175);
        // Every step is a 2^(1/16) factor.
        static const uint32_t bases[16] = {
            // bases[i] == round(1000000 * pow(2.0, (i + 1) / 16.0))
            1044274, 1090508, 1138789, 1189207,
            1241858, 1296840, 1354256, 1414214,
            1476826, 1542211, 1610490, 1681793,
            1756252, 1834008, 1915207, 2000000
        };
        return bases[step &amp; 15] &lt;&lt; (step / 16);
    }

No, it wouldn't force you to do anything. It's just that you wouldn't be able to personally verify transactions unless you upgraded.  The same could be said for the upcoming segwit softfork.

I exclusively use my trezor through the mycelium app on my phone.  Am I missing out on much by not using the official myTrezor web app?
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:31:39
The reason is so that this can be deployed without hard forking.
This is my understanding, so someone correct me if I'm wrong.
If at any time a block is created that's more than 1mb, we have a forked chain situation.  We want to obviously avoid this.  Each block still needs to be under 1mb.  But the witness data isn't seen or counted by older nodes.  So we can squeeze more transactions into a block if we remove all witness data.
So old nodes still enforce 1mb, but many more transactions can fit into that 1mb since witness data isn't counted.  New, segwit nodes will have a 4mb max blocksize, but all transaction data is multiplied by 4.  So a block will still be 1mb (4mb/4=1mb).  However, witness data is not multiplied at all.  
So this is the new formula for calculating the size of a transaction:
    (tx data * 4) + SegWit data
This ensures that old nodes and new nodes alike will accept the blocks, even though they will be larger than 1mb.
In reality, the new max block size will act as if it's around 1.6 or 1.7mb after all wallets are exclusively creating segwit transactions..
*edit: added some more details*
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:35:29


Going to 2mb blocks doesn't change decentralization.  If anything, bitcoin development is way *too* centralized today.  Having multiple clients helps improve our current single point of failure.


That's not what's happening.  People want larger blocks because blocks are full.  I don't want consensus rules dictated by a corporation whose business model depends on particular rules.  I want Satoshi's original vision.


First, it's not a trick.  This is how consensus algorithms work.  This is by design.  Second, I am opposed to raising the 21m supply limit.  However if more than 75% of the hashing power wants to raise that limit, there's nothing anyone can do about it.  That's how this system is designed.


We don't know any such thing.  What a load of horse shit that is.  I highly doubt there would ever be &gt;75% consensus to raise the 21m supply limit in bitcoin, because that creates additional inflation, which means everyone's stake in bitcoin is reduced.  No one will ever agree to voluntarily reduce their stake.  That's asinine.

It's going to take more than 2 days on a raspberry pi, even with a lot of bandwidth.  You have to reduce memory usage to avoid bitcoind crashing, and that's going to slow down verification of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:44:24
Right now pools are connecting to other pools and guessing when they find a block by waiting for them to issue new work to their miners.  When they get new work, they issue that to their own pool and start mining a new empty block without validating the recently found block. They just assume it's valid.  This requires custom code so not all pools do this.
What Gavin is proposing is to standardizes this practice so that instead of guessing that a block is found and mining on top of it without validating it, you can just download the header and validate it.  This evens the playing field, so all miners can participate, and also minimizes the risk of orphan blocks.
The sketchy process of pools connecting to other pools, guessing when they find a block, then assuming that block is valid without verifying it, can end.

I'd agree that people are free to choose their implementation. There is an economic incentive to remain in consensus with the network.

I don't believe that's a fair comparison.  But if there was a cat vs dog debate that became an extremely hot topic in the cat community, I would consider posts that compare the two to be allowed.

Also, there have been plenty of posts removed just for criticizing core.

@_date: 2016-01-21 13:37:01
Some miners are choosing to mine blocks under the max limit, and I like that they have the option to do that.  In a world with a 2mb max blocksize limit, I would respect miners who choose to continue to mine at 1mb.  That's their choice.  But since a few large mining pools have shown public support for 2mb blocks, I would look forward to the increased volume we'd be able to handle.

@_date: 2017-03-01 14:58:50
Just doing some thinking...
If miners want to incorporate these performance enhancements, but don't want to signal for segwit, will they upgrade to 0.14, but simply change the signal flag and recompile?
So if segwit was manually activated, without 95% of miners signaling support, it's likely that the miners would actually validate and include segwit txs in blocks anyway, since they will be running 0.14+?
Or are the non-segwit miners still running pre-0.13 core code?

Not everyone runs their own node.  An "economic node" is a single node that serves thousands or millions of people.
For instance, my node at home just serves me.  If I run Core or BU, it doesn't really affect the network, or the economic majority.  Nobody cares about my node.
However, MyCelium runs a few nodes that thousands of people rely on.  Everyone using the MyCelium wallet relies on MyCelium nodes to tell them the truth about their bitcoin.
If MyCelium said "our nodes will stay with Core, even in the event of a chain split", then that has *a lot* of weight.  The thousands of people using MyCelium will stay on the Core branch, *regardless* of how much hashpower the BU side of the fork may have.
If a large majority of these "economic nodes" stick with Core, then it doesn't matter how much hashpower a future BU chain has.  No one is going to recognize or care about that blockchain.  In that event, the BU coin will trade a much lower price, since no one recognizes it.  Miners will switch back to the core chain, since it has the economic majority.

This is not what Satoshi envisioned.  The longest *valid* chain is what matters.  Bitcoin nodes will not see the BU chain as valid, and will stick with the bitcoin blockchain.

If BU successfully forks with not only a strong majority of the miners, but with a strong economic majority (the support of all major exchanges, wallet services, and payment providers), and the remaining miners on the minority chain soon abandon it if favor of BU, causing the minority chain to never reach the next difficulty retarget period, and causing the old chain to be universally abandoned, then I'd agree that culturally, everyone would refer to BU as "bitcoin".
But at that point, I'd consider the original bitocin dead, since we've shown that it can be hijacked and changed.  What's to stop the miners from forking off again to remove the 21 million btc limit?

What is generally considered "socialist" today, and what is advocated by socialists in America (Bernie Sanders, AOC, etc) is Venezuelan style social and economic policies.  They want to nationalize private industries, and provide "free" services by taking money from the laborers by force.  Self proclaimed "socialists" in America advocate for the exact policies that caused the Venezuelan collapse.

But this argument is the exact opposite of the one the core devs are making.
They're saying that bitcoin classic (can I say that here?) is attempting a hostile fork without consensus.  Look at what Juke Jr actually wrote:


My point is that there is no attempt without community/economic consensus.  I believe that consensus is on the 2mb block's side.
It seems you're now arguing that who gives a fuck what anyone else thinks, we should just take whatever the core devs give us and fuck consensus.  I have not yet seen this argument used.  Props for being honest.

Configure your router so that inbound traffic on port 80 goes to port 80 on Server1, and inbound traffic on port 81 goes to port 80 on Server2.

Keynesian economists.. There will be more than 10.  Every single keynsian will say that.
I disagree with the keynsian model.
Keynes was a collectivist.  His goal was not to maximize individual liberty, or even to care about the individual at all.  He was a big-government collectivist, who never even had a background in economics.  He came up with a model that incentivized the never-ending welfare/warfare state, and encouraged governments to tax and spend as much as possible.

Here's the problem. In the US, if you work, you generally have great health care. But if you don't, you can easily get screwed. 
The people without insurance are the vast minority in America, but they absolutely drag all of our statistics down. But this isn't the average American. The vast, vast majority of Americans have great insurance and seemless access without any wait lists. 


Australia, Canada, UK, France, etc are this way at the very least. 






The "average family" represents no one.  It's just a mix of people who have insurance with people who don't. 
I have friends in the UK. They pay £300 a paycheck for the NHS. Each. So a couple pays £600 every two weeks... over £1200 a month! That's utterly insane, especially for a system that is supposedly "free".
To cover my entirely family in America costs less than half that. And I can choose any doctor I want. The UK has rationed care, and your are assigned a government doctor. If you're too old for a procedure, they simply don't treat you. Fuck every single part of that. The UK system is utter hell.

I don't disagree with any of that, at all. I fully look forward to segwit, LN, and other layer 2 scanning solutions. 
But why the fixation on 1mb blocks? Why not 1.5mb? Why not 2mb?
There is no technical argument bound exactly to 1mb.
The community is horribly divided, and needs to see a good faith effort by the core developers to begin to heal again.
Why not couple segwit with a blocksize increase proposal like 17.7% increase per year?  In my opinion, this will help create a narrative that will begin to heal this divided community.
It's not segwit or LN that is the problem, it's the stubbornness of egos involved. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:50:00


If full, with today's technical constraints, yes they would.  I'm not advocating that.


Metrics have been done to show that even 8mb blocks would not be problematic.
Again though, all I personally want to see right now is segwit, we can talk about further scaling after see how that shakes out, then Schnorr sigs, etc..
The only reason I'm bringing up an additional blocksize increase now, in addition to segwit, is to help heal this divided community, so that segwit can actually activate.  Because I'm not feeling optimistic that segwit will activate at all.

It's about a year old. New tech needs time to grow. I'm pretty impressed with that number too be honest. 


It's a network that allows you to spend bitcoin instantly and securely. With a regular on-chain bitcoin tx, you need to wait for your tx to be mined in a block. With Lightning, txs are verified instantly. 
Additionally, there is a much higher ceiling for throughput. On-chain bitcoin txs can do about 7-10 txs per second. In Lightning, it can do literally millions of txs per second.

Luke thinks that the reason why people don't run full nodes is because of the size of blocks. But even with ~1.5mb blocks, a little raspberry pi with a crappy internet connection is plenty of resources needed. I use this setup and I pay for literally the slowest internet that my ISP offers. I have over 100 peers, and the rpi runs great.
The reality is that full node usage is more closely correlated to the price of bitcoin. The higher the price, the more people who run full nodes.

You don't. You import a private key. 


How can the wallet know its a spendable output? A private key can be turned into an address for p2pkh txs. But for p2sh txs, the address is a hash of the script. The private key alone is not enough info. It would also need to know the output you're trying to spend.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:39:53
No.  When you send from the Trezor, certain UTXOs are spent entirely, and change is sent to a new address.
So for instance, say you first purchased 2 BTC from Coinbase, and then withdrew that 2BTC to your Trezor.  Your Trezor now has a single UTXO worth 2 BTC.
A few weeks later, you spend 0.1 BTC.  Your Trezor has to reveal the public key for that initial 2 BTC to spend it, but it sends 0.1 BTC to whoever you wanted to pay, then sends the remaining 1.9 BTC to a new address that it creates for you.  This is all transparent to you behind the scenes.  This keeps your public keys hidden at all times.
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:40:04


There is none. You should always invest in real bitcoin, and hold your own keys. 
However, there are literally trillions of dollars sitting in institutional investment accounts, not involved in bitcoin. An ETF gives that money an avenue to buy.
Unlike futures, an ETF must hold reserves. So if investors buy the ETF, the custodian must buy real bitcoin to back it up. This will dry up the supply. Forget the moon. We'll be going to fucking Mars.

@_date: 2017-01-30 17:54:30
You're a little confused.
BU miners will build on the longest valid chain, just like all miners do.  The block that was &gt;1mb was valid to them, but the main chain was also valid.  The main chain has much more power behind it since only ~20% of the network mines with BU, so that very quickly became the longest valid chain.  So all miners started building on the main chain, including BU miners.


No, that is not what explains it.  The 60 BU nodes were banned simply because they relayed an invalid block.  The &gt;1mb block that was mined was considered *invalid* to non-BU nodes.  BU nodes recognized it as valid and relayed it, which is what got them banned.

In a hub and spoke model, where lots of people have a single open channel with the same hub, it's simple to for any of those people to send bitcoin to each other through the hub.  This only requires 1 hop through the hub, and there are already examples of this working on testnet.

Miners simply chase the biggest profit.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  Bitcoin was designed to assume miners would always mine in their own best interest.
This is what makes bitcoin resilient through.  In order for the network to change, users would have to value the change more than the existing protocol.  The miners have no say in this, because they'll always chase the more valuable network.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:25:33
If you split out all your BCH to a new address, then yes.  Every public key for every address on your Trezor (for BTC) is now publicly visible.
Again, they are still safe as long as ECDSA is safe.  But Bitcoin keys are normally protected by both ECDSA *and* a hashing algorithm.  You're reduced to just ECDSA now.
The simplest thing to do is just to move your BTC to a new address/addresses.
You can generate segwit addresses via the Trezor beta wallet, which is what I did.

They won't reject blocks, they will just choose not to connect to those nodes.  That's all.  Every node connects to a couple dozen other nodes.  This makes a giant mesh network.  You can disconnect and reconnect to any nodes you want.

This is a trusted model.  You explicitly trust Paypal with your money.  You can only buy things that Paypal approves of.  They can stop or reverse any payment they like for any reason they want.  They can ban your account.  They can freeze your account.  They can even garnish your account if the government tells them to.  You can't buy a gun with paypal, even if it's a completely legal sale, because paypal won't let you.  That's called censorship.
With bitcoin, you trust no one.  No one can stop you from buying anything.  No one can reverse or refund your payment.  No one can ban you.  No one can freeze or garnish your funds.  That's the power of a trustless, censorship proof, decentralized, p2p currency.

The Bitcoin Cash fork proved that miner support is fleeting.  They will mine whatever chain is more profitable.  They mined BCH during any period when it became more profitable to do so, and moved back when BCH became less profitable.

A reduced inflation rate should lead to high valuation over time.  This has been seen in each of the previous halvings.
But keep in mind that it likely won't happen on that date.  If more and more hashing power continues to be added to the network, and the average time between blocks is less than 10 minutes, it'll be sooner.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:34:20
I'm going to bet that someone is going to make a patch to slap on top of core that does nothing but increase the blocksize to 2mb (block weight to 8mb) at the specific block height that segwit2x will trigger.
This will allow people who want to support segwit2x, to continue running core nodes, and not have to use the btc1 implementation.
Whether this will be successful or not is another story.

It was invalid to core nodes, but it was valid to BU nodes.

No routing is needed for a hub and spoke model, which I believe will be extremely useful right away.
There are so many bitcoin use cases today that require third party trust.  A hub and spoke LN model can remove the trust from many of these right away, without any routing needed.

@_date: 2017-08-24 21:56:21
Yes I believe that is technically possible.  But I don't know if Trezor supports that because legacy and segwit addresses will be associated with two different "accounts" within your trezor wallet.  So they might not let you mix inputs from multiple accounts.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:52:13
The miners are enforcing BIP91 and the users are enforcing BIP148, both orphan non-segwit blocks.
So a miner would be forking himself off the bitcoin chain if he stopped signaling for segwit.

92% never supported XT, Classic, or BU.
I think the most ever was like ~40% signaling BU, but even then, no miner would have ever even attempted a larger block without at least 75% support.  Or at least that's what they said.
It will be interesting to see if 92% of the miners actually start enforcing 2mb blocks.  The reality is that it'll likely come down to the exchanges.  A fork can't be successful with only 1 constituency of consensus, but if they have the majority of 3 constituencies, it can be successful, and convince the rest to also switch over.
Users and miners both have power, but so do exchanges, merchants, and wallet developers.

Yes, it was a bug that is being patched.  There have been many bugs in Bitcoin's past too.

The other model used today is the original Satoshi Dice model where every single bet takes place on the blockchain.
The Lightning Network could significantly reduce txs down to just an opening and closing tx (maybe once a day or once a week) instead of broadcasting every single bet on the blockchain.
The usage of opening/closing txs need to be used in an ideal manor.  It obviosuly makes no sense to open a payment channel if you're only going to do a single tx.  It makes much more sense to just use a standard onchain tx for that use cause.
Personally, I'm just as excited about LN mitigating trust issues as am I for LN as a scaling solution.

Also, FYI, if you split your BCH out from your BTC, then your BTC public keys are now publicly visible. This is still secure as long as ECDSA is secure, however, you're usually also protected by the security of SHA256 and RipeMD hashing.

No routing is needed in this example.  Alice and Carol both have open bidirection payment channels with Bob.  Alice wants to pay Carol via Bob.  Alice knows Carol's address and they both know they both have these channels opened with Bob.  All payment channel multisig addresses are known by all parties.  This is not a difficult problem to solve when all of this information is known by all parties.
Where actual routing becomes a problem is when Alice and Carol do not have open payment channels with the same hub.  Now, there needs to be a lot of network discovery and routing to figure out how to hop across the network.  This problem doesn't exist in a simple hub and spoke model.


Yes, channels need to be funded.  Any large entity can offer this service.  It requires no trust.  Fees can be optional for providing this liquidity.

Segwit provides a discount in fees, so yes.  Large businesses will want to take advantage of any cost saving measures.


First of all, most altcoins are rarely used as it is.  If they have no volume, then fees are close to 0 anyway, there is no real incentive.
Second, do you have proof of this?  Because technically spending to a p2sh address could be segwit, and litecoin has lots of p2sh use.  How are you determining who is using segwit?

The fact that payments can't be stopped or censored by banks, corporations, or governments. With the traditional system, governments can freeze assets, garnish your accounts, and prevent you from buying goods or services that they don't like. 
Also, the fact that there's nothing sensitive about a bitcoin transaction. With the traditional system, each transaction broadcasts all the sensitive data needed to spend from that account. It's really an asinine system if you think about.

I don't think there is a clear way of measuring it.  The market will sort it out.  It is very costly to not be in consensus.  This is what makes bitcoin very hard to change.
Miners will switch back to a non-segwit2x chain very quickly *if* the rest of the industry doesn't update their nodes to validate the new consensus rules.
Miners alone cannot force protocol changes on the rest of the network.  The bitcoin economy has to agree to adhere to those new rules too.

I meant that no blocks were actually mined on top of the orphaned block.  But yes, you're correct, where was a brief time where some BU miners were attempting to build on the invalid chain.  They all switched back to the main chain once it was longer (2 blocks later).
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:25:22
Yes, that's correct.


This assumes that miners actually produce blocks greater than 1mb during that time, which would be stupid to do, since they're be orphaned, like the one last night.  The block created last night was actually a bug.  It wasn't intentionally created.
Miners will act in their self-interest, so they likely won't start attempting to create blocks &gt;1mb until they're reasonably certain that they will be accepted.

4mb is theoretical, and impossible to achieve in reality.
Every single transaction in the block would have to be 100% witness data, and 0% non-witness data.  It is not possible to have a transaction that contains only witness data with nothing else.

You open a channel, make 200 bets over the course of a month, then close out.  You made 200 bets for a grand total of 2 blockchain txs.
The model today is that you open an account with a site like Nitrogen Sports.  You deposit 1 btc into your deposit address on your account.  Nitrogren Sports now is a trusted custodian of you money.  You have to explicitly trust Nitrogen Sports.  You gamble for a month, then cash out.

The device generates your keys.  Your private keys *never* leave the device.
You need a software wallet to interact with the Trezor.  So you can use the Trezor web wallet, or Mycelium on Android, or Electrum on your laptop.  Something like that.
The software wallet is where you control everything from.  You give it the amount and address and click send.  The software then talks with the Trezor, gives it the unsigned transaction that it generated, and says "sign this please".  The Trezor displays the information on it's little screen (address and amount) and asks for confirmation from you.  If you say yes, the Trezor signs the txs, and sends it back to the software, who broadcasts it out.
You only need the Trezor physically plugged in when sending from it.  If you want to receive money on your Trezor, your wallet can handle that on its own.  When you first connect the Trezor to say, your Android device, it imports the public keys (addresses).  So later, when your Trezor is safely buried underground, you can flash a QR code from your phone to anyone who needs to pay you, and your money is sent to your Trezor for safe keeping.
The fact that your private keys never leave the device is why it's secure.  They can't be hacked because your keys are always offline.  Even if the software you use is compromised, your Trezor and bitcoin are safe.

You can't just declare that someone accepted a compromise on their behalf.  You realize there's an entire subreddit of bigblockers who *do not* accept this as a compromise, right?
Listen, at this point, I want segwit to activate as soon as possible.  I think it's good tech that makes bitcoin better.
But this was not an agreed upon compromise.  The big blockers want a hard fork to increase the block size.  They started with 20mb, went down to 8mb, then to 2mb.  There was no compromise.  The core devs ignored that, and moved forward with segwit.  The community is now *very* split on the issue.


Understood.  I never disputed that.  I simply said that the big blockers never agreed to segwit as a compromise.  This was a one-sided approach, and I think that shows in the number of miners backing each proposal right now (12% for BU, 22% for segwit).

There was no explicit signaling for BIP148.  BIP148 simply said that all blocks after August 1 that didn't signal for segwit would be orphaned.

And what I'm saying is that a hub can be chosen manually, not automatically discovered.  Or perhaps to start, a single "Coinbase LN" app can be made, where it's known in advance that everyone has an open channel with Coinbase.
I imagine gambling sites could benefit from a model like this.
Obviously, in the long run, it's not ideal for each hub to have a separate app, but my point is that there are other options besides networking where hubs can be chosen.

You do realize that if the max blocksize limit was raised to 8mb, that blocks wouldn't just magically be 8mb, right?


In what world would that exist?  If you want to store a record of every transaction that has ever occurred, you need storage.  Just saying, "well I don't want to buy a new hard drive every decade" isn't an answer.  A single, cheap hard drive isn't a limiting factor.
Also, Segwit adds additional overhead in each transaction.  So if anything, it will add even more bloat to the blockchain that doesn't exist today.


Data centers?  Dude, even in your completely-full 8mb example, we're only talking about a few terabytes every DECADE.  We're talking ~$120 a decade assuming prices don't go down, and hard drive technology doesn't ever get any better.  What does that have to do with a data center??

I never said miners make the rules.  Consensus determines the rules.
But I do acknowledge that there are multiple parties that have a say in that.  Miners do have their power, but so do users, exchanges, merchants, and developers.
No one group completely controls it.  The UASF proved that the users have some muscle to flex.  But if exchanges, wallet devs, merchants, and miners all decide on enforcing new rules, the regular users alone can't really fight this.
Right now, Segwit2x seems to have overwhelming miner support.  That alone is not enough to change consensus rules.  But if they get exchanges, wallets, and merchants on board, it will be a done deal.
If miner support drops to something like 60% or less, then it'll fail immediately IMO.

If BCH proves anything at all, it's that miners will blindly mine whichever chain is more profitable.
2x has no EDA mechanism built in, so even if they do fork off, the 2x chain will slowly grind to a halt as miners switch back to the more profitable bitcoin chain.
Ultimately, I think the miners realize this (or will figure it out before November), and chose not to fork.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:19:51
The same thing has happened before.  A large segwit miner likely got really lucky for a few hours, and the 24 hour metric jumped.
The 1000 block number hasn't really moved though, and it won't unless large mining pools start supporting segit.  None have done that in the last day, which tells me that the 1000 block metric isn't going to make any significant changes.

Forget the concept of weight for now.
A segwit block today can be as large as 4mb according to the Bitcoin protocol rules that are in effect.  In practice, that number is more like 3.7mb, just because it's not possible to actually make a block that's 4.0mb that adheres to all the other protocol rules.
Back in December for instance, when Bitcoin exploded in usage, the vast majority of all blocks were over 1mb in actual size.
When a legacy node requests a block from a current (segwit) node, the segwit node strips the block down to under 1mb by not sending the segwit signatures.
How this is possible is that the tx data structure has an additional section where the segwit signatures are stored.  Legacy nodes don't see this extra section.  So the old structure is essentially the part that needs to be under 1mb, but you can add up to 3mb of signatures in this new "section".
Hope this helps.

Can you clarify what you mean by "adoption"?  Price is an indicator of adoption, which has been steadily increasing.  Are you talking about retail?
If so, I think you should reconsider your metrics for success.  Trivial consumer retail is not an important market to capture.  The average Joe isn't begging for another checkout option at Walmart.  This isn't what's going to define success.

1. Bandwidth.  Running a node takes a lot of bandwidth.  This can be resolved with some form of thin blocks.  Again, no one cares about a stupid $40 hard drive.
2. Because there's no immediate benefit for the average user.  Unless you're a miner, a developer, an exchange, or a bitcoin service provider, most users just want to be in control of their private keys and send/receive transactions.  You don't *need* a full node for that.
The physical drive in which to store the blockchain is the *least* significant part of running a full node.  Anyone can get a cheap hard drive and be safe with storage requirements for decades to come.
This is not to say that there are no benefits to running a full node.  There are many, including the obvious; the ability to fully validate all blocks.  All I'm saying is that the physical storage is the most irrelevant part.  We should fix the bug that requires nodes to download each transaction multiple times.  That would save a huge amount of bandwidth.

This makes no sense. There have been a plethora of changes since the original bitcoin release.
Hell, the entire concept of p2sh (multisig) was the baseline for how segwit was implemented. It created a new data structure that old nodes could not see nor verify. This is what the segwit design was based on.
Everyone happily went along with that change, including the BCH guys who still have p2sh implemented.

Soft forks can still split the blockchain.
The basic difference of a hard fork vs a soft fork is that a hard fork *breaks* an existing rule, while a soft fork doesn't break any rules.  A soft fork adds a new rule.
So, as as example, if the current protocol rules say that the max blocksize is 1mb, then to change that to 2mb *breaks* the existing rule.  A 1.5mb block would be invalid to the 1mb chain, but valid to the 2mb chain.  That's a hard fork.
However, making the existing max blocksize limit smaller, would be a soft fork.  If the new rules say that the max blocksize is 300kb, then that doesn't break any existing rules.  300kb blocks are valid on both chains.
But this new change can still cause a split.  If only 30% of the nodes/miners enforce the new rule, but 70% stick with the existing rules, there's a disagreement.  The 70% will continue to make and enforce 1mb blocks.  These blocks will be invalid to the chain that enforces the 300lb limit.  So the 300kb chain will reject these blocks.

There is nothing unique about bitcoin mining hardware. They are just sha256 Asic chips. Anyone is free to produce them. They are no different than graphics cards in regard to centralization. There just happen to be fewer manufacturers. 


First of all, there is no such thing as ASIC resistance. An ASIC chip can be fabricated for any mining algorithm. Second, ASICs ensure that it's harder for an entity to attack, because the hash rate is so much higher. Which is why we regularly see 51% attacks on "asic resistant" altcoins like Vertcoin, ETC, and others.

Since batching was prioritized by many exchanges and wallets, each tx now represents a larger amount of economic activity.
Back in 2017, each tx represented a single transfer of funds.  Today, each tx can represent dozens of transfers to different parties.  Economic activity that used to take 30 txs, can easily happen in just one tx now.
This means that at the same number of txs, much more economic activity is represented.
Plus we didn't talk about txs that moved to second layer networks.

I wouldn't worry too much.
There are basically three outcomes to this (that I can see):
* BitcoinXT legitimately gains &gt;75% consensus among miners.  Everyone running core will be given a two week notice that they'll be on the losing side of the fork (&lt;25% mining power) and they'll be urged to switch.  Miners who refuse to switch will become irrelevant and work only on an orphaned chain.  In this scenario, XT wins and bigger blocks are here for real.  Your coins are safe.
* BitcoinXT never gains 75% consensus.  Nothing changes at all.  Your coins are safe.
* Enough miners spoof the BitcoinXT version number to prematurely trigger a fork without any real mining power supporting it.  BitcoinXT prematurely forks itself into irrelevancy.  Your coins are safe.
This is really it.  So no matter what, I wouldn’t worry about your coins.  The price will definitely be volatile through all this, but it will quite down shortly after one of these three scenarios happens.
Anyone, please feel free to add additional potential scenarios to this list.

I think it's two-fold.  First, the number of full nodes is shrinking, likely because of the resources required to sync from scratch.  The growth of the blockchain is outpacing technical growth, which means it's only going to get harder.  If we limit blocks now, for a period of time, it gives hardware/bandwidth time to catch up, so that it gets easier to sync down the road, encouraging more full nodes.
But second, yes, I also believe it's to encourage a fee market to provide miners with more income/incentive to continue mining.  It has nothing to do with 2140.  More so with the upcoming subsidy reductions.  The reward will drop to just 3.125 in about 5 years.  So fees will need to be the larger share of the block reward by then.

Temporarily, only if volume goes back down under ~5-7tx/s.  What if a growth in tx/s is sustained?  These fees are not temporary at all.  This submission has Peter Todd talking positively about $20 transaction fees.


I don't accept your premise.  More users means potentially more decentralization.  A higher blocksize might mean that you can't run a full node on AOL dialup, but there are literally millions of people in the world who have access to gigbit bandwidth.

@_date: 2015-08-13 16:26:51


I'm not advocating that, or saying that's going to happen.  Taking 10 minutes to relay a block would mean their bandwidth would be constrained to 0.85mbps (for 8MB blocks).  Most people have access to at least 5mbps (up) and many have 10mbps+ (especially mining pools).
So in reality, with 8MB blocks, even having just 5mbps of bandwidth would mean you're relaying blocks within about a minute and a half (as opposed to 30 seconds with 17mbps).
5mbps upload is pretty standard at &lt;$50/mo in the US.  I imagine it's even cheaper in Europe..  Additionally, every year bandwidth is easier to come by and cheaper..  Hell, you can easily get a gigabit line in pretty much any city in the US right now.
I really don't see anything that supports your claim that 8mb blocks are the "end for Bitcoin as a decentralised currency" after running these numbers.  However, I will admit that this conversation has made me much less worried about a future where the max blocksize isn't immediately increased though.  So thank you for your time and explaining all this in detail.
I would love to see a compromise between you and Gavin/Mike.  Perhaps 4MB blocks with a dynamic growth based on actual usage, not exponential.  Would there be more support for something like that among the core devs?

I agree with most of your concerns.  However, I think at some point *some* txs must be moved off the blockchain (or at least to a different altcoin blockchain).  We'd need extremely large multi-GB blocks to handle the daily tx volume of a country..
I think there will be many networks that will provide partial solutions.  I think the LN will handle all micropayments, altcoins will handle small payments (subjective), and bitcoin will handle large transfers (also subjective).
But I don't think bitcoin alone can handle the full spectrum of payments for hundreds of millions of users.  Blocks would be too big and centralization *will* occur.
Having said that, I still believe that 1MB blocks are just way too small, which is why I said that the LN is not an alternative to blocksize increases.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:38:41
I remember reading that someone tested the Lightning network throughput rate and it topped out at about 250 txs per second per channel.
So with about 23,000 channels active right now, that's about 5.7 million txs per second as a theoretical limit on the Lightning network.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:36:18
No.  75% needs to be maintained for a minimum of 2 weeks.  Also, it's hardcoded that no changes will be made until January 2016 regardless of percentages.
Last, even once a super-majority is reached and maintained for 2 weeks, and we reach January 2016, no fork occurs until a block larger than 1MB is mined.
If we don't have another spam attack, this could still take a few additional months.  Miners are incentivized to keep blocks as small as possible (propagation to the network is easier when blocks are smaller).  So until there is enough traffic to justify &gt;1MB blocks, there will be no fork.
All of this was planned out really fucking well in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:50:07


Agreed.  This is where the debate comes in.. Should every user in every remote corner of the globe be able to run a node with 500kbps bandwidth?   I don't think so.  Consumer bandwidth is exploding.  Comcast has options that scale into multiple Gbps.  No, I don't pay  $200/mo for that, but it's an option that millions of people have.
Centralization will occur with massive block sizes, but I'm not concerned with 8mb blocks.  I think many people are even willing to compromise on 4mb blocks with a Sipa-style growth rate.  But we need a bump right now to handle any potential surges in bitcoin popularity.

Why not?  Supporting XT is supporting a truly decentralized piece of software.  We need to support the developers who won't hold bitcoin hostage.
There's no real downside to switch to XT.  If a network consensus is not reached, the max blocksize stays at 1MB.  If and only if a super-majority consensus is reach is when blocks &gt;1MB will be allowed.
Running XT ensures you stay on the winning side.

Just curious, how big is your hard drive and how much free space do you have?
Blocks are only as big as the number of transactions in them.  We currently only [average blocksizes around 500-600kb today](  Just because the max blocksize increases doesn't mean blocks will magically be 8mb.  There needs to be more daily transaction volume to fill the blocks.  This is just a preemptive move, so that we don't get serious network delays.
This isn't going to be something that's going to sneak up on you and fill your hard drive overnight.  You will see it coming.
Additionally, the earliest this change can possibly happen is January 2016.. There is plenty of time to monitor what's going on.

Yes, but again how does that dispute what I said?
There were examples on testnet of blocks containing almost 9000 segwit txs, and only being 1.8mb (normal blocks today contain like 2500 txs). My only claim was that if segwit were used more, blocks can contain double as many txs as now.

It's literally the definition of arbitrary.
Nothing you linked to explained why 1MB *isn't* arbitrary.
Unless you can prove that 1MB represents some physical limitation that can not otherwise be avoided, then it most certainly is arbitrary.
The reason you can't do that, is because it varies.  There is some physical (non-arbitrary) limit that exists, but it differs person to person.  Someone with a 500kpbs internet connection and a 50gb hard drive has a much different limit than someone with a 200Mbps connection and a 10tb hard drive.
You can argue in defense of arbitrary limits all day.  But stop lying about these limits *not* being arbitrary.  They most certainly are.
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:46:41
I would potentially support ideas like this.  I really would.
But here's the problem.  The core developers who work for blockstream will not come to any consensus on *any* block size increase.  They are being paid to make sure blocks stay artificially small.

If 80% of the miners leave, then the chain is 80% slower. So if a normal block is 10 minutes on average, a block would be 50 minutes.
The math looks like this:

My post was not meant to bash LN.  I think the idea is useful, and I even said that I think we will end up all using it at some point.. However, I do have some serious centralization concerns.
I honeslty like the idea of using altcoins as opposed to LN though.  I like direct p2p payments better than relying on a third party.  What I like more than altcoins is bitcoin though.
There is a happy middle ground somewhere in all of this.  Between raised block sizes, LN, and a bigger reliance on altcoins, there is room for compromise.
I just think that raising the max bitcoin blocksize is an important part of this.

You're shilling the wrong way then.  You should be getting paid.  You do campaigning on their behalf routinely.


I disagree.  I believe the vocal core developers want to keep 1MB in place.  Their "proposals" are half-hearted and absolutely nothing's been coded.  The only points they make are against Gavin/Hearn.  They rarely make strong pushes for alternative proposals.
Satoshi's idea was the cleanest and simplest.  Put some code in like this:
    if (blockheight &gt; 500000)
        maxblocksize = 8000000
This should have been included in every build from 0.10 on.  That way when block 500000 (or whatever it was set to) comes, it's already implemented in 99% of the nodes out there, who are all running 0.11 or newer.  This would have ensured a completely transparent and seamless fork where there was &gt;99% consensus months in advance.
The core team fought this.  This was what Gavin wanted.  This is what Satoshi wanted.
So Gavin decided to implement this on his own with BitcoinXT.  As long as a supermajority is reached, there will be no issue with the fork.  But as long as the core devs continue to close their eyes, stick their fingers in their ears, and stomp their feet, it's going to be a mess.
I believe that if a super-majoirty is reached, core will be forced to concede and include BIP101.  But we'll see how this all plays out.

I think there was a lot of confusion with 2x coming out, and companies were dedicating engineering efforts to support that fork, plus the Cash fork, and possible even the Gold fork.
Core even had to push back extra segwit features because they were dedicating their time to prepare for the 2x fork.
Now that all this uncertainty is out of the way, I believe we'll begin to see more and more segwit use.
Changing tx format is not a trivial thing to do. It will take time.
The block sizes you see will only increase when segwit usage increases.  That's literally the point of my post.  Let's convince companies to start using segwit.

The good thing about competitive markets is that these questions can actually be answered individually.  Additionally, private protection services would have an incentive of providing a good service.
If their response time sucked, they would lose customers to competitors.  If they were too trigger happy, they'd be saddled with law suits.  They would have to provide a good service, or go bankrupt.
Meanwhile, government funded police have no such incentive.  They are routinely trigger happy, and there are no consequences.  The tax payers pay out for any law suits, and the murderous cops get a paid vacation when they shoot someone.  They they all have a laugh.  If their response times suck, who cares?  The tax payers have no choice.

I have no issues with off chain transactions and overlay networks such as changetip.  I *use* some of these networks.  My problem is when this is advocated over the use of actual bitcoin.
Additionally, I don't want people putting arbitrary and artificial limits on bitcoin use.  1MB is arbitrarily small.  Upping the limit to allow bitcoin usage to grow, but still keeping it low enough where an average person can run a node is significant and realistic.  This limit should grow as technology grows to ensure decentralization *and* growth.
Limiting transaction volume won't push people to overlay networks.  It'll push people to altcoins.  1MB blocks are a joke, and bitcoin will become irrelevant if it stays that way.
Thankfully, good people are doing work to make sure that doesn't happen.  In the months following the release of BitcoinXT, I believe we'll see a large percentage of miners and nodes switching over to it.  A blocksize increase will win, because it's the only thing that makes sense.

These are two things that Paypal does today.  This is why people want a p2p system, so central payment processors *cannot* deny transactions and freeze funds.


I understand that.  I think the LN is a much better solution than paypal.  But as I've brought up, they do represent some (not all) of the exact same problems.


Why wasn't this silly when Satoshi published his whitepaper?  Why is it only silly now?
I'm not advocating that everyone needs to publish stupid little 5 cent txs to the blockchain, but with growth in the userbase and blocksize at 1MB, this isn't the issue being debated.  There will be larger txs that simply cannot fit into blocks because of future network congestion.
I'm cool with LN existing.  I think it will solve problems.  We all use changetip today and that is a wholly trusted third party like paypal.  I'd rather use a LN approach than changetip.  So I absolutely do think that LN has a place in the market.

It wasn't the threat of an increase that was so bad, it was the method. It was the fact that they thought they could dictate a protocol change by force. In glad we fought them off. It proves bitcoin's survivability against attacks. 




Segwit for starters. We have the ability to double tx capacity if segwit was adopted in greater numbers. This comes down to large service providers like Coinbase and Gemini switching over as BitGo and Shapeshift have done.

@_date: 2015-08-10 17:34:43
You're separating nodes and mining.  I'm not talking about a scenario where *only* miners switch to XT, but full nodes stay on core.  That would be insane.
Of course nodes need to switch to XT as well.
No one is looking at incentive here.
Miners won't switch to XT if the nodes won't support larger blocks.  Miners would lose profit if that happened.  So nodes have to start switching over first, which will then incentivize miners to do the same.
Besides the blockstream team and their alt-accounts, everyone wants blocks greater than 1MB.  Sure, people are going to be afraid to jump in the water first, but once we see XT node numbers climbing, we will see miners switching over to XT as well.  As miners change over, we'll see exchanges change over.  Why would an exchange stay on a defunct orphaned chain if the majority of nodes and miners are using XT?
Running XT ensures you are on the winning side of the debate.  If the community rejects BIP 101, XT will change nothing, and continue to also reject &gt;1MB blocks just like core.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:07:21
I wouldn't try to risk anything by gaming two blockchains..
First of all, since all of your coins were acquired *before* any potential future fork, the transaction will be valid on both chains.  So if you try to trade your bitcoin to someone on the "core" chain, they can re-broadcast your transaction to the "XT" chain to ensure you don't double spend, or vice versa.  Again, that transaction will be valid on both chains.
Second, the way it was coded is that no change will occur until 2 weeks after more than 75% of all hashing power is dedicated to XT.  So there's a possibility that this never occurs.  If it does occur, no one is going to want to be on the losing chain, so during that 2 week grace period, the idea is that the remainder of miners and nodes (&lt;25%) will move over to XT to avoid being forked into irrelevancy.
Additionally, some of the core devs have (at least partially) admitted that in the (unlikely) scenario that XT does gain more than 75% of the hashing power, they will likely push out an update to bitcoin core that is compatible, so that everyone is on the same chain..
Ideally, the core developers will merge a blocksize increase of their own into core, and most people who are supporting XT will back away and just go back to core, which will make XT irrelevant.
I really wouldn't worry.  It's either going to work or it isn't.  Your coins are safe.

Here's the reality..  XT is supposed to be hostile.  It's a fallback plan.
The real victory would be if the remainder of core devs got their heads out of their asses.
Someone create a new BIP, a compromise.  Code it.  Make a pull request.  Include it into bitcoin core.
If people see progress, they'll abandon XT.  However if no compromise is attempted, if no effort is given by the core devs towards a consensus, if no proposals are adopted, then people will start switching to XT in large numbers.
XT struck the first blow.  Doing nothing means XT wins.  I believe that.  XT will win if absolutely no response is made from core.  However, there is still time.
There is a lot of room between BIP101 and doing nothing.  Sipa's proposal was extremely conservative, but where is the code?  Without that, I find it hard to take it seriously.
Instead of a jump to 8MB with a doubling every 2 years, how about a jump to 3MB and then double every 3 years?  How about a dynamic limit that changes every 1000 blocks based on actual volume?  There's plenty of middle ground.
Doing nothing is conceding.  I want to see a legitimate response.

@_date: 2015-08-17 12:02:24
I understand that it takes time. But this has been ignored for years.
As Satoshi suggested years ago, a blocksize increase should have been put in place to go into effect when a certain block height was reached.
So for instance, version 0.9 and later could have all had a blockheight check and blocksize increase in place scheduled for some time in 2016. This way everyone would have already been upgraded ~2 years in advance. This would have made a fork completely transparent. 
Gavin has suggested this for months if not years and has been ignored.

Honest question.  Why do you have such a crappy, below-average internet connection?  Cheap internet is everywhere.
Also, do you believe a node should be able to be run by people with below average internet connections?  What sense does that make?  Decentralization can still be achieved without this as a requirement.
The more user running bitcoin, the more nodes there will be.  Growing the user base will increase decentralization, not decrease it.

I'm not saying there's been no debate. I'm saying there are no real proposals that exist. I referenced Sipa's proposal and why I thought it was half hearted and hard to take seriously.

You do realize that blocks won't just immediatly jump to 8MB, right?
This simply allows blocks larger than 1MB *if necessary* (due to growing transaction volume).  Miners still have an incentive to keep blocks as small as possible.
@_date: 2015-08-17 12:51:17
Yea, that logic makes so much sense.  To increase decentralization, we must artificially limit the number of people who can use the system..  Just what?!?
The more people using bitcoin, the more decentralization we can attain.  
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:19:21
But my point is that the exact same HD space will be needed regardless of the max blocksize.  So if you're saying you can't handle that, then you shouldn't be running a node in either case.
All transactions will eventually be on your hard drive.  It matters not whether they're grouped together in 8MB blocks or 1MB blocks.  The combined size of transactions are identical in both cases.
In fact, due to some overhead, there might actually be *more* space taken up on your hard drive by grouping them into smaller blocks (due to block overhead).

@_date: 2015-08-11 19:09:07
If there are 5 GB of transactions over a month, it doesn't matter if they are processed efficiently in 8mb blocks, or spaced out in 1mb blocks with severe network delays.  Those 5GBs are getting written to your hard drive.
Why is this so hard to understand?  **The max blocksize does not dictate how much space on your hard drive will be taken up, the number of confirmed transactions does**.
The number of transactions don't magically change when you make the max blocksize larger.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:53:22


First, why do you assume we're that far away?  I routinely see blocks close to 1MB today.
Second, it will take time (potentially months) to implement a new max blocksize and schedule a hard fork.  You're willing to accept the risk of months of congestion, horribly slow confirmation times, and potentially turning off new users?
Third, if you're already conceding that max blocksize should be increased if we see significant network growth and congestion, then why not just implement something now?  Let's be proactive instead of reactive.  That's a safer plan of action.  Why potentially put ourselves in the situation where we're backed into a corner?
I will say that I do think the lightning network will solve a lot of this, and I just hope you're right.  I hope it's ready before a large sustained spike in transaction volume.  I'm definitely much more concerned than you seem to be.  It seems your position is just betting on slow bitcoin adoption rates, and a quick implementation of the lightning network.  However, even with the lightning network, won't we *still* want to raise the max blocksize?  Even as a settlement layer, surely you can see that 1MB blocks are insanely small.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:40:24


Those two statements aren't mutually exclusive.  You did both.


Which you never acknowledged or responded to.


I'm aware.  As I've stated many times, side chains, the lightning network, and blockstream all have a legitimate role to play in the future of cryptocurrencies.  But none of this is an argument in favor of 1MB block sizes.


Why do you always bring this up?  It's not relevant at all!  I'm not advocating to raise block sizes to match Visa's volume today.
If bitcoin ever needs to handle Visa's volume, we'll need side chains, the lightning network, or something similar.  I'm not denying that.
But what I'm saying is that we just need breathing room right now.  Let side chains get developed and tested further, so that in 5 years when they're needed, we can implement them flawlessly.
Today, we need blocks larger than 1mb though.  1mb is nothing.  It's a toy.  It's irrelevant.  If bitcoin activity doubled, we'd see significant and long term network delays.  This is a failing plan.  This is not realistic.
Raising to 8mb gives us breathing room, still allows anyone to easily run a node, and still allows your employer to find their niche and profit handsomely.
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:44:01


This truth of this statement changes depending on when you're talking about and how much volume is going on at that time.
No one can predict how much growth bitcoin is going to see in the next year, 5 years, decade, or century.
Is 8MB enough for today?  Absolutely.  Next 2 years?  Yea, probably.  Possibly even the next 5 years.
There are two parts to increasing the max blocksize; the short term goal, and the long term goal.  I think BIP101 addresses it all.  8MB now, and double that capacity every two years (~40% growth per year) until we hit 8GB blocks in 2036.
Seems reasonable to me.  Also keep in mind that just because the max blocksize is raised doesn't mean all blocks will be that size.  We have 1MB blocks today and regularly produce 350kb blocks..

XT is going to have two releases.  Full XT with all their patches, plus support 8mb blocks.  And just core plus support for 8mb blocks.
Additionally, you could run a core node and simply change the max blocksize to 8mb yourself.  This will be compatible with 8mb blocks created by XT miners.
@_date: 2015-08-06 20:20:52
It's Gavin Anderson/Mike Hearn's implementation.
They forked bitcoin, then added in logic to switch to 8mb blocks only when a super-majority consensus is formed (&gt;=75%).
Additionally, have you thought of forking bitcoin core yourself, hosting your modified code on github, and campaigning for others to use your version too?
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:37:21
Opening something up to the "free market" doesn't mean everyone will have input.  It simply means that anyone is free to provide solutions.
What Gavin/Mike have done is given everyone an option.  They have expanded the field of available options to choose from.
Even if this isn't what you were referring to, it doesn't matter.  They've used a free market to provide their solution.  Don't like it?  Don't use it.
As I said, it's clear that the development process at core is either broken or corrupt.  So I respect Gavin/Mike for giving me an option and a voice.
Now, I don't think BIP101 is the best solution.  Nor do I want to run all the extra features of XT.  So I'm not sold, and this isn't over.  But I recognize and respect how they're benefiting and enhancing the bitcoin community.  Without XT, this debate would be small, insignificant, and pushed off for months.  XT is making this debate loud and and immediate.

Replace By Fee.
It lets you bump the fee of an unconfirmed tx. So you would broadcast a tx with no fee, wait for it to be confirmed on the chain with less of a backlog, then bump the fee on the other chain.
The result will be that each tx will have a different txid. This splits the coins. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:55:30


Fees... Isn't that obvious?  I explained how I support fees and understand why they're necessary, but there's no need to *force* high fees on users when the block reward is so high.  However, we're no where near that.  Bitcoin is still in the phase where there is millions of dollars of inflation built in to the system.


That doesn't make any sense.  LN is getting built regardless of blocksize.  It will have value regardless of blocksize.  Blocks can only be so big anyway before we run into serious centralization problems.
You keep missing my point.  This is all about timing in my eyes.  That's it.  Fees are necessary.  LN will play a role in the future.  Decentralization is extremely important.  I agree with all of that.  However, my only point is basically that 1MB is too low and it should be raised.  That's it.  Everything else will happen with time.


No it doesn't.  The network will choose.  Bitcoin is a consensus network.  BitcoinXT will get consensus and create a fork, or Bitcoin core will adopt an increase of its own and Kill XT in its tracks.  That's really it.  Don't fear a two-chain scenario, it's all FUD.

This still adds a layer of trust.  My tx is no longer p2p, and the LN node in the middle must be willing to facilitate my tx.
These will become big heads to lop off from a regulation point of view.


Mining tends to centralize into big pools to make payouts steadier.  If government regulators went after F2pool or another large mining entity, all of the individual miners who make up that pool can just migrate to another pool, or solo mine.  There is no equivalent to this with LN.  We've seen this when Ghash.io came close to having &gt;50% of all mining power.  Switching pools is trivial.
If a giant datacenter mining farm got shut down, difficulty would drop, incentivizing more individuals to mine.

There was a split among the developers, so a couple devs forked the bitcoin repository (something anyone can do, including you!) and made some modifications.
They then went on a social media campaign, trying to get people to use their software.  Everyone who is switching to XT knows what they're getting into.  In fact, it's like they're voting on which to use.

I'm not disputing that.  I understand this.  What I have a problem with is that the LN is being pushed as an alternative to increasing the blocksize, which I don't believe it is.
Artificially and arbitrarily limiting blocks to 1MB will make it more and more unrealistic to use the blockchain for things other than large settlements.  This will mean that we *must* use LN or face very high fees.


But it does if you aren't rich enough to pay the artificially high bitcoin fees.
I like the idea of a LN and will probably use it if available in the future, because it will save cost.  But developers shouldn't be in the business of creating artifically high fee markets that price users out of bitcoin.
There is a middleground we can reach.  Block sizes can be raised and still preserve decentralization all while the LN exists as well.

How so?  I understand the argument that larger blocks will centralize nodes, but 1MB vs 8MB seems trivial.  I would totally understand if BIP101 was trying to push through 200MB blocks or something extreme, but 8MB blocks aren't a massive increase.  Any crappy computer with a shitty comcast line should be able to run a node in a world with 8MB blocks.
Also, if there really are enough transactions to completely fill up 8MB blocks every ten minutes (something I doubt we'll see by next year), what are we suppose to do with those transactions with a 1MB blocksize in place?

I think he means "real world options".  Proposals are cheap and intangible.
To a skeptic like myself, I see two options; remain with core which has no blocksize increase at all, or go to XT which has implemented BIP101.
I don't even think BIP101 is that great of a plan.  I'd much rather see a compromise to something like a jump to 4MB, then just use Sipa's increase approach.  But here's the thing, I don't have that as an actual option.
I support XT because it's tangible.  The core team can kill XT for good tomorrow by agreeing to a compromise.  But I just don't see that happening.  If it does, then I'll be a happy camper.  But until then, my hashes go to Slush's XT pool.

Mathematically there is.  This isn't magic.  It's data in a computer network.  We know the average size of a transaction.  We know the max blocksize.  So with some basic math, we know rough estimates of transaction volume.
8mb blocks are nothing.  It's miniscule.  Any crappy computer with a shitty Comcast line will be able to be a node, just like today.  We're not testing theoretical bandwidth limits here.

@_date: 2015-08-17 14:29:34


Then where will transactions go?  There is a very real limit to the number of transaction volume allowed in bitcoin right now.  There are different estimates, but let's call it 7tx/s.  If usage grows to the point of needed to handle 30tx/s, where will those extra 23 tx go every second?
They cannot stay on the bitcoin network.  I would rather use an altcoin than rely on a third party.  LN reduces the risk associated with trusting a third party (like paypal), but it's still more of a risk than a direct p2p payment option.
So if you don't see people using altcoins as an alternative, where do the transactions go once bitcoin is saturated?

Agreed, I simply said that it "could be interpreted as him cashing out".


We don't know how long he mined for.  The first few blocks we can definitively say are his, so if those moved, sure.  However he could move blocks that he mined later on that are ambiguous..
As far as tracking him down, there are ways to prevent this.  He could send them through a mixing service, then split them into lots of different addresses, then convert them to dogecoin, litecoin, namecoin, and other alt coins, then mix them around some more, then convert them all back to brand new bitcoin addresses, then sell them slowly.  That would basically be impossible to trace.

Yes, but they're not part of blockstream.  They forked core because core is focused on maintaining an arbitrarily low transaction volume which will help drive business to blockstream.

I was confused by what you meant.  If implemented properly (like BitcoinXT has done), a hard fork will be completely unnoticeable by anyone.  The hard-coded super-majority will ensure a consensus among at least 75% of the network hashing power.  Additionally, it will still give other miners/nodes a 2 week window to ensure everyone can prepare before the blocksize is raised.  The average user will know nothing.


No, because there's an arbitrarily miniscule number of transactions that can fit into a single block.


I'm simply using bitcoin as it was intended.


No I won't.  Yes, miner profit will decrease at each reward halving, but so what?  That's happened before and the number of miners only *increased* since then.  I'm not concerned with miners getting less profit.  If they aren't profitable, they'll drop out, which will lower the difficulty, which will incentivize more mining.  Additionally, as long as volume or price increases (or both), there will be more profit to be made.

Breaking down the door of a peaceful heroin user, destroying his house, dragging him out in chains, then locking him in a cage, "ruins" humans being too.  Yet you directly advocate that by supporting heroin laws.  In this scenario, the only people initiating violence against another person are the police.
Addiction is a health problem.  Banning the substance is futile and honestly, just plain stupid.  It does absolutely nothing to help anyone.  If you or a friend or family member is struggling with addiction, you should be free to seek help instead of fearing that the government is going to lock you in a cage.
If my child ever ends up addicted to a drug, I would rather be able to handle the situation to get her help.  I would not want her to end up in jail because it's illegal.  That's utterly insane.

Previous forks, like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), implemented replay protection.  They did this by modifying the tx format slightly so that BCH txs would be invalid on the the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.
Jeff Garzik's btc1 software does not implement reply protection.  So if you have 1 BTC in address 1axxx at the time of the fork, you'll then have 1 BTC on Bitcoin, and 1 btc1 token on the Segwit2x blockchain.  But they are both associated with the same address on each chain.
So by default, if you send your 1BTC to address 2bxxx, that same tx can be replayed on the Segwit2x chain, so your 1 btc1 token will also be sent to the address 2bxxx on that chain.
There are ways around this, but it's a delicate process.

What the fuck does that even mean?  "Complete consensus" among developers is not a good thing.  That means one person can hold up any feature for any reason.  That's insane.
The only real consensus needed in bitcoin is an economic majority.  We need hashing power, nodes and exchanges.  If bitcoinxt musters up 75%, then that is consensus.  That's what bitcoin is and has always been.
I don't know what you're worried about.  Either bitcoinxt *gets* consesnsus and we raise the max blocksize, or it doesn't and we don't.   It's not like bitcoinxt is going to create a fork with only 10% of hashing power or something. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:18:33
You're missing my point.  I agree that the processors and exchanges need to switch.  I'm simply saying that as miners switch to XT and that consensus grows, it will be easy to convince processors/exchanges to switch as well.
They want to be on the winning side, because that's where the profit will be.  Keep in mind that they operate for a profit.  THey understand the risk of being orphaned into an irrelvant minority of users, and have an incentive to pick whichever chain has the most power behind it.
You are right that there will be problems if *only* miners switch and no one else.  What I'm saying is that's extremely unlikely.
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:20:10


Wildly speculative.  Mining will always have an equilibrium.  The more mining shrinks, the more accessible it will be for the average person to mine.  The more profitable mining becomes (do to less and less miners), the the more people will jump on the bandwagon.  Bitcoin mining difficulty will facilitate this shift.


No it isn't.  In bitcoin, the majority decides what's what.  The bitcoinxt proposed hard fork only occurs if a super-majority of the network gets on board.  In this case, bitcoin is still bitcoin, but the 1MB evangelists will be clinging to a now defunct altcoin. 


This is a *major* change.  How do you propose to handle such a fundamental shift?  This will be much harder to implement than simply increasing the blocksize.  As I described, the proposed hard fork will only occur once a super-majority supports it.  This makes the fork transparent to the entire ecosystem.  This is a simple move forward and no one will know a thing about it.  Forcing users to use a separate transaction medium, then rely on bitocin as a settlement layer is orders of magnitude more complicated.  Please show me a well documented plan on how this is to occur.

The idea of cloud-mining is absurd.
Why would a company knowingly take money from you in exchange for mining power that can possibly make you a profit?
That's like a company selling the next $100 of their profit to you for $90.  It would be essentially giving away money.
The answer is that they aren't doing that.  They've worked out the numbers to ensure that they're selling you $90 of future profit for $100 (or maybe $99 for $100).
In the end, the only way to make money cloud-mining is if the price of bitcoin went up enough to cover the amount of money you're going to lose in mining.  But in that case, you'd make more if you just buy bitcoin and hodl it.

What if, what if, what if.  "What if" is exactly what guys like Peter Todd are relying on to keep us all thinking there's going to be a compromise while nothing gets implemented.


This is a fantasy.
You're essentially trying to describe the Lightning Network (LN), but you have it wrong.
The word "trustless" is thrown around a lot without anyone realizing exactly what it means.
Bitcoin is trustless.  I can send directly from me to you without trusting anyone.  Paypal is not trustless and they must process any funds sent from me to you.  Further they can deny the transaction, freeze my funds, and close my account.
LN is certainly better than Paypal, but it works much more like Paypal than a Bitcoin transaction in this regard.  No, hubs in LN cannot *steal* my funds, but let's be realistic, Paypal can't *steal* my funds either.
Hubs in LN can certainly deny my transaction though, just like Paypal.  And they can freeze my funds (though likely not as long as Paypal can get away with).
So what is LN but a network of lots of Paypals.  If one hub denies my transaction or freezes my funds, I can probably just use another hub as soon as my funds are available again.
But I don't call this system "trustless".  I still have to rely on hubs to process and facilitate my transaction.  This is a true sentence: "To send money on the lightning network, you no longer are p2p.  You must involve a third party to facilitate your transactions".  Involving 3rd parties has never been what bitcoin was about.
This isn't a solution to scaling bitcoin.  This is telling users, "don't use bitcoin, use something else".
I want *bitcoin* to scale.  I don't want to involve third parties in my bitcoin transactions.

This is why Gavin's proposal makes sense.  We increase the blocksize now so that bitcoin doesn't suffocate on the miniscule number of transactions it can handle, yet the regular Joe can still run a node with a shitty computer and a standard Comcast line. 
Then we grow the blocksize every other year to handle more and more volume all while bandwidth and storage gets cheaper and better.

There's nothing shameless about that.  First of all it varies wildly.  The fee is usually something like 2% plus a flat rate of 50 cents.  On low cost transactions, that fifty cents is huge.  I have a coworker that runs a dollar store and complains about this all the time.  People want to buy a $1 product, and he basically ends up giving it away for free.  This is why some stores put up a "minimum $10 on credit card purchases" type of thing, which is technically against their terms.
So maybe I should have said 2-50% fee.


Except that a lot of places that accept bitcoin offer a slight discount.  Honestly same goes for cash.  Just ask around.  But in my experience, most small businesses will absolutely give you a cash discount if you ask, especially on large purchases.

But I know that the 1MB limit is absurdly low.  The bitcoin network can barely process 5 transactions per second (tps).  Do you understand how pathetic that is compared to any other payment network?
This debate isn't about whether side chains will be needed or whether the lightning network will be profitable.  This debate is about whether to stick to 1MB, or let bitcoin grow to something useful.
What I fear the most is bitcoin adoption happening big time and the network is incapable of sustaining the volume.  That will be a complete failure.
Let side chains and LN come into play in a few years after bitcoin has grown more.  It's too soon.


I don't doubt that, and I believe that services like blockstream will be necessary in the future.  But they're corrupting core developers into protecting artificial limits too early and risking way too much to do it.

I've watch in-depth presentations by the active LN developers.
It's essentially a hub-and-spoke network of payment channels.
The hub would be a large entity, and the spokes would be individuals.  So for me to send a payment to you on LN, we'd go through a hub.  Using multisig, there would be no trust, but we still have to rely on a willing hub.
The idea for this would be that me and you can transact back and forth many times in a time period (like a month), then at the end of the month, broadcast a single tx to the blockchain to settle all of our trades during that time period.
I've seen nothing that shows that LN will decentralize payments any more.  And as far as censoring goes, it's a lot easier to shut down a large "hub" than a p2p system.

You said that "the network would be fine".  The network won't be fine.  It'll be completely saturated and it will be completely inaccessible by potentially millions of users that want to use it.
This is a terrible scenario.
Telling people "You're not important for a decentralized currency.  Just go use some trusted third party payment processor." Is essentially telling them to go use PayPal.
If this is your suggestion, then you don't understand what bitcoin is.  You see it as a competitor of Paypal, not a competitor of the Venezuelan Bolivar.
The important part of bitcoin is decentralization, not a fast payment network.  Telling people to rely on centralized trusted third parties is useless and insulting.  It defeats the purpose of bitcoin existing.

Second, raising the max blocksize doesn't create larger blocks.  Miners will still be incentivized to create small blocks (to propagate them first).  Raising the max blocksize only allows for the potential of larger blocks to grow naturally over the next couple years.

Those paid by Bitstream, yes.


How are your two statements related at all?
The core developers aren't bitcoin gods.  They're people.  They're influenced by the same things that influence most of us.  Money is definitely one of those things.
Having a single centralized code repository controlled by a few core developers (who are being paid by outside interests) is a terrible idea.  I welcome new forks and new ideas being developed.
There would be no drama if the blockstream team didn't fillibuster progress.  They stand to profit big time if transaction volume is significantly congested by the 1MB max block size limit.
They propose nothing real.  They talk about nominal and insignificant block size updates to pretend they want progress, but where is the code?
I am worried about the future of bitcoin if the max allowed blocksize isn't raised.  The measly transaction volume in place today is insufficient to handle anything real, beyond us fanboys buying some computer equipment on TigerDirect from time to time.
I proudly run an XT node, and I truly believe that core will lose this battle if they don't adopt a blocksize increase in the next 4-5 months.
I want to stick to Satoshi's vision.  He explained that the max blocksize would need to be raised, and even provided some pseudo-code to do it.  Gavin and Mike are adhering to his vision.

You said it wasn't artificial.  I pointed out that it most certainly is.
Also, I'm not saying it should be made unlimited.  But 1mb is a joke.  7tx/sec is pathetic by any standard.  Sure, there needs to be some limit.  But 1mb is most certainly not it.  No one knows what the answer is, and only time/testing will tell.  But if the 1mb limit is kept in place, bitcoin will be made irrelevant, and that's my biggest fear.

Once Schnorr and signature aggregation are both implemented on Bitcoin, won't CoinJoin txs be many orders of magnitude cheaper to do than non-CoinJoin txs?
If a CoinJoin tx has 40 participants, with signature aggregation, there is just one signature covering the entire tx, making the tx almost as small as just a standard solo tx (2 input/1 output).  But it has the benefit that the fee is split among all 40 participants.
Once this is in place, everyone will be highly financially incentivized to use a wallet with a CoinJoin implementation as their default eveyday wallet.  Is this correct?
@_date: 2015-08-18 12:22:27


Regardless of whether you think they are or not, they are.  Keeping the blocksize at 1MB will trigger a high fee market, as soon as blocks fill up.  This is true when the volume approaches any limit.


I'm not commenting on their motives at all.  I'm simply stating a fact.  Keeping the blocksize at an arbitrary 1MB limit, *will* absolutely create an artificial fee market.

I see a lot of popel using 2fa incorrectly (including myself)..  2fa has to include two separate means of authentication.  The device itself is 1 factor.  It's something you have.  The pin is another factor.  It's something you know.
Adding your phone into the mix isn't another factor.  It's still something you have.  If someone beats you up and takes you ledger, they're going to take your phone too.. That doesn't increase your security.
An infected computer can grab your pin, and a punch to the head can grab your ledger and phone.  This is a real secuirty risk.

Which is why I support merging BIP102 into core.  I'm not a BIP101 or GTFO guy.  In fact, all I'm looking for is a temporary measure to take place.  This isn't the end of the debate, even if BIP101 is implimented.  Bitcoin will be hard forked in the future for many things, included further blocksize changes.
Honestly, I don't particularly even like BIP101's increase schedule.  It's aggressive.  BIP102 is pretty small, but it's something.  I would personally like Sipa's proposal if it had an initial jump to 4MB in January 2016.  But waiting until 2021 just to hit 2MB is absurd.
I understand the need for fees in the system, but it's just unnecessary now with extremely high block rewards.  Even at the next reward halving, at current prices, we're talking $3500 rewarded to miners every ten minutes.  There's no need to force an arbitrarily high fee market on people when the problem can be alleviated with a larger block.  It just doesn't make any sense.

A fork is a fork.  There are benefits and detriments to both, but soft forks are not "less risky" in any way.
A soft fork potentially alienates older nodes, making them *think* they're correct and vulnerable to attack.  A hard fork at least lets older nodes know there has been an update and a forked chain.

That's simply false.  There is a cost to every transaction.  The longer they want this attack to go on for, the more costly it's going to be.
A larger max blocksize would increase the cost to get the same effect as it would today.  Sure, in an alternate universe where the max blocksize was even 2mb, an attacker could spend the same exact amount of money as he is now to perform an attack, but that attack would be half as strong.  The UTXOs would get cleaned up twice as fast, and there would be more transaction "bandwidth" to allow legitimate transactions to go through during the attack.

Technically, I could download the python source code and run it, but that's a pain in the ass to do every time I boot into Tails, not to mention it won't give me Trezor support.
To get Trezor functionality with Electrum, additional libraries are required.
Additionally, Tails doesn't have a root account set up by default for security purposes.  So to install anything, including these libraries (or even a newer version of Electrum), you'd need to give yourself root access, which could expose you.
All of this is a ridiculous process to go through every time I want to use a Trezor..
I really just wish someone would package the Electrum 2.4 binary with Tails instead of version 1.9.8..

I have a feeling that at the next difficulty adjustment, they are going to do another attack.
Now that BCH difficulty adjusts very quickly, I believe they're going to move all their hashpower to BCH right after bitcoin's next adjustment.
That will maximize the effect. They will couple this spam on the Bitcoin chain and pumping BCH on exchanges.

If a significant percentage of miners want to start downloading the core source code, modifying it to create an attack, then compiling it and running their custom "attack-coin" nodes, we're in a lot more trouble than a blocksize debate.

For the millionth time; sidechains and the Lightning Network (LN) isn't scaling bitcoin.  It's telling people to use another medium of exchange.  There's a difference.  Stop pretending that the LN is bitcoin.  It isn't.  It's a layer built on top of bitcoin.
The LN might be trustless.  It might be instant.  It might be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Most of us (including myself) will probably use it in the future.  But it's not a replacement for increasing the blocksize.  It's not scaling.  It's an alternative.


How is this relevant to anything?  I don't support all the changes in BitcoinXT.
I understand that a scaling debate was taking place before XT.  I don't doubt that.  But the announcement of XT (v 0.11) shined light significantly on the topic.  It pushed the conversation to the front of the list and basically made it a top priority for everyone.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:33:14


But the difference between us is that I'm not shilling for a corporation.  I'm shilling for a decentralized future.  I'm shilling for open-source software.  I don't make any money if BitcoinXT becomes the new "core".  Blockstream's profits will go up if the core devs can force artificially low blocksizes on us.


The only reason this has to be done this way is because it's not a consensus among developers.  Gavin is doing this to protect *against* a messy hard fork.  If Gavin implemented this without a super majoirty consensus and without it being in core, it would be disastrous and most likely fail.  He has to ensure XT has a super-majority before any changes are made, only because of the core devs who refuse to think ahead.
If the core devs all agreed to just raise it to 5mb next year, they could have included the patch in builds starting months ago.  We'd all be running with that patch right now.  Version 0.9 could have had it.  Version 0.10 could have had it.  Version 0.11 could have had it.  Even though the fork wouldn't have been planned until say June 2016, we could have all had the patch in our nodes from a year ago.
Is that even a fork then?  When &gt;99.99% of all nodes already agreed to the patch 2 years before anything goes into effect?  There would be no fork.  All nodes would just immediately start accepting bigger blocks simultaneously when the coded blockheight was reached.
This could have been done transparently.  No one would have noticed a thing.  There would have been no disruption to anything.  Just business as usual.

You didn't refute my point.
Raising the blocksize raises the allowed transaction volume (the fact that it's arbitrarily and artificially limited in the first place is asinine).  In a scenario where the max blocksize was doubled, an attacker would need double the money to have the same effect on the network for the same period of time.
So it would immediately increase the cost of conducting these attacks.

1MB blocks are not pushing maximum bandwidth limits today.  So why would we start at 1MB?

But their decision will be driven by market adoption.  If the BitcoinXT chain represents 80% of the market, what's going to give them more profit?
The larger the XT population gets, the easier it will be to convince processors/exchanges to switch.
Thankfully, Gavin/Mike thought this out, and if they never receive the 75% consensus they're looking for, no change is implemented at all.
So really, there's no downside to running XT, even for the processors and exchanges.  They are at risk of losing significant amounts of wealth if they try to stick to core after a 75% XT super-majorty is reached.

The hardfork needs a majority to occur, but this is explaining whether that's coded into the proposal.
A simple 50% majority will create a fork.  But that's not desirable.  BIP100 and BIP101 have a much more secure safety feature coded it.  The code ensures there is a super majority (75% or 90%) miner support held for a specific length of time before any change is actually implemented.
This is *much* safer, and ensures that there will either be a significant consensus or not hard fork at all.
BIP102 and BIP103 are much more dangerous, and potentially create a scenario where miner power is split roughly 50/50, causing confusing and lots of lost coins once it's resolved.

Just as an observation, this comment of yours displays signs of cognitive dissonance.  You were presented with a logical breakdown of why drug possession laws negatively impact society, but you've believed your whole life that these laws are necessary.  This contradiction is not psychologically comfortable.  So you've thrown logic out the window, and are running on pure emotion.  You're getting visibly upset and angry, littering your comment with curses.  I'm not faulting you for this, it's a completely natural human reaction.


Caused by the fact that it's illegal.  When you need money to get your fix, but can't get a job because you have a prior conviction, what are your options?  Theft becomes the quickest and easiest choice for them.


I'm not trying to justify violent, reckless behavior.  Individuals should always be held accountable for this.  If they start initiating violence or aggression against others then they need to be faced with the consequences of that violence, which could include prison, restitution, or whatever else society deems reasonable.


I didn't say that jail was the worst outcome.  But it is something real to think about.  Why should a person's life be ruined by a felony conviction if they hurt no one?  Why should a peaceful drug user be locked in a cage?  There are no logical answers to these questions.

I disagree with your opinion here.  I think there was a lot of confusion with 2x coming out, and companies were dedicating engineering efforts to support that fork, plus the Cash fork, and possible even the Gold fork.

This doesn't mean you won't get coins on the other chain. It simply means that it will be harder to split them.

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:00:32
Because this service is something that *everyone* wants.  Competition is rampant in industries where demand is that high, and there are little to no entry barriers.  Additionally, there's no specific skill or knowledge that one company would have over others.  Almost anyone in decent shape can be trained to perform the job.  
When virtually everyone in society would be willing to pay, and any physically fit person can be trained to do the job, that creates an almost infinite ability to compete.  I'd expect a thriving competitive market.
Think about the state of competition in various markets today.  The only monopolies (and oligopolies) are either provided by the government (police/fire/education), or are strictly enforced/regulated *by* the government (healthcare/telecom/utilities).  Think about things that everyone needs, and anyone can be trained to do (clothing, food, housing).  There is near infinite suppliers and choices available at every price level almost everywhere on the planet.

The word "privatizing" can have different meanings in this regard.  The situation you described is a monopsony; 1 buyer, many options to buy from.  The buyer is the government, and they contract out the exact services that they want, which results in a terrible situation (our atrocious prison system).  They are simply looking to outsource to a company that can do it cheaper.
This is not what I advocate at all.
What you're describing would be that the government contracts out police service to, say, Koch brothers inc (another example of a monopsony).  Now Koch Brothers has the monopoly of police protection in a given area.  Again, *not* what I advocate at all.
What I advocate is no government providing this service.  Each individual picks the company they want to protect them.  When you buy a house today, you have to shop around for an insurance agency.  You look at things like level of protection, price, service limits, etc.  There are lots of options, and you can compare and contrast their strengths and weaknesses.
This is what I advocate.  A private market full of rights enforcement agencies.  They can compete on their coverage and price.  For instance, ABC agency can show their average response time to a call is under 5 minutes, but their yearly premiums may be $800, vs Acme agency who's a little cheaper, but their average response time is around 11 minutes.
The media or agencies like Consumer Reports can conduct audits and reviews of different agencies to give people good knowledge of these agencies, their service and their prices.
This seems much better than the monopoly police force we have today, who routinely murder people with complete impunity.

Obviously.. However, nodes are important for decentralization, but are irrelevant if they don't agree with miners.  So their vote is not important.  They will follow the miners or be forked into irrelevancy.

Increase tx capacity. Signatures from segwit txs are discounted so we can fit more of them into a block.  The more segwit txs, the more txs can be confirmed every time a block is found.

Today, we have surpassed 300k txs per day.  Fees are 17 cents per tx on average.
Holy fuck.  Segwit did a better job at lowering fees than I could have even imagined.

This is the part I don't agree with.
There has been no attempt at compromise.  It's not a "conservative" approach.  It's been an outright rejection of any blocksize increase.
Where are the actual proposals?
Sipa's proposal doesn't even have a BIP number, and it's absurd (waiting 6+ years before even getting to 2mb??).  That's a joke.  Regardless, there's no code.  Gavin has been trying to discuss this for months, if not years.  Where are the options?  I'm done pussy-footing around, pretending that really smart people are debating this behind the scenes.  They're not.
I support BIP101 because it's the *only* option on the table.  I've said this since day one.  If some sort of compromise is made, and core implements a new BIP that has an initial bump, plus a growth rate, I will support that.  If not, I'll support BIP101.

@_date: 2015-07-29 22:08:47
Because you're just looking at *one* transaction.  This attack is much more than one transaction.
As I said earlier.  Each transaction has a cost associated.  To conduct an attack like this, you need many, many transactions (each with many outputs).
Currently, to make this attack somewhat successful, you need to flood the network with transactions (again, each at a cost).  This forces regular people to either wait until the attack is over to get their transaction through, or to raise their fee to get their transaction through.  The longer an attacker wants to keep this up, the more costly it will be for him, since he needs to continuously flood the network.
If the number of allowable transactions per second doubled (max block size of just 2mb), an attack of this size could get eaten up twice as fast by miners.  Same number of transactions, but double the transaction volume.  So in order for an attacker to keep up an attack, it would cost him twice as much.
Now, raise the max allowable blocksize to 8mb, and the attack costs 8 times as much to keep it going for the same amount of time.

@_date: 2015-07-29 18:21:09
Considering that the device creates the transaction and signs it, there is no risk of it being manipulated by an infected computer.
If a malicious computer tried to modify the transaction, the signature would no longer be valid.  Without the private key, a new signature could not be generated.
However, from a security point of view, I still believe Trezor is better since it rearranges the digits on the display when prompting you to enter your pin.  There is no screen on the ledger.  So technically if you used your ledger on an infected computer which had video screen capture software running, then they stole your ledger, you would be vulnerable.  A Trezor would keep you safe in this scenario, since they still would not know your pin.
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:17:25
The problem is that when you spend, you reveal your public key. If the attacker is a miner, he can beat you into a block.
He sees your tx, which reveals your public key, and he works to generate the private key. Then when he does, he constructs and signs a new tx that pays him instead.
He then puts his tx in the next block instead of yours. Your tx will fail for trying to double spend.
The fix needs to be implemented before the QC is available.
But yea, other than that, I get your point. If we move to a QC resistant crypto scheme beforehand, lost coins will still be vulnerable.
Perhaps moving coins to the new scheme would be mandatory, and after the fork date, all "lost" coins would truly be stuck forever.

This argument is insane and adds nothing to the conversation.  We're talking about a real thing (drug addiction and what should be done about it).  You're trying to compare that to something that doesn't exist.  Just leave this alone, it's not strengthening your argument.


Your "gaurantee" ignores reality.  Look at what prohibition did in America.  In created gang violence in an industry where none existed.  That gang violence dissapeared once alcohol was made legal again.
Everything you're saying about heroin can be equally applied to alcohol.  Alcohol kills people, ruins lives, causes negative behavior, etc.  Yet we acknowledge that peaceful people should be free to consume alcohol responsibly, and we only punish the people whose abuse leads to violent aggressive behavior.  I'm simply suggesting the same thing for all substances.  This is what you're refusing to acknowledge.


No matter what I say here, it's irrelevant.  I have nothing to prove, and this doesn't change my argument.  I can just as easily say I have 35 children or none at all.  I intentionally stopped talking about it because I didn't want to expand any information that might be used to identify me.


I personally know someone in this scenario.  A good friend of mine was an addict in his late teens (years ago).  He never hurt a fly.  He was never convicted or even accused of anything violent.  He eventually got arrested for distribution (which was complete bullshit, he simply had multiple bags on him).  He got convicted of a felony.  He served years of jail time.  He's now out of prison and has since recovered.  He cannot get a job anywhere because of his felony status.  His life was fucked by the state, and he never did a thing to hurt anyone.

Getting your tx in a block is valuable.  The market determines rates.  The txs paying the most get in first.  Since this little price surge, there has also been a surge on txs on the network.

This is where your hypothetical question falls apart.  If sufficiently powerful quantum computers (that can generate a private key from a given public key) ever become available, the whole system is vulnerable.  There is no "recovering" "lost" Bitcoin.  It means any address that has ever spent bitcoin is vulnerable to theft, and the entire system can no longer be relied on.
If this ever comes close to being reality, Bitcoin would need to change to quantum resistant cryptography.

I'm not.  I'm saying that A's REA will act as a proxy for A, since A's REA and B's REA likely have dealt with each other hundreds or thousands of times in the past.  They want to both continue acting as profitable companies, so they will work with each other to continue being profitable in the future.  If A actually did scam B, and A's REA refuses to act as A's proxy because of this fact, B's REA will have an easy time carrying out judgement.


I explained this.  In this scenario, IGOT seems to have scammed OP.  IGOT has no incentive to see an arbitrator because they have OP's money.  They can't improve their position by seeing an arbitrator.
This is where OP's REA will contact IGOT and explain, "Here are the details of our situation.  You agreed to receive $300USD and pay out 1BTC to our client.  He sent you $300 on this date (shows proof).  You never paid out the 1BTC.  We request arbitration.  We want this to go smoothly.  Failure to comply with our arbitration request means you admit you scammed our client.  In this case, we'll send a few well armed guys over to your headquarters bright and early Monday morning to collect the $300 our client gave you, plus an additional $200 for our time."
IGOT will likely see that it's options are limited.  What's the cheapest solution out of this mess?  They can just pay out OP before his REA comes to collect.  That ends the matter.  They can agree to arbitration, which will likely result in OP getting his $300, since OP was scammed.  This is more costly and time consuming, so IGOT probably won't choose this.  Or IGOT can say "fuck you" to OP's REA, and hire some armed security guards to defend against OP's REA who plan on showing up bright and early Monday morning to collect.  This last option will likely be the most expensive, because hiring people to put their lives on the line is fucking expensive.
This scenario will likely play over many millions of times between lots and lots of people/companies all over the country.  Anytime a dispute happens.  This is why most people will just hire a REA in the first place, and let the REAs agree in advance to settle all disputes via arbitration.

Second, it's nothing but an idea.  Let's see some code.  If people want this to happen, then either get a consensus, and get this into the bitcoin core code, OR fork core and create a bitcoin-sipa node which people can run, similar to bitcoin-xt.

Yes, but the point is that when "spend your BTC to a new wallet address you control" that very same tx will be replayed on the 2x chain as well, and vice versa.  So both txs will end up in both mempools.
This tactic may work.  But it'll come down to chance.  It all depends on which txs get confirmed on each chain.  Just remember that both chains will know about both txs that were submitted.  There is a chance that the same tx is confirmed on both chains.
So this is like a trial and error way.  I think using RBF is a better option.

Second, they don't have their money tied up in armies.  You think they'd just materialize an army to fight anyone who tries to carry out a judgement against them?  Do you understand how expensive that would be?
Third, if they are constantly scamming people, and hiring mercenaries to fight back against the REAs that attempt to carry out legitimate judgements against them, who in the world is going to choose to buy their products?  Who would choose to be their customers?  They'd go bankrupt in a couple weeks.

@_date: 2015-08-11 19:01:30
First of all, *all* transactions on the network are going to be put into blocks and stored on your laptop regardless of what the max blocksize is.
If there are 10 million transactions over the course of a week, those 10 million transactions are going to be put on your laptop, regardless of whether they're quickly and efficiently included into 8mb blocks, or whether they take an extra 2 weeks to confirm and spaced out in 1MB blocks.
The data is the same size in the long run.  It's just how quickly do we want our transactions verified?  In minutes, days or weeks?


This makes a potential fork much easier to implement.  This was Satoshi's idea.  Phase it in so that by the time the consensus is reached, 99% of nodes have already been upgraded for months.

The XT code will end up creating a hard fork if a consensus is reached (75% of all mining power).  If a consensus is never reached, then nothing changes.
This is why running an XT node is the safest.  It will work either way, whether a consensus is reached or not.  If you are running the core code, you will be on an orphaned chain if a consensus is reached.

So then you do have the entire blockchain on your computer.
You don't hae to run a node to use bitcoin.  You can get a wallet app like Electrum (PC), MyCellium (Android), or BreadWallet (iPhone).
Running a full node helps decentralize the network though, so there are benefits.
Raising the max block size won't necessarily increase your disk usage.  Every transaction will eventually be "logged" to your computer if you're running a node.  Whether those transaction are grouped into 8MB blocks or 1MB blocks is irrelevant.

My problem with reddit communists is that they ultimately just support a strong state to organize it all.  This is reminiscent of the USSR, North Korea, or Venezuela.  Centrally planned economies are corrupt, inefficient, and violent.
I'd be much happier with anarcho-communism, or anarcho-syndacalism, however, I'm skeptical that these can exist.  It seems to me that you'd need 100% voluntary participation for these systems to operate as anticipated.  You're never going to have 100% voluntary participation in any system or society of size.

I judge ideas on merit too.  And I've explained how arbitrary artificial limits are ludicrous in my eyes.  Do you understand how small 7 transactions per second is?  It would take over a year to process just 1 transaction from every citizen in the US.  Is that what you want?  How is this a sustainable system?  What's the point of bitcoin if it's just a silly toy that obviously cannot handle even a laughably small set of transactions?
I know what bitcoin is capable of.  And I know how it will die.  From being made irrelevant.  I want bitcoin to succeed, and creating artificial limits will ensure that doesn't happen.


At this point, I advocate BIP 101.  I'd be open to other suggestions, but this is the best on the table right now.


Who said an unlimited blocksize?  I just want breathing room.


And anyone will still be able to run a node with an 8mb max blocksize.  Also remember that max blocksize doesn't mean every block will be that size.
The growth after 8mb blocks will take place as technology gets better.
You entire concern has been taken into consideration with BIP 101.  Blocks are small enough to to be handled by anyone, yet it allows 8 times as many transactions per second, and the growth rate will be small enough so that technology will be on par, ensuring anyone can run a node in the future too.

Please tyrants!  Please stop allowing bitcoin to flourish!  You should just let the Blockstream team protect artificial transaction limits so they can illegitimately profit!! Please stop you horrible tyrants! /s
I'm supporting the code that aligns with my values.
Bitcoin isn't just supposed to be a settlement network for large entities to use.  Bitcoin is for the people.
While I think blockstream has some interesting features, I don't want their team artificially constraining bitcoin so they can potentially get more business.


Agreed, but it doesn't make what I said untrue.


Well, in all likelihood, the 2 weeks will be much longer since it will occue well before January (my prediction).  So everyone will likely know what's going to happen well in advance.  If you *choose* to be on the losing side when January approaches, that's on you.  If I ran a pool and I can see that the consensus was &gt;75% and was maintained for at least the last 2 weeks and January was approaching, I'd schedule a switch to XT asap.  This can be done anytime between now and then.

Are you intentionally not understanding my comments?  I said there is no violence that is *inherent* to the production of the drug.  Meaning, it's very possible to make heroin without hurting people.  I then *acknowledged* the violence in the industry and attributed it directly to the fact that it's illegal.  You are being intentionally dense.
When a product is made illegal, violent gangs take over production.  When something is legal, the violent gangs go away because that violence adds costs to the product.  They cannot compete with a legal industry.  It's not rocket science here.  We have a perfect historical case with the prohibition of alcohol.  Violent smugglers/bootleggers/moonshiners were create by prohibition, and were gone when alcohol was made legal again.  You're choosing to ignore history.

I would argue that's what happens today.  Since there's a monopoly, there's only one entity to lobby/pay off.  The rich are treated much differently than the poor, since they own the legislators who create the terms that the courts adhere to.  This is obvious.
Without a monopoly, private arbitrators known to accept bribes wouldn't last.  Their competitors would get their business.  They would fall to the wrath of a free market.
Look at today.  Many companies rely on private arbitration services for routine disputes.  They agree in advance to abide by rulings.  If either break their agreement, no one else will ever do business with them.  Additionally, if an arbitrator is known to accept bribes, businesses will refuse to conduct business with them, causing that arbitrator to go bankrupt.
I'm not saying people won't *try* to bribe arbitrators, or that some arbitrators won't accept a bribe, but the idea is that without a monopoly, the market will correct this problem.

Every tx contains inputs and outputs. Inputs point to previous txs that were sent to you. Outputs point to the addresses that you are sending to.
A tx can contain 1 input and 1 output, or many inputs and many outputs. 
Example: Someone sends you 1 BTC today. Tomorrow you need to pay rent for 0.1 BTC.  Your tx would likely be 1 input and 2 outputs. The input would point to the 1 BTC that you got yesterday. Your 2 outputs would be your 0.1 BTC for rent, and 0.9 BTC back to yourself as change.  This is a standard 1 input / 2 output tx.
Next if you pay your car payment, your input would be the 0.9 that you sent back to yourself, and your outputs would be 0.2 BTC car payment, and 0.7 back to yourself again.
Next if you pay your student loan payment, your input would be the 0.7 that you sent back to yourself, and your outputs would be 0.2 BTC student loan payment, and 0.5 back to yourself again.
You just made 3 txs, 0.1 rent, 0.2 car, and 0.2 student loans. 
However, you could have rolled all that up into 1 tx. Your input would be the 1 BTC that was sent to you. Your outputs would be 0.1 rent, 0.2 car, 0.2 student loans, and 0.5 BTC back to yourself. 
The exact same economic activity can be represented by 3 separate txs that pay 1 person each, or 1 single tx that pays 3 people. 
The big block you witnessed likely contained a few very large segwit txs that contained either many inputs or many outputs. One single tx could have represented a lot of economic activity. So i was simply saying that tx count is meaningless.

Warning, this will be a long answer.  If you want a summary of what I'm going to describe, check out these links:
David Friedman's book, [the Machinery of Freedom](  Here's a short [animated video]( giving the gist of his argument.
First of all, private courts for criminal trials need to go hand in hand with private police (rights enforcement agencies).  You can't have one without the other.  So the solution I'm going to describe involves a scenario where there is no government, no police, and no courts (as we know them today).
Let's just look at what would happen today.  OP calls the cops, they (maybe) investigate, and the case gets settled in court.  This is the best case scenario.  A lot can go wrong, and OP may never see his bitcoin again. 
Now, in a free society (no government), if A and B (IGOT and OP, respectively) can't agree on an arbitrator, or one simply refuses (in the case where A scams B and has no incentive to agree to arbitration), this is where B's rights enforcement agency (REA) comes into play.
B calls his REA (likely a large organization with many resources), and explains the situation.  He was scammed and wants his money back.  His REA has two options.  They can simply bust down the doors of IGOT and take either cash, bitcoin or property equal to B's claims plus a little extra for their time and service.  However, I don't see this playing out, because IGOT likely would have security or a REA of their own, and this would lead to a lot of violence which is very costly.
Likely A's REA and B's REA already know of each other.  Think Progressive Insurance and GEICO.  They both already know of each other, and know that they might have to have disputes settled because they're both in the same line of work, and they know at some point their customers will have a dispute.
These two agencies likely already have an agreement to settle disputes by a particular arbitrator.  In this case, A's REA might not actually want to go through arbitration because they can see that their client (IGOT) did indeed scam OP.  They may claim that since IGOT operated outside of their contract, they have no business protecting IGOT when OP's REA comes to collect the missing money.  This will likely be the cheapest option (and it will all come down to price, since they're for-profit companies).  However, if IGOT wants to claim that it operated normally, and didn't steal anything, IGOT's REA will agree to arbitration.
Once the arbitrator decides, it will be up to the winning parties REA to carry out the judgement.  IGOT's REA will agree to not stop OP's REA when they come to collect.

It's clear you don't understand how bitcoin works at all. 
The size of a single transaction is not dependant on block sizes. You're confusing the two things.

Well we're rapidly approaching the max blocksize limit.  You can't rely on fantasy overlay networks to solve real world issues.  There will be congestion.  There will be super-long confirmation times.  There will be lots of "I sent a bitcoin 2 days ago.  Why is it taking so long?  Bitcoin sucks!" posts all over the internet.


So your solution is to rely on centralization and trusted third parties with a "Know Your Customer" policy to hold your private keys?  This is fucking absurd man.  This is everything that bitcoin originally sought to fix.


There is if the merchant wants confirmation of my payment and we both don't want to trust a third party.  This is what bitcoin is.  This is what bitcoin has always been.
Ultimately, what you're suggesting is for people to *not* use bitcoin.  When you boil it down, that's your solution.  In reality, this isn't a solution.  This is just suggesting an alternative.
I want to use bitcoin, so I'll continue to support bitcoin.  You can continue to tell people to not use bitcoin and instead promote whatever bullshit centralized third party crap you're peddling.

Yea, I didn't get that reference.. However, Robocop was still about a monopoly running things.  I agree.  Monopolies are bad.  That's what we have today.  I'm advocating the opposite of that.


I started as a libertarian.  I guess you can say a [minarchist](  I thought we needed government for a few things at least.
But I just started pushing the envelope.  If we agree that the government should not be making shoes, and we agree that this will be better handled by a competitive market of private companies, then why stop there?  We agree that governments should not be manufacturing cars, or writing operating systems, or running restaurants, why not take that theory further.
I think the only thing people have a problem with envisioning, is how police and courts would work.  Why would anyone follow the orders of a private court?  How would police forces work?  For that, I think David Friedman gives the best example in his book, [the Machinery of Freedom](  Here's a short [animated video]( giving the gist of his argument.
In the end though, I would still be happy with a much more libertarian society, even with a state.  I'm not a "don't ever vote" anarchist.  Yes, I advocate a completely stateless society, but I'm not opposed to trying to reduce the scope and power of government in our communities and states.

In the situation I'm describing, people would be protected not by police but by a rights enforcement agency.  In the end, they will carry out the judgement.
And I'll be clear.  In the event where IGOT refuses arbitration, and legitimately tries to scam me, my rights enforcement agency will be happy to explain to them that if they refuse my arbitration request, they plan on coming to their headquarters with a few well armed guys and take back my stolen property for me, plus a little extra for their time and resources.

Nice analysis.   I had a couple small thoughts to add..


The top comment on the link you referenced criticized that 3.7mb block for having a low number of txs.
The reality is that regardless of how many txs a block like that contained, 3.7mbs worth of txs would have previously required 4 blocks to process, and can now be done in just one, because of segwit.
I think people get too hung up on the number of txs.  The economic activity that they represent is just as important.  1 tx can represent a single payment being made to a merchant, or it could represent 100 withdrawals from an exchange.  One of those two txs represents 100x the economic activity as the other.  However, in a tx/sec metric they both look the same.
We may not see a huge increase in the tx/sec metric, but the level today represents much more economic activity than the same level from a few years ago.  That's not as sexy, but it means that Bitcoin is becoming much more efficient over time.

The exact opposite.  Everyone is accountable for their actions unlike today.  In the system I've described, no one will be free to murder in the name of the state and get away with it.  Officers kill over 1000 people a year in the US, all in the name of the state, hiding under the phrase "Protect and Serve".  There is little to no accountability for the state (or their agents)'s actions in today's society.
I want everyone to be held accountable.

The question is not whether Electrum is ready *now*.  The earliest this increase could even be implemented is January 2016.  But it requires a minimum of a two week 75% consensus, so more realistically, it would be at least a year from now.

If I have some bitcoin in cold storage, do I have any reason to worry about two chains becoming a reality?  Can I just hodl until the storm passes, or am I at risk of losing if I don't spend them on both chains?

Not sure, but in all honesty, there's no need. Until a government bans the transmitting of bitcoin transaction messages, no one will really rush to add an extra layer of encoding to the process.

First of all, this really only affects brick and mortar merchants. You don't see it, but online merchants aren't shipping you anything until your transactions are confirmed and included in a block.
It's unrealistic that a brick and mortar merchant would actually say "We don't accept *any* RBF flagged transactions."  It's more realistic that a policy would be "If you choose to send us an RBF flagged transaction, we reserve the right to wait until the transaction is included in a block before accepting it."  Which is very reasonable.
In the rare scenario where a spender knowingly chooses to send an RBF flagged tx to a merchant who says they will not accept RBF transactions until confirmed, but then refuses to wait for his transaction to be included in a block, he can simply issue himself a refund by using RBF.  Then he leaves the store without completing a purchase.  However, he always has the option to just wait.  If you think it's inconvenient to wait, then don't fucking use RBF transactions.
Remember, no one is forced to use RBF flagged transactions, and no one is forced to accept it.
Now, if the merchant explicitly says, "NO RBF TRANSACTIONS AT ALL!!" and you still send them one anyway, you still have the option to reverse it by issuing yourself a refund with a higher fee.
I really can't see a single situation where this will cause a problem.  Can you describe such a scenario?

The reason bitcoin isn't a democracy is that you can choose any consensus rules you want.  However, there is an economic incentive to use the same consensus rules as the majority.
The hard fork is a tool to take power away from a single source of authority.
I sometimes get a little worried that the majority of high profile core developers and committers work for a single company, but I don't believe the conspiracy that they're trying to sabatoge bitcoin for their own personal gain.  If anything, they seem to need a strong bitcoin for their business model to be profitable.
However, if in the future, a malicious entity did that, I'm glad that a fork is an option.
At this point, I just want to see SegWit deployed safely and cleanly.  I want to see the wallet makers start generating SegWit txs by default, and I want to see the increased throughput that it brings us.

If there is consensus, that is simply the evolution of bitcoin.  You can't push changes that no one wants.
It's more than just miners too.  Miners won't switch protocol rules if there is no economic incentive.  They need exchanges to switch also.  Exchanges won't switch if there is no user support.  So users need to want to switch too.
It's a delicate ecosystem.  There is no such thing as "hikacking" in a consensus algorithm.  Consensus rules evolve, and everyone has a choice as to which rules they support.  There is an economic incentive to support the same consensus rules that the majority of the ecosystem supports, but there is no requirement to do so.

All miners will build on the longest valid chain.  So while they would see this block as valid, the segwit chain will see it as invalid and orphan it.

This isn't a problem at all.

But if you own coins before a fork, any transactions you make after the fork will be valid on both chains.  I've already thought of this.  To discourage this behavior, anyone can write a simple little python script that broadcasts transactions from one chain to the other and vice versa.

If you spend coins on one chain, expect that tx to be broadcast to the other chain as well.

Guns don't commit murder.  Criminals commit murder.  You do realize that murder existed before guns, right?  Do you have any statistics that link guns to higher murder?  I know that in NYC, it's an extremely expensive and complicated process to get pistols and on top of that, carrying pistols is illegal except for an elite few, yet NYC has an extremely high murder rate.  Meanwhile Houston, TX makes it much easier to buy guns and lets almost all people carry them concealed as well.  Their murder rate is much lower.
Also, in [Switzerland]( guns are required for all able bodied males.  You have to have an assault rife and a pistol in your home by law.  The murder rate out there is extremely low.  I'm not saying that more guns = less crime, what I am saying is that your claim that the existence of guns leading to more crime is just stupid, illogical and based totally on your insecure emotions.

Alice wants to get rid of her Litecoin, but needs to pay Bob, who only accepts Bitcoin.
They can route through Charlie, who runs a hybrid Bitcoin/Litecoin LN node, and can perform the atomic swap for them trustlessly.
So the route goes: Alice's Litecoin gets swapped into Bitcoin at Charlie's node, who forwards Bitcoin to Bob, all done atomically and trustlessly.

I think you responded to the wrong comment.  But I think I know what you're referring to.
In another comment I said that once we have &gt;50% of the mining power, we can mimic 95%.  Which I assume this is what you're saying is "incorrect".  You proposed a UASF at that point.
A UASF is a mimic of 95%, by orphaning blocks that do not signal segwit.  That's my point.  So all nodes and miners will see segwit as 100% and activate based on the BIP9 rules.
We're saying the same thing.

You don't understand how a fork will play out.
First of all, the likelyhood of it being split 50-50 is rare, since at least 75% support is needed before the fork will even potentially happen.
75% or more support for one chain will decimate the other chain's chances of surviving.  Miners will not mine on a chain they cannot be profitable with.
Last, there isn't "classic coins" vs "core coins".  Anything that exists before the fork will be a valid transaction after the fork.  So if you sell coins on the "classic fork", that tx will likely be broadcast to both forks and included in both chains.
Everyone seems to think the fork will create two separate ecosystems.  That's not how this works at all.

What does this even mean?  A self governing system?  They absolutely are not doing that.  There are 3 or 4 of them who control what pull requests get merged.  There is nothing "self governing" about that.  As of right now, they control consensus rules, and they are fighting to keep that control.


I would agree that consensus algorithms are not democratic.  But consensus does still exist.  I'm not advocating a system where everyone gets to vote on what features get added next.
There are people who believe that blockstream is intentionally creating blockspace scarcity so that they can illegitimately profit by selling space on their side chains.  I assume you don't believe that.  So you see the large block advocates as attempting a hostile fork.
However, just for a second, assume they are right.  What would you say in that scenario?  What if some hard evidence, like leaked emails were revealed that showed blockstream employees conspiring to create this artificial block scarcity for profit, and paying off forum moderators, and trying to hire more influential core developers so they wouldn't have any opposition.
Would you be ok with another team of developers trying to gain consensus then?  What if it had nothing to do with blocksizes, but a different part of the consensus rules?
This is what I don't understand.  How do you think bitcoin is supposed to avoid attacks like the one I described (regardless of whether blockstream is trying this or not)?  How are we ever supposed to fork away from say a government infiltrating the development process?
What's happening here is how bitcoin was designed.  This is exactly how bitcoin was made to evolve.
For the record, I don't believe blockstream is doing anything malicious.  In fact, I routinely argue in favor of the core team on the alternate subreddits.  I simply like hearing the arguments from both sides.  I like to see what both sides have to say.

The better way to ask this question is, "Why are the core developers who *did* sign the HK agreement not following through?"
And the answer usually falls back to "Luke made a max block size increase proposal".  (Even though it's a max block size decrease until 2024.)
Then the follow up is, "Then why wasn't it implemented in core?" And the answer is, "because it was controversial."
Then the follow up is, "But segwit was also controversial, and that was implemented in core."
I've never seen the conversation go beyond this point.

The way it appears to me, he doesn't use covert asicboost on every block he mines.  It's the high frequency of his empty or near-empty blocks with the malleated coinbase text that are suspect.
It doesn't matter what I believe he will do.  The fact is that he can still use asicboost once segwit activates, by not mining segwit blocks.
This will likely be obvious if some of his blocks are segwit, filled with txs, and some aren't.  But it's pretty obvious today too.

If you want to be condescending, everything in bitcoin can be explaining as just a "neat tool".  It's a feature.  If you don't like it, don't use it.  But it can be very useful.


If a person decides it's not useful, then there's not point of it for *him*.  But "useful" is subjective.  Is a hammer useful to a teacher?  No.  Does mean hammers are useless?  Not at all.
Most users today don't use multisig either.  Is that just a useless "neat tool" too?  No.  All of these things have real use cases, and real meaning.  They will be valued differently by different people.  If you don't like multisig, then don't use it.  If you don't like RBF, then don't use it.

Ok, so let's keep going with this.
It's unknown how many people can fit in the club before the club looses appeal (decentralization).  The sign outside says "100 people only".  This creates a line out the door every night.  However, when the people go inside, it seems obvious to them that there is some extra room available.
Some argue to just change the sign to say "200 people only" to increase capacity.  But a simple change like that can only go so far.  There is a real capacity problem at this club that will eventually be reached at some point.  Changing the sign to "200" just kicks the can down the road.  It doesn't solve the looming capacity problem.
Some other people say, "Let's keep the sign at 100, which will keep a nice line out the door, but let's really set us up for long term capacity increases.  Let's start building a rooftop terrace bar (LN), hire extra bartenders and buy automatic ID scanners so people can get in and served much faster (libsecp256k1), and tell the bouncers not to count males against the 100 people limit as long as they're accompanied by a female (SegWit).  Now, we'll effectively have double the capacity, we'll be much more efficient, and set us up for long term scalability.  Then next year when this is all implemented, we'll change the sign to 200."
But the large sign people just scream, "No that's stupid!  Just change the sign!  That's smarter!! We don't care about more bartenders, ID scanners, and rooftop terrace bars!  Plus, we can't find females to accompany us! Just change the sign!"

You  don't seem to understand how this works.
They don't want an altcoin.  They're not trying to create an altcoin.  They have a vested interest in bitcoin.
Agree with them of not, they're simply attempting to use bitcoin's built in mechanism to change consensus rules.
If they succeed, then that means they have a wide consensus, from users to exchanges, from miners to nodes, and even merchants.  If they fail, that means they do not have consensus.  This is how bitcoin was designed.
I personally do not believe they have a chance at this point.  I want to wait for SegWit, and I'd rather have any future hard forks supported near-unanimously among developers.  Who knows what the future holds though.

I'm not assuming they don't want it to succeed, only that they will somehow profit from artificially limiting transaction volume.
The core devs standing firm behind the artificial limits are all associated with blocksteam.  I assume their funders have a plan and artificial transaction limits help them in some way.
Additionally, I think some miners want a "fee market", to make mining more profitable, so again, they're putting profit before the protocol.
Again though, what is your argument?  You haven't explained your side of things.  Please tell me know artificial limits will help bitcoin.  We're like 6 coments deep in this argument, and you haven't made a point yet.  Make your point!

That's simply a false dichotomy.  Jeff never proposed the 20mb or 8mb hard forks.  He simply did his technical analysis on the proposals out there by both sides, and tried to get them to compromise.
He has staked a little more in this 2mb proposal since it's really the lowest possible value that still constitutes an "increase".
This is coming from a guy who supports the scaling roadmap.  Look at my comment history.  I was going crazy yesterday disputing Blockstream conspiracies and defending Core.
It's just hard.  I don't want a contentious fork.  As much as I'd like to see a blocksize increase, I don't want Classic to successfully pull it off.  I feel like it will set back future bitcoin improvements and development for months or years to come.  I just wish Core budged a little.  Technically, a 2mb increase is pretty insignificant.  But coupled with SegWit, it'll really give us some scaling breathing for the next year or two while more solutions are developed.

In this regard, we definitely disagree.  This is open source software.  Anyone is allowed to fork a repo on github.  This isn't "taking over years of work".  Anyone who has worked on the code will always have credit.  Go look at the repo for bitcoin classic, it still lists all the developers who work on core.  No one is stealing anything or claiming credit for anything they didn't do.


I agree that they likely won't initiate a fork.  To get the miners on board, you need the whole ecosystem on board.  Miners won't switch without exchanges switching.  Exchanges won't switch without users, and users won't switch without merchants.
But "succeed" is subjective.  Perhaps the goal is just to get Core to include a future hard fork for a max blocksize increase.  In that regard, they might succeed.  Only time will tell.


As of today, again I agree.  But we are near capacity, and some fear that future adoption may stall without larger capacity increases.


I think some believe that the Blockstream corporation, who pays many big name Core developers, has a conflict of interest.  Some think the products they offer benefit from bitcoin being near capacity, since they offer off-chain solutions.
I have argued that Blockstream needs bitcoin to be strong to be profitable.  But there has been times where I have also questioned Blockstream's motives.  As of right now, I want Core's scaling roadmap, and I have no reason not to trust Core.  However I do believe that a future max blocksize increase will eventually be necessary.  1MB is arbitrary and too small.  It was never meant to be a long term limit.

In general, modern economists from the [Austrian school]( of thought advocate against fiat currencies (since they always collapse).  In their eyes, collapse of fiat currencies are inevitable and history proves them right.
In fact, the [average life expectancy]( of all fiat currencies that ever existed is only 27 years.  The Euro is only about 11 years old and it is on the brink of being split apart, re-tooled, or collapsing.  The USD (in its fiat form) is about 41 years old (since Nixon took us off the gold standard), so it's pushing its luck.
[Zero Hedge]( is also a pretty popular economic blog that has many contributors.  Most of their theories revolve around a collapse of the Euro leading to a collapse of the USD (and really all fiat currencies).

Yea, I would just spec out a motherboard with two PCI-E slots.  You should be able to put together a case, CPU, motherboard, and power supply for like $200 if nothing is top of the line..  I'm sure you've got an old hard drive laying around somewhere.. I would just make sure your power supply is going to be able to handle the power requirements of two overclocked 5770s.

These 12 people can't just make decisions for the litecoin community. If litecoiners reject it, then it won't happen. 
Same with bitcoin. Even if the top 6 miners equal 75% and they tried to push through bigger blocks via BU software, the bitcoin community would reject that chain. 
The reality is that the litecoin community wanted this change, and the litecoin miners simply agreed.

Business expand their potential offerings by using multisig.  Future businesses can do the same with RBF.
RBF can be used as a short term guaranteed refund policy in a payment channel for instance.  You just have to think outside of the box.  RBF is a tool just like multisig.  It will be interesting to see how the market makes use of this tool to expand bitcoin's capabilities.  In the meantime, if you don't like it, don't use it!

This is true in any monetary system.  Bad people exist; if you get scammed by one of these bad people, it's not the fault of the currency that's used.
That being said, it might seem more prevalent in bitcoin since bitcoin can be used with tor for a very anonymous experience.  If the scammers are anonymous they might be able to scam with more confidence.
The important thing to remember is to just be smart.  You don't have someone looking over you.  Don't fall for 7% weekly interest scams.
Bitcoin is just a currency.  It's not a bank, it's not a government, it's not anything more than a currency.  What people do with that currency is of no concern to the currency itself.

Running a 250 watt power supply at full power for a year at $0.15 per kwh costs $328.50.  Your power supply isn't running at full power, but without some gauges, it's hard to estimate what it is actually using.  Say 75% of max power (still probably not even that high).
250 (watts) * 24 (hours a day) * 365 (days in year) / 1000 (convert o kilowatts) * .15 (cost of kwh) = 328.5 * .75 (75% power usage) = $246.375 a year.  You can easily still make that much in bitcoin a year mining with GPUs.  Hell, people were still mining with these same GPUs when the price of a bitcoin was $3.

This is a shining example of why regulation is bad.  He exploited an ignorant population who just blindly assumed their money was safe because they've grown up in a world where a nanny state has raised them to be ignorant and entitled since birth.
If you were stupid enough to store your wealth with a anonymous website without any type of contract being signed, and without knowing the identity of all parties involved, then you are a fool.  This is true whether there is regulation or not.  He scammed ignorant people, plain and simple.
And if this turns out not to be a scam, then he taught a valuable lesson to the bitcoin community.  You don't have a mafia type agency (which you are forced to fund under the threat of imprisonment) watching your back.

You can optionally pay a transaction fee when you send bitcoin.  If you do, your transaction will be prioritized by the network.  If you don't, there is a chance that your transaction will take longer to be processed and there is no guarantee that it will be in the very next block.
Once block 209999 was mined, a lot of people must have purposely made a bitcoin transaction with a high transaction fee to give them a better chance of being part of historic block 210000.
The transaction fees go to the miner who mined that block.  It's a system to incentivize mining once there is no more mining reward, and also to prioritize important transactions.

I disagree with this statement.  In a world I imagine, there would be competing services.  Why would one become so massive and all powerful?  Did they provide something that was completely unable to be duplicated by any other services like that on Earth?  Most likely, there would be competing services that would keep each other in check.  Monopolies only occur when there is no competition.  There has never been a monopoly that arose from too much competition.  In fact, the existance of the state ensures that a monopoly (or oligopoly) will emerge.  Look at our wireless industry, banking industry, TV industry, internet industry.  Each one of those industries are granted privileges (regulations) that allow them to exist and make it close to impossible for new competitors to emerge.


UPS wouldn't exist as a shipping company if its business model included the theft of random $100 packages of vibrating dildos and other junk you may buy off of eBay.
Why do you ignore the basic principle that it's more profitable to provide a reputable service that is in demand, than it is to scam people by stealing their packages?  That alone would resolved 50% of your concerns.
I was recently on vacation at an island that was inhabited mainly by poor laborers.  There was plenty to do on the resort grounds, but my girlfriend and I wanted to go horseback riding and the resort did not offer that.  When we were picked up by the drivers of the private horseback riding company, the situation seemed a little sketchy and my significant other was getting a little worried.  I explained to her that this country's main industry is tourism.  If the reputation turned from a friendly country to a country filled with murderers and thieves, people would eventually stop going there and their economy would collapse.
I explained that it was much more profitable for these guys to actually provide a real horseback riding service, than it would be for them to pretend to provide a horseback riding service, then just rob you.  People would obviously learn this and stop booking horseback riding trips with this company.  We ended up having a fantastic and romantic time riding horses along the beach.
This is a basic premise that people seem to forget.  Yes of course UPS can steal your packages.  Yea, we could have been mugged by the drivers of a horseback riding company.  But those would be one-time gains.  In the long run, these two companies are much more profitable by providing reputable services.
I'm not saying that scams never happen, but a market will self regulate.  If you have the choice of shipping with UPS or Joe's shipping service, and Joe offered a cheaper rate, but you couldn't find any information about his company, would you choose Joe or UPS?  Probably UPS because of their reputation as a reputable shipping company.  However, over time Joe's service may become more and more popular, since they offer a cheaper service.  Over time, he could build his reputation and steal some business from UPS.  If UPS didn't innovate, they could potentially go bankrupt from not being able to keep up with Joe's level of service and his prices.
Bad companies will fail in a free market.  Untrustworthy services will die.  Only reputable companies that offer good services will exist in the long run.


First of all, there could very well be a private company to maintain codes.  If you higher an electrician, he can say, "I'm certified by the Professional Electrician's Board" or something similar.  This happens all the time in the tech world.  I get certifications from private companies that prove I know how to use a database, or code in Java, or deploy a virtualized computing environment.
We see this same thing in the movie industry.  The MPAA issues ratings for movie so people know what to expect.
My point is, to avoid a crappy electrician doing a crappy job that could end up hurting you, there could be electrical inspector services available.  You hire an electrician, he does a job, then you hire the electrical inspector to come down and review the work for $99 bucks and tell you whether or not it's up to socially acceptable standards.  You don't need a state for these things, and these things exist in other markets today as I've pointed out.
Also, if you decide not to hire an electrical inspector and your house does burn, that's why you have home owner's insurance.  Accidents happen.  People do die in fires today and there would still be fire accidents where people die.  I just believe that the world would be an overall safer and freer place if there wasn't the overwhelming violence, power, theft, and oppression of the state.


So what happens, new people take over the state and they won't be corrupt?  The state will always be corrupt because it is the state.  Is is a monopoly on violence.  It is the sole judge of morals.  It has to become corrupt because there is no other option.  All states will become corrupt.  I have come to accept that.  Look at the USA.  It was set up as the least restrictive state most of history.  It was given a short list of what it could so and was told "everything not listed here is reserved for the people".  What happened?  In just about 200 years it turned from the freest of all states to an extremely powerful and oppressive corrupt state.

2^160 = 1.4615x10^48
1.4615x10^48 / 100 Tillion = 1.4615x10^34
1.4615x10^34 / 60 (seconds) =  2.4358x10^32 Minutes
2.4358x10^32 / 60 (minutes) = 4.0597x10^30 Hours
4.0597x10^30 / 24 (hours) = 1.6916x10^29 Days

One major advantage of bitcoin as a currency is that it can be completely anonymous.  If you want to take out a loan from someone, the lender is going to want to know your identity to make sure they're going to get repaid.
If you want to remain anonymous, this doesn't seem legit, but if you're willing to give up personal information for a loan, this could end up being much easier than a loan at a conventional bank.  I do see a lot of potential here..

First off all, that answer varies wildly.  I always find it funny that people need to know how every single aspect of life would function in exact detail if the state didn't provide these services, but fail to ask those questions about today's world.
Do you know how pencils are made?  Can you duplicate that process?  No, but somehow, miraculously, pencils are made without the state!!  How is this possible?!?  Do you demand to know how pencils are made, or do you just accept that someone has an effective process for making pencils and it works?  If someone else came up with a better method, then there would be competition and the industry would evolve from innovation.
The same exact thing would happen in the this area.  Someone who has experience in that field would come up with a great method of enforcing contracts, and he would become a wealthy man for providing a profitable service that was very much in demand.  A competitor can offer a slightly modified version of that service and the two would compete for business.  This would expand since this, as you've pointed out, is a highly desirable service to have.  When there is a demand for a service, there will be service suppliers.  It is a basic law of economics.
I cannot tell you exactly how every single potential dispute resolution service would each handle the enforcement of their decisions.  Those types of questions cannot be answered by me, because I'm not in that business.


The best I can do is potentially offer some suggestions based on some educated assumptions.  Yes, private courts could potentially hire private security firms to enforce their decisions.  The private security firm industry would be much more efficient, much more moral, and much less susceptible to corruption than the state's monopoly today.  These firms would have to provide a reputable service, or they would fall wrath to the power of a free market.  No one would pay for a corrupt service when there are ethical, responsible alternatives that exist.


Can you not see that is how it works today?  You just described today's system.  Since there is only one dispute resolution service (the state), they do not have to compete.  In turn, they have simply become the enforcers for the wealthy.  Why do the wealthy rarely face jail time when they commit crimes?  Why is Jon Corzine and the other execs of MF Global not being held responsible for the [billion dollar theft]( they perpetrated?  Why are none of the bank CEOs help responsible for the financial collapse?  Because they own the monopoly known as the state.  Every fear you have about my suggestion of private dispute resolution services is actually reality today.  In my example, corruption would be much harder because of actual competition.

It's called market regulation.
In a libertarian society, if my local grocery store put up a sign that said, "no niggers allowed", I'd stop shopping there. Others would definitely join me. 
That doesn't make us a state. That makes us free people who can make decisions for ourselves.

The short answer is no, they don't really matter.
There is no voting in bitcoin.  Everyone can support the consensus rules they want.  If an even split happens, there will be two chains.  If a lopsided split happens, most will join the more powerful side.
The only thing that will cause a split is for miners to start creating blocks that adhere to different consensus rules than today.
This is what Classic is attempting, to create blocks that don't adhere to today's consensus rules.  I believe it will be close to impossible for them to successfully create 750/1000 blocks using an upgraded header version.

If you already have the computer, you can get an ATI 5770 for around $100..  That'll get you around 220MHash/sec if you overclock it and configure it right...

A cheap computer with an ATI 5770 is a good place to start.. Overclocked, you should be able to get 220 mhash/sec, based on my personal experience and this [mining guide](  The 5770 can be had for $99 bucks if you look hard enough.
You'll mine almost 5BTC a month (about $22 at today's trading value).  So it'll pay for itself in a few months.
If you get the ATI 5970, you can mine at about 800 mhash/sec, getting you about $80 a month at today's values.  That's going to run you like $800 though..
Use [this calculator]( to figure out how much you'll mine.

In today's world of fiat currency, every country is dependent on its ability to borrow.  The US, Britain, Australia, Euro countries, etc.  Every country needs a good line of credit and the ability to borrow at will to keep their spend/debt/tax collection cycle going.
If Greece exits the Euro, it will not pay back a dollar of its borrowed money.  This means people, countries and banks who invested in their bonds will not get paid.  This will increase the rate at which other Euro countries borrow at.
The minute these interest rates skyrocket for these countries, it limits their ability to pay the debt back, which limits their access to new credit.  As I said, if Greece fails or is kicked out, interest rates for countries in similar situations will skyrocket.  Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, and even France will have much higher rates to deal with and it will make the problems their even worse.
Spain will then probably be next, their failure or exit from the Euro will cause the problem to be even worse for the remaining Euro countries, and then Portugal or Ireland, etc.  They will fall like dominoes.  This could take years to all unfold, but I don't see a way around it.

That's just false.  It's mostly generous, kind people.  Every single day there are thousands of bitcoin exchanged back and forth in a very stable economy.  Products are bought and sold, labor is performed and business is conducted.  The existence of a scam here and there only effects a very small percentage of the bitcoin community.
Most people just keep their bitcoin in their wallet file, buy and sell good and have a great time.
I think you're missing the point that the only way to get scammed is to trust an online website with your money.  Don't do that and you'll never get scammed.  You can be very productive in the bitcoin world and never trust a single one of these sites.  They are optional.


No one's willing to accept that at all.  I'm not sure what you're talking about.  You're acting as if it's inevitable to get scammed which is ludicrous.

It's a currency.  Instead of having a tangible leather wallet holding dollar bills, you have a wallet file on your computer that contains digital coins.
You can spend them, send them to people, you can work for them, you can sell items for them, people can send them to you.  It's just like regular money.
What makes it popular is that it isn't controlled by any government, bank, corporation or person.  It's open source software and if used properly, it's completely anonymous.

Again, we're just not going to see eye to eye.  I do not advocate for any laws that punish actions that are inherently victimless.  Running a website is victimless.  An adult selling drugs to another adult, where both parties are willing participants, and enter in an agreement voluntarily, without any coercion, is inherently victimless.  You don't blame a liquor store owner if a guy buys a handle of vodka and drinks himself to death.  Yet you seem to not only blame the drug dealer for his clients' deaths, but you blame the guy running a website that a drug dealer uses to sell drugs.  Pure insanity.  I will caveat that and say that if a drug dealer "spikes" heroin with fentanyl without telling his clients, that is inherently violent and creates victims.  That is not the scenario I'm defending, and that drug dealer should be held responsible for his actions.


Speak for yourself.  The only difference between "trafficking" and "importing" is legal status. There's nothing bad about importing goods that society wants. Last century people who imported alcohol were considered dangerous "traffickers" too, and you probably would have advocated throwing them in jail.  But today, they are peaceful, productive members of society.  I'd like to stop throwing people in prison and maybe we ca have a more peaceful society that doesn't advocate violence against people so frivolously.


That's an utterly absurd comparison.  With the website example there are no victims.  He just didn't coerce anyone.  He didn't trick anyone.  He didn't hurt anyone.  He just wrote code and clicked a mouse.  With your murder example, he physically murdered another person.  This comparison is ludicrous.

Yes, the 51% attack is always possible.  But it's much harder on Bitcoin, and the incentive is much lower.  To successfully pull off this attack on Bcash, any one of about 5 different miners can do it single handedly.  To pull this attack off on Bitcoin, you'd need collusion between 3, maybe even 4 specific mining pools.
Also, by doing this to Bcash, they don't kill their revenue stream.  They go back to happily mining Bitcoin once it's over.  But by doing to Bitcoin, they kill their current revenue stream, which is much higher than what they would make doing the attack.
So in terms of profiting, it makes no sense to do it to Bitcoin.  They would lose money in the long run.  So there is no financial incentive.  But doing it to Bcash is pure profit, since killing that coin does nothing to affect their existing revenue model.

And they're not even measuring Bitcoin blocks correctly.  Looks like they're only counting the non-segwit portion of the block, which can be 1mb max.  In reality, since we now have segwit, Bitcoin blocks are routinely [1.2mb - 1.5mb]( sometimes even hitting 1.7mb.

No.  This changes so many other properties of Bitcoin, including the inflation rate, and security assumptions.  The base layer should remain predictable.

The reality is that it can vary.  If they're all 1 input/1 output bech32 txs, we can probably hit 15 tps, maybe even higher.
If they are all non-segwit complex hash lock smart contracts, it's probably like 2 tps.
You'd have to do some analysis on the current tx metrics, get the percentages of the different txs types, and also factor in the segwit and bech32 usage percentages to really answer that question.
I'm sure someone has done that work, and it's all presented nicely on an obscure website somewhere.  But I don't know the answer.
But the real tps breakthrough is the Lightning network.  There is no hard limit.  As fast as your network can physically broadcast out payments, they'll be confirmed nearly instantly, perhaps a few seconds.

"Legally", it doesn't matter if Gemini issues the 1099 or not.  The government will demand that you pay them a hefty portion.  Whether or not they'll go after you is another story.  If Gemini doesn't issue you the 1099, the government likely won't know about the earnings you've made.  However, if you don't pay, and somehow you get audited, or they find out, they're gonna fuck you with penalties, fees, and interest.  
It's definitely a tricky scenario.  The rule of thumb is that businesses send out their 1099s by January 31st.  So if you don't receive anything by the first week of February, you're probably in the clear.

You ignored my point entirely.


Yes, because drug users choose to do drugs.  Not because drug dealers exist.  If a drug dealer laced heroin with Fentanyl, to get users addicted quicker, then I'd agree that it was not victimless.  That's coercion.  But if a drug dealer sells heroin to a willing buyer, and both people are voluntarily entering into the agreement of their own free will, then it's absolutely a victimless crime.
What you're saying is that if I sell a knife on Amazon, and the buyer murders someone with that knife, that both I, and the CEO of Amazon should be arrest for murder.  That's fucking absurd.  A knife may be dangerous, and it may lead to death, but the seller of the knife if not responsible in any way.

No, it's just sending to many people at once.
If I have to pay 10 people, I can make 10 individual txs, or I can make 1 tx with 10 outputs.
They both accomplish the same goal, but the 1 tx with 10 outputs is much more efficient, because I only need one signature from 1 input. The 10 txs would require 10 signatures, taking up much more space in a block. Signature data is the largest part of the tx.
Couple this with Segwit, where signatures get a 75% discount, and this creates an even better scenario, freeing up even more block space for others.  Also, the sender saves a ridiculous amount of money in fees.

You need to pay two people.  Instead of sending *two* 1 input / 2 output txs (the other output being change), you can do a single 1 input / 3 output tx (three outputs being the two people you are sending to, plus one for change).
You've reduced total inputs from two to one.  This is the biggest cost savings, as each input requires a signature, which is the largest (and therefore most expensive) part of the tx.  You've also reduced total outputs from four to three, reducing UTXO bloat, and saving you additional space and fees.
This example is paying two people at once.  If you need to pay three or more, your cost savings will be even better.

Many reasons.  Paypal can censor your payments.  They can reverse payments.  They can deny payments.  They can freeze your funds.  They can garnish your funds on behalf of the government.  They can limit what they allow you to buy.  They can tell you who you are allowed to pay.  They have full control over your money, and simply allow you to use it for things they permit, with people they permit.
This is what centralization brings.
With Bitcoin, no one can tell you "no".  You can pay anyone, anytime, for any reason, without needing corporate or government permission.  No one can stop your payments, garnish you funds, or reverse your payments.
Bitcoin is permissionless, censorship resistant, trustless, and borderless.  You, and only you, have control of your funds.  There is no 3rd party trust at all.

In countries like Venezuela, they stayed pretty true to the socialist concept.  They've democratically seized the means of production from private entities to the collective.

Tx count is irrelevant.  I can make one single tx that pays 3 differnt people. Or I can make 3 separate txs that each individually pay one person each.  The same economic activity was conducted.  Why should the 3 tx version count more?  The reality is that the single tx paying 3 different people is more efficient, and better for the network.
Eth is entirely centralized around Vitalik.  He can unilaterally make decisions about the network, and no one will question him.  It's been years, and Eth can't even get a multisig contract ironed out.  Meanwhile they've been running on Bitcoin since day one.

Personally, I think the biggest bottleneck is bandwidth.  It's amazing how many people think a node just has to download 1-2mb of data every ten minutes.
They don't understand that a node relays every block and every tx to all other connected nodes (which could be over a hundred).  The upload/download requirements are tremendous.  It can easily eat up hundreds of GBs of bandwidth per month.  Not everyone has access to bandwidth like that, especially if you're trying to run over Tor.
Increasing the blocksize has a huge multiplying affect on bandwidth needed.  But making more txs fit in the same block doesn't increase bandwidth usage at all.  That is true scaling.  Segwit, Schnorr, signatures aggregation, MAST, Taproot, etc.  These are true scaling solutions.  Increasing the blocksize is not scaling.  It's ignoring scaling completely and just increasing resource requirements.

That's not accurate.   Segwit is just a different tx format type. Signature data is discounted, resulting in lower fees.

They are assigned a doctor.  If they don't like that doctor, they have to pay out of pocket to see another.
That situation sounds atrocious.  I am thankful that I am not forced to pay extraordinary amounts of money for subpar, rationed medical care.  I pay less than half of what they do, and it covers more people.  I have full choice over what doctors I see, and my care isn't rationed.

Ok, I never claimed we are; how is this relevant?


So get an electrician.  Are you saying electricians wouldn't exist without the state?


Hire a contractor.  Are you saying that contractors wouldn't exist without the state?


Is this a joke?


Please tell me you're kidding.  I know there are people who are too ignorant to understand that these things exist without the state, but you're actually trying to argue that point intelligently?
I never made a contract with the state.  I safely make contracts with electricians, contractors and cars companies because I trust their reputation, not having anything to do with the state.


The only reason 401k exist is because of theft.  Since the state is forcefully taking our money against our will, they threw us a little crumb and said, "if you save this money now, we won't steal it until you're 65."  And people like you get on your knees thanking your god (the state) for the generous gift of 401ks they so kindly offer.  It's a fucking scam.


Man, you need to read more.  Are you seriously under the impression that contracts cannot be enforced without the state?  I can potentially see why some ignorant people would think that, (since the state has taken over a forceful monopoly on contract enforcement), but there are still examples of privately run dispute resolution services.  This industry would thrive if the state didn't exist.  For instance, ever get scammed on ebay?  Ebay provides reputable dispute resolution without the need for the state.  Same with paypal.  There are also plenty of private and corporate dispute resolution services available that people trust in the real world over small claims court.  There are also private courts (Judge Judy) whose rulings are followed.  There are also [internet arbitration services]( available.
So before you reply back with a snide comment about Judge Judy, just remember, the important thing to realize is that these are just examples of private alternatives to the state's monopoly.  I'm not saying these are perfect or do a complete job, but they are potential examples.  If the state didn't provide dispute resolution at all, this industry would obviously boom as a need for these services would obviously exist.
So please, do not attempt to define anarchism when you quite obviously do not have a single clue of what you're talking about.

There seems to be two ways to get cross chain atomic swaps; either through [bitcoin scripts]( (which Cate seems to be), or through LN hubs running on multiple networks.
LN seems like the better option, since it'll support more coins (not just coins that are forks of bitcoin), and without any additional custom software beyond LN hubs, which I believe will lead to a more decentralized network.

Don't confuse "well connected" with "centralized".  We want many well connected hubs in the network topology.  The more the better.

"Addresses" can mean different things.  Yes, in this example, the address you're looking at is a hash of a public key.


That transaction has many inputs.  If you have 1000 bitcoin, but it's split up in 100 different addresses, you can still pay one person in one transaction.  That's all you're looking at here.

Segwit is just a new tx format that reduces fees, and allows for more tx throughput. These txs happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, just like regular old Bitcoin.
Lightning is a brand new network for instant txs. You can send sub-Satoshi micropayments that are confirmed instantly. But you need a Lightning wallet to use the Lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:34:39
My point is that these metrics are irrelevant.  Size is all that matters.  This block processed 1.7mb worth of txs.  That would have taken 2 blocks without segwit.  But because of segwit, they all fit in one block.  This helps clear the mempool faster, ensuring fees stay low, and txs are processed faster.

It's definitely not user friendly yet, but it's definitely *not* slower.  Transactions are as fast as an internet packet can travel.  There's no additionally "confirmation" time or waiting on a miner to find a block.  So it litterally *can't* be slower than an on-chain tx.


Yes, that's by design.  But this won't happen often.  The point is to open a channel once, then make weeks or months worth of instant txs, then close the channel.  Remember than you can pay anyone else on the network, not just the one person you have a channel with.

So this is actually how segwit was implemented initially.
With segwit, you can have two address types, one that starts with a "3", or one that starts with a "bc1".
The address that starts with "bc1" is a bech32 encoded segwit address.  It's a native address (similar to normal addresses that start with a "1").
But if you have a segwit address that starts with a "3", that is essentially what you're describing.  It's a p2pkh inside a p2sh.
Wallets that implement this are Trezor, Ledger, Samouri, and Bitcoin Core (v0.16.0).

Slush, BitFury, and GBminer make up almost 15% of the mining power, and they're all outside China.  There are other significant pools outside china also.  John Macafee's pool in the US.  Additionally, Antpool operates part of its pool in the US as well.
It wouldn't be a 95% drop in hashpower.  Even if it were made illegal, they would sell their hardware, or set up operations over the border.  It honestly wouldn't be a big deal.

There are steps in place to mitigate the task of reviewing source code.  The project has dozens of developers in an open source environment.  There are multiple separate teams who do peer review of the code.  There are multiple bug bounties in place.  There are hundreds of tests you can run yourself.
But yes, you are right, there is still some trust involved.  However the open source process removes trust from any single person.  There are hundreds of people involved from various companies and from solo developers.  They would all have to collude to steal from you.  If any single one of them get a whiff of anything weird, the whole thing blows up.  So compiling a very well peer-reviewed open-source project from source requires little to no trust.
On the other hand, letting Coinbase hold your coins requires full, complete, 100% trust in one single entity.
"Trust" is not a binary option.  It's a sliding scale.  Compiling a peer-reviewed, open-source project requires very little trust.  Letting Coinbase hold your coins for you is fucking blatant insanity.  There's no other way to describe it.

You do need to set up a Bitcoin full node first, and Lightning won't work if your node is pruned.  So you'll need a large harddrive attached to that pi to store the entire blokchain.. Also, syncing a bitcoin full node on a pi can take a few days to a week..
Thankfully, I already had a Bitcoin node running.

You're right.  I shouldn't have said *no* processing costs.  There are no storage costs, and dramatically lower processing costs, which are offset by the potential for revenue.


There is no benefit to broadcast your Lightning tx to every single node.  But there is benefit for the potential to do so, to be able to navigate partial network outages.
So it will be a sliding scale of decentralization that comes down to the average number of unique paths between any two nodes.
If you are only connected to a single other node, your routes will be limited, but just having a handful of channels ensures proper decentralization.

Are you unaware that segwit activated? That means that segwit isn't "anyone can spend".
It's a consensus rule. For a miner to try to spend your segwit output, they would fork themselves off the network. If they're willing to break a consensus rule to steal coins, then they can break any rule, and steal anyone's coins. But they'll be on their own network with no other miners or users. Your coins will still be safe on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Well connected "super nodes" will certainly exist.  That doesn't mean "centralization" though, because other routes exist as options.
The number of unique paths between two random nodes is what's important.  If the number is 1, then yes, we have centralization.  But right now, even spot checking the existing network map, that number is higher.
To ensure that you're well connected, with multiple route options, you should take a look at the existing map and strategically pick two unrelated nodes to connect to.  This will ensure you can't be cut off from the network because one "super node" went offline.
In the future, the Lightning wallets will handle all this in the background to ensure the network is sufficiently decentralized.

Segwit activated via soft fork.  Theoretically, blocks can be up to 4mb right now.  No more forks needed.  But in practice, 3.7mb is about the highest.
It works by separating witness data (signatures) from non-witness data.  Non-witness data is multiplied by 4 when calculating the size.  So the more segwit witness data that's included, the larger the bock can be.
[Segwit adoption is only about 2% right now.](  So blocks are only slightly larger than 1mb.  As this asdption increases, so will the blocksize.

Schnorr txs will be segwit txs, but with an updated script version.
An address is a hashed public key. A public key is derived from a private key via specific steps defined by the crypto specification that you're using.
I'm not 100% sure, but I believe you'll have to generate schnorr addresses, then send bitcoin to them.  I don't believe that you'll be able to spend existing outputs with a single aggregated signature. Again, I'm not 100% sure about this however.

Bitcoin cash barely has any users, developers, or businesses accepting it.  Blocks are under 10kb, and barely have any txs in them. No one actually uses it. 
It's a dying coin with absolutely no potential for growth.
The only reason the market cap seems to be at large at it is, is because the vast majority of bitcoin users never even bothered touching their BCH.  The actually supply on exchanges is miniscule, which is why the price is so high per coin.  The entire market cap is an illusion.

Segwit is a new tx format type that allows more txs to fit in each block.  The more it is used, the more it helps lower fees for everyone and process more txs per second.
In short, this is very good and means lower fees.  If you want lower fees, you should be using a wallet that support segwit (Samurai, Electrum, Trezor, Ledger, Bitcoin Core).
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:10:14

@_date: 2018-02-02 04:33:44
Segwit is a new tx format.  You can fit more txs in a block when using segwit, so the higher the adoption, the lower fees will be for everyone, since more txs are being processed in each block.
Lightning is a network of payment channels, allowing unlimited txs per second with each channel.
So you can open up a channel (which costs one blockchain tx), then conduct limitless txs on the Lightning network, paying merchants, buying goods, etc.  And finally settle on the blockchain with a closing tx (this could be weeks or months later).
So for the cost of only 2 Bitcoin txs, you can literally conduct an unlimited amount of txs on Lightning.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:08:16


That makes no sense.  Opening a channel happens in advance.  For instance I opened one last Friday.  Now, I can pay anyone on the Lightning network instantly, whenever I want.

It has no affect on new payments I'm making over Lightning now.

I'm looking at fungibility from a privacy point of view, from a person engaging in economic activity that the state frowns upon.
A peaceful marijuana grower may need to convert the bitcoin he's earned to USD.  But by doing so, he may reveal that he's a large marijuana grower, causing him many problems.
With cross-chain swaps, he can convert his bitocin to Monero, then convert it back to bitcoin.  He can deposit onto Coinbase, convert to USD and there are no problems.  No links.
This is the big fungibility problem that exists.  Cross chain atomic swaps solve this.
What you linked to is not really significant.  I don't care if some noodle wants to buy a freshly minted coins at a premium.  This has no significance on the market.  He's likely trying to do this because he has tainted coins (from a drug sale).  Cross chain atomic swaps would solve his problem.

Erik, thanks for the response.
Can you elaborate how Shapeshift plans to handle the fork exactly?
At the exact block height of the fork, will you by default, just use the BTC1 software, and continue to call it bitcoin?
Or will you stop all trading and see what the result of the fork is after a few hours?
What if futures trading indicates that the 2x altcoin is worth significantly less than the Bitcoin legacy chain before the fork? Will you reevaluate?

Yes.  So they're saying that if the address is just a p2pkh inside a p2sh, then the attack is useless anyway, so it remains unchanged.  But if it's another type of p2sh (like multisig), segwit increases security to use SHA256.

Great to see segwit's potential for capacity increase in the wild.
And as for Antpool, I get the concept of "spy mining" during the ~10 second window between a competing pool finding a block, and you being able to fully download and validate it.

This was my thought too.  It would be a waste of a lot of money to switch over to 2x, mine it for a few hours (or days), then switch back when they realize it's not profitable.
The miners know this risk exists.  I think they'll get cold feet when it comes time to actually switch chains.  Any miner that stays with the Bitcoin (non-2x) chain will be rewarded by acting in their own best interest, just as the Satoshi intended.

It's not likely to be common, since the txs in that block would all have to be very heavy on witness data.  So it will happen, but likely not regularly.  I expect blocks to be roughly 1.7mb-2.1mb regularly once segwit is heavily adopted.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:55:47


Correct.  Sending to a segwit address from a legacy address is not counted on this chart, since that is a legacy tx that took place.  The receiving address doesn't matter.  This chart graphs out how many transactions are coming from segwit addresses.

It takes a conscience effort to switch.  Yes, while BCH was temporarily more profitable by small margins (2-3%) for a brief one hour period, I didn't expect miners to switch.
But in any prolonged period where BCH was significantly more profitable, a large majority of miners switched over.
So yes, things can get weird when profitability teeters back and forth.  But as long as a single chain sustains significantly more profitability, miners will mine that chain, period.
I expect Bitcoin to be significantly more profitable to mine than B2X, so even if a fork occurs, I expect miners to switch back once they assess the situation.  If I'm wrong, that means that there was significant economic consensus around 2x as a non-contentious protocol upgrade.

I keep wondering exactly how it's going to play out.
I imagine that Antpool will at least attempt to get the 2x chain going, so the split is likely to occur. But how many miners are actually running the btc1 software? I doubt many are.
I don't believe 2x will ever get more than 50% of the hashrate, and whatever mining support they do get will dwindle quickly as they switch back to bitcoin for more revenue.
I'd absolutely love it if the 2x fork never happens though. If they all get cold feet and realize it's a bad mistake. That would be highly enjoyable.

The existing decentralized exchanges that I'm aware of use third party escrow.

There isn't a hard rule for any Lightning implementation that says you must have a local full node running.
But you need to be able to read the blockchain, and broadcast txs.  Full nodes already do that.  So I think a lot of the early implementations are just relying on an existing full node just to not have to recreate the wheel.

He wouldn't get his original coins back.  He swapped out his "tainted" coins for other coins.
By having instant, trustless atomic swaps available as an option, coins will always be capable of being sufficiently mixed throughout the network.  If you look far enough back in an output's history, output will be "tainted" at some point.  So what is Coinbase going to do, ban bitcoin?
Yes, I agree that coins that solved fungibility at the protocol level will be better at this.  Hopefully this can be solved on Bitcoin in the future too.
But in the meantime, cross chain atomic swaps solves the problem for anyone looking to get different coins.

So again, once all coins are "tainted", none of them are.


I agree that things could be better.  I'm simply saying that the idea of a "tainted" coin is not really going to ever be a thing once cross chain atomic swaps are popular.  There will be nothing anyone can do to stop it.  Everything will be mixed.  Every single coin will be "tainted".

All the Bitmain appologists always say "but all miners will spy-mine".  And that is true.  All miners will spy mine (in the ~30 second period between hearing about another pool finding a block, and actually being able to download and verify that block).
This is not spy mining.  4 minutes is plenty of time to download and verify a block.  Antpool is the only pool that consistently mines empty blocks this long after the previous block has been found.

Do you have evidence of this?
I doubt what you're saying because there is some logic to say that the segwit2x chain must start with a &gt;1mb block at a certain block height, for wipeout protection.  If you just change the blockweight, you wouldn't enforce this rule, which means that a 2x chain could be wiped out by a longer 1x chain.  I don't think miners or nodes would introduce that risk.  Additionally, if all you did was change blockweight, miners would be producing &gt;1mb blocks right now, which they're not.
Additionally, the reason there are so few btc1 nodes is because the market doesn't want segwit2x.  Any miner that forks will find out what consensus really means, and will pay for it out of their own pocket.

For some further clarification, Schnorr sigs (even without signature aggregation) are much faster to verify than ECDSA sigs.
Signatures aggregation makes huge improvements (both tx size and verification times) on multisig and batching, by requiring only one signature in total for each tx, instead of one signature per public key (which is what's required now).

Because people were forced to use the currency their government demanded them to use.  The US, the UK, China, India, and Russia all demand their citizens use specific currencies, which is why there are 5 main ones.  It has nothing to do with mature markets or competition.  It has everything to do with laws.
Bitcoin isn't in one country, it's global.  And money works different.  If there are two competing currencies, they don't just co-exist.  The better one wins out, because those who use the inferior one will simply lose all their value in the long run compared to those who use the superior one.

First of all this is a strawman fallacy.  Second, "fundamentally changes bitcoin" is not the argument against it.  Third, who is "eager" to change PoW?  A couple anonymous twitter accounts?
Step 1: Relax.
Step 2:  Realize that we're against segwit2x because it's a contentious change.  That's it.  I'm willing to accept an additional blocksize increase after we see how segwit adoption goes, but only if it's universally accepted (non-contentious), and it addresses long term growth (not just a one-time bump).  [Something like BIP103 would be great](
Last, a PoW change that is non-contentious among the community is a nuclear option.  No one is eager for it, and it'll only work if everyone is on the same page.  This is a last ditch option if the miners prove to be attacking bitcoin.

Obviously. 


Technically, you don't know that since the firmware isn't open source.
I highly doubt that they know your private keys, but technically, there could be some code that says 1/10000 accounts are given a non random private key that was already generated at the ledger offices.
By the way, I have both a ledger and a trezor and I don't think ledger is doing anything like this, but theoretically it's possible.

Ok, so you're agreeing that bcash serves no purpose then?  And that the blocksize "experiment" was already alive in Litecoin?  Thanks.  That was my point.


No one ever said that a larger blocksize wouldn't process more txs.  That's not the argument against it.  The argument it is that an increased blocksize requires more network/storage/processing requirements over time, and will lead to less people running full nodes over time, which will centralize the network into the hands of a few mega-corporations.  This kills the parts of Bitcoin that make it revolutionary, if corporations can censure your txs.

(Outputs - Transactions) is a decent metric.
In your example of 100 transactions, each with one "real" output, and one change output, that would be (200 - 100) = 100 "real" outputs.
In your example of the single batched transaction with 100 "real" outputs, and one change output, that would be (101 - 1) = 100 "real" outputs.
In both cases the result is the same.

Yea, I understand that, but this thing is in no way similar to a Trezor.  wallet generation isn't what makes Trezor a great device.  The offline transaction signing, and security features are what make it what it is.

Figure 12 is the most important one.
Different forms of validationless mining would explain empty blocks being produced by everyone.
They are economically incentivized to spy mine in the ~30 seconds between hearing about another block and actually verifying it.  All pools should do this to maximize revenue.
But empty blocks being produced outside of roughly 30 seconds from the previous block is what I find suspect.

No I'm not.  There are multiple ways of "increasing bitcoin's capacity".  Increasing the max blocksize is just one way.  However, just saying that users should move their transactions off the bitcoin blockchain doesn't increase capacity of anything.
That's like me advocating moving to litecoin for day to day transactions, then claiming that I'm increasing bitcoin's capacity.  It's just simply not true.
By the way, I think off-chain transactions, LN, and side chains will be very beneficial to the future of crypto-currencies.  I'm just simply stating the fact that they do not increase bitcoin's capacity.  In order to increase bitcoin's capacity, some part of the protocol has to change in order to allow actual capacity to grow.

Well when using Tails to generate an offline wallet, you would keep your networking off, to avoid any potential compromise that involves sending your private keys over the internet.
This means a lot of trust in those components are not needed.  Those things could be compromised, and my private keys would still be safe.
The only thing you really have to trust is the Electrum software that is generating the keys, and perhaps any linux libraries that are used by Electrum's key generation code.
If those are compromised in advance, and the resulting private keys that you're generating are limited to a predefined set, then you'd be hosed.
But the latest version of Tails has been out for a while, is open source, can be verified, and none of these things have happened.
Don't get me wrong, I like this T1-89 private key generator, because you're right, it does limit trust, but I still feel safe generating an offline HD seed on Electrum/Tails..  I feel safer still using a Trezor, and again, then I have added bonus of being able to do offline transaction signing..

Well I agree that everything is always vulnerable to something. The point is to mitigate the most dangerous vulnerabilities.
In my opinion, a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger is the most secure option because the keys are never accessible, even by you. By design, you cannot access the keys under any circumstances.
A paper wallet is likely more secure for just plain cold storage, but you can't spend from a paper wallet. So you have to import your keys into a wallet, which exposes them.

My source is just reading how all the privacy works in these various technologies.  Dash's privacy is a joke.  Master nodes just obfuscate your info.  But you have to trust that the master nodes are honest, and they have the ability to view your the details of your private txs.  So this is not private at all.  It's just marketing, and tricking the ignorant.
Anything zk-snarks related required centralized master keys for initializing the blockchain.  That's literally how the whole protocol works.  So by using any of those coins, you're trusting that the initial centralized creators don't still have their keys.
Monero is the only private coin that uses actual trustless cryptography.  There are no central keys.  There are no master nodes obscuring anything.  It's just RingCT, BulletProofs, and coin mixing by default with no trusted central actors.


Nothing about Lightning is trusted.  It's entirely decentralized and trustless, and just relies on standard private key signing and onion routing.  Even if I give you my Lightning node id, or channel ids, you coudln't tell me anything about the txs I've made.  That's why it's much more private than Bitcoin (and most other alts).  However I admit it's not as private as Monero.


Lightning improves scaling, privacy, and confirmation times.  The scaling and conf times are unparalleled in this space for a decentralized coin.  


Lol.  Name one coin that has addressed scalling.  Increase the max block size is not a scalaing solution.  That just linearly increases costs as the network grows.  That's literally the opposite of scaling.  A scaling solution is so you can grow the network without linear costs associated.  Lightning is the only tech I've seen so far that addresses this. If you can point to another, I'm all ears.


Granted, it's young and not very user friendly right now.  But I'm just talking about the tech.  User adoption takes time.

And I think it's naive to believe that the current model is the only or best one.  I think our current model of society is pretty bad actually, and needs a lot of improvement.
In every stage of human history, there were sheep who thought that there was no better model for society than the one they were currently in.  Then there were visionaries, who had the foresight to envision a *better* society, breaking the existing paradigm, despite being called "naive", crazy, or stupid.
I don't accept our current model.  I think it's inherently violent, oppressive, and systematically unfair to various people.  I envision something better.  Just because you happen to like the current system, does not mean it's the best it could be.  I simply want to change that.


Of course they are!  A free market is the most democratic form of governance that there is.  With a free market, if an entity acts immorally, or provides bad goods/services, they are subject to bankruptcy and complete replacement.  They will vanish at the hand of the people.  That is true democracy.  In a state government model, this can't happen.  Poorly run government agencies will continue to exist, and waste money despite providing terrible goods/services.  In short, there is no accountability in the government model.


If the people truly care about pollution, they will boycott well known polluters.  Additionally, there will be no protection from lawsuits in a libertarian society.  Today, the government grants corporations a "limited liability" status.  In a libertarian society, no such protection will exist, and every business will be held liable in civil courts.  That expensive would add up for firms being constantly sued.  The market will prefer more efficient and competitors, who will be able to offer lower prices by not having to constantly waste money defending pollution cases.


If two private companies can build two competing bridges right next to each other, and both profit via tolls, then I'd argue that two bridges were needed.  Additionally, this competition will ensure tolls stay low.  Unlike today when bridges/tunnels are operated by government monopolies.  The NY Port Authority controls all of the crossings between NY and NJ, and their tolls have skyrocketed because there is no competition.  They can literally charge anything they want, and we have no say about it.  In fact, they currently [charge as much as $126 dollars *each way* when crossing]( any of the 6 bridges and tunnels in their control.  I want competition to this monopoly.  Only the market can provide healthy competition.  It'll never come from a centrally controlled authority.

On layer 1 (the blockchain), every node in the network must store, verify, and relay every single tx forever.  There is no direct compensation for this.  This is why increased blocksize centralizes the network.  As the burden to run a node gets higher, more nodes shut off until only a few large corporate nodes exist.
With Lightning, the requirement to store, relay, and verify each tx does not exist.  Nodes will find the shortest possible route throughout the network, and only those nodes in that route relay the tx.  There is no storage or processing costs.  Additionally, these nodes will be compensated with small fees for each relay.

Yes.  Another benefit of segwit was that it introduced script versioning.  This means that we can just increment the script version to introduce a whole new set of opcodes.

Running a node is in your best interest.  That's the incentive.
Do you want to rely on the network to verify your transactions, or do you want to verify your incoming transactions yourself?
That's the incentive.
Everyone loves to say that bitcoin is trustless, but then they blindly trust some random node out there.
It's only trustless if you do the transaction verification yourself.  This is the incentive to run a full node.

That's not how hardware devices work. The private keys are generated on the device and never leave the device. They're always completely offline, even when connected to a computer. 
Your wallet software will be a web or mobile wallet. That's what generates your transactions. The device simply signs the transaction. It's by far the safest type of wallet, and the only way to spend from an offline device without ever importing your keys into an internet connected device.

In reality though, even you'd have to agree that a single 1-click confirmation prompt on your phone is much less annoying than an email that you' have to copy an address from, then paste into your wallet app and send a payment with a different amount of BTC each time..  Lots of rooms for user error.  You can't compare a 1-click solution to a round-about email invoice..
For $7 a month, I wouldn't mind a no-confirmation payment from my wallet.  If it was more than that, I really wouldn't mind a 1-click solution.

With write caches, the data is eventually written to the disk.  With LN, my transaction will never actually be recorded to or visible in the blockchain.  My transaction (in addition to many others) will be represented as a single settlement transaction between two third party payment hubs.
So as a user, I lose the benefit of the blockchain as a publicly verifiable ledger of transactions.  I must now rely on third party payment hubs to relay my transactions.  I won't be able to compete with banks and payment networks for transaction fees, so I will be priced out of the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:37:49
Considering that there is no lightning network yet, it's hard to say what it is or isn't.
That being said, [watch this presentation]( by the developers.
It clearly paints the LN as a hub and spoke model of payment channels. This isn't disputed.
They routinely refer to "Bob", the hub, who facilitates payments between users. They mention that Bob will likely be a "rich" entity like coinbase or mastercard, who will potentially profit by selling transaction information of its users.
I'm not sure what you think LN is supposed to be, but this is right from the horses's mouth.
As I've said, I'm not opposed to this and I do think it will compliment larger blocks. My only point is that this doesn't allow more bitcoin transactions. It just pushes people off the blockchain.

Side chains and the lightning network isn't scaling bitcoin.  It's encouraging people to use something other than the bitcoin blockchain. While this may be useful, this doesn't scale bitcoin.  Raising the block size actually scales bitcoin.

This effectively describes the lightning network.  I'm not sure why you felt compelled to write all that, because I said earlier that I believe the LN will be beneficial to the future of crypto-currency.
I simply said I believe that bitcoin should scale natively.  The arbitrary and artificial limit placed on the network right now is dangerous.  Systems nearing capacity don't operate efficiently.  LN is nothing more than a pipe-dream at this stage.  I'm sure in a few years, it will be impressive, but that's neither here nor there.
Raising the blocksize limit is a safe, native solution that can be extremely easy to implement.  I honestly prefer Satoshi's suggestions better than any of the BIPs that have been submitted:
    if blockheight &gt; 390000:
        maxblocksize = 4000000
Something like that... 
LN will compliment bitcoin in the future, but there will be nothing to compliment if bitcoin can't handle any real world volume on its own.

I've thought about solutions to this before and I think I have a pretty cool solution that doesn't involve any payment processors or trusted third parties (like Coinbase or Circle).
There could be a simple API standard that gets developed.  Merchants can implement it and advertise "We support the Bitcoin Recurring Payment Standard 1.0 (BRPS1)".
Then various wallet software could be set up to interface with it.  So Electrum could advertise that they support it as well.
You configure your wallet (Electrum or MyCellium or whatever) to point to "Netflix" or whatever merchant you're using (there could be a list of merchants that are known to accept payments via the BPRS1 standard.  You input the details (weekly, monthly, etc.. pick the start date and potential end date, and the price)
Each month your wallet software requests a new payment address from the merchant via the API, then automatically sends a payment.  It could even prompt you for an optional confirmation..
The standard would exist so that the wallet developers wouldn't have to adhere to 600 different merchant payment APIs.  If they all agree to use a single standard, there would be no code changes needed for the client software, and it would be compatible for an infinite number of future merchants.
The end user would know nothing of how the API works.  Just pick a merchant from a list, put in your API key or account number for that service (this will have to be given to you by the merchant), select the day of the month you want your payment to go through and the amount (specified in BTC,USD,Euro,etc)..
No trust, no identity, no PII.  Easy reoccurring payments in bitcoin.  Nothing is sensitive about the information, and you can even get your friends account number if you wanted to buy them a free month or something..

Yes, there was a bitcointalk thread where me mentioned it.  I'll try to dig it up.


Yes it does.  Mining requires a full node.  Before mining pools, every single miner needed to run a full node.  Once mining pools started every person just turned off their node and pointed their hashes to the pool.  So one node replaced thousands of nodes.  That's the definition of centralization.


That is ad hominem.

Their entire business model hinges on these mincrotransaction getting on the blockchain.  This is how their network works.  They want hardware to be able to communicate and transact via the blockchain.


That's the thing.  No one would ever include these transactions.  This is why they are including miners in their hardware.  So that they control the pool.  So they can include their own microtransactions into the blocks that they mine.

None of that has anything to do with the privacy of the blockchain.

So I think we can all see why including bitcoin as a resource would be beneficial to this product.  I can only speculate as to why they chose to include that resource in the form of a mining chip, as opposed to just pre-loading actual bitcoin.
First, it adds to their pool's total power.  This has many benefits for them as a company (steadier payouts and the ability to confirm their own low or no-fee transactions from their hardware come to mind).  Second, their mining chips could have already been produced, so including them in this product could have been a cheaper option than to preload each computer with X bitcoin.  Third, perhaps there was a tax liability for distributing actual bitcoin.
I can think of a few other reasons too..  In the end, I don't think it's that crazy.

You're talking about the government making a law that made bitcoin illegal.  This would be brought up to the supreme court and most likely overturned on the ground of free speech.  But yes, if the government did successfully for the first time in history make a piece of the internet completely illegal and for some reason, the supreme court held it up, yes, connections to the network would be slightly slower since it would have to be anonymized and encrypted.  But who cares?  My point is that bitcoin is impossible to ban and will never go away; not that bitcoin will always be ridiculously fast.


No, technically it can't.  Tor can be encrypted and ran through port 443 making it indistinguishable from normal web traffic.
So yes, if the government decides to shutdown the entire internet, bitcoin may get blocked.  But at that point, there would still be a illegal black market internet that was capable of running bitcoin.

Oh no?  Then what was this?


Seems as though you did..


This argument only makes sense if you talk about massive increases in the blocksize, well beyond what people can handle.  But in an age of cheap terabyte drives, 16GB+ of ram available on even the crappiest of Dells, and multi-hundred Mb to Gb bandwidth available in every major city in the world, a 1MB blocksize is laughably small.  There is a ton of room to grow before nodes can only be hosted in professional data centers, which I want to avoid as well.
In fact, I propose that an increase to the max blocksize will decrease centralization.  The effect is already visible.  When BIP101 was released (in BitcoinXT) about 500 new nodes were added to the network that week.  The masses *want* to support larger blocks.
A sensible, predictable, smooth blocksize increase that keeps up with technology will not increase centralization.
@_date: 2011-12-01 18:03:05


That is absolutely ridiculous and completely false.  Sure, the first person to ever try to sell something in bitcoin would probably be pulling a figure out of his ass, but the market evolves.  Prices will be negotiated on a supply/demand basis.  This is the foundation of economics.  Think of bitcoin as an agreed upon medium for bartering goods and services.
I completely agree with the OP.  We should stop thinking of bitcoin in terms of US dollars.  That is what is holding bitcoin back.
Bitcoin will flourish when you can work for bitcoin and buy your food/pay your rent with bitcoin.  It has nothing to do with pinning it to the USD.

These nodes will be talking to each other with satoshis at a time.  You're *never* going to get these transactions included in a block.

How can you *still* be missing the point?  If they want to do microtransactions (which is in their press release), "standard fees" will likely be equal to or greater than the cost of the transaction in the first place.  Why are you ignoring this?  It doesn't make sense if your fee is just as high as your transaction.  No one wants &gt;100% fees.

Again I agree.  But they don't want Nakamoto consensus to work.  They want their chain to survive as a separate chain no matter what.  Which kind of proves that they don't intend to be an "upgrade" to bitcoin.  They intend to exist as a separate chain.

I respect that you at least concede the fact that the LN and sidechains do not increase bitcoin's capacity.  Originally, you stated that it does.
Also, are you really asking for me to explain the benefits of scaling to you?


The internet has literally scaled.  Moving from IPv4 to IPv6 is an example.  The internet didn't grow by creating another separate network, then telling people to use that, then broadcast "settlement" consolidated groups of packets to the internet, in some round about side-chain method.  The internet is growing by changing the protocols used and allowing more native users.

What are you talking about?  This proposal doesn't relate to modern banking in any way, shape or form at all.  You are still making regular bitcoin payments.  This is absolutely no different than any service where you pay with bitcoin today, expect that it streamlines it a little for ease of use.


That's a benefit of the system.  This is why I use bitcoin.  There's no need for identity in this transaction.  If you want to give Netflix your personal information, be my guest, but for this service, it's unnecessary and irrelevant.
Your payment will be on the blockchain.  They can't say you never paid them if you can prove your account was funded.


Lol.. This is true regardless of whether you use my proposal or not.  If Netflix decides it's shifting it's business model from "provide streaming services for $7.99 a month" to "take $7.99 from every once, then scam them", they'll be out of business in a week.

That was the first thing I explained to you.  A soft fork cannot result in a split chain if it has &gt;50% of miner support.  A hard fork guarantees a chain split with anything less than 100% support.


What's your question though?  Segwit as a hard fork (SWHF) offers no additional benefit.  If you were able to show that SWHF had definitive advantages, I'd then weight the risk of the hard fork against those extra benefits.
But as it stands, there are none.  So you'd be taking on additional risk for nothing.


No it wasn't.  The 95% threshold is defined in BIP9, which was developed long before segwit was a thought.  Before BIP9, soft forks were rolled out via flag day activation, much like BIP148 (UASF) is being proposed.  This is literally how Satoshi and Gavin used to roll out soft forks.

Miner's, no.  But i believe you access RSK tokens by locking up Bitcoin in a federated trust.
When you want your bitcoin back, you lock up your RSK tokens. I could be wrong, but I believe that the federated trust is a multisig wallet that requires 51% of the private keys from a large group of RSK investors, miners, developers, etc.  It's pretty low risk, and seems to work like coins with "masternodes".
It's obviously less secure than bitcoin, and does require a small amount of trust, but it's still a really cool technology, and I hope it does well.

This was the final goalpost shifting argument from those wishing for bitcoin's demise.
First, Lightning was "vaporware" (despite multiple implementations being openly developed).  Then, once it was overwhelmingly clear that it indeed existed, the argument shifted to, "they'll never solve the routing problem."  Then, once it was clear that onion routing was chosen and worked well, the argument shifted again.  "It'll tend towards centralization over time."
It is now clear that with each passing month, the Lightning network becomes more and more decentralized, exactly the opposite of their arguments.
These people are delusional, and only criticize Lightning, because accepting it means there is no need for shitcoins like Bitcoin Cash to exist.

The power consumption difference is negligible, and now your refrigerator can transact in bitcoin.  It can make and receive payments.  For what?  Who knows yet.

I think ideas like side chains and the lightning network are absolutely essential to the future of bitcoin, but I am somewhat concerned with paid employees of a company making bitcoin protocol changes that directly help that company profit.
I'm not saying that anyone's intentions are bad, or that this is going to kill bitcoin.  Just the opposite.  I think the intentions here are good, and this is vital to the future of bitcoin.
But the idea that a corporation's employees making protocol changes that directly enable that corporation to profit is definitely frightening.  I'm not sure there's even going to be a way to protect against that, as almost everyone can be influenced by money..
But, as they say, ["It's good to be the king."](

You're talking about actual BTC --&gt; fiat conversions.  He's talking about the pool of people willing to participate in a BTC --&gt; fiat conversion.
When there are more buyers than sellers, the price moves up, since buyers have to compete with one another for a seller's coins.
When there are more sellers than buyers, the price moves down, since sellers have to compete with one another for a buyer's fiat.

If the cost of the miner has already been recouped, I'd still mine at a slight loss.
You're basically just converting your electricity into bitcoin, and the best part is that these bitcoin aren't associated with your identity on an exchange.  Also, if you're mining, you believe in bitcoin, which means you believe the price will go up.  So you can mine for months at a "loss" only to have the price shoot up and you instantly turned months of mining at a "loss" into profit.

I'm not sure what the point of you first paragraph is.  That because a soft fork is not 100% risk free, then we might as well take on as much risk as possible?  That's not an argument.  Soft forks are objectively safer than hard forks, and will very likely not split the chain at all.  With a hard fork, you're almost entirely guaranteed to split the chain.  There is no additional benefit gained for taking on that extra risk.


Might?  How is this an argument?  I can say the exact same thing.  Segwit as a hard fork might produce some bad consequences in the future, so we must do it as a soft fork.  See how absurd that is?

What you're missing is that without the ability to post the transaction on the blockchain, LN relies on trusted third parties.
What makes LN trustless is that you can post the transaction to the blockchain to override bad actors.
What is being said is that if the fee to broadcast to the blockchain is too high, we lost our ability to broadcast our small tx, which then makes LN useless.
LN will be cool, but artificially created fee markets is a bad idea.  The blockchain needs to be able to scale on its own, in addition to side chains and LN.

Because with a soft fork, as long as &gt;50% of miners support it, there is absolutely no risk of a chain split.
As a hard fork, anything less than 100% support *will definitively cause a chain split*.


Yea, they didn't realize it was possible as a soft fork at first.


I'm not saying that hard forks don't make sense.  I'm saying that if it's possible to deploy as a soft fork, *then* it makes no sense to take on the extra risk of a hard fork.  You're increasing the risk for absolutely no additional reward.

First, as others have pointed out, the pools are likely not actually running BU software.  They're likely just signaling EB/AD values in the coinbase text, mimicking BU.

Governments can attempt to do whatever they want.  Whether they're successful or not is another story.
The best way to tumble bitcoin is to simply convert to monero, then convert back to bitcoin in small amounts.  Monero has no address history, and can't be traced.
The only way to attempt to stop this would be to ban all cryptocurrency exchanges.  Even then, users could just use Tor.


Again, they can try.  First, you should never, under any circumstances, let an exchange hold your funds.  Hold them self, and simply move to the exchange when you want to make a trade.  But immediately withdraw after the trade is done.  But regardless, black markets would still exist.  Just like banning drugs doesn't actually stop drug use.

I'm obviously in favor of segiwt, but I'm totally fine with a long term blocksize increase like BIP103.
What I'm not OK with is BU and their "emergent consensus".  BU is a buggy disaster.  Even if it was all implemented in a non-vulnerable way, I'd still be against it in principle.
It sets us up for an infinite number of future hard forks every time a majority of hashing power has a certain combination of EB/AD values.  This will lead to miners attacking each other, and a centralization towards large pools who want to keep out small miners.
So let's get segwit now, and something like BIP103 soon after.  Then we're made in the shade.

It incentivizes empty or near empty blocks, since it's harder to malleate with a large data sets.
Aside from incentivizing empty blocks, I wouldn't care too much about asicboost in general if all miners were doing it from time to time.
The real problem is that this is patented by Bitmain.  With the Chinese government protecting Bitmain's monopoly on this process, this will slowly kill fair free-market competition, and mining will consolidate into the hands of one man.  That's the fear.
Additionally, you can't mine segwit blocks and use covert asicboost.  So Jihan is likely blocking segwit, not because it's bad tech, but because he wants to protect his state-issued monopoly.

You trust the central bankers, who can trigger inflation and make your money worthless.  You trust your local bank who doesn't actually hold the money you deposit.  They loan it out to others.  You just have some numbers in a database somewhere.  Even when you are handed cash, you trust that the bill is not counterfeit.
Enter bitcoin.  Bitcoin enables peer2peer payments, across the globe, in minutes, without third party trust.  This concept is revolutionary.  It was not possible before bitcoin.
This network is extremely valuable.  Bitcoin is impossible to counterfeit.  Plus add in the fact that there is a fixed supply of bitcoin with a predictable distribution rate, making it deflationary, and you've got a recipe for a very reliable store of value.

80% has to be maintained throughout an entire signaling period.  Each signaling period is like 2.5 days long.
I don't know the exact block numbers of each signaling period, but I read that the next one will start tomorrow or Thursday.
So if we hit 80% before that period starts, and maintain it throughout the entire period (2.5 days), then it's locked in.  So after another full signaling period (as a grace period), the code is active and non-segwit blocks will be orphaned.  So we could see this in action by next Tuesday or Wednesday.
If this period is missed it would be another 2.5 days out.

I don't think it'll be that simple.
I think the users and the miners are *very* split.  The mining power seems to slightly favor BU, but bitcoin users and businesses [*overwhelmingly* support segwit](
Even if the miners attempt to fork the chain, the non BU chain will be worth much more on exchanges.  This will cause miners to switch back when the realize it's more profitable.
This is an extremely dangerous scenario.  One that I don't think many BU supporters have ever thought through.
Thankfully, BU hasn't planned this out very well, and if the non-BU chain ever regains the majoirty hashing power, it'll wipe out the BU chain entirely.  Anyone who had any BU-tokens would lose everything instantly.  This is ultimately why BU is nothing but an empty threat.
Segwit provides an on-chain capacity increase without *any* of these risks.  Segwit is superior by design and implementation in every conceivable way.
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:15:08
Think of it almost as trading signed transactions.
You "pay" me by giving me a copy of a signed transaction.  I can broadcast this to the blockchain if I want.  But we want to save on fees.  So we'll just trade more signed transactions back and forth.  After some period of time, we simply broadcast one transaction to the blockchain, which settles the balances of our long chain of transactions back and forth.
All of these transactions are time-locked in a relative manor, so no one can scam the other person.  It's all trustless and decentralized.
Now imagine this on a global scale with more than two people.  Transactions are traded and grouped together, then eventually settled on the blockchain to finalize the balances.  Again, it will all be trustless and decentralized (after CSV and segwit are released).
Each transaction on the blockchain will represent many off-chain transactions.

Yea, new features are generally introduced as "soft forks".  All that means is a protocol upgrade that doesn't break existing clients.  it's compatible with legacy software.
So for instance, if you only have Microsoft Word from 1997, you can still load a .docx file (created from Mircosoft Word 2012 for instance).  Your old version of Word can't understand the new features that were introduced, but it still loads.
In bitcoin they try to make changes work this way, so old non-upgraded clients will still work.  They just can't use the new features.
In order to do this without disrupting the network, a majority of users need to upgrade to enforce the new rules, so that people don't abuse it.  Generally that's measured by miners.  It's not a perfect system, but it's worked in the past.  Some miners are supporting segwit, but others aren't.
Others want a "hard fork" which means an incompatible upgrade.  This is like Microsoft making a brand new document format called .newdoc or something and a new word processor called NewWord.  Your old version of Word will not understand the file at all and will not be compatible at all.  You will have to upgrade to NewWord to read this new file.  A hard fork change is much harder to implement because it requires that everyone upgrade.  If you don't upgrade, you'll end up on a different blockchain than everyone else.  They call this a "chain split".
I prefer soft forks, because there is much less chance of a chain split, and old bitcoin users don't have anything to worry about.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:54:10
I was actually thinking the same thing.  I kind of wish the developers would just agree to it all now, knowing that a hard fork won't happen in the future.  Let's fucking get segwit activated.
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:44:56


@_date: 2017-05-18 18:13:22


Theoretically, yes.  But it requires more than just miners.  If only miners supported it, but the users didn't, the chain would likely split.  The miners would likely mine the chain that gives them the most money.  But yes, when a majority of miners and users both want the change, and it's a soft fork change, then it goes through smoothly.  There have been many successful soft fork upgrades in bitcoin's history.
Anyone can attempt to make these protocol changes.  But yes, you need overwhelming support from the community to get your changes adopted.
Segwit has been trying to get activated for like 6 or 7 months now.


That is a possibility in a hard fork that doesn't have unanimous support.  That happened to Ethereum.  They wanted a hard fork change, but a small group didn't want it, so the chain split, that's why there is Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, now two different altcoins.
But it is unlikely to happen.  Miners will likely loose revenue if they disrupt the market, so they won't do it on a whim.

Yes.  If 51% of miners orphan non-segwit blocks, the chain will then have 100% segwit signaling, which will trigger the BIP9 activation on all nodes &gt;=13.1.

Antpool is leveraging chinese patents to give themselves an unfair mining advantage.

They also put backdoors in all of their mining products to control them remotely.

The normal circumstance when you see an empty block is that a miner happened to get lucky, and found a block before they've finished verifying the previous block.  In this scenario, there's no downside.  It makes sense to produce an empty block.  There's nothing wrong or weird with that.
But this was over 2 minutes later.  That is plenty of time to verify the previous block.
What's even weirder is that Antpool was the one to create the previous block, so there's no need to verify it again.  They would have ensured the block was valid before broadcasting it in the first place, and they would have already known what transactions were in it.
What's even weirder still, is that the block isn't empty.  It actually contains a very small amount of transactions.
This wreaks of covert asicboost.

@_date: 2015-03-18 15:41:14


How so?
First of all, Gavin's plan is to phase up to higher block sizes, not just go to 20mb tomorrow.  Second, blocks today are still around a half a meg or smaller.  Even if the limit was raised, that doesn't mean blocks would magically jump to 20mb instantly.  This would take years at predictable growth rates.  Third, while the bandwidth on this particular satellite is small (1Mb/s), satellite internet providers are currently achieving much faster rates (in the neighborhood of 20Mb/s) today.  In a few years, we can expect that to increase as well.  By the time blocks are actually 20mb on average, it's not crazy to assume that bandwidth to these satellites would be upgraded significantly.
Also, if this satellite's hardware becomes outdated, that's the satellite owner's fault.  I wouldn't waste millions on a project that couldn't scale, when future scalability is essential to the mission.

No, it only *looks* like it's "anyone can spend" to non-upgraded nodes.  This is similar to the way p2sh works.  Non upgraded nodes just need some data that hashes to the script hash.  They don't actually see or verify the signatures in the script.  [Please stop spreading FUD.](

If this is actually true, then we can all breathe a sigh of relief.  They will *never* activate, because it is a contenciosu hard fork, regardless of how much mining power they have.  A large majoirty of the community wants nothing to do with buggy BU.

His point is true though.  The longest chain is meaningless if no one values it.
The longest valid chain is what matters.
In the whitepaper, Satoshi only covered the scenario of two valid chains.  He didn't create a section that dealt with chains that have two separate sets of consensus rules.
Essentially what you're saying is that Namecoin should really follow the bitcoin chain because it's the longest proof of work using the same mining algorithm.  Obviously you can see the flaw in that logic.
You're ignoring that chains have different sets of consensus rules.  The longest only matters when adhering to the rules.  Anything else is irrelevant.

Yes, when you fund an opendime, the transaction you sent to it is on the blockchain.
But if you load the opendime up with say $100 worth of bitcoin, then buy something from you friend, and as payment just hand him the opendime, that is a fully offline transaction that took place.
It kind of makes these like a custom denomination dollar bill.  You can give them to someone as payment without actually creating a bitcoin transaction.  The recipient can verify the funds aren't spent because the chip hasn't been popped out yet, so the private key is still unknown to all parties.

Lol.  This statement is absurd.  Bitcoin isn't some fiat currency, where a small board of people just "give it" value.

Then it's dead on arrival.  But there's no evidence to support that they re-wrote segwit in any capacity.
James Hilliard implemented [a segwit activation strategy]( that is fully compatible with the existing BIP9 implementation.
If this is how they do it, there are no issues.  We get Core's version of segwit, unchanged.

Without F2pool, we won't hit 80%.  They're not signaling yet, so this next activation period may not be the one that locks in.

None of this addresses my point. My point is that covert asicboost incentivizes limiting txs. This changes a major mining incentive.
Yes miners are always free to choose how many txs they can put in a block, vut they're financially motivated to include as many as they can.
Covert asicboost kills this motivation, and instead incentivizes the creation of blocks with little or no txs at all.

Not 100% sure.  But I did some basic research and math to figure it out.
A 1 input, 2 output [p2pkh tx is 225 bytes.](
A similar 1 input, 2 output transaction wrapped in a [p2sh transaction is 335 bytes](
So without this native format, all segwit transactions will be have to be in a script, using the p2wsh format.
The difference is 110 bytes: 335 - 225 = 110
About a 33% space savings: 110 / 335 = 0.328358
Segwit does contain some additional overhead, so this might be reduced a little.  But even still, this is not a trivial amount.

Yea but it was released publicly before the coin went live.  Big difference.  
With bitcoin, every user has the opportunity to know the entire lifetime coin supply and distribution rate before investing.

I think he wants an entire 50BTC reward from an early block that has not moved from it's original block reward transaction.
For instance, he would like the owner of [address 1FvzCLoTPGANNjWoUo6jUGuAG3wg1w4YjR]( to send him the 50BTC reward from [this block](  All 50 BTC from that reward remains unspent.  However, this is likely Satoshi's address, since it's the reward from block

This is one scenario. But there are plenty of examples of bitmain making empty or small blocks well after the previous block was found. 
Additionally, there are examples of bitmain making small or empty blocks when they found the previous block, which means they know it's valid, and know which txs it contained.
They employ some very disingenuous and odd mining behavior that no other miner engages in, which leads me to believe they have additional incentives..

The "longest" chain is arbitrary.  The longest *valid* chain is all that matters.  The economy (the users) define what's valid, not the miners.
This explains precisely why BU is not a threat.  No rational miner will fork themselves off and create a &gt;1mb block without overwhelming economic support, which it doesn't have.

It incentivizes blocks with little or no txs. Normal mining would incentivize blocks with lots of txs, to get more reward. 
So yes, Asicboost breaks inherent mining incentives. It is a major security flaw. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:51:17
This happens regularly, every single day.
Here's an example of Antpool doing it under two hours ago:
[Block 473897]( was mined by Antpool.  It was a normal full block (1mb in size).
4 minutes later, which is plenty of time for all miners to have validated the previous block, Antpool mines a small block.  [Block 473898](
5 minutes after that, Antpool miners another small block.  [Block 473899](
Considering that Antpool mined all of those in a row, they really didn't even need any time to validate the previous block, because they were the ones who created it.  But even if they haven't modified their code, and they still do validate previous blocks even if they were the ones who mined it, 5 minutes is plenty of time.  There's no excuse to craft these small blocks.
I completely get the scenario where a miner mines a block seconds after the previous block.  They didn't have time to validate the previous block, or figure out which txs were in it, so they just make an empty block.  That is a very logical use of resources.  What Antpool is going makes zero fucking sense.  This is why I suspect ASICboost.  Their incentives are off.  They wouldn't be leaving free money on the table for any other reason.
What I pointed out is routine, and you can find multiple examples of it every single day.

Yes, this is my point.  Your point is that miners can arbitrarily assign a token value.  You said, "There's whatever value that they give it."  I think that is an insane opinion.  Miners don't create value.


You have it backwards.  The value of a coin comes from the economy.  Who's using it?  What's the value of the open buy orders?  What's the trading volume?  Miners simply follow the most profitable coin.
Miners cannot just split off from a well established economy by changing consensus rules, and think that they will just magically bring that value with them.  If that's what Jihan and Ver think, then I beg them to try.

No, I'm saying that a hard fork has *more* risk than a soft fork.  When the end result is the same, why take the extra risk?  You haven't answered that.  SW as a hard fork doesn't have any additional benefits.  So why take on the extra risk?  Why guarantee a chain split?


It's not a trick.  Old nodes are literally told, "You should really upgrade; there are new rules being enforced that we don't know about.  You have effectively been decreased to SPV-level security".


Not intentionally.  There was never a planned hard fork.  A hard fork has only occurred because of unforeseen events.

I was a little out of the loop on vertcoin.  Did they actually activate segwit via UASF, or did the miners cave and end up activating via MASF?
Either way, it's a big win.  it shows that even the threat of a UASF gets miners to act rationally.

You're missing the point.
This is great as long as your trust the "hub" that is processing your txs in the LN.  But what if he's malicious?
You need to always be able to threaten to broadcast your LN tx to the blockchain in order to keep the hub honest.  Without that ability, you're just dealing with a Paypal type entity who can censor you and stop your payments from going through.
If the actualy bitcoin tx fees get too high, we lose the ability to threaten a bad actor with publishing the tx ourselves.  Who's going to pay a $15 fee for a $10 lunch?  LN then becomes pointless.

The purpose of a full node, from a personal point of view, is to validate your incoming transactions yourself.  You don't rely on miners to do that for you.
If you're running core &lt;13.1, you node will not be able to fully validate segwit transactions.  You will assume they're valid, and rely on miners to do that validation for you.
Likely you'd be fine.  But if a group of miners decided to be malicious, you might follow their chain instead of the honest chain.

ViaBTC and F2pool aren't signaling yet. Neither are a bunch of other small pools.  At the very least, those two need to stay signaling, plus probably one or two others. 
I'd love BIP91 to lock in this week though.  The orphaning of non segwit blocks is going to be damn interesting. I wonder if all pools will upgrade in time, or if someone will actually have their block orphaned. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:52:58
Not for BIP91.  BIP91 signaling needs to hit 80%.  Segwit (BIP141) needs 95%.  Once BIP91 kicks in, the miners will orphan non-segwit blocks, which will force 100% for BIP141.

You're still missing the point.  If it takes more money (bitcoin tx fee) to close the channel than the channel is worth, then that option is taken off the table and they *can* keep your money.  This is the main argument being made.  You keep skipping over this part in your rebuttals.
We get how LN works.  That's all you're describing.  The argument is that if fees get *too* high, it reduces our ability to close the channel.  This needs to be considered when talking about creating artificial fee markets by arbitrarily limiting the blocksize.
There is a happy middle-ground in all of this.  But the LN doesn't replace the need to increase the block size.

It's not reliant on centralized systems.  Bitcoin is self reliant.  I make payments to anyone in the world without any centralized services.  I receive in the same manor.

I've been trying to run some numbers.  ViaBTC's BCC pool is the only miner I've seen that are actually going to mine on the BCC chain.  They represent about 1/5th of 1% of the bitcoin hashrate.
So based on currently difficulty, and a normal ten minute block interval, 1/5th of 1% would mean 5000 minute blocks on the BCC chain (10/.002).
The BCC code will reduce difficulty by 20% after 6 blocks.  At 5000 minutes per block on average, those 6 blocks will take three weeks to produce.  Even then, difficulty would only be reduced by 20%..
This thing might be dead before anyone even finds a single block.

You have a couple options.  First and foremost, I'd always recommend just running a plain vanilla Bitcoin Core node.
If segwit2x is successful, they will orphan non-segwit blocks, and segwit will lock in on all core nodes.
However, if segwit2x fails to gets 80%, you'll just be at the mercy of the miners again..  If you want to attempt to force activation of segwit, then [run a node that enforces BIP148](

There's no need to actually run the segwit2x software.  Just signal on bit4 and bit1 (0x20000012) and you'll trigger the orphaning of non-segwit blocks by those running segwit2x.  That means 100% of the blocks will be segwit, which will trigger lock-in on all core nodes &gt;13.0, and avoid a chain split from the guys running UASF nodes (bip148).
*edit:* I should also note that you must be willing to orphan non-segwit blocks if you're planning on doing this.  You can't build on top of a non-segwit block come August 1st.

The fee rate is determined by the size of the transaction, that is true. But it's all relative. If the supply of block space exceeds demand (blocks that are not full), no one will pay significant fees. So yes, a larger transaction will pay more, but that will still be an irrelevantly small fee compared to Bitcoin.
The bottom line is that no one pays any significant fees on altcoins because there is no demand, and the maximum block size is excessively large. Whenever there is a large supply of something, and no demand, prices plummet. That's just basic supply and demand. 
The miners need to be compensated, or they will leave. They are only compensated today via newly created coins. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that is addressing the future, when the newly created coins are significantly reduced.

BIP91 needs 80% to start orphaning non-segwit blocks.  If you don't signal for BIP91, then you won't count towards that 80%.
However, after BIP91 goes into effect, all pools need to start orphaning non-segwit blocks.  If any miner builds on a non-segwit block, that block will also be orphaned.  So there is a risk of loss of income for any miner that doesn't orphan non-segwit blocks.
This is how segwit gets past the 95% activation threshold.  Since non-segwit blocks will be orphaned, that means that 100% of the blocks will be signaling for segwit.

You're missing the most important factor.  The [stock to flow ratio](
The amount created each day compared to the existing stockpile is the driving factor of a store of value.
The next halving will reduce Bitcoin's stock to flow ratio below gold's.  Once the institutional markets realize this, that's when the paradigm shift into Bitcoin truly begins.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:39:39
I think you're missing one piece.
Come August 1st, the first non-segwit block will be orphaned by the BIP148 nodes.  However, if the segwit miners are not enforcing BIP148, then they will build on top of that non-segwit block.  At this point, UASF nodes will reject that chain because it contains a non-segwit block that was created after BIP148 was activated.
If no miner is enforcing BIP148, then there will be no other chain.
I fully support BIP148.  But we do need at least one miner willing to enforce BIP148.  Without that, there is no other chain.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:42:20
Yes.  They essentially lowered the threshold from 95% to 80% by agreeing to orphan any blocks that don't signal.  This forces 100% of the blocks to be segwit signaling.

OP_RETURN messages can contain 40 bytes of arbitrary data.  If you encode your data and can get the size under 40 bytes, you can store it that way.
I guess you can encode the data, then break up the encoding and store it in 40 byte chunks across multiple OP_RETURN messages.

Because it's completely controlled and operated by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre.  They can change whatever rules they want.  They have demonstrated this by routinely breaking consensus rules, as has Ethereum, BCH, and pretty much every other altcoin that exists.
Bitcoin is the only single cryptocurrency that has routinely demonstrated that it will resist consensus changes, and remain immutable.  This is one of the main reasons why I own Bitcoin.  I know how it will behave in the future, therefore it's a great store of value.  I have no idea how BCH or BSV will behave in the future, because they change the consensus rules so frequently.  That makes it a terrible store of value.


The block subsidy is going to diminish in all coins, including Bitcoin.  That's part of how the supply is released.  Right now, miners are paid with newly minted coins (inflation).  That subsidy gets cut in half ever 4 years.  Bitcoin is the only coin that has a plan to pay the miners once this happens.  Transaction fees will need to be high enough to incentivize miners to continue to mine.  If the blocksize is increased, and there is plenty of room for all transactions, why would anyone pay a fee?  By protecting Bitcoin's 1mb consensus rule, we not only maintain immutability, but this limit creates a fee market, to ensure that miners are still incentivized to secure the blockchain.  The next halving event happens next year.  BCH and BSV are going to lose miners.  Bitcoin is going to gain miners and become ever more secure.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:34:11

Besides Slush, not a single pool that is signaling BU is also signaling segwit.  Additionally, BU software doesn't have segwit implemented.

Thank you! *This* is what we should be talking about.
The devs hard forked specifically to allow *anyone* to spend these outputs.  Then someone spent the outputs and everyone screams "theft".  So the miners 51% attack the chain to reverse the "theft".
I'll give you the real answer though.  They wanted to continue the facade of decentralization.  The patch was already a hard fork. So they could have just hard-coded those UTXOs to only be spendable by a select group.  But that would have been so obvious.  Everyone would have complained about centralized decision making.  So they create the "anyone can spend" patch expecting the top miners to claim the coins and redistribute them.  That way the coins end up with their "rightful" owners, and it looks like it happened in a decentralized manor.
Thankfully, their plan fell apart.  A rogue miner got to them first, and forced them to 51% attack the chain to reverse the tx.  Comical.  At that point, the gig was up, and they had to resort to the centralized redistribution plan that they wanted from the beginning.

Yes there is. That's literally why Satoshi invented the blockchain. Txs are legitimate if they are valid, and can be verified according to the protocol rules. 
Once the miners have control, and only approve certain valid txs based on political positions, then there is no point in having a blockchain. Decentralization is dead. The miners can and will censor txs. Full trust in the miners are then required. They might as well be running an instance of MySQL, and just email out the balances. 
That quote you said has nothing to do with this situation. That refers to *invalid* blocks, meaning blocks that do not adhere to the protocol. Every tx that was reversed adhered to the protocol.

When the blockchain splits, exchanges will likely list both chains.  If the price of bitcoin overwhelmingly dwarfs the price of Jihan-coin, it might be more profitable for some miners to switch back.  So that 90% that initially forks may dwindle.
The market will decide which coin is more valuable, and miners will follow that value.
So the initial percentage of miners who support the fork is irrelevant.  It all comes down to where the value is.

The best case scenario is that miners activate segwit on their own, before August 1st, to avoid having their blocks orphaned.  If everyone acts rationally, and in their own self-interest, this is the expected outcome.  This is what I predict happens.
If this doesn't happen, and the UASF goes through, the next best case scenario is that &gt;51% of the miners enforce BIP148.  This means there is no chain split.  Any miner that doesn't signal segwit will have their blocks orphaned, but they will still see the segwit chain as the longest valid chain.  All miners will switch over fast, and segwit activates.  I would be very happy if this scenario happens, because we get segwit, and no chain split.
The next best case scenario would be that the UASF occurs, but &lt;50% of the miners enforce it.  This will cause a chain split.  In this scenario, if the users really do overwhelmingly support the UASF, that means coins on that chain will trade for significantly higher than the coins on the legacy chain (non segwit).  Miners will switch over because they will make more profit on the UASF chain.  Once it has over 50%, it will overtake the legacy chain and that chain will be reorganized, disappearing.  This may take days to happen though.  I consider this my least favorite of the three.  I do not want a chain split.  I simply want segwit to activate smoothly, and for the community to enjoy the benefits of segwit asap.

Segwit2x signaling is only "intention".  It doesn't actually activate anything.  That software is still being created.
I have my doubts about whether all of the miners actually follow through with it (I'm looking specifically at Bitmain).
Segwit signaling is baked into the software and will actually activate segwit when the 95% threshold is reached.

If so, that's on them.  But bip148 won't cause a fork if it has &gt;50% of the mining power.  That's a fact.

Bitcoin's inflation rate trends toward zero.  Before bitcoin launched, there was no supply at all, so the first year had an immeasurable inflation rate.
Bitcoin's second year had 50% inflation.  The next year had 33%.  Then we had a mining reward drop, then another.
This year in bitcoin, there is roughly 4% inflation.  It will continue to trend downward year after year until it is negligible.  There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin ever created.
The important part of all of this is that it was known in advance.  That's the key difference between bitcoin and ethereum.

Once all miners are signaling segwit, we'll be good.

He's not right.  Running a node requires much more upload and download data than just downloading a 1mb block every ten minutes.
Your node will be connected to dozens of other peers who will all be constantly requesting block and transaction data from you.  Nodes do more than just download blocks when the miners make them.  They also propagate transactions around the network.

The answer is that no one knows.  It's one thing under PoW, it's another under PoS.  PoS isn't here yet, and Vitalik hasn't formalized an answer yet.

The short answer is that bitcoin derives it's value from being immutable. If a small group was able to change a critical consensus rule on a whim, then that coin is not immutable. Anything can be changed by a central team.  You have no guarantee of future rules or behavior. So it's just like fiat money, worthless. 
Also, once the block subsidy diminishes, you need fees to pay the miners for security. The shitcoin forks can only survive now because of inflation, and they have no long term plan to pay for security. The next halving will exemplify this, as they lose a large percentage of their miners.
The long answer is read this book:

Yea, you're right, Antpool is not always signaling.
For instance blocks 472197 and 472193 were mined by Antpool, but do not signal "NYA", but their other blocks do.
I wouldn't be surprised if Antpool backs out at the last minute.
This "NYA" in the coinbase text is irrelevant anyway.  It's just to show intention.  We need to see the block version set to 0x20000012 to actually trigger segwit activation and orphan non-segwit blocks.

That's not a fact at all.  BIP148 doesn't cause a chain split if &gt;50% of the miners enforce it.  BIP148 also doesn't cause a chain split if segwit is already activated by the time it goes into effect.
I'm very much hoping for one of these outcomes, because I *do not* want a chain split.

Garzik's implementation doesn't do anything more or less towards blocking covert asicboost than core's segwit implementation.  He stated as such.
Covert asicboost works by malleating the coinbase text.  With softfork segwit, the coinbase text is reserved for the merkle root of the witness data, making this attack impossible.  This is true in Garzik's implementation as well.
If segwit is implemented as a hard fork, they can just make a new field in the block header for the witness data merkle root, which frees up the coinbase text to use for covert asicboost..

People make mistakes.  Back in 2011, I lost about 4 BTC.  But I'm thankful that I didn't let it keep me down.  I learned my lesson, and moved on.  I continued buying and holding.
So yes, you made a mistake.  More like 3 mistakes.. You left all your savings in a car, with your pin *and* you backup seed all together.  But the bigger mistake would be letting this turn you off to bitcoin altogether, and then you miss out of the *real* action in a few years.  You're going to want a piece of this.
Leasing that Audi is simply a bad financial decision.  You're probably paying at least $300 a month, likely more.  I'd try to get out of that lease, and get yourself a $500 Civic or Camry that you can drive around instead.  Put that ~$300 savings a month into Bitcoin instead.  And this time, memorize your pin.  Keep your trezor hidden in one place, and your seed hidden in a separate place (not your car).

This has nothing to do with my point.  The legal/illegal distinction is meaningless in my book.  The law is not a moral code.  It is largely arbitrary.
The discussion started by someone saying that drug sales are victimless, but gun sales are not.  Essentially, my point is that there is nothing inherently different between voluntary gun sales and voluntary drug sales.  Both are victimless actions.  Both *might* lead to deaths, but if you continually trace an event further and further, every single action in the universe, legal or not, eventually leads to a death.
Consensual sex can lead to a baby, who can grow up to be a bad person who kills someone.  Consensual sex is victimless even though sometimes it leads to murder.
You are trying to say that because someone *might* use an object for a crime down the road, that all sales of all of those objects have victims.  That is patently false.

It's not vaporware, because it actually exists.  All it is, is bitcoin core with some extra signaling.
It actually orphans non-segwit blocks like BIP148 does.  But instead of it being based on a flag day, it's based on miners signaling.
I'm actually pretty impressed that Garzik and Silbert got 80% of the mining power to agree to orphan non-segwit blocks to avoid a chain split on August 1st.
If anything, the whole Segwit2x thing means the UASF was successful.  My UASF node will start orphaning non-segwit blocks come August first, and anyone who's running Segwit2x will be in compliance.

You made two separate claims.  First that lightning still needed another year of development to be "completed" *and* that segwit was necessary.  This is exactly what you said, "it won't be complete for another year and it requires SegWit which also won't happen for a long time."
All I'm pointing out is that your first claim, that another year is needed, is 100% false.  There is already a working implementation.  Segwit is the last piece.  Once it's activated, lightning network will start running immediately.
Last, to address that segwit "won't happen for a long time", I explained that there are two plans being coordinated to have segwit before the end of the summer.  There's no guarantee, but it looks promising.

On to your nukes that you accused me of ignoring.  You want to seriously debate nukes and nuke regulation?  God, this topic sucks because it's so irrelevant and far fetched.  It's the ultimate scapegoat argument.  You should have just said "move to Somalia".  This is going to be short, because I just typed a fucking wall of text in my other response to you.  I'm just going to go over the basics of private free-market nuke regulation.
First let's just acknowledge that it was your idea of society that created nukes.  In an anarcho-capitalist society, creation would come from demand, which would drive profit motives.  There would not have been demand for nukes.  Only states need nukes so they can kill millions at will.
Now you're asking me to solve a problem that governments have created.  Convenient.
Let's just start with the fact that individuals cannot construct nukes.  They just can't.  It takes teams of scientists and engineers with significant ongoing funding for years.  It's just not going to happen, period.  Saying some guy is gonna build a nuke in his basement during his free time is just not a realistic scenario.
It's always taken a large team, a massive organizational structure, and a staggering amount of money to build a nuke. What does that remind you of? Governments.  That's right, the only entities that have ever wanted nukes, created nukes, or sold nukes are governments, the root of all evil.
Nukes will only exist in a free society if there is legitimate market demand for them, because they won't be funded via theft (taxation) like they are today.  Nukes have only ever been created and sold with funds that came from theft.  Remember that.  No legitimate business model would support the massive amount of money that it would take to create, buy and store these things.  There is absolutely no profit, so it is a losing venture.  It's not like a gun either.  It take billions to handle them, store them, protect them, transport them and all for what?  So they can sit in a storage container somewhere?  It'll never happen.  It only happens today because of government.
Legitimate market demand is the most stabilizing force in the universe. Imagine the horror a businessman would feel at even thinking about being in charge of a nuclear project and having it fail. Even if it didn't hurt anyone, the economic cost to him would be incredible. Anyone dealing in private nukes would go to very great lengths to both ensure and insure quality in their product. This differs from national nukes, because the builders and maintainers are spending taxpayer dollars instead of their own money.  Add to that the fact that perpetrators would be held liable in any disaster, and it is clear that market nukes are much, much less dangerous than government nukes if they existed at all.
I admit that I borrowed some of these arguments from someone on These ideas are often debated there.  If you want a better debate where others can join in, I suggest you head there.
I want to apologize if I came off harsh during my arguments.  I get excited and I defend my position passionately.  I don't mean to attack you personally, so I'm sorry if I did.  I tried to keep this short.

Interesting.  Even more interesting is that blocks 0-8 all have the initial 50 BTC balance which were never spent or transfered.  [Block 9]( seems to be the first block where [the recipient]( has actually transferred some bitcoin to other addresses.  Does it seem logical that Satoshi mined block 9?

No, a chain split can occur in a soft fork.  What differentiates a soft fork from a hard fork is whether blocks are valid to old nodes.
In a soft fork, like segwit, the blocks being produced will be seen as valid, even if you're running a 2 year old node.  In a hard fork, the blocks will never be seen as valid to existing nodes.  Every node has to upgrade.

I'm not refusing to answer your question.  Your question is simply invalid.


It does allow for it.  You make it seem like once 75% is hit, the other 25% are barred from signaling.  It does not reject more than 75%.  It will gladly accept it.
Once it hits 75%, it's locked in.  The fork is happening.  However, it may jump to 90% within 30 seconds of locking in.  It's not like that additional mining power is blocked.  They're free to signal for it too.
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:37:08

Democracy and fascism aren't mutually exclusive.  Some would argue that's what we have today.  Democracy is just a popular name for statism.  Yes anarchy is an alternative, I'll get to that later.


No, I use aggression as generally defined; the initiation of force.  It's not rhetoric.  It's literal.  You advocate aggression.  You advocate a world where violence and aggression is the answer to every problem.  You advocate that any idiot has the power to "vote" for master who can then aggress against all he wishes with impunity.  The laws we have are arbitrary rules that largely serve no purpose but to protect the hierarchy.  To protect the corporations, so that they don't actually have to compete in a market.  By advocating democracy, you advocate the aggression that is 100% needed to make it work.


No, however if someone lays a hand on me, that's aggression and I'm prepared to treat aggression with defense, if it's beneficial to do so.  Your "justified" aggression on a massive scale *is* tyranny.


This is just noise.  I don't adhere to any rigid ideology.  I am against aggression, so I advocate a society which I believe the least amount of violence will occur.


Because it deserves more than a reddit comment.  I can tackle this, but I'll do it in another comment.  This one is going to be long enough to begin with.


Do you really not see the blantant and obvious hypocrisy?  Really?  How can you say in one breath that you don't advocate violence, but then in the next say that you advocate violence when some "society" says it's ok?  This is absurd.  My 6 year old could dissect that lame argument.


This is a joke.  Which policy do voters determine?  You're delusional.  Voters are given a fake choice, then our king, who commits murder with impunity, does whatever the fuck he wants.  You have drunk the juice and you truly believe you have a say in the government.  That's nothing short of sad.  You have no say.  Your "choice" is an illusion.  "Society" doesn't make decisions.  Your masters do and under "democracy" you can't do a thing about it.  The state rules you.  The state will parade two options in front of you, and they don't care which you pick.  They've made sure those same two guys want the same thing.  Growth of their power, continued war, and the violent suppression of anyone who disobeys their arbitrary rules..


You advocate a state.  I have based all my arguments on that fact alone.


Lol, it's always "next time".  This form of democracy sucks, but next time will be better! This is the same tired fallacy that communists use.  The fall of the soviet union was because they did communism wrong.   Next time they'll get it right!  Right?  This country started as a very minimal democratic republic.  Probably close to what you seem to advocate.  How long did it take to devolve into this disgusting mess we have today?  Less than 200 years?  There is no "good" democracy.  You hold on to this belief that next time, we'll get democracy right!  Let's destroy the system, then rebuild the same system!  How logical!  The system is broken.  It's inherent.


You, like many, think libertarianism means "DON'T COOPERATE!! YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING ALONE!!"  You're simply wrong.  We just advocate no forced cooperation under the threat of being caged like an animal.  Cooperation is how human beings have evolved this far.  No libertarian doubts that.  However, I believe voluntary associations.  Voluntary cooperation.  This is [how the world works](  This is how things get done.  Spontaneous order.  Dare I say, anarchy (though I prefer the term anarcho-capitalism)?  Governments only get in the way of creation and progress.


Your argument has just devolved further and further from logic.  This is just absurd on every level.  You obviously don't have any clue what libertarianism even means.  Polycentric law would exist without the state monopoly.  Slavery is the ultimate form of aggression and goes against everything libertarians stand for.  No one today would advocate slavery.  A libertarian society's laws would actually reflect the morals of the individuals in that society, not the arbitrary rules of a small group of corrupt politicians.  Remember slavery was only capable because it had state supervision, permission and protection.


Oh man.. The icing on the cake.  You don't have a clue how things work.  The ultra-rich today are enjoying the benefits of state protection.  They own the politicians and they've eliminated competition in their industries.  This woulnd't be possible without special protection from the state.  I wish the "ultra-rich" had to face the wrath of a free market.  They don't.  People like you advocate a system where they get protected by the courts (IP, copyright), and the politicians.  Libertarianism would destroy their limited liability status that has been gifted to them by their cronies.  They'd actually have to compete against competitors.  Shutter!!

If neither of those things happen, then yes, there will be a chain split.

First off, I simply explained how the IRS works.  This has nothing to do with bitcoin.  This is just how governments operate.  Saying this makes bitcoin *less* valuable is like saying that since the IRS exists, that makes cars less valuable, or houses or gold or silver.  That doesn't make any sense.
Bitcoin was developed in part because of the way that governments operate.  It is an alternative currency to help people combat the state in a peaceful way.
Using bitcoin helps people circumvent the violent methods that the government uses to collect taxes, but it doesn't remove the threat of violence that exists.
If bitcoin really becomes big, to a point where 5 - 10% of the workforce is earning in bitcoin, or 25% of businesses accept it (yes I'm completely pulling these numbers out of my ass).  When people live off of it, you can bet your ass that the government is going to try to ban it.  My prediction is that it *will* be illegal to conduct transactions in bitcoin one day.
None of this makes bitcoin *less* valuable to me.  In fact, it makes it more valuable.


They can.  Your identity is never known.  Your IP address may exist and may be linked to a wallet, but there are ways to get around that.  Save your bitcoin in an offline wallet.  Now you have no IP address associated with it.


Yea, but they can already do that with bank accounts today, why would they make it harder on themselves?  To open a bank account you need to give all your info, SS number, photo ID, etc.  The government tracks all of your money and can freeze and raze your accounts whenever they want.  Bitcoin makes that order of magnitude harder to do.  Even if they do get an IP address, courts have already determined in some cases that an IP does not equal a human being.  That might change, but still, that's a great defense from a legal prospective.  You have friends who use your wireless network when they're over your house right?  So how can you prove that your IP was you?  I'm not saying to throw anyone under the bus, I'm just saying from a court of law perspective, your IP doesn't mean you as a person.

I guess technically, they *might* be running it.  But I agree that they likely aren't.
However, they still will count toward the 80% activation that triggers bit 1 signaling on the other miners.  So in that regard it helps with segwit activation.
The only risk they take is on themselves.  In case they build on top of a non-segwit block after the orphaning starts.  That scenario is rare, since the segwit-only chain will be the longest.  But they can also just upgrade before then.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:24:11

I would argue that "libertarianism" is an umbrella term that can mean both minarchism (which is what you've described), and also anarcho-capitalism.  I'm an anarcho-capitalist and I consider myself a libertarian.

If that were actually the case, then yes, I'd be worried.  As it's been pointed out though, this isn't the case.  All they've done is modified a default value in one specific client.  There are many other clients and even if you use this client, you can still change the default value.
They could kill this client tomorrow and bitcoin would still live on.  No one person, or group of people can destroy it.

The bottom line is that people don't want to accept the fact that they love the implementation of "crazy ron paul libertarianz!"
They have been attacking libertarianism for years based solely on false stereotypes, and now that they're faced with the reality that they actually like parts of the ideology, they're having serious cognitive dissonance.
In their minds, they can't justify their hate for "crazy libertarians" while also promoting an agorist, austrian monetary theory.  Instead of accepting the fact that they were wrong about libertarianism, they just want to have all evidence of their mental contradictions removed so they're not reminded of it daily.

First of all, I have no idea what kind of income he was claiming.  It could have been only $20k a year.  Who knows. 
Second, "need" is a very subjective term.  I was making in the $60k range about 7 years ago and I had 2 roommates.  Best decision I ever made.  I was paying close to nothing for rent, and saving money like a badass.
Some people have the mentality that it's normal to spend every penny you earn.  You make $50k, so hey, why not buy a house or rent an apartment on your own?  Well, if you love working forever, and hate saving, then go ahead.
However, having roommates is a very frugal thing to do.  He probably liked living with friends, and it enabled him to save money.  Win-win.

A theoretical bitcoin attack where one entity owns 51% (or more) of all hashing power.  He would be able to double spend his bitcoin and tell his miners to confirm the transactions.
One entity would have to have more hashing power than all miners in the world combined.  I think it's been proven to be impossible at this point.  It would cost billions, and the operation would have to be spread out across vast geographical regions not to overload power grids.
Even if it did ever happen, I believe there are contingency plans in place to figure it out and not trust his version of the blockchain.

No, it doesn't have to.  I believe bitcoins do have intrinsic value though, based on the industrial use and the problems it solves.


Well, the market value of gold is very close to what it actually takes to mine it out of the ground, smelt it, and create polished .9999 rounds.  Also if you compare what an ounce of gold can purchase today to historical buying power, it's slightly undervalued.  I forgot where I read this, but someone made an observation that as far back as the 1600's, a ounce of gold has been able to buy a custom tailored suit.  At ~$1233, that's a little low for a custom tailored suit today, making gold a little *under*valued, historically speaking.


To a degree that makes sense, but the number of current users contributes to the network value.  Sure it *could* be replaced by an alt-coin, but that's like saying that English could be replaced by another, more efficient language.  The number of people using English is partly what gives English value, same as bitcoin.  Convincing those millions of users to use something else is no easy feat.

Listen, I totally get your point and most likely, you're right.  However, the IRS simply doesn't care.  There are so many rules and regulations in place so that they address the issue in any manner they want whether that be capital gains, barter, etc.  Whatever is most beneficial to them is how they'll address the situation.  If they deem that you owe them tax, then they will take your money.  If you don't have any money in an account that they can raze, then they will send you a bill.  If you do not pay it, you'll go to jail.  They don't care if you have to sell your car, sell your bitcoin, or sell you house.  When they demand money from you, you have two options, pay up or get locked in a cage.  If you choose jail as an option, they will still attempt to get that money from you one way or another.

The more confirmations, the more sure you can be that the transaction was legit.  I think 6 confirmations provides over 99.9% certainty.
1 confirmation is fine for casual use.  In order for him to scam you, he would have to have spent that bitcoin, then double spent it by sending it to you, then make sure that his miners confirmed the transactions (since any other miner in the world would reject the transaction), and his miners would have to be running altered code to confirm the double spend attack.
The chance of his miner mining the block that this transaction was part of is extremely low.  I don't know the math, but unless he has a multi million dollar mining operation, the chances are pretty much impossible.

Dispute resolution is an absolutely necessary part of any functioning society.  How it's implemented may vary widely.  I believe today's implementation, where a monopoly (government) controls the whole system is very ineffective.  We routinely lock up peaceful poor people and minorities, while money and celebrity status always buys you a way out.  This behavior is obvious inherent in any monopolistic system.  A private competitive market would weed out bias arbiters and also weed out victim-less crimes, as all crime would have to be reported by a victim.


Lots.  Here's a [wiki page]( that's outlined historical and present forms of non-governmental law and private arbitration.


I would say that Scotland had the best example.  They had a non-governmental private society of clans for centuries.


Many historic and modern democratic governments and dictatorships; Germany during WW2, modern day US, and China are three large glaring examples.  There are countless more.  Google "list of genocides" for a few more examples.


How does this matter?  Regardless, I'm speaking of murder by targeted bombs, drones, guns, gas chambers, missiles and many more.  Modern day US murders peaceful innocent people every single day.  Do you forget about Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  How about Iraq and Afghanistan?


No government does not mean no rules.  I would agree with you that there would be much more chaos if there was absolutely no results for your actions.  However, absent of government, people would still be held responsible for their actions via competitive private defense agencies, private arbitration services, and private law.


You were never brainwashed to pledge allegiance to a flag?  Wow, that indoctrination has been going on for decades in the US.  Every single child must do it every single day for at least 11 years.  You're lucky if you got to escape that.  I know I didn't.  Still creeps me out today to see a room full of hazy eyed kids mindlessly pledging their allegiance in that dull, robotic, monotone group voice.


Again, that may be you, but learning to do that is a basic part of the public indoctrination routines in the US.

I don't understand what your point is or what you're asking.


Accountability to what or whom?


Again, I have no idea what your point is here.
When someone is murdered, there is a clear victim.  Someone is dead.  There is a body, there may be other proof.  Showing evidence of this assault is clear and easy and is done every single day.
When someone is simply moved funds form one place to another, who is the victim?  He is just moving things.  There is no victim.  What has happened is that a group of men with guns have set up an arbitrary rule where if you move money, they demand to be paid a percentage.  Avoiding this theft has now been labeled a "crime", even though there is no victim.  The people who are attempting to commit the crime of theft are labeling people who avoid the theft as "money launderers".  The worst part is that they've convinced billions of people that they're right.  The people who are using violence and theft to steal property are being upheld as the noble government, while the people who hurt no one, use no violence and no theft, and just simply want to move some things around, are labeled "criminals".  What shocks me is that you defend the immoral and try to cage the moral.

But you're talking about a separate action.  Both assault and murder are not victimless.  Those actions have real victims.  However, if a buyer and a seller meet to trade a gun for cash, there is absolutely no victim that results from that action.
If you think the sale of a gun has a victim just because the buyer of the gun *might* commit a crime that involves that gun down the road, then you would also have to say that voluntary drug sales have victims.  You would have to say that the sale of a car has a victim.  The sale of a hammer has a victim.  Hell you would have to concede that birthing a child has a victim.
Obviously you can see that that doesn't make any sense.  Whether the buyer of a hammer uses that hammer to murder someone 3 years after he bought that hammer, that doesn't change the fact that the initial sale of the hammer was a victimless action.  The same thing is true for guns.
Millions of people purchase guns every single year.  In most cases those guns are not used to hurt anyone.  Regardless of whether the guns are ever used in a crime down the road, the initial sale is a peaceful, victimless action.

When people send bitcoin, they may include an optional [transaction fee](  Fees help prioritize transactions.  If you want to get your transaction verified quickly by the miners, offer a higher fee.  Right now fees aren't used too much, because there aren't that many transactions.  Everything gets verified pretty quickly.  When a block is mined, all of the fees that were payed by all of the transactions in the block all go to the miner, in addition to the bitcoin reward.
In the future, when the reward is negligible, or non existent, miners will still mine for the fees.
Most clients use a default fee of .005 including popular sites like blockchain.info.

No I'm in the US.  Real estate in the city is ridiculous.  You can't get anything under $500k and even that is going to be crap.  I'm in a suburb of a large US city on the east coast.  Prices can vary wildly.  I guess I don't know what I can get unless I try, but I doubt I would get even $300k for my place.
Honestly, I'd be extremely happy to even get $260k right now..

Every bitcoin address has a private key.  The private key gives you access to the funds associated with a bitcoin address.
If you generate a wallet on live cd, running on a computer that is not attached to the internet, you can write that private key on a piece of paper.  Then you shutdown the computer.  Now you are the only person in the universe who knows that private key.  It cannot be hacked because it was never on the internet.  It was never stored on a cd or a usb or a hard drive.  It was created in memory on your computer.  Once you shut your computer down that key is lost except for your paper wallet.
To redeem, just import that key.  You can use a number of different downloadable clients, or import it directly into a blockchain.info wallet.  Spend what you want to spend, then send the remaining balance to a brand new paper wallet.

Under most all circumstances I would not care, nor would I go out of my way to check the money before accepting it.  I guess i have one exception.
If I was a merchant and I knew for absolute certainty that some money being given to me was money that was violently stolen from another and I could identify the victim, I would simply not accept that money at the time of sale.  I would ask for a different form of payment.  I would also attempt to inform the original victim.
I do not consider drug purchases, prostitution, gambling, or any other voluntary exchange of property immoral or unethical and I would gladly accept any money that was previously used for those actions.

I agree with this.  The law is not a moral ode though.  Laws are arbitrary.  Laws don't deal with moral and immoral.  Laws deal with the government punishing people they don't like and immorally taking money form innocent people.
You talk about morality, but then defend the government's immoral actions.  The money launderer hurts no one, while the government demands to be paid via threats and force, then locks people in cages who don't pay up.  The government kidnaps, assaults and cages people for growing plants.  The government forced us to fund world-wide murder all over the globe and cages those who refuse to fund the all the death.
The government is the immoral party.  They simply use fancy euphemisms to hide what they're really doing.  When they steal, they call it "tax".  When the kidnap and cage, they call it "arrest and jail".  When you don't pay them their extortion demands, they call you a "tax cheat or avoider".  When you move your money from place to place without paying their arbitrary demands, they call you a "money launderer".  There is nothing moral about their actions at all.


Please.  Historically, there have been private forms of arbitration and retribution all over the globe in many successful civilizations that have no government.  Don't throw your fake history at me.  There would be an overall net loss of murder in this world without the government.  The government is the biggest murderer that exists today.  Can you name another entity that murders more people on a daily basis than a government?
Check out some terms like [voluntaryism]( or [anarcho-capitalism](  Read a book like [*For a New Liberty*]( by Murray Rothbard.  Check out this short video from [*The Machinery of Freedom*](
Don't trap yourself in the sheep-like mindset that there would be chaos without the government.  They've gone through centuries of assaults, murder, indoctrination and brainwashing to get society to think that.  They've had you memorize songs, poems, anthems, recite an allegiance to ever-changing flags, and worship dead rulers just to create a society of obedient drones.  Think outside the box, and read about some real history before we you go chanting how amazing the government is.

The upside of rooting is that you have root access.  The downside is that you have root access to protect.

So you do believe that "some people" should have the right to restrict others with violence, but you choose to wrap up your beliefs in a euphemism called "democracy" so that you can morally justify the violence.  Hiding behind the word "democracy" doesn't change the fact that you advocate aggression against others for the non-violent "crimes" of owning property.


No it isn't.  Who determines this "best interest"?  Society?  Who is this "society" that is capable of making these decisions?  You're using undefined terms about imaginary entities that are incapable of making complex and (lets be honest) impossible decisions about the "collective best interest".  I shutter at these ridiculous terms.  I'm afraid of people who talk like you.  You've described everything wrong with the world today.  This justification you cling to is why our government is so strong, and why it has the ability to murder Americans at will.  This justification is why we spend trillions of dollars perpetrating mass murder all over the globe.  This horrible justification is a mental shield to protect you from the fact that you advocate aggression, violence and murder.  It is a moral illusion that allows you to sleep at night.
Democracy is evil.  Democracy allows 150 million people to vote for slavery and to get it.  Democracy allows the murder of millions.  The Holocaust was democracy in action.  Plus, the fact that you even describe our system of tyranny as "democracy" is just absurd.  We get to "choose" between two groomed puppets who represent the same global interests, and the complete illusion of choice.

You mean 1/8 billionth, which means if you were to split this resource evenly among everyone on earth.  While this isn't realistic in any sense, it does give you a baseline for comparison.
Alone, this comparison is meaningless.  But if you were to assume that 1/8 billionth of gold and 1/8 billionth of bitcoin (both finite resources) should be worth the same, then that would mean that bitcoin is undervalued by $1,049.74.

No.  Fiat basically means "to declare" in latin.  Fiat money only has value because some authority declares it has value and people use it by law.
Bitcoin, in my opinion, has real, intrinsic value.  Let me explain.  The bitcoin network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, payment processing and authorization system.  In the modern world, this network is a *very* valuable tool.  In all of human history, this is the first time it's ever been possible to transfer a currency instantly, across the globe, without the trust of a third party authority.  This network has real value.  Considering that bitcoins are the only currency used on the Bitcoin network, bitcoins too have intrinsic value.
There is no authority that declares bitcoin to have any value, so it is not fiat.

No one here has ever made that claim.  Who are you debating?


No one claims it does.  Linking related subreddits doesn't mean any of this.  This is a straw man fallacy.


No one says that, we would all agree with you.  I think you're just arguing an imaginary man.
However, bitcoin absolutely *is* agorist by nature.  It is absolutely related to Austrian economics.  It is absolutely in-line with anarcho-capitalist ideology.  You can't deny that.  Those subreddits are relevant, and just because they're there does **not** mean that "bitcoin favors some people!!".  It doesn't.  
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:45:43
First off, let me just say that bitcoin is non-political.  That is a fact and I won't disagree with you about that.
However, bitcoin is inherently in-line with the anarcho-capitalist, libertarian (ideology, not political party), and agorist philosophies.  These are not "political" philosophies.  These are alternatives to politics and government.
I think people who don't associate themselves with these terms don't just want to accept it.
I don't see you saying "take r/economics off the side bar!"  Why not?  Saying bitcoin is related to economics is the same thing as saying bitcoin is related to agorism.  It is.  Bitcoin is an agorist solution that is in-line with libertarian and anarcho-capitalist philosophy.  It's just as much related to technology as it is with austrian economics.
I seriously just think that you don't like those terms because of some stereotypes you've heard, and you don't want to believe that you could possibly like something that is consistent with "crazy ron paul libertarianzz!!"
@_date: 2013-03-11 22:53:07
We obviously disagree on an extremely fundamental level.  I believe that no human may restrict the right of another human from the basic ownership of property.
There's something inherently disturbing about advocating the idea that certain humans should have the power to forcibly and violently prevent other humans from simple possession of property, and to have the ability for those "super" humans to act without consequence when forcing their beliefs on others.
I may hold some views that you disagree with, but I would never advocate the use of force against you for not agreeing with me.  Obviously you can't even come close to saying the same.

That's not true.  Yes, they see it as "a manifestation of their ideals".  I agree with you, however they also see it as "a technology that exists in its own right".  These two things aren't mutually exclusive.  Bitcoin is a technological masterpiece that can be and is appreciated for that aspect alone.  However, bitcoin is also a very major step in implementing the ideals of the libertarian, anarcho-capitalist, and agorist ideologies.  Bitcoin can and should be appreciated for that as well.
It seems that you want celebrate the technological aspects and ramifications, but want to deny bitcoin it's libertarian heritage.  I want to celebrate all aspects of it.

Fair has nothing to do with it.  They make money because people are willing to pay them that money.  It's not a centrally controlled thing.  No one sits around and determines that dancers get paid more than laborers.  It's based on supply and demand.   Labor is paid at market rates based on the demand of that labor.  Obviously in our society today, dancing around (in a very specific way) in front of a camera is worth more to our society than simple labor and we're willing to pay more for it.

This is especially true for "safe" areas.  In dangerous areas, criminals don't give a fuck.  A stupid lock isn't gonna stop them.  They'll just smash your windows.  In "safe" areas, these were probably bored 13 year old kids who thought they were tough.  They roam around checking door handles for idiots who leave their cars unlocked and steal simple stuff laying around.  This is actually pretty typical in "safe" suburban areas.  Lock your doors.
