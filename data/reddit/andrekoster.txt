The ECB holds only about 6% of the Greek debt. Less than the IMF (10%).
Most of the debt (60%) is held by Eurozone countries. I live in one of those, and I never had the illusion much of that money would be paid back. It's a lot of money (almost 200 billion euros), but with a population of 340 million, it's not even 600 euro per person. Not exactly the end of the world, I'd say.

Now, this is apples and oranges. When you talk about destroying gold you give the example of dropping it in a volcano (i.e. melting and diluting it such that it becomes extremely difficult to collect it.)
However, when you talk about bitcoin, you give the example of a way to lose your keys.
So if you want to talk destruction, for bitcoin that means destroying each and every copy of the bitcoin ledger that is kept on  5,000+ bitcoin nodes. If you want to talk about losing access to gold, this would be dropping it in sea. Or having a government who confiscates your gold.

I guess you never ran a business. Lets compare it with a consumer in the Eurozone buying an HTC phone at a local electronics store. The HTC phone comes from Taiwan. I'm not sure if HTC demands payment in Taiwanese dollars or US dollars, but it doesn't matter for the example. Point is that the electronics shop sells the phone for euros, and buys it from HTC for (Taiwanese or US) dollars. Clearly, the shop is accepting euros, and it presents an invoice is in euros to the consumer.
Now map Bitcoiner1 to the consumer of the phone, Bitcoiner2 to the electronics shop, and HTC to PapaJohns. And let the pizza be the phone. Then ask yourself if the phone was bought with euros or dollars.

It's besides the point, since the controversy is about creating a shortage of block space or not. Postponing the moment this shortage comes into existence is not in the interest of those who want this change in the way Bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:38:40
Okay, so you agree with my first point. Regarding my second point, we're on the same page -- gold has *some* utility (but that doesn't justify its high price).
Regarding the third point, indeed, Bitcoin can theoretically be changed to allow more bitcoin to come into existence. However, this is in nobodies interest, and hence, will never be accepted. Even something like the max. block size, of which almost everyone agrees that it has to be increased, is difficult to change. Let alone the 21 million limit.
Of course, a smaller no. of units doesn't make one cryptocurrency better than another.

That's a pity, because the author is right. The Bitcoin difficulty is adjusted every two weeks. This summer the increase of the hashing power was so big, that the difficulty was lagging behind continuously. There have been weeks that the average block time was down to 7 min, instead of 10. That means 40% more coins than planned. Of course, in the long run it doesn't matter. Thanks to this acceleration, the next block halving will not be at the beginning of 2017, but at 2016-07-31 11:23:56 UTC (according to the Bitcoin Clock,  ). Bottomline line is that the author is correct if he says that this year there was an increased rate of supply.

Great service, and wonderful if you have no other option. However, when I wanted to top my Malaysian number with 30 ringgit, I was about to be charged 0.02221833 BTC or USD 11.10. That's 35.94 ringgit, or almost a 20% markup. (Same goes for a RM 50 top-up, that will set me back RM 59.25. So the 20% markup seems constant.)
Of course, they should be able to make money on offering the service. But 20% feels like too much.

Of course I'm talking about the initial situation where the overall enterprise is making a loss, but switching off the machines would only create a bigger loss (read: mining still yields more than just the cost of only the electricity). Unless you decide to round up your enterprise, it doesn't make sense to quit mining, yet.






You make a very complicated calculation to show that the revenue is proportional to the BTC price: $75 revenue @ a BTC price of $300 means $30 @ a price of $120 (120/300x75). This has *nothing* to do with miners dropping off.
 


You are twisting it. A block time of a week is the *result* of the domino effect you assume. I say the domino effect will not come into effect. Hence, if a few miners stop, the block time will only increase a little (1, 2, 4 minutes?). It will not increase suddenly from 10 minutes to one week and then induce the domino effect.
I stand by my claim that a few miners quitting won't make many others (i.e. more than half) do the same and hence, doesn't invoke a drastic increase of the block time to hours or days.

How does this relate to a deposit for a B&amp;B? We can assume that both the host and the guest trust AirBnB (they do now, so no reason why they wouldn't when paying with bitcoin). The host demands a deposit from the guest while staying, which makes only sense if it's a considerable amount. After all, it should be enough to cover for potential damages caused by the guest.
Currently, the guest allows AirBnB to claim the deposit on the guest's credit card which is reverted 24 hours after the end of the stay, unless the host claims damage. If all goes well, the guest notices little of this. But when using bitcoin, the guest would be required to actually send the deposit to AirBnB for the duration of his stay. Money he can't use during that time.

No, they are not. Adding more computing power to the Bitcoin network in China makes that a larger share of the daily quotum of 3,600 bitcoin go to China. But globally, it's still about 3,600 a day. Hence, it doesn't really effect the price of bitcoin.

However, most of the dispute is regarding short term behavior ("While mainstream economists agree that the quantity theory holds true in the long run, there is still disagreement about its applicability in the short run."). So most agree that for the long run the theory holds. And in the discussion here about the price development of bitcoin, we are discussing how it will develop in the long run.
Regarding how testable the theory is, I quote Friedman regarding this, who claimed that "empirical studies have found relations consistent with the models above and with causation running from money to prices".
One thing is sure though, the author didn't make the jargon up himself, but scientists from Copernicus to Friedman did.

So if you rely on insured bank accounts, take a look at the size of the banking sector in the country in question compared to its GDP. You'll be surprised.
On the other hand, Circle is one of the few bitcoin banks that is privately insured (by one of the biggest insurer in the US).

True, and if I'd be in a hurry, I surely would. However, the fee is less at Kraken. But apart from the fee, my selling price at Localbitcoins is based on the Kraken BTC rate. I can't use the Bitonic rate as input. By using Kraken I minimize the volatility risk.

"deflationary economy would give far, far more power to the wealthy than they already possess."
Currently, the wealthy don't keep (much) of their capital in fiat money, because then it melts away. So they invest most of it, in order to get on average a 4% return on investment. With a deflationary currency it becomes less expensive to keep a part of your capital as money. A sustainable growth rate for a developed economy is about 1%. Which would mean a deflation rate of 1%. It means that storing capital as money won't cost you 6% (4% of missed ROI and 2% inflation), but only 3% (4% of missed ROI, compensated by 1% deflation). It will still encourage capitalists to invest, but they can take it more easy to find proper investments -- it will lead to better investments and less waste of capital. Does this mean the wealthy get more power? Or will rents be higher? Why would wages be lower?

I concur, I trade on Bitstamp as well as Kraken, and the latter is better. Better, because of the multi tier KYC approach. It's cheaper (fees of 0.2% or less). And you can trade in Euros, which avoids the 0.5% exchange fee that Bitstamp charges for exchanging Euros to Dollars. The cherry on the pie: withdraws are only 9 eurocents (Bitstamp: 90).

Once merchants have introduced it, they will not take it off since it doesn't cost them anything. On the contrary, every single customer that pays with bitcoin, means less costs, less risk. So there's only one way forward, which is that ever more merchants will accept it, especially webshops. 
Next, it is only a matter of time until enough merchants accept it for competition to start. And the initial low volume of bitcoin sales make that even easier, as not much revenue needs to be sacrificed in order to say "We at XYZ give 2% discount when paying with bitcoin!". It will start a race to the bottom.

I misread an essential part ("readjust for 2016 blocks" I read as "readjust before 2016" -- the year, that is). I stand corrected.
The cost of mining BTC is only for a part electricity. Switching off your machines doesn't halt your hardware write off, your rent, other fixed expenses for your business infrastructure, nor your employees (if you have them). Also, for an individual miner the chances of finding the next block stays the same. the fact that some other miners switch off their gear doesn't make it more difficult. The difficulty stays constant until the next (downwards) adjustment. You assume that slightly longer block times will make the BTC exchange rate go down. (We have seen the opposite didn't make the rate go up this autumn!) Hence, the domino effect you describe is based on an assumption, which I think is not correct.

I stand corrected, the money supply could keep up with the economic growth resulting (on average) in neither deflation nor inflation. 
I quote "Capital in the 21st century" of Thomas Piketty, p.146-148:
The Great Monetary Stability of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries 
To back up a bit: the first crucial fact to bear in mind is that inflation is largely a twentieth-century phenomenon. Before that, up to World War I, inflation was zero or close to it. Prices sometimes rose or fell sharply for a period of several years or even decades, but these price movements generally balanced out in the end. This was the case in all countries for which we possess long-run price series. 
More precisely, if we look at average price increases over the periods 1700–1820 and 1820–1913, we find that inflation was insignificant in France, Britain, the United States, and Germany: at most 0.2–0.3 percent per year. We even find periods of slightly negative price movements: for example, Britain and the United States in the nineteenth century ( − 0.2 percent per year if we average the two cases between 1820 and 1913).
The gold value of the franc set in 1803 was not officially changed until June 25, 1928, when a new monetary law was adopted. In fact, the Banque de France had been relieved of the obligation to exchange its notes for gold or silver since August 1914, so that the “franc-or” had already become a “paper franc” and remained such until the monetary stabilization of 1926–1928. Nevertheless, the same parity with metal remained in effect from 1726 to 1914—a not insignificant period of time.
We find the same degree of monetary stability in the British pound sterling. Despite slight adjustments, the conversion rate between French and British currencies remained quite stable for two centuries: the pound sterling continued to be worth 20–25 livres tournois or francs germinal from the eighteenth century until 1914. 28 For British novelists of the time, the pound sterling and its strange offspring, such as shillings and guineas, seemed as solid as marble, just as the livre tournois and franc-or did to French novelists. 29 Each of these units seemed to measure quantities that did not vary with time, thus laying down markers that bestowed an aura of eternity on monetary magnitudes and a kind of permanence to social distinctions. 
The same was true in other countries: the only major changes concerned the definition of new units of currency or the creation of new currencies, such as the US dollar in 1775 and the gold mark in 1873. But once the parities with metal were set, nothing changed: in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, everyone knew that a pound sterling was worth about 5 dollars, 20 marks, and 25 francs. The value of money had not changed for decades, and no one saw any reason to think it would be different in the future.

Governments shouldn't change (tax)rules retroactively. Whether tax should be collected automatically is a matter of debate. It happens in more cases.
Regarding taxing never made gains, the Dutch tax rules has special solution for that. All capital and assets above 20,000 euro are expected to gain 4% per year. This amount is taxed, no matter if in your particular case it gained more or less than 4%. The idea behind it is that it's often difficult to calculate the exact gains, and that 4% (roughly 2% higher than inflation on average) is a reasonable assumption.

You really have to take the whole chain into account. Why do prices go down in the first place? Because of increased productivity. Theoretically, this increased productivity can be used between two extremes. One is that a larger quantity of goods or services is produced and/or the quality is improved (e.g. 4K TVs instead of HD TVs). The other end of the spectrum is that people just work less. Let's look at the latter situation. People work less, get paid less, and spend less on cheaper goods and services. At the other extreme, prices remain te same, wages stay the same, laborers work the same time, but they get either get more goods and services and/or more fancy ones.
In reality, we see it's a bit of everyting: more and better goods and services, and we work a bit less.

And that money is bitcoins. Take away their bitcoins, and those servers will be switched off in no time. The currency and the Blockchain technology cannot be separated.

"One could sense from the question-and-answer session that followed that this is where Silbert loses most of us. What, exactly, will be the catalyst that nudges us toward buying stuff with bitcoin rather than dollars?"
I don't understand why this is so hard to explain. The answers are...
1) Online shopping that is currently being done by credit card and PayPal. Once there are enough merchants accepting bitcoin, competition will start. Meaning that part of the savings (the difference between 3% credit card fees + charge back risks, compared 1% bitcoin/bitpay fees) shall be given to the consumer. Once the consumer can choose between the normal price with credit card, and 2% less with bitcoin, many will opt for bitcoin.
2) International money transfers. Using traditional banks to transfer money from one currency area to another is slow and costly. E.g. I regularly send money from the Netherlands to Malaysia. Using the banking systems means a fee of 7 euro, an exchange rate of 1-2% below market rate, and a 3-4 day delay. Nowadays I do this with bitcoin. It's still a bit of a hassle to find Malaysian buyers for my bitcoins, but it's much cheaper (no fees) and much faster, usually just a few hours to do the whole transaction. If a company would streamline this, nobody will use a bank anymore.
3) Porn. Just like with video rentals in the '80s/'90s, this will prove to be the killer app. Many people who pay for porn don't like to leave traces on their credit card statements. Nor do they want to trust shady porn websites with their credit card credentials out of fear for abuse. Imagine having to file a complaint with your bank against a porn site that charged you more than they should have. That would embarrass many, and hence, many will shy away. Bitcoin solves all this. It's just one time, no traces left. Once the porn industry discovers they will attract shy clients they didn't reach until now, they will all offer payment via bitcoin.

The author didn't say the fundamentals guarantee that bitcoin is going to be worth a significant amount of money. He simply tries to make a prediction based on a model, and makes a number of assumptions. And sure, some alt coins share the same fundamentals. But unless they bring a clear improvement to the table, they can't beat Bitcoin's first mover advantage. Just sharing the same fundamentals but without all the infrastructure Bitcoin already has in place is not going to cut it.

"it" refers to bitcoin, the currency. Not Bitcoin, the protocol. I agree that the protocol has a certain value for society (just as the Internet protocol has a certain value). And yes, there's a link between the two (the Bitcoin protocol is a prerequisite for the bitcoin currency to be able to exist). But I don't see why bitcoin not being a traditional currency would render existing currency models invalid. If you think you can falsify the model the author uses, please do.

Makes sense. Regarding  you would expect bitcoin to overpriced in rubles. Yet on BTC-e at this moment, the going rate for 1 BTC is USD 320 and RUR 20,800. The latter is currently USD 298. So if you buy your bitcoin with rubles, you get a $22 dollar *discount*. So much for a serious premium!

Except for Americans, I don't see the point. We already have mBTC and µBTC (currently worth about half a dollar and one-twentieth of a dollar cent). The latter may not be useful yet, but will be once BTC becomes more valuable.
I have not seen many people mix up meters, centimeters and millimeters. So why would they mix up bitcoin and millibitcoin? And most likely, when bitcoin becomes truly popular, people will start to refer to mBTC as 'millis', just as they refer to kilograms as 'kilos'.
Bottom line, for people used to the International System, the Greek prefixes mega, kilo, centi, milli, etc. are quite obvious. Isn't bitcoin meant to be international?

If there's insufficient demand for the Bitcoin network, it's inevitable it will get weaker. Miners need to be paid. And if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.
If Bitcoin is successful, more and more tx will be done. If the blockreward gets too little, miners well get picky about the tx they include in their blocks, driving the tx fee up. 
It's hard to predict how fast the number of tx will rise. Anyone who can't even live with that uncertainty, shouldn't put any money in BTC in the first place.

What is needed is not necessarily a discount, but a *difference*. The costs of a payment method should be put at those who enjoy the advantages of that method. Hence, if a credit cards allows for charge backs, delayed payment, etc, why not put the costs for those services where they belong, i.e. the users? 
If competition is fair, this differentiation will happen sooner or later. And then we'll find out if the average consumer finds the prices difference compelling enough.

While many places absorb the credit card fees, some chose to bill the customer for them. Either way, they are still credit card fees. I actually prefer merchants who charge you for the costs involved instead of socializing them over all their customers.


When it comes to small payments, a wallet on a phone is good enough (and safer than a wallet on a PC, mind you!). At a broker like bitonic.nl everyone can buy bitcoin for a good price in a few mouse clicks. So yes, saving 5% on your bill each in every time is worth that effort.


I mentioned bank transfer, because that's what I would have used if not for Bitcoin. They also accept Paypal. The company I work for recently received a Paypal payment from a foreign client who didn't like to wire money (too complicated), the costs to receive it were a whopping 5%.
Seriously, if you want to use Bitcoin to payments, use a mobile wallet like Mycelium or Breadwallet, write down the seed and store it safely. If you want to use Bitcoin to store a lot of money, use a paper wallet, a Trezor or BitGo. It's not that complicated, really. And if you want buyers protection because you don't fully trust the merchant on the internet you're buying from, use a credit card.

There is no question of how to reward miners at Bitcoin end game. Miners will be rewarded with transaction fees. Lets say currently these are about 0.125 BTC per block. The block reward tops this up to 25.125 BTC. Apparently, the current group of miners can do the job for that money. So in the end game, 25.125/ will be the tx fee. Hence, with the same  we'll end up with a high fee 200 times as high as currently. Or we will have 200 times as many tx in a block (max block size of 200 MB?) Or, the third parameter, the number of miners will shrink with a factor 200. 
The outcome will be determined by how much demand for bitcoin tx there is, how much people are willing to pay as fee, and how much revenue miners need to break even. An equilibrium will emerge -- pushing it in one direction with an artificial max blocksize is neither needed nor desirable.

I agree that if you enjoy the protection of the possibility of charge back, that is a valid reason to be ok paying a little more. Do note that in much of Europe, the situation is a different one. With the exception of the UK, credit cards are not the norm. Many EU countries have extensive giral payment systems in place, that have extended to internet payments. E.g. in the Netherlands, the most populair payment method people choose is iDeal. It doesn't do charge back, but I've never noticed this to be a problem. Merchants do pay for iDeal, and in some cases will forward these costs to the customer. 
Take for instance Thuisbezorgd.nl (a food home delivery service). Use iDeal, and you pay 1 euro extra. Use Bitcoin, you pay no nothing extra. I don't think that if something goes wrong with the delivery, they will give you less service because of the way you paid. My conclusion is that anyone who has Bitcoin, will favour it to order at this particular merchant over iDeal. And I didn't even mention that it's easier and faster too...

No, you have to take the size of the economy into account. If an economy grows with e.g. 10%, and the money supply stays the same, then there's 9% deflation. 
To make it even more obvious, imagine that the population doubles. Then the economy doubles, too. If the amount of money stays the same, everything needs to be half the original price. Hence, with a fixed money supply, 100% growth results in 50% deflation.

It doesn't assume that at all. At some point, the possibility is discussed what would happen if 1% of all trade would be done with bitcoin. That's a far cry from 100%.
Saving transaction costs is far from the only  driver for using bitcoin. Being able to make a purchase on the Internet (see the story of the guy from Ghana whose VISA card would not be accepted), being able to send a small amount cross border without large fees (remittance, tipping and donations), or simply being able to store money for the unbanked.
Sure, Bitcoin's ease of use still has a lot room for improvement. But it's work in progress, and we're getting there.

How accessible an exchange is for fiat money is very important for users, as it is the bottleneck for exchanging bitcoin (regarding both time and fees) . Most fast payment systems are organised on a national level. Hence, for any national market that's big enough, there's room for a local bitcoin exchange to grow and prosper.

Let me draw a parallel that to make it more clear.
Many discoveries and inventions are indeed made while scientists were looking for something else entirely.
However, internet is not a scientific discovery, it is an engineering artifact. In engineering, one chooses a well-defined purpose, then puts together the parts and processes that best achieve that purpose. An engineer does not spend two years designing and optimizing an airliner in all details, and, when it fails to fly, tries to use it as a submarine.
The Internet's TCP/IP, DNS, and all other features of the protocol are what &lt;insert your favourite internet engineer here&gt; thought were the best choices to achieve the intended purpose, namely a data routing method without central management etc.. If the purpose is going to be redefined as something else -- VoIP, secure websites, video streaming, whatever -- then one should state clearly the new purpose, and design the best possible system to achieve that purpose, from scratch. Not ask around "what are the applications of the Internet's TCP/IP".

Capital (and money is a form of capital) has the tendency to concentrate in the hands of a few, the 1%. Read Thomas Pikkety's "Capital in the 21st century" if you want to know how this works. Nowadays fiat currency is inflationary. Hence, rich people will not keep large amounts of money, since it it will melt away due to inflation. With bitcoin, once the inflationary phase is behind us (the current bitcoin inflation is 10%!) bitcoin will become deflationary. Then I expect rich people to be less in a hurry to invest their money. 
So yes, relatively more bitcoins will stay in the hands of the 1%, compared to fiat money. On the other hand, investments will be done more carefully (and hence, with a better ROI), because capitalists are not as much in a hurry to invest their money.

Since Bitcoin is modeled after gold, it's a lot like gold. Of course, there are differences. But the similarities are bigger, IMHO.


Not into existance, but you can try other existing materials to function in the same way, like palladium or platinum.


That's one of the differences. On the other hand, an actual transaction (esp. large ones) can be obfuscated far easier than with gold.


That's another difference. Although not at the most minimal of levels, you can still sign transactions without the Internet. On the other hand, our Internet is just as fragile as our electricity grid, our transportation system, and our labour division. So the added vulnerability is rather limited.

The way I understand it, letting the mining process piggy-back on the main process (whatever that may be) will generate tiny amounts of BTC without adding much to the electricity usage. So a TV could be generating BTC on the side while watching TV, and that BTC can be used to pay Netflix. 
It only makes sense if there's indeed a synergy between mining and the graphics function of the TV.

* Voipbuster.com charges €0.50 for bank or credit card payments, but only €0.05 for Bitcoin payments. (I typically buy €10 of calling credit)
* Thuisbezorgd.nl (a food delivery portal) charges €1 for bank or credit card payments, but nothing for Bitcoin payments
* My email provider runbox.com would have to wait two working days if I'd pay them by bank transfer. With Bitcoin it was about one hour (if you count six confirmations).
Cheaper and faster:
* If I send money to Malaysia, I can use my bank  and it will take 3 working days and cost me €7 + 1% of the amount sent; or I use Bitcoin and it will take me a few hours and cost me nothing.
I guess the banking and credit card fees are cheaper in the US -- I dunno. I pay a flat fee according to the package I chose. And a package with CC is more expensive than one without.
For the retailer, the fees of Bitpay or Coinbase are way lower than MasterCard or Visa. For bank transfers, it depends on your volume. I know that the simplest pay-per-transaction (without subscription fee) costs between €0.50 and €1 per transaction, depending on your payment processor.

I agree, people enjoying a well functioning financial infrastructure have little incentive to use bitcoin as long as the merchants don't share their bitcoin advantage more with the consumers.
However, there are plenty of other situations and places where you don't need those incentives. Like the husband that wants to buy porn on xHamster but doesn't want to use his credit card. Or the Nigerian whose Nigerian credit card is not accepted by a US online merchant. Or the Filipino migrant worker who wants to send money home. Or me, who wants to transfer €260 to my Malaysian bank account but doesn't want to pay €8 for the privilege and wait 3 days for it. 
And as more merchants will start to accept bitcoin, more competition will arise leading to more discounts for bitcoin users. Mark my words.

Firstly, one should minimize trusting non-banks with your money (BTC or fiat). But if you want to exchange BTC for fiat economically, you have little choice other than to pick an exchange and trust it. However, you minimize the risk by looking at

2) Is there decent contact info on the site (address, phone number)
3) Is it clear who runs the company? Who are the owners of the company?
4) What are the experiences of other people with the site? How is its reputation?
Finally, you should keep the amount of BTC and fiat you keep on the exchange as small as possible. For BTC there is little excuse anyway, unless you want to engage in day trading. Within an hour you can move your BTC back in the exchange. Fiat is more an issue, since that takes at least a day to transfer it to an exchange.

Come on, everybody has two options (actually three), keep your own keys, or use a hosted wallet. And with the latter, you can opt for multisig (like BitGo). If you want to keep your own keys, at least don't store or use them on a Windows PC. Take a Trezor. Or a Case Card. Or a simple paper wallet.

I don't see the problem with miners being rewarded with transaction fees. Lets say currently these are about 0.125 BTC per block. The current block reward tops this up to 25.125 BTC. Apparently, the current group of miners can do the job for that money. So in the end game, 25.125/ will be the tx fee. Hence, with the same  we'll end up with a high fee, 200 times as high as currently. Or we will have 200 times as many tx in a block (max block size of 200 MB?) Or the number of miners, the third parameter, will shrink with a factor 200.
The outcome will be determined by how much demand for bitcoin tx there is, how much people are willing to pay as fee, and how much revenue miners need to break even. An equilibrium will emerge -- pushing it in one direction with an artificial max blocksize is neither needed nor desirable.

I sell BTC on LBC every now and then, and so far I've only encountered one incident. The person hardly spoke English and signaled to have paid while it wasn't the case. He needed some convincing (I said I would start a dispute) for him to cancel the trade.
If you don't have feedback, yet, perhaps it's better to do one or two small trades to get at least some feedback before you place an ad. Having said that, reputation matters more for the fiat-party of the trade, as they could try to reverse a transaction. The BTC-party can't, as LBC keeps the coins in escrow.
Of course, never accept fiat payments that are easily reversable, like PayPal or cheques that aren't guaranteed. I accept instant bank transfers and ATM cash deposits, never had a problem with those.

Try to stay away from hosted wallets, and definitely stay away from hosted wallets that don't give access to your keys (Coinbase, Circle, exchanges), other than using them as a stop-over. For saving larger amounts, use paper wallets or a Trezor instead.
For day-to-day payments, use a mobile wallet, like Mycellium (Android) or Breadwallet (iOS). Make sure you write down the seed and store it safely. Put a PIN on the app or on sending bitcoin. (Mycellium has the added feature that you can use it to easily spend from a paper wallet.)

I'm not sure if bitcoin the currency is the killer app for Bitcoin the technology. I have the feeling it's more like Internet's email. The first, most obvious application, and it will stay with us, and everybody will use it. But, like email, it's not something that delivers something that is not already possible. I can send funds immediately across the world if I pay WU handsomely. I can do it from my bank account if I don't mind waiting a few days. I can make pretty easily payments in the Internet nowadays. It's a little less user friendly, there's fraud, but generally it works well. The number of uses for bitcoin the currency that are truly new are still very limited (I'm thinking pay for view or per use, tipping, charities).
How the killer app for Bitcoin the technology will look like, remains to be seen.

I have no clue why there was a bitcoin price crash last weekend, although like OP I suspect it might be driven by Chinese who now think it's more profitable to trade on the stock exchange. It wasn't crashed by the theft of Bitstamp, since all stolen coins are still sitting nicely in the hackers wallet. I take it the hacker waited for a sudden price drop, knowing it would result in a lot of people sending bitcoin to Bitstamp, making their hot wallet holding a lot of bitcoin. And hence, maxing out his theft.

The pieces of data that we call bitcoin have value because they are hard to discover, cannot be faked, and are limited in number. Hence they are scarce. Gold works in the same way. It's hard to extract it out of the Earth, you can't fake it, and its scarce. Once enough people see that (that goes for gold, but just as well for bitcoin), it becomes desirable and hence valuable.

The banks are "working" hard to increase their buffers. Note, doubling the banks buffers means that half of the actual money supply disappears. This is what is causing the deflationary pressure in the Eurozone. So the banks first priority is to replenish their buffers with the QE money, which until now they could only achieve by increasing their profit margins and not lending out to businesses. 


I doubt it. I think the individuals would use it mainly for consumption. It would be good for businesses, it would increase inflation, but the banks would still be stuck and not lend out money. Note, we are still paying back for the pre-2008 lending bubble. This is not about helping the people. This is about helping the banks.
BTW, the population of the Eurozone is 334,570,678.

Indeed. But with Bitcoin we're not yet quite there, yet. We are in the pioneering stage where a small group of people see the potential of a new technology, but it hasn't the efficiency to practically use it on a large scale. Like the concept of a personal programmable device is awesome -- but what are you going to do with it? (My first three programs I wrote were 1) control logic for a coffee machine 2) solving 2nd degree equations and drawing them on the screen 3) an address book.)
With the Internet it was awesome to be able to remotely access another computer, or to transfer files from that computer to yours, or send a message to a user on that other computer. But it had no use for ordinary people at all.


As long as merchants don't share their savings with the consumer, the latter has no incentive to pay with bitcoin (note, a very few *do* already share). Currently, there are only a handful of use cases where bitcoin gives you some advantage.
- Paying for services where you don't want to give your name or CC (think porn)
- Paying for services where your CC is not accepted (think non-US credit cards not being accepted by US merchants, happened to me a couple of times)
- Sending money internationally, which is now either slow or expensive (take your pick)
- Paying for services without subscription (like pay-per-view for movies, or this internet phone booth  )
- Paying small amounts (think donations or tipping)

It will get easier. Computers got easier (remember Basic?), Internet got easier (remember WinSock and PPP?). So will Bitcoin.


The WWW came later on the Internet, and was indeed the killer application that convinced even the most conservative people. Before that moment, the gratification had to come from being able to send an email, or to control another computer remotely. Just as I currently get excited about sending value instantly to a remote country, or about buying something on the WWW without the need of a bank or credit card company. I'd like to stress that the equivalent of the WWW killer app for Bitcoin isn't here, yet.


A smartphone is simply a pocket PC that is a mobile phone as well. It's not revolutionary, it's simply an optimization of not having to carry around two devices.


Same was true for PCs in 1980 and the Internet in 1990. The masses ignored it, they didn't need it, it was expensive and difficult. It didn't really bring you much apart from the intrinsic excitement. The first real use case for a PC was the word processor (WordStar). In 1980, 5000 people had purchased a copy of WordStar. By 1983, that number rose to 650,000. That may be close to the number of active Bitcoin users right now. The first real use case of the Internet was email. But it was hard to use, expensive if you were on a dial-up phone connection, and few people could be reached by email. But if you wanted frequent communication with someone abroad, it was awesome. Kind of like how remittance is currently awesome with Bitcoin. Difficult? Yes. Nice market? Sure. But more use cases will follow, mark my words.


That is totally true, of course.

Indeed, that's a big threshold to cross. What's needed are local exchange sites in each currency area where you can straightforward exchange BTC for the local currency and back. These should operate the local way of fiat money transfer. E.g. in the Netherlands Bitonic is such a service (there are a couple of them), and they use the national iDeal payment system.

Indeed, the fiat-to-fiat market is much bigger. That's why it is so smart! Let Circle be the customers' BitPay. If that leads us to lower payment fees, that's great.

Small correction: take $100, and $200 as a second price, then price *is* 200% of initial price; and the price is 100% *up*. (Compare, when a price rises from $100 to $101 you don't say it's 101% up. It's 1% up.)
So, a 50% dip from B to A is the same as a 100% rise from A to B.

Users will be incentivised once miners don't pick up transactions with too little fees. Currently the block reward is still so big, and the number of transactions still so small, that one dwarfs the other. But over time, the block reward becomes smaller and smaller, while the usage will increase. Then, the miners will start paying more attention to how much fees users pay.

What do you mean with that? The only incentives I experienced were
- Allowing for an easy way to make a deposit (e.g. for renting a car).
- Making international online shopping possible.
- Being able to pay abroad without local cash currency.
For the rest, I dislike credit cards. I dislike that they try to seduce you to use it as a credit line (horrendously expensive). And I dislike the upwards pressure of prices that they cause. The percentage that the merchant has to pay has to be compensated for somehow. For that reason, I'll use credit cards is little as possible. But online internationally, you don't really have much choice.

Bitcoin is not compelling in countries with unstable currency if a) their unstable currency is still more stable than bitcoin (e.g. Rubles) or b) there are enough dollars or euros around to switch to.

Sorry for double posting, but my reply is more in place here.
I don't see the problem with miners being rewarded with transaction fees. Lets say currently these are about 0.125 BTC per block. The current block reward tops this up to 25.125 BTC. Apparently, the current group of miners can do the job for that money. So in the end game, 25.125/ will be the tx fee. Hence, with the same  we'll end up with a high fee, 200 times as high as currently. Or we will have 200 times as many tx in a block (max block size of 200 MB?) Or the number of miners, the third parameter, will shrink with a factor 200.
The outcome will be determined by how much demand for bitcoin tx there is, how much people are willing to pay as fee, and how much revenue miners need to break even. An equilibrium will emerge -- pushing it in one direction with an artificial max blocksize is neither needed nor desirable. I agree with Gavin, we'll deal with it once we know where it's heading.

At the surface this argument makes sense. But we know that a metal like gold is just a particular configuration of protons, neutrons and electrons. Change the configuration, and you got something else. In that sense, gold's configuration of particles is just as arbitrary as bitcoin's configuration of digits. The value of gold is based on the difficulty of changing that configuration (changing lead into gold). With bitcoin it's exactly the same, it's based on the difficulty of cracking the crytography.


The amount of bitcoin can also not be increased. It will never exceed 21 million. Yes, you can creat a clone of bitcoin (see the hundreds of altcoins that already exist). But you can also chose any other rare metal next to gold, e.g. like platinum. In both cases, you see that network effects make it very difficult to become a succes.

I do about 20 tx per month. I think there are about 1 million Bitcoin users out there. So that would be 20 million tx per month (4,600 per 10 minutes) if everyone would use Bitcoin like I do. The fact that's almost triple the current capacity of 1,700 tx/block indicates that others use Bitcoin much less, or that there are much less users than 1 million.
That some wallets predict fees doesn't increase capacity. It only informs the user of (likely) required fees, and may convince him to postpone or cancel his tx.

No, the sole purpose of the limit was to prevent spam transactions. A fee market will develop anyway once the block reward becomes too small. Another way to stop spamming would be a minimum fee (like Litecoin has).

@_date: 2016-03-04 17:46:39
If a minimum fee of 20 satoshi per byte is demanded, to fill 1 MB costs 0.2 BTC. Imagine we would currently have a block size limit of 4 MB, while an average block is 0.9 MB. To max out one block would cost 0,62 BTC (or $265). Or 3.72 BTC ($1600) per hour, 90 BTC ($38,000) per day. Way more than the peanuts the attackers paid the past few days.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:19:57






How does an increase of the max. block size (e.g. to 4 MB) increase the minimum requirements to use Bitcoin? As far as I know from experience, the minimum requirement is currently a smart phone with a SPV client like Mycelium. I don't see how this would be affected by a small increase of the max. block size.

Maybe a big company thinks like that, but why would a small or medium sized merchant do such a thing? Even if only one customer in a month uses bitcoin, it's still a saving (and who knows, a customer) that you would deny yourself.
I just signed up at Runbox, an email ISP. Firstly, I may not have found out about them if not someone had posted here in reddit that they started accepting bitcoin. Secondly, if I had, I would have paid by SEPA bank transfer which although free for me at my bank, I suspect a company have to pay for at the other end. Not to mention the currency exchange rate their bank would charge them (usually 1% worse than the actual rate, in my experience). So in a nutshell:
- They have a customer they otherwise might not have.
- They saved money on receiving the funds (my guess is 4% in this case).
- They got a payment confirmation in 10 minutes instead of one day.
I can't think of a reason to stop accepting, even if usage is low. Anyway, I'm motivated to pay as much with bitcoin as possible. ;)

If I send money from the Netherlands to Malaysia, I make on average 4.7% profit. That's due to the fact that bitcoin can be sold in Malaysia for a slightly higher price. But even if that would not be the case, I would still pay less than with a bank transfer in the case of small to medium sized amounts (I've never sent more than €1,000 at once).
By bank: €6 fee for my Dutch bank, €1 fee for my Malaysian bank, 1% fee on the exchange rate.
With bitcoin: no banking fees (all domestic transfers are free), Kraken fee 0.38%, Localbitcoins fee 1%.
So we have €7 + 1% vs. 1.38%. Hence, the break even point is € 1,842. 
On top of that, it takes 3 business days by bank. It takes 1 or 2 days to send money to Kraken, and usually a few hours to sell the BTC on Localbitcoins.

"the long-term value of Bitcoin may not be in the currency itself, but the technology that makes easy, low-cost transfers of money possible."  -- Uh, it's exactly the currency that *allows* easy, low-cost transfers of money possible. You only remove the exchange rate risk from customers, like BitPay does for merchants. Which I think is a very smart thing to do. As soon as more merchants give discounts to BTC-paying customers, more customers will be interested in a Circle account.
And GS is not the first bank to make a large investment in a Bitcoin company. So did BBVA (2nd bank of Spain) in Coinbase.

@_date: 2016-01-29 14:54:35
I can tell you that my perception is a different one. If I send a tx with a default fee and it takes 3 hours before it get included in a block, I perceive the blocks between the moment I issued the tx and the moment of inclusion as "full". I already experience that I'm forced to participate in a blind auction for space in the next block if I'm in a hurry to have my tx processed.
So lets agree to disagree. I consider blocks to be full once confirmation times become unpredictable due to lack of blockspace. You consider blocks to be full if tx never get confirmed.

Because it's not about fees, it's about capacity. We are soon hitting the ceiling of 250,000 tx per day, so Bitcoin cannot grow anymore. Higher fees will not give extra capacity. It will just push small tx away because Bitcoin becomes too expensive to use. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:38:00
That's why I think a minimum fee would be a good thing. At least better than a block size limit lower than the actual demand for block space.
I don't get your analogy with iPhones. I've never said that all block space should be sold. The iPhone analogy for the 1 MB cap is, let's produce 1 million iPhones, if more people want one, we'll do a blind auction and sell them to the highest bidders. And then you're surprised your app store remains rather empty (because lack of users).
@_date: 2016-03-03 06:22:27
Size of blocks is limited very close to the current required size (that's what causes this potential "sudden hash rate drop" in the first place). Having blocks at an interval twice as long also means having blocks twice as big. For which there is no headroom due to the (too) tight limit. It will mean even more tx being pushed off, and even higher tx fees.

When I wrote "blocks are currently full" there was a backlog of about 4,800 tx (about 3 blocks of 1 MB). At this moment, there are about 4,200 tx waiting to be processed (the left over tx after a full block was mined just now). During the past week, the backlog peaked at 10,000 tx on at least two occasions. That's over one hour of transactions to be processed.
I agree that there are alternating periods of full blocks and not-full blocks, during which the backlog can be cleared. During the past week, the backlog never fully cleared. (Source: tradeblock.com )

Blockspace is sold in blind auctions. It's pretty hard to predict what your bid in the auction has to be without grossly overpaying.

The first reply of James A. Donald:
*To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.*
Quite a foresight. It's still not possible for Bitcoin to have "hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions". (Currently, a quarter of a million people can do one transaction a day.)

The term "unauthorised transactions" is key. When is a transaction unauthorised? If a thief managed to break into a bank's computer system? If a thief managed to steal the access codes to a bank account? If a thief conned the account owner into sending him money?

Almost right. There are three variables here: difficulty, block reward, and fees. And the latter is the product of the average fee and the number of transactions. 
So as the block reward gets less, either the fees should rise or the difficulty should lessen. Fees can rise by increasing the average fee or by increasing the number of transactions.
For the number of transactions to rise, there has to be sufficient room in the blocks. For the average fee to rise, either miners should boycott low fee transactions or blocks should be made artificially small. For the difficulty to lessen some of the miners should stop mining.
So what benefits 3rd world bitcoin users? Low fees or high fees? Few miners or many miners? Blocks that are large enough or blocks that are too small? I think anyone can answer these questions for himself.

You were talking about European and Asian exchanges. The fact that they are on a different continent is pretty irrelevant. Of course, you should always investigate an exchange before you decide to do business with it, irrespective in which country that exchange is located. One prefers an exchange with a good reputation, in a jurisdiction with decent laws and rule of law (opposed to rule by law). In that respect, I don't see why an EU exchange would be worse than an US exchange.
Personally, I've identified myself to three exchanges: Bitstamp (Slovenia, EU), Kraken (California, US), and Clevercoin (Netherlands, EU). I think these are quite trustworthy.

If a bus service has a frequency of 6 per hour, what are the expected waiting times if a) the buses run on schedule, once every 10 minutes, and b) the buses don't stick to the schedule and drive randomly. The answers are a) 5 minutes and b) 10 minutes. You are saying it doesn't matter whether the buses drive on time. I think my statistics professor was right.

Can you elaborate on "the arguments by Peter Todd and other core devs in regards of the scaling [it] makes sense"? After all, that's the core of your post, and it's missing. 
Regarding "There is still room to grow if we can fill those empty blocks being mined and Antpool that only fills to 730kb" -- you're really asking miners to end selfish mining? That's the essence of Bitcoin.
Regarding "Just increasing the blocksize doesn't work, you need an alternative, LN is the only real realistic solution I see." I don't think many people are of the opinion Bitcoin can scale enough with only block size limit increases. But LN is far off, and we're hitting the limit more and more. A block size limit increase is just a band aid until LN (or other methods) are developed.

So Bitcoin is a democracy? No, the miners decide what coin they mine. If fees become expensive, I think that some customers will take their business elsewhere. If that leads to a large enough drop of the price of BTC, then miners may change their mind. But then it's perhaps too late.

That's why the term 'fee market' is misleading (as if it's a market for fees). It's a blind auction for block space, you're making an offer (or your wallet does so on your behalf), and you have no idea if it's going to be enough.

What you call "trying to disrupt" is actually acting on their self-interest, which every Bitcoin stakeholder would be expected to do. Exchanges, brokers, wallet companies are particularly interested in increased adoption of Bitcoin. So the policy of Core of stalling adaption by limiting the capacity of the Bitcoin network is quite threatening for the companies in question. That's why they are trying to push Bitcoin in the direction of increased capacity and larger adaption.

Yes, transactions over € 10,000 should be registered. Also, splitting a large tx up in smaller ones to avoid registration is illegal. So, taking thousands of EUR out of an ATM every week will draw attention. That's why traders ask for ID, because that keeps  criminals away who need to launder money.

Perhaps you can try to express your enthusiasm in a little more positive way. 
Okay, you say nothing is wrong with less than $5 txs, but at the same time you say they shouldn't be done as Bitcoin transactions because they create volume ("bloat"). So you think that's what's wrong. However, there's no consensus that Bitcoin should only be used for transactions larger than $5. If you feel that way, you can lobby for a minimum tx amount to be incorporated in the Bitcoin protocol.

You hit the nail on the head. It has little to do with a market, it's central planning, like the EU milk quota was. The maximum supply of milk used to be set by the EU to prevent milk prices from being too low. In a similar way Core sets a maximum block space supply to prevent tx fees from being too low. To call that a "fee market" is the same as calling the EU milk quota a "milk price market".

If you're paying other people, it matters if the tx confirms normally or with a big delay of many hours. 
I paid $0.06 on a $90 tx (45 sat/byte, 'normal' priority in mycelium), which does the job most of the time. Yes, we're talking pennies, but always paying $0.20 instead of $0.06 just in case isn't very satisfying.

I gave this comment on the article.
Nice article! I have a few comments, though.
"The currency has also had a long run of troubles with hackers and fraud, most spectacularly in 2014 when the exchange Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and bitcoins worth $460 million at the time evaporated." -- The bitcoins didn't evaporate. All bitcoins ever created are on the block chain, and always will be. Bitcoins can be stolen from their owners, or access to them can get lost. But they never, ever disappear or "evaporate". 
"The total in circulation as of January 2015 was approximately 13.7 million bitcoins, with circulation currently capped at 21 million." -- This makes it sound like the cap could be lifted any time. Maybe that's true in theory, but practically it's almost impossible. The cap is in the software, so it means the core Bitcoin developers have to propose changing or lifting the cap. Then, a majority of the Bitcoin miners/transaction processors would have to accept this change in the software. It's in nobody's interest to lift the cap, so it's very, very unlikely the developers will propose it, nor that the miners will accept it. Who in his right mind would vote in favour of watering down his bitcoin assets and income? 
"Purchased or mined bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet on the user’s computer or mobile device. If the digital keys are lost, damaged or stolen, the bitcoins are gone." -- Bitcoin (keys) can also be stored offline, on a piece of paper if needed. Also, making backups of keys is easy, and should be standard practice for any wallet that contains more than a few dollars worth of bitcoin. So losing access to your bitcoin due to loss or damage of keys is really unnecessary. Protecting bitcoin from theft is a different matter. For serious amounts of bitcoin offline storage (so called 'cold storage') is certainly recommended. Another way to protect your savings from theft is using a multi-signature wallet, requiring two (or more) signatures to authorize a transaction.

Unless you're an online shop, there's no reason not to include the sales tax into the consumer price quote. Except when you want to make it explicit that a part of the price is paid to the government. In the EU, VAT is always included in the quoted price for consumers -- but I think that's by law.

This is very much looked at from the American perspective. I live in the Netherlands, and things are somewhat different here. Firstly, I don't know of any credit cards here that give you cash back. On the contrary, it's not unusual to pay for your credit card (in my case, it's part of the service package my bank sells me). Also, paying by debit card is far more popular here. And some webshops will charge you for that -- and some of those accepting bitcoin will not charge you or less, resulting in a clear discount.
*  charges €1 when paying with debit or credit card, none with BTC.
*  charges €0.50 (+VAT) per order, and only €0.05 (+VAT) with BTC.
If I buy bitcoin, I do so at Kraken for a 0.35% fee. Sending fiat via SEPA to Kraken is free, and getting my BTC out of there is 0.5 mBTC per transfer.
However, I have to stress that most webshops don't explicitly make the debit card charges visible to the customer. Once they do, it will make a difference. After all, €1 on your €20 pizza is 5%. And €0.45 on your €10 voip phone credit is 4.5%. Way more than the 0.35% for getting bitcoins.

No, the wallet on your mobile don't contain actual coins. It contains keys which allow you to spend them. If you install the Mycelium wallet app, you should do two things before you start actually using it
* Put a PIN on accessing your wallet and spending bitcoins.
* Back it up by writing down the so-called "seed", a sequence of twelve English words, and storing it in a safe place.
If you lose your phone, the PIN will prevent someone to easily accessing your wallet. And with the seed you can recreate your wallet on another phone, and then move out the coins to a new wallet.

Bitcoin is a centrally planned economy. There is a production cap of 1 MB of transactions per block. So you can't mine the surplus of transactions and collect the fees. It's like when OPEC has decided to pump X barrels of oil, and the oil price rises due to increased demand, and they stick with the quota of X barrels. Hence, an oil shortage appears (no more block space available), with queues at the petrol stations (you have to wait hours before your transaction confirm unless you pay a premium) and the oil price explodes (tx fees go up sharply).
It won't change until the Polit Bureau (Core and big miners) change course.

They don't, because it it very unlikely to happen. It's kind of asking the question of how do shops protect them from counterfeit money. Since there's quite some counterfeit money going around, they are risk averse by refusing large denominations and test medium sized bank notes. But for small denominations they just take the risk -- and those are very seldom counterfeited, even though it's theoretically possible. 
Same with the current 0conf bitcoin tx. In theory, it can be double spend. But if you sell a beer, it's not worth the trouble avoiding the risk.

Change bank to what? All banks here in the Netherlands provide bank cards. Of course you can have a credit card on the side (which I  have, too), but that is  also no good for Circle. Debit or credit cards must be from US or UK. Even if my credit card would be accepted, it would probably mean I have to pay the same surcharge as for cash withdrawals (3%). Paying by bank or with my bank card is usually free.

I limit myself to refer to one of my postings ("Revolutions always take more time than you think"). I quote:
"A few years later the first internet service provider (aptly called xs4all, they are still in business) started in the Netherlands. Now, you could access the Internet from home! I bought a modem, and now I could do everything from home that I could do at work. Like emailing. Some people had to laugh about that. Me, writing an email while connected by phone to Amsterdam. It wasn't cheap. It was fragile (if the connection dropped, my text was lost). Skeptics said, why not send a fax? Who has an email address? Why not simply call? And of course, they were right. But the Internet could do so much more in potential! It surely would get more practical and user-friendly, I thought. And it did."
TL;DR: You are comparing apples and oranges. Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption at this point in time, just as the Internet wasn't in 1992. If you want to compare the two, make a fair comparison. What was it that transformed the user-unfriendly Internet of 1992 to what it is today? Why did the technological avant-garde see the potential of the Internet in 1992, and why do we see the potential of Bitcoin now?

@_date: 2015-03-20 11:20:37
You are conflating two events, a crashing economy and a crashing financial system. In case of the latter, you need another financial system to take over. If that system is to be Bitcoin, yes, the transaction limit needs to be raised. If that system is to be gold &amp; silver, coins have to be minted and distributed.
However, if the economy crashes it means that a lot of people lose their jobs, trade comes to a standstill. It doesn't mean fiat money will lose its value (in the 1930s it definitely didn't). If fiat money is used to "inflate" ourselves out if a depression, people may lose faith in it. But then they'll use gold and Bitcoin as a store of value, not as a payment system.
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:43:20
If Chinese miners would mostly sell their mined bitcoins outside China, it would mean that more bitcoins would be sold outside China then inside China. So the price would be driven down outside Chine compared to inside China. 
This could only be solved by arbitrage, being that people buy the cheaper bitcoins outside China with e.g. Dollars, and sell it for more in China for Yuans. But, it's difficult to get large amounts of Yuans out of China, so that isn't very likely to happen. Hence, I don't believe that most Chinese mined bitcoins are sold outside of China.

That's exactly my point, I compare the current phase of Bitcoin with the time of the Internet when there was email, but not yet the World Wide Web.

The WWW was Internet's killer app, which still has to be developed for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-08 12:31:24


It ultimately did, yes. But who would have believed you saying that in 1992?


Oh yes they do. It's very simple. PayPal requires a credit or debit card to be linked. Bitcoin doesn't, it's just like cash in how you use it. 


The same way you would explain in 1992 why the Internet would need more time to develop, while letters and faxes were doing a better job.


No. You have to be able to adapt to your audience.


Minus 5%, that is. And will you have that dollar immediately?


Depends who I'm talking to.


The middleman story is important, because that's where the fees go. And that's where the control resides (see Mega and Wikileaks).


You're not taking away my dream, because it's not a dream. It's an expectation. I would be surprised if we didn't develop a killer application for trustless value transfer in the years to come. Maybe bitcoin will not become mainstream money (perhaps it will indeed stay always on the fringe), but there are plenty of other potential applications. Let's see in 5 years from now. ;)

It's not a problem, it's a fact of life. Like the Internet, Bitcoin needs to be made easy, and it needs a killer app. Given its potential of trustless value transfer, this will happen (just like it did with the Internet). I just takes time, it took the Internet 10-15 years.
@_date: 2016-05-26 21:54:38
Paxful charges 1%, and that's a decent fee. I think you're confused with what the advertisers charge on top of this 1%.  This depends very much on the fiat payment methods and the risks involved. E.g. SEPA bank transfers are only 3%  (which includes Paxful's 1%). It's not much different on LocalBitcoins.

Two major mistakes in this article:
1) "Some mainlanders are surely buying bitcoin to engage in relatively innocent forms of financial speculation. But they are probably outnumbered by the people who are using it to move yuan overseas, while circumventing Beijing’s currency controls." -- Using bitcoin to move money out of China doesn't only mean Yuans are sold for bitcoin in China, but also that bitcoins are sold outside China for dollars, euros, yen, Swiss francs, etc. If this is indeed happening, then (a) trade outside China vs. inside China would be much more than the current 20%/80%. And (b) there would be a price differential. Bitcoins inside China would be more expensive, and outside China would be cheaper. Neither two effects can be seen. Hence, we can conclude that bitcoin is hardly used for moving capital out of China.
2) "With the market thought to be capped at about 21 million bitcoins, it’s unlikely the currency will pose an overwhelming challenge to the People’s Bank of China." -- How does the total supply of bitcoin relate to size of the challenge for the PBOC? Did the Zimbabwean dollar become a bigger challenge for the PBOC because Robert Mugabe printed so many of them? The author could perhaps have said instead "With a current market cap of $4bn, it's unlikely...". But even that is disputable.

I sell regularly at LB, and I think you're more safe as a buyer than as a seller. For the buyer, the BTC are in escrow. If the seller won't release the coins, you can start a dispute. I reckon if you can prove you sent the money, you'll always win the dispute. However, for the seller there's the possibility that the buyer tries to roll back the fiat transfer. That's why I don't accept PayPal payments, only bank transfers. Those are more difficult to roll back.

There's only one reason to meet in person, which is to stay completely anonymous.

The answer to your question is much simpler. The labels "Buying" and "Selling" don't refer you, but to the buyers and sellers. So if *you* want to buy, you need to look in the "Selling" list to see who's selling. And that list has (conveniently) the lowest price on top.

Firstly, this is an EU law. As such, it has little to do with the Euro. It will apply to non-Euro using member states (like the UK, Sweden, Poland, etc) as well.
Secondly, if credit card companies (and banks, in the case of debit cards) can't render the service below the cap, they will be forced to get their revenue in a different way. Like billing the user of the card directly, e.g. by raising the annual or quarterly fee. This is a good thing, because it will make it more transparent what these payment systems actually cost. Good news for Bitcoin, IMHO.
The expectation that governments have to come to the rescue to credit card companies with state subsidies is silly. Did this happen with telcos after their roaming charges cash cow got capped? No, their fee structure became more fair.
Let me end by emphasizing again this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Euro.

Apples and oranges. There's Gresham's Law, that describes how bad money drives out good money, which is about money with similar face value. It doesn't apply to two monies with different face values. It's explained in detail here, 
What you (very well) describe is how monies with *different* face value and *different* rates of inflation compete. You call the low inflation money "good", and the high inflation money "bad". The latter is treated like a hot potato, and nobody wants to keep it. 
The difference between the "oranges" phenomenon and the "apples" phenomenon is the interpretation of money A driving out money B. In Gresham's Law, being driven out of circulation means to be hoarded. In the other case it means being driven out to be decommissioned (in the end it will return to its intrinsic value -- used paper).

Not negligible at all. If banks maintain a reserve of 10%, they increase the money supply by a factor 10. In the case of 5%, it is a factor 20. In Europe, most banks had a reserve of ~3%, which means 33x increase in money. And that's why QE doesn't lead to inflation. Because the banks are desperately trying to increase their reserves. If the banks in Europe go from 3% to 4% reserves, the money supply shrinks by 25%. You need to print a lot a money to fill up that hole!

Nope. The simplest explanation for the variation of the balance of a bank account is that it is used as a bank account (i.e. money gets debited and credited). The less simple explanation is that funds have been stolen from it. The issue of 15 transactions vs. 1 is a separate one. Yes, one transaction is simpler than 15, but should not be linked to the transactions being ordinary or exceptional.

What is the cause and what is the effect? In my view, overleveraging (European banks only had 3% reserves) creates a lot of credit and hence, low rates. Central banks set the base rate to target a low inflation rate (2% in the Eurozone). Yes, the target is 2% instead of 0% to make government debt melt away. But if inflation goes up (e.g. because of government over-spending), the base rate is adjusted upwards.

So people don't spend bitcoin because they are deflationary (i.e. gain in value), and they don't spend them because they lose their value. Now what is it, please make up your mind.


If bitcoin is really so precious that they're not spent, why would retailers stop accepting them? Every sathoshi would be one gained. And why would they exchange the few they receive immediately for fiat currency? Doesn't make sense at all. I conclude that retailers (with the possible exception of Overstock) don't value bitcoin at all, and are only interested in the extra customers they might attract by accepting bitcoin. Given the small size of the latter group this is bound to be a disappointment.

It is totally unpredictable what the price will be in the next two years. I expect it to be North of the $200 region we're now, but it could be anything. Regarding Bitcoin knowledge dissemination, a lot of seeds are sown at the moment. Respectable mainstream media like the Wall Street Journal paint a positive picture of Bitcoin's potential. This inevitably leads to a greater awareness, and hence, new people having this eureka moment all of us here experienced. Once the first couple of startups based on Bitcoin technology breaks though and gets media attention, flocks of new people will join the Bitcoin revolution. It's only the timing that's unpredictable.

Ever since I've  been involved with Bitcoin (since October 2013), the node count has been steadily declining, while blocks have grown from 125 kB back then to 1 MB now. 2.5 years ago there were about 9,000 nodes, opposed to almost 6,000 now.
But correlation doesn't imply causality. You really think 40% of the people stopped running a node because now there's 8x more data to handle? Of course not, it's obviously due to the increased popularity of SPV wallets. 4 years ago, if you wanted to set up your own Bitcoin wallet, you had to run a node. Hardly anyone does that anymore. Running nodes is only done by those who find it technically interesting, and those who really care about verifying tx. Companies that handle Bitcoin a lot would be interested in the latter. Of those, not many exist, yet. But that will change with increased usage of Bitcoin.
Here's the catch. By throttling the usage of Bitcoin, those node-running companies may never appear in big numbers. You can't remove SPV wallets from the equation anymore, they are a given. So halting Bitcoin growth isn't going to stop nodes being replaced by SPV wallets.

"The only investment that really keeps its value in the long run is gold, and in the future perhaps bitcoin. Production of gold and bitcoin is limited. Not so with money. The central banks can print money unlimited. And they are perfectly clear about this. Hence, it's not a stable store of value."

And the same is true for not increasing the demand for running a full node (by limiting the use of Bitcoin).
So it boils down to assessing what hurts Bitcoin more, bigger blocks (and more growth, leading to less nodes in the short run but more nodes in the long run), or stalled growth (and slightly fewer nodes in the short run and less nodes in the long run).
One thing is for sure, the tx capacity is maxxed out for now, until SegWit becomes operational, which may take another year. Also sure is that even for LN, 1 MB blocks are too small. So no matter which strategy is the lesser evil, we know that bigger blocks are inevitable.

My comment posted at the article:
Cherry picking. Bitcoin has been over $1000 (on Bitstamp) during one week of its existence of 6 years. That's 3% of its lifetime. Yet, somehow this number seems to have become the benchmark for bitcoin. (It has been above $250 for over a year of its 6 years existence.)
Furthermore, thieves will always attempt to steal money, in that regard bitcoin is no different from dollars, euros or yuan (the recent story of the fake Chinese bank springs to mind). Dollars are the currency of choice of criminals, nothing new about that, and in certain (but only in certain) situations bitcoin is better suited.
And finally, big progress is being made to make holding bitcoin more secure, be it with hardware wallets (like Trezor) or insured online wallets (like Circle). The latest bitcoin exchange that opened last week even has FDIC insured dollar accounts.
The Bitcoin ecosystem learns from every mistake, and people are eager to counter problems that emerge. That's the way it has been the past six years, and there's no reason this is about to change. Meanwhile, one after the other Bitcoin application emerges, from nifty ones for crowd funding (Lighthouse,  ) to simple ones like an internet payphone (  ) -- and everything in between. Bitcoin is thriving!

The phone number is checked after you enter it, and it will tell you which operator it belongs to. I assume if it's an operator they don't service, you will not get a QR code to send BTC to. (In my case, I was offered the correct amounts to chose from for topping up.)

It went from RM 3.20 : $1 in August 2014 to RM 4.05 now, so it lost 20% of it's value in two years, just like the British Pound (from 0.60 : $1 to 0.75) . Hardly a free fall.
The past 10 months the Ringgit went 10% up. The Pound went 15% down.

...and that's why it's so important that transaction revenue grows as the block reward diminishes. That's why capping the number of transactions below the demand in the market is a bad move.

The current version of Bitcoin is running at max capacity (roughly 250,000 transactions per day). Hence, without capacity increase, it cannot grow any further. This could happen by allowing bigger blocks (they are currently limited to a max. size of 1 MB), layers on top (like the Lightning Network), or side chains. Otherwise, users are soon forced to switch to other cryptocurrencies.

"at the moment" is not the same as on July 10. Since April, the monthly median block size is 1 MB.
Of course, the current miners can be substituted by new miners. Which is true for all actors of Bitcoin. Recently, it was attempted to substitute the current developers. It proved more difficult than some people expected. So good luck with that.

However, a very sensible comment like this is downvoted to oblivion here. So let me repost it.
quoting &gt; One of the huge problems with the article is that it assumes we're "at a point on the curve" where increasing the block size limit would decrease "decentralization" which isn't necessarily the case. Assume for example that the current block size limit were 0.5 kb, thus allowing for exactly one average-sized transaction per block. I think pretty clearly increasing the block size limit from there to say 50 kb (thereby allowing a 100-fold increase in throughout) would represent a net increase in the "decentralization" of the Bitcoin network by any reasonable metric. And even if we are at a point where further increases in the limit would result in a decrease in "decentralization," it still becomes a question of whether or not the trade-off is worth it (e.g., if we could increase on-chain throughout 1,000-fold at the cost of a 0.0001 percent reduction in "decentralization," that would presumably be a no-brainer). Related thoughts here. Another major problem I see with the article is the way it ignores the tradeoffs / added risks that are inherent in any layer two solution. They're not some panacea that magically allows us to keep the block size limit arbitrarily small.

0.374396 BTC today (Sunday) x $261.42 (highest rate on Bitstamp today until 2 hrs ago) = $97.87 = £65.56. So how on Earth did you end up paying £142.94 for that?
I guess that "checking bitbargain and localbitcoins for the best price" didn't really result in the best price by far if that price is more than double the market price. If BTC is really that scarce in the UK, it's time to start a trade.
Perhaps you can try  next time. Even now with the BTC gone up a bit, 0.374396 BTC is still only £70.

Even if miners don't control the consensus rules, they decide for themselves if they upgrade to SW or not, so they are needed for that.

Centralisation pressure should be traded off with growth and adoption. What happens now is that growth is frozen at an arbitrary level (of about 250,000 tx per day) without any quantitative rationale why.

So what? For sure some empty blocks can be identified as well. That's why I was talking about monthly median block sizes.


Perhaps I don't understand how Bitcoin works, but I think that miners need to upgrade their software for SW to become available.  Otherwise, why would the Hong Kong agreement state "We [the miners] will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core"?

Soon^TM, I don't expect any significant tx capacity to become available before the end of this year. There's also the issue of the miners who feel the HK-agreement is not being honoured.

Transaction volume is maxxed out at a quarter of a million transactions a day. If you make an assumption how many transactions an average user makes, you have an estimate on the number of users. E.g. assume the average user makes one tx per week, then you get at almost 2 million users.
I'm doing about 20 tx per week, but I think I'm not an average user. (If I would be, then there would only be about 90,000 users.)

There is always a certain amount of centralisation. It should be traded off with growth and adoption. This trade off isn't made, instead an arbitrary limit is taken.
It's nice that new technology is in the works, but it will take quite some time before Bitcoin can continue to grow with the help of this new technology.

Total fees are the product of price per tx and number of tx. By limiting the latter, the total amount of fees is constrained.
My use of the word artificial should be interpreted in the context of the current distortion of the free market of supply and demand for transactions, in which is intervened by choking the capacity of the network, resulting in additional fees.
