That is 87% of the people who voted. The majority of people didn't know or cared enough to vote. It was mainly used as a poll, where a significant sample of the stakeholders would represent the whole population.
Other polls were held aswell. By miningpools, exchanges and developers. The vast majority was and still is in favor of the hardfork.
But interestingly enough, money talks.. and new buyers can still play a role. So if you want to explore outside of Bitcoin, why not try some Ethereum? :)

Not even those are immutable. With enough mining power, those transactions can be rolled back.
Point I'm trying to make is that in order to be useful, a blockchain doesn't need perfect immutability. It just needs to be more reliable and transparent then it is now.

It wasn't very clear to a lot of people that it was going on. I kinda knew but didn't think it was anything to take seriously. Only after that blog post on the ethereum.org website, it was mentioned that it would be taken as default.
Having said that, I still think it was a rather accurate representation of reality, since many other types of stakeholders held their own polls as I said before.
I don't like to make any predictions and try to be as neutral as possible, but currently, even though it seems to be a binary option, the ETC chain really is the underdog with very little support. However, that support has been growing lately... although not sure if that will keep going. When developing I currently only look at ETH as  the main chain, but I'm good either way.
The whole reason why the community forked was because they feared that a chain where a single 'bad' actor would hold so much ether was too big a risk for the future of Ethereum. If it turns out that ETC will grow beyong ETH, those fears will be proven to be unfounded and I'd be happy to switch.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:22:47
I don't know exactly who or how many stakeholders voted, but from all the transactions combined the amount of ether was counted.
    Yes vote        3,964,516  4.8%
    No  vote          577,899  0.7%
    
    Total supply   82,392,562  100%

It's not a problem, it's a fundamental tradeoff. More decentralization means more communication overhead. Current networking and computing make decentralized networks possible on a global scale, but only up to a point. Even if technology gets better, local consensus will still be faster. But it's like nation states, you can have a few large organisations exchange value and within those global organizations there can be local consensus, secured by the larger global consensus.

Is there research on the perceived customer experience, knowing which number you are in the queue and being able to see hourly progress on this? Perhaps with an estimate on how long it will take based on that speed. Of course there are high priority cases, so you should be able to select that option if you meet certain requirements (amount, customer record, urgency exceptions) and if you lie about your situation, the ticket would be put at the back of the queue.

A ledger is supposed to be mutable, otherwise you can't update it. The point is that the history of the ledger should be immutable.
I would agree with the part that pre allocation was done, however it was a voluntary choice of all the miners to use that initial distribution in the genesis. If the majority had not agreed to it, they wouldn't have mined on top of it. Similarly, the miners currently respect the Bitcoin history even though only a very small group started mining after genesis.

It's much simpler than that. Let's say, you create a private key. It's *impossible* to prove that I **don't** know the same private key and thus also own the bitcoins. It's about chance and not about registration.

There is no major fundamental difference between BTC and ETH as an asset class compared to traditional assets. The biggest differences are:
- state transition function (UTXO Script vs EVM account) 
- notary authority (SHA-256 vs Ethash)
- security assumption (SHA-256 vs Keccak256)
- monetary policy (deflationary vs disinflationary) 
- network bootstrap (highest blocknumber vs total difficulty) 
Those are minor compared to actual commodities, fiat money or securities vs BTC. Both can be considered a platform and both can be considered currency or utility token.

It doesn't work like that, if they mine publicly, other pools can continue mining of their blocks and go have a success rate of 49% (proportional to their hashing power) but if Ghash mines in secret, they can disrupt the chain by creating an alternative fork which will become longer than the rest, which can't be reversed because all clients by default continue on the longest chain. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:19:40

If you are looking for escrow services, Bitcoin is still safer.
You can make a transaction agreement with a merchant which needs a 2nd signature to confirm. This way you can add a mediator, which only gets the power to confirm or reverse the transaction. They can't confistate the money nor can they block your transaction. They would only request your personal details in case of a conflict, to verify your claim.
This is anti-fraud prevention and still safer than PayPal and CreditCard transactions.

Can somebody explain to me how the activities of Charlie Shrem and BTC King were money laundering?
As far as I know, money laundering is about taking money which were the monetary proceedings of criminal activity and converting it into a different form of value.
What they did was provide bitcoins to users who were then themselves responsible for anything they do with that. Much like the way any ATM at a bank works or somebody paying out salaries to people who then use it for criminal activities.
How could Charlie be responsible for anything that somebody does with goods that he didn't even supply directly?
The only mistake I can see in the indictment is his suspicion of one of his users that had a higher daily order than he was allowed to and failiing to report it. But unless you can prove that those cash deposits came from criminal activity, I don't see much more of a case here.
What am I missing?

There are no laws giving you exclusive rights to the intellectual property of that private key. This means any address you specify as the output for a Bitcoin transaction which you receive in an exchange with somebody else, is currently unprotected and has no legal ownership. You currently have to trust math to protect you. Until there is precedent that a court somewhere will grant you ownership and punish the person who didn't have the rights to make a transaction out of that address.

Like she said... she thinks it's about the brand image which decides the value of a coin and to a point she is correct. First think people look at are the name and the logo. Only if a currency survives longer then people start looking at the specific properties to explain the cause.

That can be done by signing a message with the private key.
Not incredibly user friendly right now, but it is possible and not extremely hard either. But you probably already knew that... keep up the good work.

Plus, if the entry and exit points they control, the more they can datamine interesting insight in financial patterns between their customers. Bitcoin users have no privacy rights like banks. It's harder to trace technically, but easier to retrieve transactions to analyse when it comes to law. (Even if that is not their current policy. As long as the customer data exists and the blockchain exists, they can always change it in the future)
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:06:31
What does *".... involved in Bitcoin"* mean?
Do you specifically market with the word *Bitcoin* or has any money been tranferred to any Bitcoin-company? Or does the company actually have bitcoins on the books?
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:15:13
This isn't about friendliness, but both bank- and consumer protection.
Too often people claim: "I didn't buy this" and try to get their money back. So they now want to check that people actually did this voluntarily (and register them as such - I wonder what a flag like *'is stupid enough to put money in bitcoins'* does to your credit rating.)

He technically never accepted anything though. Only until he creates a transaction to move the coins does he actively participate in the network.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:56:23
And these sidechains could have different rules. So for example transactions could have different denominations (more units), more information allowed per transaction, faster block processing, more scripting freedom, etc.
If for some reason a sidechain gets 50% attacked, all the bitcoins could get stolen on lost though.

I agree. I still see stories of people getting scammed for sending bitcoins online. It would be nice if creating an escrow transaction was just as easy and available by default in Bitcoin wallets as the creation of ordinary transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:27:22
Because a private key is pure information and there is no way to prove the single (or duplicate) existence of a private key, how what constitutes a bitcoin to be your property before it is used in a transaction? Unless you can prove that you always knew the private key from the start and didn't share it with somebody else, there is no way to prove ownership.
I think this story isn't over yet and when enough money is at stake and innovative constructions occur, these questions will rise in court.

I guess that's my point. Don't expect that using the word 'theft' is going to help you getting protection from the law. Effectively once somebody gains access to the private key, they own it just as much as you do. The first to use it, would be the beneficiary according to the law (and the one who needs to pay capital gains or income taxes on their value)

Bitcoin is a draconian tool in the wrong hands. All the money can be traced back to an initial transaction and will be available for study with pattern recognition and other statistical analysis as long as it moves through the blockchain.
I almost wish that regulations would make it so impractical to use, that we are forced to upgrade the technology to eliminate the full transaction history and make it impossible to see where the money came from even if you wanted to. (Zerocash or consensus on the Bitcoin network that stealth addresses and a minimum level of mixing are required)
If we wait until everybody uses Bitcoin before it is turned into a tool of submission, then people will have a more difficult time to switch.
If Napster wasn't shut down, then BitTorrent wouldn't have been this popular and it would have been much easier to control .

The software is free, open source and everybody is allowed to compile from source themselves (so there will be forks which you can download)
They don't charge you for the software, but just the trust they created. If you decide that you don't want to pay for that, then feel free use another wallet or another version of their software.
It's the most society friendly business model out there.

Using LN or still using the limited resource mechanism where users have to pay a higher price to get their transaction confirmed by a miner when it's busy on the network? I would not like to see people complaining again about the bitcoin being useless when it gets more popular.

Don't be surprised when that happens. The same ridiculous allegations can be made there. BitPay accepts ALL bitcoins, so basically they are knowingly laundering money too.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:00:56
Even worse, they can be held liable over facilitating money laundering. They almost have the power to always create the longest chain, so they can effectively filter out all 'illegal' transactions. If history is any indication, government will step in and force them to have KYC rules for every address from which is spent.
This sound ridiculous and impractical for something like Bitcoin, but that's basically how it goes with all payment providers. This is how PayPal ended up where it is today.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:10:52
It's going to be a trade off between risk and the potential for not only the extra fees, but also for making Bitcoin more useful. However since the network rarely even comes close to 7TPS, I don't see why they would.

You can sell them to people who can use them because they are more convenient and cheaper to use than their current options.

In 2011 it went from a $29 high all the way down to a $2 low over the course of 6 months and it took over a year to get back to $10. That would be now from $1200 to $80 in the summer and $400 at the end of 2015.
I think Bitcoin is here to stay, but trying to predict anything JUST based on a chart is a very limited view. You need to know the context.
If enough people are burnt by this incident and prices aren't rising ... the speculators quit. And if this rise &amp; crash keeps happening, normal people don't want to hold either. It's going to take a long and stable history before people trust holding bitcoins again.

He has more than once acknowledged the current limitations of Bitcoin and the possibilities it could be exceeded by another technology. He is just genuinely at a point where he isn't worried anymore because he has seen the community come together to fix the protocol multiple times now. 
Similar to how society isn't that worried anymore that vital industries like power stations, banks and the government are hooked up to the Internet. Sure there is a lot of hacking, but society hasn't fallen apart because of it (yet) and workarounds are found. 
At one point it's just not rational anymore to keep worrying. Sure you might take the risk of losing your money into account,. Just make sure you aren't 100% exposed to any single system when it breaks down.

It's not so simple. And being the only units on the Bitcoin transactional network bitcoins are by definition a (virtual) currency. And it IS a real currency for people who treat it that way. So during the transaction it is a currency, outside of the transaction it's all up to you.
As far as a solution to your problem, I see only 3 solutions
* You take the volatility risk (and use escrow transactions)
* Customer takes the volatility risk (Bitcoin users are used to it) 
* Find a company willing to insure your transactions

BitInstant was in the business of selling bitcoins. BitPay is in the business of accepting bitcoins and selling them on exchanges. They probably do the selling part through a registered exchange, but for accepting bitcoins they have no rules for where they gave been. They basically provide an ability for criminals to spend their bitcoins.  I think it is ridiculous to expect them to keep track of everybody spending their bitcoins, but especially in light of this recent arrest I wouldn't be surprised that somebody at BitPay will suffer the same fate. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 09:58:29
They don't see the added value for a relatively low userbase and the practical limitation to have recurring payments. Theoretically it's possible in Bitcoin and there are proof of concepts, but there are few if any reliable services offering this feature. I asked them about it and they said: "The cost/benefit seems to high". When I pointed them to the fact that their payment processor Stripe already [in the process of integrating]( it for them, they didn't realize. But there hasn't been any announcement yet and I doubt they will make it a pleasant experience.
Many businesses these days depend on the absuse of people's inability to recognize the full cost of a subscription. Monthly prices are displayed and people seeing these lower prices don't do the total amount calculation and then many forget cancelling a subscription after it's already too late. The exploitation of that part of human behaviour has unfortunately become a large part of our economy. 
With Bitcoin you need to pay up front and as a company you get less control over pulling money out of somebodies bank-account.
Once larger wallet providers start supporting pull-mechanisms, I doubt those businesses will be interested. But that has nothing to do with Bitcoin anymore, which is about empowering people over their money.

I really hope Bitcoin will become a major player in the world financial market, but I don't really like the idea that people will start flocking to Bitcoin out of fear of missing the boat.
In the years before 2013, I was really hoping and waiting for mass adoption or at least some kind of validation that we were on the right track. Last year we finally got that. But after this Bitcoin-hysteria of 2013, I get the impression that the Bitcoin industry could use a media break.... let it run almost under the radar again for a year or two like 2011Q3-2013Q1 before people realize that the infrastructure has matured a lot since and is actually ready for a new influx of users.

Make sure you realise that you are not making an account with a company. All you need to use Bitcoin is two unique numbers. Both are created on your phone and not registered anywhere. The first number you shared with us (which is ok) and the other part which you need to keep secret. They are linked with math, but only the secret number can be used to create transactions. Make sure you realise that the secret part is ONLY on your phone now. If you lose your phone, you lose access to the money.
If you don't have your phone with you, you can also look at your balance here:  That website is not an 'official' Bitcoin website (there is no such thing...) but because the ledger is public, everybody can see and display the balance on a website.

Any existing network effect is hard to overcome, but not to try is not an option.
As for losing the keys, you can still outsource that to a cloudservice.


Can be solved by setting a storage limit per installation. Like BitTorrent, you don't always have to upload the same amount as you download. Again, you can have cloud services where you keep your accounts. It's less decentralized, but still better than a single centralized Twitter that keeps everything.

Control isn't necessarily the same as ownership. You could prove knowledge of the private key, but would that prove ownership? Wouldn't it matter how you acquired that key and who made the original transaction to put bitcoins in that account?

This seems like a great idea. That way people can download Bitcoin Core and use it right away,  but in the background it will download the blockchain and once it's complete, it can act like a full node. That way we can advise more people to use it. Although the open port is also a requirement.

I don't think a 5-year-old would understand that explanation.
Here what I would say:
MtGox looked at a unique number in a transaction to identify it. But they made a mistake because this number was not really unique. Some bad guys could change that number and trick MtGox into saying the transaction didn't happen so they could get their money back. MtGox should have looked at other parts of the transaction and are now trying to fix it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:23:42
Same goes for frauding Mt.Gox into sending bitcoins twice.

Bitcoin is a transactional netwerk and they ONLY things allowed on that netwerk are transactions representing 'bitcoins'... So within that network, the *only thing* you can pay with is bitcoins. That makes them *'generally accepted or in use'*. Valid transactions containing bitcoins are the currency of that network. And they have no value at all besides transacting. The only reason why they are valuable to people is as a system of money... there is no commodity value behind it. I'm sure large holders would like a favourable tax-rate. I am not a laywer, but I think that would be cheating.

After all the media attention, so many people still don't understand it? Bitcoin is a symbol for economic freedom. 
A currency fully based on the community and the network effect around it. If the trust by the community fails (and it could do so rather quickly) or a better currency comes along, the entire price of the currency will collapse. So yes, in that respect... people will lose a lot of money. But that's because it's so free. This is a currency for people who know what they are doing and are willing to take the risk. Nothing wrong with that, but there is no guarantee that the price will increase forever like some people seem to think.

I don't think the Dutch consumers are the first to benefit from Bitcoin and I find it strange that [market research shows]( 1% of their population owning bitcoins, because it doesn't make their life much easier.

I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of his description of the system, until he got around to the mining.
He misses the point there. The analogy with mining is certainly valid, because bitcoins are basically rare... and they are produced by the miner himself. However, they can only be produced along with a valid block - so the  difference with mining is that the miner here is allowed to keep these newly created bitcoins, if he created them honestly.
The transaction fees however are different. That part is basically a reward bounty which can be counted as income for finding the valid block first.
Besides. With gold mining you don't *produce* gold... you just *uncover* gold. You could go into philosophical discussions whether you do the same with Bitcoin because the software already describes how many bitcoins there can be for the next block.

PayPal requires both the consumer and the merchant to use the same provider, creating vendor lock in. Bitcoins makes it possible for the consumer and merchants to use different services or even directly store the bitcoins themselves which alleviates the need for a third party altogether.

As long as the trick isn't that you won't be holding it the keys to your own wallet. However, my gut tells me that they will. So this basically you won't be holding bitcoins at all, THEY will and is another one of those companies that can prevent you from spending your money or confiscate it if they want. They may want to hold the keys for you. Sound like another MtGox - a bitcoin exchange - but this time with an automatic hedging contract.

Bitcoin can be used safely, but it really depends on the way you use it and your level of computer expertise.
As for price volatility, as long as you don't hold very long... you should be ok, but don't hold amounts in BTC that you can't do without.
Best is to just experiment with very small amount and see how it works so you can decide for yourself if you feel comfortable using it.

The reporter asks a very valid question. If it's not a currency, then what is it? There is not much else you can do with it besides being a unit of account and store of value. There is a fundamendal disconnect between what the law considers a currency and what the dictionary considers a currency.

By extending your usage to an external website, they have more control over your information as a user... whereas using it within the confinement of Reddit, all they can know is what is publically accessable or request information through a private message, which limits any possible (right to) automatic information gathering.

They went out of their way to clarify that they are selling ether as a software product which can be used for developing and using the network to be created by them (which may not even become the most popular version) and with no expectation for an increase in value. 
Anything around that is probably misinterpretation of the technology hype around it (granted, created by themselves) 
People not directly related to their organisation who then evangelise the ether itself as a financial investment. You can't fault the creators for that. That's like blaming the company behind Beany babies as if they were marketing and selling their toys as securities. Even though they benefitted from people who regarded them as such.

I _am_ debating the OP, because his motivation is trying to mislead people into thinking they get more units and hopefully they are more inclined to buy.


I'm saying that people also care more about getting the initial unit (1 btc) in the first place. They feel happier with 500 bits than with 0.5BTC - even though it has the same value. Those two effects weighted together could end up with the opposite effect of what OP wants.
Regardless, I still agree with moving to a smaller denomination which avoids the need for me to use fractions which leads to a better user experience.

Please don't forget to mention that Bitcoin is still an experiment and risky. Make it clear that even though many of these companies have now added their support, this doesn't mean there is any guarantee that the volatility will decrease. The paradox is that if the price proves to be stable, more people want to buy it and another bubble is likely to happen within the next year, making it less stable.

This is not the lesson I take from this. You can see that other exchanges are advertising their provable solvency or scrambling to do so. This means in a market where companies can go under for bad practices, competition will upgrade their service to avoid losing people's trust or same happening to them. 
The Mt.Gox story is a lesson on how to improve the quality of your service. Has been for the past 2,5 years. First the hack, then the dossing, the terrible support and now the insolvency. 
Now there are still exchanges out there with similar shady backgrounds. It's up to you to shop for a good one (or multiple to distribute the risk)

They biggest problem many people seem to have is the mining-aspect of Bitcoin. It's the one thing that glues the whole system together. Only because mining is trusted, do people trust the network. And mining is only trusted because it's decentralized. And if there are mining cartels, you can compete non-violently with faster computing power from the other side of the world (fueling innovation on that area for faster chipdesign which could then be used for the development of more general purpose chips) - opposed to proof-of-stake which is just another way to have shareholders.
Those who think that the blockchain can be harnassed just don't get it. It's not more efficient than a centralized system at all. Banks and other payment providers could restructure their IT services and processes and become much faster to compete.. but that's not the point. The true effectiveness is in the decentralized part. It's a way to protect and distribute value without a central party controlling it.

I do see the harm, however Bitcoin doesn't make a single guarantee that you are the exclusive owner of that address. Even governments have stated that there is no protection. That effectively makes it the mistake and problem of the Bitcoin user who thought they had any kind of rights of ownership instead of just mathematical protection.
I really want people to understand that. Until there is no (worldwide) legal protection against people guessing and using any private key, it is effectively not illegal to guess and use a brainwallet key for yourself.

It doesn't really work like that.
When you can't see where the money is coming from, you can't prove that somebody was the owner of the funds in the first place. Remember that guy who put up that sign and his QR code on TV? How do you know he didn't send most of those bitcoins to himself?
I think you'll better understand how to look at it if you realise 'bitcoins' themselves don't exist. They're virtual .. a result of things that DO exist: The transactions.
So basically, creating a transaction is creating value, based on information you have - much like websites you create based on a unique combination of html/js/css knowledge and sell on the market, where the buyer expects it to remain valuable for him.
The transactions (validated and collected into a valid block on the blockchain by others) are what you eventually use to trade. The private keys themselves, which are just numbers in a predictable set which aren't proprietary to anybody, are worthless without those transactions. And the transactions don't exist until they are made by a person.

**Sidechains** are like altcoins, but where the token-issuance depends on a cryptographic link between the original Bitcoin blockchain. That means you can create a token on the alternative network if you prove that you spent a coin in the Bitcoin network in a way that you have no more control over it. In some technical scenario's you could do the same thing in both directions.
**Open Transactions** is a vision based around a cryptographic library which runs on servers and clients, but where the servers don't need ledgers, money can be issued (with bitcoin collateral) and transactions are instantly processed based on 'smart contracts' (scales up much easierthan bitcoin). The servers can hold the funds together in something called a '[voting pool]( where a group of servers join together with a multisig wallet, where one single server can't run off with the money.

Actually the blockchain and bitcoin scripting language provides the ability for those exchanges to create security and audit measures which are not possible by traditional trading companies. The power of Bitcoin can make them even more reliable that way.
You can:

Paying at the taco place was also done clunky... everything could have been in mBTC (no leading zeros) and the price can be read off the QR-code so you don't have to enter it manually. They insisted on getting $660 worth of bitcoins with no plan on where to spend it and then complain about the exchange fees. They could have also spend some bitcoin on something online, but insisted on making face-to-face transactions.

Most transactions already require transaction fees. The miners can decide which transactions they include in blocks. They get the transaction fees, so many of them don't process transactions without a fee. Fee-prices are a free market among miners. The number of transactions per block needs to increase by a factor of hundreds or thousands to make it profitable for miners.

In fact that's possible. Just almost nobody would accept them. There is no legal definition for what is a good bitcoin and what is a bad bitcoin. We just take a mathematical degree of certainty before we accept them. In fact, it happens quite often that bitcoins are created, but not accepted by the rest of the network (forks). I think it's cheating if you would say "well they were never bitcoins to begin with".

Actually all money is either physical and/or a contract with another person. Intellectual property is the exception, but there special laws for that to define ownership. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:32:45
It may get tricky when some large companies or rich people start getting into trouble because of the double standard and decide to fight in court over which rules apply to their business. If it's property, you need protection from theft, but you need rules on when they are yours (currently unclear because you can't prove that private keys aren't duplicated and private keys aren't registered to names)
It could end up in a situation where you need to register your private keys before you can get any theft protection. So who ever registers first, will be the legitimate owner of any coins. Problem is that private keys are not meant to be reused for security reasons. So maybe only bip32 keys or stealth addresses can be registered.
This may result in preventive registration or people trying to register as many keys as possible. And this doesn't address international rights to those bitcoins, because in some countries it has been classified as private money or is propose to be treated as foreign currency.

Yes I think Overstock just really has smart people working there and created a customer service flow where they own up to their own mistakes.

Distribution is currently not equally distributed, but this system is much more fair. Unlike traditional systems (or proof-of-stake coins for that matter) the powerful and wealthy can't influence Bitcoin to their benefit. They need to keep making smart business decisions or their holdings will decline as they spend it. Governments are already going after people like Charlie Shrem and Ross Ulbricht... other early adopters are sure to follow. They won't stay rich forever.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:39:15
Instead of trusting a single government or bank with your money,  you now shift the trust in the reliability of the network and distribution of new coins to a whole community effort of multiple companies and volunteers. You shift the responsibility of holding your money to yourself like with cash, unless you trust another company like Coinbase to hold it for you.

That is a rather shortsighted answer. My guess he is talking about the current Bitcoin blockchain ledger and the trust that people have in their value of its tokens.

Same with bitcoins. People use them because the are worth something to them. It saves them money.... Less cost in storing gold, less fees and faster. That is why there is demand. 
Bitcoins are worth something because they are useful. When they stop being useful... only then will the price be pennies. However you and I both know there are currently plenty of people who together would buy all 12 million for more than $10 a piece.

The problem with that is that a bitcoin address is not registered to a person. They have no proof that the coins are yours. Unlike physical goods which are on your property or money in a registered bank account. Only if you create a transaction of certain value in exchange for profit, will they be able to confiscate the profit from you. Until then, bitcoins and private keys are just information without a real owner.
This is one of the reasons why I think governments around the world will scramble and try to force people to register Bitcoin-accounts and render any other type of address illegal. Eventhough that would be horrible for privacy and perhaps even security.

I think you can look at it differently. There is now a group building the Ethereum platform as they envision it. Everybody acknowledges that it is an experiment which at some point will need to go live. But even when it goes live, the real experiment begins....  
I agree that this could turn out to be vaporware... it's very ambitious. 
However, the developers would like to get paid for building this platform and be able to support it for the next few years, until it either proves itself or fails. So yes, this could all end in tears or as another ponzi scheme, but there is nothing hidden about this and the original developers are just looking for a way to fund their initiative.
Calling this a scam is going too far. You're right that some people are being suckered in by the buzzwords, but from all the interviews I've read and seen, the founders are explicitly warning people about the risks. 
Vitalik Buterin who started with the Ethereum whitepaper has repeatedly said that everybody is allowed to start their own implementation. If you can do it better without asking for funding, you are welcome to do the same...

It solves the age old problem of never being able to trusting a single party for 100% to provide correct information. This is done by making *everything* transparant. Only the information which is accepted as truth by the *majority* of all users will be considered correct information. The result is that all users around the world combined are the ones making the rules.
The rules of Bitcoin can therefor not be regulated by a single country. You can only make laws for people in your country that define how they can use it.
Another thing you may want to stress is that eventhough bitcoins are not a 'currency' in legal terms. They **only** purpose of them is for use in transactions, which makes them a currency by very definition.
The problem is thus that the legal term 'currency' and the actual definition  of 'currency' in our language are not the same.

Think of share holders in a company. Their shares pay dividends... bitcoins don't. Unlike properties, you can't enjoy owning bitcoins until you spend them. If people want to enjoy their new wealth, they'll *need* to spend it. Unless they keep being early adopters of other revolutionary technologies or businesses, their wealth will only be reducing and level the playing field.

Price matters because the larger the market cap, the easier it can be used to move large sums over a longer period of time. 
Currently we need almost instant conversion to avoid price volatility... And although that is technically already being solved with consumer and merchants services (the internet and speed of Bitcoin make volatility in transacting almost a non issue) they still get a piece at every conversion. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:29:19


For now, I'm happy that more businesses are accepting payments with Bitcoin.
The next step is going to be customers requesting multi-signature payments from processors like Bitpay and Coinbase. You'll be able to pay into a multi-sig address and the processor will not sign until the mechants hands over proof of delivery. The merchants may complain at first or charge higher fees, but in the long term this will be a way for merchants to deliver better quality service.

I don't think Bitcoin will win big on intellectual arguments. Most don't understand hypotheticals. People like the STORY of a successful, caring movement for something that makes sense to use. Only when they can identify with that story, will they take it seriously.
The best way to get a positive story out is to portray it as the underdog that keeps winning ground. In a way that people actually start rooting for it in an old fashion all American dream hero-type story.
No matter how disgusted you may feel about that... it works.

Why would somebody who has been working 2 years in secret, publish a paper anonymously, only to blog publically about something similar, but still different, a few months later and then again release the software anonymously and never identify himself.... Nick has also denied being Satoshi.
If Nick Szabo is not Satoshi, then it's actually possible that the latter 'stole' his idea and made it into a reality. Could also be the reason why Nick updated his blog, to clarify that he came up with the idea *a long time ago*.

To me it seems like Bitcoin makes it more efficient to go after the big spenders. People who lead a luxury life or use their money for power will be scrutinized more than people neclecting to pay taxes on tiny amounts they spend.

Not YET ...
Tools to do this **will** be available in the future.
It's possible to make it very hard for those types of tools if you cover your tracks, but these will have statistical analysis to group similar transactions together  based on taint, size and time of transaction. A single slip up is all that's needed.
The blockchain and whatever you spent in the past will be permanently available for future researchers to study.
If you're celebrity and worried about this, I really advise against using this to pay for anything you don't want to become public some time in the future.

That's just a nonsensical claim. All public addresses are everywhere there is a blockchain or sometimes don't even exist in the blockchain until a transaction is made.

I hope blockchain technology continues to prove itself useful. 
Although I don't think Bitcoin will fail, I do acknowledge the possibility that either the game theory can be cracked or math catches up to break all of cryptography. 
But sofar Bitcoin has already accomplished far more, far sooner than many people ever thought possible. I think that qualifies as success by itself.
So I hope people would stop saying this as if the jury is still out without specifying how they would define a success or failure.
The most likely scenario to me is that in a decade or two, the established powers will find ways to coinvaildate and turn it into a tool for their own bidding. People will have to start all over again like they now need to do with privacy on the internet and the existing security architecture.

Anonymity is unfortunately not one of the strong points of Bitcoin. Your transaction information is less private than your bank details and every payment ever made is permanently recorded for as long as Bitcoin exists available for future analysis. Don't use it for anything illegal because you are basically leaving your DNA at the scene. 
Fortunately that was not the intended goal. The reason Bitcoin was invented was to eliminate the middlemen. The way this is solved is by putting the trust in the network of users. As long as more than 50% of the users are honest and makes the right decisions to secure the network and in doing so protect their money, it will remain safe. 
The only way to make this possible was by making every transaction public. That's why not needing to use your real name is important because it protects your privacy up to a certain  point.

1MB is an arbitrary number too. You could argue that it may already be too high for mobile internet connections. I think people are searching for the best balance for decentralisation. So since internet speeds around the world are increasing, why not find a way to increase the blocksize to keep up with the same ratio to average consumer internet speeds around the world as it is now?
Introduce a patch which would incrementally increase to a maximum blocksize of 20MB over the next year and revert or ajust it when it turns out that average internet speeds around the world are stagnating.

That drama is mostly caused by non-devs who feel threatened by an alternative blockchain or people worried about any investment they might - think they - have (and honestly, I think was being overly sensational in his wording)
Seriously, the choice of the Ethereum team to use a separate blockchain was well thought-out and doesn't mean they wouldn't like to see it on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is such a new technology that people just pick what works best for them at the time they do it. 
Since all of the code is open-source, I really don't see why there is any need for calling it a competition. Everybody is just picking of each others' code to make the best system they can, which we can then all use.

What Bitcoin accomplished in the last 5 years may already be unique, because it grew under the radar and was the only credible option for so long.

Every blockchain based tech goes through a vulnerable phase of a growing userbase in which it everything from a 51% attack up to unfair distribution can leave it with a bad reputation.

Actually, if that person uses an offline wallet, it is more likely that they are related and means you now know more about the amount of bitcoin this person controlled. If you are able to figure out what they bought, you now now more about the contents of their wallet.
If somebody does a tumble or a coinjoin, you have no idea where the money went... unless there is a single output somewhere equal to all the inputs which you know came from that wallet.
Statistical analysis is not just about following the addresses, but also about amounts, times when they were and were not used.
If there is a transaction made from an address when the suspected owner isn't behind a computer or smartphone, you can practically rule them out as the person that controls that address.
When you send $3000 worth of bitcoin in a transaction for somebody and this person starts spending from this address for coffee, overstock items and groceries... simply by looking at the blockchain you can already make an educated guess which amounts are being spent and which amounts stay in control of that person.

Many providers know that their goods are being used for illegal purposes. Glue manufacturing companies don't stop serving to certain shops because many glue-addicts shop there. It's the responsibility of the shop to stop selling to the addicts. And it's also the responsibility of the shop to order only the maximum allowed amount of glue per day. If the glue manufacturer points out holes in the system, that is their right. Even having their suspicions... without proof it doesn't suddenly make them complicit.
I understand the point of view written in the indictment, but considering we are talking about early 2012, before FinCEN or any government agency even defined bitcoins as money and the fact that BitInstant was already trying to comply with MSB licenses as much as they did, sure makes this case highly questionable. 
Even after having read the supposed e-mails that were sent, nothing in there proves that Charlie was supporting drug-trade. He was telling the person reselling the bitcoins to stick to the maximum and if he really wanted, he should work around it by using multiple e-mail addresses... but nowhere does Charlie actually mention proof that he knew.. only suspicion. As an MSB you need to report suspicious behaviour, but what qualifies as suspicious behavior? The mere fact that you suspect something? Or does a client need to meet certain requirements?

Nice animation, but.. again much of the same information left out which leaves people with too many questions for them to care:
* It only talks about increasing the difficulty, not about decreasing it
* It implies that only in 2140 transaction-fees will start to become important, while in practice it must be a gradual process starting from today.
* The transactions are animated being relayed by the miner being the third party, while in practice - everybody gets the transaction.
* It doesnt mention the fact that miners will need to be honest in their confirmation, because otherwise the rest of the (majority of the) network won't accept it.
* This talks about 'finding' bitcoins by miners, where the truth is that as a reward for creating a valid block, a miner is _allowed_ by the rest of the network to create a transaction of bitcoins to themselves.
...  which will prevent people from realising what it means for it to be truly decentralised. This way it still seems like some single entity controls some aspects of the Bitcoin rules behind the scenes. I think this sentence will clarify it better:

From what I've learned sofar in Either:
- Bitcoin is property, so you pay VAT and gains tax and make it difficult to use as a currency.
- Bitcoin is currency, so it's more heavily regulated and make it difficult to start a business selling it.
In both cases it can be considered money for extra regulation if it suits the government and it's not considered money if it doesn't suit them.
All very confusing

Still that doesn't mean that the Lightning Network isn't a worthwhile infrastructure addition to the Bitcoin economy. I even think it's worth switching to SegWit for this. Not having to waiting for 10 minutes and increasing the volume a thousand-fold and even getting more privacy in some cases is more than enough reason to pay for micro-transactions.
I just don't like the idea that we'd be stuck with an non-flexible block-size and having to go through a community at war everything there is a desire to increase throughput. I think that can be outsourced to the protocol itself... but I guess we'll see what happens when Ethereum becomes too popular for it's own good and the gas limit keeps growing. If that becomes too centralised and thereby corrupted (by systematically censoring transactions) it's proof that you can't trust miners with that power.

That would allow the Chinese to sell them on US or European exchanges. They have been unable to do so for a while now and probably keep buying in the mean time.

On chain isn't a requirement for it to be used as currency. Just as soon as period it as a medium of account, that should be sufficient.

The Bitcoin [whitepaper]( talks about _"a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server"_, but because it also contains more items than a single reference, the contents of each document is called a block. 
So the idea of linear hash chaining the contents of Merkle trees isn't really new. Only the application to apply it to a ledger transaction log is. 
Although I would argue that Git (2005) [did something similar before]( but instead uses snapshots instead of transactions.
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:23:40
Both Bitcoin and bitcoin transactions are scalable.
Bitcoin, the consensus network can scale in:
- Throughput. But it's limited by networking overhead. So either smaller transaction types or increasing the block size will only get it so far, until it's not possible for a power user to validate the network anymore.
- Security. There is a low barrier of entry. Once a pool goes bankrupt or gets a bad reputation, another will quickly spring up of the difficulty just goes down. Any increase in value of BTC will just attract more miners to secure the network. 
Transactions with bitcoin the unit can scale up to an unlimited amount depending on 2nd layer possibilities. 
But those have other risks, some more than others. With Lightning Network probably having the the lowest security risk, although depending on the user interface, could lead to accidentally losing funds by making stupid mistakes as a user.

Assuming this is supposed to be an Ethereum-style signature and the first byte 'v' would need to be either 27 or 28 (0x1b or 0x1c), you can immediately see that this is not the case. You can perhaps use the following link for verifying other signatures:

True. But you can close the channel any time, so technically it's hardly out of your hands. But unlike a promise, you indeed can't actually spend that money twice on something else. Some companies make money on the risk they take of making promises based on money they don't have. That will not work here.


Yes, unless you can get the other party to agree to close the channel early. If you communicate that you're not going to make any further payments, they have no reason to keep it open except if they want to spite you.


I don't see why that's true. Could you elaborate?


Not in a regular Bitcoin transaction, but with the Lightning Network, the idea is that your micro-payment gets sent to the party you want to pay over a network of payment channels. Somewhat like correspondent banking. Here is a video to explain: 


Yes, this could be a problem if there aren't other solutions in the future. It all revolves around duration and number of users. As it becomes more reliable, more users come into the system, but the duration can also increase. Still for 7.4 billion people with 2 transactions every year, you end up with. (7,400,000,000 * 2) / 365 / 24 / 6 = ~280,582 transactions per block.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:23:42
It won't. Let's assume there's 10M transactions per day, it won't be evenly spread over those 24 hours, so let's assume double the rate at peaks (probably more) which is 300 transactions per second. That is something that can probably be handled by 2 or 3 servers.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:17:45
That's a mischaracterization. He wants cheap and fast payments now, without freezing accounts. He wants it now and said that LN doesn't provide it, which is correct for the time being. He also believes that long term on block scaling has a higher chance of success.

This was tried around 3 years ago and I was a proponent of this at the time, but using mBTC (milli-bitcoin) doesn't turn the conversation away from *"what is a bitcoin?"*. And after having seen the experiment ( uses it by default) - not even I as a proponent was able to stop using the term `bitcoin` as a currency denomination. The idea to use only `bit` or `satoshi` (as was also suggested at the time) might have taken us further, but by now the language is probably too far embedded into the culture.
* `Bitcoin` = longest chain on its protocol
* `bitcoin` = 100,000,000 satoshi
* `millibitcoin` = 100,000 satoshi (mBTC)
* `bit` = 100 satoshi (μBTC) - might be too generic
* `satoshi` = smallest possible unit (currently) - there will be 2.1 quadrillion of them

Yes it's far from ideal. Fortunately there are discussions on improving this process [EIPs to make it look more like the BIP process.
The protocol as a whole is specified rather well down to the bit-level, but this latest change to the protocol had some urgency because the bloated state database was causing users to have problems catching up to the chain and was done relatively hasty.
This further proves the saying: "Haste makes waste"
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:31:06
In practice it doesn't mean much though... if all bitcoins were cut in half and 8 million bitcoins would be in existence today, each could be worth double. If we would measure gold prices in kilos instead of ounces, bitcoins wouldn't come anywhere near. 
Functionally it doesn't matter. The total market value is a different story. Reaching 1% of the gold market would be a huge milestone. But yeah news articles may pop up all over the place, despite its irrelevance.

No need to get worked up, if you don't want to upgrade... don't upgrade. It's still possible to just use Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 and ignore the bigger blocks. Sure transactions might be replayed on the other chain, but you can just ignore that if you think the &lt; 1MB chain is more important. If what you say is true.. and most users don't want to upgrade, then SegWit2X will just be ignored and become worthless.

They can track anything coming from that address, but they don't necessarily know who you're sending it to. Usually in a transaction, the entire balance is spent so that you have 2 (or more) new addresses.
And as for taxes, government don't always know exactly what you're supposed to pay, but if you live in more luxury than your taxes indicate you will be investigated.

They can, but healthy competition makes each other stronger. Bitcoin has both the advantage of being predictable and disadvantage of being relatively older tech for more advanced and complex transactional structures. Bitcoin is limited, but mostly because you often don't need more than basic multi-sig or time locks. On the other hand, it's much more difficult to efficiently program alternative transaction rulesets. In the long term it could all be possible with Bitcoin, but right now technological stability is the main priority. Also for each PoW algorithm there can probably only be one.

Except that the recipient of the cash doesn't rely on the issuer that they received the cash.

It's more like *delayed on-chain transaction settlement*. Basically everybody sends each other Bitcoin transactions, but the other party decides not to publish them to the network in the hope to receive newer transactions with a higher value in exchange for more products &amp; services.
There is no other chain except for the Bitcoin blockchain, so I wouldn't call it a side chain. And it's not really off chain, because eventually the last transaction should be settled on chain. But yes, you delay the publication so it's temporarily off chain.

I agree with this, but this case isn't about that. 
It's about how to treat bitcoins as currency, which is fungible and single notes are not allowed to be tied to individuals for ownership laws... or as goods which do give individuals rights on specific items under the law, which means that when you have proof that somebody has a particular item of you, you can claim that entire item back.

Well that is the real question here. I'd like to know what the courts would need for you to claim (or for that matter, prove ownership of) a certain address or the bitcoins which were in there at one time. 
It seems like proving you have control over it with the private key isn't enough, because in some cases these can be guessed and so you can't prove who generated it first. That makes it rather difficult to make a distiction between somebody stealing and just helping themselves to money in an address that they already controlled. It may well have been a payment or a donation.
Seems to me like it's somewhat like dropping gold in a treasure case in international waters in a location that only you know. And then when somebody else moves it to another location in international waters that only they know, you claim that it was yours to begin with. Then it's just your word vs theirs. You need lots of circumstantial evidence, because addresses are never tied directly to a person.

I still think $3500 is a possibility in the near term. 
Remember that the mid-Dec-2013 crash and 2014 bear market took until end of 2016 to recover back to $1000. That's 2 full years. And every bear cycle has taken longer to recover. In that time, you could argue that the lowest point was $152 Jan 14th 2015. Later that year after it went all the way up to $317, it went back down to $198 on Aug 24th. A few months later $502 on Nov 4th, then back down to $294 a few days later ^[1].
The last ATH was Dec-2017, so it could take until at least 2020 before we even see anything near $20000 again and hover there for many months, meanwhile, ups and downs in the near term can be anything between $3500 and $6000. 
Now the market has matured a lot in the mean time so fluctuations of 20% in a day will be more rare, but that also means it could take even longer before we see ATH again.
Get ready for a bumpy ride.

The adjective _'rich'_ is given here because Bitcoin is rather limited in that department (on purpose, because it was a large attack surface) but the community at Ethereum is willing to take that risk and is still trying to tune it to perfection.

_"Your keys, your bitcoin"_ is not entirely correct. Because it could happen that you have the keys but the bitcoins were not intended for you
_"Not your keys, not your bitcoin"_ is not correct because somebody could have moved the bitcoins to a new address and you might still think they are legitimately yours (otherwise it wouldn't have been theft)

While I don't think it's really worth the effort for a big screen TV (you need to send your double spending transaction to a larger mining network than the original transaction, you'd have to do it in seconds and it would trigger alarms at the original merchant if they see two competing transactions) ultimately yes, it's taking a higher risk.

@_date: 2017-04-16 07:10:23
This may be more in line with the goal of [one-cpu-one-vote-rule]( where basically everybody with equal participation in the system should have equal voting (mining) power. But it became clear pretty early on that this would not hold.
That is still the ideal for many people out here (including Roger if I interpret his tweet correctly) so that's why more ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithms have been developed.

It isn't the same asset though. It's one step removed. Receiving access to a multisig wallet also isn't the same as fully receiving BTC in a single address. There's always added risk.

I wouldn't be surprised if BTC hits 3000$ and back up to 6000$ all the way through 2019. Then maybe.... maaaaybe if Lightning Network really starts to take off in payments everywhere online, it could go all the way back up in 2020.

I very much wanted to see larger blocks back in Bitcoin, but I was always aware of the risks so was hesitant. Now that I've seen them in action with Bitcoin Cash &amp; Ethereum, I finally believe that they're a red herring. Block increases will never be enough to scale up to global demand.
Even if the miners have the opportunity to vote for bigger blocks like in Ethereum, they won't because of the risk of orphans. It will naturally grow over time with the increase of bandwidth and computing power, but never enough to support all internet payments.
Bitcoin could have stayed united if the block size was variable by miner voting and then the whole discussion would have faded away because the majority of miners don't benefit from larger blocks.

- Users can then buy coffee with Liquid bitcoins on the sidechain 
- Bakkt also creates a merchant processing tool for Starbucks 
- All Liquid bitcoins spent on coffee, will immediately be sold off to an exchange.

I get your concern about deflation. The only correct way to encourage a productive society is by forcing people to make investments. However you can't trust that control to a small group of people. Ideally you'd have a fully resource based token society where any derivative asset is based on those resources. 
I think that the bitcoin doesn't have the function of a store of value anyway. It's a resource you need to write to the Bitcoin (similarly to how Ethereum sees ether)
Eventually we don't just want a productive society but one that is balanced. Something that maximizes people's opportunities, but is restricted to the long term goals of a community.

Not entirely though. You're buying a (high) chance of eventually receiving the full amount of bitcoins in an address. It's still backed by your own vigilance.
With regular BTC you need to keep track of a private key. With Lightning BTC you also need to keep track of the settlement tx. However it's such a minor risk that the exchange rate should be near 1 at all times.
So it might be that people would lower their prices if the payments was done onchain vs offchain. That really depends on the market price that develops for services to be vigilant for you.

It's understandable why he did what he did. Since some people just want to see change sooner rather than later. Bitcoin is playing the long slow game. That doesn't get people moving in the short term. 
He's a beacon of light for many business minded people that have regulations to worry about. In the mean time, what they're building has direct practical uses and is actually improving processes.
It might not solve the fundamental problems of the world economy caused by central bank money, but Corda certainly does pretty much everything else that people expected from 'blockchain' while it doesn't even use one.
While enterprises move over to Corda, the bitcoin might slowly become the world's new decentralized bank money, used for frictionless value transfer over the internet. I see them integrate at one point, where digital Corda contracts are backed up by bitcoins for collateral.

That's how most software developers work. They only want to deliver perfection and everytime you get closer you understand a little bit more about how it's not perfect yet. Scope creep. 
What would have been good enough from the start turns out to have minor bugs that only become apparent when coding and testing them.
It is never done, only finalized at a point where the devs feel comfortable that they aren't releasing anything that could break in any significant way.
The only way around this to release and finalize small chunks of code that work well. Unfortunately network effect often means that you end up working against the popularity of your own previously released inferior product requiring a lot of overhead to just create a proper upgrade path.

In what I gather the exec meant that transferring bitcoins will be a popular unit of account (if only for the computer). But the actual technology used could be Lightning and not Bitcoin (which would only be used for settlement). 
The inconsistent use of Bitcoin (capital B) the network and the bitcoin (lowercase b) the unit of account, and the fact that this article has headlines with all words capitalized doesn't make it very easy to read.

I've been experimenting and it's already much better than 4-5 months ago. Haven't seen routing issues since August.
Receiving however still requires you to create a channel yourself (let's say $100) and then you dan only receive the amount you've already spend. And you need to create invoices for everything you receive. You can't just give out an ID to which people can pay.
I think some of this might be solved by smart ways to set up a channel without needing any bitcoin yourself. You could pay somebody in dollars to set it up for you with a large capacity, but without actual coins. That way you can earn money up to capacity on your channel.

Is isn't a Bible, but to me it's the specification of what Bitcoin is. All consensus networks that use a protocol that matches that specification are still Bitcoin. Only the consensus network running the Bitcoin Core software (version 0.17.0.1) gets to call it BTC imo.

I agree with the decentralisation argument, but more than that I think that the value of a decentralised network is much higher than the fees we are paying at the moment for the privilege of immutability. I would rather have fees increase than risk becoming more centralised.
I don't agree however with the notion that a hardfork is automatically an altcoin. Especially not in the case of the blocksize which is not part of the integrity and technically just a node configuration.

One thing I've learnt is that forks are not the enemy. They are just two groups of people coming together deciding on different paths. Sure it divides the community and thus makes it vulnerable, but it's also evolution and may the strongest protocol win. The goal is to eventually come out bigger and stronger than before. Sometimes that risk is worth it.

I think the point is that people don't want that extra step, because it makes your wealth less liquid. I think that the whole token economy (the way Sweetbridge describes it) can go a long way with that. But yeah using just the bitcoin as a unit of account may not be the best for an economy, but with more liquid tokenized assets and because of the better characteristics of the digital token (divisible, portable, programmable) I think it's a good tool. And as for the main point, deflationary.... I think it's good that no small group of powerful people can decide this for everybody else in the world. That would be too much power.

I think that Core still has a lot of power after SegWit2x (as said before, their organisation has been trusted with development of Bitcoin for a long time and has made a lot of people happy) so if Bitcoin1x is not viable anymore, they could easily gain back power of development by including the SegWit2x changes into Core and release 0.16.0... then most people would probably prefer to keep trusting Core instead of BTC1.
Another possibility is changing the proof-of-work mechanics for Bitcoin Core and starting over from a weaker position, but slowly gaining back trust by continuing development and slowly building out the economy again. With their track record, they might be able to pull it off, but I have not seen an agreed emergency plan for this.
There's this: 
In case SegWit2x becomes the chain with the dominant hashrate, then Core might also also be forced to fork with replay protection and give up the BTC ticker.

@_date: 2018-03-24 13:59:43
Accounts could also just disappear by the mere fact that with shared ledgers using digital signatures (not blockchains) fraude can be tied much closer to a digital identity. Then all you need is a single digital identity, of course with all the privacy preserving mechanisms that wealth can't be tied to a person unless you want to explicitly proves it per instance.
Digital identity (with uniqueness, preventing any type of sybil attack) is a really scary thing though. One single vulnerability and your whole life is in de hands on somebody else. Much worse than identity theft these days. Until we have a perfect system, I'd rather have systems without legal identities at all.

Despite the hatred against Core, that's not the issue here. I'm sure enough bad things can be said about all the haters too.
This has been a fight on how to scale and that has been "SegWit" vs "larger blocksize" for almost 2 years now. This is just an attempt by a group of people that think they can unify everybody by compromise and back **both** ideas.  
Bitcoin is a decentralized currency network. It needs a majority to change the rules. If it turns out they were wrong, they'll continue knowing that they tried and that the majority didn't want it after all. Some of them might actually start using Bitcoin Cash. If it turns out they were right, we'll see what Core does, but ultimately it's not their decision. Wasn't the mascot a honey badger? Just cast your vote by using the one you like best.

Are there downsides to having multiple citizenship?
If you get citizenship in a different country, would that be communicated to your original country or to other countries? 
So for example, some countries don't allow or make it difficult for people from certain countries to enter. Like being from the U.S. can make it easy to get into many countries, but difficult in others.
Now you could use your second citizenship for those places, but would they know your other citizenship? So I'm wondering if it is really that helpful.

It's actually they opposite. If you get disproportionately more than others, status and fear become another factor and creativity goes down again.

I think the point is that you're not sending them from Canada to U.S.A. - you're just publicizing the transaction from input addresses to output addresses. That transaction will go all over the world and people from every country that run nodes will verify this. Not until somebody spends one of the output addresses will the money have switched borders. So the person spending the money is responsible, not the person sending the money.

This could be a little controversial, but one way would be to democratically vote for a pool of candidates (not all candidates need to be committers) Then let those candidates rate each others' work.

Coinbase is not an exchange, but a vendor. The risk that Coinbase will go bankrupt or offline in the upcoming crash is considerably lower. But yes, if you have more than just a bit of spending money on Coinbase, you should download a wallet that only you control and send your coins to an address from that wallet. 
As for security, your own PC might have less security than Coinbase does, so in case you're taking about an amount that you really really don't want to lose, create an address on a PC that is not (and better yet, will not be) connected to the Internet and send it there.

If Ross actually did such a thing, I wouldn't mind seeing him in prison. Doesn't matter a lot if it was entrapment (unless he knew it was fake and played along).

Well this is going to be an interesting case, because Bitcoin itself might be considered outside of the jurisdiction of the FBI and they would offer no protection to somebody using keys that were considered private by somebody else.

I understand that Silk Road and paying on the "Deep Web" is a great symbol for the freedom that Bitcoin brings along. And knowing how seemingly innocent personal information can always be turned around and be used against you at one point, I'm also a great advocate of ~~anonymity~~ privacy.
But am soo sick and tired of Bitcoin being associated with drugs and illegal actions in general. I have personally never used bitcoins for anything that is considered illegal by most western countries and I don't intend to. Yet I am still a big proponent of Bitcoin as a way to bypass third parties for economic reasons and in my case, ease of use (not needing an account and just paying is faster for me).
People keep asking why companies and the masses are hesitant about using Bitcoin?  I think it's not about ease of use, but because they fear it since it's being associated with drugs, ponzi-schemes and criminals in the media.

I'm saying that if you only boot up BIP148 UASF nodes, you'll diverge later when the 2x part of BIP91 should be activated. If you want to make sure miners hold up the BP141 part of BIP91, they want to see that the 2x part will also be accepted... Otherwise they risk only activating SegWit but not getting the 2x.

You said it yourself. Bitcoin isn't regulated, only the ways in how you are allowed to use it.

Ethereum had one serious chain split after EIP-158/EIP-161  and despite what happened, it was solved by having the longest chain survive (which happened to be a nicer implementation)
The risk of forking is there, but in my opinion, the effort of formalizing and the possibility of other clients competing outweighs the rigid attitude of snubbing other implementations. 
You'll run into the same dilemma when upgrading and old version to a new version. And if I remember correctly, you've had exactly that once before.

One thing Ethereum has taught me is that developing multiple compatible implementations of the same protocol is _absolutely_ a good idea. Implementing the same concept in multiple languages gives you a very good idea of all the assumptions, limitations and possibly even bugs in one language.
However when running multiple implementations and there are discrepancies, it's very difficult to point back to the paper describing how it's supposed to work when the incorrect implementation is churning out the longest chain. You can't turn back time, so either accept the bug... or fork to make sure that future blocks don't have the issue. Most users will have an incentive to keep an eye on the most popular implementation, so might end up running two versions, which isn't uncommon (Etherscan is running both Geth &amp; Parity)
I think it's a nuance that should be mentioned. Implement something in multiple languages, but the chain securing the most value

4 years ago, the community was set on getting Bitcoin to grow with new applications and use cases. This time around, it just seems to be hype and pumping.

No that's not the difference. You are not forced to use Lightning. Once somebody sends you bitcoins over LN you can close the channel and spend it on chain. The only difference is between the time that you receive it and the time it takes to close the channel. In that time, the counterparty can try to cheat you. If you don't get a transaction in before the time-lock runs out, you'll lose the coins. LN bitcoins come with a slightly higher risk. Not anything I would worry about, unless the amounts are higher than you can afford to lose.

- New York Consensus conference / blockchain week

- USDT distrust got people buying bitcoin to get rid of them. As long as BTC is rising its tempting not to sell.
- Too many people getting hurt by shorting too soon, thinking they can cash in on the inevitable drawback.
- People were on the sideline after the 2018 crash waiting to see whether the cryptomarket would survive. The past few months have been slowly gaining speed. Resulting in FOMO by those actively waiting. The masses are not here yet.

You're not fully wrong. In many cases, especially now in the early days, this is a likely scenario. You are wrong in the assumption that it will always be this way.
Sometimes large groups of people don't recognize how bad the situation really is until it's too late (climate change, overfishing, using all the resources) and also dinosaur companies that don't innovate anymore.

Don't be so sure. If Bitcoin is made illegal for all transactions it's different from BitTorrent being illegal for certain files. All internet at your ISP will be filtered at the protocol level... Nobody will be able to publicly deal in BTC anymore. Forcing it to remain niche for a very long time until people in the banking I industry find a way to make money on something like Bitcoins (by being the early miners) 
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:34:09
"explain it all" would be a little much.
A good start would be buying a very small amount. 
Perhaps take 1$ or $10 and buy it from a friend or an exchange.... or try to earn it by providing a service for somebody. Take those bitcoins, experiment with it and if it gets stolen it's not a huge deal.

I think most people would have the same problem with Mi(c)keys and Satoshis. I think that it's more accessible and acceptable to people if you start calling the base units "[credits](
I'd like to expand on that and from now on it might be easier to just explain that 1 BTC exists of 100.000.000 credits and for ~3.000.000 credits you can buy a Big Mac. That will people get interested, because they'll be able to buy a lot of credits for just a dollar. Much like the early days of Bitcoin where 10.000 'units' bought you a pizza.

Trace is spot on with his comment about free speech and any legislation would be too broad or too vague. Yet I've learned enough about the world to be cynical and know that laws are not made or interpreted to be fair, they are made to keep power in place.
Fortunately Bitcoin is global. This means that the US could shoot itself in the foot by trying to ban it from people using it. If other countries around the world continue using it and Bitcoin survives the test of time, this could leave the country in a very disadvantaged position.
One tactic, which is probably already in progress, is to associate all the public keys in the blockchain with ah identity. Either directly or by taint.
I'd say on the short term expect laws to be proposed which would make the sales of dollars, good and services in exchange for math-based currencies illegal within the next few years. Unless they can convince all other countries around the world to do the same, which I doubt will happen, this is probably not going to last longer than 5 to 10 years.
After that the necessary infrastructure might be in place to allow Bitcoin, but only with strong regulation where all used addresses need to be registered and heavy penalties if you don't comply.

Ofcourse they have something to gain, but they won't do it because they are afraid of legal repercussions. They are traditional business and heavily regulated. That's why it have to be new types of businesses using the unique network of Bitcoin in a new type of way to create a product that couldn't exist before.
Don't just think of Bitcoin units as traditional purchasing power. It's also a de-centralized digital signature verification system. Each individual Bitcoin unit can be linked to a new range of applications. Automated systems that can justify their own existed by the ability to accumulate more bitcoins, self-driving cars negotiating overpassing eachother in exchange for some bitcoin units (miniature, but still costly if you add it all up)

Bitcoins are rare relative to the market acceptance of their value. If merchants don't accept them, they are worth less and other crypto-currencies are available in abundance to take its place.

Merchants are not investors by default.

- Is there a difference between ETH and BTC? (same PK algorithm secp256k1, similar consensus: PoW)
- Or difference between BTC and BCH? (same PK algorithm, same consensus, different block history) 
- Perhaps also BTC and BTC in a tumbler? (same PK algorithm, same consensus, same block history, different individual coin history)
- How about the difference between on-chain transactions and off-chain transactions? If not, does this mean you only have to pay VAT over the final settlement transaction and nothing over the individual lightning payments?
- How about ZEC in a t-address vs a t-address?
- How about an onchain ETH transaction that happens to result in a smart contract update that assigns ERC20 tokens to the address? (same protocol, same consensus, same history)
- Does it matter if it's done as two separate transactions or whether it's done as an atomic swap over a bridge? (basically seeing it as one big protocol)
- How about multi-signature BTC vs single signature BTC?

I encourage people to report any loss and see how the governments react. The fact that nothing has happened sofar speaks for itself. Maybe in the future when identities can more easily be tied to transactions.


Books and baseball cards are not bitcoins though. Bitcoin is borderless information without an authority. It's a new category.


Well I agree with this part. Context matters, but like I said: There are lots of things which are immoral but not illegal.


It might be, but you'll have to take all aspects of the system into account and don't try to just apply the national laws. Addresses aren't lockers, bitcoins aren't physical objects like basecall cards or cash, nor are they virtual goods (fiat currency or wow gold) which are tied to an identity through a central authority. It could even lend some ideas from intellectual properties, where the private key is just 'information' where you want to be the only one to have rights to use it.

This is my point. In the long term it doesn't matter that much. It's just a tool and governments or an elite will find a way to use it in their advantage and the same pattern happens all over again. And there are plenty of ways of doing so.
I am all for "power to the people" but history shows that the smart and powerfull end up grouping together to rule the rest.
This time it's NO different.
That said. I certainly think our current monetary system and power distribution could use a good shake and Bitcoin does have the potential. 
However most people don't care about politics, they just want a better life. So mainly it has worth because it's useful, not because it's political.

It's strange. Bitcoin feels so normal after it having been discussed fiercenessly in the press and I have seen so many postive reports in the past week alone that I moved on from worrying about the perceived legitimacy of using Bitcoin. 
And then I see David still defending it so severely, eventhough the interviewer didn't really sound negative about it. When asked about the possibilities of cybertheft, he goes on about not using the anonymity feature to give viewers the perception that it's not all shady.
I keep forgetting that it still has to be addressed because of the damage which has already been done by the press in early April and while the FUD may be less, it might come back again soon and by then you want the public to be informed.

No I don't. I'm asking how people (who think there is nothing different than usual) think it works. The government is only interested in amounts where benefits exceed the costs.
You already say something different than maxplm. He implies that the seller is responsible for paying taxes. If you say that the buyer is responsible for paying sales tax, then it's easy to tax.. because then we're not talking about a tax over the received bitcoin, but over the acquisition of material in a transaction, which is the same as usual.
However if it's the responsibility of the seller to collect and remit it, I see a problem, because you first need to identify the person(s) controlling the private key corresponding with the address receiving the bitcoins. Unless you want to move that responsibility over to the person negotiating the transaction in the name of the seller.

And I actually don't care by now. The paper, client/mining software, development process and decisions regarding forks have all been open. We don't need him to keep Bitcoin alive. But my compliments to him if he ever reads this.

You'd have to ask the people at OpenCoin. They have the largest control over the money supply. If and when they decide to distribute millions of XRP in circulation it will inflate the currency. 
As long as adoption is growing or remaining steady and there are no new XRP distributed, their prices will rise. 
TL;DR the XRP valuation doesn't depend on the open market but on whatever OpenCoin thinks is best for their business.

Enough with the "it is or can be used for illegal activity" already! All currencies can be and ARE used for illegal activity. That only validates it's usefulness. And zealots? Seriously? I'm so glad Bitcoin is the type of technology where early adopters will benefit greatly from being right and will get much more out of it than a mere "I told you so". 
Skeptics started scrambling in April, swallowing their words. But when it crashed, they came out saying: "We told you all along." When in fact Bitcoin has only been getting more adoption ever since. The next bubble will come along and another wave of skeptics will start wondering whether they should finally educate themselves instead of dismissing it based on cynicism. 
The people who refuse to educate themselves and keep up with their ridicule until it finally hits critical mass will actually feel their mistakes in their wallets, which is why I'm loving this.

The mistake people make is that everybody thinks they have time to sell during the first crash, but in reality the price is dropping so fast because almost NOBODY is buying. 
People here who say they will buy when it drops usually don't even have a number in their head when they'll buy. And that number usually drops after the value has gone down considerably. Now $50 seems ok, but when prices are still dropping fast, at that time $40 may seem a better deal... etc.
Look at how the actual crash went in 2011
If you look closely, there were two crashes. The first time it drops to 0.01. Then it bounces back up again but then it just keeps dropping for the next 5 months. Plenty of people will start to lose faith and rightly so. People now saying they will buy back, will have a reason to doubt whether the trust will ever come back.
I'm not saying this will happen again, but I do see a pattern and it's what I think people should be aware of.
Personally I'm confident in the long-term success of crypto-currencies, but its going to be a rough road getting there.

Does this mean you are not *allowed* to pay with bitcoins for goods and/or services or that they will tax you so much that it becomes uneconomic to do so?

New laws regarding software patents and rulings for downloading software had to be created before people were being fined or sent to jail over it. In plenty of countries around the world its still not illegal to download copyrighted media and software patents aren't enforced everywhere.
You are trying to argue that since its illegal in one country its illegal anywhere you do it. That's only from the eyes of the country where you perform that act.
To this day, not a single occurrence what you call theft has been punished. And I don't think it will happen until somebody with a lot of power puts their trust in the wrong key.
Right now most people in the Bitcoin community will tell you its your own fault for using a brainwallet with an easy to guess passphrase. That's basically a debate about the right amount of entropy before you are practically giving it away.

2) Which are likely vulnerabilities? SHA-256? &gt;50% attack?
3) What are features which would be superior to bitcoin? Perhaps if zerocoin or another in-protocol mixing service is implemented in an alt-coin before Bitcoin perhaps? or faster confirmation-times? Or smaller block-chain? Or would better marketing just be enough?
How about the difficulty of consensus? The miners are basically the ones that vote over changes to the protocol. What if people become too invested that their fear for breaking their cashcow, don't accept any new changes to the protocol and progress stagnates. What if this is inherent to all Bitcoin-like currencies?

If two people have knowledge of a private key and one person moves all BTC in a transaction to another address without consent of the second person. Should this be considered theft? And who should enforce this? Have there been any cases like this in court?

I am starting to think that altcoins can now function on the same level that Bitcoin did a few years ago, with the advantage of less social stigma. 
It's an uphill battle trying to convince people who are susceptible to branding and marketing to use the network with superior strength and a proven record they haven't even heard of. Other crypto-currencies are going to get bigger and more user who want to increase in value just like with Bitcoin. 
The winners in the end will be those  that manage to gain the trust of most users through reputation. 
Having first mover advantage and the biggest community which has lots of money at stake isn't necessarily an advantage in an experimental field which needs agility to survive. I'd say having money at stake should give the right incentive, but it could also induce fear and paralyze.

I absolutely agree. Being part of a state means you get to live by it's rules. If you don't agree with the rules you can either leave or try to improve them. There are (supposed to be) political means to improve government. The upkeep of a state requires money which can only be paid by taxes.
HOWEVER - the problem that most people have with government and taxes isn't that they are forced to pay....  but that it's to pay for so much _waste_. But because it's so difficult to pinpoint where the waste is coming from, they blame the whole system.
Hopefully a more transparant payment method with higher transparancy (like the blockchain) would make it possible to hold officials accountable.

I also notice that people don't understand the word 'reward'
A reward is usually given by somebody, but where do they come from? In reality, the miner (accountant that creates the transaction-page on the ledger) creates a transaction of 25BTC out of thin air to himself as a reward. The rest of the network will allow this as long as the page of transactions is valid.
Edit: Just saw your latest explanation and I think it couldn't have gone any better.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:01
No, but it could be used as glue between currencies.
- Customer uses Coinbase account with a dollar balance
- Merchant (chinese webshop) uses BitPay account with dollar amounts, but receives yuan
Both customer and merchant never see bitcoins, but everybody can enjoy the lower transaction costs and less capital controls. And the market can have more competition for both customer server and merchant services working on an international standard for 'cash-like' transactions over the internet.

Oh my god, such stupidity.
Yes the prices are inflated because of irrational speculation, but that doesn't make your other points valid. Having trust in math is usually a better bet than trusting people with your money. Bitcoin has the best chance of being the leading crypto-currency for a long time to come.
The DotCom bubble was bursting because people were throwing money around without thinking of immediate returns. Stupid decisions cost them a lot of money, but the internet flourished anyway because it was a really good concept.
Some of the companies who are currently investing in crypto-currency mining or exchanges are going to be the new financial leaders in the next 20 years.

I agree. Transactions are taxed, no matter what type of barter is used.

The conversions don't seem to be correct.

Apart from wallets, I think the public listing on **exchanges** should start being expressed in mBTC. That's what everybody uses to compare it to their previous currencies. 
So $1 gets you 9mBTC
or 1mBTC is worth a little over $0.11 cents
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:10:57
It's also a hedge against the security of the Bitcoin protocol.
If Bitcoin fails, it doesn't mean all cryptocurrencies fail. If it turns out that people invested in Bitcoin are not willing to change the protocol when it's needed, users have the possibility to choose an alternative.
I'm not sure why Litecoin deserves to be the  hedge though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:38:13
There are already competing currencies out there. If the market can't find a suitable fee and using Bitcoin becomes cumbersome, users will flock to another cryptocurrency with lower fees. It is in the best interest of people invested in Bitcoin to keep adding to the underlying infrastructure to make the system attractive to users.
By the way. If it turns out that the absolute maximum number of 21 million is threatening the end of Bitcoin, all the users can reach consensus to allow a new algorithm to create more bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-26 18:48:37
I found myself in agreement with the point the entire article.  Although I thought his remark:


... is completely wrong and uncalled for. It makes him appear ignorant. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:42:21


If it turns out that people start to realize that deflation is an aspect which hold back its usage as a currency, the majority of miners and nodes needs to be convinced to reach consensus and run software without a hard limit. A smaller already established crypto-currency will be ready to take over that part of Bitcoin, becoming the new dominant currency.
Same goes for other drastic changes like vulnerabilities in SHA256. You'd think that most miners would immediately switch to a new algorithm, but then their equipment would be worthless. So before the majority of the network will accept Scrypt as a valid way for proof-of-work, existing alt-coins which are already up and running could take over.
Point being. I don't fully trust the Bitcoin network to be smart enough for it's own good. Large networks of people tend to be slow in adapting even when their money is at stake.
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:47:44
I know! So that would be 24 hours per day.... 60 minutes per hour = 1440 minutes. 
144 blocks per day * 25 BTC = 3600 BTC per day. 
Which makes: (2.3 / 3600) * 100% = 0.064%
I made some mistakes with my verification. 
To double check, I somehow just multiplied 3600 BTC * 0.064% .. 
but should have done (3600 BTC * 0.064%) / 100 = 2.3 BTC

@_date: 2013-06-07 13:24:14
Nothing to worry about.
First of all, there are very very few entities in this world with enough money and/or resources to take over the Bitcoin network
Second, as soon as somebody uses that power, the rest of the network would notice right away and would either adapt or leave the network all-together, making all the bitcoins worthless. Another network would pop-up as there are plenty of alternative crypto-currencies.
The idea is that if anybody has that much processing power, it would be in their best interest NOT to take over the network, but use it to mine bitcoin for themselves, thus strengthening the network even more.
It's almost much much harder to destroy crypto-currencies than to profit from it if you have the computing power. For every single rich entity to be irrational about this, ten others would be rational and strengthen the network.

It won't be as stable as gold or the dollar has been. The establishment doesn't respond fast enough to incoorporate Bitcoin. It will take at least 5 years before the majority of people have used it and another 10 years to get the legal departements to understand it and accept it as a permanent factor in economic... but it will take a generation or two to understand the full impact of this new technology and what the new balance will be throughout times of peace, crisis and war.

This won't happen. Smart people diversify their assets and fiat currency may still have some advantages as a hedge against Bitcoin and other commodities. 
However, the balance is certainly going to shift and a lot of assets now invested in gold and fiat are going to be transferred into the Bitcoin network. So instead of $3 million per 1BTC... It might *only* end up more like $100.000 up to $1 million per 1BTC.
That is... if nobody with destructive intentions gains &amp;gt;50% of the hashing power or people start using a different crypto-currency, however unlikely.

Be carefull!!!!!!!
It might be the easiest, but it's also risky.
I know that bitaddress.org has been around for a while, and https is used by default, but still if you want to hold 1 BTC with less risk, I suggest you create that Bitcoin address on a PC without an internet connection or use secure wallet software.
You can download the bitaddress.org website by saving the web page. Then open it on a computer that doesn't have internet access or disconnect and use a private browser session to open the page.
You can find secure wallet software here:  
(Choose software wallets)
Then if you want to buy a Bitcoin, there are several ways to do this:
*  (find somebody in your area to exchange it for cash - be sure to look for good reputation and/or looks for signs that the person is not trying to rip you off)
*  (I have no experience with this, but many people have used it)
Other options are more difficult. You'll need to send your ID and money to an exchange and sell it there. It will take too much time.
Don't use e-Bay and don't offer paying with a PayPal-transaction, because unless they know you people will not able able to trust you with the option to charge-back your money.
Final option I can think of would be to offer your services to somebody in exchange for BTC.
Good luck!!

Happy to see you actually making an effort. The system is not perfect, but it clearly is something that many highly educated people are interested in, so it would be silly to dismiss it.
Trying to explain it as simple as possible is always a challenge. The problem is: It's not simple. And unless you find the exact correct analogies for technical terms like public key and blockchain, people will stay confused.
Here are some words you may want to avoid altogether to just use the alternatives instead:
* blockchain = public ledger
* block = page with transactions on the ledger
* private key = generated random password
* public key = receive address (unique for generated password)
* miners = accountants verifying transactions and creating pages on the ledger (new bitcoins are their reward)

Also note that if you don't have an external payment provider like BitPay or Coinbase auto convert the BTC to dollars, you will enter a whole new territory. Basically you are buying a bitcoin-transaction with your goods and services, valued at an unspecified approximation of an exchange-rate at the actual time of transaction, which means you might still have to pay barter tax. 
Germany already made it clear that Bitcoin is a currency, so there is no additional sales tax involved for buying bitcoins or Bitcoin transactions. But the U. S. hasn't. 
If you then sell the bitcoins or Bitcoin transactions for another currency you may still have to pay capital gains. 
If you create a new transaction in exchange for goods or services, you may need to pay both capital gains and sales tax.

It's more like patents. Like you have an idea and create a product, but somebody else has the same idea and creates a product first and dominates the market. With patents you are protected from that and only because there is such a law we call it stealing. There is no such law for Bitcoin private keys, so it's not stealing.

On the short term I see some serious issues though. The U.S. and other large economies will start trying to regulate Bitcoin to death.

It could very well be that the decentralized nature and economic philosophy behind the currency is not as strong as we think and it's eventually just as susceptable to a downfall though human corruption as any other system.

The problem is that bitcoins are public property. They exist as copies in a blockchain which can be downloaded (and controlled) by anybody following it's math. This means anybody with a private key has access to create a transaction.
A private key can be duplicated, so it could be considered intellectual property, however, there is no international authority which registers your ownership of this property to protect you when somebody else uses the same private key to transfer all the bitcoins to another address... so using the same logic you could dismiss it as personal wealth.
But you're probably right about the taxman... he'll just use any definition which serves him. I'm skeptical that you'll also be allowed to deduct from taxes and get protection from "lost" or "stolen" bitcoins. Which seems like hycrocracy to me.

The main challenge for Bitcoin is adoption. As with fiat money, it has no intrinsic value except the power of fiat. The state government has armies, natural resources and power of people to pay off the debt. The Bitcoin community doesn't have that power..... Yet. 
The only reason why I think there hasn't been a large crackdown is because people in power are convinced that it's a bubble that will pop or stay small like this. Bitcoin has many challenges to face... From alternative crypto-currencies with better marketing, scaling to millions of transactions per second and real government crackdowns.

Hi Matt, 
a couple of things never seem to come across well on TV whenever people are talking about Bitcoin prices and volatility. 
First of all, it is a payment network / protocol with its own units. The prices and volatility don't really matter for the payment network to function. 
Companies selling their products can have the coins instantly converted to dollars. 
With the speed of the internet neither party has to endure the volatility risk for more than a few seconds. And if the buyer and seller use the same payment provider, it could even be zero risk. 
This creates a whole new market for payment providers where previously you were forced to use the payment provider that the seller used or which the majority uses. 
people are investing in the currency unit because they think that when more people use Bitcoin, the demand will be higher. 
And for now that is the case, but as I stated above, with the right service providers, users of Bitcoin hardly need to hold the coins. This would drive the price back down, while maintaining the usability of the network. 
Second: People keep thinking in terms of buying whole bitcoins. That needs to stop. Just think in terms of the currency you prefer and buy for small amounts ($25 or $50 worth) if you really want to. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:05:58

Bitcoins are NOT directly related to your identity. Their use can however be traced and tied to specific identities.
If somebody makes a Bitcoin-transaction to an address of your choice in exchange for money, goods or services, then the address is associated with you, but not tied to your identity.

It has more properties of fiat money than that of gold, because the limitation is set by consensus (which is basically a different form of government)

I've seen cases where people created brainwallets with simple passphrases and within a couple of weeks there was BTC flowing in. Who can tell who had the private key first?
The BTC belong to a public key, not to a private key. This means _anyone_ with the private key can have access. Unless there is a government or court that is willing to specify who is/was the first to own which private key, I don't think you can call it private property.
So basically I agree with you if there is international law which specifies that private keys (just random numbers) can be considered intellectual property and are not allowed to be copied by anybody else but the owner. And people would be protected if this information is "stolen". But for now there is no such law.

In the future where transaction fee will be the incentive to solve blocks, how do we work around the problem where a transaction without a fee doesn't get confirmed anymore.

Mining is the process to earn bitcoins
The system is setup to pay out a block-reward on an average of 10 minutes.
If the network gets *more* computing power, blocks will be found faster than the average of 10 minutes.
Every 2016 blocks, there is a [recalculation of the difficulty]( based on the previous average. If the network has more processing power, the [difficulty]( will be higher. This means the security is higher.

If you really really want to use the physical property analogy (which I think really invites wrong assumptions) then consider this: There is a new oil field discovered in international waters. Nobody has legal rights to claim it. But the person who discovered it, sells the location to you, but instead of drilling the oil, you add a protection layer so you can get to it later. Then somebody else learns the location, is able to remove that layer and drills the oil himself. Did he steal it from you? Where is your legal right to that oil field?
In case you go looking for this particular example online: "Mineral deposits in these areas may be treated as available to whoever is willing to extract them, except where formal or informal international arrangements have been made to share these resources."
I can only see Bitcoin be treated in the same way.

If you look at the technical side of Bitcoin, you don't actually pay with BTC. You pay with transactions, which are signed messages (contracts) to the Bitcoin network. The validity of these messages are verified by the miners and added to the blockchain. Technically, you are never the official owner of a Bitcoin-address because everybody with the private key can access it, but you can request a transaction (contract) in exchange for goods and services if you trust that you are the only one who can create transactions originating from the new address.

Bitcoin is going to crash so extremely hard in the next few weeks, it's going to make a lot of people dizzy.
I have confidence in the crypto-currency philosophy and the developers have shown to be reliable and sofar the miners have shown to be willing to work together to keep a stable currency.
But as said before, people are still seeing this as an investment that can't go wrong and Bitcoin is volatile... it WILL go wrong. It might take months to bounce back, maybe even a year like after the previous bubble. It will hopefully come back stronger. However:
**Remember:** 
* Don't bet on Bitcoin themselves to change your life apart from any side-business you have in it or financial lessons you take away from it.
* Don't promise you family and friends golden mountains because Bitcoin still has perceived weaknesses and we still need to go through those in order for the currency to gain full confidence.

I don't think that will hold.
If you want to make that comparison, then compare it with a locker in international waters. A place without jurisdiction.

Now subtract from the 7 billion all the people who are too young, old, sick, poor or otherwise dependant to handle money.

That is probably because of the relatively high education of its users and their knowledge they are being traced. Once Bitcoin becomes more accessible, I expect that to change.

I think OP has a point.
* 1 can only be used once... and thus is scarce.
* 1.0 can be used 10 times, and is less scarce.
* Infinite divisibile units can be used an infinite number of times.
Bitcoins are valuable because they are useful as a tool for transacting. The more sub-units you have, the more times you can make transactions.
The solution lies in the fees. Because the miners require a little bit with every transaction, the number of transactions you can make before you run out of bitcoins is why divisibility will only get up to the point where it is necessary.

As you can see on the media in the past day, the discussion has moved more toward the utility aspect of the Bitcoin network. I think this is a sign that competitors to BitPay and TransferWise will be appearing soon.
The network created by the Bitcoin users is impressive, but already in the past year people have been discussing and questioning the philosophy behind it.
It seems to me that more and more [alternative]( digital - either centralized ([BitMint]( or decentralized ([PPCoin]( or iou-based ([Ripple]( - currencies will be appearing in the near future trying to improve upon Bitcoin. Each with their own philiosphy behind it trying get that same utility.
Within the next decades I can see competition arise in people trying to bet on the new currencies which might be best for society and could last well into the next century because of the underlying philosophy and sustainable economic model with new companies and services trying to incorportable these into the markets.
Political parties will have their own philosophies and will try to incorporate that into a new economic system and perhaps even enforce it. My view is that we're in for a wild and speculative ride and your assets should be as diversified as possible.
There was a book at the end of 2012 called "[Currency Wars]( - I just think we should now add decentralized currencies to the equation.

There are forks on the blockchain every day, usually because of newly found blocks propagating the network at the same time. If somebody creates a new client to put blocks on the existing Bitcoin-blockchain which are not allowed in the current network, this needs to be supported and used by 50% of all miners before it becomes a valid block and change in protocol.

This shows the problem of printing a private key.
If you transfer the bitcoin from that private key after you film it, it's not really stealing. You have knowledge of the private key, so you are also the legitimate owner of the bitcoin. Whoever makes the transaction first wins.
It's up to those with knowledge of private key to keep it secret, if they fail, they lose the bitcoin and there's nothing the law can do about that. They can prosecute a hacker for hacking, a burgler for breaking into a house, but there is no such thing as making an illegal Bitcoin-transaction (yet)

Bitcoin itself is not a scam. It's a really piece of marvelous mathematical and technological innovation. As far as I can see, the rules are resistant against anything except a malicious entity who doesn't act in his own self-interest. So it's basically the biggest experiment ever to see how far these economic rules are really true.
It's extremely high risk though, because nothing like this has ever existed and there is no telling how the world will react to it and where it will stabalize. Here is a known list of [Bitcoin Weakness]( So yes, it will be heavily subjected to huge spikes and probably great crashes. Especially after the euphoria wears off and major indicents start to occur.
However, like you said "any user has an incentive to bring new user in"- Talking only gets them sofar and at one point they will have to add real value to the bitcoin network by providing more exchanges and accepting payments for goods and services.
Because people own bitcoin, it's in their best interest to keep the network going. The gold rush will wear off and what remains is a more reliable, free and transparant economy compared to fiat currency in many ways.

Bitcoin is not an asset. All you can have is the private key, which is "knowledge". Knowledge can not be taxed.
The transactions are created in exchange for goods/services, so basically the transactions are the asset here. The value of a transaction can be expressed in bitcoins and thus taxed as a service.
I'd say transactions should be taxed as barter unless you exchange it for a currency, in which case it's taxed as income.

When transferring bitcoins, there is no way of knowing who controls the private keys of the new address until that key is used for a new transaction. So in case you just wanted to tax the person who actually has the private key, you would need to wait until that person uses it (and actually benefits from it).

No need to get upset. The people who are still willing to bet it all on Bitcoin, will be well rewarded for their risks. People who act like they are part of the "in-crowd" and hedge their bets as you describe will lose out. 
In the mean time, new people should be allowed to make up their own minds how they are willing to invest and should be fully aware of the risks. If you don't mention that Bitcoin has real competition, you're being dishonest.

I hope they don't use the regular analogies of sending coins and mining gold, but actually explain the distributed ledger, the democratic rule of &gt;50% processing power control over the network and the fact that you're actually paying with signed messages which need to be confirmed by that network.
That they explain the pseudonymity to a high degree and how the usage of Bitcoin for payments actually works easier for merchants (and lowers their costs by whole percentages) - and that the trust is entirely put into cryptography and the fact that the majority of people will act in their own best interest and thus securing the Bitcoin network.
This also means that if the security fails and somebody else creates a transactions from the address you thought you controlled, you are completely responsible for the perceived loss. Unless you hand over that risk to another company, which would mean you are basically going back to the traditional form of banking.
That digital goods like private keys can't be compared to physical goods, because they can be copied and backed up so you have new options to secure it and being in the possession of a private key doesn't guarantee exclusive ownership, because anybody with knowledge of the private key can make transaction from a certain address.

There is certainly an large element of self-interest causing the hype in the Bitcoin community. People advertising it as much as possible to get the price inflated. 
However, the majority is also absolutely convinced that switching to Bitcoin for a lot of use cases will benefit everybody. Lower average transaction cost and making transactions free as in speech and a more democratic money supply. More exposure will give more people the ability to experience the technology and understand the importance.
The price of Bitcoin.... that is only important to people who have direct access to lots it them. As a medium the price is irrelevant, but I'd say the network only benefits from having more users. It's like we're all using e-mail but we can't use it to communicate with our friends and the companies we use, where we still need to use postcards and letters.

My point is that if something is truly useful, people will use it and it will prevail. Crypto-currency doesn't need adoption to become stronger, it just is. The Bitcoin blockchain might fall, but I'm not particularly attached to that. When Bitcoin falls, Litecoin or another will take over. And if it doesn't, it means crypto-currencies weren't strong enough to survive in the first place.

OP seems to make the point that if you can divide it into 10 pieces, you can make 10 times more transactions. As its value comes from the utility for doing transactions, why would you care about having any more than 1 bitcoin if you have the ability to make an infinite number of transactions with them?
I think that (apart from the argument that people currently seem to think they purely have value because of supply and demand) the transaction fee actually limits the infinite divisibility to a point where it needs to be.... and also the limit on [dust transactions](

The blockchain isn't a locker, it isn't a bank account. Those are all designed for a purpose with owners who dictate their usage. Bitcoin has no owner, rules of transacting are set by the miners. And that is then either accepted or rejected by the nodes. But I agree with you: We'll find out at the first legal challenge.
However my opinion is that nobody should be punished for using any private key however they want, until it is dictated by law that you can't use specific keys in specific cases. And even then, I could travel to a different country without that law and do it there. My assumption is that for now, you'll just have to accept that this type of use of Bitcoin is legal. Just one of those reasons people keep saying: Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
And honestly, I don't see any way around it. Except for starting lawsuits that will cost more than they're worth. Just accept this as an inherent risk of Bitcoin and try to get as random keys as possible.

I agree with all your points and it's likely that this will continue for at least the next month, but if some major companies aren't going to directly accept Bitcoin soon, this whole venture can turn ugly. When people are going to need money to pay their taxes or rent and Bitcoin are not (yet) accepted, this may cause a downward spiral again.

Perhaps it would be nice if the public understands what Bitcoin really is, instead of what it is meant to be. 
Basically it's a huge file stored on the computer of everybody that participates. It contains transactions to public numbers which have a coupled amount. If you know the secret number that is mathematically linked to the public number, you can create new transactions that are validated by everyone who runs the software and it's added to the file.
Anybody can make changes to the software so it behaves differently, but as long as the majority doesn't use your version, the changes are ignored. This ensures the system always acts on behalf if the majority of its users. 
Because this system is very stable and mathematically sound, people can value the amounts in the transaction and exchange it for money. 
Effectively creating a form of digital cash.

Bitcoin it just a decentralized transaction system. Bitcoins are the currency on that system. That's all they are good for. The units are nothing **but** a currency on the Bitcoin-network.

None of the early adopters are anywhere near that kind of money. First of all, many (if not all) of them have been giving away or cheaply sold their mined bitcoins in order to get larger adoption. It is _their_ way of using their bitcoins in the past 3 years that made it what it is today. So I'd say they are doing a pretty good job.

You have "almost" complete control over your bitcoins. Anybody with the private key has the same level of control. Based on the theoretically astronomical chance that somebody has the same private key out of the same address space (2^256) you might as well consider it unique. 
However, we're not living in theory and private keys are generated with randomness based on the tools you have at your disposal. If anybody figures out how to reduce the amount of possible keys to something more feasible, you won't have as much control as you think you do.
An example is where people using private keys generated based on simple (combinations of) keywords which can be found in the dictionary or using a program that has bad random number generation.
You have in large part control over the the level of security you use, but not  absolute control.

I wish Bitcoin experts would stop saying *"nobody controls it"*.
It's very simple: Whenever somebody asks you *"Who controls Bitcoin"*, your first counter-question would be *"Which part?"*
**The software:** This is open-source, so anybody could try to run a modified version, but if it conflicts with the Bitcoin protocol, those changes are ignored. The Bitcoin Foundation is currently entrusted with maintaining the main branch, but whenever changes are made the majority of users disagree with... they have no power.
**Money creation:** Is done by all the people running the mining-software and everybody is free to do so.
**Network security:** This is verified by everybody running the Bitcoin software.
And the next time anybody says: *"We don't even know who Satoshi Nakamoto is"* the simplest would be *"You don't have to know, he disclosed everything about the system so you can learn everything about it yourself and for the past 4 year the most talented cryptographers and computer hackers have done just that"*

In order to see such a spike you'll need more people hoping for the same to happen. In that regard, much of the investment in bitcoins themselves is like a pyramid scheme. Yes, they remain useful and nobody is explicitly promising you returns, but many are hoping for it and need you to make it happen. 
I'm hoping Bitcoin gains more adoption if only to have an alternative payment method and currency. However, I cringe when people think about it as some kind of easy way to make money. 
If it's easy, expect there to be large risks. I can't emphasize that enough.

Volatility is only relevant in relation to time of holding. With internet speeds and the frictionless movement of Bitcoin, high volatility is far less of an issue. Users can use it as a competing online payment mechanism where **consumers and sellers don't hold any volatility risk** and leave it up to their respective payment providers.
This would used as a standard protocol where a consumer can use Coinbase or a competing payment provider, the seller can use BitPay, Coinbase, BIPS. Both can link their bankaccounts, creditcards (as long as the payment provider has the right compliance and KYC in order) - but people would still be free to buy or sell bitcoins for cash and use those to pay/receive online, without needing any payment provider.
The market for online payments would be truly open, instead of being forced to using PayPal or Mastercard/VISA in 99% of the cases.

I am talking about the government that wants to check if the tax has been paid by the right person.


That's the beauty of Bitcoin. Not necessary. I could sell my computer in exchange for a transaction that you make to an address for which I don't know the private key and the party that does is 100% impossible to identify until they prove their control over the private key by using it. In other words: The person that gets paid is 100% anonymous, unless you want to define the transaction itself and not the bitcoins as payment. But choose either one, not both.
This is also possible in traditional transactions (where I ask you to put money in a po box which isn't registered to me and the owner of the money can only be identifies when he picks it up, but then there's plausible deniability)
Imagine an economy where *every* transaction is constructed like this. It won't be practical to apply old laws, realisitically it's better to change them to put the burden of paying taxes on the person that can more easily be identified.
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:02:01
I don't know how blockchain makes this estimate. My guess would be to look at the inputs and if multiple origin addresses are aggregated to send a single transaction with a bit remaining, which is smaller than one of the origin addresses, you can assume that the wallet software was using those origin addresses to gather the larger sum for the transaction.
Likewise, you can check both receiving addresses and if one address already received multiple transactions and the other one doesn't, the first is more likely to be the destination.
ps. I looked over my reply to Springmute and you can ignore that. I misunderstood his reply... it has nothing to do with transaction fees. He is right. There is no way to exactly know the amount paid to the recipient, but like I explained in this reply... it can be guessed based on the way most wallets work these days.

It's how the world works. People tend to sacrifice freedom in order to get security. Everybody has a different balanced approach in that, which probably even changes during a life-time (for some day-by-day)
In the end BTC just has the benefits of any distributed system.
Sometimes (currently) that's a cheaper way of doing transactions, without physical storage or monopoly - Sometimes it's less efficient than centralized systems.
BTC and banks will have to find a new balance between distributed and centralized currency which I think is better for everybody.

I think you missed my point. Volatility is relative... in some cases of fiat money you need to hold the currency for 3 days in order to use it. The value could go up or down 1% in that time. For bitcoin you only need to hold it 10 minutes. The value could go up or down the same percentage. For the user it wouldn't matter. Both cases is 1%.
Because bitcoin has less friction, you don't need to hold it for very long and thus with the right infrastructure has equal or more value as other currencies.

If MtGox has a record of another IP-address creating the transaction on their site. They might be able to give that to the police report.

Bitcoin is a blockchain of contracts (transactions) that are guaranteed by math and by nothing else. You can consider it your posession, but there is no guarantee by a company or government and if you lose it, nobody is going to compensate you for it.
So you could call it cash with wings, because in practice, within reasonable probability, that's how you can use it. But realize that you're not actually receiving goods, you are receiving the service of somebody making a transaction to an unregistered PO box that you think can only be accessed by you.

I agree that he doesn't define the law, but he was right. 
The point is that having no identity tied to an address also gives everybody the same right to use it if they can.
Bitcoin addresses are not lockers. They are publicly available in the blockchain for everybody to make a transaction if they can. The rules are defined by the miners who process those transactions.
When you are "putting your trust in math" it works both ways.

Banks are there to store and protect your money and other physical posessions that you don't need right away. They charge a fee for it. A usefull and honest service.

Don't pay your drugs dealer with bitcoins. The money can be traced back to your wallet. If you have any links to an exchange tied with your identity, law enforcement would treat it like paying with your bank-account. So use cash for drugs.
As for the sandwhich, I agree .. it's difficult for consumers right now. It wasn't always like this. Bitcoin has known many periods where you had months of little volatility. After this mania, it will probably go back to a calm period.
You could also use a system where you don't hold bitcoins, but use a service that deducts bitcoins from your bank account when you need it and pay directly to the merchant.

Be careful of playing the "no governement" card too much. In the end, the Bitcoin protocol is controlled by the majority of its users. The miners here have an even more powerful position. If miners group together, they can  control the changes that are (in their view) in the best interest for the network. This is still a governing body. Their are just less defined rules to their politics and the consequences of their decisions are tied more directly to their investment.

I think OP has a legitimate point. He sees bitcoins (or rather the smallest possible unit in the payment network) as something of utility. If there are 2,1 quadrillion of them we will have more than enough to use as a unit of account. Only when these units become scarce, they will have value according to OP. And this is true is you look at Bitcoin through the eyes of somebody who wants to implement colored coins. However, the relative amount of bitcoins among the owners are also used as a measure of wealth and that is where his analogy fails.

That would take more than 'just change the code' - you're right that many users just blindly download the latest QT client, but I'm pretty sure the majority of the users today would still object... and forks would start appearing. 
At first you may think it seems attractive for the miners, but the people controlling the large amounts of bitcoins would be smart enough to sell them. That causes the price to go down and miners would earns less. I don't think they would risk it unless governments over the world unite and force them.

I think it's pretty much impossible for any type of law enforcement to take these claims seriously because of the amount of work that will go into finding out what happened.

It depends how you got that income.
Because ownership of Bitcoin is not registered, the only proof of ownership is when you personally make a transaction in exchange for money, goods or services. Which makes the transaction the only true value here. Not even proving that you know the private key makes you the official owner, because two people could know that key.
Basically having bitcoin in an address is like having valuable information in a public hiding place. Anybody with the key can come in and grab it, but nobody officially owns it. Does knowledge of the key make you an owner? 
I'd say that once the transaction is made, you can see who had the final 'right' to spend it. So instead of taxing the 'ownership' of bitcoins, I think it's more fair to look at taxing the exchange value of a valid transaction.
If you have traded value against a Bitcoin-transaction, then **you can tax the value of that transaction as income for the person who created it** and you can measure that on exchanges.
I realise that it seems completely the opposite of what we are used to. But I think it's the only fair look at the transfer of value in Bitcoin.

These days you can also be identified by textual analysis. So if you start debating with people, writing lengthy manuscripts or code, it is possible so trace it to an account you used on your home computer.
And if your anonymous identity reads or writes information in two or more languages it already narrows down the search a lot.
Just drilling your harddrive won't be enough. With forensic analysis it's still possible to retrieve the magnetic information. When you are using an SSD there are different things you need to pay attention to.

Have been using Bitcoin Wallet for months now. I somehow thought Blockchain only had an app on the iPhone.
Besides, I used to think that the Blockchain Wallet app was only a web-interface around a cloud-wallet, whereas the Bitcoin Wallet actually stores the private keys on your device, but it seems like both apps store the keys and create transactions on the local device.
I've seen the source-code for Bitcoin Wallet and trust that for now. However, after looking at the Blockchain Wallet app, it seems to have some features I was missing from Bitcoin Wallet. I'll have a look at the Blockchain Wallet app source-code later and might decide to switch. Does it support NFC transfers?

I will not compare it with Tulip-mania, because in my view the Bitcoin network has more intrinsic value the bigger it gets. As far as a decentralised functioning network goes, I think the DotCom bubble might be better comparison:
Crypto-currencies have high value. It's a type of money / currency that the world has never had before on this scale and will hopefully add to our societ. Bitcoin has the head start, but it still needs to prove itself.
Edit: If the economy continues as it does, in two years there might be no dollar to price it in.

With CoinJoin you can use other people to exchange coins with each other without using a trusted 3rd party and there is no more trace to the origin of your original coins except if on of the other parties in your CoinJoin exchange personally kept track of the addresses they sent their bitcoins to.

Bitcoin and others haven't had their true test yet.

So there you have it. No rights to a unique number. 
Copying is allowed. If you copy it, that automatically makes you another owner.
The rights to a partical use of a digital asset refers to intellectual property and yes, that's the only way I can see Bitcoin being protected if it's enforced in the whole world.
And I'm not trying to justify stealing at all. I'm saying 'stealing' effectively doesn't exist in the Bitcoin system and therefore people should be prepared for that. Keeping the secret puts the responsibility on you. US courts don't have jurisdiction in the rest of the world. Better to embrace the hard reality instead of trying to put useless energy into fighting something that [wants to be free]( And don't use Bitcoin expecting anything else, when it's clearly not an asset database based on identity.

And yet again the argument of "It's the first, but perhaps a future version will be better". 
That future version would have to create the same network of acceptance in the marketplace, which is extremely dfficult as he pointed out.

People have good reason to be alerted by this. Is was to be expected, but now it's important to pay close attention how this is handled, as it may set a precedent.

People don't like having 'part of something', they want whole items.
I know this has been discussed many times before and yes the Bitcoin system currently identifies 2,1 quadrillion units. However, that's not how people talk about them, nor how exchanges and applications display them. It's almost _always_ denominated in BTC.
And IMHO this is one of the major reasons (if not _the_ reason) why people are now more hesitant to spend a bit of money on this new technology. When you can buy a bunch for $10 or perhaps a few for $100 - it's psychologically easier to comprehend than buying fractions.
I'd even say that unless the entire community switches from BTC to smaller units (ideally just skip the millis and micros and go directly to the satoshi's) and talk about owning '100.000.000' units instead of 1 bitcoin.
Then I think people would love to get their hands on 5.000.000 units for just $5 ... that's a bargain! So they can finally check out this 'Bitcoin' what everybody is talking about.
@_date: 2013-06-09 14:59:54

That's my point. It only has worth when you trade it for real goods or services - shouldn't the laws be built around that concept? So, bitcoin transactions shouldn't be taxed, unless you exchange it for something of value, in which case only the person receiving the goods and/or services is responsible for paying a tax to the government.
I see this as a chance for governments changing their tax policies to something simpler. Don't try to tax the person receiving money, no need to identify the owner of a Bitcoin-address, just tax people receiving goods and services. Sure it's also hard to enforce, but I'm sure it's cheaper and easier than the alternative of trying to identify people receiving bitcoins (which is technically not tied to any identity and available to anybody which knowledge of the private key).

Finding the right block (mining) is a game of chance. It's like guessing the right number between 1 and 100. 
If you could only guess once per second, it would take you on average 50 tries (= 50 seconds)
Sometimes it will take you 100 guesses, but sometimes it will only take you 1 guess.
If you continue that game for a year, it can happen that you guess 7 correct numbers in only 7 seconds. But sometimes it will take you 700 seconds.

I think you are partially correct that it's best to give up any notion of ownership in Bitcoin any time soon - you either have control or you don't... 
Sure, If you have a contract with a company that will keep a private key for you, giving you access to x amount of bitcoins when you ask for them, then they have the legal obligation to give you coins back if you want them.... 
But others than that, unless you have an internationally recognized institution like ICANN where you can register a public key to your identity, I doubt we'll have any type of court-cases where people can claim rights to ownership of certain bitcoins.

Important misconceptions that I hardly see explained:

2) they think *nobody is backing it*, while everybody running the node is backing it  (keeping the network running) and verifying that blockchain. 
3) *mining wastes computer power*, but in fact it secures the network by processing the transactions and adding them as a block to the blockchain. And for that they get a reward.

You are correct on all fronts. Currently it is decentralized, but groups could try to gain total control of the network. When that happens, users are free to switch to software updates that work against centralization and if that doesn't work, they are free to switch to a new less centralized altcoin network.
Every shop can accept crypto-currency they prefer and useful networks beside Bitcoin will keep competing for the market.

I think you'll find countries unwilling to recognize it as such (for now)
With Bitcoin it's near impossible to distinguish something that has been given to you on purpose anonymously or something that was accidentallity given to you. I'd say it's not called stealing, because anybody using Bitcoin should be smart enough to understand this risk.
If you put something in an account with a key that is known to somebody else, expect it to be taken. It's an inherent risk of Bitcoin. It might be immoral, but so is adultery and that is not illegal in all countries either. (Imagine people sending bitcoins to this address: [1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T]( and then complaining that it was stolen. Where do you draw the line?)
Your trust in the system is just totally up to you. If you do it right, the chance for anybody to have the same key is SO incredibly small, that Bitcoin is still useful.

I'm fine with mBTC, uBTC etc.
The general population might start to use it when everything can be calculated in amounts of satoshi.
Once the general public hears that $1 == 1.000.000 satoshi, they might become more interested. It means they get a lot of units for only a single US dollar.
The flip side is that these units will be seen as worthless, so perhaps it will only become really mainstream and accepted when $1 gets you around 100 satoshi.
Masses in foreign countries might be able to accept it sooner when their own currency is already in a different order of magnitude.

The thing is that with p2p systems is that everybody is (or can be) an exchange. Similar to how p2p file sharing systems have functionality for both uploading and downloading, the Bitcoin network allows everybody with a network connection to implement both the storage of coins and relay of transactions.
The regulation seems to clearly make that distinction, this headline doesn't.

He would still be accepting Bitcoin (the transaction network)
My view is that the more Bitcoin is used for transactions between two parties, the more valuable its units become. The easier it is to switch to another cryptocurrency (in terms of equal market acceptance, security and price stability) for the transactions you want, the less valuable Bitcoin becomes.

There is a difference between usage and ownership ofcourse.
If I have unique information on how to measure distances of a specific star between other stars and there is a market where people offer a lot of money to know these distances.
Although unlikely, somebody else might also acquire that method which could be considered my intellectual property. However, whenever somebody pays me for measuring a distance, I don't consider the information of distance between stars as my property. I do consider any dollars I receive in exchange for that as my taxable income.
The difference between fiat currency and physical resources is that private keys are information that can be copied, so it's more like intellectual property.

The exchange rate multiplied by a factor of 10 in 6 months. And my guess it that the trigger happened just after the halving of the block-reward. My guess is that miners were selling them at a steady price until their reserves started running dry and price went up, bringing with it a whole lot of new interest.
Only 2 more of those occurances are needed for it to reach $10.000. Ask this question again in 8 years ok?

Yes, then the type of data should first be protected from law by theft. Otherwise I'd say we're talking about free information and it's the responsibility of the owner to keep it secret. If they fail, there's nothing the law can do about it.
Ofcourse if somebody breaks the law in order to obtain that information, they should be prosecuted for breaking those laws. But not for making a transaction with free information.

I'm starting to feel a general direction that governments around the world want to take Bitcoin. They would be happiest with a scenario where they can isolate Bitcoin as a risky investment and possible store of value, so it's easier for them to regulate within borders. People would be allowed to trade them if governments know exactly who sends which bitcoin to who else. If they allow it to be used as currency, things could get out of hand. So I wouldn't be surprised if BitPay is going to get a cease and desist next year.

Keep in mind that the only reason why Bitcoin follows these rules is because &gt;50% of the network decides to follow these rules. Once the majority decides that more bitcoins are needed, they can be created. But it would need consensus of the majority of the network. And you can be sure that a lot of people would oppose that, so Bitcoin might lose a lot of its value because people could start to use another crypto currency.

Gold already had the reputation it needed.
So I'll rephrase it so you'll understand my previous sentence.
"Only if more people pay for things with Bitcoin, will the currency earn the reputation as something of value, which will lead to a growth in value (like gold)."
By themselves bitcoins are worthless, just a bunch of transactions and addresses. But because the network is usefull and people actually use it, the value of individual coins go up.
Currently the value that people are willing to trade for Bitcoin far outweighs its use. For a large degree based on hope and speculation. Lots of people are hoarding and if the demand doesn't increase (because of it's usefullness), its value will go down eventually. The more people own bitcoins, the more they are willing to use it.... increasing its usefullness.

There IS a lot of room, but you have to look at many more aspects than just growth rate and percentages. Centralized vs distributed networks have both advantages and disadvantages (some shared by the general public and people in power, some opposed) and the Bitcoin network has mutable and immutable characteristics which apply. There will come a point in the near future where the Bitcoin bubble will burst because people over-estimated how quickly the world can adapt to new technology. 
I think Bitcoin (or something similar) has a large future on the long term 20+ years, but on the short term, it is very volatile and a risky investment. Public understanding is too low and any story about hackers or scandals or government intervention will lead to "bank runs". I don't think this will be solved in the next 5 years.

For understanding and using the technology you don't need Satoshi's real name. It's exactly like TCP/IP where the inventor of the protocol has no control over people implementing the software using it nor can he control the data being sent 
And it's also not a ponzi scheme in that respect anymore than Facebook or Twitter is a ponzi scheme. It looks like it, because people try to convince you to join as every extra user creates a more valuable network. But there is nobody at the top promising you guaranteed returns... it's a network of people trying more people to use the same technology.
As for the 1 million bitcoins, yeah you could be a little worried about that. There is already a "1% richest" in Bitcoin and as long as they have their stash, they hold enormous power over the network (similar to stockholders with up to 10% of the stocks)
But also similar to stocks, usually people are interested in having them keep their value. So unless Satoshi cares enough willing to throw away $300.000.000 - I don't think you have a lot to worry about. Although the U.S. government may have something to gain from this so they could flood the market with cheap coins from the FBI Silk Road case.

Oh yes, I agree with that. I'm just saying that it is nice to have competition on the market... that companies actually have to earn those fees. The largest reason why the VISA/Mastercard/PayPal fees are so high is probably because they *can* ... sure they'll complain that insurance, mitigation and complying with regulation is expensive, but they also have no incentive to lower the fees. People can't move to another provider, because that's pretty much all there is.
Personally, whenever I pay with Bitcoin... I just buy them and spend thim all within 5 minutes. I would much rather do that, than use any of the companies mentioned above. If only because I don't always have to send my person details to the receiver. Like anonymous donations, reading articles, buying games, etc.

Perhaps a good idea to make it clear that the person requesting a transaction in exchange for good or services isn't necessarily in control of the new address. 
Every transaction is setup with a construction where you can identify 3 people: 
1. the person requesting a transaction
2. the person creating a transaction
3. the person(s) controlling the new address
Nowhere in this process does the person requesting the transaction also control the bitcoins. Only when you identify the person(s) in control of the new address, can you identify who benefits. 
It would be nice to know which legal requirements and tax laws there are for the person making the request. 
Edit: you can maybe identify a 4th person (the miner) in this transaction process if you take confirmations into account

So you think that he is skeptical about a certain type of future for Bitcoin. 
Why doesn't he just say that? 
Being skeptical about Bitcoin itself would imply that you don't trust it works as people think it does. 
I do see reasons to be careful about the future, but I'm not skeptical about Bitcoin, because it has already proven to work. It's working now, with tens of thousands of transactions per day.

I agree. 
Bitcoin is not political, but a medium of exchange that was missing in this age of information. 
It's entirely possible for government to regulate it using the same rules they use for tracking cash purchases. If you live a luxurious life that doesn't match your registered income and assets they will crack down and you will have the burden of proof.

Yes they can become very popular. And honestly, I really like Ripple for their alternative approach. However, the point is that the currency distribution from Ripple is just as centralized as the FED printing new dollars. 
Their payment network is more distributed than the current banking system. The question is how long Bitcoin miners and Ripple nodes can resist regulation of transaction validation. Where there are currently dozens of competitive crypto-currencies. Setting up a payment network competing with Ripple seems much harder because it requires a lot more trust. 
Therefor I think Bitcoin and its sibling altcoins are rightfully the honey badgers of the world economies and payment networks.

Forgive me for any limited understanding, but from that I've read sofar:
Some miners lost their block-rewards and if BTC becomes even more valuable, they could not be so willing to continue on an old version.
If Bitcoin ever becomes big enough that miners can go bankrupt by giving up their blocks, I see a future where these forks by bugs in different Bitcoin-versions will be seen as reason for miners to choose the blockchain which is in their best interest.
One step futher if Bitcoin becomes large enough for countries to feel the effect, it could be that countries will have to make political decisions on which blockchain to support. Resulting in a different blockchain networks for each country... and perhaps even the basis of future wars.

It does seem like Bart Chilton was well aware that it's a global currency, so he probably thinks it can be regulated the same way gold trading is regulated. However, with gold you can stop and confiscate it at the border. Bitcoin is pure information and can't be traced to a specific location not confiscated unless you spy on people all the time.

@_date: 2013-12-18 22:01:21
At its core, it's just a transaction system. Bitcoins only have value as much as there is demand for them to be used in the system (like with IP addresses or domain names) The more transactions people want to make with them, the higher the demand. If people want to buy and hold, it doesn't bring much to the value of the network yet the units become scarce for no reason other than to hold. You can do that with any altcoin. Bitcoins have value because they are **useful** and **scarce**... not *just* because they are **scarce**.
Once certain people start backing specific coins with gold or stocks.. then it becomes more interesting to hold them.
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:00:13
Why Bitcoin? Why not a new currency started by the U.N. so that everybody has a fair chance to start mining at the start with the resources they have. You know, so that people who are already wealthy have the opportunity and a fair shot to dominate the system from the beginning instead of being left behind as they were now with BTC. /sarcasm

@_date: 2013-10-15 11:34:56


As soon as you're seen as a threat to decentralisation, the value of Bitcoin will go down because people lose their trust in the system.
For example: Mining Pool BTC Guild started approaching the 50% hashrate, but [promised to take measures before it ever came to that]( because it was undermining the trust in Bitcoin (no pun intended)
The insentive for every large player is to keep decentralization up to the level that the (trust) value of BTC stays high, because if they don't, they will feel it in their wallets as soon as people start to notice.
So unless miners can somehow hide their pool-size, they will actively scale back when their size becomes a threat. They maintain profits by charging higher fees (or perhaps only process transactions with higher fees?)
If the latter becomes a trend, Bitcoin-transactions could become quite a bit more expensive in the future.
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:43:03
I too often see the mistake made that Bitcoin has only 21 million units. This is incorrect. There will be 21 million bitcoins, but each bitcoin is (currently) divisible up to 100.000.000 units (satoshi).
So basically the current Bitcoin system enivisions 2.100.000.000.000.000 units.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:42:47
What is the intrinsic value of a domain name? or an IP address range? Yet companies pay millions for them.... Something is as valuable as its usability and scarcity. 
Edit: Although I must admit, people were paying much more for domain-names than they would ever be worth. The difference with Bitcoin is that they are either all worth the current price, or they all overvalued.

I doubt it. Initial reaction would be to create a new fiat currency, probably backed by something of value that the U.S. Government has plenty of but others don't. I'd say gold, but I'm not sure because it's unclear how much the U.S. actually has.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:53:37
Still. If Bitcoin ever becomes a dominant currency, you can expect governments to regulate merchants to register their Bitcoin-address. 
As soon as the money moves, with the right software police will be able to trace every single coin and as soon as it's spent at registered merchants they will be able to trace it to the customer. From that customer, they can trace back who they were dealing with.
There are mixing services and gambling sites could make it even harder.

Be careful. You can't give proof of ownership, only proof of access to the private key. There is no legal basis to claim an address. And unless governments validate Bitcoin and embrace it with regulation, there never will be. Remember, this is an international effort.

There is no stopping the idea of Bitcoin. The only thing governments can do is try to postpone it by making it illegal for a while. That will last until some very influential people have something to gain from allowing Bitcoin.
You said it yourself. Bitcoin is a system that gains value the less manipulated it is. People who try to manipulate it, can be caught by studying the blockchain and when that happens it will be worth less and people flow into alternativeS. For now it seems to be in the users' best interest to preserve Bitcoin as a transparent system.

Yes, but many people would use this over PayPal or MasterCard/VISA simply by principle or because they can't get accounts there. And it would take the volatility for a large part out of the equation.

I am curious what happens to the mining power when price per Bitcoin crashes down 80% like it has in the past. How many miners would immediately stop mining because it stops being profitable?

As long as prices of Bitcoin are going up without know the true value or potential (usually found after multiple human generations of having stability) you might as well say that it's a bubble. 
The network does have intrinsic value because of several properties that normal money and currency don't have. But whether that's enough to justify it's current prices. Nobody knows for sure.. just like nobody know whether the sun will be coming up tomorrow.

Unregulated doesn't mean unsupported. We the users like to have a foundation acting in our interest. If they fuck up we complain or setup a competing body to act in our interest. Bitcoin itself is anarchy but that doesn't mean that we the people shouldn't come together and form interest  groups.

I'm sure that the same headline is going to be used for Bitcoin somewhere within the next couple of years.

I don't think so.. You'll need either VPN or a type of alternative p2p internet app. Too difficult for too many people and any new system that becomes popular could be blocked again. 
It's not possible to shutdown Bitcoin, but it's possible to make it too difficult for too many users.

It is high time for [Open-Transactions]( exchanges to start appearing. That will still keep the people accountable for receiving the money over traditional banking accounts, but people won't lose their money when the exchange is shut down.

Remember that in the time that Satoshi set this up, he didn't expect to get rich off this. There was hardly any mention that Bitcoin could be traded for other currencies. People just played around with it and though of it as an experiment and small-time transactions. It wasn't until the successful sale of the Bitcoin-pizza that people started realizing that it might become bigger.
Exactly _because_ he is so smart, he won't spend it. If he ever does, it might be out of ideological reasons or perhaps out of desperation. But somebody with such talents and doesn't just do it for wealth. He doesn't need it.


Yes, all the btc suspected he controls is heavily scrutinized. If only a single transaction is made, large efforts will be done to find out to whom and what for. Even mixers don't completely anonimize the money-trail... and in future efforts will be easier to trace. e.g. [Taint-analysis]( - Bitcoin is the opposite of untracable and once you identify certain people in the trail, you can quickly find others.

Best one I read in the past few days is this one from [National Geographic]( (except for the terrible drawing)

Going from zero to 1 is an infinitly higher growth rate yes. They can be exchanged for BTC, which mean they are used as payment. This is hope, piggybacking on BTC. They are actually taking value *away* on the short term. Bitcoin is leading the way and if it doesn't get a higher adoption rate, this fragmentation, which comes with an infinite amount of competitors, will make all crypto-currencies worth less. The ones that keep their value and grow will be those which are used for payments on the long term.

I love how your reply can exist in the super position of both sarcasm and praise at the same time.

Yes, but I think he made a mistake with fungibility. 
One bitcoin is not the same as the other, because of it's history in the blockchain. Taint.
I would say it's a tie on that topic.

It's an attitude problem. Conservative people usually act out fear of things they don't understand. Progressive people act out of hope of something better. Being conservative is healthy in many aspects, but when you dismiss something because you don't understand something, you're just displaying incompetence.
Granted Bitcoin has a long way to go to be trusted with large amounts of your savings, but many economists and so called experts have made fools out of themselves and showed the world how overvalued they themselves are.
*"Economists and journalists often get caught up in this question: Why does Bitcoin have value? And the answer is very easy. Because it it useful and scarce. I think these people should be asking the more important question: Why do THEY have value?"* - Erik Voorhees
