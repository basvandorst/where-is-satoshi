Lot of tether sell orders that were placed ages ago with no expectation they'd be reached

But if most transactions happen off chain, the fees won't continue to rise. They're only as high as they are because everything is on chain.

Same. The technical incompetence of poloniex is bordering on criminal.

The point of bitcoin is trustlessness. Centralization isn't the bogeyman some think it is. It's the control that centralization brings that's the problem. Trustlessness removes that control.
All that is besides the point though. There is no centralization with the LN.

They're still butthurt over facebook so they're looking for self-validation by being bitcoin kings. They're never gonna sell.

If you really think Coinbase is anywhere comparable to Mt.Gox then I don't know what to tell you.

You should be able to get into his coinbase account by contacting support about that account. They will surely require proof of death and proof of family relationship. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:12:27
At least they bought the dip
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:55:08
You're more likely to get hacked and lose your coins than coinbase is to get hacked and not have funds to honor your balance. Unless you have serious amounts or you're serious about bitcoin, just leave it on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:07:37
The question is who is more likely to lose his money at this stage in the game? A newbie to crypto or coinbase? Coinbase is simply more secure hands down.

There's gonna be a whole lot of suicidal druggies soon. Then again, it's a good ice breaker to say you literally snorted $10MM in coke.

I'll buy the next round

Their support is and will always be total shit. Don't hold them on their site if you may need them at specific times.

It is a ponzi until some point when bitcoin can replace VISA, and that will take many technological advancements.

Awareness grows exponentially.

If there were multiple independent implementations then effort should have been done to ensure compatibility. If this was the only implementation then being off by one is irrelevant. But these are two separate issues (being off by one vs being compatible).

I'm guessing you left out the part where mining uses more electricity than some small countries.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:14:31
Ethereum has had a good steady dollar price for a while now regardless of bitcoin swings. It's also interesting tech in its own right and so a good buy for diversification. But a real black swan event with bitcoin will bring all the alts down with it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:13:22
When there's blood on the charts, buy bitcoin.

If there's no one you trust use a deadman's email. Keep the encrypted seed in a safe and/or emailed to family, then have the password emailed upon death.

The off-by-one error here is superficial. 2x nodes are waiting for a 2mb block at 494783 instead. Big whoop.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:24:33
This was an own-goal by BCH. Full blocks means higher fees which means more profit for miners. If there currently is profit parity between BCH and BTC, the better bet for miners is to ensure BTC wins out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:50:45
This seems to be a trade off between node centralization and transaction centralization. If scaling solutions happen through third party sites then you're in a situation where the paypals and the VISAs (or whatever their equivalents will be) can still control the flow of money. Is this a better state of affairs then fewer full nodes? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:08
Coinbase always "crashes" during wild swings like this. It's probably programmed downtime to avoid being forced into losing positions.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:07:37
There are literally dozens of these already.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:10:16
Mainstream awareness is picking up and people with rich pockets and financial institutions are starting to take notice. It's far from certain the price will keep going up, but its looking pretty good.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:48:20
Forks are a feature of blockchain, not a bug. If the big players decide to fork such that every exchange calls their fork "bitcoin", well that's the nature of a decentralized system. 
Now, I'm against useless forks and uncertainty as much as anyone else. But I'm also against pointless drama. The first fork in August should have been both segwit with blocksize increase. It's the lack of compromise that drove us to the cliff. I do not blame those with their own financial interests on the line for attempting to move us out of the stalemate.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:42:35
Start worrying at 10 days. 6 days isn't enough time for coinbase. Coinbase is one of the more reliable USD to bitcoin exchanges. Your money is safe.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:07:50
They're called parents. If you don't know enough about bitcoin and why its valuable to convince them (after a 10x increase in the last year), you probably shouldn't invest anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:15:25
Crypto is winner-take-most. There will be one main currency, and a handful of much smaller market cap utility coins. The game is to figure out which ones have staying power.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:24:13
Agreed. It almost guarantees the hardfork fails because any trust in them was killed by making such an elementary error.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:06:05
The vertical scale grows exponentially (the gap between 0 and 1, 1 and 10, 10 and 100 are the same length), and so it allows you to comprehend the long term growth pattern better. That is, seeing linear growth on an exponential chart exemplifies the underlying exponential growth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:35:35


Why not? It's not obvious why it *shouldn't* be on chain. I get that it doesn't *have to* be. But why shouldn't it be?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:33:54
I see a 100k difference. Not significant.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:50:26
Do you realize the actual block the fork occurs at is irrelevant?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:51:12
You guys really need to stop worshiping at the alter of Satoshi. Bitcoin has and will continue to grow beyond what he envisioned. This is a good thing. Chaining yourself to a 10 year old vision (a lifetime in terms of technical progress) is a serious error.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:31
Very good point, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:56:49
This is dumb. If the core bitcoin devs had gone forward with the fork, they wouldn't have made such an amateur mistake. There was no risk to the network. Trying to punish big players for attempting to move bitcoin out of the stalemate is also dumb. They're a part of the ecosystem just as much as anyone else. Such decisions are a fact of a decentralized community.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:09:12
If 2x was going to happen officially the real bitcoin devs wouldn't have made such an amateurish mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:26:33
Good point. Yeah that is bad.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:05:46
I really don't know how people make that kind of mistake. Maybe I'm overly paranoid by nature but I triple/quadruple check the address for even the smallest transactions. I'll even try and phonetically sound out part of the address as a last ditch sanity check.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:03:45
Right, but why does this need to be done by every new full node perpetually into the indefinite future? The current consensus is indicative of the correctness of the past beyond some point (i.e. the probability of an unnoticed mistake decreases the older the transaction is). The only issue I see is that you may be seeded with a malicious database. But I can imagine a distributed signing schemes that can mitigate this threat.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:11:55
Why does everyone need to validate the entire thing, even ancient history? Why not prune the transactions past a certain age?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:34:45
Have you tried an ACH transfer and waiting for it to clear? When you buy through credit or debit, there is a risk of a chargeback and with crypto its extremely high.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:25:21
You don't want uncertainty in bitcoin when ETH is ready to swoop in. Bitcoin should be playing defense and yet all I see are people who don't even realize they're in a war.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:02:12
There are little to no parallels between the ETH split and a potential bitcoin split. The main critical difference is that there was nothing nipping at Ethereums heels waiting to take its place. So when the chain split and the value tanked, there wasn't even the potential for any "flippening" event. The same cannot be said for bitcoin. Any uncertainty can cause a run on capital, and a movement into ethereum and other alts. Who is to say it would ever recover?
