People do that. It's fraud. It hits you hard with chexsystems and will make it hard to get an account at a financial institution in the future.

If exchanges alone had lightning channels with each other that would be huge.

So you would encourage exchanges to use it?

Once lightning comes, if only the exchanges used it among themselves the load lightened would be insane, not to mention if normal users used it.

Probably none if you don't plan on moving them for a few years. Transaction fee would be slightly higher if there happens to be congestion at the time but if you're a hodler the fee should be negligible for ya.

I think mobile wallets like mycelium, coinami would help a lot. I've switched to samourai for most of my needs though.

Ok thanks, that makes sense. That's why I said "once lightning comes" in my original comment. I meant once the lightning network is out of beta.
