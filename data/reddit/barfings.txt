@_date: 2018-01-01 07:26:49
That doesn’t make any sense because it’s still a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. (It’s a shitcoin)
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:26:41
Don’t use Coinbase/GDAX. Very bad service. Customer support is garbage. Use Gemini instead! I’ve used both in the past and highly recommend Gemini!
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:26:08
Do you live with rednecks or something ?

Great vid, for the buy stop why would you want to purchase at a higher price when you can purchase at what it was then? To ensure that the market is going up?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:29:15
It only takes a week max. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:23:18
Only use Gemini. No BS and large sums of money are 100% safe. Coinbase/GDAX is garbage. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:25
Looks like if found a BCash fan here 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:00:35
Roger will stop when he is out of money. He is spending a large amount of money marketing for his scamcoin along with spamming the bitcoin mempool. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:42:15
We’re at the first sell of rn. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:15:13
As of right now, the mempool is clogged up. Once it clears up, transaction times will be back to regular along with the prices of fees. 
When Lightning Network comes in 2018, transaction times will be literally instant and the fees will be very minimal. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:01:28
How much of a fee did you pay? As of right now, the mempool is clogged up. Once it clears up, transaction times will be back to regular along with the prices of fees. 
When Lightning Network comes in 2018, transaction times will be literally instant and the fees will be very minimal. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:23
Why did you sell lol. It’s going to go back up again in a couple of days
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:23:43
It’ll be useless because everyone will be using bitcoin for micro transactions and macro transactions when Lightning Network comes. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:28:18
What a sad day
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:58:34

For sure
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:05:01
Sign up for Gemini. Much better than Coinbase. Nothing shady either. Excellent service too!

Nice, how did you time the dips?

do no panic sell! even if the price goes down by 30%, it will bounce back up even higher than before. just hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:08
If my wallet is SegWit and I send a transaction to an exchange that does not support SegWit, will my transaction go through and be processed?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:02:42
Very true. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:39:28
If the price goes down slightly, people will buy it up at the dips because they are looking for an entry point. Actually a good thing institutional investors are coming. Very healthy long-term for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:47:00
Earlier today, someone sent a large amount of BTC to a BCH address. That person email this popular guy on YouTube and Twitter named Tone Vays regarding this issue. Tone Vays is an excellent technical analyst of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and regular stocks on YouTube. 99% or his price predictions have been spot on since 2013. I highly recommend everyone here to watch his videos on YouTube!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:14
Coinbase is garbage. Gemini is much better. The support team at Gemini is very quick on responding. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:10:26
Do not sign up for Coinbase/GDAX. I repeat, do NOT sign up for Coinbase/GDAX. Horrible service. Support team is garbage. Instead, a great alternative is Gemini. I have used both exchanges in the past, and Gemini is unprecedented in the quality of their service and ease of purchasing bitcoin. Very easy and quick to get signed up. Nothing shady either unlike Coinbase/GDAX! Hope this helps.

BCash is a scam. Litecoin is better. But when Lightning Network comes for bitcoin, all Altcoins will go in the toilet. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:00:02
Gemini is the best exchange. Much better service than Coinbase/GDAX. Nothing shady either! Highly recommend Gemini!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:04:21
What’s the reason though?
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:03:20
I love this story. Keep up your great work in crypto and one day you will look back and thank yourself!
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:37:12
Use Gemini. It’s much better than Coinbase/GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:02:30
Gemini is 100x better than Coinbase. I have used both in the past and Gemini’s service is superior. Highly recommend Gemini. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:05
Don’t use Coinbase. Use Gemini. Much lower fees and much better service. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:41:27
One reason is Roger Ver with his shitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:45:08
It took a couple of days. Some people have been waiting for about a week, but that’s rare. Keep in mind that many people are signing up to purchase crypto everyday and especially Gemini since people are leaving Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:01:39
It’s legit
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:29:43
yay thanks for the update

Let’s report it to the SEC or something

Never keep your coins on an exchange. Move it to a hardware wallet such as Ledger Nano S or Trezor.

Which for? There are forks happening left and right. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:06:01

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:39:41
Yes they will go down. As of right now, the network is clogged up with many transactions. They will all be processed and fees will be back to normal soon.

@_date: 2017-12-25 06:57:06
Make one that says BTrash lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:51
No, the only reason why transactions are taking so long this week is because of the mempool spam. Mostly Attacks orchestrated by Roger Ver. Once the mempool clears up, transaction times and fees will be back to normal!
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:19:45
DO NOT buy from Coinbase/GDAX. Only buy from Gemini. 
Gemini is much better, has great service, and the support team is amazing. Exact opposite of Coinbase/GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:58
If everyone integrates SegWit, there will literally be no unconfirmed transactions and the transaction fees will be less than a couple of dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:43:45
Roger Ver and his sock puppets spamming the bitcoin mempool once again. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:02

@_date: 2017-12-25 04:38:45
Are you the one that emailed Tone?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:25
Gemini for sure. Amazing service. I highly recommend them. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:40:58
Yup, it’s a scam. Never use Bitcoin.com. It’s a shitcoin promoter now. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:22
Gemini for sure. Amazing service and amazing support team. Nothing ever shady like Coinbase. Fees on Gemini are MUCH less than Coinbase. I have used both in the past and highly recommend Gemini over Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:27:05
But also the new year would introduce other institutional investors since their budget is renewed.  There will most likely be a dramatic rise in the price, if anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:40:25
Personally, I wouldn’t use Coinbase. Horrible service. Use Gemini instead. Fees are much lower. First you would sign up, then deposit money (you can do ACH transfers or wire deposits) then buy bitcoin. Then transfer bitcoin to your hardware wallet’s address!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:01
Holy shit.. that was amazing. So fast. So easy. Can’t wait for the Lightning Network to come!  All of these Altcoins will disappear and there will only be one true coin. Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:15
It can never go to zero because then anyone can mine it with a regular laptop or computer
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:21:33
Gemini is the best exchange. Much better than Coinbase/GDAX. Gemini provides great service and excellent customer support. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:00
Done ✅ 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:28:06

@_date: 2017-12-26 06:05:27
Exactly. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:11:42
Damn, I sent a $100 transaction the other day to an exchange and it still took over a day to get there. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:40:46
I’m not quite sure on the day it will be released. But the test net is up and running if you want to test it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:41:33

LMAO I LOVE THIS. I wish this was so true ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:47:15
Congrats! And no, it never takes this long. The mempool is just heavily backed up at this time. Always takes me 10-15 min to receive my bitcoin with an average to low fee!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:11
What was the fee you paid?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:49:19
Coinbase is garbage. Signup for Gemini. Much better service. 1/6 of the fees. No bs either, unlike Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:40:34
have segwit
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:29:46
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:56:00
get a Ledger Nano S. It has SegWit for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:38:57
the black one in small, please !
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:35:29
how do i get one?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:15:49
oh, because people will sell it for BTC
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:05:31
how would i receive it?
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:06:23
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:26:57
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:49:07
get ready for the crash ��
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:40:07
haha thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:56:33
what's happening August 8th?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:45:57
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:22:22
does that mean Bitcoin may go up or down by a lot?
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:02:33
To Grab Attention For The Post ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:54:36
so it's safe to be kept in there for Aug 1st?
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:14:42
is it possible to get the Ledger Nano S to change the address every time Bitcoins were sent to it?
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:16:08
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:02:34
nigga wtf 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:33:28
thank you for the info! has changed my perspective on purchasing Bitcoins since i'm hodling long term
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:16:06
don't listen to them ^ BCC is trash. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:25:16
Coinbase steals your Bitcoins while Gemini doesn't. 
(coinbase randomly closes accounts with no reason and you can't get them back)
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:57:27
around what time do you think that will happen tho
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:34:14
Get a Ledger instead. It is much better. the support team, the interface, and it's much easier to use. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:33:35
wouldn't the price of Bitcoin go down tho?
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:24:12
you have it on a ledger or trezor or paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:18:39
Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:51:20
nigga wtf 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:50:35
What kind of side action are we talking about?
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:40:11
not traceable to use ZCash?
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:32:11
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:01:18
how come?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:46:03
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:30:13
how come ZEC?
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:23:43
expect a correction soon !
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:37:38
know what caused the outages?

@_date: 2017-08-14 21:52:01
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:11:43
so i would say i got 'hacked' and it's easy as that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:32
It’s okay, I’ve made this same mistake too. I did NOT sell before when it corrected. In a few days, we will hit a new ATH. So just hodl!
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:58:53
okay thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:19:56
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:02:29

@_date: 2019-12-26 14:22:43
There are none
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:34:16
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:09:57
Phenomenal. Can’t wait to see what this upcoming year has for us!
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:34:01
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:07:40
How would selling you bitcoin at that price help you win the bet? The bet was “bitcoin would end the year below $6800.” Not who can purchase bitcoin below $6900...
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:38:24
That would be a BIG oof
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:37:15
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:44:07
He explains it thoroughly in his videos about bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:11:37
In the next few years hopefully we can get a real one!
@_date: 2019-12-27 00:02:22
I wish. But that defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:06:21
Watch some of Andreas Antonopolous’s vids on YouTube. They’re phenomenal
@_date: 2019-12-20 04:24:31
eh heh
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:21:17
If they’re tying to censor cryptocurrencies, they’re clearly doing it wrong. This ban wave and mass vid removal just gives bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more press and coverage because it makes people research why this is happening. Then they’ll realize the true power of cryptos.
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:02:55
No, I’m hodling long term
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:31:50
what's your source 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:21:35
Can’t wait for LN to go mainstream! :)
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:35:40
Doesn’t a channel open up automatically when you generate a LN wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:04:58
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:59:22
NO don't go there! they close accounts randomly and take the Bitcoins! Be warned! 
use something else. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:51:37
so basically new coins emerge from being an ICO? Everyone always says that ICO’s are scams. How do we know if one is a scam and the other is not?
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:37:09
okay thanks

@_date: 2017-07-30 18:35:04
bitcoin will crash below $1000 on August first. Beware. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:59:56
so are you saying that the price of Bitcoin will drop prior to August 1st? or the day of?
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:18:10
you think it would go lower than 1800? if so, what are your projections?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:01:11
:) you don't know who you're talking to buddy ;)
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:19:08
search my question on reddit?
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:58:58
was seeing what other redditors were thinking. :-D
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:44:16
yeah your mom's rock
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:04:20
there is an address when i click "receive" in the Ledger Bitcoin application on Chrome. Should i just copy &amp; paste that into Gemini where it requires an address to withdraw from the exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:07:29
okay thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:44:01
does that mean the price of Bitcoin will go down before Aug 1st or no? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:24:32
all of the above ����
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:49:34
what's gox 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:19:00
what forks are, what segwit is, what BCC and these new ones are. and what to do to be prepared for aug 1st. 
i see these questions being asked a lot on here..
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:54:21
oh mt. gox.  duh. my bad
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:34:30
transfer it to a hard wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:35:31
and is that all i need to do to have full control over my private keys?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:39:48
just trying to get your guy's opinions...
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:52:24
How long until it is safe to move around Bitcoins after Aug. 1st?
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:13:51
how long ago did you purchase it?
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:02:19
thank you !! :)
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:02:28
got it, thanks!
