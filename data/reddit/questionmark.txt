Hash rate will probably drop at that point.

First rewards were 50 coins a block, every 4 years (roughly) it halves, until there's nothing left to mine.
Bulk of the coins are already out there thanks to this system.

If everyone Hodl then there won't be any transaction fees to mine.

Gonna be hard to research how to do this without power/internet for all the people who aren't aware of it already. (which is pretty much everyone)

It didn't lower the barrier to entry..  You still need to either setup a miner (tough if you are just starting out) or buy them on an exchange (confusing for people just starting out).
 I've been mining over a year and I'm still puzzled at times about the ghost problems of mining rigs and the wild west nature of exchanges.

The good news is while you can't withdraw, they will start offering BFL equipment for sale to make it up to you.

I don't need tips, I need serious money.  Thanks for the 1/64th of a cent in Dogecoin, it was nice, but perhaps next time you could give a actual tip (meaning, information) that could lead me to some financial success?

More important, did you ever get a ticket?

The block reward has been cut in half twice, but it's still significant based on the current price of a Bitcoin.
If the value had stayed at around $250 per bitcoin, I doubt we'd see so many miners out there still.
If the price continues to rise, then the miners will stick around.

Bitcoin peaked at about $1,200 back then on Mt. Gox, then fell into the mid-hundreds for a few years before finally starting it's long (short) climb to where we are now basically this calendar year.

God the fees to send bitcoin around when the price is $1 million will pretty much make it useless.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:05:46
?  Bitcoin never hit anything close to that in 2013.

Let’s be honest here,   This increase is too much too fast...  we’re due for a correction at some point.

I saw this at a Coinstar in NH a week or 2 ago.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:35:37
Hint: let me know when it does, because as of today, we would be ~~fucked~~ really angry if the price went to $1 million.
/edit I say angry because I'd still be rich, but it would hurt to lose thousands every time I need to transfer my coins around.

Even if the wallet has never been used ever to store bitcoin?  I keep my actual coins on another wallet that is not used as a full node.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:23:32
Yea, I figured as much, but my question was more about leaving a user running in the background as another user was active in the foreground. (People that use OS X user switching should hopefully understand what I mean).
I have a full node running at home that's up to date... is there a way I can just copy that data over onto a 256GB thumb drive and bring it into work to jumpstart the process?  The wallet at home is empty.  If so what files/folders do I need to copy?
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:14:09
So it's ok to have my machines on a single payment address on p2pool.  It's not like other pools where you need separate workers on the same account for each machine.  I'm not a crunching powerhouse, but all of them combined output about 150khash (litecoins) which is decent.  (atleast that's what the p2pool node stats say for my address.  
 I have a old slower machine that has it's own wallet on it that I was mining on p2pool for a few days.  It has very few litecoins on it.  like .5 or less.  How can I transfer those off?  It won't let me because I don't have enough for the transfer fees....

I had read that while it's a pain to get money out of Gox to a US account, that other countries were not nearly as tied up.  That's why I ask if starting an account in another country could make things easier.  I don't know if it's easy to get money from Gox to the UK, or to a Swiss account.  Cayman islands?  Again, I'm not knowledgeable with international banking.  
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:21:47


This is a big issue I wasn't aware of.   Are there any countries with..... looser standards that make it possible to set up a account and transfer from MtGox to that one?
/edit  I should note, I'm not trying to dodge taxes here, I'll gladly pay them!
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:17:30
Don't worry.  With the diff skyrocketing by the time these ship to consumers, it will be equivalent to the hashing power of a 5770 GPU at today's diff.
To the 3-5 people who get one in the next few months..  They will make some serious coin tho. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 10:01:53
I wasn't asking if it was as good as ASIC mining, I was just wondering if anyone knew **anything** about it.  As a proof of concept I find it neat. I understand the potential folly of turning my phone into an easy bake oven for 12 hours a day.

I'd say BFL should just stop taking pre-orders and work on clearing out the backlog they already have... But by the time they do clear that backlog no one would order a new unit when they reopened the ordering system because they wouldn't be worth anything. 6 months from now a 5GH unit will be about the same as a 500MH graphics card today with the diff increase.

605 was a magic number for me after waiting all day.  Didn't fully cash out, but sold enough to cover my entire investment in hardware (GPU's) back in late Feb.  I still have some coins, and I've completely recovered all my expenses.    Everything from this point on is gravy.  
Everyone who called me geeky 9 months ago is now asking how to get in on this.
