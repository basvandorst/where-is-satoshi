While I respect your argument I believe that we are at a point where the adoption through grey-markets is less and less important as a part of the Bitcoin growth process. 
I think that changetip is probably more important to adoption than Openbazaar.
All darkwallet does is distract from a revolutionary payment system and appeals to the fringe users that bring little adoption and negative PR.

Wrong. The two main mining operations out there has both just taken in $20+ million dollars to avoid selling mined BTC. The market right now is 90% trader driven, where the trend for weeks/months have been to leverage (sell short) on a downtrend and press price.

Still not correct, try again.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:39:40
Still very possible to make a profit mining. You have to REALLY know what you are doing, have cheap power, be in it for the long term (no longer 2-3 moths ROI, more like 12) and know what equipment to purchase and at what price. 
100% agree. Newbies should NOT mine, but making it seem like you CAN'T mine profitably is plain stupid.

Wasn't my meaning to insinuate that Trucoin is corrupt. It just seems from some posts on Bitcointalk that 'Jared' that ran BTCquick is part of the team and that makes me a little uncomfortable. 
I stand corrected as Trucoin has long history and I have removed the previous post as it was obviously to an extend based on lack of knowledge of Trucoin.
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:53:31
Seriously, how stupid are you? Everyone knows (when they ordered) that Hashfast was using Bitcoin for development and production by turning it into USD and paying staff etc. 
If you thought you would be able to somehow magically get full Bitcoin refund you are pretty damn stupid. 
Before you start bitching, realize that if price of Bitcoin went the other way I can bet you would be arguing the exact opposite and demanding USD refund. 
I'm by no means arguing that Hashfast hasn't failed to deliver, or that you should not get a refund but believing there is a snowballs chance in hell that you will somehow be able to be refunded 5-7x your purchase price (in USD value) is just dumb.

So you are criticizing my argument for not being fact backed, while making an argument that is speculation backed yourself. Solid. Also $20+ million would according to YOUR OWN calculations be freshly minted coins for over two weeks even if they were 'all the sell pressure'.

There you go being stupid again. Of course you will lose money if you buy your hardware expensively, pay high power rates etc. But if you can get hardware at lowest price available and have exceptionally cheap power you can definitely mine profitably. Or are you suggesting that 300 Petahash of mining power is running at a net-loss?
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:59:20
The same 80% you would have lost, had you sold Bitcoin at the time of purchase and placed an order with USD. I don't understand how people believe that a company that relies on pre-order income for development and production would be able to, or want to pay back Bitcoin?

There is sound logic behind this. If you have free power and live somewhere (or want to be anonymous) where buying bitcoin is hard, are under 18 (makes it very hard in many countries) etc. it can still very much be ROI positive. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:12:03
Your point being? The argument here wasn't the quality of the coin but the validity of it as per the definition of a coin. Nexst, Master, Ripple are clearly not coins as they are not decentralized. Memorycoin is.

I don't think power consumption is the main issue here. Its the fact that nVidia/AMD are huge companies that take months to design reference heat sinks etc. To disburse heat and handle power etc. BFL will have literally weeks to do the same and that it IF the chip works as simulated.

I wish this subforum would do a little growing up. Sure, it's great for BitPay to get fresh capital from a clearly important Businessman from China but can we please stop the 'To the moon' mentality. This does not effect Bitcoin itself in the least (at least in the short term). We are talking a few million USD invested in a private company. It's not even a direct Bitcoin investment. Calm the fuck down and stop acting like children.

Having some insight into the economics of ASIC development I can explain this fairly easily.
With Bitcoin still not being a mainstream currency and many companies still struggling with both project financing from Venture capital and "mainstream" investors, as well as the taxation issues of how to report mined bitcoin the "Pre sales" model is a way to finance development with order funds.
To achieve profit and be able to compete with other ASIC companies customers for early pre orders are "rewarded" with high profitability (assuming successful delivery on time) for their purchase (investment).
An interesting dynamic is that as a lot of companies start being able to fund R&amp;D and production from their own profits I expect pre-orders to disappear and prices to actually increase on ASIC as diff increases become less exponential towards the new year.
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:35:24
Why not? Google Ventures invests small sums (Google Ventures by the way is completely separate from Google and works as any venture company maximizing profits) in many start ups every month. 
The fact that Ripple is a scam has nothing directly to do with the investors but rather that they launched under the guise of being a 'coin' and let their trading platform 'currency' be traded as a closed source coin at a violently bloated valuation.

Thank you all for the answers. Just as I 'figured' the numbers are a little 'floating' at current as the roll-out of high powered hardware is driving generation and diff slightly over the 'equilibrium' that the algorithm is moving for. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:07:52
Agreed, however I also think that the Gen1 ASIC situation was a VERY special one that is not likely to repeat with Gen2 ASIC. 
With 28nm (at least the faster gen2 from Cointerra, Bitmine.ch etc.) the difficulty simply has 'nowhere to go' once the most effective chips starts getting close to a ROI negative. 
By this time, ALL: GPU, FPGA, Gen1 ASIC will be ROI negative and once they drop off the Gen2 ASIC will enjoy quite some time of high ROI (possibly 12+ months). 
At least my theory.

You missed the fact that the 15 top holders are ALL employees, founders and investors in the start-up that CREATED ripple. It's not a coin by any definition of the word and an almost complete SCAM valuing a 10 people start-up with no revenue at $2 BILLION+
