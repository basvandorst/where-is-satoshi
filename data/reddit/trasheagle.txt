Price is inflating because people can't send coins out because GDAX/Coinbase isn't processing their backlog fast enough?

I hope this is true. I've helped a few 40 - 60 year old people set up wallets, but bitcoin, and explain the concepts of crypto. They seem to fear or do not understand the responsibility and consequences of controlling your privates keys. The want the perceived safety of the bank - that is what we have to overcome with people jumping in relatively blindly.

At this point I'm pretty sure you need to buy an ASIC mining device for it be profitable and really benefit the network.

I don't think this is irony.

So potentially 3 incompatible BCH node types? Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC, and the nChain version?

In a successful payment channel when does the payment hit the blockchain? Or, how is possible to move funds without ever broadcasting to the chain?

Are you using an RPi3 and did you have to side-load the chain or were you able to pull it down just with the RPi?

I've had to bike to and from work in the rain the last few days. Need a warm up.

Follow up question: Are you storing the blockchain on a separate drive or do you have a huge sdcard?

Out of curiosity, what is the easiest way to set up a mining node with Ubuntu?

Any tips for upgrading Electrum on OSX? Do I just drop in the new .app and it will read my wallet file?

Ethereum? I am relatively late to the crypto game, so I am wondering what thought on Ethereum are.

In the podcast Stark talks about how you need "receiving capacity" to get money into the network. This is thing I am trying to fully understand.
Is this correct? -&gt; To transact on the Lightning Network at least one or both parties have to prove they have the full amount of BTC they would like to transact with. So basically by "receiving capacity" she means someone (or a node, route, or collection of routes) has to front the amount of BTC that the parties want to transact with?
So in the case of an "invoice," someone (or a funded node) would need to provide the "receiving capacity" for the amount of the invoice in order for the payor to pay the invoice from their own lightning wallet?
I still think Lightning is incredible but I am trying to wrap my head around this.

I see, thanks for the info!

And if I have no addresses that start with a 3?

You missed an opportunity to explain crypto to someone who did not understand it :(

Totally, before bitcoin I just assumed that I would be working into my 70s. Now I feel like I have hope of retiring before then.

Although I do not 100% understand how the Lightning Network will be implemented, I still think it is very exciting and I hope it succeeds. That being said, this is a bit of an oversimplification.
