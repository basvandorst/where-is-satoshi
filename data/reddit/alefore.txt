You'll need to wait until:
1. Your transaction makes it to a block (more precisely: a miner includes your transaction in a block that said miner successfully manages to append to the blockchain). How long this takes depends on the fees in the transaction: your transaction is competing with the other transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain, and miners will prefer to include those that pay the highest fees per byte. Once your transaction makes it to a block, that'll be your first confirmation.
2. After  happens, you'll need to wait further, until another block is mined. That'll be the 2nd confirmation of your transaction. This will take a somewhat random amount of time (it depends on the delay for a miner to find this block), but on average that should take around 10 minutes.
So if  happened now, you're looking at another ~10 minutes way (could occasionally be a bit longer).
Hope that helps.

I was wondering about something. I'd be grateful if someone could explain it to me.
Let's assume that LN gains a lot of users and it is relatively well connected (as a graph, so that relatively few hops are required to reach any other user). In this case, why would I prefer to keep any BTC outside of the LN? In the LN, I'll be able to transfer them much faster/cheaper than otherwise. I could buy BTC through the LN rather than off, so that I don't have to open channels (and thus pay miners' fees) to move them to the LN. If this is the case... why would I, in normal circumstances (i.e., no malicious actors) want to ever close a channel (moving BTCs off the LN)?
Is the expectation that the bulk of our wealth will be in the LN most of the time? Or is it unlikely that the graph will be as well connected as I'm assuming? Or is there some other cost that I'm neglecting which makes it advantageous to close channels semi-periodically?

I've done ~6 SEPA withdrawals in December and have not had any significant delays (the usual ~2 days).
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:22:31
For what it's worth it, in December I've done six separate withdrawals adding up to around 30k EUR through Bitstamp and never had any issues. I couldn't be happier with them.

I don't understand this commonly given advice of selling enough to cover your initial investment. Why should it matter? For example, if I bought 20 BTC at $1k vs 10 BTC later at $2K, why should that in any way factor in into what the ideal course of action should be? Why is that information in any way relevant to determine the ideal exit strategy? I think it makes more sense to instead pin the ratio of my wealth that I'm willing to keep in Bitcoin and maybe adjust that ratio gradually (based on my confidence/assessment of risk). Would be happy to hear someone explain to me why I'd be better off had I quickly cashed out my initial investment.

$125 USD? Stop spreading FUD.
Here is an example transaction added to the blockchain ~15 minutes ago (as of this writing) with a 0.0017 BTC ($27 USD) fee: 
$27 USD might be relatively high, but it's about a fifth of what you're claiming...
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:53:22
But if I invested $10k which are now worth $30k, why would my "loss" (i.e. the amount I should cash out for peace of mind) be $10k? Why not the whole $30k? The way I see it, if Bitcoin crashed to zero tomorrow, I'm not losing the $10k I put in; I'm losing the potential $30k I could have cashed out today.
Another way I think makes this more evident is: imagine I put in $10k an hour ago and now they're with $10.001k. I think cashing out the $10k would be a very poor strategy. So clearly there should be a different strategy (sitting somewhere in between this "cash out initial investment" strategy and hodling), right?
Anyway, I'm not saying this advice is wrong; it could be just that I haven't been able to understand it's charm.
My current exit strategy is to cash out $5k USD every time the total value of my holdings grows by $10k. For me this is an adequate compromise in allowing my holdings to grow but improving the worst case scenarios. An alternative might be to cash out just a third of the growth instead of half. I believe very strongly in the future of cryptocurrencies, so I think I'm reducing the expected return of my investment, but I do it in order to improve the worst case scenarios.
Anyway, thanks for your reply.

Thank you for your graph! I think it makes it crystal clear that, as you say, they're critical.
I can see us break up above $7.7k, giving bulls some moderate gains, and setting us in a good path to start the weekend from a solid position that could grow even further (unless it's a bull trap that bounces back down before most traders, especially those without robust TA, can realize their gains).
However, looking at the RSI and MACD, there's also the danger that we could retrace back down under current support levels to below $6.9k or even further down (even crashing under the next Fibonacci support level), with the bears burning the moderate sell walls around the $7k price point, in which case we'll be at a worse position than right now and I'd then posit it'd be wise of savvy traders to revisit the different scenarios.

You come across as incredibly arrogant, like r/im14andthisisdeep. It almost sounds as if you thought that trading successfully for a year or two and being able to read basic charts and perhaps a few advanced indicators made you an experienced trader.
In any case, I wish you luck. Congratulations on your accomplishments. May your knowledge and wealth continue to grow.

What on Earth was that on btc.eur in Bitstamp?
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:36:44
Why are you fixated on the ATH? It almost makes you look dishonest, as if you had some agenda and wanted to manipulate things to support some predetermined conclusion. You could instead pick the lowest it has been in, say, the last year, or the last five years, or whatever, and compare with that, to support the complete opposite conclusion.
Yes, it reached that $20K very briefly in an incredible spike, but if you just look at the big picture you can see that it's massive gains all over. For example, if you had been dca each week for a while, it's incredibly likely you'd be up currently.

Sorry for raining on your parade, but that makes no sense.
If a given entity got a hold of, say, 90% mined bitcoins (which is already waaaay too generous) and locked them away, it would just increase the value of the remaining 10% by a large margin. people would just continue to use Bitcoin as usual. Instead of paying 0.27000000 BTC for something, you'd just start paying 0.02700000 BTC or some such. Business as usual. Your foreign actors now only have access to 10% of mined bitcoins, but each is now worth some 10x more. They're divisible enough that this wouldn't change anything (and, even if they weren't, that would then very likely be fixed quickly).
Obviously, it'd be great for hodlers, but it's naive to think that central banks wouldn't realize how massively pointless this would be.

It is a misquote: the context mentions ETH and LTC as prominently as BTC *and* they list them just as examples of the term they're defining. His edited quote conveys a significantly different meaning (that BTC is the single cryptocurrency they've picked).
"This [overcoming this challenges on a global scale] is only possible on [L2 protocols on] top of Bitcoin" vs "This is only possible on top of DID systems; examples of DID systems are BTC, LTC, ETH."
If that's not a misquote...

Agree, Cheeseboxcity is full of shit. Hundreds of coins with 100000% growth since Jan 2017, LOL. "Anyone selling BTC under $300k is an idiot." Sigh. Can't even lie convincingly, probably thinks based on YouTube videos he hardly grasps that he's a great trader, and takes his frustrations of not having anything of value to say out by littering Reddit with insults like "you utter lampshade", "how can you go through life being this slow", or "you table top". Please don't feed the troll.
Edit: Looks like Cheeseboxcity and the other poster removed their posts. Cheeseboxcity was claiming that there are hundreds of coins such that if you invested $100 in Jan 2017, you'd now have at least $1m worth. The other poster was calling him on this nonsense.

And 7h later... at $7.9k. But of course you know better than all the "idiots"...

Nobody else bothered by the fact that the Python code in that image is full of boilerplate and should instead be just the following?

It's relatively simple.
First I created and secured my wallet (including encrypting it, and making and testing a backup). I did this by downloading Bitcoin Core and running it in my laptop, but you could use any other wallet software.
Once I was confident in my secure but empty wallet, I went to the exchange (I used bitstamp.net, but I suppose other exchanges are similar). I created an account, got it validated (involved uploading a photo of and ID), and did a SEPA transfer of euros from my bank (SEPA is a standard way to transfer money in Europe; in this case I transferred to a bank account given to me in the exchange's website). Two or three days later, the exchange's website showed my euros. At that point I just put an order to buy Bitcoin (simple operation in the exchange's website), and then did a withdraw to an address in my Bitcoin wallet (another simple operation in the exchange's website).
I did this first with a smaller amount of money, to test that it all worked, and then with the bulk of what I intended to invest.

Not disagreeing or anything, but as a fellow mid 30 year old also somewhat invested in BTC, what do you base your beliefs in?
Just curious, hope you don't mind my asking!
P.s.: My current strategy is to fix a percentage of my net wealth on BTC and keep it pinned, selling occasionally (to bring it back down to that percentage) as it grows. I believe strongly in BTC but I don't want to discount the risk.

Ah, a flawless execution of the classic buy high, sell low strategy. Sorry for your loss. Have an upvote.
I've been buying all along as it dipped further and further (through limit orders set long ago). I'm actually ... fairly excited it dipped like this (probably because I still strongly believe in it's long term value).

My advice to you would be that, in the future, you consider in advance all the scenarios you can anticipate and prepare for them: formulate for each a plan, where you describe exactly what you'll do, and why. Make it as formal as you can (for example, I personally have parts of this codified as a script that runs every ten minutes in some cloud provider to check the state and update my limit orders; but even if you're not a programmer, still describe in English in some journal what steps you'll take in each possible case).
Once you do this, sticking to your plan (i.e., not trading based on emotions) should be easier, because you will have already decided rationally, with plenty of time, the optional course of action.
Hope that helps and sorry for your loss.
