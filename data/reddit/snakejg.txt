Tell anyone who lost their Bitcoin private keys, had their exchange hacked, or in any other way permanently lost their Bitcoin about the great value in Bitcoin being tamper proof.  I understand and appreciate why Bitcoin is the way it is, but there is definitely value to FDIC insurance.
Hell, I lost almost all of my Bitcoin when ASICminer just decided to shut down with no warning.  Sure, my own fault, I was greedy and saw it as a way for my Bitcoin to earn me more Bitcoin, but any real company wouldn't be able to do something like that to its shareholders.
Point is, Bitcoin is still the wild west, and while that comes with a lot of bonuses, protection for individuals and stability are not among them.

Seriously, this is 8 GB blocks in 20 years.  Why would we ever need an 8 GB block.  How many transactions would that be every 10 minutes?
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:52:01
For comparison, the total US credit and debit card transactions were 122.8 billion for 2012.  So, that's looking at bitcoin supporting around 8 times the total card transactions for the US.  When you count in the rest of the world and growth, it isn't too crazy of a number, but boy, is the network going to be taxed if we ever see transactions near the 8GB block rate.

Even if bandwidth, storage, and CPU growth continue to increase at ~50% a year, there isn't any reason block size has to.  Financial transactions don't grow at 50% per year.  Sure, bitcoin currently has a very small piece of the total financial transaction pie, so it makes sense to grow the block size more aggressively for some period, but soon you'll just end up with block size growth for no reason.
Your initial bump in block-size to ~400 million transactions per day is enough to process half of all of the credit and debit card transactions of the World.  Only modest increases after that could possibly be required.  


At 50% growth rate, that Bitcoin hobbyist will have to replace their computer every 2 years.  50% * 1.5 * 1.5 =&gt; 112.5% of their CPU power.  Even my most upgrade-hungry friends don't replace their computers every 2 years.  I'm approaching 4 years on my CPU and I expect at least 2 more out of it.  You run into the same problem with Internet bandwidth, improvements come in discrete jumps which might not happen frequently enough to keep up.
Nielsen’s and Moore's Laws might keep marching on for decades, but it would be great if those improvements made Bitcoin more accessible, instead of just letting very dedicated hobbyists keep up.  There are plenty of other growth functions available that don't run away like exponential does.  Linear, n log n, polynomial
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:27:34
He picked exponential growth, so yeah, he failed to take this into account.  He mentions being able to do 56 billion transactions a day in 12 years.  If that's his goal, he should pick a linear growth rate that will achieve it, since I doubt he thinks we need over 7 Trillion transactions a day in 24 years.  
As a point of comparison, there were only 26.2 billion credit transactions in the United States in all of 2012 (and probably around 10 times that globally).  I think bitcoin will grow as much as the rest of you, but I don't think there are going to be 10,000 times as many bitcoin transactions in 2038 as there were credit card transactions in 2012.

I want to improve network scalability, but this solution seems like a bad idea, since it introduces a rather fast exponential growth into the protocol.  
The growth in block sizes at 50% a year is pretty crazy and will greatly increase the storage requirements for clients and miners.  This could also open the block chain to attacks by bad actors.  Within a decade, a mining company could greatly increase their storage capacity and then make sure their blocks are always full.  This could give them a competitive advantage if other miners have to go offline or get more storage to keep up.  In addition, the network delays involved in other miners getting the updated blocks might be a competitive advantage even without any other storage shenanigans.  A smart miner could map the network in such a way that their blocks would quickly reach 50+% saturation, but would be delayed in arriving to a competitor.

I think vigilantpa1adin was talking about a fixed-rate mortgage.  If you need the 5k to pay closing costs to refinance to a much lower rate (ideally fixed) than it would be a good use of the money.  If you are just trying to pay down your balance some because rates are low on your variable rate mortgage, I don't think it is a good use of the money.  Here's why:
* Mortgage interest payments are tax deductible, so you'd be better off investing that $5k somewhere else.  Especially if you haven't maxed out your IRA or 401(k) contributions for the year.  Putting the $5k in your IRA would let you deduct all $5k and also still get the extra deduction on your mortgage interest (subject to earning limitations).
* Paying more into a mortgage is a **very** non-liquid investment.  If next month you lose your job and need that $5k, you can't get it from your mortgage without refinancing, which takes weeks and has high fees associated (~$3k).  Paying off an extra $5k now also doesn't allow you to skip a future payment, so again, very little flexibility if something goes wrong.
* If you pay off extra mortgage when the rates are low, it is like getting that lower rate as your return on investment.  So it would be better to put extra money into the mortgage when rates are high.

Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund or a Vanguard target retirement fund.  Not sexy, but pretty damn safe and you could expect the money to double every 7-10 years.  I would put $150k there.  It will probably be worth over a million when you are ready to retire in 20-30 years.
Edit: 
The absolute worst return in a 20 year period of the S&amp;P 500 was still 6.4%, at that rate you'd have 520k after 20 years and 900k after 30.  If you get an average return(10%), you'll have a million after 20 years and 2.6 million after 30.

Spreading out the purchases would be [Dollar cost averaging or DCA](  If you believe bitcoins will be trending upwards, then DCA is a bad idea, since on average, you'll be buying more and more expensive bitcoins as time goes on.  In the case up upward trending, a lump sum investment would be better.
If you think bitcoins are going to be generally static, at least during the period of your buying, then DCA has the advantage of helping you avoid buying all of your bitcoins at an artificial high time.
I like the idea of having some bitcoins around in anticipation of future growth, but it is a rather risky investment.  It is a small, unregulated market, so it is a lot more volatile than stocks and is a lot more exposed to market manipulation.  Additionally, someone might hack your computer or the site you store bitcoins on.  
I would not make a huge investment in bitcoins.  So if you have 100k in your portfolio, investing 10k into bitcoins isn't a bad idea, but if you just have 20k or so, you are risking an awful lot.  Think of all of those people who bought at $30.

I'd probably take the bitcoin gamble (normally I suggest S&amp;P 500 index funds, not given as an option).  $10k isn't going to be life changing for me, and even if it doubles or triples in value.  Bitcoin is the only one that has a chance of going up 10x over that period (getting it to the life-changing level).
Ask the same question about $100k, and I'll definitely take it in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, or if I have to choose between the options provided, 10-yr treasury bonds.

That's true I'm general economic theory, not true in the question of a single commodity, such as Bitcoin.  Every Bitcoin you buy that later goes up, means the person who sold it missed out on those gains.  
I guess if you want to get complicated enough, you have to see what else that money could do for a person, so both can win.  Example, someone might need cancer treatment, so selling their Bitcoin to pay for it, even if that Bitcoin later goes up, was still a net gain for the seller.

You aren't really deterring income though, it isn't like anyone says "taxes are too high, I'm not going to work anymore"

And even with all of that government tracking, you still can't make a consumption tax as progressive as you like, because the rich do not spend all of their money (or even a large fraction of it), so no matter the tax rate on consumption, there would be huge swaths of income you couldn't tax at all.

I have to agree.  I'm a big fan of bitcoin, but it is never going to be secure for the average(dumb) user.  My Wallet sites can be targeted by phishing e-mails, or hacked into.  Lots of users have malware running rampant on their computers.  Combine all of this with the irreversibility of transactions, and you have a very insecure system for the average user.  Even worse, once things go bad, there is no getting them back.

ATI Tray Tools is great. I underclock and undervolt my HD 5770 card. Memory speed doesn't appear to matter at all, and hashing rate is directly proportional to clock speed. Instead of running at 850 Mhz and having my fan going crazy and using an extra 100 watts over my idle levels, I'm running at 650 Mhz and only using 30 watts over idle levels. I get 136 Mhash/s at 650 instead of 177 Mhash/s at 850. You can also setup a "game profile" for your miner, which will automatically put your GPU back to normal after you close the miner. You can also create a shortcut for your game profile on your desktop, and have ATI Tray Tools exit once you leave the miner.

The attacker couldn't cause inflation on the system, since the bitcoins that the seller initially thought were sent to them would instead be back in the attacker's wallet.  The seller wouldn't be able to spend them.
If I had control of over half of the bit coin mining ability, I'd use it to just mine.  I would hide that one entity is mining the bit coins, so the belief in bitcoins will remain, and I could sell my stock off slowly whenever I wanted.  Unless I'm making huge transactions, getting 50 bit coins every 20 minutes would probably be a better return than trying to double spend anything I currently had.  Plus, if I started to double spend, soon people would notice and everyone would stop using bit coin, causing me to lose all of the value I had.

This isn't how interest rates work.  If you put 1 bitcoin into a bank and they only give you 0.8 bitcoins back, you are using a horrible stupid bank, and you shouldn't do it.  You would have been better off just keeping your 1 bitcoin.
What you are implying is that the bank will take your bitcoin, change it into USD, give you some interest rate on that USD amount, and then allow you to take out your USD as bitcoins later, at whatever the exchange rate is.  That isn't a bitcoin bank, it is a bank that accepts bitcoins for USD deposits.
A real bitcoin bank/credit union will do fractional reserve lending entirely in bitcoin.  The bank wouldn't care what the exchange rate between bitcoin and USD is, because it would only work in bitcoin.  It will give you a rate of return in entirely in bitcoin (supported by lending bitcoin).

They really can't/shouldn't.  In a datacenter environment, the highest cost you have is electricity/heat.   For every additional Watt you use, you have to cool that watt, you also have to provided redundant power to that watt.  Not just redundant in that you probably have two power supplies in the server, but redundant in that you need a larger power back-up system.  Batteries and generators usually, big enough to power the servers and their cooling.
Large companies are willing to spend gobs of money to reduce power consumption, it would be counterproductive to ramp up their power to full usage just for some bit coin.

In a few years is when bitcoin will actually be very interesting.  
Right now, there is the large built-in incentive to mine, but once blocks start only earning bitcoins based on transaction fees, mining will rely on enough people using bitcoins in day-to-day transactions to make it worth while.  
If everyone just hoards their bitcoins, soon the whole system will break down, as no trades would result in no mining and no trust in the system.  On the other hand, if bitcoin is a thriving medium of exchange, a block could very well provide more than the 50 bitcoins it currently does.

The big advantage of a larger pool is that you are more likely to get a constant payout.  Slush's pool is huge, and so is likely to win any given block.  The downside of everyone joining slush's pool is that it drives down competition in the pool industry, allowing him to continue charging 2% (instead of a much more reasonable 1% or 0.5%).  Think of the money that he is pulling (pooling, har!) in at that rate, without having to mine a single block himself.

Bitcoins are actually extremely open to manipulation because they are not protected by an authority.  Nobody regulates the bitcoin trading markets, so people with large amounts of assets are able to manipulate the price at will.

That actually sounds like a great way to earn money via bitcoin, resell some mining hardware, the demand is high.

It really isn't, and you can do it with bitcoin easily.
I could open a bank, and offer to pay interest.  You would transfer say 100 BTC into my bank.  I would keep a fraction of that in reserve and lend the rest out for interest.  All of the bitcoins will actually be transferred to the borrowers, and if you tried to withdrawal your money, because I have a fraction of everyone's deposits in my vault, I would just give you all of your bitcoins.
With a fractional reserve of 20%, the bank is safe as long as no more than 1 in 5 people try to withdraw all of their money.  If you need more safety, the fractional reserve could be higher, but the amount kept in reserve **must** be less than 100%, otherwise the bank would have no way to make money and pay interest.

Fractional reserve is not the "greedy banker's way of minting money", it is only lending money that is physically present.
If you want to have the account structure that ensures someone is depositing the 30 bitcoins for a given number of days, that's a certificate of deposit (or a CD).  Even if you have a bank that only does CDs, that bank will still have to practice fractional reserve banking, to protect themselves and their depositors from someone defaulting on the loans.
Fractional reserve banking is not evil, or minting money.  It is the only way you can have interest paying saving accounts.  Without it, the banks would charge you for holding your money safely (they used to do this back in the days with gold, and still happens with safety deposit boxes)

I wonder how long of a delay there is before getting your coins sent to where you want them.  
This is how I envision the system works:
Bitcoinlaundry keeps an ever changing pool of fake addresses, and sends coins into multiple locations in the pool.  These coins will go from address to address in the pool in a weighted random way to imitate normal bitcoin activity (including delays).   Some transactions will come from multiple addresses into one, others will go from one to multiple.  Once coins have been in the pool long enough (again, determined randomly...perhaps each hop, they have a 1% chance of declaring they've been in the pool long enough), they can be sent to a target address.  The coins sent to a given target are therefore unlikely to have been initially sourced from the associated input address, but instead one or multiple other input addresses.
As I see it, my implementation could have one disadvantage, law enforcement might seed it with a known addresses and then track that movement, letting them map out portions of the pool (especially since they'd also have a known output address).  If they do this enough and get lucky, they might be able to isolate whole strands of addresses in the pool and therefor identify other laundering.
Instead of this site, I think the best way to launder is to use multiple foreign exchanges.  Put bitcoins in a foreign exchange, sell them and then buy new ones with the money (or sometimes just withdraw the same bitcoins).  Do this w/ a couple of exchanges in different countries/continents, and it would be very hard to track, since only by subpenaing (or hacking) all of those exchanges could law enforcement (or other) follow the bitcoin trail.

It is because GPU's are much much better at tasks that are simple and can be run in parallel.  Searching for different hashes is a perfectly parallel task.  Unit 1 can search hash 1, unit 2 can search hash 2, etc...

I would have much preferred a blog post to a video, perhaps with a small video showing his mining setup.  A video of a power point presentation however is slightly annoying.
Having said that, the content was still very interesting and I agree, buying the equipment is better, since it is a less 'crazy' investment.

I only have fractional Bitcoin remaining, got burned on buying asicminer stock back in the day (sadly not at the IPO), and I haven't really paid attention to the marketplaces since mtgox.  What's the best place for​ me to sell a third of a Bitcoin at and actually get my money with ease?
@_date: 2011-05-29 06:58:18


Banks can never lend out as much money as they have on deposit, because if one person tried to remove their money, the bank wouldn't be able to pay them.  Instead banks do fractional reserve banking, keeping a fraction of the deposits in a vault, and lending out the rest.  This way, even if multiple people want their money, the bank has enough to cover it.  This is also why a bank pays higher interest rates on certificates of deposit, which unlike a savings account, the customer can't remove the money until a given period of time.
Banks also have to charge an even higher interest rate on loans to make up for the fact that they can't force people not to default on their loans.  This is especially true in the bitcoin system, where they can't connect bitcoins to actual people.

So at $18/day, that's a year of mining to pay off the solar which isn't bad since solar lasts about 10-15 years and if you keep moving up miner levels that works fine as long as the difficulty doesn't shoot up faster than the value of Bitcoin.  You also have the worry that you might not be able to resell the miners.
You are leaving out some overhead (property costs, etc) but yeah, I could see this being at least sustainable and providing reasonable profit if nothing goes wrong, but it isn't surefire free money.  Initial capital investment is high, it requires a decent amount of work to setup and for you to be in the desert.  If already in the desert, sure is worth it otherwise I'll be taking a pass.

I've wondered what is the proper way to report bitcoin income as a miner.  I know how to do so as an investor, when I sell bitcoins, I pay capital gains taxes on the increase in value since I purchased them.
My best thought on how to pay taxes as a miner would be to treat it as a small business.  You have your costs like electricity and hardware (don't forget to depreciate it) and you have your income from selling your bitcoins.  
Now, if you instead held onto your bitcoins after mining them, would they become an investment?  As in, pay small business income tax on the value of your bitcoins when mined and capital gains tax on the difference when you sell.  Or because you never bought them, do you just pay income tax on it all?
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:06:19
So, there is a difference between income and capital gains (mainly that you pay a lot less taxes on capital gains).  To use your painter example, a painter pays income on paintings they sell.  But an art collector pays capital gains if he buys a painting and later sells it for more.
It makes sense to say a painter can't paint his painting, declare it worth $1000 and then sell it a year later for $10000, and claim $9000 in capital gains and only $1000 in income.

With the size of the transactions,  you'll probably want to do a check of market depth before deciding on how much to value a bitcoin at.  A sell of $20k+ could easily drop the price of bitcoin a bit.

Basically the only feasible way to mine for a bitcoin address is if the random number generator used to create it was somehow broken.  If the random number generator is truly random, you would have to do a brute force attack.
In order to brute force a single bitcoin private key, it takes approximately 2^128 operations (approximately 3x10^38 ).  This is nearly an unfathomably huge number.  The fastest super computer in the world clocks in at 33 petaflops (approximately 3x10^16 operations per second).  So, it would take approximately 10^22 seconds to brute force a single private key on the worlds fastest supercomputer.  This is **316,887 BILLION YEARS**.  23,000 times longer than the age of the universe.
Edit: If you wanted to try to "guess", you would probably want to figure out the most common processor in use back in 2009, set the system clock of said processor to 2009, run winXP with only 2009's updates on it, and have a program just constantly telling an early version of the bitcoin client to generate address.  Maybe you'll get lucky?
**TL;DR:** The universe will likely cease to exist before you could mine a single bitcoin address on today's fastest supercomputer.

Technically, if someone sells you something under fair market value, they have given you a gift.  They would owe gift taxes on what they've given you.  You would not owe extra taxes as a result of receiving the gift.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:46:03
No need to, it was a gift.  Now if it appreciates, you'll have to pay the capital gains when you sell it.

If you still have the hard drive, and you haven't been downloading a lot or filling it up to the brim, there is still a chance the coins could be recovered, since the data might not have been physically overwritten.
