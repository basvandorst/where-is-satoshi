Sounds grand.  /s
Right now, it's a solution looking for a problem, everyone is getting played.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:11:19


Let's use a 16MB block size as an example.... can you provide **specifics** of how/why, etc?


What about the on-chain technology being developed for this?   What about zero-conf transactions?


I agree.   We should assess layer 2 "solutions" with this same spotlight.


You only need one?  What is the problem with that?   Forks are not bad if the ecconomic inventives for people to follow are sound.


How could you do that?   Anyone can fork a chain at anytime.  How do you "undo" this.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:03:17
Then do it.   Fee paying transactions are not spam.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:05:46
You don't need a 'lightning network' to do atomic swaps.   &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:12:41


Why? Why? Why?
The ability to scale to ~visa level transactions exists today! .... and we don't even need to go that far.   Just the ability to accomodate the 2018 level of transactions will be fine.


Why?   Good, fair, decentralized and secure versions of these are long way away from being mature.


Increasing the bock size (moderately) does **not** qualify as rushing engineering, the work has been going on for years to support it.


... but you CAN, it isn't a scam.

Open for debate  ;) ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:54:00
No, the whole point of a hard fork, is not everyone agrees.
"consensus" depends on hashpower.   ie. do enough people agree to keep a change alive.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:53:56
I mean the 2x part of Segwit2x.
They didn't want segwit, but agreed to it to get an orderly increase in the block size (with out needing to split the network) .... so they were "clamoring" for the 2x part.

What choice does he have?   He's a massive bitcoin proponent, who sees the problems with bitcoin ... so?   What else would he promote?


No other coin can take bitcoins role as a currency.  They all have one flaw or another which means they are broken.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:59:23


That article is old and was debunked so so hard.


... and none of that even relies on any of the updates which are coming to the code to support better scaling  (most scaling limits in the large block tests have been code, not hardware) ..... but we shouldn't rely on things which aren't here yet ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:14:02


Go on, tell us why you think it is there?
 - Why was it initially put there?
 - Why did the people who put it there say it should be eventually removed?
 - Why do other people think it should be kept?
People should know the details of these, so they can be aware of the counter arguments  ;)
Not that it matters.  Block scaling works, and it is being used .... so everyone will see eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:28:21


I don't think you should lump ME into any "you guys" bucket.   I'm here alone.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:33:20


That time was literally years ago.   It's just sad that it took until August 1 2017, for anything real to be done about it.
You got your blocksize increase... and also we became free of all the (bad) things which were done in the name of fixing the "scaling problem"  (or the high fee symptom).
Segwit.   Gone.
Replace by fee.   Gone.
Lightning Network.   Not needed.


You have a choice (but not the one you think).  Choose the chain which has the block size increase (and a plan to never make block congestion a possible attack ever again) ... or choose the network with high fees, long queues, and segwiit/lightning cancer.
If you think you (as the"community") have a choice about what happens to development on the BTC chain.  You are sadly mistaken - the historical records of this are all over the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:32:03
Good for him.  I would do the same if I were him.  Bitcoin is a free and capitalisist market.
Bitcoin is broken.  There is an opportunity to undo the broken bits of bitcoin .... There is an opportunity to invest your money in "not-broken-bitcoin", and potentially make more money.
Who wouldn't go for that?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:23:43


Exactly.   Nodes == miners .... and so consensus = miners = hash power.
It is only those nodes which are enforcing the rules of the block chain, AND participating in adding new blocks (ie. proving hash power), which do anything relevant.
.... and so for Bitcoin Cash to have any "consensus" .... it needs to have enough hash power on its chain.  Which it does.
If it did not, it would be dead.  ie.  no support from anyone.


Sure.... but you must understand WHY.   Bitcoin added segwit (and allowed the block size to become a unintended limitation) .... so Bitcoin Cash forked, and this is exactly what the vocal supporters of small blocks and high fees ASKED for.
So don't be salty about it.    You got what you wanted, enjoy your BTC chain.   To any person with knowledge of the history and a 3 digit IQ, BCH looks more like the 'original' bitcoin, so I hope it gets the adoption it deserves.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:14:12
Exactly... it's all about the mining power.   If you don't have any adoption you won't have any mining power, and you will die.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:13:30


... and how does this affect the network in anyway?   It doesn't! .... It doesn't DO anything, becuase these nodes are not adding blocks to the chain.   All it will do, is alert you to non-compliant transactions (ie. let you know that the miners have 'cheated').    But if the miners already cheated, then the cryptonomics is already broken, and the game is over - so it in effect achieves nothing.


Miners also run nodes .... unless you mine in a pool, which then your pool is running the node(s).    Non-mining nodes may validate transactions, but the result of this has no effect, as they have no say in what is added to a block.


Correct ... only the nodes (mining nodes) can decide which software is run.    "non-mining" nodes like you describe, can also decide what software to run, but they can be instantly forked off the network by the miners, if the miners choose to run something else.


It has nothing to do with it increasing in value.    Perhaps you should go read up on how the bitcoin network economics are actually designed?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:26:35

@_date: 2017-12-16 20:45:09
Mining attack?  (Please explain)  More people went to mine the BCH chain becuase it was more profitable.   It's a simple as that.   Miners are supposed to do exactly what is best for themselves (to expect otherwise is naive) - bitcoins is designed so that is the same thing as what is best for the network.
If you don't think there is (also) 'market manipulation' in the BTC market, then I think you are completely deluded.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:42:59


If it confirms next block, and you can't "Replace by fee", then it is quite safe.   Now it is quite UNsafe.




High fees, long waits?   You fine with that?    Niiiiice.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:28:59
Yeah, whoops me.   5 and bit weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:41:12


... and how does this affect the safety (or otherwise) of zero-conf transactions?    (You said segwit makes zero-conf safer)


The short term impact is nothing (there is no security problem), the long term impact is less on chain transactions.


What do they do then???    They validate transactions.... and then, what?    If they invalidate a transaction, that has no effect on the network, as they are not building a blockchain.


I have not got my head stuck in the sand.   You make a case as to what it is that non-mining nodes DO, (be detailed please) .... and I'll listen.  Go.


If you think that I learned what I know about bitcoin from reddit, then you are very very naive.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:18:00


Not me :)


I can see why people might say that.   The accusation is that Bitcoin Cash 'people' are trying to trick others into mistaking BCH for BTC.
... when really what they're saying is that BCH is more like 'bitcoin' (ie. P2P electronic cash) than BTC is.
Personally, I just want people to know Bitcoin was broken on purpose by people with agendas, and that there is an alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:12:36


Please watch the video explaining segwit, and then you will see the significance of this.


Interesting.   They need to update the whitepaper then (page 2 is wrong).    /s
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:23:43


Which parts?   My understanding is that it is a fair assessment of the effects of segwit.
Although like he says, he's not super super worried about it .... but the real killer is simply that it is a (poor) solution to a problem which does not exist (scaling limit is fiction, and tx malleability is a non-issue).


In what way?   Please be specific.


I agree.   It's better to talk about each change on its individual merits.  If it's 'good', then I would typically welcome the change.    I can address each of the changes mentioned individually and explain why they are bad.   Please provide information why you don't agree.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:08:52


More misunderstanding?  If there are enough honest nodes ... and you attack **one**.... nothing happens to bitcoin.
Are you suggesting instead to attack all the nodes at once?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:52:33


It MIGHT result in a hard fork.... if people choose to change something in response which requires a hard fork .... and in the case of Bitcoin Cash, yes that's exactly what happened.
Core put up a soft fork for segwit ....which meant people had NO CHOICE (but to change something else to cause a hard fork).
If they had of implemented segwit as a hard fork .... then there could have been a CHOICE.   People could follow the chain with segwit or without segwit..... but core DIDN'T want to do that, because they KNEW that miners would not follow segwit.... becuase the miners didn't WANT segwit.
... so BS/Core tried to play them.   Promise them a block size increase, if they agree to segwit .... most agreed.
... but not all.  Some did hard fork, and create Bitcoin Cash.


No.   Do you not think that the bugs in S2X were intentional?   They were that simple.


Garzik was a "core" dev until 22 August....   but I do mean the "devs of S2X" .... my point is that CEOs or users, or anyone, except devs and miners  (who can potentially be the same people if they want to be)  are the ones who had a say.    "Agreements" are smoke and mirrors until the code is being used to mine blocks.


Unless you are a miner (which you might be, I don't know) then how would that change anything?


Naive to expect miners to be altruistic .....   bitcoin is built on the premise that miners will do what is in their own economic interests, and is designed so that what is in the miners interest is also in the interest of the network.


How?   Those same miners can just use the new PoW.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:08:04


Bitcoin Cash was accused of being centralized and heaving "leaders" .... and so calling himself the CEO (when he is not at all) is his attempt at satire.... becuase he is not the leader (there is none), and the "letter" he wrote doesn't represent Bitcoin Cash - that's the point.
I can only imagine that choosing CEO as the title was a stab at Adam Back &lt;shrug&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:28:48


You should probably stop sharing historical blocks with out of date peers ;) .... the cuts down on the volume of data drastically.
Otherwise the *bandwidth* requirements, are not the extreme, although a reliable connection is very helpful if you need to be well connected.


It turns out that the bottleneck is less about the internet connection, due to things like xthin...  and some of the new improvements coming down the pipe line are going to make things super efficient.   It's very exciting.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:33:45


I don't think I am.    I'm saying that when you are updating the UTXO, in bitcoin it is impossible to update the UTXO without the signature of the previous owner.
.... with segwit, it IS possible - becuase to update it, you take a hash of the transaction, which DOESN'T include the previous owners signature.    Have a look at the slide, and see what I mean.
If you can explain what is wrong with the reasoning in the slide - then everyone will be the wiser.
The logical fallacy of "who the reasoning came from" isn't particularly useful.   It's whether or not it is correct (and WHY) which is what matters.  I have no specific 'loyalty' to BU or PeterR, or anyone, and it's difficult to talk to you when you treat me like I do.


I don't understand that.   I'm just reiterating the point(s) in the video about segwit.
If you can detail why any of them are wrong, that would be helpful to people.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:24:08


Indeed.  Segwit should have been a hardfork, so people had the choice of a competing chain to follow - and let the hashpower decide, which is the way it's supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:32:03


They're both versions of the same thing (bitcoin).  That's what a fork IS.
- One has segwit and replace by fee
- Other has neither of those, and larger blocks
One is called Bitcoin, the other is called Bitcoin Cash.
Sometimes people call them Bitcoin Segwit, and Bitcoin Cash ... to be very specific about which they mean.


I think not.  Bitcoin Cash only survives because enough people choose to mine the chain.  That will only continue to happen if there is enough use/adoption of Bitcoin Cash....   It has no relevance to Bitcoin (Segwit)
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:41:16


Each node maintains a ledger of which coins belong to who (UTXO)
Receive a new block, and then add/remove from your UTXO set
For Bitcoin the outputs are defined by the hash, and this has includes the signature of the previous owner - so it is impossible to update the UTXO set without the previous owners signature
For Segwit, this is not necessary.  You can update the UTXO set, without looking at the previous owners signature.   The previous owners signature does not even need to exist.
It becomes -possible- to take someones coins without their signature ?!  (!!!!!)    Sure, this would need orchestration to avoid orphans, and miners would need to be sure the economic incentives would hold  (that people would abandon the chain).
Think of situation like everyone agrees to confiscate Kim Jong Un's BTC.... ?!


No, that's not what is being suggested.


I'm not.


I'm talking about something in the video...   Please talk about THAT.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:23:13


"If all transactions in a block do not have witness data, the commitment is optional"
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:51:44
Becuase Segwit was already done... and no sane person wants full blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:10:35


"they" don't write code... right /s
There is nothing stopping a miner from running their own version of software, aside from the economic incentives involved with a fork or otherwise breaking the network.
What do you think "bcash" IS?...  People (some who are miners) started running their own version of the software, with changes.


That's exactly what is devious about it, by having backwards compatibility, you avoid a forked chain, thus avoiding the CHOICE.   It was marketed to the users as something it wasn't.


This doesn't even make sense.  Corporate CEOs had no say.   The devs and miners have the say.   The devs TOOK that say away from miners, by putting bugs in the code so the Segwit2x fork never activiated  (it got stuck on the previous block).




No... they're just doing what everyone should expect of miners.... following the economic incentives, which currently means mining the BTC chain.


95% were *signalling* for S2X support (which is not surprising, as everyone wants blocks that are not full).
... but S2X didn't go through - becuase it had bugs which prevented it from going through - becuase BS/Core didn't WANT it to go through - becuase they want small blocks
... which nobody wants.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:43


EXACTLY.    (Too much) centralisation of mining nodes is what will lead to failure ... as it will become difficult to guarantee that the majority of them will behave honestly.    That's the whole point.
The cost difference in running a 1M block node and a 8M blocks, (or even an 800M block node, and that's using -todays- prices) ... is not a significant capex/opex for a miner (ie. a large mining pool - as this is the only way to mine effectively).
YES, centralisation of mining nodes is THE issue.   The one and only problem is that a majority of mining nodes need to bahave honestly.
... but the cost of running a 1M or 8M or much bigger node, doesn't not affect the problem.


That's simply not what the white paper or Satoshis comment (and other comments on it) say.    The security is provided by nodes which participate in finding new blocks ..... other nodes may serve as a 'warning signal' if bitcion DOES break.... but then it's already broken  (via centralisation of mining power) ... and so like you say - what needs to be prevented is (too much) centralisation of mining nodes, and this doesn't happen by keeping blocks artificially small.
IN FACT .... there are ways which small blocks (and high fees) are actually leading to centralisation pressure.  Small miners have transaction fees as a higher relative opex cost to larger miners.  There was a thread running about it recently.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:21:58


It doesn't need any, that was the whole point of the hard fork.   People conspired to push a ficticious problem (scaling) ... and some other people said "no worries, we'll 'fix' the problem".
The only sad thing is how long it too, for people to do so emphatically.   The debate went on literally **years** too long.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:24:20


I didn't say that.
The reality is that a block size increase (even a big increase) isn't (at all) going to cause centralized mining, even a little bit.
"Centralized" mining also isn't as MUCH of a problem as some people might imagine - not saying it's a complete non-issue, but most people seem to misunderstand how the ecconomic incentives work.   Even if miners become big enough to collude, it is not in their ecconomic incencentive to do so.


These are childish debating tactics.  0_o
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:10:48


I don't necessarily disagree with you.


I don't see the evidence for that


Unfortunately (as we all love bitcoin) that doesn't exist any longer.    Bitcoin is fucked by segwit, fullblocks and unsafe zero-conf.   That being so, it is frightening that the price continues to soar.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:15:44
This.  1M was chosen becuase at the time is was HUGE (and not even close to being filled).   The discussion at the time agreed that the 'ideal' block size was one which as not full.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:07:28
You mean like the other highest profile fork, Ethereum.   The people who forked, decided to KEEP the name (via a rigged vote), and the original chain had to change to Ethereum Classic.
In Ethereum case, the fork CHANGED the original advertised rules (code is law) ... so really didn't deserve to keep the name.
In the Bitcoin case, the fork KEPT the original rules .... and it was the original/BTC chain which implemented new contentious rules (segwit, and of course, full blocks).
I think BTC is just lucky that Bitcoin Cash had the decency to call it "Bitcoin Cash" ... and not just try to call it "Bitcoin" and cause a big blow up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:25:54
.... but bitcoin IS defective and insecure...  so?!
We should be doing something about it!  Why aren't you angry?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:53:04


You have to trust 3rd parties
It has a much higher network distance than bitcoin, and so it open to sybil attacks
You have to commit to payment channels


It's not.  Changes to the white paper should be each addressed on their merits.    Segwit, RBF, full blocks, and lightning are all pure stink.


I don't... and extremely important aspect of bitcoin is that the majority of nodes (mining nodes) behave honestly, and in the best interest of the network.   This requires more than a certain amount of decentralization - hence decentralization is important.
If you are inferring that increasing the block size by one or two orders of magnitude will lead to centralization - then this has been shown to be incorrect (it can be done on todays hardware, and the cost is relatively insignificant)


2000 tx/s has been demonstrated on todays hardware.   This is speculated to be 10000tx/s with more code optimisation...  So yes.


Please don't twist my words.   You have been FUDed by people who do not want bitcoin to scale freely (as opposed to a way they can control and co-opt).
Other coins will prove it .... so, you will see eventually I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:29:15

Why not next block?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:02:07


I think the whole "bitcion thing", is a little too important just to lay down  ;)


There is no boss in bitcoin.... You can fork the network, and if the ecconomic incentives support it (ie. if nodes mine it), then go forth and prosper.
Which is exactly what happened.    People seem to be salty that it happened (calling it a scam) ....  Personally, I'm extremely salty that it took as long as it did to happen.




Indeed.   Fees rose by 10x in the space of 1 week just recently.

Xthin is the main development (cos the main restriction is network bandwidth and block propagation) .... and not to mention that paper was debunked pretty hard in general.
Large block test have actually run the blocks, and found it's nowhere near as bad.
Unless those nodes are literally running on a raspberry pi and terrible internet, then they could run 8M blocks
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:37:03


Who else do you think is?... Aside from the developers and miners...  and the miners got played, so the "owner" is the developers.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:14:14


Absolutely correct.
You can do 3000 tx/s + on todays hardware which is reasonably trivial for a miner or large merchant to accept.
The fact that there is not be block size increases to accomodate the current transaction volume is so far gone past stupid that BTC has already failed.


That remains to be seen... but some sort of micropayment solution will likely be required yes.


None of this requires a restricted block size, right now.


Why?  Why?  Why?    Sure, you should not let the compute/network become a *problem*, but otherwise what you are saying complete bullshit.
Right now you can do GIANT blocks on a garden variety multicore CPU, with an 8TB HDD, and a few mbps of reliable internet.


This will always be the case.  Mining is competitive - there truckloads of other ways it can be optimized too.   Sounds like you've been mislead by the ASICBoost scare, it doesn't work that great IMHO if you read the literature.


But, that's exactly how crypto-ecconomics is *supposed* to work.  Those who invest the most money, have the most say.


Why?  Full blocks is a bug, with an easy solution.   We're not at the point of needing completely uncapped blocks, but just even an 8MB block size would be harmless, and remove the pressure.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:50:06


Who is it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:51:22


... heh, but everyone is going to have to activate segwit anyways  ;)
They should have implemented segwit as a hard fork, to give people the choice (of a chain without segwit) .... but that would have demonstrated who actually wanted segwit.


Yes, sure.... but it's like this:
All legacy nodes reject large blocks -&gt; Bitcoin Cash
All legacy nodes accept segwit blocks -&gt; Bitcoin
If people want to know which one of these is more like the Bitcoin that existed before it was broken on purpose (high fees, long waits, replace fee) .... I will tell them Bitcoin Cash is more like it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:31:23


They really do have the control.


This is correct, but not the point.


The users don't have any true ability to control what the miners or developers do.    Ultimately the MINERS are in control, and the ecconomic incentives are designed to ensure that nodes (mining nodes) behave in the interests of the network
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:55


As long as there are -enough- independent nodes which behave honestly, then bitcoin works.
So it IS an issue (you can't neglect decentralisation) .... but arguing for the opposite (everyone run a node), isn't the solution.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:56:00
There are other versions of the video which are up, which have comments.   There are also quite a few threads about it, when you can discuss.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:57:19


I think you misunderstand how consensus in bitcoin *actually* works.  It works via hashpower.    Nodes will do what is in the networks best interest due to ecconomic incentives.


The fact the BCH chain is not dead, means there is consensus that it is valid (enough hash power supports it for it not to die).
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:03:21
Sure... I didn't mean BTC changed the 'consensus' rules ... just that they changed the rules to add segwit.
Segwit should have just been implemented as a hard fork ... so there were two competing chains (giving people who didn't want segwit a defined choice) ....  but they were too smart for that and played everyone, twisting it in to a 'user activated soft fork', which sounds wonderful and nice to the sheeple.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:14


They can decide ... but they will be forked by the mining nodes.   Only nodes which compete to create a chain are providing any form of effective security.


Segwit is just a convoluted and poor form a block size increase.... they would have been a million times better to just go to 2 or 4M blocks ... which is why I think we will see support develop for the chain which has done that
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:16:32


For good reason.   Segwit is poison....  Blocks large enough to hold the transactions is what everyone wanted (hence 'clamoring for 2x')

Consensus = hash power.
If there is enough hash power to keep your chain alive.   So BCH is an "upgrade to bitcoin".      Bitcoin Cash is an upgrade to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:19:58
Segwit, replacebyfee, full blocks - these all seriously compromise the security model of bitcoin for various reasons.


Fees don't need to be high to satisfy the ecconomic incentives for nodes to behave.   If they do, can you point me to some analysis which demonstrates so?!   I'll wait.


Perhaps.   That remains to be seen.   Analysis of LN shows you will clearly be pushed off chain.   That is not bitcoin.


I am very worried about my investments, and my own gains aside I think bitcoin is quite important.   You don't play "chill out, eveything is going to be fine" with something like this, when all the well reasoned information says otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:18:43
The only nodes which truly matter are the ones which are mining.
If there are enough honestly behaving mining nodes, then other people running nodes don't help the security of the network.
If there are NOT enough honestly behaving mining nodes, then other running nodes DOES serve a use case .... but the problem is that the economic incentives of bitcoin are already broken, and it is extremely very unlikely that we could just "fire those evil miners" and get on with things.
People don't like this fact ....   but the operation of a node in the context of even a small mining operation is a small expense.   This makes people feel powerless to the prospect of miner collusion....  I suspect a very big part of it is not appreciating the game theory of the blockchain.
Running your own node won't protect you from the 'evil miners'.
... but I do agree with the sentiment that many people can afford to (and will) run a node - and I think it's not a bad thing too... and I think people drastically over estimate how difficult a larger block node (say 8M?) is to run, and drastically underestimate Moore's law.

The blocks are full because they are too small for the number of transactions.    I'd like bigger blocks rather than less transactions.


....Ummmm.  Right.  Did you accidentally buy one of those lobotomies you are selling?!   ;)


Correct, but when transactions remain unconfirmed for so long (long queues), then it becomes a trivial attack vector.

There was no network security problem prior to drastic rises in fees.


Miners = nodes  (or the node(s) your pool runs if you mine in a pool) ..... Nodes which don't mine, do nothing.
So you are saying there is no economic incentive for miners to exist.    Perhaps you have been tricked into the dogma that all users need "to run their own node".     That is complete BS FUD.

@_date: 2017-12-15 05:30:51


You misunderstand how this works.   Anyone can fork any block chain.  Consensus is measured by whether they have enough hashpower (and hashpower supported by ecconomic incentives).
The fact that BCH is alive, is proof that it DID gain this consensus.
On the other hand... a "soft" fork, is more devious.   There is no "choice", because there is no competing chain to follow.   If you adopted segwit, you were on BTC.  If you didn't adopt segwit, you were on BTC  (unless you do your own hardfork to create a new chain).
All the people who didn't want segwit were given no choice.   Miner were 'bought' by the promise of finally a block size increase - and they got stooged...   but they're not going to just "jump" idealogically.  Miners follow the ecconomic incentives, which as expected are currently split between BTC and BCH appromiately by the price ratio.


Miners should follow the ecconomic incentives .... but ultimately, they have the ultimate power.  They are the ones which put blocks on the chain.   They could change the software and fork, if they wanted.
Consensus is hashpower ... which is driven by the ecconmic incentives.    You can see that in action on November 12 (the clear consensus for both chains - when the ecconomics allow)

Large scaling solutions (whether on or off chain - the future is difficult to predict) will be needed long term, but for the coming years, I don't agree with what I've quoted.
The thing preventing bitcoin from being electronic cash, is **full blocks** (high fees, lack of zero conf safety, and lack of next block confirmation).   Larger blocks are the solution to this.
If you want to say that this then excludes certain miners from participating, then please provide more detail to support that.   As far as I understand it (I am a miner), it is false.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:40:54


Indeed....  but a miner will never do this, becuase he knows it will trivially fail....  the don't need extremely high numbers of nodes to protect against this (ie. we have enough nodes now).
If enough mining power colludes .... ie.  the majority of mining-nodes are no longer behaving honestly .... then what?
The honestly behaving (non-mining) nodes, have essentially forked themselves off "the network".
... we will know there is a problem ... and with the minority (honest) hashpower, the full nodes will be able to continue (but not those with SPV, ie. almost everybody).
In that situation, bitcoin is broken ... and the real question is how did the economic incentives (which protect against the majority of mining nodes behaving dishonestly) fail .... the bitcoin security model revolves around this game theory.


I clearly disagree.   ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:20:01


By what measure?   Why do you say there is a lack of nodes?  What is the effect?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:00:48


1)   Firstly, segwit is a solution to a problem which doesn't exist:
* Tx malleability is not a significant problem.  Tx malleability actually has future use cases (smart contracts, etc.)
* Tx malleability fix is not -required- for "layer 2" solutions ... only it makes the implementation of lightning network (and similar) possible/easier.   Note - lightning networks is a poor design anyways.
* Block congestion, does not need segwit ... it just needs a bigger block.   Example, just fork to 2M or 4M blocks.   Scaling problems (at least between now and 1000s of tx/s) are fiction.
2) Segwit, redefines the escence of what a bitcoin IS.   It means that the most basic premise in the whitepaper is no longer true


This is no longer true with segwit.   0_o
* Not having signatures as part of the transaction changes both the security (both technical and ecconomic) of bitcion.
Here is a presentation, which covers the detail: 
3) Once we start making segwit transactions .... it will be extremely damaging to remove segwit from the bitcoin code.   It is essentially inoperable cancer.   This is tghe exact reason why Bitcoin Cash needed to fork when they did (before segwit was activated) - so they could avoid any 'unremovable' segwit transactions
4) Consensus for segwit, was extremely flawed - it broke the consesnus model of bitcoin, that involves mining nodes acting in the best interests of the network.
Because it was delivered as a "soft fork", there was essentially no choice.   Miners did *not* get the option to say, "OK I don't agree with this change - I will continue to mine the chain which doesn't include the change" .... becuase there was no *other* chain.
The "compromise" made to get miners to "keep quiert" about their segwit concerns.   A fork to 2M blocks....   well, we all know what happened to that.
It's all been a complete sham.

You misunderstand trust (ie. you can have trustlessness, without your own node)
Doesn't improve privacy
Your node does not relay tx fast enough (therefore REDUCES the solution to the double spend attack)


It does not effectively do this if you are not adding blocks.
@_date: 2019-06-09 06:28:08
\&gt;the beauty of running you own full node....
When you run a bitcoin node, you still have to download (and upgrade) software, so you can still be scammed in the same way.
Users should run SPV wallets, not nodes.   You just need to ensure you download known-good software, unlike the person here.
@_date: 2019-06-08 04:11:37


No, I am not.    You can broadcast your tx in other ways, and have the same level of trustlessness than if you ran your own node.   The idea that when you are running your own node (which doesn't find blocks) means you need to trust block finding nodes less, if completely false.
However, the way bitcoin solves the double-spending problem, requires highly connected nodes.  Loosely connected nodes (ones that do not broadcast tx quickly) decrease the security of the network.
You only need to model/game how these things work - and it is obvious.
@_date: 2019-06-09 08:41:14


Exactly, so it's up to them how they use it.   If they are happy with the extra cost (or their customers are) then, so be it.


Yes, what I mean is that other people have very different opinions about batching tx, and about segwit.


If coinbase want to pay for their tx (or ask their customers to pay) .... then this is their right to do that.
You can jump up and down, and say they're "doing the wrong thing" (by cluttering up the blockchain), but they're the ones paying for it.... and everybody else has no say in the matter.
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:43:55


That's correct...   (I took the question to be slightly different).
Yes, you will need to confirm the tx you are interested in is in a block.    Which you can do, with out explicitly trusting a node.   All you need to do is confirm the merkle root .... and you can do this on multiple nodes if you want to.
It is impossible that many nodes lie to you ... unless the network is under majority attack, and in THAT case, running a node is of no effective help to you either (contrary to some people's belief).


So which is it?   "You can't" .... or you don't know?   (Hint:  Yes, you can)


Well, that mean you are completely clueless.    You can confirm the merkle path, which will confirm to you (cryptographically) that the tx is in the block.


If that was correct then bitcoin would be a comically flawed design, which nobody would be interested in.


Try here:
@_date: 2019-06-09 10:41:34
I don't agree.
Coinbase not implementing segwit or lightning, doesn't quality as "not a good look".  I would expect they have no intention of implementing these things (there's very good reason for them to not).
As for batched tx.... Coinbase can structure their tx however they want....  I would assume it hasn't been sending them broke (as they didn't do anything sooner).

SURE it did.   It's called Bitcoin Cash.    People didn't want segwit (or the continued delay on the block size problem), so they created Bitcoin Cash.
They had to do it when they did, becuase once anyone starts to use sewit addresses then it's very difficult to remove .... so they needed to fork before segwit activated.

\&gt;When you connect a light wallet to someone else's node, they know what all of your transactions are.
This doesn't *have* to be the case (although it is for many current wallet implementations).   **It is possible** to broadcast tx in way which does not identify you.
@_date: 2019-06-09 07:54:40


In your opinion, sure....  but they owe you nothing, and so all you can do is use a different service provider.
Nothing about the bitcoin design says they *should* batch transactions.  It's either losing *them* money, or their customers....  which either way, is none of my business.   Paid transactions are not "spam".
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:01:36


Because you are in possession of the private keys to your UTXOs.    You do not need to ask other nodes to tell you about things which you are in possession of.


Yes, but you do not have to trust their reply.   You can verify it with another node if you want.


The whole POINT of bitcoin is that when you ask the network to tell you about the blockchain, that you do not need to trust the response you get.   You can confirm cryptographically that it is correct, and/or you can verify by asking someone else.
Running your own node gains you nothing (except costs you money), and is detrimental to the bitcoin network security.  These things seem very controversial to people who have been "taught" the opposite.
People will say "but what about X, or Y" ...  Yes, in *every* situation.

People talk about Bcash like it's "impure", but to my understanding the blocksize (and increases) were discussed heavily by Satoshi .... where as Segwit, and L2 wasn't.     So how is it that BTC wasn't the one which "forked away"?
I also read other info pointing out how very bad the Segwit implementation is - and that once segwit transactions are used (with spend-any type outputs, sorry if I have that terminology wrong), then it's not possible to remove it.

I can kinda see why people are switching over.  I know there's a lot of dissent about 'how' things were done, and who is pushing what agenda  (everyone's out for themselves really, that's natural)
... what have I missed?!  :-/

But I don't understand why transaction malleability is even an problem that needs to be fixed.
Meanwhile segwit completely redefines the heart of what a bitcoin is.... from a chain of signatures .... to NOT a chain to signatures.   It's totally ridiculous.


Sounds plausible.


But zeroconf is safe, right? ... so why required?
Right now.... I think LN is either stalling tactic vapourware ... or if it eventuates a play to centralise (mesh) the network into something which can be controlled.


... but there are much better in-the-wild anon solutions than a "L2" type network, right.    Giving up all the freedom of a blockchain for "L2 which provides anon" seems shortsighted.

Many people completely misunderstand it .... mainly because they misunderstand what power miners have, and what "running your own node" achieves (or doesn't achieve).
Bitcoin is about decentralisation of power.... which means I am not forced to trust anybody.
Centralising power, leads to "people I have to trust".

Yes, of course .... but assuming no collusion with miners, then the transaction is not going to be undone.
Replace by fee means it can be undone, and means 0-conf can never be trusted.


Yes, that's right... but who wants a network topology which can be censored so easily.   It is so completely different from how the network of bitcoin nodes is arranged ....  all the things which can become possible becuase I can transact with anyone without censorship are no longer guaranteed in a "L2 mesh" future.


You can double spend (change a transaction).   Just that UI doesn't facilitate it. 
It replaces the "first seen" wins, with the "highest fee" wins.


Users don't need to run nodes.... as long as their enough nodes with enough diversity, there's no need to limit the network to something that can be run by users.


1GB (!) blocks work on reasonably attainable hardware available today... so the bitcoin network can scale to much larger than it needs to be today, MUCH .... all current proposals for "layers" take away everything good about bitcoin.   Future "layer" proposals might not, and that would be good.
For now, anyone "Waiting for lightning" (or similar) has been duped.

Discussion I was reading about the testing going on now, talked about 30mbps bandwidth being used.


... but doesn't the hub have to be very large, in order to be likely enough to be able to connect the two people who want to transact.


Why are the costs higher?


It doesn't seem like there are drastic negative consequences for huge blocks, even with the technology of now.   (!?!?)

Bcash was a hard-fork. It was a split.
Ah, but that's the ruse.   Once we start using segwit addresses it is basically impossible to go back.
The semantics between hard and soft fork don't really help here.... they're both new rules .... it's just how they needed to be implemented (all upgrade at the same time, vs not all at once)

No.  I mean what are you doing to fix all of the attack surfaces in the node software you run?   How many software developer hours are you throwing at making sure it is secure?   If you are not doing this, then why should I connect to your node?  Why should I trust your node?
Nodes will get hacked....  ones which are not improved will die.    This is the competition which drives bitcoin.  It's like evolution....  Different players will take various amounts of "risk", at the risk of being "out competed".
Nodes will out compete you for connections, or for finding blocks, or for providing services.   Unless you are offering something which is valued by others you are redundant.
It's the game of life.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:09:03


It isn't a "takeover" as such .... it's just as the OP said, it's just the economic incentive arrangement which drives bitcoin forward, working as intended.   That being that the miners mine in their own interest, and that coincides with that is best for the network.

Nodes which do not participate in finding blocks will do very little in practise to prevent what you are describing.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:08:37


You are right about ***that***.
\&gt;They do not compete for connections
Of course they do..... bitcoin network is competition of who can be the most highly connected.
\&gt;or blocks
Nodes **signal** their validation of the chain by attempting to build a new block on the chain.    If your node just *rejects* transactions and block... but *does* nothing  (ie. does not attempt to built a competing chain ..... then you are just "screaming at the sky that you do not like what's on television tonight".   You're achieving *nothing*.
\&gt;nor for anything else
They compete to be the most efficient, the most secure, the highest performing ..... for if they do not do these things, they will eventually be out competed by others .... who become more highly connected, and more able to validate the chain by building new blocks on top of it.
\&gt;And neither do they provide services
They do not now .... but they *will*.   Double spend detection.... transmitting old blocks.... SPV ..... the list will be *endless.*
\&gt;nor do they care who (and how many) connects to it exactly 
Perhaps *you* don't care *who* connects to your node (or who *you* connect to) .... but anyone trying to win the game of blocks .... or who would try to offer a service to others (eg. merchants who want to know their transactions are broadcast, mined, etc.) ..... is going to need to care which and how many nodes they connect to in order to do better at these things than others.
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:50:44




The whole *point* of bitcoin is that you **do not need to run a node** to interact with the network in a trustless manner. If you do not understand how this is possible, then you do not have a fully formed understanding of bitcoin.


A "bunch of things" eh?! I simply described *how nodes work ....* and what other purposes they can potentially serve if they choose not to validate at the tip of the chain.

I have run DNS infrastructure for a large ISP...  Compared to running a participating bitcoin node (ie. one which competes to find and broadcast blocks) .... DNS is trivial.
\&gt;Once people think that running a full node is as important and as easy as running a modem
... but once you understand how the networks you will realise that these nodes are not effective.   They don't *do* anything.

I'm talking about nodes ... That's all there is, nodes.
Nodes validate the chain.   How?   They validate the chain by choosing to add blocks to it .... so that chain grows longer than the chain(s) they're choosing not to add blocks to.
Nodes relay transactions and blocks which they consider valid to other nodes.... and so you might say you are doing your bit by "validating".
.... but read that again.   You **don't** relay invalid transactions and blocks.
So, when something is wrong, what you do, is you **do nothing.**....  but the blockchain continues to grow without you (potentially including those things you called invalid).   
What you actually needed to do to participate in the network *validation* is to work to add new blocks to the valid chain.... to out compete the invalid chain(s).
Nodes which do not mine can do useful things though.     They can offer "services" to others .... send them old blocks, be a host for SPV users, relay important transactions (eg. for merchants - who have a stake in confirming their transaction got committed)  ..... but to do this at any scale, and at any importance .... they will need to *compete.*   Compete to be better connected (so they broadcast their transaction to important nodes quickly.... or detect double spend attempts quickly, etc.) .... or be more secure (so they don't get hacked) .... or be more efficient  (so they're simple and cheap to run), etc. etc.
At scale, nodes that do these things (eg. SPV host, double spend detectors, etc. etc.) will be important.   They also won't necessarily be free (nothing is truly), which is where nodes "being services" come into it  .... so if I am going to pay nanocents to listen to a node, why would I want to hear about the blockchain from your shitty node that is slow to respond to me, hears about the state of the chain later than others, and is probably hacked.... Nobody will pay you any attention.

There is no difference when we are talking about "operating the network".   Nodes which don't add blocks are "information only" - they do very little.


Indeed.   Although nodes can choose which other nodes they connect to .... which is very very powerful when you think about it (and a big part of what I think you are missing).


No, it won't be....  which indicates you don't understand how the security works (you seem to be focussed on hashpower, like most people - there's a lot more to it than this).
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:57:14


Seem like you don't understand how it works... it is not the latency of blocks, but of tx.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:37:38


Contrary to popular belief this is not how bitcoin is designed to (or will) work.   There are two reasons.
The security of the network nodes depends on the network latency of transactions (and blocks) transmission between nodes.    Things at your house, or in your pocket, are too "far away" from the core of the network - they are too slow.
The performance of a dedicated "purpose designed" node hardware .... will always be vastly (!!!!) higher than what embedded computers can do.   This means it will always be both uneconomical ***and*** ineffective to try to put "hashrate in your refrigerator".

*Ultimately,* the reason why miners will not do this is that it would reduce usage of bitcoin which will reduce their profits.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:47:27


whatever the miner wants
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:21:32


No.  Latency between nodes does not affect that.
Latency between nodes affects transaction propagation times, which affects the 'security' of the bitcoin network against double spending.
The double spending problem is dramatically improved when a broadcast transaction gets into a very high number of mempools in a very short amount of time.
Nodes which receive a transaction "late", are the attack vector for my double-spending.


It is what *will* happen.   Right now, tx volumes are very very low... and block sizes are very very small....  hashrate is the dominant thing you need to win a block reward.
As block sizes and transaction volumes increase nodes will be forced to improve their connectivity to be able to transmit the vast number of tx and block sizes.   They will HAVE to do this to ensure they win the block reward (or they will lose profit).
