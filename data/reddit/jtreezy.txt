Bitcoin is the worst investment ever if you think of it as that you'll just be disappointed when all of your money is gone. Just hold on to it tho, Dont make the mistake of trying to"daytrade" is like I did. It's fun like gambling is fun but leads to an empty bitcoin wallet. But in general i'd say bitcoin isnt ever going past 700 again.

As an opportunity to make fast money off of? Absolutely. As a technology? No, not yet. But the coin itself will be replaced by  a better one soon enough. By the time the world is ready for bitcoin, bitcoin will be so old it would have been replaced by something superior, but based on the original protocol. That's just my opinion.

People just get mad when someone says anything bad about bitcoin because they have money in it and are so desperate they think negative reddit comments will make the price go down.

It drops so easily with good news all over the place, imagine how easily it will fall when governments start to regulate it even more

Bitcoin is so last year, just pull all of your money out and that will solve everything. Oh wait, let me guess, your down so you dont want to. You'll never be up. Face it.
