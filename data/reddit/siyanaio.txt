I suppose that’s true.... without detailing the structure of those 12 districts. But you are certainly correct on people not paying attention. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, and who sat on the board of the New York Fed, most powerful of the 12, would certainly agree with your assessment. Especially when the Fed acquired the ability to pay interest to its member banks on the reserves the banks maintain at the Fed. 10/3/08.  Treasury (funded by taxpayers) paying interest on the amount of reserves held by member banks, to those very same banks.... no evidence of self-interest or centralized actions to see there, let’s move focus to how the 12 banks are structured, going back to your argument. The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation’s central banking system, are organized much like private corporations. For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year. But don’t forget the interest paid on reserves, guaranteed 10% from taxpayers.... so I’m interested to hear more about this whole decentralized 12 district federal reserve system you had just referenced?

I agree with the seedy gas station, but certainly a few high end kiosks. Listen, don't misinterpret my video for youth, let's just say my first online experiences were on a 56k dial up. (Sure we are on the same page) I think you are really going to regret discounting this industry, and the minds of these participants in something, if we were honest with ourselves.., should've been emphasized greater in later generations. We were the generation that got misled by the generation before us, with promises they were led to believe has any value. We were the naive ones. Yeah, being young is difficult, but not every young person acts the same. Their generation is seeing the hardships and experiencing them first hand. I would try to remember, it's usually the person who attacks the competence of others, who he himself is protecting his own ego. It's about time we stop separating ourselves and focus on those who are really acting without any kind of insight.

It is hard to not admit the controversial legacy of his politics and personal beliefs. There is much to detract from just how ‘pure’ this man really was, or what motivated his actions against the banks. But the ideas do hold true today, whether to protect his own political interests or for a higher ideal. To centralize the power to issue currency into the hands of a few stakeholders gives them enormous power and influence. Since decentralized crypto was neither available or in existence, the best alternative was keeping those powers with an elected government, who if doing their due diligence, represented the will of the people, the only form of decentralized authority available at that time.

While you’re correct in the further motivations of Jackson against his opponents, he was outspoken regarding the idea of currency issued by non governmental entities, in direct violation of the constitution. ‘But if they have other power to regulate the currency, it was conferred to be exercised by themselves, and not to be transferred to a corporation.’

I realize I should've wrote more in the title to emphasize the topic in that direction, but the Bitcoin symbol, separated from currency symbols, was pretty obvious I wasn't referencing trade tensions alone.

I really appreciate the members and community here on the Bitcoin thread, and I even understand the role of the moderators. Reddit was always my go to, because there are members with real understanding of the industry. But this emphasis on specific requirements for posts and flagging topics that have a real impact on Bitcoin is really distracting.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:54:07
Wow... Was hoping there was a few programmers amongst those here. So based on those rules, my post was compliant, just a matter of syntax. So based on your requirements, does Bitcoin have to be Capitalized, is it case-sensitive? Can I use Italics or Bold fonts?
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:07:06
My point exactly
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:04:52
Not whining, btw. Idk why this was even an issue in the first place, the comments were specifically focused on how this effects Bitcoin. Not whether I wanted to import socks from Taiwan. I didn't raise the issues,  I wanted to focus on Bitcoin and the impact. So did people discussing the news on the thread.

Bitcoin a global asset, as well as a nascent technological advancement. How can you talk about the dollar without talking about finance, how can you talk about the technical requirements of a Data Center, without talking about Data Privacy and the regulations surrounded it. That argument doesnt make any sense....

This is not about rich vs poor. Currency is a measure of the value you offer to the world, it is not the value in itself. Valuable skills and assets in the old system, will be valuable here. But unlike the old system, your measure of value doesn’t depreciate by manipulating the currency supply, your measure of value cannot be confiscated, your measure of value is under your ownership. It’s the beginning, yes, I agree there are issues. But it gets better, not worse as it progresses. Decentralized exchanges, second layer chains, scaling, better distribution algorithms, atomic swaps, etc will remove the problems that allow manipulation and hoarding. But can you honestly say, it was better before Satoshi proved another direction was possible?

Didn’t misunderstand at all. I am human, I understand. When I still occasionally feel frustration watching a small number of people accumulating so much power and influence over the world and say WTF. When I first got involved I had a sense of disappointment that those who held such wealth were inconsiderate and greedy. Each day I realize how inconsiderate and greedy it is for me to think that way. If I offer a million dollar value to this world, it’s not the million paper dollars I hope for... it is the recognition for my contribution. If another contributor offers more, shouldn’t he/she expect it too? Should I garner more for less? Even if it was non-monetary, would you accept working your whole life for a cause, and forget even the recognition, expect a completely unassociated person be invited to witness the success and not even have the opportunity to confirm whether it was a success or not?  Look at the trend in both monetary systems. In fiat, control is increasingly concentrated to fewer and fewer participants. In crypto, with more innovation, just because the former system transitioned to the new, where few controlled the bulk of wealth, at the very least those factors are being challenged, but not at the expense of whatever value they create, just to more accurately measure through out the system. Contributors like Steve Jobs, Bezos and Musk do not lose their significance, but are not overvalued because they cannot manipulate the foundations of the system itself. They might be able to influence or gain unfair benefits, but not change the underlying rules of participation.

As a consumer, I guess. As a business owner, that's loss of revenue, profit margin, employment may need to be reduced. Jobless numbers go up, consumer sentiment goes down. You might not work directly for a company dealing with Chinese imports, but revenue across industries take a hit. Less money working in the economy. It's a timing issue, the US is 21 Trillion in debt. Debt doesn't mean much to those of us with modest means, but it does to those who hire, have more to lose. We get hit with harder means of getting income.

Where to begin? ... I'll just give you one many (seriously many), this one being directly related, if you are importing goods from China, and you are being hit with a 25% increase in your costs to import those products. You are not going to sit on your hands and lose revenue. Some will use proxies from countries without Tariff restrictions, but they still will need to transact with China. Now BTC holds a stronger position than the dollar as these businesses conduct international trade. There are businesses who understand how zato work around embargos and trade sanctions.
I didn't even mention the snowball effect an extended trade war would have on the US economic stability and purchasing power of the US $, especially with businesses who cannot execute or risk sidestepping the new tarriffs. Not to mention the monetary policies that have been manipulating inflation numbers for decades, will now have limited capabilities without cheap imports to rely on. Housing, Energy and Food stuff have risen consistently throughout the years.  An escalating trade war will pump those prices with steroids, while increasing everyday purchases. High inflation, strong dollar, triggering a cash shortage and recession. Fed will print Fiat, to the point of hyper-deflation, weakening the dollar. And our debt based Fiat system collapses. 
Just throwing a few out there... No relationship from what I see.....��

$386 Billion dollar debt payments on interest alone. Do you honestly believe that is sustainable? You’re right, debt is healthy, but not at these levels. The health of US currency and the global economy hinges on the ability of the government to satisfy each and every payment made on its obligations. One missed payment puts into question the value of the country’s debt backed currency. What happens when the government is not able to secure enough tax revenue to make its required payments on debt, what happens when politicians fail to gather enough votes each time to approve those payments, what happens when there is a significant economic slowdown? 
China, Japan, Ireland and Brazil are the largest holders of US debt. There is already evidence that China applies significant pressure on the countries indebted who are having issues maintaining their obligations to that debt. Which country’s currency will be trusted if the US dollar loses significant value?

First two are growing their infrastructure and are not nearly at the scale or development stage of China's operations. Japan was the second biggest economy in the world, and is still a powerhouse, but an aging population and significant difference in scale can't be ignored.  You are comparing capabilities of small regional nations with limited natural resources, to the sleeping Giant.  There are reasons certain geographical regions around China are considered geopolitical hotspots, Taiwan, etc. Each area offers both economic, regional infrastructure of specific interest to the mainland. Hong Kong as a financial and international trading hub, which helped develop Shenzen... The semiconductor and silicone infrastructure of Taiwan, the rare earth mineral deposits and mines in Mongolia, etc. Kind of funny how we are always fed the same story about how these small local places, show interest in democracy and against communism....�� So they need our protection, they are valuable to both our interests and the interests of China, there is a real economic value, that has nothing to do with political ideology.

You're right, actually as per Tim Cook of Apple, China hasn't been cheap for sometime in terms of basic manufacturing. But that's not their advantage, its the number of skilled vocational workers. He explains it with two manufacturing regions, one in the US and one in China, of the same size, where the number of specialty toolists  in the US region could fill a small room, where the Chinese could fill a football field. I have personally been to Shenzen, their factories are not specific to one set of products, they can reverse reengineer existing products and be ready for build in weeks, where in the US or other countries it might take months or maybe years to  modify deployment. It's not just about cheap labor or materials, it's the production capabilities, what are you getting from moving operations. It's not as simple as you make it out to be, 
China is dealing with a slowing economy, this is a global issue not just a US issue. For the past decade, Fiat currencies have been in decline. It's more about the monetary policies of nation states, not just trade. This is a natural evolution, the downturn is just the pin that pops the bubble. Globally, states don't want to rely on any country's currency for trade. Too much centralized power, that's where Bitcoin fits in.
