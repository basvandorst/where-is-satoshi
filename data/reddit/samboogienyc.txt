Good point, so in an authoritarian country if people were shut off from internet access it would obviously hurt their ability to get their money.

Nice use of stats- it would indeed be pretty hard to get your hands on that kind of power... Not sure what kind of attacks could be done- perhaps price manipulation? I'm sure there are already people playing that game.

Got my first wallet yesterday. Known about Bitcoin since 2011 and didn't get in, stupid in hindsight but I'm here now and pretty excited about that. It's an amazing concept.

Good job OP - BTC is the bees knees... What is your major at Hunter? I went there for Economics and dropped out. I'm considering re-applying for Computer Science, it'd be nice to know if it's a good program though.

Thanks! First deposit!

good point - probably because I suck at reddit? I'll keep that in mind next time.

thanks for your detailed response.

I've known about Bitcoin for a few years now- when I saw that it's being 'investigated' I knew I had to get off the sidelines. Created my first wallet yesterday woohoo!

this is freshhh. I used to buy regular ATM's and make $ off of them but the business was saturated and nepotistic. I might have to be one of the first to bring one of these baby's to NY.
