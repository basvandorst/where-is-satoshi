I'm not so sure. Other people's expectations about the price are based on the assumption that other coins are alive in the marketplace. If those coins are not, their own coins have a different value.

How do you know there are less coins? This is my point, it's undefinable.

You are correct that there is less supply, but by how much? If someone loses a wallet with 1,000,000 btc, that would surely effect the market value, but absolutely nobody would know. Everybody would assume those coins are still out there. But they are not.

The common consensus on this sub seems to be "lost coins will drive the price up."

You are saying value is determined by supply and demand but if supply changes value is unaffected???
*This* makes no sense.

Can each coin which hasn't been moved within say 3 years be considered dead?
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:29:14
Exactly. It is expected that these coins are still out there. But what if they are not? What if they are, as you say, dead? Does that have an effect?

Hmm... eloquently put. I didn't think about the market being responsive only to what is being put up at that moment. Makes much more sense that way. I was thinking of the terms I see often posted about that "lost coins drive value up" in a timeline disconnected from the immediate. Therefore having an effect at all times. Thanks!

Sure, makes sense. But let's say in your example of this $1 billion company, everyone believes there to be 1 billion shares. The price per share is $1. What if in actuality, there are only 1 million shares? The price should be $1,000 per share but it is not. It is $1. The price is the same but the value is different.
