The fact is that GHASH.IO does **NOT** have all that hashing power under it's direct control, but rather indirect control made up of individuals and large farms jointly directing the traffic to that pool.
Why is that important? Because it means we could implement a change to the mining software (that does not impact the core protocol or require a hard fork) that allows the individual contributors to perform realtime audits of how their hashing power is being used by a pool and automatically reject attempts to abuse the collective power.

It's a modern version of the **Animal Sentinel** used by miners back in the day to warn them if there was a dangerous gas leak or build-up that could kill them. Birds are way more sensitive than humans to toxins so they took canaries down the mines with them and if the bird died at some point they had a good idea there was an unseen danger and still had time to get out.
See: 
Today a **Warrant Canary** generally refers to a message placed in a public document by a company or at-risk group (such as a terms-and-conditions text) indicating words to the effect of *we have not received a confidential request for information from the government.* Since these requests usually force the companies to reveal the information they want but aren't allowed to let anyone know they have been asked for it - if they remove the words from the obscure text this acts as a "Canary" warning that they have received a request, without directly saying so - provided people regularly check to see if it is missing.
That said, the true legality of such a move is open to speculation - I'm not aware of anyone getting done for contempt yet but Judges are well known to have a low tolerance for legal tricks such as this.

I suggest before you get into any of the historical or technological aspects of what Bitcoin is that you spend a few minutes explaining "What is money?". It doesn't have to be an in-depth analysis, just a quick overview to show where value comes from as a concept and then segway into Bitcoin as an extension of that.
I find making that connection up front helps when explaining later on what Bitcoin is and how it functions.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:14:36
If true this strongly supports the theory that BTC belonging to customers was cashed out early on to support their image and lifestyle only to then be caught out when the price of BTC skyrocketed above USD $100 and beyond.
This would leave no alternative but to attempt to trade and arbitrage to replace the misappropriated coins which could account for the increasing delays we were seeing up until the end.

I could accept some degree of internal quality assurance testing before shipping to the customer but what you have described sounds pretty blatant. Was there any investigation and/or follow-up to this?
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:34:10
I've posted this elsewhere, but could it be possible Gox allowed certain "preferred" clients to hold BTC on their system in wallets they both shared the private keys for? That way they had access to the trading platform but retained the ability to independently move funds out if things went south.
This might explain some of the other activity we have been seeing recently as well.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:39:47
True, but a same end result if the theory is correct. If I bought 1 BTC a year ago at $30 and the money wasn't used to buy BTC at the time, when I go to cash it out 12 months later for $700 where is the extra $670 going to come from? It doesn't matter if I log in and my account says I have 1 BTC in my account, unless there is actual BTC backing it up there is nothing there to sell to pay me out at the current price.

As someone who got burned, and burned badly by delayed pre-orders I would sorely love to believe that they were running an "extended quality assurance" process with the ASICs we paid for.
Has there been any solid evidence such as blockchain analytics or insider leaks that could help prove this for us beyond reasonable doubt?

As other people here have speculated these are highly likely to belong to the estate of Hal Finney. He no doubt had some set aside for his long term care that ended up not being used and while I cannot speak for the family one would assume if they were not interested in continued involvement with Bitcoin the most logical course of action would be to liquidate them, most likely through an off-exchange deal given the amount involved.
I'm not saying we shouldn't ask questions about early transactions on the blockchain but if it turns out later this is the case let's respect their financial privacy once it's moved outside the blockchain - Hal gave so much to the community, it's the least we can do.
R.I.P. Hal.

That's what I heard as well, the staff involved were motivated and true believers but (allegedly) the owner absconded with the venture capital BTC they held. Heck, even Andreas Antonopolus /user/andreasma was burned by the incident for unpaid work he did to help them.
Since they have advertised a physical office and are local to me I'm willing to give them a chance. It's not unusual for companies to cherry pick the best parts of other companies when they go under, and from what I heard the Neo &amp; Bee backend was supposed to be pretty good.
Time will tell.

@_date: 2014-05-22 16:46:04
Quite valid points there.
It's true that geology relies on knowledge of past key events to delineate the era boundaries. But in the same way Bitcoin the protocol *does* allow us to look forward and identify what will be key events that will undoubtedly impact the overall system - that being the mining reward halving events. Perhaps they would be better boundaries of the time periods being referenced for historical purpose.
As to why do it now - it is easier to define these sort of things early on and have them carried forward into the wider acceptance as Bitcoin grows, rather than to try and define the standard later on when it has become spread far and wide.

Kindly explain how this is a massive loss to you?
If you bought into BTC 3 years ago and have been holding ever since then selling now is still going to net you a massive profit.

I know what you are saying but my counterpoint to this is what is more important? That my personal Bitcoin holdings rise in value or we ensure that the full 21 million of the coins are assured to come back into circulation at some point, one way or another?
@_date: 2015-05-11 02:27:00
Actually it shouldn't involve the minting of new coins. The only thing preventing the network from moving coins out of an existing address is the presence of a valid private key for the code to authorise it against. There is nothing stopping the code from being rewritten to ignore the private key in cases where [Age of Last Transaction] &gt; [99 Years] as an "approved" method of moving coins out of an inactive address. It just requires consensus, that is everyone to agree on the rule in their Bitcoin software for it to happen.
@_date: 2015-05-16 11:13:58
I did originally think the money transmission angle could have something to do with it, but the fact is that originally Bitcoin had *no* financial value and was merely an immutable token that could be exchanged on a public register. It was the public acceptance and use that turned it into a currency, that came after the fact.
@_date: 2017-02-09 03:50:06
There are already people doing it now but these early coins have significant additional standalone value now due to their historical significance. This has made them highly sought both to people in Bitcoin circles and also a number of collectors not involved with Bitcoin purely due to this. Even "spent" Casascius coins with no BTC remaining have a resale value but the holy grail is of course is a pristine, unopened coin with the hologram still intact.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:41:44

Good explanation, but what happens if the price of a PS4 suddenly shoots up to $9999 at the worst moment and I don't have the full $9699 difference to replace your console when you ask for it back?
I understand the concept of being forced to liquidate your holdings as the price climbs, but what happens if there is a sudden and massive correction before you are able to liquidate everything? Who gets left holding the bag??

Actually the biggest motivation for a hacker is to get away with what they are doing before it gets noticed. They want to profit, sure but they also want the recognition as well. Ideally they want to transfer and trade the stolen crypto as fast as possible to create as tangled a web as possible and make rollback effectively impossible.
The DAO hack was unique in that while the hacker was able to use an exploit to transfer the stolen ETH into a child DAO under their control it was still governed by the rules of the DAO which mandated a fixed period of time before the funds could be extracted. This bought the Ethereum Foundation time to implement a fork to recover the stolen ETH (though this has resulted in it's own set of political problems) but in the case of this recent hack the hacker had to exchange the funds as fast as possible before the source address was blocked by exchanges and flagged.

It would be epic if against the odds this historic server somehow managed to actually mine an actual block. Not sure of the probability (I sure someone could actually calculate the math for that) but it would be the ultimate underdog story if it ever did.

This is probably a number of the long-term holders unfreezing their cold storage and moving them into hot wallets. With Ethereum about to release it makes sense they are preparing to purchase significant quantities of Ether on release.

Wouldn't it be marvellous if Satoshi posted a signed goodwill message.
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:02:33
Hmm. Given the sheer number of coins potentially under one person's control I can understand the market concerns. That being the case, is there an argument to be made that during a future fork that Satoshi's coins should be somehow "reclaimed" and either destroyed or perhaps folded back into the mining process to be gradually redistributed over a long period of time. (and avoid crashing the market) I'm thinking in terms of ensuring market confidence, and surely one person having control of a significant chunk of BTC goes against the central ethos that Satoshi himself created Bitcoin as a counter to.
