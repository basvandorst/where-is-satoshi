Don't forget to deduct your costs for mining. Including your costs for Internet, rent or mortgage, electricity and costs associated with maintenance of your rig(s). You may also be able to deduct the loss of value or your mining rig.

Well quadriga charges 0.5% flat rate per trade. As for Japan, the reason I got into btc is because I want to move some money there for later use. However the idea of walking into the bank and getting bent over doesn't sit well with me. With the cad tanking it really was a good time to get into it. I know a bit about fx trading and so if I'm able to convert my cad to yen and make up a bit of the difference by trading, I'm a happy camper. Honestly if I knew more about the business I'd have a go at a remittance service between Vancouver and Japan. There's a working holiday program that brings a lot of young people back and forth and they have to change large sums of money.(support money from family or savings) There's many currency exchanges in the downtown but their rates are only slightly better than the bank.
As for Japanese exchanges, I can't read the kanji so I'm not sure what they're up to. But speaking of exchanges, will kraken ever allow cross currency trading?(ie usd/cad) Sometimes the spread it outrageous due to lack of volume, it'd be nice to be able to buy in any give currency.

It's worthless. Whoever filed it knows nothing about patents.

I could take about 10 seconds of listening to you talk. That's a full second longer than bitconnect shills. Congratulations!
