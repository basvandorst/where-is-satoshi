I maintain my BTC accounts in BTC.
When I change it back, I recognize it as a Capital Gain/Loss. Keep in mind that you have to declare capital gains (from currency exchange at least) above $200 on your taxes; and you only get the Capital Gains rate if you held on to it for more than a year.

Ah. Yes.
How you manage your inventory (LIFO, FIFO, average, whatever) is independent from the question of how you account for BTC.
You'd recognize the gain/loss at the point where it becomes inventory, and market value is probably as reasonable a way to do that as possible.
(Note that I'm not an accountant.)

Venezuelan-owned, but located in Palo Alto, California. (Near Stanford)
I was confused at first, too. (Even though I've been there; I thought it was weird that they'd have a coffee shop by the same name.)

Yeah, I'm the same. Newegg is a known quantity to me. I've been using them for years. I've even done will call for large orders, since I used to live next to their major west coast warehouse.
OTOH, I do live really close to bitcoinstore.com now.

They must have missed the second part "nor ask another man to live for mine"

Right, but is it using phones or something else?

You still need a way for the vendor to verify the sale, so there has to be *some sort of software* available to the cashier.

I was looking at hard drives. Here's an example, with prices as they are right now:
[Newegg]( ($184.99)
[Bitcoin Store]( ($186.22)
I forget which one I was looking at before, but the difference was like $5.

So, then the answer to my question would be "they have a laptop at the register with some kind of software".
As far as having just one address, that could potentially have problems with two people happening to order the same thing around the same time and only one paying with BTC. Then you need to have your cashiers trained in how to figure out which customer actually sent it.
In the end: You'll need some kind of software to handle BTC purchases at POS. I wanted to know what it is.

It's on Lawrence Expressway in San Jose. A *huge* number of tech workers drive that route every day.

How does this work? Are they partnering with someone?

Which is true in the US, too, if you make more than $600 profit on currency exchange in a year.

I poked around and checked some prices. NewEgg is still cheaper.
