It's the transfer of money into the market, or velocity. It's people buying bitcoins. People usually keep some cash liquid, but they thought the price would go up so they used some liquidity. When it was higher than people were comfortable with, the liquidity was withdrawn and went back to the average amount people are comfortable with. As more people enter the market and buy more, the price goes up and won't fall below a certain point for long because there will always be someone with a short position willing to buy it up.
That's at least how it is in a free market. Take something like wallstreet stocks or silver, and that's not the case, but there isn't any real manipulation in bitcoin because you can't make them up. When the price drops, there are people selling off massive quantities because it makes sense to them, not to fuck others over.

In the old days it was called "selling". If you sold at 147 and rebought at 115 you made a nice profit.

Is the payment center specific to the receipt? If not, I know where my local CVS is.

Large buying and selling in a free market is NOT manipulation, it's just what a free market is like. What we don't have to deal with is the *fraud* of buying and selling unbacked assets like in the silver market. Each bitcoin is real and "backed" by the security of knowing it's real and finite.
