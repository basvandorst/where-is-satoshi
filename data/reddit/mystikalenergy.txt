Getting error when trying to run gui.py
    File "C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\Python\util.py", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;
    import ecdsa
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ecdsa'
Okay so I did pip install ecdsa and PyQt5 as it asked me to do.
Now the gui just exit after I paste the URI and click on the Go! button.
URI format: bitcoin:?r= (bot is auto removes my comment)
