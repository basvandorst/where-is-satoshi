Great stuff in this comment.  It's worth pointing out, however, that Adam Back is in fact the guy who invented the proof of work system that Satoshi used in Bitcoin, so he's not just one of the new BTC philosophers.

And costly, and there's no financial incentive.  I really have a hard time seeing Bitcoin succeeding - as a distributed currency - if this problem isn't fixed.

Agree that it's both, but how will regulating it as currency be detrimental?  The property  classification had obvious downsides to merchants and consumers.  The currency classification will hurt government revenues - is that what you mean?

But I can do that already with stuff like Square cash, Paypal etc. Give me a specific example where I really need to use Bitcoin.  I'm really excited about the field, but am having a hard time seeing where the big differentiator for consumers is.
Google was huge because I needed to find things on the web, and it found things simpler and faster.  Facebook allowed me to see my friends' posts in a single place instead of visiting various blogs.
What's the killer app for Bitcoin?  Maybe it's not something that consumers need - maybe it's something in finance - but what is it?  I'd love to know.  Bullshit posts like this one don't help me, and frankly make me skeptical of the community.

People were saying the same thing about home and tulip prices at one point too.  I think that some form of cryptocurrency will be with us for a long time, but it won't be the one that fails to fix obvious flaws.

This still suffers from Tragedy of the Commons.  It stands to reason that in the long run, networks that provide incentives to the maintainers have an advantage.   
I'm still learning about Proof of Stake, but it seems to be a good candidate solution.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:36:39
Basing an economic system on the goodwill of activists isn't sustainable or scalable.  It's better we face these fundamental problems that explain them away.  If Bitcoin doesn't address these issues, it's is *doomed* to fail as a distributed currency.  
An interesting question is whether Bitcoin could adopt a Proof of Stake mechanic.  PoS is much more energy efficient and provides real financial incentives for nodes to stay connected to the network.  This seems like a more productive line of thought than burying our heads in the sand.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:04:15
I think voluntary donations are a dead end.  Alternatives that can get scale and provide an incentive are going to win.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:23:53
Yet, that's already happened for several alt coins, despite there being no incentive to do that.  The problem is taken pretty seriously by "Satoshi Nakamoto" in his various writings.  Having hash power in the hands of a small number of miners (even if 1 doesn't own the whole network) is *not a good thing*, since that leads to a few central points of failure.  Glibness about this problem won't inspire confidence in the larger community.  Cryptocurrencies that address it stand a much better chance in the long run.
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:16:48


I think that's incorrect.  Proof of Stake constantly inflates the coin supply (over infinite time, an infinite number of coins will be minted) .  PeerCoin has a 1% "interest rate", for example.  You'll have more coins at the end of the year, but so does everyone else. This means (all other things being equal) that the value of each coin actually *declines* over time.  However, everyone who participates in the PoS reward gets coins which offset the dilution.  It's like stock splits.  This does not incentivize people to hoard.
Furthermore, why worry about hoarding anyway? Other assets increase in value (bonds, for example), but we don't worry about people "hoarding" them.  People will always have needs, and will always need to spend.  
Investors store their wealth in an asset class that offers the right risk/return profile, and convert that wealth into a spendable form when they need it.  If a PoS coin increases in value, then keeping your wealth in PoS coins until you want to buy something is similar to  having a bank that gives you a high rate of return on your money.  On the other hand, if PoS coins decline in real value, then you'll do as you do now and keep most of your wealth in interest-bearing accounts or in stocks, and covert it into a spendable form later.
Finally, hoarding is balanced out by the fact that coins are only valuable to the degree that they are useful for something.  If no one ever spends coins, no one will provide a way to purchase goods with those coins.  If no one provides a way to purchase goods with the coins, their value will decrease.

[Proof of Stake]( ) might be a solution.  Does anyone have a sense of how feasible or impossible it would be for Bitcoin to include this method?

Way more than half of the time torrent links are broken, which is thanks to there being no financial incentive.  Financial systems don't run on warm and fuzzies.  They run on incentives, and a coin that provides this has a much better chance of success than one that doesn't.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:42:54


I'm pretty skeptical of this being a long term solution.  They're having fun now because there's novelty in it.  After the fun wears off, the ops guys will have every reason to eject these resource-eating processes from their systems.

I could find things that Lycos and Yahoo didn't find, and faster.   And what was happening was really a competition of several players trying to address a completely new market and need - internet search.  Google may have come a bit late, but it came early enough to win.  Bitcoin is not in an early-stage competition with monetary systems - they have been in use for thousands of years.  


I didn't - it's just that my friends were on Facebook and Facebook's growth team did a better job of building the network.  So I joined Facebook because of network effects. And again, this is really a competition of several companies addressing a new consumer need - most people were not using social networks when Facebook won over Myspace (and most still aren't).  Everybody already uses money and many use the internet for sending and receiving money quickly.
And when considering these competitors, the switching cost was nil.  For search, just type in google.com instead of lycos.com, or Facebook.com instead of myspace.com.  The switching cost of moving to Bitcoin is huge and scary.  What specifically is a consumer going to get for making this leap?


Because email was faster, free and accessible from ubiquitous computers.  No need to buy a stamp, no need to use a piece of paper, no need to wait for the paper to go through the fax machine, fewer errors.  
All of these examples you cite are "10x" improvements.  No social network -&gt; social network; no search-&gt;search.  Or they involve low switching costs (for the consumer) between a bunch of competitors in a relatively new field.  
I don't see what the *specific* benefit is for consumers.  How often do I send cash?  When I purchase things, it's just a click in Amazon, for instance.  For all intents and purposes, this is instantaneous.  Where is the benefit to using Bitcoin?  
I'm asking for a detailed use case analysis.  Better technology is not necessarily better.  What is a specific use case which walks through all the steps required to do something where Bitcoin is a 10x improvement?  How often does that behavior occur?  
If we have a 10x improvement in a frequent behavior, Bitcoin/the Blockchain will have its killer app, and we can safely lay aside criticisms that this is a tulip craze.  But that doesn't exist yet, IMO.
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:01:55


We're asking what is the real value of Bitcoin?  If lots of people will use it, it's valuable, otherwise, it's just a tulip craze.  You are a true believer  - maybe even an activist.  What *you* think doesn't matter.  What matters is what Joe consumer thinks.  If Bitcoin is useful to him, it will gain wide traction and be hugely valuable.  If not...

Can't find the tweets with Isabella Kaminska, so can only guess at your argument from what is posted here, which seems to be comparing the absolute numbers of the thefts to argue that fractional reserve is more risky.
But what do the absolute sizes of the thefts have to do with anything?
Euros in circulation = 956 Billion
Bitcoins in circulation = 3 Billion USD = 2.8 Billion Euro
**Stolen euros as a fraction of total in circulation**: 2B Euro /956B Euro = .2%
**Lost bitcoins as a fraction of total in circulation**: 5M  Euro/ 2.8B Euro = .17%

I assumed OP was arguing that the absolute values of these thefts tells us something about which currency is more secure.  *That* argument is pure bullshit, which the data I show above pretty conclusively demonstrate.
However, if you mean that OP has some *other* arguments, I might agree.  What are they?
