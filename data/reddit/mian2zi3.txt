Yes. They already don't where security is "important".  Companies already authenticate themselves to you using public/private keys (SSL certs).  MIT uses client side certs for authentication internally.  Basically every server on the internet is secured with RSA (ssh).

Guessing a password is an exploit.  Deciding to use passwords is a security architecture decision.  People keep saying this and it makes me furious.  Obviously a bunch of celebrities are at fault here, and not Apple (and basically everyone) for building systems where it is known many (a majority) of their users will make poor security decisions?  Bullshit.

Agreed.  Wouldn't transaction malleability be visible if someone were recorded all the transmitted transactions, even the ones that were rejected or didn't make it into the blockchain?  Surely someone was recording them.  Anyone?

This was a hoax.  The original link:

"Thread is close and hoaxed. The author admitted in a private exchange that the entire story was fabricated."

Amazing they're blaming this on a "bitcoin bug".  Can they take no responsibility?  There are a million controls that should have been in place to make this impossible.  It just doesn't add up.  The only thing that makes sense is they're trying to use transaction malleability to hide the fact they stole the coin.

Every time I look at coinbase, it sucks.  When you buy, you get the price when your bank transfer clears.  Who knows what the price is going to be in 4 days!  They added an instant feature, but they only support VISA non-debit cards (which is crazy since they're doing cash advance.  Why not just support debit cards?), which I don't have.  So ... how hard is it to get fiat into bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:30:11
I have funds.  I don't see now debit cards would be a problem: I can get cash for them at an ATM anywhere.  Coinbase just hasn't done the work.
Jesus, I have a fucking credit card.  Lots.  My debit card are all VISA.  I also have a few MasterCards and an AmEx.  I've been buying things for decades, and this is the first time I haven't had the "right" card.

I'm aware of it.  It has its own dangers, but anyway, not an option where I am.

Seriously?  WTF, LTC?  Shouldn't it be a simple modification of the existing bitcoin modules?
Speaking of which, I was going to ask, what did you use to create your store?  I thought your site was nice.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:57:39
I agree, but I'm happy to see it: I look forward to buying when the dust settles.

You don't accept payment in litecoin?

CampBX doesn't seem to support CapitalOne 360 P2P.  Maybe you need to be verified?

I agree that passwords are a terrible authentication mechanism and we should stop using them.  Most browsers support client side certificates.  However, the user model is not very good and they aren't used very much.  The one exception I know personally is on MIT's internal network.  I think a model that supports a digital signing device (eg hardware wallet) would be very valuable.
In the large scale, the problem of adoption makes me pessimistic.  How do you get a billion web sites to switch off passwords, esp. when you have to compete with Facebook Connect, Google sign in, OpenID, etc., where powerful entities are trying to capture the authentication market instead of supporting a distributed model like digital signatures?  It all makes me sad.

If you're building at this scale, you'd put a maximal number of cards per motherboard.  That's 7+, so about 14 computers.  I agree about the cooling, tho.  Still, at these prices, ASICs are not beating GPUs for MH/$, but they do scale better.

So they find about 1/4 of all BTC?  Wow.

Funny.  When the stock market goes crazy, it's rational market theory this and rational market theory that.  But when the Bitcoin foreign exchange market goes crazy, it's an insane surge.  Hmm.

30K in 7950s will get the same hash rate.  $20-40K buys a lot of electricity.

Hmm, now I wonder, how does this work for them?  Do they use BitPay?  Does their POS handle bitcoin?  How do they handle exchange rates?  Do they have to wait for 6 confirms?  (That's like an hour!)
Just thinking of the questions I'd expect from a business owner.

CampBX accepts Dwolla.  That might be the fastest way if OP has Dwolla set up.

That's fair; removed.
