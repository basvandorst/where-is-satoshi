Wait, bitcoin is smaller than the traditional banking system?
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:53:32
Appropriately rekt.
When is coinage going to get more liquidity? Partner with other exchanges or market makers to fix this.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:47:54
Yes, they are. ACH payments are reversible.
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:41:25
I don't believe so, they still have to follow federal laws.

I'd pay 5c, but only to sell at $1.69
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:19:14
Didn't look at that, guessing they're new then.
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:59:02
No, you're not. You're build a multi-sig brokerage. Not an exchange.
There is nothing wrong with that, but I'm talking specifically about order book exchanges
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:15:27
I would love it if you would enlighten me as to what I have missed?
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:42:26
None, they don't exist. Can't really be done, although Stamp using multi sig cosigned by BitGo is a nice start
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:50:45
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:57:36
Doesn't look multi-sig, either
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:47:43
Because you can't buy from BitPay, and Circle is shit?
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:29:52
Pretty low effort compared to the last time traveller we received.
Need more details OP.
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:59:13
Yes, although I think they have a good case because of the fact they don't have custody of funds and the service is tailored to places like exchanges whereas credit cards are to consumers.
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:45:50
You can through some third party services, i.e 
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:41:32
Its the fact that banks can't legally work with them.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:42:50
Are your groceries a fungible, transferable, non-perishing asset?
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:13:17
I said *could*, I use mytrezor.com - I was just addressing the statement that it could never happen IDGAF
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:21:13
You can't see what you're signing though from what I have seen.
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:33:40
Can't you just use an exchange which uses a UK bank?
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:05:16
Its a pretty solid phone OS
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:45:44
From a quick google I found  who claim to accept UK bank transfers
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:56:00
I would imagine their patents are for risk systems for bitcoin transactions. They won't sign transactions that don't meet certain criteria.
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:39:07
Because fiat currencies aren't decentralized?
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:33:16
Their CEO talks about how bitcoin is going to fail, yet can't even cntrl + f 'virtual currencies'
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:14:02
A cheese grater is solid. The OS itself is solid, and from what I have seen it stands up quite well security wise against other OSes.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:29:49
Circle is definitely shit, but you're only allowed to use BitPay as a merchant.
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:00:58
They could create a separate fork of core and keep it up to date.
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:31:38
 If he got the hot wallet he has all the deposit addresses. Its some poor guys (like ATMs) who are sending money to the deposit addresses.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:06:34
Yes, often did it by changing bitcoin addresses shown on browser
