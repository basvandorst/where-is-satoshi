I'm impressed you've been sifting through the Internet looking for bitcoin keys. Ingenious! It's akin to the metal detecting hobbyists and treasure hunters. I bet you've learned a thing or two about in-depth searching and algorithms. I hadn't heard of anyone doing this before. Way to go!
BTW, you are doing the right thing by trying to find the person who lost them. It may be painful to give them up but you'll be a better person for having done so. Your mom, the Internet, and the might-be recipient are proud of you.
[EDIT] After reading some other posts, it's come to my attention that your actions might be more akin to looking for unlocked cars than metal detecting. If this is the case, you should stop.

Lots of people don't care about lots of stuff but those people should care about that stuff.
For example, lots of people don't vote in elections. This may be because they don't care or are uninformed or lazy or ignorant or... "reasons".
One of those reasons may be because they think that the vote they would cast would be insignificant. But the fact of the matter is that people should vote.
In general and in life, people make mistakes when they don't care about issues or think those issues are insignificant.
I really care about Bitcoin and I hope that bitcoin transactions will always carry a low, low fee and I consider this issue to be significant, regardless of bitcoins value. I realize that others don't care about these issues but if they use Bitcoin, they should. And just because they don't care or know, it doesn't mean they should be taken advantage of.

Satoshidice has not used 6% of BCH's block space.  They have instead accounted for 6% of BCH's transaction count. Big difference.
100% of BCH's entire transaction count is still only a fraction of total available block space (8mb) and the block space is adjustable. The Satoshidice figures are miniscule to block space.

Would Core or OP be willing to advocate for a hard fork implementing a blocksize increase rather than the new recommended transaction techniques? I think it can be hard on merchants and consumers to know an exact and mutually desired confirmation speeds. I'm also having difficulty knowing when a few pennies more is just the right amount of more fees. Or should fees instead be set at the same fee structure as Visa/Mastercharge? Is there instead anything that could be done where we all strive for a common goal of zero fees or virtually no fees or free-market based fees rather than a pile-on-the-pennies approach?

You seem to want to redefine how cryptocoin market caps are defined. Why? You are saying the "true" market cap factors lost/destroyed coins into the equation. Ok, how many coins have been forever lost/destroyed so far then? How many more in the future will be forever lost/destroyed? You can never know the answers to these questions. I think we should keep the current definition since it's the only one that can be defined with absolute 100% certainty. We can at least say this is the true standard.

Well, the Bolivar itself can't be kicked any further. It's been ruined by central banks/government. But you are right about not wanting to fix the system. Human nature has shown that governments and large organizations don't want the difficult and painful changes to happen on their watch.
Soon, fiats across the globe will be meeting the same fate. It is so sad and was all so unavoidable had sensible monetary policies existed. Policies like a gold-backed currency chief among them.

Can I swap out my 401(k) and other retirement accounts for an ETF without tax penalty and have it still count as a tax-protected retirement account? So is a Bitcoin based ETF not 100% bitcoins? Or does that defeat the true purpose of a safely divested retirement vehicle? Yes, I'm an idiot about retirement stuff.

Luke Jr knows a lot more than just about anyone else in the world about p2p distributed protocol engineering but that doesn't mean that he's great at it or can't be completely wrong. An analogy can be that the leader of North Korea knows more than me at running a country but I believe he is doing the exact opposite of what needs to be done.

You don't need to be a dev to know the answer the question. The devs don't know the answer. The answer is no one. No one has a clue as to when LN and SegWit will be activated. For all we know, one or neither may never get activated. Yet here we wait and wait and wait.

@_date: 2016-05-24 22:05:27
I don't think so, but in any case, do you have dates on when LN and SegWit will be implemented? Do you know if core will scale?
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:21:55
Big whoop that were doing "fine". Bitcoin should be doing "incredible". But it's not. Innovation should be non-stop and achieving amazing new feats. Instead we keep waiting and waiting for such uninspiring things like Lighting Network and Segregated Witness? Nobody considers LN and SegWit as the next big thing. Nobody cares about it except for it to happen so we can then maybe finally move forward. Maybe then scale. Maybe. Then it will be time to innovate! Except then maybe nobody will care about bitcoin. But hey, in the meantime bitcoin is doing fine.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:28:25
25 basis points would be 25% of 1%, i.e. 0.25% not 25.0%. Isn't Coinbase 1.0%?
