A simplified explaination: 
If the value of Bitcoin is $32 and you want to exchange a large quantity into fiat, the value drops with $10 that made you lose out 30%. 
However if the value is 1000 and the value drops to 990, that would only be 1%.

Bitcoin has "proven" to be a great long term store of value if you look at it over more than 2 year span.
And its not cumbersome compared to creditcards that require you to type in a whole array of info, unless you give it away. 
Development is proving you wrong.

The second best option.
Do you have a old secondhand laptop? 
If not, you can get a secondhand laptop very cheap. 
 
Goto bitadress.org
Rightclick and save the page.
Here is a youtube tutorial. 
But don´t use the same computer you use for surfing it might have trojans/keyloggers/taking screenshots.
Put the file on a USBstick or burn it to a cd/dvd/bluray and bring it to your disconnected laptop.
Open and save the file you saved "bitadress.htm" in a webbrowser on your old laptop. 
Generate a couple of adresses and print them out.
Send your coins to those adresses.
Thats it.
Put them in a bankdepositbox. 
Don´t store them at home in case of burglary/fire.
Another even easier option could be to get a Piper Wallet.
When its easy to store them safe it will be mainstream and the value will probably be 10x today.

If price is "stable" for any period longer, than its useful.
 If its useful, price increases.
If price increases, its desirable, because its a great investment and a store of value and its desirable.
If its desirable, people want to accept and trade it for their goods.
For every day its still here and price is not only going down, trust and credibility increase.
When trust and credibility increase, it gains new users, than value increase.
Currencies such as Bitcoin, if not Bitcoin will spread and be used all over the world, they will take over fiat currencies that abuse inflation and force other fiat currencies to not abuse inflation. 
Its only a matter of time and it has already begun.

I don´t think that millions of people who live in Venezuela, Argentina (Which used to be the 3rd largest economy in the world) and who lost 90% of their value of their savings the last 10 years agree.
You might want to add up the population of these countries and se how many millions who have been affected only in the last century by "Scarce not a great concern"...

Last time I checked there were governments even in the 1950s when we had totally anonymous cash money only.
 
A government is simply people who are elected by the majority to make laws and if the majority follow those laws, they can force them on the rest. 
As long as a majority come to that agreement Bitcoin will not change that in any way.

Anyone can go out creating a new Soda brand such as CocaCola, with some cane sugar. Yet Coca Cola brand is worth 179.19B.
Thats despite the fact that there is not even any Network Effect, your drink of Coca Cola does not become tastier(more worth) simply because someone else also drinks the same Cola brand.

Many are convinced it was created by a anonymous "powerful mastermind" that goes under a pseudonym.
Tends to be highly addictive to humans. 
Mafia us it to kill people.
In China it was used to torture people. 
Used as a dangerous method of diet that can cause anorexia.
Many criminals abuse it to get rid of their victims or other evidence.
Every year thousands of people are killed by Dihydrogen Monoxide. 
Many of those are children who finds it, just laying outside are drawn to it, and wants to play with it.
Energy produced from it can be used to manufacture weapons of mass destruction.

Perhaps not...
"... the only episode in which we find evidence of a link between deflation and depression is the Great Depression (1929-34). We find virtually no evidence of such a link in any other period. ... **What is striking is that nearly 90% of the episodes with deflation did not have depression.** In a broad historical context, beyond the Great Depression, the notion that deflation and depression are linked **virtually disappears.** "
"...Incidentally, every country that has employed fair Gold coinage has prospered while those that inflated their coinage with "base" metals failed.
One example is Spain. During the time that Spain was issuing their famous "pieces of eight" it was a world "superpower" but lost that status as it debased its currency."




Do they borrow money because they expect to make a loss?
Thats the conclusion I draw from your reasoning. 
Both you and the lender are aware that it is deflation and you borrow because you have a good business idea or a good education that will make you more profit than you could do if you did not borrow. 
Thus it will not "work against their own interest", because in the end, the outcome is a increase in income for them. And how is that against their own interest?
Tell me a single human being, that will stop and think like you just said.
Hey, if I borrow money to make a company that makes me profit, it will "strengthen the economy" so much that I rather just stay and live on my halfass salary.
In reality and not in the textbook, not a single person will stop and think like that, not a single one.
 
Unless you are thinking of borrowing simply to consume, in which case you should not had borrowed at all because in the long run it will weaken the economy.

Unlike "fiat", which has also have artificial scarcity but only benefits those who own the banks, that creates more of it, but only lends it out, forcing house prices to go up, forcing people to take on bigger loans forever putting people into more and more debt.

Getting into Bitcoin now is probably quite a good time, as there is no fast rise in price, and the fall have slowed down and even started to flatten out, there are hints that its starting to turn around.
 
But its a longterm game, in ten years it might be up 10-100 times in value and it might have peaked at 20-200 times the value it is at today, this is actually quite likely to happen as more people/companies begin to see the advantages of Bitcoin, not the opposite, and understand that it is not a Ponzi/Pyramid but a protocol with the same global rules for everyone. 
However don´t go in with more than you can afford.
If you have money in a bank account how much interest rate do you get? 
If you even twice that, it was still a better move than keeping the money in the bank.

No its not a either or, just like gold/silver or any other currency it could find a niche and be used in some countries or by some companies or in some situations, from there se it could go to a million, but that could take hundreds of years. Ofcourse in thousands of years it will either be at zero or millions.

Yes, why do Coca Cola have value when anyone can create their own cola brand, it could probably even be tastier. Its not easy to copy or create a network effect.
Another problem is to copy all the computer hardware that have been bought just to make up the Bitcoin network.
But sure there will be some extra inflation in the cryptocurrency space as a whole sector, due to other currencies.

Its not safe, but its much safer than when it had increased a lot over a short term.
Another question is if you want to miss out on an opportunity to get into something that could increase 10-100x in value over the next 10-20 years?
But still don´t invest more than you can in case it drops some more.

And if you know there are going to come packages sent to a certain mayor or some public figure with illegal content. Then great for the police. They can now start to track down from where any packages to those are sent, circling some of the sellers of illegal goods.
