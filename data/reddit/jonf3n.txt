I totally get you about being swamped, but really these guys should be able to setup bitcoin payment easier than 99.999% of the businesses out there.  They are browser wallet developers!
If they were really so busy, they could just post a single address and have each user sign a message showing they owned the private key of the transaction input.  OR they could hand out addresses by email after your order as part of an invoice.
Yes, these methods are totally crude, nerdy and complex, but anything is better than not accepting bitcoin.

Not necessarily. Running a node isn't expensive in itself (unlike mining).
Old school hodlers might be comfortable with very small returns if it means they can participate without permission and stay in crypto while enhancing the utility (value) of the crypto they have.
There is also a lot of idealists who would strongly prefer to even take a loss than to cash out (if it came to that).
People who want control and additional privacy might run nodes because it allows their payments to be mixed in with the others being relayed, even if it is not profitable.

It's important to realize that "consensus" here in Bitcoinland only refers to very specific "consensus rules" of the software. These rules form a contract defining what is allowed on the network. Introducing changes to those rules is dangerous as it basically creates a new coin type. Technical changes which don't affect those specific rules are dramatically less dangerous and do not require network concensus.
TL;DR; Here, "concensus" does not mean agreement amongst devs and users on priorities

Hardware wallets are designed specifically to not leak the private keys. They can be _connected_ to a "hot" (online) computer to collect the transaction data needed, to be updated and to facilitate transaction signing. That usually involves some data (`xpub`) leaving the device though, so not great for privacy.
NOTE: The design of the TREZOR for example is completely open, so you could build your own.
If you don't trust the hardware wallet, you can collect the data you need (outputs being spent and destination address), bring it all to an air gapped computer and then use the hardware wallet to construct + sign the transaction there. Then bring back online to broadcast.

The longer I think about all this and see what Bitcoin does well and not so well... The more I see it as a reserve currency or asset. I've been in this scene many years and increasingly, it appears that bitcoin will be the foundation for other payment systems (OT, LN, sidechains, etc) or used for large international payments where it is is a faster, safer alternative to a flight with briefcase full of cash.
Coinbase is doing a great job of creating bridges to the Fiat economy. Bitcoin will need these bridges (training wheels) until it matures and attracts more users.  I'm happy to have a "PayPal" built around Bitcoin as it makes BTC immediately more useful and less scary for more people. It also make it less of a problem for me to invest more in BTC because I know I can use it to buy the things I need. Total investment in BTC is still too low to be considered safe against an attack. The network software also needs much work (many years) before it can truly scale.
We have a long, long road ahead and this bitcoin-coinbase-visa card is just one rung in the ladder. Merchant adoption has stalled (they never held bitcoin anyway), so this is just a step forward. Such things will not hold back real development from ALSO taking place.

@_date: 2015-06-25 23:57:08


Nobody is being pushed  off. I suggest we capitalize on the strengths of Bitcoin and build tools that scale on top of it. Are you familiar with how these work? They are nothing like Coinbase, etc.   They use the same cryptographic guarantees and transaction signing facilities, etc as a normal Bitcoin transaction... They are still decentralized, secure, trustless, etc. These are the systems I suggest we explore and make available.
Using an on-chain bitcoin transaction to buy a coffee is like hiring an armored  car to transport $3 -- its overkill.


Exactly, that is why I'm advocating more efficient systems which could batch together hundreds or thousands of off-chain transactions into a single on-chain transaction. This would justify much higher transaction fees and compensate for the halving of the block reward. At the same time, small off-chain  transactions could become much cheaper as they would only need to cover a tiny fraction of the final on-chain transaction.
*Edit: typos and additional clarification of off-chain transaction fees.*
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:27:47
Sounds like GreenAddress, Bitgo, etc. Unfortunately multisig only works on-chain. Bitcoin transactions are too slow and expensive for micropayments and this will get worse as block reward is halved.
Brian is right that for this sort of application, centralized solutions involving trust are the only viable option at the moment. They can be vendor neutral (choose from Circle or Coinbase, etc) but it boils down to this: 
The Bitcoin network is expensive to operate and keep trustless, decentralized and censorship resistant. The security it provides is overkill for microtransactions.
LN, Open Transactions, Sidechains, etc will give us decentralized, trustless options and I'm sure others will follow, but the majority of transactions must happen off the Bitcoin Blockchain in order to meet usability / financial goals of micropayments.

Are you saying that it is okay on Coinbase.com, but not LocalBitcoins.com? If the sale is declared to the proper tax authorities and you are not laundering or something, this seems unlikely to be illegal. I believe in some US states there may be an assumption that you need a license for money transmission if selling for cash as a business (New York, Florida, etc). The amounts probably factor in as well.

What makes you think sidechains would centralize the network?
They would open up many new options for Bitcoin development without the need for an altcoin and all the crazy value fluctuation that comes with that.
@_date: 2015-12-05 11:55:15
Good question. In order for coins to be useful in the sidechain, they must be transferable and divisible. Eg: I sent 1btc to sidechain, then spend .5 btc on something, then recipient of course needs to know they can do what they want with that .5 btc.
This would imply that they are independent from the original bitcoins that were frozen.  If users had to gather the exact same coins in order to move back to Bitcoin Blockchain, sidechains wouldn't be very valuable.
It seems the *amount* of bitcoins transferred into the sidechain and the amount transferred out might need to be equal. However this outgoing transfer could be a CoinJoin (many people simultaneously sell their sidechain coins and receive Bitcoin in a single transaction).

The blocksize will **never** increase enough to accommodate all the transactions we would like to see on the network (payment channels, etc actually could). At the same time, as the blocks are increased in size, the network becomes less censorship resistant / more centralized because its hard to move those blocks around fast enough to achieve consensus.
Why risk the entire network to add a feature which is not even needed yet? I say keep Bitcoin stable and decentralized at all costs.
 
Let the blocksize increase slowly and with lots of testing.

I'm not talking about "the status quo"... I was talking about major technical enhancements to the Bitcoin network.  Improvements that might be too risky or controversial to implement directly but which could be easily done in a sidechain (without permission, long technical discussions, etc).  If the sidechain actually works, and is popular, the improvement could be merged into Bitcoin Core.


Bitcoin can also be run by "centralized entities", but that doesn't make Bitcoin centralized... anyone can run it.  Why do you think this would be different for a sidechain?
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:51:18
The Bitcoin network is actually quite expensive to maintain. Raising the transaction fees and moving the majority of the transactions off-chain **is a realistic solution to the scalability problem** (unlike the block-size increase). The guarantees Bitcoin provides should be the foundation on which much faster and cheaper payment systems[1] are built.
[1] Just to be clear, I am referring to decentralized, secure systems like Payment Channels, Open Transactions, Side Chains, etc.

People "spending" bitcoin to buy things they need would be great. This is how btc cements itself as a currency into the economy.
Will make much more sense once the Lightning Network is stable and we have good interfaces. Eventually I believe LN transactions could operate similar to how an anti-inflationary gold-backed currency once did (except backed by Bitcoin rather than gold). 
Because LN uses real Bitcoin transactions, we don't need to worry about another "[Nixon Shock]( type of event. Secret inflation is also not an issue as it was under [Bretton Woods]( as the underlying asset is always redeemable.

Democracy is about the ability of partipants in a system to decide the rules of that system collectively.  When I run a full node, or contribute code or discussion points, I am partipating directly in the shaping of this system, validation of transactions, etc.  By purchasing bitcoin, one's actions have a direct affect on the market, which is another way to express its value to you and increase its value in comparison to fiat.
There is no reason to believe bitcoin itself will be distributed equally amongst people as long as we live under capitalism.
However, the technology could very easily allow for people currently excluded from the global financial system, to suddenly compete in that system and therefore benefit from the same financial rewards as someone born in a wealthier country.  In that way, it is more inclusive.

The whole system would be **_dramatically_** more secure if it produced BIP38 encrypted addresses and had a small screen to show users the generated password.  Such a system would alleviate most of my concerns and result in safer paper wallets (as long as password was kept separate from the paper wallet).
Should also have a physical "print" button so it could be used with older, dumber printers.
Any plans to create something like that?

Don't HODL... Experiment, learn, pay in BTC whenever possible (then buy more the same day). Teach others, create a BIP38 paper wallet for savings. Make micro-donations to your favorite charities, etc.
Bitcoin is not a good financial investment per say, but if we all help it to become more usable, it could *one day* become something fantastic for the world.  Once you give up on getting rich and instead realize you are "investing" in the future, you'll start to really see what we are excited about.

By running a full node you directly contribute to the strength an speed of the Bitcoin network by hosting a copy of the blockchain.  Full nodes [provide the data needed for lightweight mobile and desktop apps]( (mobile wallets, MultiBit, etc).  These apps are critical to the usability of bitcoin, but they cannot function without full nodes -- their security relies on a large pool of nodes providing blockchain data.
Running your own node gives you the certainty that **at least one node** out there is reliable, trustworthy and accurate. You can use the "Trusted Node" option in the Android bitcoin wallet to connect directly to your own node for example.
There are other reasons like being able to verify transactions locally.  By running a node, you directly vote for keeping bitcoin decentralized, increase the speed of the network and provide a public service to those using lightweight wallet apps -- and it cost almost nothing.

It seems that people could benefit from say a paper wallet, even if they don't have a mobile phone they could save. Having the opportunity to save _some portion_ of their earnings (or receive funds from family far away) seems like it would still be useful.  They could check their balance on a community phone if needed,  that service could even be a source of income for someone in a village (eg $0.01 to check balance, $0.10 to print new BIP38 paper wallet or $0.05 to send a transaction). Same  business could offer cash-for-btc conversion if needed. Internet cafes would allow more technical users to manage wallet themselves.
Such systems should be introduced by experienced people, but if they make money, it could become popular enough that others might learn how to setup a similar shop.

I agree that it currently has very little volume as a form of payment, but it is exactly this *potential* for growth that gives bitcoin backing as a "store of value".  People are speculating on its future usefulness in low-friction micropayments, remmitance, etc -- that is why the price is going up in relation to fiat.
Bitcoin only has value because people *agee* it has value in terms of usefulness.  Why is bitcoin's blockchain any better store of value than hundreds of other cryptocurrencies?  They all store numbers only, it is we humans that attribute "value" to these numbers in a database, they have no intrinsic value.
Dollars, Euros, etc. have value to humans because we work for them, we can get things we need with them and they trade at higher value because they are usefull in more places and stronger economies than other currencies. They also have no intrinsic value.
Gold has some usefulness in manufacturing, but this has little relationship to the value we attribute to it. It lasts forever, feels nice in the hand, is easy to identify, looks shiny and was difficult to find -- this is why it was usable anywhere on earth and seen as valuable for the last few millenia. It is that history of "value" (cultural momentum) that gives it much of its percieved value today (very postmodern :)

* Create Your own BIP38 wallet with bitaddress.org code (learn how to do offline). Never type the password into another computer again... Maybe could use her social security number, name, date of birth, etc to generate. Find a way to remember the password without writing down literally.
* Buy 3 identical stainless wallets like this one using your encrypted key:
* Store the three wallets in geographically distant locations (in case of flood, etc), safe deposit boxes, etc.
After a couple years, you can transfer to a better wallet like BIP32 / multisig, or whatever is most safe then. :-)

The private keys that unlock the bitcoins stay on the device, nothing dangerous goes into or out of the device - only transactions.

Bitcoin can work in these situations, but the wallet software / supporting infrastructure to make it easy / safe needs to be further developed.

This can be a little difficult to understand at first, but the bitcoins are not litterly stored anywhere... Think of them as being "in the cloud". What you store is the private keys that allow you alone to unlock and *_spend_* the bitcoin. 
The " keys" are just very long pieces of text, like an impossible to guess password. They are generated by a computer. They can be encrypted and backed up like any file to keep them safe.
There are many ways to manage the keys, all have various strengths/weaknesses in terms of security, ease of use, risk of losing the keys yourself. I agree that blockchain.info is a good place for beginners, but make sure to use 2FA! If the amount goes over 1BTC, definitely look into a "Paper wallet" (mentioned below) which are dramatically safer and easy to use once you understand how to safely create / use.
Final parting words: with bitcoin you have the chance to "be your own bank"... Which means you also have the chance to " lose all your money" if you are not careful.  Move slowly, read a lot, ask questions, experiment with small amounts and enjoy the freedom / responsibility of being a monetary grown up.

Some suggestions:
* Can you provide some proof that you have access to the ~$183,860 so we know you are for real?  Your account is new and scammers try these kinds of things often.
* If you can, work with [Andreas Antonopoulos](- he is a recognized and reputable member of the Bitcoin community.  He has the skills to securely collect the funds and I think many would trust him to think through the details and do things right.  However he is a busy guy, so this may not be a priority for him ;-)
* It makes much more sense if you supply the 1 BRK.A and bitcoin bulls supply the 300 BTC.  It is winner-takes-all bet, so it doesn't matter who supplies what if they are the same price on the day you start. (That is the intention, right?)
* Bitcoin is super volatile so the "price" should be an *average* of the USD exchange rate across the top X number of exchanges by volume (like [Bitcoin Average](  It should also be averaged over 24+ hours to ensure that sudden spikes or troughs don't skew things.
Look forward to seeing where this goes.

I think you are misunderstanding.

In 1 year they compare the stock value to the BTC value:
* If the stock is worth more than 300btc, Buffett-Bitcoin gets both the stock and the Bitcoin.
* If the BTC guy is right (the value went up more than the stock), he gets both the stock and the 300btc.

You are correct: BIP-38 paper wallet, created on a secure computer, with a secure password, **is quite safe**.
It can be emailed, but would ideally be swept into another address after being received because the password is no longer secure after being spoken over phone.  If the amount is not large and the recipient has a mobile phone, they could use Mycelium.

Not literally  :-)  
But yes, most are forks of bitcoind, that still does not mean that they have good wallet options, are trusted by experienced users / businesses or offer any significant advantage over Bitcoin.  Should point out that being "cheaper" is not an advantage really, just a matter of decimal places.
If an altcoin comes out that really is dramatically better, then this could change things quickly, but not overnight.  I expect this *will* actually happen eventually, but Bitcoin has tremendous momentum and will not die quickly.  Very smart developers around the world are behind it, so Bitcoin itself can adopt features of other coins as well.


It can be hugely beneficial already, but there are chicken and egg problems with getting customers to adopt before business adopt etc. so this slows things down, but the seeds are planted.  Those who adopt early are being rewarded.
Also there is much work still to be done in the user interfaces - making it easy to use and secure bitcoins.  This is the sort of infrastructure that I was referring to (Trezor, HDM wallets, decentralized exchanges with multisig, etc).  These things will help make Bitcoin more popular and decentralized – people currently use web wallets, centralized exchanges, etc. because we don't have great alternatives *yet*, but these things are being built and tested right now.


The "middlemen" we have today are a critical part of getting this thing off the ground, but won't be necessary in the future when decentralized alternatives mature.  There will be other options for those "middlemen" to provide services.  
It takes time.

We should demand platforms that give users complete control over their private keys. Until we have a good, reliable, active exchange supporting multisig, these are all at risk.

I disagree, BitcoinQT is not the right way to get started with Bitcoin. The blockchain download alone is quite discouraging, but there are other idiosyncrasies that make this a bad choice for beginners.
After experimenting with Coinbase, something like Blockchain.info offers a lot of interesting privacy options, etc, but you still maintain control over your keys (no *mystery transactions* like Coinbase). This offeres a nice balance of control and ease of use across devices, easy backups, etc.
When ready to take on securing your own private keys, I'd suggest an SPV wallet like the [Android Wallet]( or MultiBit. They are very fast to install and begin using, but they keep your keys local on one device with all the power and danger that comes along with that.

Cryptocurrency still needs to mature before it's ready for mainstream adoption. Enthusiasts can help lead the way by contributing to open source projects (submitting high quality bug reports helps as well!). Just experimenting with the technology, learning how it works, limitations, security, etc. and being able to explain this to others will help accelerate adoption and pave the road for less technical folks to join later.
One can't rush things this big, there is still much work to do (make HDM wallets the standard, multiple open hardware wallets, "BTM" machines in every major city, better accounting software and trustworthy exchange options, etc.) Right now we need sustainable adoption from those who can help build out the infrastructure.  If we do a good job, others will continue to join us.

I agree with much of this, prudence is warranted.
But wanted to point out that one of Bitcoin's greatest assets is its development community which is continuously improving the usability, security and features of every aspect of the network. Doge cannot compare in this regard.  Another is the massive investment in infrastructure that Bitcoin has behind it (miners, businesses like Coinbase, Kraken, etc that all have a deep vested interest in seeing it succeed).
I don't expect the value of bitcoin to go up 1000% or replace the current financial system, but I think crypto currencies *will* have an impact that is 1000% larger than what we see today. Bitcoin is a vehicle to invest in the R&amp;D that is needed for that 1000% increase in crypto currency use worldwide.

BTC will not go to $0 tomorrow or in the next year.
It might lose **a lot of value** in comparison to USD, but will not become worthless.  It is still an extremely valuable platform regardless of the current USD value it trades for and there are *many* people putting their of time / effort / money behind it – they obviously value BTC and will continue to for a while.


I agree with this, a large drop is much more likely with BTC, than BRK, but the potential to rise is greater with BTC.  Still points out below that the winner only takes away ~10% in the end.  Still not bad if you are bullish on bitcoin and would just have them sitting around anyway.  If it is crowd funded, the bitcoiners can limit their exposure.

Electrum and Mycelium give the user 100% control over their private keys - always. They cannot "freeze" bitcoins where you have the only copy of the private key. They are also OpenSource, so we know what the code is doing.
Coinbase on the other hand DOES have access to private keys, they generate them for you. Coinbase, Circle, all exchanges, etc can do what they like with Bitcoin they hold.
There are hybrid options like GreenAddress or Bitgo that use multisig to allow something in between.

I think you are misunderstanding how Bitcoin works. Devs can create whatever code they want. Users, miners, exchanges, etc must **choose** what to run or not run, that is their prerogative.
The code that participants run determines which network they are part of, if the consensus rules of two nodes differ, then they are simply 2 different networks.
That being said, neither Peter Todd (nor any other Bitcoin Core devs) are actually proposing that the issuance schedule be changed. Even if he was proposing that, it would not matter because no one is obligated to run his code.

Once the system is more stable, one might think of opening / closing channels similar to the same actions with an online account, issuing / revoking a credit card, etc... not something you would do often.
*Refilling* will most likely be done off-chain meaning the actual fee for the refill will be almost nothing, just need a way to get another party to transfer money into to your channel.  Could pay them with an altcoin, refill / pay them as part of another on-chain tx, use paypal, do some work and get paid via LN, hand cash to someone who has excess capacity, etc.  If on-chain fees go up super-high, entrepreneurs will step in to open huge channels in 1 tx, then sell you small top-ups for some amount between *$offchain-fee* and *$onchain-fee*.  Competition will keep it reasonable.
Users will get used to refilling with at least $10 or $20 at a time like they do with prepaid mobile credit.  But after that they might hypothetically make 1000+ transactions with that channel.  This is what I mean by *micro payments*.

BitGo relies on their 2-of-3 multisig wallet implementation  (will not work without their service). Under normal circumstances, they simply block double-spends with the key they hold. But the crucial point is that a Key Recovery Service ([KRS](
 holds a third "backup" key and also needs to be blocked from signing a double-spend transaction.
BitGo claims that they have contracts with KRS to "notify" them of a double-spend, therefore enabling this system to work. But this opens up important questions not properly discussed on their site:
1. I can apparently [run my own KRS]( but this would break the entire underwriting model. Does BitGo limit *Instant* transactions to only particular KRS?
2. Can BitGo block a KRS from signing a transaction it doesn't like or prevent users from retrieving the second private key? If so, this breaks the trustless security of their multisig wallet.
What am I missing here?
TL;DR;  **How can BitGo's 2-of-3 implimentation be trustless *AND* safely used for Instant transfer?**

With Coinbase the IOUs are simply issued by the company. They don't even have solid legal backing.
With LN cryptography ensures ownership (as with all bitcoins). Bitcoin is not literally "owned", but rather ownership is inferred by possession of the private key that allows spending. Although there may be a **delay** in your ability to spend when using LN, "ownership" is still the same as without LN.

It's a cool system, but unfortunatly requires significant trust in BitGo and its vetted KRS partners.

Thank you for this post.
 
I also met Mike back in 2013 while working at Google. He would hold "Bitcoin lunches", send out internal newsletters and was the main person advocating (and working on) Bitcoin within Google.  He even sold me my first bitcoin.
 
Although our political views and motivations may be quite different, I still learned a lot from him and, like many, was inspired by the various talks he gave on smart property, etc.  He deserves credit for the significant technical contributions he has made to Bitcoin. BitcoinJ was instrumental in making Bitcoin user-friendly and increasing adoption of decentralized "lite" SPV clients (rather than web-wallets). Lighthouse was a bold attempt to get funding for Core development.
 
I've been saddened by the last few months and the hostility that has gripped these forums regarding the competing visions of Bitcoin. 
I completly support his decision to move on to other things and hope that we as a community can get back to the spirit of collaboration, purpose and yes, fun that built Bitcoin into what it is today.

He is pointing out that a very small inflation rate (in his opinion) would help to ensure the longevity of the system so we wouldn't rely entirely on fees after 2140.
I agree with him. It doesn't sound as _sexy_ as "There will never be more than 21 million", but I think it would be a more robust &amp; sustainable economic model if the was low inflation. As is, fees will need to significantly increase or security will be drastically reduced... Probably both. But that is the model Satoshi chose.

* No chargebacks (good for merchants).
* Micro payments far smaller than possible today.
* No KYC / account setup needed to send OR receive.
* Merchants don't need to check ID, deal with signatures , etc.
* Works in ALL countries (even the moon hypothetically)
* Potential to become faster than visa eventually.
* Much cheaper.
* Programmable money. Can have very complex restraints / smart contracts.
* CC companies spy on users, sell detailed purchase data, etc.
* There is no "Fraud department" that will "freeze your card" because you travel to someplace they don't expect, buy too many things in a row, etc. I've had to call Citibank many times, wait on hold, prove who I am (insulting!), etc because of their fuckups. Very annoying when you are not at home!
* Merchants you do business with cannot later "withdraw" money from your account.
* Merchants you do business with will not automatically get your address / phone number -- or even your name. You only need to disclose information necessarily for the services they are providing you.
* IOT payments, especially across borders, etc.
* WikiLeaks donation.
* No age restrictions on LN (just like cash).

Bitcoin doesn't "run out"... The exchange rate just changes to compensate.
If you are really concerned that there is "not enough units" (2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis will be mined eventually), then realize that such a system would probably run on the Lightning Network, which adds 1000× units. LN can add subunits if needed, but don't think we'll need it.

*on chain* fees are calculated based on the amount of data in the transaction. Doesn't matter how much BTC is being sent. $0.06 is about right. The thing is you could have sent your brother $31,000,000 for the same fee ;-)
Different wallets have different ways of calculating fees, so some will be more accurate than others, but this doesn't sound bad.
Small payments will get MUCH better once we have stable _off-chain_ solutions like the Lightning Network. You can use it today, but it is still very experimental and tricky. Fees in the LN are calculated based on the **amount** sent and are much lower or practically free.

The IRS is playing a tricky game here by waiting for years until they then request this info. With such a mapping of humans to addresses they can de-anonimize the transactions of almost anyone that ever used the service.
Interestingly, this will help to educate the public about Bitcoin's lack of transaction confidentiality and motivate people to look into solutions like Monero, Zcash, CoinShuffle, JoinMarket, etc. This is a step in the right direction towards true electronic cash.
The fact that one service (Coinbase) could potentially leak so much info on so many people will also get users thinking...

Bitcoin is not treated like a "currency" by the IRS, but rather an asset that is bought / sold.
This means you must pay capital gains whenever it is "sold" for another currency or used to purchase something else. It also means that if the USD value of bitcoin completely tanks, we can write off the loss... It's a double edged sword. This makes bitcoin use **very** complex for Americans, but there is a silver lining of sorts. It also creates a huge burden on the IRS if bitcoin takes off.

@_date: 2015-08-29 15:17:18
I appreciate your effort in outlining these points 2015 bits Although I am fairly new to all of this, I feel like some of your assumptions amount to strawman arguments:


Timeouts can be as small as needed, there is no reason to assume a month or even multiple days.  Anyone "living paycheck to paycheck" would want to have small timeouts, probably with multiple hubs so there is adequate cashflow.


Of course this leads to inefficiencies if Alice locks up all of her money in a payment channel for a month and then wants to make on-chain payments.  Anyone who literally is living paycheck to paycheck will have to do tricky things to make it work out... there is no good reason why Alice should lock up all of her income with a log timeout – that would not be wise or necessary for the system to be very useful.
As I understand it, the efficiencies that LN offers are more of the type where we want hundreds or thousands of micro-transactions (mobile service paid by the minute, streaming video paid by the second, etc.) usually to the same provider.  This would just be a different way to use bitcoin when a "on blockchain" transactions would be overkill and inefficient.


Seems the timeouts would naturally fall at different times / days and could easily be adjusted to do more on-chain settlement transactions / delay new payment channels if needed to improve cashflow on the hub if needed.


Larger transaction fee would prevent this. With better fee markets and / or software that ignores super-low-fee transactions this would be a non-issue as it would be easy to out-spend the "spam".  The LN settlement transactions would be high-value, so large transaction fees would be perfectly acceptable (and appropriate).


The examples above (mobile phone pay-per-call or streaming video/ audio by the second) could handle thousands or millions of transactions per user via LN.  That is what would raise the average.  More importantly, the on-chain transaction fees would be negligible.  No blocksize increase will ever achieve this level of scalability and no custodian-wallet solution (Coinbase, etc) can match the cryptographic security it provides.
If your argument was that LN would be awkward if we deposit all of our income into it and then try to make on-chain payments, I agree ;-)

@_date: 2015-08-30 08:59:11


In my example of an appropriate use of LN, I used pay-per-second video streaming which would be 3600 transactions per hour.  This could use a 1 hour timeout and result in a much higher average than 100 payments / channel.


Maybe I am missing something, but there is nothing special about "100 payments" is there?  It's just an average – sometimes the channel accumulates 3600 transactions in an hour, sometimes 10.

Note: most older wallets will not recognize Bech32 addresses as valid.  This is probably why [Trezor uses SegWit address embedded in P2SH](  This results in an address starting with `3...` so it looks valid to older wallets and exchanges.
Therefore you should keep a "legacy" wallet for the time being for receiving funds until Bech32 is more common.  Some people here have explored how you can generate `3...` addresses in Electrum, but that is not for noobs  :-)

Empty blocks are just a normal part of Bitcoin mining, they happen when a miner gets lucky in finding a nice before they manage to assemble a block of valid transactions.

A _bitcoin_ is just a convention used by wallets, exchanges, etc. -- that unit doesn't actually exist at the protocol level. It was a way to make the units more understandable at the beginning when exchange values were super low.

Transparency was needed to bootstrap the first decentralized cryptocurrency. In retrospect, it seems transparency and simplicity helped people to trust in the system. The designer didn't know how to do it otherwise (there was discussion of ring signatures, etc). There were various attempts to make Bitcoin more private, but they turned out to be inadequate.
Now we have privacy-focused currencies like Monero and Zcash. Most of the ideas in these altcoins were originally proposed for Bitcoin, but not implemented there.

While LN can use milli-satoshi, the Bitcoin network itself still uses "whole" satoshis to represent value of transactions.  When a channel is closed, the milli-satoshi amounts will simply [be rounded down to the nearest satoshi]( before the tx is constructed and broadcast.

The Bitcoin Core client software stores your keys in a file called [wallet.dat]( which is [encrypted with a password]( using [AES-256-CBC](
NOTE: The Bitcoin **network** uses [ECDSA]( for digital signatures and SHA-256 for hashing.  Contrary to what you will read in many news articles, the Bitcoin network does not use encryption.

Many people discuss embedding data (like a picture) in the Blockchain, but what they actually mean is to create a hash of the file and embed only that in the Blockchain. This provides "proof of existence" that the file in question existed on that day the block was mined.
You still have to store the file somewhere though.

In the video, he seems to be suggesting that real, known people (example is Andreas Antonopoulos) take over a portion of the mining. Presumably PGP would be used to identify these people. Andreas is the only person who owns the PGP key for `DF61E9D9`, so he would only have that one identity in the system. The other people would also need to have a reputation in the Bitcoin community and a well known public key.

Immediate feedback that the transaction was received is an important part of the customer experience. The merchant does not need to ship the product until 6+ confirmations and can cancel the booking / shipment if it doesn't get mined. Assuming good faith makes sense for most transactions because there is plenty of options for recovering from a double-spend in those cases.

Do you input the12 word seed (and regenerate the wallet) every time you want to spend?
This is not necessary with Trezor (only need to use seed if device is broken, lost or stolen).
Regardless, in order to spend from your Electrum wallet, you need to have the keys on a computer, right? That computer *could* have hardware, bios, software keyloggers or other malware. Tails is a multitasking OS, and probably internet connected in your setup... It is much less secure than Trezor which does not allow export of keys / seed ever, doesn't multitask, has no internet, no wireless transmission at all and open firmware.
Now, using Tails like you do is quite safe (especially if you boot from read-only media, never install any new software at all with no persistent storage) and offers decent security, but can you really be 100% sure there is no malware also running? The attack surface is just MUCH smaller with Trezor.
While in the subject, offline-generated, bip38 paper wallets are also quite secure. Completely air-gapped transaction signing ala Armory is also good.
However, all of those are dramatically more cumbersome than Trezor for spending.

There are some serious technical hurdles to overcome before sidechains will be feasible. I've been convinced by people much smarter than myself that sidechains (as currently proposed) will not work.
IMO, it looks more likely that​ off-chain networks like Lightning will "glue" the current heterogenous blockchains together. This seems like the best of both diversity and cooperation.
It seems like only a matter of time before we have a blockchain-agnostic payment routing network. Under the hood, wallets will just negotiate the swaps / HTLC needed to route the payment from a currency you have to that of your recipient following the optimal route. Power​ users could even express preferences for various properties like speed, security, low fees and other criteria which influence the routing decisions.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:34:20
No, it's very different. Nobody should use a closed-source wallet to handle cryptographic material... You have no way to even check what it does.
Light wallets that are open source can be attacked by other network participants, but they can only withhold info about blocks. Not steal money. Very different.
Security is hard, Open Source does not guarantee anything, but it is a basic foundation on which to build a secure wallet. Jaxx fails at this.

Think about this a bit, dividing the existing units into smaller subunits is completely different than creating more units.  Take 21 cookies, break them in half... how many cookies you have now? You can continue breaking your cookies forever, but that doesn't make make more cookies.
Now the so called "deflationary" properties of bitcoin can be a bit confusing... there will only be 21 million (max) ever created, and the rate of creation will be halved every 4 years (until there are none being creates). But many bitcoins will be lost and the **exchange rate** to your fiat currency will vary wildly, so the *spending power* could be inflationary or deflationary... nobody knows.  Given that the rate of release goes down over time, bitcoin is deflationary for amounts denominated in bitcoin.

Those have not caught on... I personally have trouble making sense of wallet balances that try to "help" the user in this way.  I always second guess myself in interpreting how many leading zeros were removed. When we finally get LN, satoshi's will be usable directly, so maybe that will allow us to switch to those units and feel rich :-)
The "named" approach seems better IMHO (like we have for a "satoshi", and also as used in Ethereum for subunits).  
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:35:32
I think this is a decent proposal.
None of these metaphors are really correct, but I personally find "keychain" more useful and accurate than "wallet". HD wallet seed is like a "master key" (or skeleton key).
I don't think the concept single-use (disposable) keys is so hard to get... But there is no reason to even mention these early on.

~~Yes!~~ Kinda.  A  "bitcoin" is [divisible into 100 million subunits]( called "satoshis".  Satoshis are the actual underlying units used in transactions. One satoshi is `0.00000001` bitcoin.
So we can *approximate* 1/3 bitcoin as **33333333 satoshis**.

This is only to replace the *wallet* portion of the reference client (rarely used by individuals these days). This is how Bitstamp was able to offer multisig wallet so quickly after the recent hack.

It was a donation to Mycelium... That is all. Sorry.

Link to [App store]( where the binary is listed as "License: GPLv3" with a link to the Github repository in question.

I was echoing [a comment from Andreas Schildbach]( on the bug above:


I just took a look through the [Violations of the GNU Licenses]( I see this:  


This appears to be a violation, but it would be good to get an Open Source developer to confirm as I do not have experience in this area.

I have not. Was waiting for a response in Github, then posted here on reddit after not hearing anything from developers.  Honestly, the only reason I came across this is because I wanted to improve their software and saw that the file I edited did not match the web wallet.  That was November 20th though.
If you agree the facts documented on Github are in violation of GPLv3 and wish to report, please do so.

Yes, I saw the Chrome extension html, but didn't realize the web wallet html was server-generated, makes sense now looking at the html.  Any plans to make that server-side code available since it's a critical part of the web wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:50:57
So they can still [list the binary as GPLv3]( without having published the source code?  How long would they have to publish the code before being in violation of the license?

I agree, bug reports are not being addressed in a timely manner -- [50 open issues]( many with no response (including 1 [pull request]( from myself) and some bugs over a year old.
- any suggestions on what we can do to make this a bit more of an open, inclusive, responsive process?  Thanks.

When software is claimes to be "Open Source" it means that the code behind the software is available so we can see how it works, what it does and even make new versions if needed.  This is very important when that software controls large amounts of money and / or private information.
This particular Bitcoin Wallet program [assured people it was safe]( partially because it was "Open Source".  Here we are challenging that claim because they launched new versions without telling developers what really changed.  The software could now be doing all kinds of things we don't agree with.  This is an especially important point for the Bitcoin community as you can see :-)

Is it really Open Source?
I am seeing discrepancies between the deployed apps and what is on Github:

I think Vibr8gKiwi was referring to the server-side "[Shared Send]( mixing service code, not the client side "[Shared Coin]( (aka CoinJoin) code you sent.

As of 15 minutes ago updates are being made to the code (first time in 3 months):

Tricky situation, I think they did the right thing by shutting off the pre-orders.  Question is how will they handle the pricing after initial round is shipped?  I am sure they will come up with something reasonable (discounts on 2nd generation devices for those who pre-ordered, etc).

Thanks for updating this zootreeves.


Is the html code that was in the "App-Resources" repo also on Github? Eg, I cannot find this anywhere:
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=" data-toggle="tab"&gt;&lt;i class="icon-random"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Shared Coin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Good to see Chrome extension also updated.
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:14:27
We have the code now, all is good.
Chrome extension and Android wallet are safer than web wallet, but definitely research other options for large amounts of BTC.

Code was out of sync in multiple repos for months and bugs for this were being ignored - please check github for yourself.  
Blockchain.Info's credibility + security of its users depends on Open Source code. I'd like to know how they simply "forgot" something so critical?
What will change going forward?  
To their credit, they responded very fast after this post, but IMO this should not  have been necessary.
It's great software used by a large portion of the Bitcoin community -- but "with great power comes great responsibility".
