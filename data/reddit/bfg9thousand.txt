Its a fork meaning that bch cloned the blockchain on august 1st for their coin.  This means all wallets and amounts also cloned, thus your money.

Bitcoin is the definition of free market.. you think some gov entity is going to be handing out free btc to impoverished people??? Lol! Wheres that btc coming from?  How is it being replenished?

That is true ONLY if you are married (combined income less than 77k) AND you held your capital for more than a year before selling...

Agreed.  Its pure speculation, it will have some influence ofc but not much.  I think it will push more people to buy real btc tho
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:10:02
17k actually.  If you had 1 btc before bch fork, you could sell your btc and bch right now for 20k.  Exact same thing that was possible when btc was 9k and bch 1k..

Hardware wallets are pretty awesome.  Trezor or Ledger.  Trezor ~125 USD, Ledger ~60 USD.  Both are secure and update with new alt-coin support frequently.  Theres also a lot of good wallet clients like Electrum.  Whatever you use make sure its Segwit compatible!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:53
you need limit buys in these situations
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:04:56
if the cashed out 6k is worth more than it would have been when you bought, then I believe you do owe.  Say you cashed out .3 btc at 6k: if when you bought 1 btc was worth 9500, than .3 btc was worth ~ 3k when you bought.  Meaning that you would be taxed on that 3k profit 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:47:37
You could buy on coinbase with a debit card, 500$ max i think tho.  And fee is 4% i think.
Other than that once you are verified, bank transfer to coinbase (takes about a week) transfer again to gdax (instant) and then buy buybuy at 0.3% fee, limit orders no fee 
Also you could buy at a bitcoin atm if theres any in your area 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:53

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:31:34
it tells you when you signup that their fees are nearly 4%.  Thats why everyone transfers to GDAX (coinbase exchange)- where you can buy for minimal fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:49
Yes.  So wouldnt that mean the CME consensus will be split 50/50?  Or would it be averaged one way or the other? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:18:24

Your wallet is stored on the Blockchain.  That is a record of every transaction, every wallet, everything, back to the beginning.  So, its engrained in the blockchain

@_date: 2017-12-12 01:13:31
Fees are much lower on gdax compared to coinbase.  
Say you buy 5k of btc on coinbase, fees are roughly 4%. Thats 200$ in fees
Same trade on gdax would be ~20-60$ in fees depending on traffic
Also gdax is no wait whereas coinbase is usually a wait time 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:13

Yea there could be major players longing as well.  
In the video of Andreas he said "for there to be a short there must also be a long of the same value", something like that.  So wouldnt that mean the concensus will be split 50/50 and its up to the market (people with actual btc) ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:25:59
Ive been reading a lot that if your using a crypto-crypto trading platform, your funds might be stored in a foreign account (binance) and thus you have to file a FBAR thing.  Do you know anything about this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:43:04
im not sure.  maybe your supposed to verify your account before you can transfer out?  I wouldn't worry too much, Coinbase is the biggest exchange in the US, they just opened phone support lines also you should call them
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:43:21
I mean not even announcing that the coin was going live a few days before hand??? I get they announced it was coming 6 months ago but still.  Seems like this was not just some Conbase employees but the whole organization conspiring to take out btc 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:38

If your transferring from your bank, yea it takes about a week
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:29:14
Its a really tough call.  Will both coins combined value be greater or equal to btc's value pre-fork?  
Imo if btc wins during this, its value increases.  If b2x wins who knows wtf will happen (it prob wont be good).  
Safest thing would be to sell prefork and buy back in when the dust settles.

They will not both be 7k upon release of the fork.... b2x futures were at .14 of btc last i heard.  And since theres no replay protection, one coin is going to zero.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:35:47
Why is that? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:34:51
