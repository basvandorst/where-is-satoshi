Welcome to Microsoft rollouts. It's always US only, then select markets and then global launch.

Yep, mine an altcoin. Everyone and their cat is trying to mine Bitcoin for obvious reasons. You'd definitely need an ASIC miner at this point to be effective.

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but does this entail buying apps with Bitcoin? If so, holy shit crackers! 
@_date: 2014-12-13 22:03:56
Fucking seriously. 
Windows Phone market share in the US isn't very high, yes; but in other countries in Europe and India and the likes, the platform is only second to android. Countries where Bitcoin adoption is happening or countries where Bitcoin can thrive (developing nations) Windows Phone is being adopted there and will be there, along with android and maybe ios in the margins. Let alone the fact this is a platform where the company the develops the software and hardware officially stands for Bitcoin, there needs to be growth for Bitcoin related apps for Windows Phone. 
Just as Bitcoin has been naysaid for not being a legal/legitimate currency, it's not going to be a adopted, it's a fad that's going to be consumed by PayPal or Visa; the very similar is said of Windows Phone. It's not a mature platform, no one has one or wants one, and it's going to be absorbed by android with the remnants taken by ios. But what part of either is actually true? Those are what the naysayers claim. 
Basically, Bitcoin and Windows Phone are two underdogs that are staged to make huge impacts on the world and their respective categories and already have been doing so. Windows Phone isn't a platform to ignore, especially not going forward with Universal code and Windows 10 where a single Bitcoin app will have exposure on Windows Phones, Windows PCs, and even Xbox Ones.

So the two suggestions out there are to use paper backups or use Linux? Really? Not, use the best internet security suite out there as well as paper backups OR use a platform totally different than Windows, some of which are peer reviewed and can allow potential hackers to pour over the source code for flaws. I'm not here to say Linux or Windows is terrible than the latter, but switching OSs before even ACTUALLY putting in the effort to secure off the one you're using first seems too drastic. Guarantee you, if Linux becomes a requirement to use Bitcoin wallets etc, it won't take off among everyone else.

How do we balance national security and indivdual privacy? Simple, let's look at the data in the past decade or so of the PATRIOT ACT and let us all see what it prevented. It was found out that it was about 54 terror plots foiled, yet many still slipped through. Boston bombings? Could have been prevented but wasn't. Countless shootings in recent years? If the NSA was elaborate enough and actually was using this whole PRISM thing for national security, those would have been prevented. 

No matter how far a government's reach into individual liberties are, things WILL still fall through the cracks. I can bet the reason why the government is so butthurt about all this info being released into the wild is now anyone that is REALLY dedicated enough can use exploits in the PRISM system; such as, oh hey, inventing a new language and using a lot of offline tactics. The NSA can intercept your communications, but they will have no damn idea what they'll be reading.

My question is, how is Bitcoin a better alternative in general? It's a currency and can and will experience extremes as we all saw last year. 
Also, the concern I have is, stemming from some comments here, that BTC to USD is more stable than BTC to the Ruble. If Bitcoin's stability comes from a fiat concurrency, that kind of makes it more as a digital USD vessel currency than an ACTUAL standalone currency. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:45:27
That's typical Microsoft. US only for a while, global launch later.

@_date: 2014-05-05 16:18:24
The thing that happens when your digital currency exceeds the value of a USD by extremes, that's when the initial fun stops. Instead of literally having tipping wars in the comments, it turns into freaking out about using Windows to run a wallet client and how dreadfully insecure it is. Bitcoin is cool and all, but it's not fun anymore. 

Dogecoin is fun and no one really cares about the value of it and that in itself is why it doesn't get seriously. A bajillion Dogecoins means nothing, only what you get in return...which would be a motherfuckign NASCAR! That's so cool! :D

There's also the fact in the latest Visual Studio, you can kind of make android apps as well as Windows apps.

Because mobile Bitcoin payment or ATMs are simple to use...
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:27:38
I could go either way on this. Even though something happens, like Microsoft accepting Bitcoin payment, it's yet another, "THIS IS IT YOU GUYS!!" In reality, not so much. ATMs are difficult to use, no universal singular cross-platform app and no infrastructure support to use Bitcoin daily without special vendors or lengthy work arounds. It's a good idea but with flaws. Mining it isn't even a question, and I wonder if the electrical consumption of it is sustainable. I also question off-line support as well. Bitcoin is far from being mainstream. It's also not near being labeled a fad. But a lot of attention swarmed around it simply because of the cash value of it and now that's dissipated, what's left? A digital currency with no insurance or FDIC backing that makes buying and selling a tad more difficult to do just to stick it to the current system with the idea it'll take over the world. Could be another Dogecoin, could be something major...
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:20:40

You kind of are. Asking a developer to design something beyond rudimentary UI design is asking a bit much. Developers stereotypically don't push for lush design, they push for code stability and usability. I agree, developers need to stop neglecting design. It doesn't help progress anything when banking apps are better designed than Bitcoin apps are. If an app seems difficult to use or looks difficult, that's where we have issues.

TL;DR of Bitcoins, value is assigned to numbers on a screen. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:17:36
Snarky comment but you're asking developers to focus on design. That right there is an oxymoron as developers (especially the Linux devs/open source devs) focus on making the program work versus making it look nice and modern. That's why we have designers.

The disadvantage of Linux is that not every program will work out of the gate on every distro. Develop a Bitcoin wallet client app on Ubuntu, doesn't work on DSL, etc. 
Windows (versions above 7) has a system wide SmartScreen filter as well as in IE (versions above 8). All downloads are filtered to check if it's legit or not. 
Windows Store contains peer reviews on all apps, both Win32 and WinRT coded apps. WinRT apps are reviewed for malware or other illegal calls in the code. Win32 apps need to have their installer .exe file to be digitally signed among other requirements before it's allowed onto the Store. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:48:22
I like Windows too and don't care to switch to Linux and learn mostly everything I know on the software front just to evade probably a 0.000000000000000056% chance of being hacked out of nowhere.

People say you "can" mine with just the CPU, but in reality, no. There was a .gif in r/funny yesterday of a dog digging in a bathtub while the water was running, this is a perfect example of CPU mining. Both Bitcoin mining and altcoin mining with a CPU are like going out to a lake and fish with a shotgun. You might be able to catch something, but in the end, it probably wasn't worth it.

Are you SERIOUSLY keeping Bitcoins on Windows xp? 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:34:59
This is my thoughts exactly with Linux distros. Someone could engineer a backdoor into a popular distro that is used by Bitcoin miners and no one could even know it's there, only to be exploited by one person. How do I know if peer reviewed source code has been thoroughly checked? 
And I do agree, if someone is dedicated enough they will hack into your system regardless of mechanisms in place. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:10:52
I know about the tiff exploit, it's rare for something like a .tiff file to be used for system attacks. 
One of the problems of Windows ARE its users. It doesn't matter if you're on mac os, Ubuntu, or Windows; a system is only as secure as the user that made it so. If you can't keep simple safeguards in place, you losing Bitcoins is something you should blame yourself. 
That's just fact of Windows 8.1. Sorry if stating fact makes me a salesman, but that's the way it is. 
Oy, I stated like three things before the security suite suggestion. Disable features that aren't to be used, disable NIC functions like IPv6 if not used, disable services that are set to manual to prevent something from penetrating though one of those services, AND use an internet security suite that has a firewall and anti-virus, maybe even something like an ad block feature as well. 
Regardless of platform, there WILL be security flaws to be exploited. Linux has them, mac has them, but what the two have in common are that most users NEVER use anti-virus software or a separate firewall and say, "You don't really need that because the usage of mac os and/or Linux distros is so small compared to Windows, no one will hack those platforms!" Yeah, someone might be more inclined to hack a Linux distro that's being commonly used for Bitcoin miners than Windows or mac os. It's a concise attack that targets what a hacker would want to target which are your Bitcoins. 
Think about that for a while.

The wrong advice is to buy an NVIDIA card to mine. You'll be fucked. Also, plunking 1,000+ dollars for a mining rig. That shit is kind of stupid because you can buy a BTC and a half with that money and you're guaranteed a Bitcoin and a half. Also, going all out for ASIC miners. Again, same reason as before. 
Now if you already have an AMD based gaming rig, you could mine BTC but that's the wrong advice at this point in time. It's too much in the spotlight and everyone is trying to get a piece of it. The right advice is to mine altcoins, like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin, etc. and swap them over to BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:29:02
This is all exaggerated if you're not on xp. As I said, if you're Bitcoining with Windows xp, you're an idiot for many reasons like, why the hell are you using modern hardware on an antiquated operating system? Or, do you not realize xp's security safeguards are like a whore's vagina? 
If you're on xp and your Bitcoins get stolen, that is your fault only for being so stupid. Cash out a 100 some dollars worth and buy yourself a new operating system. Holy crap

The question you're asking is, "Why would anyone else not want to use android?" It's all about options and diversifying. And that's also to say that licensing fees for Windows Phone (and Windows 8.1 RT) won't be dropped to combat that. Microsoft-Nokia will be focusing aggressively on lower end handsets that have done well in India, like the 520 and 525, as well as changing some of the design to allow for even less expensive devices. As of yet, Microsoft has nothing to say about Bitcoining. The idea is that as Bitcoin grows in developing markets as a great alternative to fiat currencies, so will market share of Windows Phone and android. ios is obviously out of the game. The fact is, not everyone will or want to use android. The fact os, FireFox OS or Ubuntu Mobile will be able to gain enough traction in time to be fully worthwhile to develop for, just ask Microsoft on how easy it is to release a new mobile platform. Also, there are a few apps that have been published on both Windows and Windows Phone Stores pertaining to Bitcoin from mining to managing your wallet. Both apps have yet to be removed. I ask that everyone to look at usage trends of Windows Phone, usage trends in certain areas of the world with Bitcoin, and make the decision for yourself on what is worth it. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:23:01
You say that as if it's the golden key to security. 
Meanwhile at Microsoft...
A 1,000 people AT LEAST review and test the code on a daily basis before sent out to ship. Then probably countless more people review the operating system and some security firms even see what holes can be poked and send those results to Microsoft for them to resolve. Many people along the way have incomes they can lose if they don't get this right from the code development to end user deployment.
What you're describing with Linux is Microsoft.

Well, if you think about it, why is Dogecoin so popular? Unlike here on /bitcoin, there isn't this feeling of seriousness that you'd expect to see from Wall Street traders at the end of the day. Dogecoin is just a fun joke that may or may not go anywhere, that's the point of it. It's not taken so damn seriously and therefore people new to cryptocurrency can get a better start with Dogecoin and BTC or LTC because the community is more light spirited and that shit just makes me giggle like a little girl everytime I go through that subreddit! :D

The thing I'm iffy about with android is the fact malware can be prevalent even in the google play store. That's concerning as is, let alone doing any kind of mobile banking or bitcoining. It's the only mobile platform that has anti-malware software for it.... 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:46:56
I'll add onto this some more. If you're using Windows based on the NT 6 kernel (vista, 7, 8, 8.1) the likelyhood of malware attacks and actual remote hacking are incredibly slim. How many of you here have done STD removal from these systems? 

The vast majority of malware these days will do one of few things: prevent access to AV, Task Manager, and other system programs; in the case of cyptolockers, hold your hard drive for randsom; or the usual slowing of your system. Except for cryptolocker (that is easily avoidable) you're not going to get data stolen from you. There is a reason why the NT 6 kernel was used in part for security, it's VASTLY superior than the NT 5 kernel with xp. There is a reason why NT 6 system use more system resources as they're running a good list of security based services as well as more networking services than NT 5.

There are bits out there that DO actual harm, but again, a good internet security suite will catch most of that before it hits you. Those security companies HAVE to update their products everyday to update the virus list. It's just way too difficult for the common hacker to do much harm on Windows these days, as why social engineering tactics are being used to lead the user into a trap. 

Again, IF YOU'RE ON WINDOWS XP AND YOU HAVE BITCOINS ON YOUR SYSTEM, GET THE HELL OFF XP!! That's the HUGEST insecurity on Windows right now. You're possibly going to screw yourself over in about four months. I don't care how you get updated to something beyond xp (and vista), just do it. Pirate it, I don't care, Microsoft will at least be glad marketshare is dwindling for xp.

Ummm, I don't know where you get the notion Microsoft educated or mis-educated users. They've even said a few times that Windows Defender in 8 is meant for base line protection and recommend a separate anti-virus. They're always the ones that harp about keeping things in order on your PC, but that falls on deaf ears more than anything. 
What software is dangerous in Windows that someone who mines/exchanges Bitcoin would have that wouldn't be just as dangerous on Linux? The fact that there is very little third party companies developing software for Linux can mean that someone can poke a hole or take advantage of a software exploit on Linux. 
This is the same as in Windows, don't need a feature, untick the box, hit apply, restart. With system services, that requires some knowledge of course, but it's not like needing to know what -sudo is or other system functions like that. 
Debian without networking defeats the purpose of Bitcoining. I can do just the same with Windows. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:04:16
There is a separation of user space and the system, you don't run your user account as the built in admin account that can effectively destroy the system if you don't know what you're doing. There are different tiers of user accounts, none of which use the main system admin account. That is ONLY used in rare scenarios. 
Programs should run when you click on them, you need to explain that a bit better. 
There is an integrated update system for Windows, device drivers, and some software through Windows Update. Program updates for third party software isn't integrated and should be, but this has been done with WinRT.
I think your conception of Windows dates back before NT 5.... I don't see how some of these things pertain to modern Windows. 
This is why Microsoft built the WinRT coding environment to not apps to have deep level system access is BECAUSE of the flaws in the Win32 structure. No, the base of Windows wasn't developed for modern usage, as why there is now a turnover that they want to see from Win32 to WinRT. UAC doesn't stop everything, but that was designed as a nuisance to the user to bring attention to them. The fact is that the common user doesn't understand what .dll is or .exe or -sudo or even what UAC is half the times. This is the problem, LACK of understand of what they're doing/using.

Reading through the comments here, this is WAY too exaggerated. There are 0 day exploits, but Microsoft when aware of such will usually always patch them if they're critical flaws. If there are security patches that need to be released, they do release them outside of Patch Tuesday, Windows Update installs them and if required it demands you restart your PC right away. 

There was research done by HP and another company that found an astonishing rate of security holes, 8/10, are from third party applications being poorly coded. 

The words of wisdom that have been around since the days of Windows xp reign true today.

-Keep your shit up to date. Don't keep Windows Update on manual, leave it on automatic. 

-Ideally, keep your Windows version up to date. If you're Bitcoining on Windows xp, you sir are an imbecile. Windows xp's security abilities are like throwing a hot dog down a hall way, it's uttery terrible for security and networking. Don't use it. Windows 7 is better, ideally Windows 8.1 is going to be better for many reasons such as: code Microsoft is more keen on keeping up to date, Windows Store app reviews for both WinRT and desktop Win32 reviews along with security verifications/qualifications being met, and WAY better for security. 

-Use an internet security suite, not just an anti-virus. Windows Defender and Firewall are meant mostly as basic protection, you NEED a decent security suite. Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 and BitDefender are the top two rated suites in terms of malware discovery/filtering. 

-Keep in mind that more than anything, YOU individually won't be attacked by remote hackers. I don't know what your Bitcoin value is, I don't know you, why would I target just you? It takes a little more than what you'd think to remotely hack someone somewhere in the world. Yes, I could create a virus that uses an exploit on Windows 7, but doesn't really work on Windows 8.1 because more people use 7 than 8.1. 

-There are some articles out there on how to "harden" Windows against things like this. Disable features you don't use, turn off networking features of your NIC adapter like IPv6 if not used, and disable services (primarily anything remote access) that you don't ever use. The concept is that you're reducing the plane size of possible infilitration of the platform. Turning off Remote Assisstance reduces the possibility of remote hacking. Disabling features is like walling up a doorway to attackers.

-Use cold storage regardless of platform

Basically, don't be an idiot on the internet. Some of the comments here are so over the top I challenge someone to hack me because they're that outrageous. If someone can hack into Citi bank's servers or hack Target credit card pins, there is little you can do against that regardless of platform. Linux might have a better shot of withstanding that if you use like Mint or something like that, but to switch platforms like that JUST for that very small off chance? It's more overhyped concern. 

I've yet to read something that is of actual concern on the Windows platform security wise.
