Porn sites, for example. Why isn't  the adult film industry speaking out against this? They'll gladly stand up for trans people in NC -not that that isn't an honorable thing to do-, but they won't try to protect their paying customers?

I just think it's more abdication of liability. When you tell people to secure their money, they go "IT'S TOO HARD! WHY CAN'T SOMEONE ELSE DO IT?". At some point people are going to have to be responsible for themselves in all ways.
EDIT: perhaps I used the wrong term. I meant to say "Liability". The thing about fiat is that it is insured if it gets stolen, the bank catches fire, there is a flood, etc. Banks are designed to store your fiat and if something happens, the bank is liable for the damage. With Bitcoin, the liability falls to you, the buyer. If something happens, you are on the hook for it. Bitcoin has no FDIC to reimburse you if there is a robbery, fire, or flood. Not many people want to accept that kind of liability. They just aren't ready.

So, what I'm getting from this is that mining is a gamble. Since miners have no way of knowing which nonce will provide a hash with the required number of leading zeroes, so they just keep making hashes with different nonces until they find one that works. It's not so much a wager, as a race, since you're competing with other miners to find it first.
Now, I wonder if I can't place bets on miners.

Well, to solve that they trap you in a box once you wake up so that you know there is a problem, you know something must be done about it, but you can't do anything for fear of losing everything. Your job, your house, your family, your friends. They put you in a box made of all the things you least want to hurt, so you can't break out.

Many people, myself included, just aren't ready for that kind of sacrifice. Of my body, and my time, sure I can give. But of my family? Of my friends? No. My job? Jobs come and go, same with material possessions. But if fighting the fight means putting my family on the street, I don't think they would ever forgive me.

This is a big reason why Trump is gaining ground. It's because people are tired of their young liberal acquaintances calling them bigots. They hate hearing cries for "safe spaces" on college campuses. They are normal, working class Americans who don't want to be priced out of a job. And they feel like Trump is actually listening to their concerns, while Clinton and the Democratic Party just dismisses them.

I'm a little jealous if this is true. I always wanted to get into mining. I don't even need that many coins, I would be happy if I only ever mined 2-3 BTC at this point. I even have a desktop and laptop I could use if I had software. What's the current hashrate, anyway?

I meant that the science isn't fully understood by me, but it seems like a good way to store your BTC for millennia. I don't get how "oligonucelotide synthesis machines" work. Now, after reading a few articles on the subject, writing ones BTC to DNA seems like a bad idea, because of polymerase chain reaction, which as I understand it, allows you to create copies of DNA, so it would fuck up the blockchain if I made copies of 1BTC, and only that one BTC.

HODL is an acronym that means "Hold On for Dear Life". HODLers believe in holding on to every BTC they acquire, regardless of market fluctuations, in the hope that one day, it will become a standard currency, rather than a tradeable commodity to invest in.

True. It does seem being anti-PC will only carry you so far, but it's not like Hillary Clinton is much better. She outwardly professes a belief in equal pay, yet of the 11 highest paid members of the Clinton Foundation, only 3 are women, and they make $190k/yr less than the men.
And that's just one example of her being two-faced.  Those Podesta emails say more than the media ever could.

And yes, DNA data storage does exist. I don't fully understand the science, but it consists of imprinting data into artificially made DNA, which can then be read through a DNA sequencer.

One caveat with Coinbase is the fact that they track what you buy from them. Let's say I buy 1BTC on Coinbase. I move it from their vault to my own private wallet on my machine. It used to be that they would only track for one transaction. Now, they follow all the way. If I spend any part of that BTC, they will know. And, depending on who I transacted with, they can decide whether or not they want to ban me from buying BTC through them ever again.
