Exactly. But since everything seems to be working fine we will be out of beta soon.

Ah, I see. Just changed that so it doesn't jump to the top after clicking the link.

I'm not sure if this works, but will have a look. Thanks for posting the links.

I just started  You bet on multiple odds at once and can win 2.25x, 22.5x or 100x your bet. Winnings are sent back within 20 seconds and all bets are fully transparent and fair. 
Comments and suggestions are appreciated!

Please see section "3. Verify that we're playing fair" on our website. There you'll find all the information to prove that bets are handled in a fair way. As soon as the secret for a day is published you can reconstruct the lucky numbers and payouts. 
Let me know if there's anything wrong with this as I want this to be transparent and reproducible.

You can always look up your transaction at blockchain.info. In addition, there will be a section on our website soon, this will be up within one week.

We just started out and have limited funds. To guarantee payouts, we have a lower max bet. We will raise this over time.

Seems to be working for me as well, just loaded my bitcointip account and tested it.

Have not considered this yet, but that's an interesting idea. Will have a look at the sites, thanks.
