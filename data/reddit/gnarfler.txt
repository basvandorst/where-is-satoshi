You'd need to set up your checking account on gdax then deposit usd on the exchange, if it gets that low and the transaction goes through you get your clearance btc. 
Not sure how long it'll take though. Sooner you get liquid the better though.

On gdax you can only deposit with your checking account or wire transfer. Wire transfer takes too long and is a bad idea. You won't be able to deposit usd into gdax with a debit card.

Yo this ain't about fiat, ok?  This is about a redistribution of wealth. A global currency, being your own bank; where value can't be manipulated by governments or institutions.  Go back to fiat if you want but this is bigger than profits.

Yeah let's swing down about 4K long enough for coinbase to let's us by more before it goes up again.

What be enough btc to justify ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:24:40
-Massive amount-
Dudes gotta choose what exchange. Probably gdax and set a limit order.  Like .02 every day or so if it's a truly massive amount. Then if it does dip go all in.

Hmm maybe I will consider going through with purchasing some alt coins on kraken if this works out well.

Yeah under 8k seems like a good time to DCA.  I've got an amount set aside in case of a bigger dip though. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:19:41
What's your target then?  Your best guess at the lowest dip?  Btw I agree my target is unrealistic

I'm getting a hardware wallet soon. When I transfer my btc to the wallet will coinbase charge my btc or can I pay those fees in usd?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:31:17
Yeah my target is 6500 but that might be out of the question or wishful thinking.  Still gunna DCA though.

Today a coworker, who got me into  bitcoin, said I should also get some litecoin. Now this news happens and I'm even more intrigued. 
How is Ltc different from btc?  Where can I find this answer myself? Should I expect litecoin's value to be different/less than bitcoin? Do they serve different purposes?
If you can answer or push me in a direction where I can find these answers I'd appreciate it, thanks.

If we can come up with 167k or 19 btc I think we could do something better than a few seconds of super bowl air time.

Hey thank you for responding. Good to know about the difference between the two. I'll check out bitfinex too. I've been watching the depth chart more than the candle chart. Are there any shapes on the depth chart that indicate future trends?  Also does the depth chart show actual buy/sells, orders, and/or both?  Again thanks for your kind response.

Why you expect it to plummet?
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:59:24
Cause Bitcoin is going down down down
