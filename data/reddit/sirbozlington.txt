You know here is no underlying fundamental value of BTC right? It is just as useful/valuable at 5k as it is at 5c. Just behavioural psychology at work, like you with an attachment to any buys you’ve made in the past, you think 5k is a buy. Many more like you doing the same thing may support somewhat at that price.

*ding* assume the brace position

You are probably right, will likely be lower than $4,000 for a long time.

So you’ve lost like $100k in the last month?

At $0.10 then you could buy all coins for $1.7m. There will be a lot more money than that in bitcoin for a long time. I agree with you a death spiral will hit a floor but I think that floor is much higher, maybe $1000 given the worldwide exposure in bitcoin and there will always be people dabbling in it.

All might not be profitable now, but in time the least profitable will be turned off, bitcoins mined per Mwh will increase and balance will eventually be restored right? It just an economics question that will eventually again reach equilibrium right?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:41:09
That is my point.But I think we are already in the death spiral and the floor might be $1000. The difference with the stocks you mentioned is that their underlying cashflow forecasts changed as the companies collapsed. In bitcoin’s case it is purely behavioural. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:10:42
Won’t some miners leave as they are no longer profitable making the computations easier which then increases the profitability from mining for the miners left? This restores the balance. Sure there are less miners crunching numbers though which impacts the time for transaction verification. 
Doesn’t the technology have this sort of equilibrium feature built in where the computation required is always around the marginal cost of production? I don’t know too much about blockchain so happy to learn otherwise.

wow. I had a chuckle over that. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:42:59
How much have you put in? Rational move I think to get out with a fair bit rather than risk it all disappearing.

People buy bitcoin just like they buy shares. But shares have dividends that are paid to those owners each year as dividends. The net present value of all those forecast future dividends is what it is valued at in today’s dollars. Apple will be owners of shares money every year in those dividends. Bitcoin owners get zero. Hence it’s fundamental value is zero. Only worth something because of a misconception by people that it has value. If they stop believing that then bitcoin will free fall, similar to what we have been seeing for the last year.

My two cents. 
Bitcoin has no underlying value and so its value is 100% based on sentiment and bid/ask market dynamics. Large buy/sell orders move the price and as there is no underlying value the price has no reason to return to a fundamental value and so the price sticks.  
As it is based on sentiment then it is all behavioural economics that drives this price and as it is only the large orders that move the market then it is only the behaviour of those large orders that counts. They consist of people who lots of bitcoin early, miners and manipulators. He first two I think understand that these current prices may never be seen again. As the value is still fairly significant (not low enough to just say bugger it I’ll hold) they are making their way for the exits while they can still get a big enough layout to have a good life. This leads to big sell orders. He manipulators excentuate this and make money by following and compounding the downward trend. 
As there is no underlying value I think the floor will be the point where that behaviour changes. Where the price is so low the big whales and miners basically have nothing to lose by holding and hoping for a rebound. At this point buyers may fill in hoping for a similar run up as we had in 2017. If I had to take an absolute stab in the dark I would say $1,000 might be in that region, about 5% of the ATH. At that point a portfolio that was once worth $18m would be worth $1m and the holder has not much to gain by selling but may hope for better times ahead. I also think this is a physiological floor that may attract buyers. This may stop the free fall. 
All just my opinion and applying a bit of economic logic to a market driven purely by behaviour. Let me know your thoughts.

Guessing, but it is the only explanation. Either someone wanting to get out fast, or serious market manipulation.

Someone just sold thousands of bitcoin in the last hour. Tens of millions of dollars worth which sucked up the whole bid order book. Now we are getting this weird action as the order book fills back in.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:33:25
Agree, if you had that many you wanted to get rid of you would do it over days/weeks. If this is market manipulation then it is very very expensive to do. Have to have a lot that you sell, and now that the price has rebounded they won't be able to buy back in slowly at a price lower than their average sell price, meaning that at the moment it looks like they would loose money doing this. Very strange. Someone might have just lost a lot of money.
