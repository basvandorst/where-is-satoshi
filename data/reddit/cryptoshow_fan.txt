I feel your pain.  I get behind sometime too.  Tell them hi next time you see them for me.

Original LTB gave the CSW a voice, Cryptoshow just had someone else talk about it.

Don't forget the one with Kim DotCom, and Richard Binney (NSA whistlblower), Ladar Levinson (lavabit), they even got an r/bitcoin moderator one time.

They didn't have CSW on, they just had someone who wasn't even at the conference talking about what he said.  We already know CSW won't go on the show.  He was very clear about that.
"So I'm going to do this once, and once only, I'm going to come in front of the camera once, and I will never ever be on the camera ever again, for any TV station, or any media, ever."
 
Keep in mind, the Original headline show aired the entire speech verbatim.
Craig, if you are reading this, I'm sure the crypto show would gladly have you as a guest, even if it does annoy this subreddit.
But as for your original comment, I'm confused, how do you know it is the most interesting if you don't listen?

You seem to have me confused with someone else.
I don't remember the episode you are referring to, but it is funny that is the example you use, rather than any of the other jokes in poor taste.  Vitalik did indeed grow up in Russia for 6 years, and has Russian citizenship.
They have brought on Anthony Diorio and Jonathan Mohan, both Ethereum co-founders in the past.

So when Roger is being debated on the show by Johnny at Blockstream it is great, but when he can spare a quick minute to talk about something amazing that had happened a day or two before, its "get the pitchforks!"?
Listening closely to the latest episode, I could swear that I heard in the background where Roger was literally making someone cry.  You may be onto something.

It is a RADIO show, not a podcast.  Be glad that they cut out the commercials that local Austin audience hears.
Here is a sample, but with many fewer commercials than goes out over the air:  
Be glad you are not hearing about Startpage, Dr. Kathryne Albright, the latest supplements Alex Jones is pushing, the Lonestar Lowdown, etc.
They have no control over the commercial break.

It is easy to criticize, but the original LTB tried doing a show twice a week and they couldn't sustain it.  Pinky and the Brain have been doing this twice a week for years, as a hobby, with deadlines measured in seconds, for your enjoyment. 
If you have an interesting guest that wants to be on the show, have them contact the host.

The article doesn't mention his Cryptoshow nickname: **Scrooge McAltcoin**.
The next show he is on he talks about how Bitcoin is like the Matrix.  I have a different take that analogy:
A computer security expert repeatedly travels to Sydney with a team of specialists to battle bureaucrats in the existing power structures.  His secret is known to the bureaucrats, but the countless Sydneyites around him are oblivious to how their lives are controlled by the power structures.  He battles fiercely to free them from the existing power structures.
