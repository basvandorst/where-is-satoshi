Have you tried contacting businesses listed on coinmap.org? There are several ones close to the center of Athens. Most likely that the owners wouldn't mind having a two-way BTM housed on their property if their business accepts bitcoin payments.

Well, it's actually a "digital storage" that allows you to "avoid volatility" by converting your bitcoins to entirely virtual FIAT currencies, Silver and Gold. 
They [claim to own real gold]( to "back up their reserves" but [meanwhile...](
That also applies to the 'FIAT' you can convert your bitcoins to. **Bitcoin in and bitcoin out service only**

The first one started less than a week ago. I found out about it from the operator's postings in bitcointalk.org in the greek subforum. 
As of btcgreece.com, it's been up and running without problems for months. Exchanges don't need to be listed on bitcoin.org to be considered legit.

I live in Greece. Not using credit cards in Greece is largely a choice. It's not cultural, or *fear of technology* as you describe it. 
First of all, it's inconvenient. Credit cards for Greek retailers is like bitcoin to the Californian ones. Mostly certain types of stores accept them; It'd be nearly impossible to find an area where all stores you need to shop from on a regular basis were nearby. Aside of that, VAT here is 23%, I've known retailers that outright refuse to accept CC payments because they think 23% is already too unproductive for their business to top it off with any other sort of fee. 
As of bitcoin, you're partly right. However, nearly all people I've talked to about bitcoin found it an interesting concept. Still unlikely to use it though. Mostly because of the amount of dedication it wold require.

Are you yet to understand that zerohedge is nothing more than FUD? 
I live in Greece, there's no mention about the banks being close to collapse by any media channel here. This article is pure speculation, and provides zero factual evidence to support the claim that banks here are "on the verge of total collapse".

Your comment is (surprisingly) accurate. I see a lot of misconceptions by people posting here. And to be honest, I wouldn't blame them. The commentary of the mass media isn't particularly helpful, rather misleading I would say.

Well, exiting the monetary union and devaluing the new Greek currency would theoretically be a solution to debt. The result of such actions are dubious at best though. 
Realistically speaking, bitcoin as it is wasn't designed to be the national currency of any country and probably will never be. 
What many bitcoiners are referring to when saying that bitcoin could help Greeks is probably an implication that it could be used as an alternative currency while co-existing with whatever local FIAT currency. 
An increase of the userbase is what many here are looking for, maybe what most have in mind when connecting bitcoin with Greece is the events in Cyprus that helped bitcoin receive attention from the mainstream media. 
The idea that bitcoin has any sort of presence in Greece is nothing but a fallacy though. The financial Crisis has been tormenting the country since 2008, still the few and tiny Greek bitcoin communities have only been shrinking since 2013 and the use cases are nothing more than amateurs and hobbyists.

Not that I watch any of those regularly, but zerohedge tries to keep being an underground source for news. They protect the anonymity of their authors and nearly each piece there is an opinionated article that has gone through very little fact checking.

Acharnes? Why choose this area? 
It sounds like such an odd choice if you're Greek. Acharnes (also known as Menidi) has been considered an area of the poor for nearly two decades now. It's one of the least densely populated areas in the entire Attica, full of immigrants and gypsies. It's one of the very few areas in Attica where you can still find property than nothing has been built on.
It's also really inconvenient to access the area if you are near any other city center like Athens or Piraeus.

Thanks for replying, I do know that there have been many attempts. None of which are receiving funding from the one bitcoin foundation. And that's kind of the point I was trying to make. In my opinion, saying that bitcoin.org came to be the top website because of the free market's selection is unfair. 
The foundation's funding played a crucial role into its development aside of the fact that they don't control the content. It would be harder for anyone to develop something competing out of pure good will or under a for-profit model.

I wouldn't say that most retailers refuse to accept CC payments solely because of that, but yeah... With a 23% VAT, tax avoidance has been part of Greek retail despite all the efforts of the government. 


In theory, maybe. But I don't think anyone would be interested to promote bitcoin use to the Greek general public because it's convenient for tax avoidance.

Bitcoin XT, as a full node of a supposed network, would also have the responsibility to detect double spending attacks and reject them. 
Quote from **5.2** *Double-Spending of Zero-Confirmation Transactions.*


analysis in [17], an enhanced version of Bitcoin, referred
to as Bitcoin XT [3], currently broadcasts the first double-spend
transaction in the network. This allows a vendor to observe any
double-spending attempt for an upcoming payment, and to consequently
deny the processing of a fast payment.
I kind of find it frustrating that your comment was upvoted to be the top one. Sort of highlights how much redditors like to base their opinions solely on titles.

Most websites in the clearnet at least try to remove user-generated content that is illegal. Ross did absolutely nothing about this, this wasn't what Silk Road was about. 
Now if you want to talk clearnet sites, there are much worse examples than craigslist. There are ponzi schemes, money laundering services, credit card marketplaces all hosted in the clearnet. But their administrators are all living outside of the US and also do a very good job with keeping their identity a secret. 
Ross failed at 3 key points: Keeping illegal content away from his service (duh), staying away from the US, keeping his identity a secret.

Not that of an early adopter, but on 2013 pre small bubble I spent some dollars worth of BTC (that I had gathered from faucets only) on bitmit to buy games. Before humble bundle had opened its store, bitmit was really the only serious place that you could buy games for bitcoin
I would happily spend my bitcoins on games that were just a dollar below steam's price. I bought about a dozen in a months's span. Fun thing is that I had gained those faucet bitcoins when the price was below $15. So faucets had much greater rewards and at the time of spending my coins the value of the reward had vastly increased. 
At the time I had spent my last bit the price was around 60 USD, must have been around March 2013. At the same year I watched the price rise to $220 (first bubble) and $1150 later on.

It's not like I've been scammed, but after waiting for so long he went to get some sleep. Localbitcoin's quick sell feature directed me to a trusted trader and I used his service, it isn't the fastest around from what it seems.
Not that of an exciting introduction in the end. It was actually my friend that insisted ton receiving paypal money because he 'didn't have the time' to learn about bitcoin today. 
I knew that localbitcoins had some reliable traders and that they had a newly added quick sell feature so I thought it wasn't such a bad idea.
