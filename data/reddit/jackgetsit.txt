I was really anticipating it because I was going through old archive episodes and watched the original Peter Schiff one. Joe was a bit confrontational.  He did a much better job on this one.  When you finish there are some great discussions over at the joerogan sub. 
I almost always crave debate and discussion after Joe has a good guest.
The Ben Shapiro episode also had a lot of good comments and debates. Also one of the highest viewed/listened episodes.


Never heard of the guy.  I'll have to look into him.

It's crypto.  Nobody knows for sure.  I'm hoping we get a leveling off and slide back to 3500 in a week or two and a crash in 3-6 weeks (crashes are tough to predict but they WILL come).  Problem is that a bitcoin crash effects the entire alt market.  So you have to have money in fiat or tether or a coin already in the basement like ripple so that when the market is at the bottom you can buy back in to BTC and the alts.  If you try to buy alts with already depressed BTC what's the point?
Alts I like: IOTA, NEO, SIA (longterm and risky but I'm hodling), Faircoin, Factom, Civic, Status, ICN. XRP (longterm maybe, I'm watching this closely).  Things I keep an eye on but not invested in: GNT, NEM, OMG, XVG, BTS, and ARK.  Things I've lost interest in: BURST, XLM, DECRED, MONA, RDD, LTC.
Coins that are very stable but I'm not invested in and could act as safe havens during BTC slide: LTC, Monero.
Not Mentioned: ETH.  Just not sure about this damn thing.  It's going to definitely stay around but it just takes one or two ICO blow ups to mess up the value and create a bear on it for a long time IMHO.  I'm just staying out of ETH until NEO and ETH fight it out and the market decides.  If ETH has a drop back to 200 I will pick a little up.
ICO's I'm in: Agrello.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:41:16
Maybe not that low but close my guess is anywhere between 1800 and 2400 will be the next bottom.

Yea, that was a really good reply. I get where Schiff is coming from with BTC not having value the same way gold does; but he's not realizing that the value of digital currency is simply it's speed and usability.  BTC will one day fall to something better the same way gold will fall if a unique new metal was pulled out of the ground (I think IOTA and RIPPLE are good long term bets).  Schiff is also not understanding that some coins do have actual value like SIA that represents data storage or FUN and FAIR that represent access to games.  
Schiff is just struggling to understand where the market is going.  
OR he could be trying to keep the price down while he collects coins and soon he will come out in favor?  Schiff's opinion on things has a lot of weight and value because old school investors listen to him.  Can you imagine the flood of big players that would come into crypto if Schiff endorsed it?
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:44:22
If you want the price of BTC to rise you need it to be so usable it can penetrate markets like the M-pesa market.  Many people that could benefit from crypto are simple subsistence farmers like the ones that use [M-pesa.](
Having an attitude like, "if you don't understand it don't buy it!" will slow the growth of BTC and allow for competitors like IOTA to gain first mover status on those markets.
How many people use dollars and don't understand there divisibility??

Yea.  I'm actually not holding a lot of BTC right now because of the speed of the growth but I will be buying hard on the next crash because I think we are finally breaking through to the big money investors and BTC is going to become like Gold, property and art.  The elites will be buying up the BTC HARD because they already know they missed out on it early.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:44:50
Really?  I bought in at 440 and I've been watching it since 120 and I promise you it will rise and crash about 10 more times till it's as stable as fiat or gold.  You realize it was at 1800 like 2 weeks ago right?
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:39:02
Bitcoin will grow wildly if we the users and the exchanges just start referring to everything as satoshi's.  People love the idea that they own a 'million' of something and that will be seductive to new users.  Wasn't that Satoshi's goal anyway?  Using Satoshi's for daily transactions?

I wish Keiser would have called him on the 'You've never spent it' line.  More and more businesses are accepting crypto.  I can get on craigslist as well and people will buy my goods with crypto.  In a way it's even more accepted then gold right now.
edit.  Looks like he kind of did this later in the clip.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:13:29
I really don't understand your post.  The same way BTC has blown up holding onto those alts may, in the long run, turn out to be a great investment.  It's not a loss until you pull it out.  
Here's my amateur advice.  Do a very close evaluation of every alt coin you hold and reduce the number to a core group that you think will be around in the future.  That's it.  Holding onto more than 8-12 coins is difficult to manage.
Also just because the market is closely pegged to BTC now doesn't mean it will in the future.  I predict a very very healthy BTC AND altmarket in the future.  Just keep holding.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:14:09
They will probably wait for a small correction now.  My guess is next semi-crash will see a hard ATH follow it.

Some nodes would survive and IOTA is quantum secure.  You're going to have to do better then that.

They are certainly critical.  There's gold in tons of electronic equipment and the reason a lot of it is on a shelf is because it's getting harder and harder to find it in the ground.  My guess is that banks will also start storing helium in 50 years because it will be so hard to find and so necessary for our future techy society that it will have a lot of value.  All you have to do to be valuable is be rare and useful. That's it.

The case was covered in lots of papers and there are lots of other similar cases.  Just google it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:00:43
Sure.  I think Schiff mentions though that the best stores of value are not only rare but have core underlying usage.  Gold has uses.  Even if the price goes way down people will always want it for a few of those uses.  A fundamental human need is to look pretty and signal power and gold also does that very well through jewelry.  Civilization could collapse and people will still drape gold all over themselves.  I guess you could say that the only underlying usage that BTC has is that it's not reproducible but there are lots and lots of alt coins that are doing that in unique, quick and affordable ways. I also that that BTC has also gained a lot of trust which when dealing with finances is VERY valuable.  BTC just needs to hope that one of its competitors doesn't gain MORE trust over the years.

The corruption normally comes from the top.  Some small police force captain gets an order to watch for shady Mexican drug cartel cash movements and he informs his officers to look for cash more aggressively and convinces them that "anyone" could be a courier.  Then after the officer has filed his report and headed home that night he doesn't really track the case. His part is over and his morality is safe.  The captain and leaders above him know that the money will get trapped in the bureaucracy and end up back at his precinct were he can buy new guns, cars, and [margarita]( machines.  Nobody really feels bad for stealing the dudes money because if you want to make an omelet you gotta crack some eggs right? There's also definitely some [bystander effect]( and diffusion of responsibility going on. It takes leadership and political capital to fix these things and we don't have it right now.

Recession and even depressions are a healthy part of a capitalistic market.  They force weak businesses to die and they reward and encourage a saving habit.  Housing is a good example of this.  If the market just keeps going up there's no incentive to save and wait for a correction.  It also keep new home buyers out.  A downturn allows for a shake up and for new buyers to enter the market. It's when you artificially prevent recession and depression with government intervention you set yourself up for huge depressions and enormous systemic risk that could take the whole system down.

All good businesses are pricing cartels who seek to find the cheapest labor possible.  Just because you want to pay an employee the lowest possible amount you can negotiate doesn't mean you want to exploit them.  If business didn't do this they would be replaced with a competitor that did. That's capitalism.

Amazing comment.  I wish people understood that it's a good thing Dimon can manipulate the market.  It means it's a free unregulated market.  The minute it becomes overly regulated fat cats make even more money because THEY decide how it's going to get regulated.  We should laugh when Dimon and others make these plays because it shows they are giving in and entering the market.  It's a tacit vote for the future of crypto.

Where do you get male culling out of that?  I didn't say male infanticide.  Abstinence, condoms, pull out method and vasectomy are the only birth control methods available to men and they all have their problems. POM and condoms can be sabotaged by women (needle in the condom or lying about her birth control).  [Vasalgel]( is a reliable consistent and reversible form of contraception for men that's nearing market.  Now men will be able to refute false paternity claims and women will have fewer tools to trap men into marriage and child support.
BTC is the other end of freeing men from women.  Even though BTC is not anonymous it's a lot easier for a man to hide funds from his ex, her lawyer and the state.  This makes women less prone to divorce because men can truly control their own capital again.  Even if they are divorced they can operate more comfortably if they've squirreled away funds.

I think at this point BTC will never go away.  It's way to ingrained in the cypto community psycho like gold is in the financial community psyche.  Won't matter if fees go up.  Won't matter if the community flubs up aug 1 and the price takes a huge hit.  BTC will go on but other coins will probably dominate the future of cypto.  BTC will just become a benchmark store of wealth.  That's it.
