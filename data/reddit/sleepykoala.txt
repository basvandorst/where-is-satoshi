true, if the sun is remove, everything will go back to being parts of systems. The sun is gone, but there will be another star, where the planets orbit around, and it will be the centralized light and heat source of that system.

This only works for those who adopt bitcoin in the very early stage.
Try to tell that to the people who bought at 1200$

If you look at the solar system, satellites orbits around the planet, and planets orbit around the sun.

How can falling price attracts new people? It has been falling for over 1.5 years. I doubt any new people who does not understand bitcoin will not touch it at all by just looking at the chart.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:46:53
with all the trading fees. you are likely to lost 5-15% of the value

I have registered, setup google auth and security password as well. However, the balance is still 0.0000 BTC

No worries. there will be a Monero foundation soon :p

even the human's body is centralized. Although all somatic cells have the identical DNA, most of them have to obey to the neuronal/hormonal control of the brain.

Well, you still don't know if the coins are actually held by individual, except it is timestamped and signed by the privkey.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:48:30
exchanges keep records of their users too. just not as aggressive as coinbase.

I am sure merchants do not want to take risk, especially on this down trend market.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:06:34
It does not seem at worst yet. I expect lower :D

another 2 exchange and 1 online wallet are currently not accessible:
1. 
2. 
3. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:50:14
you still need an exchange for conversion of bitusd to real usd.

BTC Future with 20x leverage on okcoin will give faster profit/lost

not sure if they are reorganizing their cold wallet, or someone else is helping them to move the coins.

the PC is not 100% secure when there are "several anti-malware...anti-troians...anti-rootkits...software"
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:20:30
but bitBTC is not real BTC, it is the fiat of BTC
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:30:19
until they get compromised too. Even traditional banks that are funded by millions of dollars can't escape from hack
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:37:26
correct me if I am wrong. As far as I know, the collateral reserve is denominated in BTS, not BTC

I don't mean it is hack, but just some issues there, and apparently it has been resolved.
