In Crypto a -30% or -20% day is not tanking.  That is just normal volatility.

Yes, but you are essentially scamming your landlord

Lol, what, it's literally done this kind of price action for the past 8 years.

It's caused by a few people who put up 200+ BTC buy / sell walls to keep it between a fixed range.  The only way it breaks out of the range is if the wall gets bought/sold really quickly or if the whale decides to stop doing it

Lots of different theories, some say to buy more at this price range before it shoots up.  Could just be a whale playing games and having fun

I honestly think Bitcoin Cash and the confusion it causes is severely damaging Bitcoin's reputation

What are you trying to do with your bitcoin? Move it to another exchange?

They're valued in BTC sure, but when BTC tanks some alts will go way up on the ratio

A lot of people are moving from coins with high marketcaps to coins with low market caps.  Half my portfolio is hitting all time highs today

Bitcoin 30k in 1 month.  @ me

That widespread bitcoin adoption would mean prices much, much higher than 1 million per coin

Has bitcoin ever went flat for a few days and then went down?  The only thing I've ever seen was bitcoin being flat then going up
