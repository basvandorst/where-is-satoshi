If it's not decentralized then why is it better than current centralized services?

Bitcoin doesn't have to replace all fiat currencies. Only a small percentage of Bitcoin supporters believe in hyperbitcoinization.

It's just an expression. There will always be someone willing to pay. Even confido is still being traded.

Everyone should read the whitepaper, but it shouldn't be gospel. Development is an iterative process.

None of them. We might see another meaningful fork this year but don't count on it.

Slow and steady wins the race.
