When I joined Digital Ocean I got $10 credit which is enough to pay for about 2 months of their lowest tier VPS. If you join before the new storage thing is rolled out you'll probably get offered the free terabyte trial, too.
It's very quick to fire up a cloud server. There are probably even better promo codes out there than the free $10 if you have a Google.

That's exactly what I'm planning. Are you whit from Opal? Hi.

And surely any other software wallet, like electrum. So how do I double up my coins on fork day?
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:16:24
A couple of the big exchanges are honouring the fork by splitting people's BTC balance into BTC and BTCC when the fork happens.
Is it possible that I could send my BTC to Bitfinex (for example), using the `OP_RETURN` code, then Bitfinex would split my coins for me but I could also spend the privkey again on the the BTCC chain so I end up with my original BTC and two lots of BTCC? Is there something wrong with this plan?

OK. Thanks. I will try `OP_RETURN` but also try and start a discussion higher up in the thread so that myself and others can see how to perform it before the big day arrives.

Ah! I see! Thanks. So it's simply a case of backing up the private key, spending from the PK as BTC and then spending from the same PK as BCC using a BCC compatible wallet. Cheers.

How much storage does it use? Do you have to sync the entire BTC blockchain?
Thinking of doing it on a DigitalOcean VPS.

I think what I will do is just move $1 worth of BTC to a test address and try it without the OP_RETURN. If that works I will take it from there. Thanks for alerting me to this.

Whooa! I'm just a simpleton! How do I include a special o/p in my transaction?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:56:46
Are there any wallets with replay protection built-in? I'm compiling this one at the moment:
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:56:31
But won't the BCC leave your wallet to a new address along with the BTC? I'm confused!
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:18:25
Ah, OK. Probably too much for the starting tier 20GB VPS then. I've signed up for their free 1TB storage trial which is supposed to be starting soon, so I might do it if they give me a temporary 1TB.
