I spent over $800.00 on gyft.com for amazon gift cards and upon redeeming their amazon codes on my amazon account, amazon closed my account immediately emailing me that i have to contact the seller of the gift card because the gift certificate was invalid.
Whats worse is that i emailed them dozens of times asking what happened but they never responded back to my email so i proceeded to call their customer service only to get automated responses stating that their customer service is busy.  I proceeded to visit their facebook page to write on their wall my complaint about my situation only to get my post deleted after 10 minutes along with this company closing my Gyft account.
 Whats horrible is that im out $800.00 and a closed amazon account.   DO NOT TRUST THIS WEB
