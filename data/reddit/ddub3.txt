Yah this - maybe watch a documentary with her. Try to show her your side and if she can explain bitcoin back to you then it might spin her opinion. It took me a while with my fiancée. Mainly because she didn’t fully understand it. Took almost a month of talking about it whenever she brought it up. I quietly invested my own money and after showing her the impressive moves it made she agreed to invest more of our money. We’re only doing 10% of our non-retirement investment fund. But yes you’re a team, and your relationship should mean more than any amount of money.

My opinion is that it’s not gonna go sub 15 anytime soon possibly ever again. Today is a very standard swing in the price of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:55:30
Don’t do that. Cost average all the way up and if there’s a correction cost average all the way down. Otherwise you’ll end up like every other sideliner going - “I wish I had bought at 9k, 10k, 11k, 12k....all of which just happened in less than 2 weeks. Stop waiting, start buying. Bitcoin is a baby in the sea of financial markets and it’s just learning to crawl. Wait til it learns to jump. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:40:46
Yep, ^

I’d say that most technologies are not environmentally sustainable so it’s kind of an irrelevant question. Like light bulbs, bitcoin can be made more efficient and made to use less energy. Furthermore renewables would make the total draw of btc irrelevant as well. It’s a false equivalency really when put up against other things like international shipping and cars. We’re talking about a global network of value, with p2p transactions and a trustless ledger. This shit is capable of running the entire global economic system. Of course it’s gonna draw a fuck ton of power. Just like most technologies the world runs on - they’re environmentally unsustainable. But even short term this is probably irrelevant as with enough solar or wind you could make it entirely renewable.

I’m currently enjoying this “bubble” and will continue to do so in the many years ahead. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:58:06
Same here. I do believe we’ll see between 40-60k next year though so it’s just hodl time and buy every dip you can. Interested to see how futures make things swing. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:10:41
Yah 10-20% seems safe at the moment. I might go in more if/when lightning gets implemented. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:33:29
Yep this! I bought GBTC at $800 and basically saved myself from the massive tech sell-off the past week. It is however extremely volatile. Like, more than actual btc. Watched it rocket from $500-$1000 and back down in like 2 days and then a few weeks later here we are at 1700+. Been insane and made a good amount of gains on my 401k. More in 1 month than I usually do in 1 year. But like the above comment says the minute the etf comes it’s going to close that gap and probably the best time to switch if you want to stay invested in btc on the us exchange. On the other hand if btc goes to 50k or something it won’t matter if you hold the etf or gbtc because both are going way up. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:35:04
This subreddits are definitely not the same. Idk enough about how they were split but it has to do with a past fork. I have followed both but take everything on both channels with a grain of salt. Over the past year /btc has been extremely negative, but what did the price of bitcoin actually do over the last 12 months? Record highs every 30-60 days. I think you’ve made the right judgement call trusting crypto and my personal opinion is that it’s still way too early for a major player like bitcoin to tumble. It’s going to take all our global adoption of one single coin to tumble all the others. I think it’s much more likely we see all crypto rise for another 2-3 years as new exchanges wallets and systems are created. Don’t panic sell now - as you can see it’s already re-stabilized at 17.5 and it’s looking like that was just a minor correction. Two weeks ago the graph would have told you the price would be roughly 16k anyways so we’re still above margins from 2 weeks ago. Hell they said we wouldn’t hit 10k by eoy and we are knocking on the door of 20k before XMAS. I think your best bet is to just stop reading news altogether about the price. Learn more about technical aspects of bitcoin but steer clear of the positive and negative hype trains. They will cause you to stress over nothing when in reality you know you want to just hold for 5 years and see where this goes ;) 
I will say one last thing though and this is repeated daily here - do not invest more than you are willing to lose. There is a chance that bitcoin does drop to 6k and if you give into the hype you’ll sell at a massive loss just like so many in 2014 did only to have it rocket to 8k not long after. Crypto has been alive about half as long as a normal long term investment. 8 years instead of 15. Give it another 8 years and it will have been around long enough for people to actually start analyzing it. (Even though that’s a long shot) For now it’s breaking every investment rule in the book. If you bought too much I’d suggest selling some to make your financial life now less stressful. You don’t want to hold a commodity that is this volatile if you won’t be able to stomach a 50-70% drop. Because this particular investment is capable of such a thing.

Thank you. This is almost everyone’s experience who has hodl’d
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:57:55
Yes to this a million times. I’m tired of the buy the dip shit. Most dips last an hour or two and when you compare the dip to the next rise it’s more like a pothole. Cost average always and don’t try to time a market. Especially one that’s only 8 years old and has broken every rule of the stock market. This is not your poppas stock portfolio. This is all totally new territory.

This is fake clearly. If you’ve got proof show it, otherwise please gtfo with this bs. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:50:07
Completely agree with that last point haha! The more early adopters who actually believe in the long term growth of bitcoin the better. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:29
That’s what we’ve all been thinking for 3 years...still hasn’t been the end yet. Think of it in terms of the rise/fall/rise of the dot com. Lots of losers and a handful of mega winners. What were experiencing is still the early phases of crypto currency adoption. We might be hitting the middle phase next year but even so, consider that almost half the world still doesn’t have internet access, yet without the internet the world would crumble. Just sit tight and 18k will feel like a distant memory in about 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:36:01
How legit is this? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:35:03
Exactly! This is why most believe it will stabilize 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:30:34
I don’t think they even know. If anything today’s pump was testament that bitcoin can blow up in an hour and settle right back into formation. I could be wrong but I dont think there was a dump today in terms of large amounts being sold at once. We’re right back to “normal” daily growth. Well normal as of the past week haha!
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:34:51
Yah it moves in big bursts now as news, access, social media, and week cycles rotate. I feel like since thanksgiving it’s just been green... except for that one day haha. I’m guessing as many others a pullback now around 20k in jan, but at this rate it could be before Christmas now. In reality that’s just another 35% growth. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:44:08
Yah I’m tired of this whole - “you must” argument. There hasn’t been a massive exchange crash/hack in years on bitcoin and most are backed now by some financial security. Most crypto noobs are more apt to lose money trying to transfer to a software or hardware wallet than if they had just left it on their exchange wallet. Bad advice for all, good advice for some. Especially if you have a lot of crypto.

Can someone make this the hook to a new song?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:50:18
You missed the dip already lol. Buy now, buy more next week and the week after. You’re bound to hit the next dip eventually. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:15:32

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:04
Haha I read this right as it hit 19.2. Completely agree. The supply is ridiculously low and demand is not slowing in the slightest. Only increasing. Hang on tight!! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:55:40
This is like saying give your money to the people who have a bunch of gold and they will hold that gold for you. Great in theory, but why not just get the gold yourself and store it? Then no one can tamper with it. Always best to own the asset. I do own gbtc as well but not nearly as much as btc. And also because I can throw some of my IRA at it. So it’s good for some things, but better to own the coins when you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:06:55
You using it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:12:00
Agreed. At some point it should level out though. Where idk... lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:19
Ah gotcha!! Yah you have a valid point for sure. Futures launch that same day too. One can only imagine the shitstorm that would happen if the govt said fuck it and shutdown lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:48:15
Wake up - open coinbase. Still above last months price? Yes? Close coinbase and go to work. No? Close coinbase and go to work lol. You can be informed as you want, you still can’t ever predict this shit. Cost average, hodl, and enjoy your life right now. The amount of money you might make from day trading and living in the crypto space is negligent compared to 5+ years of just hodling. At least that’s my opinion. I’ve done the whole “watch gdax all day” and also done the don’t check the price for 1 week, and the latter was a lot more fun and a lot less stressful. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:27:33
This! Why fight a climbing system?? The shorts won’t be at least until 100k. Why break something that works just fine? The institutional investors with millions to spend will run it up as high as possible then ride it on down. Hopefully by that point bitcoin has enough adopters that any attempts to short would just fail and it can finally level out 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:14:46
Probs right! Fingers crossed :)

This guy gets it. You either believe in bitcoin and invest only what you can afford to lose. Checking prices only to find a good time to buy your next weekly/monthly amount. Dollar cost average as much as possible and don’t touch it until at least 2023. If you invest in something you should only do it if you’re willing to follow it for 5+ years. Anything less and you’re speculating and not investing. Borderline gambling. It’s crazy how many people are now like - I invest in bitcoin, and then sell 2 days later only to buy high and sell low!!

Go to gdax.com same people as coinbase but you can transfer with no fees. Get verfied and only pay the transaction fee which is miniscule all in gdax. I think I bought $500 last month with like a $.91 Fee. Downside is it takes quite a few days to transfer usd to gdax. Where as coinbase you can do it very fast.

I don’t get what you’re asking for...if this is in fact a male dominated situation, what is keeping women from opening an account on an exchange and buying crypto? Let me answer that - nothing. Just because there are a lot of men in the crypto space, or even a majority male, that doesn’t mean they dominate it or make it harder for women to buy it. It just means the majority of crypto users are male. End of story. Any extra speculation as to why that is, is just fucking loony talk. Maybe consider asking the hard questions, why aren’t there more females in the crypto space? Why are the normal stock exchanges also male dominated? Ever consider starting your revolution there?? Crypto isn’t biased against women, crypto isn’t biased for men. It just so happens the majority investing their money in the space are men. Your reform should be about educating more women to invest in crypto, not trying to overthrow those who already follow it. We will need both men and women interested in crypto for it to work long term. This isn’t a place for a revolution either, this is the revolution. Get on board or gtfo. We’re all on the same team here. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:12
The supply of bitcoin available to buy is way down. On gdax it halved in 24 hours down to only 2100 btc available. I’m sure there’s plenty of more reasons but supply and demand is taking its toll on the price. We’ll see how long this can hold out for. Hodl all day and hodl all night.

It’s happened with people shorting other companies like Tesla and shit. Could def happen with btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:20:34
I think people are giving you shit here for two reasons. 
1. You could have googled this in 5 seconds.
2. That is one of the basic concepts of investing and first things you should understand. 
You not knowing the answer to this scares actual bitcoin users because you are gambling. And that is further backed up by your statement of Texas hold ‘em. People aren’t here to gamble, they want to own a piece of a technological revolution. Making gains is one positive thing about bitcoin right now but it is not the long term goal of it. Don’t invest in things you don’t understand, and don’t solicit advice for things you can find out extremely easy on your own. Makes you sound lazy. People here aren’t assholes, they’re just tired of people coming to this sub trying to get rich quick. This is exactly what we do not want. If you missed the post about the young guy committing suicide over bitcoin then you’d understand. Gambling=bad  &amp; investing can = bad. Smart investing = good, but going into an investment questioning how quick can you double your principal is naive. Learn as much as you can before investing in btc. It’s definitely a better option than pure gambling. Also google is your bff. Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:51:27

Coming from a semi newbie - I’ve said those same words 5 times before. Once a month since August. Then I just said fuck it and bought as much as I could safely stomach. Haven’t regretted any of the 5 times. Can’t time btc just like you can’t time the news or the stock market. Just gotta believe in the long term dream of decentralized money, and cost average that bitch! Good luck!!��

I think they have more but quite possibly cashed out some. That’s insane though $113mil at current price. I wonder what that’s worth when it was at 19.2. Smh absolutely nuts
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:12
The end of what era? Sub-20k?? 
Btc is still the same price it was a week ago. Sit tight - everyone’s freaking out about standard swings. If you can just buy more as it bottoms out. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:16
Still above last weeks price. If you have btc and think this is hard to stomach you shouldn’t be investing any of your money. Just sit tight and buy more if you can. A fire sale like this won’t last long! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:41:44
Seriously gtfo with this SJW bullshit. Crypto has no bias. Any human can buy whenever. It’s always been like this. Haha delete this post cmon with this shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:10:41
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:24:26
It has historically followed that rule of thumb, but not always. As of recent if bitcoin went up over the weekend then GBTC would be up Monday morning. But I’ve also seen it drop disproportionate to bitcoin swings. So play it safe as always. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:51
What reasons do you think would make it hit 6k? And if it did what would your plan be then? One of the age old investment mottos is to never invest in anything you don’t believe will last at least 15 years. With crypto you can bring that down to 5 since Shit seems to move so fast. So if you aren’t planning on holding a commodity for more than 5 years then you don’t trust it enough and shouldn’t invest. That would be my opinion. Even if it did bottom out to 6k, btc has come back from every major long term bear market and succeeded 2-3x every time. I think historically it would be a complete guess to say that btc hits 6k and then never comes back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:02:22
No, it’s just obvious that you have little knowledge on this subject. You’re just repeating what every new bitcoin user is saying. Buy the dip blah blah. If you actually bought the dip that would have been a few days ago when it hit 8700 for like 20 minutes. Good luck being at your computer with the right limit order set ready to buy in more. It’s just the stupidest advice you can give. Cost average, buy whenever you can and hold. Stop trying to time this shit, you will never get it right. And even if you get it right once, you will fail 10 times more. 
Had friend buy in at 10k right before it dropped to 8. Now look it’s almost at 12. Don’t tell people to time the market: end of story. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:47
A real hodler ^ 
The crazy thing is that’s still short term gains in the stock market. Everyone in here expecting to make life long gains in a week and retire lol. No one in crypto has patience it seems. I prefer long steady growth rather than this hyped up volatile roller coaster ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:26:15
Just remember don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. While we all have complete faith in bitcoin and crypto as a whole, we have little faith in our government and the major banks who still may want to fuck shit up for the rest of us some way or another. Long term though - bitcoin is going to the moon and stars. Everyone else is either unknowledgeable on the subject, or invested on the other side of the fence. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:37:58
Yep - only invest what you can afford to lose today. Just like any other investment. I am holding strong at 10% of my portfolio in crypto. It was more about 3 weeks ago but recently I diversified out and into stocks and index funds just to have a little less volatility in my life haha. No saying where this goes in 5-10 years because it could truly go way up or all the way down. At the end of the day, just imagine your bitcoin investment going to 0. Were you in it because you believed in blockchain tech? Or were you in it to get rich quick? A lot of times your own reasons for why you do something should be a good indicator as to how much you should invest. The difference between investing and gambling is that you actually foresee yourself losing it, rather than the other way around. Be smart and stay safe. You know things have gotten really intense when people are committing suicide over the “what if” of investments.  Hodl on!
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:55:31
From a design standpoint this is a great idea. I’d love to see bitcoin get so high that we only speak in “bits” and that would be roughly a dollar. Ugh that will be the day!

Lol if that was the case everyone would do it. Gambling by definition is playing odds....so is Texas hold ‘em. It’s literally the odds of the deck. Sure there are some skills you can learn like redirection, mastering your poker face, or bluffing but it doesn’t matter. If someone gets pocket aces and you get pocket Kings. There’s a better chance you lose than win. This is the definition of gambling. 
“If you play like you have some sense” - then why aren’t you a Texas hold ‘em millionaire?? 
You saying you didn’t put money into btc so you could give your kid a Christmas is the first logical thing you’ve said in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:52:11
I think a majority of Americans have heard about bitcoin but that same majority knows shit all about how it works and what it is. Or furthermore what it’s purpose is in the financial markets. Most Americans have heard the word blockchain but I guarantee 99% can’t explain what it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:51:35
Gtfo with this half baked prediction. No sources, no analysis, just a fucking guess from someone who probably hasn’t own btc for more than a month lol. Go back to earlier this year when we had 20% swings on the reg. Weak ass hands in this community.  Has no one ever invested in anything longer than a trip to the toilet? Fuckn hold this shit for 5+ years at least. Not 5 days. Sheesh. Getting me all heated. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:38:09
I think it’s hard to call something a bubble when it’s been labeled as such 5+ times in the past. It seems that every major move is another chance to call it a bubble. You either believe that bitcoin is revolutionary or you don’t. I personally believe the technology and concept behind crypto is one of the major achievements of the last 50 years. Take a look at how long money has been around, and how little time this concept has existed. It has already taken huge jumps, I can only see it going higher considering the current global adoption and general move to get value (money) out of the control of the government and banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:34:56
This is true - but the technical hurdle of doing so is far greater than just creating a user friendly wallet system that people can trust. Not too many people - even bitcoin holders, understand the magnitude of your private keys. They are literally your bank. I just think that concept is so far from reality for most people that they’ll never really grasp it. It would be better for someone to make a large scale user friendly wallet that links direct with an exchange. But then you risk losing security and decentralized trust. So there’s a lot of problems you have to overcome. Like early computer days when you had to know how to use a terminal to do anything. Eventually someone made it easier with software. We’re right on the cusp of that - new simple wallets are being created daily. We just need them mainstream now. Until then I think it’s 50/50. A lot of people make the mistake of sending bitcoin to the wrong address or lost it altogether trying to move it. And yes hacks do happen, but they are so rare nowadays. So I’m on the fence right now overall, but I don’t think we can loop everyone into the “you must put it in a wallet” category. Because I’ve had money in both wallets and on the exchange with no issues so far. As long as you’re safe with it, and smart, you should be fine. Plus most people are holding less than 1 btc so that also makes it a moot point. Anyone with more than 1 btc though should already understand all these things you’re saying, and have their shit on a wallet. You’re right there :)

Just another opinion article. Why is everyone on the edges about bitcoin? It’s either the savior or the anti-Christ. Gtfo with your back-less predictions. Just because something is hyped doesn’t mean it’s gonna fail. When everyone and their grandma was buying iPods do you think tons of people were going “oh iPods are just a fad - they’ll be dead next year.” Of course they did...and they were very very wrong. Just because something is popular, doesn’t mean it’s hyped and gonna fail. Bitcoin is not a fidget spinner concept. It’s been around for 9 years already and has weathered massive attacks, media frenzy, and all our hate from the investment communities. And here you are after a 20% correction stating it’s dead. That today December 21 is the tipping point? After 9 years of this? Nah dawg. Jamie Dimon said the same shit 7 times over the last 6 years. Every time he was wrong. And he’s got more investing experience than probably anyone in this sub. Unless you’re coming in here with legitimate analysis as to why you think bitcoin is now going to tank - along with all crypto with it (because without bitcoin pretty much every crypto would fall 80-90%) then don’t come posting here. Most of us aren’t here to speculate on price or get rich now. We want our money out of government hands and away from bank control. That’s our dream, a free money network where no government or third party can interfere. I’m guessing if you bought btc - you bought well after 15k or you got involved not long before. If you’ve been here since 2013 then you’ll know that today is just another day in crypto. A slightly more exciting week than normal :)

Buy buy buy. Shits on sale. It’s still the same price it was a week ago. Not even the slightest afraid.

Not all of us are new to bitcoin either. I was there for the long long bear of 2013-2015. Your logic is just flawed in the sense that you say there’s a correction coming today, tomorrow, next week or the week after. That’s just silly to say. Haha. Of course it’s gonna move around, of course there will be more corrections, but advising people not to buy and just wait is even sillier. Bitcoin is so young in the grand scheme and the very small amount of gains you might make by waiting for yet another “correction” which we had last week, is like telling someone to wait to start their marathon for 30 more seconds because the temperature will be just right. No, get in, cost average, and get ready for the next 5-10 years. If you’re concerned about 4Hr RSI then you’ve missed the point of bitcoin holding. Most bitcoiners are not here to day trade or wait for the next dip. We want in on the big picture and the long haul. We’re not trying to rip you apart, we’re just saying that 99% of people don’t need this advice. We’re not here to squeeze that extra 2% out of the weeks gains. You’re looking at the difference between 1000% and 1002% in my eyes which is a large amount of stress for little gains. That’s really all we’re getting at here. This is too granular for most investors and it’s bad advice for the majority of bitcoin users. Most of these folks don’t even know what RSI is or how to even read a fucking candle chart. So telling people to day trade is a negative for the whole community. It means more people losing money and dropping out bitcoin because they were told they could make quick gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:38:10
And then a week from now it’ll pass 20k lol. The patterns are ridiculous at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:06:54
Only reason not to invest is if you don’t understand it, or if you don’t have the ability to lose the money you’re about to invest. Don’t invest what you can’t lose.

Wow he of all people deserves every bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:52:19
I like to ask myself this question - have people stopped buying gold? Like any commodity, if it’s in demand people will buy it. Doesn’t matter the price. Most people know diamonds are way over-inflated yet we still buy them. I personally believe bitcoin has a long way to go, but also a lot of technical hurdles still to be discovered. It’s going to be a while before we see any leveling off I think but volatility should slow down as futures get in place. But this is just what I’ve heard a majority of and my own opinion. This could all be total bullshit haha! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:37:16
I think you only need the 10% deposit upfront but you probs need collateral if you have less than 100k
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:54:42
This is terrrrrible advice. You will eat these words the second you try to take some capital gains and spend it in something other than bitcoin. Always always pay your taxes. The IRS is ruthless and will end your life. Taxes are the reason you went to a public school, the reason you have roads to drive on, and the reason you’re probably not dead. Taxes are a huge part of any society and telling others to break the law just “because bitcoin” is naive. Crypto was not made to evade taxes either, it was made to allow you to control your own money. But nonetheless even if bitcoin was the only currency we used, we would still need some form of taxation to have a functioning society. Otherwise that’s what’s known as anarchy. And while it works in small groups, it won’t work for the 300 million+ Americans you propose to evade their taxes. Lol. That’s not the purpose of bitcoin at all.

Maybe, maybe not. Long term it doesn’t matter lol. Unless you’re day trading don’t take profits under 20k because it’s gonna pass that. Even then you’re best holding another decade and just accumulating instead of timing the market.

Hold until it passes $500 jumps an hour for 2 consecutive hours. Or $1000 jump in 2 hours. We’re close but haven’t peaked yet. My strategy at this point is to start selling 10% at 18k and then 10% more every 3-5k move until I’m out or it pops. Holding on to my last 10% though because I like to still feel like a hodler when the coaster drops for a while. It’ll swing back down to 10k after it hits 50. But this is just my guess/opinion :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:14:43
And congrats to those who panic bought lol ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:40:04
Yah I bought more this morning too haha. Already up 8% on it. DCA all day son
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:21:27
Yah until then it’s just noise and the media isn’t going to report on it until it’s really really exciting. The talks are picking up more each day but it takes a few weeks for the cycles to hit the bigger tv spots/newspaper spreads.

Moonmath.win has a fun little algorithmic prediction that so far has been pretty on point.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:50
Definitely been exceeding but both. $100/mth since it first came around to 6k after the 2017 pop. It’s gone down to 3 and back up in the same time the rest of my portfolio has move 4%. If nothing else bitcoin is fucking invigorating. Definitely in the green though, but trying to play it safe. We’re seeing flash crashes now so we’re nearing the top in terms of days away. But price wise that could be 40k it could be 100k. It’s hard to say how much it pulls in from other markets due to hyper FOMO.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:47:16
Ya this will be a hurdle for a long time. It’s like getting the US to switch to the metric system. The laymen bitcoin user can’t wrap their head around spending sats, they’ll still need to know how many dollareydoos that is so that they can tell if the value is right for them. A pizza for 20k sats sounds scary. But if it’s $9 in bitcoin then it’s chill. So somewhere along the line we’re gonna need to find a solid system for moving people into this new financial language. Otherwise people will be frightened to use it thinking they’re gonna get ripped off.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:38:51
Do you know to what extent this has happened? Like how much “unbacked” tether is there and how much has been converted into bitcoin? I mean this could potentially be really bad if true
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:19:08
I use my credit card to buy on coinbase because it’s easy and I make the entire fee back on mile points so the Fee become irrelevant for me. Plus as of late you make that fee back in a day on gains haha! But honestly some people just prefer to use credit cards for everything possible because they earn points. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:21:38
There’s been so much speculation about the cyclical nature of bitcoin over the last 9 years. Moonmath.win has a logarithmic cycle that is unbelievably accurate as far as value stores go. So it could be a system of cyclical supply and demand and were seeing larger quantities of people slowly move value into bitcoin due to various economical factors. I do agree though with everything you’re saying and that a new ATH is pretty much necessary to maintain the cycle. Otherwise I’m not sure what we’ll be looking at lol. it definitely has some tie to the down turns in economies and currencies globally. It’s too coincidental that negative stuff to the USD happens and then btc goes up.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:44:14
Don’t look at it for 3 years I dare you. Lol. But honestly if this is true I hope you have iron hands because it’s bout to get nutty around here.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:54:36
Yah you gotta do this manually. Figure out what your dollar cost average was in total and that’s your break even price. Then just work from there.

I know fuck me right? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:16:38
Hold always because one day it will hit 100k. And then it will keep climbing until, like someone else in this thread said, it will replace currency. I can’t say if it will be bitcoin per se but crypto currency is the internet of the financial world and it will completely alter our way of exchanging value from human to human. The tech is out and it will be commonplace in the next ten years. The percentage of people who know about and are invested in bitcoin is so freaking small it’s amazing that it’s already worth 10k. I think that simple fact just means another 10x is a drop in the bucket compared to how much value is still in the world sitting in different currencies and resources. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:58:27
Under his eye. God speed
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:33:32
I’m not 100% sure haha that’s just my optimism. I truly believe in the technology and the concept of crypto though. However, I also believe you should only invest what you can lose, and definitely manage your risk as much as possible. I keep no more than 30% of my invested money in crypto. The rest is stocks and other various index funds. Best to not put all your eggs in one basket. Cost-average and stick to your plan. In the end it’s all about compounding that interest and long term growth. Fuck the bubble nonsense too because imo if there’s gonna be a bubble it will be at the peak right before bitcoin overthrows some major currency like the euro. Not at some Y2K moment of 10k. even with the massive amounts of limit sells set for it haha
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:32:53
Ha! Yup ;)

Preaching to the choir dude...def worth it though to learn everything you can in this space. It’s not going to disappear anytime soon. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:06:14
Soon, oh so soon. Start taking at just below the ATH then DCA the fuck out every 3-5k jump at about 10% of your portfolio. Try to ride it until you’re out of there before it hits 50-60k when it ultimately pops. My guess is we won’t pass 100k until 2020 but when we do it will fly to like 175-210k. It won’t stop at 100.  At this point the hype is going to push it back to at minimum 19k and when cbs and fox start reporting about it on their morning news clips that circulate on their social accounts, then you know it’s about to hockey stick. That’s when you start to pull out. When the no-coiner starts going all in around 18k. Then when the no-coiners finally ride the pop - you’ll hear news about how bitcoin is dead, it will plummet back just below 10k in my opinion before another bull run in early 2020 at the halvening. All speculation :)

I’ve owned some with my IRA since it was $850. Best trade ever on the stock market period. But boy is it volatile phew!!! 
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:31:22
Completely agree with your sentiment. Honestly can’t get behind any other coins. Some have solid foundations and ideas, but still none compare to decentralization of bitcoin. I’m glad to hear the value is accounted for up to now. I hope folks keep their eyes on more of these types of scams. 
What would happen if say another coin managed to exchange into bitcoin, a ton of alts, and then disappeared? Would the transactions null on the bitcoin ledger? Or would it devalue the entire supply?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:53:54
I think when countries and entire communities are storing their value away from their local currency - its a sign the economic factors are definitely in play. Anytime your local currency is shitting you’re going to move your money into the quickest and historically best earning asset on the market - btc. It may be speculative on the large scale but people have saved their own lives and those of their families in places like Venezuela using bitcoin after their currency tanked. So it definitely plays a factor. Tether manipulation too plays a factor, in just not sure how much on the grand scale of global adoption and what the price may look like in 10-20 years.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:42:43

The fomo won’t hit until a new ATH. When it hits around 18.5k get ready to gtfo or hold on for dear life because it’s gonna blast off. We’re still in that early knee of the curve. All opinion of course ;)

Buy As much as you can lose. I recently bought $500 back in the beginning of August. Up about 25%. A little over $600 now. It's not about the weeks or months. It's about where bitcoin will be in 5-10 years if we can get global adoption. It's about putting your money outside of the hands of government and third parties. 
My advice - Buy and hodl. Then buy more whenever you can. Don't worry about timing either. That 5-10% swing won't matter when we're talking 1000-2000% the value it is now, in a decade. While most investments would only grow 10% annually, bitcoin has shown its capable of much more. I'll be investing another $500 every two weeks from here on out splitting my investments between bitcoin and the us stock market. My gains in two weeks with bitcoin were greater than 3 months of FAANG on the S&amp;P. But the key here is buy only what you can lose. So much is uncertain. It's like betting that ATT would be the internet giant it is today, in 1985 before the internet was really a thing. Bitcoin is in its infancy so if you believe in the idea and technology then sit back and ride the very very long wave to global adoption. It might not be bitcoin in particular - but it will be some form of global digital currency that alters the world wide economies. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:18:57
I agree. No reason to tear people down. If they were just trying to make a quick buck though then they learn the hard way like everyone else. I bought at $4050. Watched it crash down to 3 and it will make its slow climb back to 5k. So long as we continue to believe in it, we will continue to climb!
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:46:08
I figured that was the case. I had to roll over a 401k to an IRA so I can’t buy bitcoin with it unless I pay taxes on it first which seems silly. I’ll probably just put it in an ETF long term and put all my extra money in btc. Thanks for answering!
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:57:20
Another issue here is the layman doesn’t even understand how the dollar or fiat works. All they care about is that they work their job, the amount in their account goes up, they can buy more stuff. They don’t or possibly have never heard of our financial system and how it’s a fractional reserve where billionaires and politicians play with debt backed by almost nothing but belief. It’s actually pretty apparent too why it’s not taught anywhere in school except economics in universities - your government and the banks don’t want you to catch wind of what a sham fiat really is.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:07:06
Wow incredible advice. I am going to run the numbers tonight and see what’s better. I’ve already made some profit on it so it’s probably best to sell and get it taxed then buy more bitcoin. Definitely agree that the commodity is much better. Thank you for the info!!
