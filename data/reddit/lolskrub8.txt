It’s meant to grow in stability. Modern currency works almost opposite of bitcoin. That’s why prices are constantly going up. The idea is that bitcoin won’t be like modern currency where we can infinitely print it. That’s also why Bitcoin to FIAT can fluctuate 10% in a day easily without a panic. It’s going to stabilize eventually, and that means that the reward for hodling investors is shrinking as that time comes. So no, it’s not stable right now. The idea is that over time the inflation rate will decrease instead of in places like in Venezuela where it’s skyrocketing. Stability takes time, and bitcoin is pretty much still in its infancy. Hopefully I explained that well, and correctly.

I feel personally attacked. Bitcoin’s prices are sexy though.

If BTC went to 1.8k I might actually be able to have a full one

The chats are pretty good at least. I haven’t interacted with the subreddit as much. And unfortunately, isn’t that true with pretty much anything?

I’m not sure where you’re from, but if you’re in the US, look at exchanging on Coinbase. Pretty low fees. I’m not sure what the other good exchanges there are though so do some research first.

Anytime. It’s a great space to get into, just a bit frustrating at first. Everyone’s super helpful here though so if you have any questions this is definitely the place
