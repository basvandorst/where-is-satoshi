What exchange have you used to cash out? How has your experience been with them EG. How were the fees and did the money take long to hit your account? I'm yet to cash anything out and curious about the process.

I'm super excited for REQ fiat integration for this reason.

I get that it's a currency conversion fee but when you're trying to send a small amount it's ridiculous. I can't wait for crypto to become mainstream

Does anyone know what methods of anti-money-laundering these machines use?  Is there a camera in them? Just a curious thought.

Thanks :)

Do these have a camera in them or any other form of anti money laundering measures?

I also would like to buy a ticket with Bitcoin or any other crypto! Have you considered how the transaction would work without some kind of escrow? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:31:49
Okay well that's my question answered! Thanks

How many Bitcoin are locked up in wallets with lost keys? I heard an estimate of around 4 million. Wpuld this alone stop the price dropping below a certain point because those Bitcoin will never be sold?

Poland actually has a pretty thriving economy these days. If you've ever been to Poland you would also know Polish people are very intelligent and resilient. I'm not sure what their nationality has to do with the quality of their advice...

OTC buy would probably be the most beneficial way for yourself. I would get in touch with a broker. If you're not sure where to start, I know a Youtuber who has mentioned before that he can connect OTC buyers to sellers. His email contact can be found on his YouTube channel

I have been thinking a lot about using Request Network but they are only accepting Eth payments at this stage, once REQ can do Bitcoin and ERC-20 tokens, I will be very excited to implement this option.
