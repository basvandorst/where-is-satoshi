u/soapmakerdelux - what’s the order you bought and received then? 
Raspberry +3
Raspberry Display 
And ......
Fantastic to see another LN - growing everyday!

I see your point - “go google it mate!” Is not a productive nor educational way of guiding - I was commenting more on the gifting to 15 people and creating 15 interest via such gift (however big or small the ₿ gift is) 
I have to admit I have spoken and share my small knowledge on ₿ topics sighing peers and have come to some stage where I say “research it” positively. 
Am for and against the sense of  “go google it” - depend on what context it was given really.

No idea what a raspberry pi is (I have heard and read a few “I have set up my raspberry pi comments”) - I’ll have to look into that (due to laziness does anyone with more knowledge than myself have a good link to some information regarding RASPBERRY PI?
