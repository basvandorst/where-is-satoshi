Without commenting on whether it would have been better for someone else to do this specific presentation, I will de-lurk just to say that it's very hard to hold people to Andreas's standards.
Andreas is one of the finest orators I have ever heard, and easily the best I have ever heard in person. I'm neither a bitcoiner nor a libertarian so I feel I'm relatively unbiased in saying is off the hizzle.

Why provoke our bitcoin friends with sarcastic statements? Of course you are right that for buying a snack it's far more convenient to use cash, and perhaps always will be, but people may still do use cryptocurrency in such contexts for the thrill of trying out something new, and there is nothing wrong with that. Or maybe this guy just forgot to bring cash with him.
I have made some purchases with Bit and Doge that were far more convenient than purchases with cash. e.g. I paid someone online to do a painting of my dog. =)

Though I don't approve of the hostile tone in which subjective_notebook has conducted this discussion, I don't think it's a legitimate tactic to accuse people who disagree with you of being mentally ill. It's also insulting to people who really are mentally ill.
Moolah, you will do much better if you hire a professional PR firm instead of trying to do it yourself. No doubt you're a super-talented dev but you lack aptitude for debates of this sort. It will also give you more time to focus on the things you are good at and at meeting deadlines like the ATM deadline.
