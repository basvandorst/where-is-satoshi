I wonder which Butterfly Labs (former?) employee you are. Hmm. I could take a couple guesses...
What are your thoughts on the Judge dismissing your countersuit against the FTC ? I imagine that's gotta rustle your jimmies a bit, huh ?
@_date: 2015-06-19 06:09:16
Yes. Either way, good luck with that.
    C. TRANSFER IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
    Instead of dismissal, BFL asks the Court to transfer its wrongful injunction counterclaim
    to the Court of Federal Claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1631. BFL contends this counterclaim sounds
    in contract and could have been filed as a separate cause of action in the Court of Federal
    Claims. BFL further argues that a transfer is in the interests of justice.
    Section 1631 allows a court that lacks jurisdiction to transfer the action to a court “in
    which the action . . . could have been brought.” Under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal
    Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over claims that exceed $10,000 in money damages and that
    are founded on “express or implied contract[s] with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(a)(2)
    and 1491(a)(1). Based on the allegations in BFL’s wrongful injunction counterclaim, the Court
    finds that the claim is not a contract claim. Rather, it is a tort claim and is similar to a claim for
    malicious prosecution or abuse of process. See Apply Knowledge, No. 2:14-CV-00088 at Doc.
     at 2 (concluding that “[t]he Sonnenberg Companies’ wrongful injunction claim against the
    FTC does not sound in contract; it sounds in tort, resembling a claim for malicious prosecution
    or wrongful use of civil proceedings”). The Court therefore does not transfer this case under 28
    U.S.C. § 1631. The Court, however, expresses no opinion on the viability of any such claim, and
    this order should not be construed as preventing BFL from bringing a claim against Plaintiff in
    the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. Accordingly, it is hereby
    ORDERED FTC’s Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims (Doc.  is GRANTED. BF
    Labs Inc.’s counterclaims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE for lack of subject-matter
    jurisdiction

The double-standard he selectively applies to others do not apply to himself or his inner circle.
To put it another way, he figuratively allows certain people to get away with murder.
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:49:48
Yes, Butterfly Labs sponsored the show, at the very least, by providing them mining gear to mine the Bitcoins used to give away on the show... or something like that.

PG and I have had our differences in the past over this matter, but I can't believe he's "in bed" with Butterfly Labs.
We "lost PG" for a while after this dinner, where Sonny and Josh must have fed him some magic kool-aid, but thankfully snapped out of it after several months.
I don't always agree with Phin's methods or behavior (who am I to judge), but I have to admire his tenacity for digging for facts and truths, and have to think he genuinely means well.
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:46:23
Theymos has lost all credibility being a "most trusted" member of the community with the way he runs Bitcointalk.org, and his double-standards allowing for scams and dubious schemes to tarnish the Bitcoin community.
It is an outrage indeed that one person has so much control over the community.

*"I understand that there may be a large contingency of people who do not believe what I posted earlier or will not believe it until they see it in the news or a government agency confirms it. But I hold in my hands a 33 page ex parte temporary restraining order filed by the FTC against BFL on 9/18/14 that names three individuals associated with BFL in it, specifically. I am not releasing it at this time for two reasons: 1) the person who gave it to me hasn't given me the permission yet, 2) it says "**Sealed**" on the bottom of the page next to the case number. I believe the fact that it is sealed is the reason government agencies have not commented on it at this point.*
*I went by BFL for the first time in a year today to see what was going on as well after I heard the news and I didn't see any agents, however I have received confirmation this afternoon from another completely independent source who was scheduled to have a meeting with BFL today before it was abruptly cancelled who went by and ran into agents there. This other source is a reliable and established name in the Bitcointalk forum and they can back up my claim publicly if they wish to, but I am not pushing them. I know what I have seen and heard from my sources and people can believe what they want until it is officially confirmed."*
*"As to what Tech... is posting is all 100% factually true, I cannot be completely sure. I can confirm that Tech... is former BFL, just as I am. Tech..'s initial info from the same sources from whom I received my info, since my source told me that they had also spoken with Tech.... Nobody is pulling your legs here. This shit happened. Now, the US Marshals KC office was denying any connection to this action at least as of 4:30 pm CST, but they may have had reasons to withhold that info temporarily. I'm not too familiar with the US Marshal Service's protocol. Still, they entered the office around 10 am CST, and had employees leave all computers and any other equipment, files, and basically whatever wasn't personal property. They interviewed employees, too. I won't go into the nature of those interviews as reported to me, since I'm sure all of that will be disclosed in the case ahead. There have supposedly been two arrests. I believe there is at least one additional warrant at this, and it will be rather hard to serve.*
*There's a group of BFL ex-pats who, while employed at BFL, believed that company was doing things in so many wrong ways that it was difficult to keep count. IF you voiced dissent (and god could I tell you stories - I'm somewhat combative, which Tech.. can attest to, if he figures out who I am lol), your days were numbered. Tech... and I were not the best of friends, but got on well, and had at least some level of respect for each other. Tech... isn't the type to jump on and feed the community a bunch of bullshit. Sure, I've seen some ranting  and venting, and maybe even some posts that were written without the backing of solid info, but those are few.*
*This is no bullshit. BFL is being taken to task."*

I have no reason to think this raid is made up, based on two seemingly independent confirmations, as well as Butterfly Labs not directly answering the inquiries.
Josh Z: "*We typically don't comment on bitcoin talk rumors or speculation*."
The truth is, Josh has made it part of his career over the last 2-3 years of trolling Bitcointalk, doxxing it's critics, and talking about rumors and speculation at great smug and patronizing lengths, so this is a very telling post by him.
Come on tell me I'm a liar.

Sorry, but given the history of what goes on at Bitcointalk.org, it's fully justified IMO.
We'll just need to disagree on this point, and I would urge you to dig deeper into the history of Theymos and Bitcointalk before claiming it's unjustified.

Josh Zerlan's generous distribution of ill-gotten gains to Theymos, in the form of forum advertising for Butterfly Labs on BitcoinTalk, has taught Theymos a thing or two about being a crook, huh ?
Personally, here's hoping Theymos gets pulled into this BFL legal action currently going on.
