(I saw this post on the pregnancy subreddit and here I am!)
Not entirely true. Odds are, insurance won't cover the entire cost of the pregnancy/labour and depending where one lives, that can add up to be a fair amount (when my husband and I lived in NYC, it would have cost us $6-8k in just hospital fees).
I'm an expat in the UK now, but here are some expenses we're incurring due to my pregnancy (which was a privately funded IVF pregnancy after 2 years of trying)--remember, all my medical expenses are covered through NHS over here:
* Prenatal vitamins
* Maternity clothes (including undergarments...her breasts will swell!)
* Slightly larger grocery bill per week (maybe 25 GBP extra per week) due to intolerance/cravings of some foods--I couldn't eat meat in my first trimester at all!
* Nursery furniture (inc. changing table, crib, bassinet/moses basket, perhaps a dresser and glider)
* Nursery bedding, including crib liners
* Black-out curtains (or shade)
* Clothing (though you will get a lot as gifts): onesies, hats, mittens, swaddling blankets, burp cloths
* Diaper bag/portable changing pad
* Stroller/carrier
* Car seat
* Silly misc. things like toys and books (though you will get a lot as gifts presumably)
* Baby bath
* Diapers, baby lotion, diaper rash ointment, baby wipes, baby soap etc ad nauseum in endless quantities
* For post labour, OP's wife will need pads, new underwear most likely (as bleeding will ruin old ones)--she may need other things depending on how it goes
Then, how will you feed the baby? Breastfeeding requires a lot of breast pads, a breast pump if she plans on expressing (a must for working mothers), breast milk bottles (which are sometimes different than regular ones). If she uses formula, then you have the price of formula. But you will most likely need a bottle brush, a steriliser will make your life substantially easier, bottle insulator etc.
So it's not just diapers and things like that--there are a lot more expenses for your first baby, even if you get a lot of gifts. After the *initial* cost of having a baby and preparing for it, though, I can see how it may balance out a bit more though.
For OP:
It's never the right time to have a baby. Even though my spouse and I are financially secure, given our careers it will never be great. If you have enough money to take care of a child and you want it, do it. These opportunities don't come up every day. And you never know how long you will be trying--we're in our 20s and in excellent health and it still took me two years and IVF to conceive. If you keep banking on, 'It'll be better tomorrow', you'll never do anything in life.
Good luck, and I wish you all the best!
