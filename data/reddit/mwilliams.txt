Not for long.  First NFC enabled phones shipping on the 19th.  Vendors accepting Apple Pay in October.  I've already received emails from Chase specifying my accounts are Apple Pay ready and I live in a pretty small town and I'm aware of at least half a dozen places that will be accepting it based on the initial list of vendors available on day one.

For what it's worth, [Apple dropped DRM a longgggg time ago...]( but, this is so whatever.

While I don't think he's at all blinking morse code (vs the POW blinking the word torture while giving a forced confession video that gets posted weekly that's WAY more obvious). 
But hey, check out and for real morse code!

Has anyone done a security audit on [their code](  Is there anything not published to Github that's been deployed between the website and the plugin?

This isn't Android.  Unless you use a third party keyboard on iOS (which when you load, they tell you the risks involved).  Apps are sandboxed in such a way to prevent other apps from capturing keystrokes, or images without granting access.  Not to mention it such malware would need to be installed via the App Store vs Android where someone could easily and ignorantly sideload malware unknowingly.  Transaction specific codes (see below) are generated for each purpose.  And let's say for argument sake that something does happen.  You simply call your credit card company, report the fraud and reverse the charges.  


Your name, your credit card number, the details of the purchase are not shared with the vendor.

bitcoin client, exchange, or online wallet


Typos (pointed out below) and grammar issues (should be "you're" and "from" in the above sentences)... 
Instructions are also pretty confusing.  Start over, perhaps crowd source the material and have others review it for spelling/grammar.

What's your QA process for releasing new software?  This comment is pretty concerning. How did the code that introduced these regressions make it out into production?
Simply curious, no ill will or snark intended.

That's not too far from the truth.

Well, everyone reacts differently, so it's fair warning. 
That said, interesting read indeed..

Having lived in Hawaii and had an office that was just a few minute walk from this property - it's not 5 star by any means.  As soon as you get off the strip and go a street or two from the water, it gets pretty dirty and cheap.  
If you want 5-star, take a look at the Moana Surfrider.
Also, if you want to live in Hawaii, I'd advise you keep out of Honolulu and Waikiki - super touristy and busy.  Plenty of great places and empty beaches elsewhere on the island that are quiet, and have better/cheaper/more local food.

Yep - getting a nice place in Kailua would be best while spending your days at Lanikai beach where it's 100% nicer and 100% less crowded.
Man, I really miss living in Hawaii!

Give the above comments a read and think long and hard about this decision.

Simple is really fantastic.  I just verified a Coinbase account and when my verification deposits landed, I got this nice email from Simple.






Very slick.  Simple has a ways to go (like join accounts), but so far so good and happy to hear they won't fuss with Bitcoin (though I just linked to Coinbase for kicks, no plans on any serious BTC purchases in the near future).

iOS 7 Beta isn't meant for primetime usage.  Be a good citizen and report bugs to Apple and the developers of the app, but you can't reasonably expect anything to work right on the Beta - it's meant for developers who are testing applications of their own.

These are honest questions by the way, I'm genuinely curious.  Not trolling.
I understand it's a hobby, but it's a device that you plug in and ignore - there's no interaction.  At one point it had the potential to mine an amount of BTC that was potentially worth something.
Running numbers through a calculator, it appears you'll be lucky if it can mine $1-$2/month (at today's BTC -&gt; USD rate), over the next few months.  Then maybe $0.50/month, etc etc.
Where's the hobby aspect?  The go to justification I see when people are buying block erupters is "to support the network" - but you can do that without spending $15, the rock bottom price I've seen, which has gone up, cashing in on those unfamiliar to mining and hoping to make a quick buck (not to mention needing a nice USB hub if you're running a bunch of them).
I could see a block erupter for a few bucks (literally a few, $2 tops?) being fun to pick up, but otherwise, $20 worth a BTC seems like a much better way to enjoy BTC as a hobby.
Anyway, if you have a source for dirt cheap block erupters, that's great, and if you don't and still snag them, that's OK too.  I just get curious every time I see the mention of them.

It's everything but the real scoop.  It's a very focused tour that's under constant watch.  You're not free to travel the country or go unattended (except at the hotel, which I believe is on an island of sorts).  
That said - it would be fascinating, but all money spent to get there and that the DPRK receives is likely going straight to the pockets of all the people who sit and watch the population starve to death and oversee all the labor camps.
I'd highly recommend watching the episode of [Departures, where they film their trip to the DPRK](
There's also the [VICE Guide to North Korea]( which is a lot more slanted in the direction of "wow, this place is nuts!" whereas the Departures tour tries to appear a lot more reasonable.
All things considered - if I had the opportunity, I'd go in a heartbeat...

| Bitcoin is an _obscure_ currency
You'd have an infinitely easier time swapping those American dollars for your native currency.  Oh, and those American dollars aren't as likely to have the chance to be worth 150% less than when you were given them.
Having to hunt down someone who's willing to exchange them, most likely in person, for the $5-$10 they're maybe worth is a stupid thing to make a person go through.  
Tip BTC on top of the local currency and move along.

Why on earth would you buy block erupters at this point?
