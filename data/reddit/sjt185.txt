Do you think it will close above 9k on the week? I didn't buy anything this dip because nothing happened to warrant a reversal. We still don't know what regulation will look like, so i'm hesitant to buy BTC and alts now because the SEC/CFTC could just say all unregulated securities have to be delisted, and all unregulated exchanges are illegal in US. A bit harsh, but the uncertainty is still there. Psychologically speaking, i'm trying not to feel the FOMO right now but looking at this logically, the uncertainty is still there. I watched the FEB 5-6 dip come and go without buying, and now this one. Maybe I should have bought a little bit during both. Oh well.

The bulk of her fans are 35-50 year old women. I can't see them jumping onto a bittrex, bitstamp, coinbase, or binance and executing trades and then transferring those trades to a ledger wallet or myetherwallet. For mass adoption to happen, the exchanges need to adapt (dumb it down) for the majority of people to feel comfortable using them. Watch crypto bobby's interview with Michael Oved (Founder of Airswap, decentralized exchange) he explains what needs to happen for mass adoption to happen in regards to regular joe's and institutional investors. In his opinion, they will not currently touch the existing exchanges. Im not trying to bash the ecosystem or anything like that. I think its great that Ellen promoted bitcoin and crypto, however, a lot needs to change before the "herd" comes. Just my opinion though. Have a great day everyone!

Hey Sean Murray,
Just curious to know why you think we are in a bear market. I am new to crypto, and in the process of learning technical analysis. Although, the learning curve is pretty intense, I think understanding TA in the long run is really helpful. Of course its pretty impossible to time the market, but understanding the potential for a run and dip is pretty valuable. So, just curious as to why you would hold for a dip right now.
