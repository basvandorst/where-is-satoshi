Entropy is completely relative, a billion long gibberish numbers compress great so long as they are in the right order, or they are selected from a small set or add-infinitum.
The only relevant question is how much data is there really in the block-chain ? and i DARE say its a tiny amount.

You obviously know nothing about how Bitcoin works,
1. Transaction time is meaningless - confirmation time ( a measurement of security ) is sufficiently HIGH.
2. The profit of Mining will always be exactly identical (25 coin every 10 minutes ) after all new coins are found a small transaction fee will be introduced which provides the one lucky miner every 10 minutes with his coins.
3. All decentralized computer networks scale absolutely great.
4. Dominant Mining pools are not a problem, the 51% attack is not a problem, long invalid block chains ARE NOT A PROBLEM. you obviously have not read how the actual protocol works... i suggest /wiki/cryptocurrency as further reading.

Well dells sorted

Well there you go, cant trust em
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:26:29
Thanks for that observation Banana Pro!. I wasn't gonna mention it but yes!, it does seem like a lot of people don't know jack.
Remind us; what doesn't scale about decentralised networks?
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:46:26
hehehe, true that. you're pretty likeable : )
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:30:48
All good, you seem ridiculously reasonable on reread, sorry for throwing mud have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-07-04 11:14:58
Yes, i am challenged primarily mentally... challenged to workout just wtf people are talking about with this  last -n blocks gibberish.
You cant just check any old block... you need to check the block which contains the transaction in which the current sender received his bitcoins.
There is no shortening the blockchain... you might be processing a transaction from a guy who has never been part of the chain since the first block.
I don't know you, but i know you seem to think there is meaningfull logic in something there is not.. i am btw very interested, if you can actually explain logically how to chance the protocol to remove the chain.
Also you cannot over-write blocks that's again gibberish... you can influence miners to work on your chain if yours in sufficiently longer.. but you cant go back and change what is written in someone elses chain.
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:52:49
You are a fool, the last N blocks do not correspond to the last N steps some coins have followed.. you cannot implement ANYTHING like this, you are talking complete smack... you are yet another person you cant tell where the wallet protocol ends and the mining protocol begins.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:36:37
Very Good point. Very well made.
@_date: 2014-08-31 10:43:37
What a freaking great article !
Loved the whole things, super relevant !

Fiat-Bitcoins YOU FUCKING WISH BUDDY BAHAHAH.
bitcoin is realcoin and bankers are gonna have to pay thru the nose to get it.
( and there are too many bakers for them all to get reasonable prices.. you fiat trash in going bye-bye )
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:51:12
You can't, i know alot of people who thought this is possible... but if you actually sit down with them you find they don't know what the fuck they are talking about.
You could crunch away the blocks if you keep the transactions... but the blocks only contain the transactions which means they are all but completely compressible anyway.
Again the problem is data layout.. the blockchain contains VERY little information.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:20:56
What are you smoking... CRACK ?
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:54:21
Why are you trying to use the full wallet on a lil piece of shit ?
Bitcoin is as secure as we make it... you cannot expect much without a harddrive... use a light wallet as mentioned.
@_date: 2014-08-31 13:13:44
It sure will ; )

The "bitcoin network" is a massive group of mutually distrustful miners.
Private hubs are no more a part of the bitcoin system than McDonals-American is a part of the federal reserve system.... Looking at the behavior of privately motivated third party system users is not any kind of way to judge the merits of the the underlying system itself.
Mt Gox was simply greedy, their behavior was not motivated by properties of the "bitcoin network" itself and for that reason the affair was quite rightfully left-out from the documentary.

It's more like 'space-ship needs hole-to-let-air-in!' in this case.
@_date: 2014-07-15 08:46:40
Damn good question !
@_date: 2014-07-04 09:48:33
You are a complete noob don't post anything ever again, asics all work by taking advantage of the extreme task level coherence inherent in the shar256 process.
There is no general way to increase useful computation speed, there is only general ways to remove redundancy.
I don't really want to explain universality to a noob... just take it on faith that there are multiple simple and concise ways to make asic mining infeasible.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:26:02
Actually. it Would be exactly as [possible] to 'effectively forbid' Bitcoins as it would be to 'effectively forbid' people from connecting to torrent meeting places and downloading whatever - game - movie - song or piece of software that catches their fancy.
Your dead right that governments cannot regulate the Bitcoin protocol and That is exactly All Bitcoin is.
My filthy handed, tired and confused friend you can most certainly not, touch that shit.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:12:48
You are a Noob, 'regulation' is the Nicest possible term for wealth funneling. when new identical bills of money enter an economy, the value of each bill decreases proportionally, thankly dilemmas such don't even make sense in a limited currency cryptographic economy, have a nice day.

miners are nodes.
@_date: 2014-08-22 13:10:13
Actually your just a dick-head.
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:39:25
you would have to be pretty uninformed nowadays to not know how much bitcoin has risen and risen.
Feb 2010 – $0.01
Jun 2010 - $0.08 
Feb 2011 – $1
Jul 2011 - $31
Apr 2013 - $266
May 2014 - $440/$630

Brilliant, so accurate !

Realcoin is a pathetic excuse, it is a worthless rip off and anyone who thinks over-wise is lying or a fool.
@_date: 2014-08-12 08:34:24
Actually, although a huge number of miners around the world are actively working to extend the block-chain; in reality almost all of that work is redundant.
At the end of each (~10 minute) mining round, the block which was signed first does not contain much information, and all other blocks are simply dropped.
Miners do not Need local copies the block chain in order to sign/work.
Also storage capacity is asymptoting - 
There really is no reason to think that there is any kind of fundamental problem with Bitcoins implementation.
As far as computer networks go - decentralization and wide distribution are very beneficial.

mt gox has nothing todo with the network, that was a greedly lying japanese man and it's not unique to bitcoin.
Bitcoin ( as a protocol, and that's exactly what it is ) should no more be blamed for the incident at mt gox. than Money should be blamed for the violence and drug trafficking purposes which gangsters use it for.

Brilliant writeup.
Spot on and very interesting !
@_date: 2014-07-25 06:34:09
A bitcoin node? you obviously mean a mining node.
To use bitcoin one only needs a light wallet which requires no local block-chain.
If your a miner, cry harder 25 gigs in nothing.
