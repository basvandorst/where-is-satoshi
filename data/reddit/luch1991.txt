I would personally wait. I think we at least test 7800-8000 before going back up. Buy some now and keep some fiat in reserve Incase we drop more. I’m personally waiting for around 6k. I don’t see enough panic on Reddit and twitter yet which usually means we’re going lower before going back up.

The time to buy was December/January. I’ll buy more if we test the 5800-6200 levels.

But what potential newcomers know about Bitcoin halving if they even know what Bitcoin is? There is no guarantee that history will repeat itself. A bunch of fomoers buying 100$ worth of Bitcoin won’t move the market.
What started the big move this year was a single purchase of 100 millions $ spread across 3 separate exchanges which eventually led to the price increasing  from 4k to just about 14k in several months time.
All of 2018 everyone here and on /CC was calling for another bull run at the end of the year like in 2017 and it led to a huge dump around the time the moon boys thought they were getting there lambos. 
I’m not saying there won’t be a pump but just that no one has a clue what will happen leading up to the halving. The market is very different today then it was 4 years ago. A lot more manipulators then there previously was. I believe in the price long term but short term we could head to 3K again very easily. When everyone is convinced that Bitcoin will have a big move (either up or down) it almost always does the opposite.

Loll it’s funny how every time CNBC says something the opposite always happens.

Anon’s prediction is already 3/3 because they called the exact bottom which would make it the first prediction. So 16k in October would make it the 4th.

A dip would be under 7k, we’ve been in this range for a few months now.

It might just skip the large dump. Many people were predicting a bull run eoy 2018 which was a big dump instead. I’m seeing a lot of people expecting a large dump now before the bullrun takes off. We might go straight to bull market.

You can buy with a visa debit card with RBC, I’ve already contacted them concerning this. That leaves coinbase as the only option through most banks. Using e-transfer still works but at the risk of having your bank account closed using other exchanges.
