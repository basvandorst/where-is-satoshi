Basically what you said is correct. If you'd had your btc in a place that supported the fork (literally even a paper wallet would have worked) you would have your bitcoin and bitcoin cash. I think CoinBase will give us the after all cash though.

I had some of my coin in my CB wallet the day of and after the fork (yes I know dumb move). I have since moved it to a different exchange, will CB still give me the Bitcoin Cash I would have? I still have my CB account of course, I currently have some litecoin there.

You could always just buy your coin somewhere else and transfer to Kraken

Then just use Coinbase.

Thank you, that is impressive, did you do that with python by chance? I'm not really in a position throw around much money ATM, but you are right I could definitely play around the market with 15-20$ just to learn on plus it will encourage me to do more research.

Well yeah, but you can't get good at something without gaining experience now can you.

 I was just considering posting about this but I had a feeling the idea will get shot down here. I think we would need to know the best place to trade quickly with low transaction fees.

Thanks, so far I've traded via localbitcoin and Coinbase but this has a lot more options for me to research.
