While I support you on this posting, your comment is false. 51,000 people can be wrong.
For example you could find 51,000 adults who couldn't multiply 13 by 14...

This whole post is essentially me saying "I'm an idiot, help me learn". Pretty sure I'm aware of it.

The "files can still be found on the HD" thing is usually within like a few hours, with no power applied. You're out of luck without backups of some sort man.

Nope the stocks have been treating me pretty well, but its not been too difficult in the past few years since the crash to do well to some degree. I read as a hobby, I go home after a day of work and read tech blogs until sleep. The opinions I come across just happen to also be indicative of tech stocks. I'm not interested in finance as a job. I prefer to make things.

Stocks return dividends. They're value is based in the revenue and profit generated by the represented company and an expectation that more value is generated. Speculation in currencies also occurs (which in my opinion would have been a better analogy on your part) but they are on a scale where spending said currency is not affected, at least, by day to day changes in the market defined value.
If one potential end to all this speculation is that holding on to a currency is more valuable than spending said currency,
what is the currency worth in the end? 
If the only worth of bitcoin is that it is considered to have worth (as opposed to actually having transactional uses, like it should), when it is not longer considered to have an inherent use, what is it worth? A correction of some form must occur at some stage where a balance is attained.

Because the % rises have been pretty large and that kind of stuff can't be ignored either regardless of your stance on it. That and I'm a lot better at predicting falls than rises. Bitcoin though, the falls I expect under normal circumstances just. don't. happen. 
And I want to improve my prediction skills by learning from it :)
On a side note I'm expecting a mild-ish fall in twitter in the short term (not as far as inital IPO prices though, will remain above that) with a recovery in the long term once they get their profits in order.

After half a year and by the looks of it usage has occured over that span of time:


It's likely at least some of that wallet has been written over and corrupted the data. If he has used it less than what my guess is... maybe... but tis still a long shot. I'm not saying don't try, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up.
