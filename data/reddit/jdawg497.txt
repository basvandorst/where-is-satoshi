Can someone evaluate this link. Was pm’d by someone guaranteeing 50-60 percent returns daily on btc which is obviously a scam. The person sent me this link and I’m skeptical on clicking it. What is this website? What is it about? Is it real? Was he trying to convince me to believing him by proving a legitimate website? Thanks for the help.

Does anyone know of any good articles or videos or anything like that that are current and informative/convincing that I could show to someone with very little knowledge about bitcoin? Thanks

What are alternatives to cb pro? 
I have heard of voyager but am unsure of the fee policy. If someone knows can they please explain the fee policy of voyager with withdraw fees.

Does anyone know the fees of voyager? I know it’s commission-less but are they’re any withdraw fees or anything like that? Trying to figure out alternatives to cb pro now
