They should kick Ver out of the USA...oh wait.

Makes total sense. I guess at the end of the day you can recover things with your seed words, so you can buy a new one.
Thank you for confirming.

Definitely. I (silently) made the assumption that a hardware wallet user would likely purchase another hardware wallet if they lost their old one. :)

I'm new here. Possibly moving to the UK within the next 12 months, so debating if I move my money over there via bitcoin. Beats forex.

Damn! I ended up ordering a Trezor directly from them. Arrived in Western Canada from the Czech Republic in 3 days.

Would be sad/funny if the "DEA" turned out to be fake agents and just jacked buddy's cash.
On a more serious note. Could they theoretically confiscate a trezor/ledger nano (despite not being able to access them)?

True. I wanted to get my coins off of online wallets as quickly as possible, so went the route of the Trezor.

I am a newbie to this stuff too and am in a similar position. I ended up buying a Trezor and moving my BTC over to it. I was reading so much about some exchanges potentially screwing the pooch during the hard fork (possibly taking a while to actually give users the new coin, or who knows what else!). Furthermore, you don't technically OWN the BTC until you get it off the exchanges. I've been reading some horror stories, so even my small amount of BTC has be wary of storing it online (apart from Bitcoin Core if you are running it).
From what I understand, the hard fork will end up giving BTC users an equal amount of the new coin. The bigger question is how/when we would get said new coins depending how/where your BTC is stored. I'm still figuring that part out. :)
Best of luck!

I'm a newb, but this is on my list this weekend. Got a desktop and a vacant laptop. F*ck 2x.

Well I'm up 10-14% on what I put in, therefore I made some money, no? :)
I guess it matters what you consider 'making money' to be. For me it's "am I making more than if I left the money in my bank account, invested elsewhere, etc.", but everyone's definitions (especially when it comes to money!) are different.

I bought in 2-3 weeks ago and the price is up $700 (CAD) so far. Sure it's volatile, but far better returns than I could've expected from stocks in the same time frame. I'm hodling but already can't complain...yet.

What wallets allow you to own your own key? Hardware and Bitcoin Core only, or are there others?
