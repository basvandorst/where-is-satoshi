BitcoinCore devs disagree.

Well said.

Be careful, i heard rumors that u cant downgrade from 0.15

I don't get it, mempool is almost empty yestoday.
If 1MB is 1 block, does 12MB mempool mean we Only mine 1 Block in 2 hours?

I guess it's up to exchabges to decide which coin they support, they can't support both because replay. And users will always polute the minority chain.

Thees attacks can only happen under the full block policy employed by Core, which means making bitcoin operating  near its capacity.
The root cause is demand surpass supply,  not who the attacker is.

Got it. So everything is fine.

peak desperate?

Spamming the mempool with high fee txs is just like donating to other miners, unless u control 100% of mining power.
Stop the high-fee spaming nonsense!
Accept the fact that bitcoin has grown to the stage when 1MB is not enough Even with $5 average fees.

Satoshi left because he thought he didn't suit a public highlighted bitcoin. 
I think Greg and his buddies have the same feeling that they are not able to handle next stage of bitcoin. 
Wish them luck.

They never sorted out the priorities.

After watching the video, it Sounds like that OP is using misleading title here.
Alex did not say they will mine Core after 2x, that's just Jimmy putting his mouth.
James says he is mining Bitcoin 'cuttently', and Jimmy 'complement' it with 'after the fork'.
And Kevin owns no mining rigs, he's just cheerleading, people love it.

People who really work for free are not working at all, contributes nothing. If they work for free，they must gain somthing. Power? Control?   
Don't be naive, there's no free lunch. FOSS owns you.

Mainly because miners are adding hashpower:
Segwit only caused 1% block increase after 2 weeks since activation:
This sub really like cheerleading.

Every exchange is dealing with altcoins, many Core devs are altcoin fans, why should miners be damned because they finally got an altcoin to mine?
Top Core devs are pushing people away by limiting the blocksize, pushing up fees,killing off usecases. 
That's the problem.

I doubt that. Techies usually are not hodlers, because they believe their skills are the most valuable assets in bitcoin ecosystem, they could always 'create bitcoin 2.0' .
I guess most of them sold out their  bitcoins, that's why they are so uncooperative, risking splitting the ecosystem when most biz&amp;miners strongly require a minor blocksize bump. 
They call big blockers 'get rich quick guy', that says something.

Why don't you mention that Coinbase, Bitpay and many other major Businesses agree on NYA?  They all agree. The only major entity that  disagree is Core.
NYA is an olive branch to Bitcoin Core : "We give u segwit, at least double the limit".

Coinbase serves 10 million users.They can spin up 10 million nodes if needed, but no, normal users should just use hardware/mobile wallets.
Users &lt;&gt; Nodes. 
You raspberry pi node means nothing to the network, the hashrate&amp;stake behind it matters.

You mean doubling by 1.7% after 3 weeks? Or doubling in 2 years?
