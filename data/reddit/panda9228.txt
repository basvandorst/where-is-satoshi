There are 0 wallets that received 10k+ bitcoins in early 2010 and remain untouched today.  It's possible the original seller stole the coins back long before OP though to even look for them.  Or also possible he only bought 1,000 as he suggested.
More likely is the story is fabricated the story.  The interesting thing is you can actually analyse this likelihood using statistical theory.
I'm not going to use specific numbers since they would be guesses anyway, but it basically works like this.  Consider the chances this story actually happened to someone in the world and they are writing about it today - certainly reasonable that there are a handful, but not hundreds or anything near that.
Now consider the number of people on reddit who have thought about these kind of scenarios, and might post a story like this out of boredom.  Literally anyone could make the story up, so we are talking millions of potential people.  Besides boredom, a huge motivation for these stories is to receive handouts.  Directly begging for coins has a very low success rate, but detailed and specific sympathy stories which DON'T ask for coins have a much higher success rate at getting handout donations.
(Interestingly, in-person the reverse tends to be true.  People donate money for two reasons: 1) to feel good about themselves and 2) to not feel bad about themselves.  In person, the 2nd factor is very strong when being directly approached 1-on-1 by a person.  The experience of having to lie, ignore them, or say no is very unpleasant for most.  Simply giving a dollar is the preferred route.  In person it is usually more effective to beg for money rather than sit with a bucket/sign and not ask.  However on the internet, you have a broad audience and are not directly addressing any one person.  When you address a crowd or audience, nobody feels singled out or responsible, so they don't feel the need to donate to avoid   And nobody wants to donate to an annoying beggar, so they don't get donations for   But someone with a good sob story will SOMETIMES get someone to donate for   The success rate is still low, but could potentially be large in a space like crypto.  And with a wide enough audience you may end up getting a bite).
Point is, most people read these posts and think "well it's reasonable this happened to someone, so I tend to believe this is a real story".  The reality is, while the story could be true, it is much more LIKELY to be made up.  Simply from a statistical probability perspective.  There are millions of people who could write this story falsely and have reason to do so.  There are only (maybe) a handful of people who could write this story truthfully.  It's simply going to be fabricated a VAST majority of the time.
Not an attack on OP, I don't care if it's true or his reasons for posting.  Just an interesting note on how probabilities and likelihoods work in these situations.

Yeah this question is odd because these things aren't really comparable.  But can explain what they are.
Segwit is simply an update the bitcoin code.  It's like when Windows does an update.  These happen periodically as the programmers fix bugs and implement new features.  Segwit is an important update for several reasons, but one of the primary reasons is that it gives bitcoin some new flexibility and capabilities.  One specifically capability is Lightning Network (LN).
LN is a totally new network apart from the bitcoin network.  However, the two networks are tied together.  LN is not a blockchain network, unlike bitcoin which is.  As a result, LN can potentially allow for far higher transaction volume and lower fees than bitcoin.  But LN cannot simply operate on it's own.  Without tying itself to bitcoin, LN would have little-to-no security.  As such, we say that LN is built "on top" of the bitcoin network.  The currency in LN is still bitcoins, because all the tokens on LN are backed one-to-one by actual bitcoins.  It's simply using a new protocol to more easily transact the highly-secure bitcoins.  Bitcoin can and will still operate without LN as it does today.  But LN is intended to be a new option for users to transact their bitcoins more quickly and cheaper.
BTC is bitcoin, which is kind of the umbrella that all these things fall under.  You could say that traditional BTC is the non-segwit bitcoin code, but segwit is still bitcoin.
BCH (bitcoin cash) is a fork from bitcoin, which doesn't use segwit.  This could be thought of as traditional bitcoin, which some users believe.  A majority of users feel this direction is not-optimal for bitcoin, and that is reflected in the market prices.  Bitcoin cash allows for much bigger blocks with the hope of keeping fees small and transactions quick.  This solution is short-sighted in the eyes of many, and additionally there are suspicions about the primary motives behind the actors pushing for BCH.
Coinbase is just an exchange service which users can transact USD with a few different cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, ETH and BCH.  Coinbase is focused on being user-friendly and accepts credit card deposits.
Gdax is part of the coinbase company.  Anyone with a coinbase account can access the Gdax section if they wish, but can stick to the simple coinbase exchange services if they wish.  The advantages of Gdax is that it is a proper exchange with all the typical features and lower fees.  It is a bit more complicated to use but is recommended over the coinbase exchange for anyone buying or selling any remotely significant amount of money.

1. The block reward tapers off gradually over several decades.  After that the rewards is only the mining fees, which presumably become the main portion of the total rewards long before then.  So the transition from "new minted btc reward" to "transaction fee btc rewards" is also gradual.
2. Anyone can change the code or release updates.  Nobody can unilaterally get those updates ACCEPTED by the whole network.  It requires a majority of the network to run the update. (Think democracy.  Anyone can put forth a petition but it requires many people to vote "yes" for a change in the law).
3. Yes there would still be energy being used for verifying blocks after all coins are mined.  The same process is used.  Processing transfers is essentially the same as mining.  There is some energy used to run full nodes I suppose, but the vast majority of energy uses is on miners supporting the network.

Channels do close, yes.  Either party can close a channel at any time.  There is an on-chain transaction to open the channel, and another to close it.
Opening a channel gives you access to many, if not all of the LN participants.  So in theory you will be able to open a channel, then send and receive many payments - quickly and cheaply.  Eventually you may simply spend all your LN "credits" and the other party may choose to close the stagnant channel and collect the BTC.  Or someone might close before then.  Whenever it closes though, that is the 2nd on-chain transaction which gives blockchain finality to the aggregate of all the transactions which occurred on the channel while it was open.

Not sure what you mean.
A Put is an options contract.  There are markets to trade options which have already been issued, so yes you can sell your Put anytime in these markets.  I believe options are deliverable anytime before their expiration.  If you wanted to exercise them early (in March for one which expires in July, for example) you are allowed to.  It just makes no sense to do so.
Here's why:  
If an asset is worth $100 you might buy a Put with $90 strike price.  Say the price drops to $80.  Great!  You exercise early and take your $10 profit per share.
Say instead, you decide to simply buy shares at $80 and continue holding the options.  If the price plummets, you are unaffected because you still exercise your option and sell for $90 (again $10 profit).  However if instead the asset recovers and is worth $110 by the expiration date, it makes more sense to simply let it expire.  In this case you can sell for $30 profit.
You can see that it is always better to leave your options open (this isn't really a pun, it's the reason they are called options).
I think what you are asking is if you can sell your options early to cash in on the profit.  Yes you can.  As I showed above you can buy the underlying asset now and guarantee at least $10 profit, if not more.  So your option would trade for something like $15 or $20 on the market.

You are acting as if it's impossible to send someone bitcoin.  They are perfectly transferable, it just costs a small fee.  You understand it has value if it functions as a currency which can buy things.  But not if it only used as an asset (with many advantages over comparable assets) to store large amounts of value?  Why?
And regarding the intrinsic value of gold, it's extremely low.  Like maybe $5 per ounce for electronic usage.  And if you think it's value in jewelry is intrinsic, we can easily produce far more interesting metals.  In today's age, people mostly enjoy gold jewelry because it is a sign of wealth.

There is only one direct answer that is correct:  The demand (buying) has outpaced the supply (selling).

I am pro-crypto, and I do agree fiat isn't the best long-term store of value, but...
Fiat is an instrument which does facilitate a lot for an economy.  I mean this is a 100-year graph.  Cryptos aren't even 1/10th as old.  The two serve different purposes.  Investors have always stayed away from storing considerable wealth in fiat, but move them into stocks, bonds, property, and other assets.  Yet fiat continues to serve a purpose.
Cryptos are an emerging asset class, and as such it has been wise to transfer wealth into it while it is still in its infancy.  The more likely reality is in 10 years where your financial adviser will inquire about your cash reserves, home equity, stocks/bonds, and *crypto* assets.
As long as there are states there will be fully functioning fiat currencies to facilitate the economy.

*How is Bitcoin ever to be adopted as a realistic store of value/currency with its current level of volatility in an open market place?*
The most basic (and I believe correct) answer is that it's still very new, and much of the value is based on speculation rather than utility.  To draw a parallel, Amazon didn't earn any profit/dividend for investors for 10+ years.  But people believed they would in the future.  Buyer speculated on this fact so the price of their stock kept rising during this time.
Additionally, bitcoin is a different type of asset.  Most people don't store their entire wealth in dollars as it is.  They own houses, stocks, and such.  Those assets fluctuate.  How do individuals function if their asset portfolio goes from $500,000 to $300,000 in a recession?  Well, it's difficult.  Most people continue earning and hopefully investing in a diverse set of assets.
Bitcoin simply is what it is.  It exists and individuals have shown an interest in holding/using it for a variety of reasons.  There is evidence to show that as it exists in it's current state, it is being adopted.  Your question is much like asking "How can we expect fish to survive if they don't have legs?"  If you see that fish are thriving in the world, perhaps the question should be "Why are fish able to survive without legs?"
*How is Bitcoin (or more likely smaller cryptocurrencies) resistant against market manipulation?*
It is not, as we have clearly seen.  But again you are supposing that "an asset susceptible to market manipulation will not be well received."  I can assure you there has been plenty of market manipulation in bitcoin and crypto since it's inception.  I'm not saying it's a good thing, but simply that it seems to be inherent to any unregulated market.  Regulation may or may not change in the future.  It's also likely that the effect and ease of manipulation would decrease over time as markets become more liquid and mature.
Nobody fully understands the future of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but there seems to be demand for them.  Compared to other assets they are better in some ways, and worse in other ways.  That's why it's most accurate to just say bitcoin is "different."  If everyone agreed it was only worse, it would not exist as it does today.  If everyone agreed it was only better, it would be far more valuable than it currently is.  We just don't know, so the current value represents a wager on or against it's future.

Wallets (like electrum) are simply pointers to the blockchain/mempool, which is where your bitcoins and transactions actually reside.  "Resetting" electrum won't cancel the transaction.
I don't think double spending is very easy.  To get the transaction back you'll need to wait ~2 weeks until it times out of the mempool.  Then your electrum wallet will no longer recognize it as a pending transaction and you'll be permitted to create a new transaction with those coins.  Make sure you include a sufficient fee the 2nd time.

Your comment gave the impression that you are new to bitcoin, and are living in the microcosm of the last few weeks/months.  Seeing many volatile days makes you feel bitcoin is volatile, and now if we get a few stable days, you feel like maybe this is the start of real stability.
My point is this stuff have been going on for literally 8 years.  It goes through periods of growth, and periods of pullbacks.  Periods of extreme volatility, and other periods of tight stability.  It's not going to be stable anytime soon.  It has slowly been getting more stable over the years, but there is so much fluctuation in that stability.
All I am saying is that 4 days of stability is negligible when you realize bitcoin has been doing this for 2900 days.

BCH's biggest problem is something much deeper.
The crypto community simply is not satisfied with their solutions.  There is a sizeable group of traders who rallied behind it because it one can make a convincing argument for BCH, and the thought of that argument having validity and leading to a huge surge in price is very attractive.  So traders get sucked in.  We see this with the sub-community in many alt-coins as well.  People read a simple explanation for why a coin is better, and it makes sense to them.  They become convinced it will 50x in value, and that's alluring.  So now they are *true believers* in their own eyes.
The fact is that BCH was not well-received by the crypto community because most users value a more conservative approach for bitcoin's future.  People now realize the primary use-case is not to buy coffee.  It's not a better currency (yet), but it's a better asset.  As bitcoin grows in value and people are storing more value in it, the concern shifts away from 1-cent transactions, and towards taking every precaution to securing the future of the network.  Bloating the blockchain may lead to node centralization which could threaten the network and therefore value of the bitcoin asset.  The community does not want that, even if it means putting up with higher fees until a better solution is found.
The main players behind BCH were not happy with the poor reception of BCH by the community so they tried to ram it down people's throats.  In all fairness, they did perform fairly well-executed attacks on the bitcoin network by combining transactions spamming, market pressure, propaganda, and miner swapping in an attempt to rapidly destroy bitcoin (the difficulty death-spiral and what not).  It scared a lot of people and they got the reaction they wanted.  I'm not sure if they intended for it to it to actually take over, or just wanted to sell that idea to profit off the pump-and-dump.
While I was never a big proponent of what BCH was trying to do, I personally I think it's awesome that this occurred.  It is this decentralized open-source nature of crypto which is what makes it so enticing in the first place.  The cliche of "this is actually good for bitcoin" does hold true in many situations.  Being pushed to the limits, while uncomfortable, is often a good thing for individuals, business, or whatever project.  Either you come out on top stronger, or your weaknesses are exposed and you can make better decisions on how to (or not to) proceed going forward.
The problem with BCH is right there in the name.  It wants to create a *currency* above all.  Bitcoin may have started with that primary intention but most users now want it for it's functions as an asset.  The security of that asset comes before the ability to send it for pennies.

I understand what you're saying, but it's not really a *technicality*.  The expiration date is the whole point of the futures contract.  The daily settlement and practice of rolling-over contracts is a byproduct of the open market for trading existing contracts.
It's the same way bonds work.  If I buy a $1000 one-year T-bill with 3% interest, that money **IS** tied up in the contract for one year.  If after 6 months I want my money back, I don't talk to the US Treasury.  I put it up on an over-the-counter bond market.  Someone will buy it from me for ~$1015 and take over the contract.  From my perspective it may seem that I ended the contract early, but in reality that bond is still going to be completed.

It doesn't keep resending it, it's just sitting there pending.  It may end up going through in the next two weeks.  If it doesn't get picked up by a miner in that time, like I said it will (I believe) time out of the mempool.  Then your wallet will show that transaction as never having existed and back to normal.

I understand, but why would anyone gamble on the long side at 18k?
If in 30 days the price of BTC is at 17k, they will lose $1000.  The cash settlement effectively forces them to buy at 18k (the futures agreement) and sell it at market price (17k).  So CBOE deducts $1000 from their account.
If they had simply paid $16,000 today for a BTC they would have gained $1000.  In what scenario are they better off longing a 1m futures at $18k than paying $16k for a BTC today?

In an options market, he would purchase a "Put" contract, with a strike price of $9,000 and expiration in June 2018.  This gives him the option to sell at $9,000 during this period if he wishes.  It the price at the end of the contract is, say $15,000, it would be foolish to exercise his right to sell for $9,000.  The option becomes worthless.  If the price is instead $5,000 in June 2018, he will exercise his option and the other party is forced to buy his BTC at $9,000 for whatever amount the option was for.  An options contract can never have a negative value because the buyer has no obligation.  The worst case is it becomes worth $0.  Because there is no downside for the buyer of a Put, they must pay a premium (determined by market prices).
A futures contract is similar, but now the buyer is also forced to carry out the contract.  In options, only the seller has an obligation.  In futures, both seller and buyer have an obligation to settle when the contract is up.  If Joe enters a futures contract today for $9,000 with settlement date June 2018, and BTC is then at $15,000, he can't simply "pass".  He MUST complete the contract and sell for $9,000.
To my knowledge, you can't really "lock in" a baseline price while keeping potential upside using futures.  The consequences of entering a futures contract are essentially the same as simply selling BTC today, except that you are putting off the transaction for a future date.
CBOE is a futures and options market, but it's unclear to me if they will be offering options for BTC or only futures.

I would say it's more of a gradual problem to solve.  How do you go from a guy with an idea to Microsoft?  To have billions of dollars worth of assets (researchers, design, manufacturing, advertisement, distribution) you need money.  But to get that kind of money you'll need the billion dollar company generating profit.  Is it difficult to grow a company to Microsoft's levels?  Certainly.  Is it an impossible chicken-egg situation?  Apparently not.
The answer of course is investment.  You pitch the idea and raise money from people hoping it will work out in the end.  It shows promise, so now you raise 10x more money from bigger investors.  Soon you may start making small profits which you can reinvest yourself.  After years of growth and confidence that things are working, you get larger and larger outside investments, and profit reinvestment.  Eventually you have the multi-billion dollar company.  How did it happen?  Gradually.
The same idea applies to cryptocurrency adoption, only the "investment" is more of a speculative belief.  There is no company or profits, just a concept and network.  Bitcoin was more volatile in the past, and was less adopted.  Over time more people started to understand and believe in it's utility, so they took a leap and invested their belief.  In turn, adoption went up slightly and volatility down slightly.  And then more people believed in the utility and jumped in as well.
It's a gradual process and not perfectly linear, so there are ups-and-downs in price and adoption.  Sometimes general belief outpaces actual adoption/development, and is followed by pull backs.  These are the causes of the bubble cycles we have seen within the general adoption growth.

Well, the current price of bitcoin has a of speculation built in.  Basically people are betting on the bitcoin network to grow, and the protocol / related technology to keep improving.  If innovation does not keep pushing towards making bitcoin easier to use, and network growth were to stagnate, then over time the speculation will decline.
If something catastrophic were to happen, such as the SHA256 algorithm being solved, the price of bitcoin could potentially fall to 0 in a matter of days.  This is probably unlikely.  
Much more likely would be a scenario where it simply dies a slow death due to becoming irrelevant.  There are plenty of examples of legitimate technologies that ended up going this course.  A few (such as the internet) ended up taking off and becoming integrated into everyday life.  It's possible that it will never become mainstream, but also won't die and will remain for quite some time in a niche market.

I think this is because bitcoin is a thin market with a lot of friction still.  People are used to markets like the NYSE where the majority of capital can, and does, react extremely quickly to news.  Bitcoin is still relatively difficult/slow to get fiat in and out of, so the capital from new investors wanting to get in after news takes a while.  During that grace period there is more news, so it all overlaps and gets convoluted.  Hence it seems like the price never moving in a logical manner.

Bitcoin isn't immediately appealing to most people's lives right now.  If one takes time to learn about it, then the *concept* becomes appealing to many.  These people become bitcoin enthusiasts.
The supporting technology simply isn't there yet.  The core technology of bitcoin is very solid/sound.  When I say "supporting technology" I am mostly referring to two specific  things:
1. Personal wallet security and usability.  You can argue "paper wallets are so simple and foolproof!" and all that.  I sympathize, as I understand this stuff and want others too as well.  But it's undeniably complicated.  It's too easy to screw up.
2. Barriers of entry to obtaining bitcoins.  It's gotten better, but it's still not that easy to actually get bitcoins.  Especially at a good rate.  If the best one can find is a bitcoin ATM that charges 5% off the market price, that doesn't make bitcoin appealing to most.
Think of it this way.  If the goal is widespread adoption where bitcoin transactions are commonplace, then you either need people to be comfortable holding some of their wealth in the form of bitcoins (see point 1), or a cheap and easy way to get in and out of bitcoin (see point 2).

I noticed something else strange with bitstamps fees.  Their fee structure is tiered, starting at 0.5% and scaling down to 0.2% based on volume.  However if you make one large trade at the start, it hits the entire thing at 0.5%.  So if for example a person wanted to make a $500,000 trade, they would need to gradually make trades to work up to the $150,000 / 0.2% tier to avoid overpaying in fees.  This seems like lazy programming.

There are actually a few coins "priced" higher than bitcoin.  One such is worth ~$2,000 right now.  This is totally irrelevant of course, because it's not about the value of one unit but rather the value of all the units combined.  This is commonly known as the "market cap" (which many will argue isn't a true measure of a cryptocurrency's overall value, but it's a good start).
So really what you mean to ask is, "What puts bitcoin on top with its $5 billion market cap?"
Interestingly, this question was asked a lot in the early days as a concern for whether bitcoin could ever really take off.  Many argued that if bitcoin's market cap rose into the $10's and $100's of millions, ... then people would simply turn to cheaper coins rather than the pricey bitcoin.  Thus the cryptocurrency market would saturate, and none of them would ever really reach any significant value itself.
This proved to be wrong, at least to some degree as we saw the cryptocurrency market grow exponentially and bitcoin maintain a sizable lead.  As far as why this is the case, we can only theorize.  The common belief has to do with the network effect, where as a network (such as bitcoin) grows bigger, it becomes the most enticing place cryptocurrency users to flock.
(Think facebook:  Everyone is on facebook.  This makes it valuable to an individual user, because all their friends are on the site.  It has a strong network.  The strong network makes it appealing.  Since it's so appealing, everyone joins in.  Since everyone joins in, it such a strong network)
You can see it's kind of a cycle, where becoming the biggest network actually helps get more people in to make it even bigger.  This network effect has proven to be a stronger force than the other theories (people will want newer coins, cheaper coins, coins with different features).  The the value of the network effect to an individual user might not be obvious as first (why not just buy a cheaper coin?  they're all the same!), but it does in fact exist.  For one, the large network of bitcoin makes it much more secure due to all the computers simultaneously running the protocol software.  It's a big strange to think about, but all the individual users who are acting selfishly are collectively making a rock-solid network.  Secondly, bitcoin is far more recognized and accepted than any other alt-coin.  It still may not be all that useful in the real-world yet, but it's much closer than any of the "competing" cryptocurrencies.
The  spot for bitcoin simply represents that speculators have a high confidence in bitcoin's future compared to the alt-coins.  It's been around the longest, it's the biggest network, and it's by far most well known.  There's reason to believe this trend may continue.  Therefore investors as a whole are willing to pay more to gamble on bitcoin specifically rather than any alt-coins.

It's a really poor way of making your point.  The numerical value of money is arbitrary, so growth is all relative to previous values.  A better way, for example, would be to view the average growth rate of the market which has historically been about 5% a year.  Thus it doubles on average every 15 years.  So you could then argue that "ballooning" from 8500 to 17000 in only 6 years is rapid growth.  But it's much harder to say it is "extreme" as it is in your flawed example.

You make some excellent point.  Repeated exposure does get people interested in bitcoin, but your example (which is probably accurate) leads to more speculators - not more consumers transacting in bitcoins.  I would say speculators are good to some extent, helping support the price/interest/etc.  But without good things to speculate on (technological growth of the protocol and supporting projects) those people will lose interest, and stop providing value to the bitcoin project.
I would personally argue the focus is in fact weighted too heavily towards spreading it to new people, rather than improving bitcoin itself.  But this is a generalization, and doesn't matter a lot since as you said, more is better in both cases anyways.  The point of my post wasn't so much a call-to-arms for people to stop promoting and start programming.

For what it's worth I mostly agree with your thoughts.  However I think this type of growth analysis can be said of most upcoming ventures who are trying to capture market share in some industry.  The vast majority never succeed in doing so.  I think it's easy to get caught up in the possibility of bitcoin getting as large as you described, and start to believe it's a likely outcome.  There are just a lot of roadblocks, and the concepts of bitcoins as a mass-adopted technology are still just a theory.  All we have right now is a small experiment which many are speculating on, driving the price up.

Interesting anecdote for me about this.  I (american) was in Europe last month and used Airbnb a few times.  Long story short, one of the Airbnb hosts owed me a ~$300 refund but there's no good way for him to send me the money.  Wire-fees and exchange rates would chew up something like half the amount.  We ended up having him buy me an amazon gift card to settle it, but before arriving on that I suggested (as a shot in the dark) that he send me bitcoins.  He of course had never heard of it, but it would be a cool "bitcoin is real" moment for me if Airbnb actually started accepting them.

I do agree it will help get consumers "involved," but what does that amount to much beyond them thinking "what is bitcoin?" or "that's cool I remember reading about bitcoin."
Perhaps 1-2 years ago this would have had a big impact, but at this point most people have already heard of btc and a majority end up dismissing it.  And rightfully so unless they are interested in speculative investing or have very specific transaction needs.  Rather than hoping these people will give it another look, the focus should be on making bitcoin itself better.

No, it is not guaranteed to make it to the address.  Your wallet *should* show the btc as pending rather than gone.  Technically the coins still reside in your wallet until a miner includes your transaction in a new block.  
If your transaction fee is too small, the miners will repeatedly skip your transaction in favor of ones with larger fees.  This means your bitcoins continue to reside in your own wallet.  They never actually left, so while it may seem they are "lost in transmission", they still belong to you.
At this point you can send a completely new transaction from the same address with a sufficiently large fee.  The miners will decide to include this new transaction as a result.  The original transaction will never get included in the blockchain once the new transaction is accepted.

I think it has a lot of similarities.  It is actually surprising to see how closely the 2013 bubble and 2017 bubble repeated themselves.  Logically one would expect the "market" to learn from the past, but the market is made up of individuals making very emotional decisions.  If you look at the behaviors of close friends/family/yourself (in general life things like relationships etc), you can see humans repeat the same emotional cycles over and over again before learning from them, if ever.
I will note one difference: During the 2014 crash and bottoming-out, there was a distinct expectation that it might NEVER recover and would fall under $100, $50, so on.  There was the prediction it would fall under $10 within a year.  In this bear market, most of the discussion is over "Will the bottom be at $3000 or $1500?".  Back then the discussion was more "Is a bottom coming soon or is it headed to $0"?
It may seem counter-intuitive, but the fact there is still this general optimism in the market makes me think we may have not reached the bottom yet (assuming it does in fact reach new ATHs again someday).  If emotional participants are still holding out hope, it means there's still room for bulls to turn bear and force selling pressure.  Once the vast majority of emotions have turned bearish - is when the market bottoms out and surprises everyone.  This is the nature of market cycles.

Ah okay.  So the protocol forces your "random" inputs to start with some characters related to the present situation (previous block and current transactions).  Then you add random guesses and hope the combined string turns into a winning hash.
But as soon as the prefixes change, your winning hash becomes garbage.  When combined with the original prefixes they were a winner, but combined with the new ones they don't produce leading zeros.
Am I also correct about additional precision beyond the number of leading zeros?  Do you happen to know how far down it goes?  Like if the requirement is 16 leading zeros, how many more characters of precision is there to get a precise difficulty?

As others mentioned, the fact that the Bcash fork didn't seem to mess things up is seen as a positive.  Keep in mind that this fork was on the heels of a long-overdue segwit implementation.  BTC's price has probably been suppressed over the past year.  That statement might sound counter intuitive because BTC's price has been rising, but BTC had been losing market share all year.  If the fiat inflow had gone to BTC we would have already seen a $5000+ price.
Now BTC has regained a bit of market share, while the entire market has become a bit more robust and grown as a whole.

I wouldn't say it's worthless.  However for the most part it's very difficult to ascertain which coins are lost vs held, or even as a % of the supply.  So due to the complexity I think most attempts to quantify it are feeble.
In my opinion, the only coins worth tracking are probably satoshi's.  Simply due to the sheer number and very uncertain status.  I'm not sure how it would be possible to confirm they are lost, but if he moved or signed those early coins it would be a huge deal.

I don't think you're going to have a very enjoyable first few months of bitcoin holding.  It's probably pretty unlikely to just "recover" from here.  I can't blame you for wanting to get in finally, and waiting until now rather than panic-buying at $1000+ was reasonable.
But there is a lot of uncertainty and fear in the bitcoin market right now.  I don't doubt that your purchase may yield a positive return eventually, but it may be years.  And there's no chance it just sticks at 750 for many months before finally climbing back up.  It will be volatile and quite likely we will see significantly lower prices than this.

Your decision seems responsible so there's no real worry.
I followed it fairly closely since early 2011 as well, never buying.  When it started rising in 2013 to $400+, I realized I wanted to eventually get a position.  I tried so hard to resist buying during the mania phase, dreaming of a crash back to below 200 so I could get a much better entry.  But I caved.  I bought during the run-up, at the peak, and some on the way down.  I had the same mindset that it didn't matter if I paid too much, because long-term it would likely be worth more.
The truth is that it ended up sucking a lot more than I expected.  When it came down to the 200's for stretches of months/years, it's hard to ignore the fact that I'd lost 70%+ of the value I had paid.  Even if it eventually recovered, I could have had 3x the amount if I had simply been patient and waited for the hype to die out.
It was super frustrating seeing the price fall to 200 exactly as I'd hoped before.  Yet I had bought a lot during the 2013 mania and could only justify buying a bit more at the low levels.  Even now that it's risen quite a lot since then, and I'm somewhat in the positive, it's hard to ignore how costly it was to time my initial buys so poorly.

Well, many were hoping for a recovery back to 1k+ when it was in the low 900s.  The price has thus far failed to recover from that overall crash.  Then the isolated China crackdown incident took the price from 920 to 755, and it's only gained back about 40% of that.  If the China news were a wash, we'd at least be back in the 900s.  And if we were seeing an actual recovery from the ATH, we should be pushing 1k by now.

Of course the long-term holders have, and likely will continue to kill it.  But is 830 really the bottom?
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:24:01
The scarcity only affects (verb, use "a") the value in one of three cases:
1. There is less selling pressure as a result of fewer sellers.  In the holding argument, it's the same assuming the holder isn't changing his decisions in some way.  Presumably any holder will eventually sell, which will eventually put selling pressure on the market.  A good example is satoshi's early coins.  We don't know whether they are being held or lost.  Clearly either is possible in the present state, which shows that the impact of held vs lost coins is the same.  That is, until the holder decides to stop holding.  If satoshi started selling those coins then price would fall to some extent.
2. When the increase in scarcity is public knowledge.  We can be confident that some number of coins are lost, and perhaps this slightly influences people's buying/selling decisions.  In your Picasso example, say all but 1 of the 21 paintings are destroyed.  If those 20 destroyed paintings were in private collections who never intended to sell them, don't intend to replace them - AND they told no one about the loss - then there would be no impact on the price of the final painting.  Collectors would bid on the final painting under the assumption that there are 20 others.  Those 20 paintings provided no liquidity to the market presently anyways, so their existence only affected the market price in a speculative way (I better not overly speculate and overpay for this 1 available Picasso because who knows when some of the other 20 Picassos might flood the market and depress the price).
3. People who accidentally destroy their coins change their behavior.  If I have 1 BTC and lose it, I might decide to buy another BTC to replace it.  If the loss directly impacts my buying decisions, that puts additional buying pressure on the market and this pushes the price up slightly.  It's also possible that someone owns 100 BTC and accidentally destroys 1.  They become frustrated and anxious about their remaining 99 BTC and decide to dump them for dollars.  So this effect could impact price in either direction.
Basically, neither destroyed nor held coins are active in the market.  So there is no direct difference between their effect (noun, use "e") on the price.  Only when a change in their status occurs publicly does it impact the price.  Held coins being sold, or destroyed coins being somehow proven as destroyed (or coins previous assumed to be destroyed being moved).  Or if it influences the decision of the owner of the destroyed coins.

Yes, if the price inexplicably drops from 3700 to 47 overnight, it's easy to see a buying opportunity.
Imagine instead it gets beaten down from 3700 to 2500 to 2000 to 1800 to 1500 to 1150 to 950 to 700 to 550 to 400 to 225 to 140 to 110 to 85 to 60 to 47 over the course of two years.

Most don't consider ~2% to be hyperinflation.  And I'd agree it's debatable if 2% is better than 0%.  Both are probably okay.  The government goes with 2% because it gives them extra maneuverability.  This inflation doesn't destroy the citizens because they can easily convert that fiat into assets like stocks, bonds, and homes.
Fiat currency is about more than just modest inflation.  It's a reliable way to store value (somewhat temporarily) and facilitate exchanges of goods and services, and is backed by a the government, military, police, and economy built by tens or hundreds of millions of citizens.  No it's not perfect but neither is bitcoin.  And neither is likely disappearing anytime soon.

You have to try to obtain a bit of perspective.
Crypto has been around for 9 years now and has done quite a lot.  Like anything controversial that starts to get big, it will not be perfect in any individual's eyes.  To be losing confidence entirely in it seems like an emotional or poorly thought out stance.
The truth is, you are losing confidence in yourself as a trader.  I know this sucks, but it's a natural progression.  People just like you and OP go through this process \- along with the masses \- at the same time and it forms the market cycles we see on charts.  I know what it's like, I went through the exact same thing as you in 2014.
It sucks to make bad trades.  It sucks to get pulled into fomo even when you know it's happening.  You probably didn't plan to replace your bank account with crypto when you first bought any more than you don't plan on it today.  You bought simply because you hoped it would go higher, period.  You are disappointed in crypto because the price and hype died down on you.
Take some time to actually research and form substantial opinions on your own.  Whatever trading mistakes you have already made can't be changed, they're in the past.  If you don't like it, then don't get involved.  But whatever you do, don't decide in a few years to again buy the next peak because you're once again "confident" in crypto because the growth is again so strong.
Either decide to research and be a smart investor, or invest elsewhere.

The analogy to this would be tracing your transaction to the origin.  I'll try to explain to answer your question:
Right now, a mining reward is 1,250,000,000 sat(oshi).  That amount goes to Address M.  Address M can broadcast a transaction with outputs of:
1,149,900,000 sat to Change
100,000,000 sat to Lunatic
100,000 sat to next block (mining fees)
The network accepts this as a valid TX because the starting balance equals the sum of the outputs.  You, Lunatic, received 100m sat from Address M.  That equals 1 BTC.  The history, or "origin tracing" is made up of only the above transaction.  It's very simple.  One could argue, it's very crisp the way a 50 dollar bill is crisp.  I can't say you are wrong, it's just a matter of opinion.  Any copy of the blockchain will just as easily verify a more complicated "history" than this simple one.  So is one better than the other?  It really depends on your perspective.  
Some would say a crisp 50 dollar bill is better.  It looks nice and is simple.  Others might say fifty $1 bills are better.  They are versatile, more easily divisible.  You can buy soda with them.  Really depends on your goals.  Yet, bottom line, they are both worth basically the exact same.  
The same situation applies here.  Since bitcoins are simply addresses (and corresponding private keys) with a ledger history, then yes some bitcoins have a cleaner history.  You could interpret them as coming from a less complicated source.  All satoshis are individual units to begin with, so even virgin mined bitcoins are still technically "shit ton of little shards" just as much as bitcoins with a complex blockchain transaction history.  But still, as I said before, you can differentiate in the complexity of an address' history.  Some people, like you, might enjoy the novelty of a clean, simple history.  Just like some people want a crisp $50.  Yet all bitcoin wallets can immediately verify even the most complex chain of transactions to verify the contents of an address.  Just like anyone will accept a stack of fifty old $1 bills as well.  It's all worth the same.  Some might actually prefer the complex history of a bitcoin address for more separation from the source.  Who knows.  
Bottom line, yes you could *kind of* control that.  You'd have to specify the source and demand to be sent from a source with very little separation from the mining block source.  It's quite pedantic to care about though, because it's trying to force a previous concept (the crisp and whole-ness of a single large bill) into a new situation where it no longer has relevance or meaning.

That doesn't necessarily make it safer.
Say you expect to save $10,000 a year from your job after taxes/expenses.  If you take out a loan for $10,000 and buy btc with it, you'll be able to pay off your debt after 1 year regardless of the price of btc.  Your net worth is at worst $0.
Now say you instead take out a loan of $300,000 to buy a house.  If the value of the house only drops to $250,000 over the course of the year, you would owe $290,000 ignoring interest.  Net worth of -$40,000.
Because houses are considered safer investments, people get way more aggressive in borrowing to buy them.  As such, small fluctuations can lead to big problems when they were expecting stability or even growth in value.
Before the housing bubble, people were buying houses with payments they couldn't afford to make over time, with the expectation that the value would simply rise soon so they could refinance

This is a bad idea for the same reason your idea is a bad idea.  You are ignoring other outcomes.  Such as the roulette bet coming up black.  Or in bitcoin's case, you move your life savings in at $7000 and things plummet and you sadly sell it in a year at $1000.  Your bullish feeling is not a time machine, you do not know the future.  Yes this can very realistically happen.  In fact, similar things have happened to bitcoin in the past.  
Any money you put into bitcoin you should consider gone.  If you are okay with obliterating your life savings and having nothing, and needing to rebuild from zero, then fine.  Go ahead and do it.

The price of a coin makes no difference.  Does it change your argument when you realize he actually bought up seg2x coins at a price of $0.00001 per satoshi?
I'm not making a case for why I believe seg2x futures were a good investment.  I didn't buy any and in fact was leaning more towards shorting them (if anything).  I'm simply pointing out that investing in something before it is guaranteed to exist is not always a fools errand.
You (and others) in this thread held an opinion, namely that segwit2x was a bad investment.  It unfolded that your opinion turned out correct.

Yeah.  What people don't realize when they look back at charts and see dips, is people were scared at the bottom of dips.  A dip, by definition, is caused by accelerated selling.  Why would someone sell something at $400 when a week ago they could have gotten $500?  The answer, of course, is fear.  People think they are separated from the market, but that literally is what the market is.  People just like you and me and hopeful dip-buyers.  Dips only materialize because actual, real people who previously weren't scared, become scared.  And odds are, many of these same people proclaiming to be waiting for a dip will also become scared.

I don't think your point is bad at all, that it's more important long-term to focus on development and such.  But if you are commenting on your position/gains as you did here and in the OP, then you also care about the price.  You even say in your video how you are happy and smug about it going up and being correct.
Even if you hold no bitcoin and simply hope it succeeds, price increase should still be looked at as a positive.  The biggest hurdle is to get more people in the world comfortable using bitcoin, and owning some for themselves - basically distributing it among the population.  As the price goes up, early adopters are incentivized to sell or spend some of their holdings to newcomers.  It also has the effect of actually drawing in those newcomers into the system.  Sure this is driven by speculation/greed which leads to bubbles, but that's still a part of the growth cycle.
Whether you think price drives adoption, or adoption drives price - there is no denying that they are correlated.  It's not a perfect measure of bitcoin's success, but it means something to almost all participants and observers of bitcoin.  Thus, people celebrate.  There's no need to get agitated.  Not everyone is interested in developing software or running nodes, some people are just akin to sports fans.  It's a public forum so you get a lot of that here.

I mean, I don't know what to tell you.  Watch "The Big Short", as it's a perfect example.  The guys were literally laughed at for wanting to short credit-default-swaps.  It was like giving away free money, because these things **had never failed**.  The highest-up in finance *knew* those things were as good as gold.  Week after week, month after month the mortgaged-backed swaps made bankers money.
Then the whole thing imploded way beyond levels thought remotely possible.
The point of my analogy is simple: Just because similar things behave one way in the past, is no guarantee on future behavior.


You cannot know this.  What if several key exchanges and mining groups got together an unanimously joined to exclusively support 2x.  Futures rocket, everyone wants a piece.  Onlookers have doubts about what is the real bitcoin.  It's almost a toss-up and they both BTC and B2X trade at $3500 each after the fork.  Maybe 2x takes over and are soon at $6000.
I'm scratching my head trying to figure out what thought bubble you feel I'm stuck in.  I don't think the above scenario was likely enough to warrant betting on 2x.  I think shorting was the play.  But I don't think the strategy was garbage or that this trader has mental issues.  He simply believed more in segwit2x.  All I'm saying is markets are unpredictable and they are constantly shattering the limits of what seems probable/possible.  Crypto has done this time and time again.
This debate boils down to my opinion that "very surprising and unexpected results may occur".  You are of the opinion that "no, there are clearly defined bounds of what's possible, and I know they will never be broken".  I think that logic is dangerous, especially when referencing past events as evidence.  If you feel I'm wrong (which you clearly do), then act according to your beliefs.  I hope those assumptions make you successful trades and you don't get burned for them someday.  Good luck.

@_date: 2017-11-10 21:32:12
Like I mentioned, I only am making that analogy to the extent that something unexpected happened.
If you wait until a trend has taken hold, you're probably not going to get in anywhere near the ground-floor price.  I understand that you are of the opinion that it was a hopeless bet that between his purchase date and segwit2x actually launching, for S2X tokens to trade above $1000.  With that assumption, of course it would be foolish to buy them at $1000.  Might as well wait for them to launch and get them under $1000, as you say.  However I don't agree with your assumption.  I think if certain events had played out differently, futures could have risen above $1000 in the days leading up to fork, and at fork time been trading at $1500, $2000, etc.
Again, I personally think it was a bad bet, I've stated that.  I think the odds were too low.  But I think they were well above 0%.  I also feel your evidence of prior forks is very insufficient to provide the level of confidence you are expressing (effectively 0%).  
I also believe it's possible that we were wrong, and this was actually a good bet despite the outcome.  Perhaps this had a 70% chance of succeeding and unfortunately for the guy, it landed on the 30% where segwit2x failed.  We have no way of knowing.  That doesn't stop me from trying to analyze situations and draw my own conclusions.  But it does prevent me from claiming I know things for certain, when that level of confidence is likely unattainable.

If things had turned out differently and 2x took over, you would be saying "What a visionary.  How did he know?  I wish I had been that smart."

It's not a "wouldn't be surprised" situation, it's 100% certain this is the reason.  This happens anytime there is friction on the fiat end of an exchange.  Fiat currently can't get out, while crypto can.  This creates demand for crypto within finex ecosystem.  High demand means high crypto prices.

I agree.  While I'm mostly just an observer (don't have a full node or anything), I would say I don't support all these forks either.  I was just pointing out why "they" didn't necessarily get a blocksize increase yet.  Most people support segwit, so many of "them" are unsatisfied with a blocksize increase which also rejects segwit.  Thus they want segwit2x.

Sure you can nitpick and say nothing is 100%, like to say you aren't 100% sure an object will fall due to gravity this time if you release it.
I personally have USD on finex which I would like to take off.  However the price is inflated so I'd be paying a 5% premium to trade it to crypto and withdraw.  If there were no friction, I would simply cashout the USD, buy bitcoins on stamp, deposit to finex and sell for a 5% profit.
Arbitrage is what keeps markets aligned.  Friction makes arbitrage difficult/impossible.  There is no friction at bitstamp.  There is friction at finex.  If you are having doubts about what's causing the gap between finex/stamp, then you lack clear understanding of markets.
I don't mean to be abrasive or rude, but unlike many speculative opinions in the cyrpto world, this is quite clear-cut.

You don't need any special software, just an understanding of how change addresses work.
When you send from address A to address B, you actually empty A and send to B and C.  For example if your address initially had 1 BTC and you sent 0.3, then the full transaction is 0.3 to B and 0.7 to C.  Address C is in your control, your wallet handles it.  In order to force the transaction through, you make a transaction from C to D(also in your control) with a sufficiently large fee.  You basically need a double-fee to get it accepted, because the miners must include TWO transactions so they want sufficient incentive to do so.  Miners will see the new large fee, and will be required to process the first transaction (in which C received the BTC) in order for the second transaction (in which C sent out those BTC) to be valid.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:13:03
Interesting.  I have been of the viewpoint that it was simply SEGWIT which moved it so fast.  Segwit (in my view) was a very clear software upgrade which helps minimize the info needed per transaction, as well as fixed a malleability flaw.  Such a simple upgrade should have been pushed long ago, but hijacking from Bitmain prevented it.  The community finally overcame that.  It showed resilience from control and improved the network.
I didn't (and still kind of don't) think segwit2x was important.  Obviously some type of scaling solution is needed at some point, whether its bigger blocks or lightning network or something else.  Getting segwit was a much bigger deal than whether segwit2x happens or not, imo.

The BOB (board of bitcoin) consists of 13 members, who each take rotating 8 hour shifts in the MMR (market maker room).  There are always exactly 4 members actively price-setting at any given time.  Three of the members are tasked with PDS (price direction setting) while one is tasked with PMS (price magnitude setting).  Each PDS member choses the price either up, down, or flat every 3 seconds.  They are constantly rotating so their determination is a movement with respect to the previous PDS member's choice.  This causes a price movement (potentially, unless "flat" is chosen) every 1 second.
Meanwhile the PMS has a slider-style method which affects the magnitude of the price movements.  If he ramps down the slider, then all movements are mild so price stays pretty steady.  If he ramps up the volatility slider, then all price movements are magnified and this is when we see large crashes or upward spikes.
By this method no one actor is able to influence the price on his own with this check and balance price setting method by the BOB.

Ok look.  The news obviously "matters" in that price reacts to it.  But when markets are bull, then bad news doesn't have much impact (maybe a small down which quickly corrects back up, so it overall seems to not matter).  Whereas good news skyrockets the price and it never looks back so it clearly appears to matter.
In a bear market, the reverse is true.  Good news seems to help temporarily but then it goes back down and appears to really not matter.  And bad news drops the price and it doesn't recover.  So it seems only the bad news matters.
The truth is that the market is just doing it's thing irrelevant to the news.  Right now the market's thing is to correct back a lot of the massive 2017 gains and especially the parabolic rise in nov/dec.  That's the reason it's going down.  The news doesn't impact this.  It may cause small blips in exactly how/when it makes this downward correction, but the downward correction is happening regardless.
China didn't "matter" because it was a bull market.  Now india "matters" because it's a bear market.

Yes, this is one way to look at it.  Some people will still sell bad news in a bull market anyways, but it finds support from other buyers who don't see the news as so important in a bull market.  There is usually at least a flinch in the price but aggressive buying afterwards often brings the price back up to pre-news levels and beyond.  This gives even more confidence to the market that it can overcome even bad news, and FOMO kicks in because "no real dip is coming if bad news can't even drive it down".
There are a few ways to look at it and can depend on the specific bullishness or bearishness of the market and the specific impact of the news.  But bottom line is that news does not drive the direction of the market whatsoever.  Even when it appears one piece of news causes a sentiment change, it was very likely on the brink of changing anyways.  The news might have just started it a day earlier.

That wasn't my intention.  I was just curious if he was actively allocating his BTC to other things or just holding BTC passively.

Ah yeah I see what you're saying.  With the way the site (and most casinos) structure the edge, the goal should be to minimize the amount wagered.  What this guy did was wager a ton, so it was terrible (although someone pointed out he didn't have much choice as they cap the max payout at 270 btc or so).
If you start with 1 btc, you could bet 0.5 with a 3x payout at 0.33.  If that loses, bet the remaining 0.5 with a 4x payout at 0.2475.  The odds of losing both bets are 50.42%, so odds of doubling are 49.58%, slightly higher.
You confused me because typically people talk about martingale as a low-risk way to win a small amount, and they repeat the pattern many times.  But yeah the most effective way is to bet as aggressively as possible.  Basically betting at 99x payout at 1% with the appropriate bet amount so if you ever win, you end up at 2 BTC.  I would guess the success % would trend towards 49.75
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:55:13
The worst part is the method he used to gamble.  Let me explain:
He started with 1767.5 btc, and after 26 rolls he had a balance of 7022 btc.  Seems good until you realize that the odds of winning those 26 rolls was 18.65% (given the chance %s he set).
A fair payout for a 1767.5 btc wager at 18.65% would be 9475.2 btc.  Since the site takes a %, my guess is the actual payout would have been around 9400 btc.
So if he just set the chance at 18.65% and wagered it all once and won, he'd have 9400 btc.  Instead he made a series of bets with 18.65% chance of them all winning, and ended up with 7016 btc.
The lesson is, if you are going to gamble, do it aggressively and quit.  The worst thing you can do is grind out lots of bets like this.  Unless you are purely looking for entertainment from each bet.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:06:38
Actually no, that was kind of my point.  Using a martingale sequence will give you under 49.5% chance of doubling your balance.  Not over.
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:28:08
Correct, the distinction lies in whether the odds are in your favor or against you.  I should have clarified that when I say "gamble", I meant as in casino games or games like this that have a negative expectation.
The optimal bet amount for this dice game is 0%.  I was just pointing out that if he felt the need to 5x his bitcoins, he could have done so with far better odds if he hadn't drawn it out like this.

All the bets are bad in this dice game and there are no strategies that are remotely "good".  It's just interesting that many people will go to a casino with, say, $100 and plan to either get to $200 and quit, or to $0.  But they will start by betting $5 and seeing what happens.  By the end they might have actually bet like $1000 because you are constantly "reinvesting" your previous wins.  If the game has a 3% house-edge, you essentially gave the casino $30.  If instead you just bet $100 once (to $200 or $0), you would only be giving the casino $3.
The point is just that if you are going to play a losing game with some end-goal in mind, you are better off making one very risk bet to attempt to get there.  You are actually more likely to succeed when compared to the "low-risk" drawn-out method this guy uses.  So somewhat counter-intuitively, the drawn-out method actually fares worse and as such could be considered higher risk.

One thing that is for sure is that whatever the lowest price it gets to, people will be very convinced it's going a lot lower in that moment.  The same people who today say the bottom is ___ will definitely no longer be certain the bottom is ___ as the prices crashes rapidly towards ___.  The bottom is always unfathomably lower than it felt it could go a day prior to the bottom.

It's not really equations, per se, but rather algorithms.  Specifically the SHA-256 algorithm which was designed by the NSA for national security.  It is open-source so they don't control it, and many internet things use this encryption algorithm.
Think of SHA-256 as a series of transformations machines.  Each machine takes an input string (letters and numbers), performs a pre-set transformation on it, and spits out an output.  Then the next machine does it's own transformation.  After several dozen rounds of this, you end up with the "hash".
Miners are trying to put in random strings and output a hash within a very small, specific range.  They try a guess, see if it falls in the range, if not they guess again.  Repeat billions and billions of times.  If it's in the range the miner, the miner broadcasts his "win", it gets verified and he gets a rewards of (currently) 12.5 BTC.  The mining serves no real purpose other than being extremely computer-intensive, which provides security to the network.

The numbers are exactly the same.  Which is fine, but I think OP is clearly intending to mislead from this fact.
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:22:30
There are around 2 to 2.5 btc worth of fees in each block right now on top of the 12.5 reward.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:09:48
No.  The problem is that currently only ~2000 transactions can be verified every block.  There is an equalizing mechanism such that blocks are found every ~10 minutes.  More miners won't affect either of these numbers in the long-run, so it is not a solution in any way.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:53:50
One block is earning about 15 BTC with reward and fees.  Market price is around $23,700 for those BTC.  The most efficient miners will be able to mine at a cost of slightly below that, on average, enabling them to earn a small profit.  For the vast majority, the cost of their mining rigs plus electricity costs will be far more than the value of the bitcoins.  Hence, most people shouldn't mine.

@_date: 2017-05-07 15:02:44
Of course you felt less confident at $160, so did everyone else.  That's why the price shed 85%.  Now it's at an ATH, so you feel confident and assume it will hit $16,000 soon.  But that's also why it will probably take a while.

It depends how long down the road it is, and where bitcoin has progressed to by then.
If a financial meltdown were to occur tomorrow, bitcoin would likely get wrecked.  Right now the bitcoin price is essentially speculation on a new form of wealth storage.  When markets plummet, people RUN from speculation.  Bitcoin is speculation.  Bitcoin would get wrecked in the short-term.

Here's a question I think I know the answer to, but would like confirmation (plus might help someone else:
When I initially set up electrum, it provides me with 5 receiving addresses.  As I start to use it, it provides me with more fresh addresses to the point I now have ~20 addresses.
Let's say my drive fails.  When I go to recover using my seed, will it only show the first 5 addresses to start?  Or can I tell it to generate me 30 addresses so I have access to all my pairs which hold coins?

Why? He still followed the course.  He just went through a hazard.  I imagine you can't get much traction on grass so is much slower and slippery.  The concrete isn't the required path, it's just the best path, so everyone stays on it despite the curves.  Basically there is no rule needed to require riders to prevent this, because it is naturally disadvantageous.
