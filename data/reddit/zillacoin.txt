Go Britain! get out of the EU!
Like Switzerland and Norway,  they are doing really bad without the EU stranglehold... 
Trade has no borders, just like Bitcoin.

If you want to know the future  Look at history (Winston Churchill) 
Crypto is in it's infancy, loads of coins and new players. Compare this to the automobile industry 100 years ago and to the PC industry 30 years ago.
100 years ago a person had to walk in front of a car waving a red flag because these machines from hell were a threat. 
A couple a decades later we had literally thousands of car manufacturers , the fittest survived. 
Same thing happened to the hard- and software manufacturers from the 80's, remember WordPerfect, Corel Draw and Harvard Graphics as the "big"  software players?  
Anyone seen any SGI/WANG/TANDY/ATARI hardware lately?
I Think the same thing will happen to crypto, the market will sort things out and the fittest will survive.
