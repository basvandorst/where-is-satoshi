Collect yourself and make a decision  
1) HODL  
2) Sell now  
3) Sell soon  
4) Completely ignore the price   
Throwing up won't help you. Nor will panicking. Choose one.

It will be launched for like 4-5 states first (including CA). Do you guys think WA will ever adopt it due to the strict state laws?

Also got out in December. Haven't been hodling for years like a lot of you guys. I couldn't handle the nights not knowing what the price would be when I woke up. Though I made good money, the fun began when the torment ended.

If you can't afford to lose it... why do you have Bitcoin?

I guess I should expect to see this photo all week.

If you can't afford to lose it, you shouldn't be here.

Why are people sad that bitcoin is dropping? You can buy more!  If you are sad because you need to make money FAST because you bought bitcoin on borrowed money, SHAME ON YOU.

There is so much to bitcoin, I would be foolish to pretend I know everything about it. To simply things, I just say I'm here for the lambos.  Though I currently no longer have any bitcoin.

Bought at 5k. Sold on Dec12th at about 17k remembering what my grandfather used to tell me.. "when your barber tells you to buy [equities], it’s time to sell". Too many people were talking about it then so I decided I was done.  
For those hodling, I guess they either really believe in the currency or just refuse to lose money.

This is fine.

Why is everyone so confident in what they think is going to happen?  WE DONT KNOW.  ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:49:21
Are you confident that some people know???

Not too much blood right now.  It's just a flesh wound.

Bitcoin will go lower. Might rebuy if it dips under 5k
