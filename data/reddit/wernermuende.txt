You know, a while ago I would have said that wouldn't faze anyone, since we all hodl'd through the big crash of 2013 but the massive influx of of people who weren't around back then makes me think the discussions would be quite interesting.

Some things make much more sense if you remember that about half the people have a below average IQ and that even smart people can make stupid decisions

The thing about division of labor is that even educated people's area of expertise is very narrow, so competence in one field does not necessarily correlate with competence in another field.

I'm not really familiar with how it's done, but afaik the test is designed in a way that the average is 100 by definition
70 Percent of people are within one standard deviation from the middle, half under and half over the average, no?

The... "beauty" of social media is that *anyone* can participate. 
Hanlon's Razor is more important in social media than in other domains of human interaction.

Well, the krauts and frogs stand with the taigs so the tans should use the time to stock up on some sweet single market kerrygold to butter their butts with if they get fucked by tariffs. 
I'd even be prepared to drink Jameson to prop up the irish economy.
Still, I'd much prefer me some single market Laphroaigh because we still love the brits, even if they're a bit daft

I guess having lots of millionaires isn't such a good thing after all for a country

A thousand souls of the weak-handed are sacrificed to the God-Emperor every day, to keep the light shining that is the Blockchain, keeping humanity from total anhiliation at the hand of the false fiat gods

Well, the *transfer* so to speak should not happen as a simple copy. 
You add artificial capacity to the brain. Like external storage to your computer. Then you begin using the extension as part of your brain, slowly building functions in parallel. As one single system, maybe with a bit of transient redundancy. Then fading out the bio parts. Voila. Continuity.

Well, I always think that for the uploaded entity to be "you", you need to have continuity. So a time of the wetware and the hardware running in parallel, connected to each other, then gradually shifting functions to just the hardware. 
The main "problem" is that you would be able to run multiple instances of uploaded consciousnesses. Talking to yourself will be a totally different experience...

If I may sum up my experience with bitcoin in one sentence:
*Don't be surprised.*

I would still buy Sithcoin, though. 
The sith rule of the apprentice killing the master basically means it's also 100% no-fork

As a german, this typo confused the fuck out of me

I just had a month premium for the VR content when I got my Oculus Rift, you know, for science. 
I did a little showing off get together where I demoed some of the ... possibilities to my friends.

Germans do not half-ass shit. Spoken language is one thing, but words put in writing warrant some level of care.
OP made a mistake, the german thing would be to correct the mistake so OP can learn for the future.
Although you are correct. That comment is impolite, unhelpful and, frankly, retarded. Or an attempt at humor that is incompatible with my german brain. Posts do not get ruined by bad spelling.

I think just the fact that you can buy a pornhub premium membership with Bitcoin should raise your confidence immensely.

The euro-crisis was and is just a sub-crisis of the global crisis of finance. 
The idea that leaving the EU will protect the UK from a failing Euro (which it isn't even a part of) is ... interesting, to say the least.
Globalisation is a bitch
