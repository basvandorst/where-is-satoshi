coinbase! easyest and the one that most people use when they start with bitcoin. Everyones gunna send you a link to their refferral page I bet seeing this, but im first! lol. ill DM it to you. we will both get 10$ of bitcoin for free :) I signed one buddy up awhile ago and that 10$ is now worth 30 haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:01:25
But if you started yesterday he would buy in at 11k or whatever rather than say 2010. Maybe its meant not to take it too literally and it just means the past rather than YESTERDAY specifically? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:27:45
But don’t the bitcoins promised in a futures contract be granted later in time?? I️ don’t know that much about futures 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:18:05
which is when I panic sold my bitcoin. Ive just bought back in at 17500 so I now have HALF the amount I had just less than two weeks ago. thanks for the reminder haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:32:16
oh come on with this shit. you have no idea. clearly. stop.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:55:02
Yea it’s easy to say stuff like that st an all time high. If it crashes to 8k he will have made a good decision
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:13:51


yea i looking at that too.. did some googing and it seems like a sign its gunna go down?
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:30:02
The price went higher 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:24:07
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:03:34
20k by March!
Also... Bitcoin went up almost 2.45% in the past 24 hours. does that even things out?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:24:51
i break arm for 200 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-22 07:03:19
You’re right and I’ll upvote you. I have no desire to argue on the internet. I also don’t care who the guy is. I’m just making an observation on how he sounds like a dude that does not do very well with women. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:43:03
right? i mean this seems so obvious to me but i want to hear if there are arguments otherwise
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:28:54
Dude I️ hate not having my coins right now... have held since 2600 and panic sell at 9k. I️ even have a leger in the mail arriving soon :( waiting patiently for a dip
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:51:17
Why not send him bitcoin somehow. Does he not have a way to accept bitcoin somehow? If so that seems inane to me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:47:46
I sold when it was around 11 but then fucking dipped to 9k for a total of five seconds then went back to 11 and gdax crashed.. I cant believe it dude it crashed and fucked me. Is this thing ever going to go back down?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:47:57
Because probably scared the price will go up just like anyone else 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:57:46
If theyre doing such a great job why is bitcoin such a joke right now as far as a currency? 30 dollar fees that take forever.. Its a joke. Maybe i let myself get brainwashed a bit over at btc and I love myself a good conspiracy, but it all just makes too much sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:19:38
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:49:54
this is seriously my ideal scenario
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:57:16

But how are they buying and making long positions  with bitcoin it’s like buying bitcoin with bitcoin , no?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:36:04
dude ALWAYS trust internet strangers over your true friends.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:35:02
dude I have like 1000 bitcoin in my trezor under my mattress!! (im kidding. i wish)
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:08:57
im just kidding and making fun of all the kids
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:38:36
I have a time machine so I went back to 2010 and went all in on bitcoin. Needless to say I have more money than I know what to do with, and I have just been having sex with a disgusting amount of prostitutes and I can buy limitless cocaine for them and our little parties. Sometimes I will have them invite their whole gang of prostitute friends over and we will have a giant cuddle puddle cocaine orgy for days on end. Compare that to USD where I once got duped into having to pay more for a prostitute than I had planned (she had me all riled up and I couldn't just say "no, just the handjob with boobs inside of shirt is good" I had to see those boobs and go for at least a blow job. Ill spare you the details of the hooking up (I hate when people include useless details in a story) but we went the whole four bases which ended up costing me 20$ more than I had on me. So I had to go to the ATM that she told me was "just down the street." I should have been suspicious right there that she knew the ATM was there. I get there, put in my debit card, and this dude comes out of nowhere (that the prostitute was clearly in on this with) with a gun pointed at my face and tells me to "shut the fuck up and call your bank and tell them to increase your withdrawal limit to 1000 USD." So I call the bank in fear of my life, and they agree. The guy takes my 1000 USD and runs off with it. Gone. 
I think its pretty clear from this example how much better bitcoin is compared to USD.
Ok on a seirous note though, bitcoin REALLY is the future especially because in less than two years from now, not only will the US Federal Reserve, banks, and government collapse as a result, the entire worldwide financial ecosystem completely be torn apart from the inside. Oh and also once the war starts (between the Bitcoin Core Alliance "aka "CORE"" and the Bitcoin Cash Militia (both of which were allies at one point in overthrowing "The Regime" which was essentially China, Russia, and the US (which were the major superpowers in winning World War 4)) when the CORE/BCM war starts, thats when you had better warn anyone you love to get out of BCM and join CORE because anyone with a Bitcoin Cash address who didn't switch over was mass tortured along with the rest of the militia. Wiped out entirely. So for me its been cocaine and strippers in easy living in the citadel. tldr sell all assets now for bitcoin and dump your bitcoin cash. I have to go, I don't have much time but I will update soon to explain more. I've tried before, but that post was not ever taken seriously, (and also that was before I ever went into the future (first post was in like 2025 or something I think)) This is my friends account. OK SERIOULLSY HAVE TO GO.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:46:27
I got one for 70 during black friday weekend. then the day before it arrived i fucking panic sold my bitcoin at 9k. now i have half the amount of bitcoin I had.

@_date: 2018-09-18 17:30:20
That is absolutely not true lmao. What? Dude plenty of people hate bitcoin. Personally I sold all of my bitcoin and now only hold altcoins in the top 20
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:08:38
I’ll sell you one for two
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:21:08
Snapchat I believe 
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:44:45
Could you explain what using margin to run the price up means ?
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:27:06
You’re calling someone a serial poster when literally every other comment as I scroll down multiple posts is you. ��
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:43:17
Wait what do you mean margin buy l? What is that and how can it raised the price 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:50:18
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:42:18
Good question 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:57:59
Ok what about my case, and the current state of affairs (ridiculous upswing with no balance back down) I bought in at 3k... then it went to 11, and i was messing around on gdax and sort of accidently (but also becuase gdax CRASHED THE SECOND it went from 11- 9k in ten seconds and right back up) PANIC SOLD my entire stack... no DCA.  nothing. the entire thing gone at 9k. 
So im sitting here thinking and hoping there is going to be some sort of major correction soon before or during when futures launches...
Im in a pickle because I really dont want to buy in at this ridiculously high all time high that has me suspicious whales are going to dump any second now, but at the same time I could buy in right now and still be way in the green. :/ I just dont want to buy in now and it drops like crazy suddenly.
Any advice is welcomed.

I didn’t say you “respect women by getting laid” ... but you can absolutely respect women and still get laid dude. Women like to have sex too. The guy below is right, not going to argue with some dude on a crypto sub. Especially about fucking bitcoin cash like you’re trying to get me to react to. I’ll let that be your entire life talking about how roger ver and bcash sucks on reddit.
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:50:45
It just seems to me like they’re buying bitcoin with bitcoin... or is it they’re just doing a leveraged position WITH bitcoin to sell at a higher price ??
I’ve never done leveraged trading but I think I understand it somewhat at least for shorting 
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:36:09
I read somewhere a couple guys were talking about this on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:37:39
thats rigiht when i bought in. then i fucking panic sold at that TWO second tip when gdax went down and it went from 11k-9k.... waiting for a dip any second now....

This is the high quality investment advice I come here for.

How do you figure? I can cash everything out into USD....... I can cash everything out right now and it would have nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:56:13
Uhh because I’m very much into crypto and bitcoin leads this market. Am I supposed to stop following and learning about something just because I don’t own it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:47:28

He knows that he means what increments of time. This could show one minute of time or six months if not labeled. But it does say a year so I’m assuming it’s a year

It’s not like they’re reporting and claiming what they’ve treated for. It averages out what they’re actually trading for on multiple exchanges

@_date: 2018-09-21 21:26:14
Yes that was a pretty clearly sexist statement. Usually made by immature fucks who never get laid or know how to respect women. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:37:17
What.. I don’t think that’s true. Otherwise there would be a coin that did that and it would be ahead of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:34:00
Do I have to know a ton about bitcoin to figure this out? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:36:52

Dude listen to this guy’s post for real. Also thanks for explaining about the disadvantages of larger block size I kept wondering what the reason bitcoin wouldn’t do that to compete was

@_date: 2017-11-30 07:40:39
I held since 2600 even as it lingered around 1500 and yet I️ fucking panic sell at 9000 today like a dumbass. Also sort of got screwed by Gdax going down... dying for it to go below 9 for one more dip to get back in. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:09:52
Haha loser

@_date: 2017-11-04 12:15:00
It was just a joke..
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:22:44

@_date: 2017-11-24 12:12:20
I️ did last night also. I️ just was unsure if the deal was activated yet. It seemed like it was, it had like 59€ crossed out and said 46€ roughly, is that what you paid? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:38:39
Lol your arguments are so weak

If I’m trying to buy can I️ do a limit buy at like 9000 and it’ll create market orders at 9000 and below?? It wouldn’t go higher ?

@_date: 2017-11-13 06:18:13
No... my bch is not wherever my btc was during the fork because jaxx hasn’t credited it yet to their users as far as I know
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:05:29
Man jaxx wallet still not giving bch yet right 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:18:20
