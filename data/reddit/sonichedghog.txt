Mr Satoshi, tear down that wall!

Since I enjoy making baseless claims here goes:
Personally I feel like we have way more dip to come. The price rose way too quickly over the course of a month and we never even dipped back down to November levels, so if I had to place a bet right now I'd say it wouldn't be unreasonable for us to see 4k 5k 6k or 7k levels again.
But that's the beautiful thing about Bitcoin, it doesn't give a shit about me or you, only about the Picasso bots of the world!

Bitcoin was more or less written off. I bought in during the '13 spike and had friends call me out for being risky. Then during the impending crash they all laughed at how the little experiment was over.
I hadn't completely written Bitcoin off, I decided to keep buying in as it went down little by little over the course of 2 years. That's the most absurd thing I find about this sub these days. When the price goes down 10-15% people expect a bounce back within a week. I spent two years looking at a slowly depreciating price ha!
I kept buying in to lower my average to the point where I was comfortable with the amount of risk I had taken with my magical internet money. 
A couple other interesting anecdotes from the time. I'd say the feeling of being too late in the ball game never really goes away. We all thought we were too late back then but were too interested not to do anything with Bitcoin. The currency really went through some dark times. The suicide help line was stickied at the top of the sub multiple times, and people had some pretty scary stories about how much they've lost. 
Also generally speaking the sub had more of a us vs. them mentality. There was no eth or hard forks, it was really all of crypto pulling for each other. That's another surprising thing I see how split the community is sometimes. 
My biggest advice I can give is to not become obsessed to the point where you're taking unnecessary risks. Go about your life! You should treat it as some risky side 401k investment that might turn you into a millionaire or might go belly up. At the very least don't let the price affect your mood. And if you care about the currency keep trumpeting support for it but keep things civil. It IS risky. It IS NOT guaranteed to go up.
Oh and big thanks to To The Moon Guy, he's always out a smile on my face as long as I've been coming to this sub haha.

Always mixed, the core believers believed in the tech and even though the price went down there were always cool stories to rally behind like Bitcoin atms or restaurants coming to your city or overstock taking Bitcoin. Plenty of cool use cases to get excited about. I'd say the mania didn't start until this summer though ;)

The best way to play it safe is cost average yourself down. Take whatever you want to invest in Bitcoin and divide in half, thirds, fourths, etc whatever. Then go ahead and out that first little bit in now. If it goes down put a little more in and you've lowered your average cost of coin down. If it goes up then congrats you've already made some profit.
Don't try to time dips, don't get greedy. As a hodler from 2013 and someone who's held at a loss for 2 years, only invest in Bitcoin if you're willing to be in it for the long run and not looking to make a quick buck.

I couldn't agree more. It's also annoying and essentially ineffective. Just because you want btc to go up doesn't mean you can wish/complain it up.

At the same time Zynga share price has been steadily on the rise for the past year. It could just be the new CEO's way of increasing revenue and exploring new markets.

Thanks actually this is pretty much what I was looking for! Lot of good articles linked/archived
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:38:49
As much of Debbie downer that sounds like honestly I agree. As a very long time hodler everything has peaks and valleys and I think it's only time for it to cough up some of the massive gains. But that too will pass to even bigger gains in a couple years... 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:03:11
I'll give em a listen
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:25:24
Yeah what is up with the bots? Kind of unsettling for some reason. Also TO THE MOON! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:40:58
Yeah honestly I think this article is somewhat fair and even emphasizes how Bitcoin has been proclaimed dead in the past and it came back stronger... Eventually

Any cryptocurrency can be split in theory since all of these cryptocurrencies (BTC and BCH) are open source. 
A hard fork is just a specific update to the code base that is typically incompatible with the previous core code, yet honors all previous transactions on the block chain.
So if you wanted to, you could create Bitcoin cash 2.0, with a minor update to the open source code that somehow tweaked the way it behaves (longer mining times, lower difficulty, higher hard cap on total amount of coins, etc.)
The key is that for a hard fork to be "successful" it needs backers that are willing to adopt and trade and update the coin, and most importantly mine it to verify the transactions.

Unfortunately no I'll have to call... 
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:51:18
Haha ok that'll be my backup plan
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:10:11
Thanks for the reply. So I should just sit tight even though it's not showing up in my orders yet?

I did and they were forwarded on to one other account right away but haven't moved since. Overstock.com said they can't do anything since I didn't pay with Bitcoin from a Coinbase wallet... (I thought you could use any wallet to pay...)
