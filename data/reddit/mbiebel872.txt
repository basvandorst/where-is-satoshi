I'll double check my system resources, but my computer prompted me whether I wanted to run the scripts and I said no, obviously.

I got a similar email this morning, I opened up the .docx, but when I went to view the files inside they were microsoft visual basic scripts. Obviously never run scripts from an untrusted source.
This is what was inside the scripts:
Anything that ends with "LOoP UntiL eRr.NumbeR &lt;&gt; 0" Can't be good.

As somebody who already jumped on the bandwagon too late, back in 2012, let me tell you to forget about mining right now. The difficulty is too high and so is the cost of electric to run the hardware. If you buy hardware today, unless the value of the coin skyrockets, you will never break even. Unless you want to convert electricity into cryptocurrency at a loss for fun.
If you are looking at your options right now, and $50 is all you are willing to invest and you are willing to risk that money, than I would say just straight buy a fraction of a BTC with that $50 and hold on to it.
In 2140, when all the coins are minted, supply will cut off. If demand continues and supply stops increasing, the value of the BTC could rise incredibly. People like the Winklevoss twins believe BTC could be worth upwards of $40,000 per coin in the future.
If you take $50 today, while BTC is down around $225, you'll wind up with a little less than .25 BTC. If BTC is ever worth $40K, that $50 could become $10,000.
Alternatively, BTC could plummet in value, becoming worthless and you could lose $50.
I think the odds are worth it.
Just don't buy a mining contract. I bought one with .69 BTC, wound up with .16 in the end. If you have good video cards like Radeon R9 series, you can mine cryptocurrency for fun. But you will operate at a loss and that's more of a hobby than an investment.
Look at a website like Cryptsy, where you can trade your BTC for other currencies and speculate on more exchange rates than you can imagine.

I'm thinking it would be like a zero-sum, single server, open world sandbox type MMORPG, which would be based on the limited resources of the global economy of the game, which would all be in a perpetual flux. Most of the games that are popular are games which were designed with one thing in mind but which the players take to the next level. So I'd like it to be a game where the players aren't restricted.

Well, every idea has to start somewhere. I was sort of just probing the community to see what kind of things people would like to see. Like, another hack and slash medieval MMO or a futuristic Mass Effect type game. There are so many MMO out there, its hard to come up with a unique game concept, so what I'm focusing on right now is brainstorming the mechanics of the currency.
By myself I'm just a hobbyist Bitcoin miner with some basic knowledge of coding, but if this were to be accomplished I would need to put together a team as well as community support.

Yeah, but I'm thinking of something with a little more advanced of an engine than Civilization from 1991. ;)
