Historically in Bitcoin, the way around brute-forcing a hash is performing a reorg or forking. In those cases the energy burden to attack is far less than the initial energy spent attempting to solve.

I'm discussing the wasteful nature of Bitcoin mining with someone who made an overly-broad and childish remark about those who would dare to recognize its wastefulness. A common misconception is that hashrate somehow makes the network more secure, when the vast majority of that hashing power may never perform a beneficial function to the network whatsoever. In extreme cases, purpose-built hardware with an extraordinarily short lifespan consumes a huge amount of energy without providing any value to humanity at all. And after its brief useful life, it becomes trash or is recycled. In my opinion, the ends do not justify the means.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:28:36
Would it be any less sound if the miners who do not solve were performing a beneficial function while mining, such as using their computing power to analyze astrophysics models? Or if they eliminated possibilities for the eventual winner?
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:13:45
Everything you described concerns itself only with the winner. Nodes don’t concern themselves with any of the other participants in the race, just that the winner has the right answer.
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:34:08
How do miners incentivize investment in security of the network? Just because a thing may not be cumulatively more wasteful than another, does not mean it is not wasteful itself.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:05:51
Good. Because one could easily infer it was based on your previous comment. As long as we are clear the miners that do not solve the proof of work contribute the same value to humanity as someone pulling a lever of a slot machine.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:51:26
My point was the vast majority of the energy is consumed by those that do not solve. That majority does not provide any benefit to the network, nor does it eliminate any possibilities for the eventual winner. There is a small element of chance, however given enough time, owning a % of the hashrate will statistically yield that same % in rewards.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:29:35
What is the purpose of all the computational power expended and energy consumed for all the miners which attempted, but did not solve, the proof of work for a given block? Those resources were spent unsuccessfully pulling a lever of a slot machine. Except this slot machine provides no entertainment value to a human being.
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:39:39
Inefficiency is waste and invites optimization. We design computer systems to perform tasks. In this case, the system is designed so miners which do not solve the proof of work suffer the loss of their computational power and energy. However, that power and energy could have been tasked with doing a  beneficial task.
For the sake of argument, imagine if the electricity and computational power required is replaced with human labor. The time and effort invested could have been better spent building bridges or buildings.

And like the Bible, all criticisms are forever and always silenced by the holy gospel of the white paper. Trust us, it’s in there if you interpret it correctly.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:44:27
You can't compare a race between humans, where people derive their own value from the activity, with mining, where a computer performs the same hashing function indefinitely until a condition is met. It is more comparable to a computer pulling the lever of a slot machine and distributing earnings to its owner. And each time the lever is pulled consumes a considerable amount of resources. So yes, for every 1 winner, the other 99 which consumed resources to pull the lever wasted those resources.

@_date: 2019-07-06 01:51:18
So your argument that mining is not wasteful because it’s not as cumulatively wasteful as other things that consume energy? It’s very possible a miner can consume energy without ever solving a single proof of work during its entire useful life.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:29:44
As someone who jumped on board recently that appreciates the tech and opportunity to change the way money is handled forever, I find the whole "dumb money" and "noob" sentiment tremendously off-putting. How does one show support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency today without  buying into a highly speculative market? I don't think you can.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:03:06
How about frugal people who don't like waste? Every miner that does not solve a given proof of work has wasted all the computing power and all the energy consumed attempting to solve it.
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:48:11
My initial response was to the commenter who felt that a rational person should never criticize Bitcoin's energy usage. Not that any other consensus mechanism is better. So my burden is explaining why a rational person would believe PoW is wasteful. But yes, both PoS and DAG mechanisms are objectively less wasteful.
Optimization is eliminating inefficiencies and streamlining with the purpose of improving the whole. There is no straw man argument in recognizing a wasteful component of a system's design which could potentially be optimized away. The existence of less wasteful consensus mechanisms indicates a potential to reduce or eliminate that waste altogether.

Does Uber make sense? There is no fixed cost for a ride from point A to B. In the scenario we're discussing, the cost is always the fair market value plus their markup. The fair market value factors in their cost of doing business, competitor pricing, supply levels, promotions or discounts, and a bunch more. I'm suggesting this could easily factor in the current market value of currencies their customers want to use. And yes, this could be either fiat or cryptocurrencies.
This kind of price fluctuation already happens today, albeit very slowly. There is no reason to think this could be done much more efficiently in a digitally pervasive future, possibly in real-time. Buyers would always get a fair price and sellers could cover their markup. Nobody loses purchasing power because market fluctuations are quickly factored into costs.

But only the downside volatility right? It's fine if goes up 10% in one day.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:04:23
That makes zero sense. If you agree to a transaction using a given medium of exchange, you implicitly agree to accept ownership of that medium: regardless of whether it increases or decreases in value afterward. 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
Becoming a stable payment medium will not occur because 1 BTC equals a fixed amount of money in fiat, it will occur when enough people recognize they can use that BTC in exchange for other goods and services. Alternatively, they could save it knowing it will likely increase in value over time due to its store of value properties.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:07:21
And having another viable currency to use which could be less expensive depending on the situation and potentially in higher demand than fiat is bad?

What you're describing has less to do with the projects themselves and more to due with cryptocurrencies being such a speculative market. Clearly the market still has an appetite for high risk/reward.

I disagree the use cases for decentralized apps are narrow and need censorship resistance and trustlessness in order to be useful. Today, web services are pretty much standard component of new applications, which allows for programmatic access to portions of their application. I predict smart contract platforms will be the standard way to do this in the future for a couple reasons. One, such a service would be highly distributed and fault tolerant from day one, reducing the costs and resources required to scale to meet increasing demand. Not to mention application data would be encrypted by default and auditable by anyone. Second, commerce can be done via the smart contract platform's native currency so much more efficiently than the payment gateways, merchant processor integration, and all the fees that go along with it to accept credit card payments today.
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:30:44
It's a paradox, just like its underlying cryptography. It needs to have a high valuation in order for people to adopt it over fiat, and it needs adoption to justify its high valuation and utility. The truth is this decentralized currency experiment has never been attempted at this scale before, so there is no blessed path.

I find Bitcoin maximalists insufferable. Specifically, the ego that only their project has value and that only they have a monopoly on reading the tea leaves. And in this case, if you don't agree, apparently you qualify as stupid. What about the outcomes and possibilities you haven't considered? Which, by the way, grows considerably the more closed-minded you are about a topic. What about the innovation and expertise which can only blossom from having legitimate competition? What about identifying talent and the education and inspiration gained by evaluating other upstart projects based on their merit?

Microsoft were best positioned in the tech industry to capitalize, so why didn't they?
Every altcoin will never do what Bitcoin does out of the gate. But that doesn't mean the project never has any hope to compete or they or the people who support it are stupid or ignorant of monetary economics. It just means they're not Bitcoin.

Dapps will have limited, but increasing appeal as more businesses suffer more frequent and higher profile ransomware attacks and data breaches. Progress will be slow as current decentralized smart contract solutions are slower, more complex, and more expensive than their centralized counterparts. However, I predict a similar shift as we saw with the early internet browsers where AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, and their proprietary counterparts gave way to open source and open standards.
We've seen each time we see a run up in price, a new wave of investment, entrepreneurs, and talent floods the industry. With that much experience and considerable resources, I'd be willing to bet there will be a killer dapp created in the next 5 years.

When businesses see they can save money protecting against hacks and provide more security and transparency to its customers by decentralizing their infrastructure.

Code is law. You can review every line of code right [here]( None of those lines of code allow special access or backdoors which governments can use to cheat the system. Assuming your theory of initially being created for nefarious purposes is true and we discover 51% of miners have been compromised, we would all just rally around a fork which has not been compromised.
You don't have to be a HODLer to benefit from the technology. And everyone should be treating it with every bit of skepticism a speculative market deserves. I just take issue when people trying to put some magic price on it when literally nobody knows what it will become in the future.
As long as there is progress, advancement, and adoption in the space the price will increase because that is how it was designed.

Crypto doesn't have to be a zero sum game. Bitcoin can learn from Ethereum and other altcoins, incorporating some things, and making it a better Bitcoin.
What altcoins should avoid doing is trying to be a better Bitcoin - they will lose *coughbcashcough*. They'd benefit more by standing on their own and adding their own unique, useful features. This is exactly what Ethereum is doing.

The first part is true. But it also highlights one reason why Bitcoin will succeed. Bitcoin can adapt in ways our current payment systems cannot. Lightning Network has huge potential for near instant, low cost peer to peer transactions which don't require the rigor and time inherent with on-chain settlement. For both the user and merchant, all they need is the software for a payment to be made.
Compare with popular payment methods today which require credit cards, bank accounts, merchant accounts, payment processors, etc. Each of which have their own application and verification process producing valuable artifacts: prime targets for hacks and leaks.
As for the volatility, that is something that can only be solved with maturity. Bitcoin can't use threat of warfare and forced adoption to guarantee its value like our government can.

Regardless of the price on a given day, risk still exists. 70% dips don't bother you much when you've got $1000 in the market. If you had $100k or $1M in the market, a 70% dip would make you vomit.
What does one do to counteract this? Diversify, take profits, and reinvest during downturns. Wanna know what makes for stable market and in Bitcoin's case, a stable currency? I'll give a hint: it's not day traders and speculators. It's not even hodlers. It's people taking profits from Bitcoin and reinvesting it back into Bitcoin over and over again.

It doesn't work that way. Owning a ton of one asset is extremely risky, so the people that want to keep their wealth will sell some and diversify into other assets: real estate, venture capital, stocks, etc. Also there will always be speculators who think it's overpriced and want to sell in hopes they can buy it later cheaper.

Fiat currency is physical Monopoly money backed by threat of war (economic or otherwise).
The idea of programmable money, aka money that does more than denote its own value, is almost an absolute certainty in the near future. It is too valuable and tenacious an idea to be just considered merely hype. Nobody knows if Bitcoin will continue to be the standard bearer for that idea in the future, but it is the most influential one that exists today.
While rampant speculation does obscure the true value, it also produces the perfect conditions for significant and lasting innovation to occur.
We live in a world where all we’ve ever known is fiat currency. Dismissing better alternatives is simply a failure of imagination.

The fact that every altcoins price action is so correlated to Bitcoin's is both a positive and negative. Clearly, Bitcoin keeps their price afloat when the market would have killed the bad ones off long ago. But it also obscures which altcoins could potentially stand on their own two feet, which exacerbates the problem.
Short version: altcoin investors wouldn't chase prices so much if they weren't so closely correlated to BTC.

You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin at whatever market rate is at the current time, and use said fractions for whatever goods and services you want, anywhere in the world for a very small fee.

Accumulating cheap bitcoins should be the end game (ie. HODL).
By all means, sell into fiat to make your life more comfortable, but you should also be thinking about buying cheaper coins later. The number of businesses accepting bitcoins will continue to increase as it becomes more widely adopted. Even if you're not convinced bitcoin is going to be the dominant crypto forever, there is a very high probability you'll be able to acquire the next generation with your bitcoins.

Did you read that article? “Weak productivity helps explain why companies are reluctant to raise workers’ wages, even as profit margins have improved.” What?
It doesn’t take an economics degree to see where stagnant wages, reduced market participation, skyrocketing debt, and an inflationary currency leads.
While people may be in the habit of converting to/from fiat now, wait a few more years. When more people realize they won’t ever have to pay ATM fees or an overdraft charge ever again.  When business owners realize they don’t have to deal with massive merchant account fees. When people start stockpiling it because in a few years it’ll be worth a boring 5-10% annually.

My perspective is a short squeeze was inevitable. Every rally was being sold off immediately (see multiple Bart heads on chart) so there was no incentive for bulls to rally. Sell volume has been decreasing since we hit ATH back in December, and without any rallies there wasn't much sell pressure happening to drive the price down and scare people. All bears could do is stack shorts and wait. All the whale(s) had to do was spike the price and force bears to cover.

No. If there is nobody to buy the short side of your long contract or vice versa, there is no contract. The person I replied to is describing massive coordinated manipulation in one direction once the contract expires. That's unrealistic for a couple reasons. 1) Contracts are settled in USD, not Bitcoin. 2) Futures exchange volume has been consistently low, which limits their potential effect on the market.
In my opinion, it's much more feasible that speculation around futures expiration affects price far more than investors involved in futures trading.

It's 100% psychology. If too many people blindly believe its the new paradigm and are willing to risk everything in fear of missing out, it's a bubble.

Decentralization is not a feature either. Fault tolerance, attack resistance, and collusion resistance are the goal and each exist on a spectrum. And to achieve each, one needs to recognize there were trade-offs made to accomplish them. Is there an opportunity to achieve these goals to a lesser degree than Bitcoin and offer things that Bitcoin cannot? I say yes. Can that project also benefit more from the transparency, traceability, and immutability the blockchain data structure provides than using a traditional database? Again I say yes, but Bitcoin maximalists would have you believe otherwise.
