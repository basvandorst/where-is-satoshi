Nobody can tell you anything that is certain truth, but Bitcoin has yet to fail to recover following a dip. 
20k by end of year is not unreasonable, as this is the old ATH, and the bcash run appears to be over now. 200k by the end of 2018 would be reasonable assuming approximately half of 2017's growth.

If bitcoin moves slowly up/down or stays level, alts generally rise. If bitcoin moves quickly up/down, alts generally fall.

Mycelium is popular on here, breadwallet is probably the most user-friendly. Long-term definitely consider getting a hardware wallet.

CoinBase is the most user-friendly exchange, but also has some of the highest fees. To get started, sign up for an account, submit identifying documents and wait until you're verified. After that, use a SEPA transfer or add your credit card (higher fees) to fill your EUR or USD wallet. Once your funds are available, buy Bitcoin on the buy/sell tab. Note that Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin, and that you can buy any fraction that you want.
Cryptocurrency uses private keys to secure funds. When you keep your Bitcoin on an exchange, the exchange is in control of your private keys. A wallet is a way of letting you control your own private keys, and as such is safer. The breadwallet app is a very user-friendly wallet, but for larger amounts a physical hardware wallet such as the Ledger Nano S is a good idea. Both of these wallets have clear instructions on how to send Bitcoin to them included.

A limit order means you set the price and buyers/sellers fill that order by being willing to buy/sell at your price.
Market orders exhaust the best available sell/buy limit orders until your chosen amount is bought/sold.
Stop limit orders are limit orders set when the price reaches a certain value you decide on (for example, if the price falls below X, sell).

A good time to buy of course! Bitcoin has yet to fail to rebound and gone through much steeper dips than this. Don't see it failing now.

It's not the hot hand fallacy. Bitcoin went on a bull run away from the median growth. It was due for a dip. The launch of two sets of futures and bcash pumping as a result of being added to Coinbase triggered it. This is not a big blow for Bitcoin by any means, which is why I'm confident in a recovery.

Bitcoin threatens big money. Big money pays media to denounce it.
