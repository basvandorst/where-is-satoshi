Yes, Gavin, spread the gospel of big blocks to the world!  We must move Bitcoin into data centers so the peons can't validate the rules of their money and we'll be at the top of the pyramid.   Muhahahaha!

Increase the blocksize already!  There's no reason to trust a bunch of miners in China.   We must clean up bitcoin anyway to make it mainstream.  That's the only way we can get the moon!  Bigger, faster, stronger, Merica!

2017 was dumb money, that's why alt's pumped.  Now smart money is moving into Bitcoin.

Alt season is not coming back until after Bitcoin reaches new ATH, and people are so euphoric that they go gambling on shitcoins.

Hypothetically, in a post fiat world, when governments can no longer print money, if we the protest and stop paying taxes, the government literally becomes unfunded, dies and we drop back to a free market economy, to then build a better one that isn't outrageously inefficient.

They have to do a good job, and they can send me a bill.   But most things that they do today will be opened up to the free market, or replaced with smart contracts.

It's getting expensive to attach a tracking transaction to every withdraw...need more room ASAP.

You know what they say about guys who want big blocks right?

Because he's the dumbest man in bitcoin and it's entertaining laughing at him.

My data-center too! The VCs that funded me think this is the best plan forward. Since we're building the next Paypal, there's no need for the little guy to run a node.  We have APIs you can use, we have wallets, we have a vault, we have it all under control.  Trust us.
