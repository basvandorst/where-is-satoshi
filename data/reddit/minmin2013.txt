I heard that it was all down to the ergot fungus infecting the wheat and grain causing huge populations to trip and hallucinate...I prefer that idea.

I just had my ads removed because I mentioned that I also accept Bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:59:04
I've been using them for a while, never had any trouble or delays.
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:16:12
Well there you go.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:24:02
Can I get a link to that statement?
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:25:48
They just removed my ad for selling random crap because I said I accepted Bitcoin....no idea what their problem is.

Hey jerroldp, any chance of the Coinjar app coming to Android?  I know it's unlikely you'll make one for ipod touch 4, but if I could get it on my Android it would be a start and most useful! :)

As far as I'm aware when you open Bitcoin-QT it has to download the database of previous transactions from the blockchain.
(Someone please correct me if I'm wrong).   
If you use your few laptops that are lying around to mine using CPU or GPU you will be spending more on electricity than you will ever be getting back in Bitcoins.

Be nice if I could get it for iOS 6, I can't update my ipod touch 4 to iOS7 so I can't get this app :(

Just do it.  If you're selling merch at your gigs just put up a sign saying you accept bitcoin, then anyone with a phone on their wallet can go ahead and purchase some tasty tunes from you using their fantastical magical internet money! :D

The wallet will sych eventually, it can take ages to download the blockchain.
Don't mine, it's not worth it if you are using CPU or GPU, just buy coins through an exchange.

Thanks!  I'll give it a go when I get home from work :)

Wahey!  Another backpacker using BTCs!   I just started using Coinjar too....shame I can't get the app for my ipod touch 4 or my Android phone though....that would be awesome! 
Just out of curiosity, which state are you in?
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:43:02
Not sure if this is legit, but they are also selling 1 BTC for approx $500....which seams to be a couple hundred short of the market price at the moment..........
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:47:38
They won't let you, but it's easier to get forgiveness than permission...especially when you're $6.5 mil richer ;)

I visted the address &amp; it created the different types of wallet address for me (cold storage would be a paper wallet right?), however if I'm not sure how I can go about visiting that page offline....It obviously comes up with the "unable to connect" page.  How do I go about opening the page offline?
Sorry for not really knowing what I'm doing, but that's for all your help! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:12:14
Wow!  I got one off ebay for about $7.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:16:49
Yeah, I'd love to see some more solid evidence or reference material for this scamming of 60K of BTC....if it's true then I'm not going to use them again! 
I haven't had issues as I haven't bought or sold anything for a while....I would have bought today but I've been seeing all this shit about CoinJar delays that it's put me off.
Where else can us Australian's buy online (aside from LocalBitcoins)?
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:10:42
I did this a while back too.  Sadly no-one offered to pay in BTC.
Have you had anyone buy with BTC yet?
