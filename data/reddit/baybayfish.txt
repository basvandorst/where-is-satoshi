Crypto coins have no ownership, so officials can give these coins to their sons and daughters as digital assets. Such bill is useless.

BTC, BCH, LTC need more real life day to day application development now to fly higher, achieve $100K goal and sustain it.
We need POS machine, bank machine, mobile payment etc to accept and process crypto transactions. We need hotel, travel agency, airlines, supermarkets, Apple store, Google store, Samsung store etc to accept it, as digital currency, otherwise it is like a digital gold which some potential only.

When you totally forget about fiat currency and move the fiat currency out of the equation, then the value of bitcoin never changes. 1 bitcoin yesterday is the same 1 bitcoin today. Forget about BTC/USD exchange, then it becomes the real currency.

People need to realize, all crypto coins are pretty much on the same boat and share the same fate. There are only two camps, the crypto supporters, and the haters. 
Bitcoin price increase is positive for the entire crypto industry. Bitcoin lose is what the crypto haters want. 
So no more internal fighting. We are on the same boat. The gun shall be pointed to the mainstream media and banks.

If crypto currency price goes so low in 2018, bitmain will not have much business. Bitmain shall use the $2.3B to protect the crypto currency price. Now it is not profitable anymore for mining with the power hungry bitmain ASIC miners.

No worry. Forget it for now. The mining hardware company and supply chain beneficiary will push the bitcoin price sky high in 2018, so their business can continue. Now it is a good time to buy in more.
