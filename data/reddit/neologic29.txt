In some ways you're even more vulnerable storing on an exchange. That's how a lot of people have lost their nest eggs, by the exchange getting hacked and/or someone at the exchange making off with your coins because *they* control your private keys which means *they* own your coins.

That may be true, although you don't really need VPN/tor to be safe with cryptos. If you're not trading large volumes, then it might be a good idea to at least put the bulk of your holdings in a [paper wallet.]( That is a relatively low-tech way of "cold" storage (i.e. offline storage).

If you miss type the PIN  three times, does it wipe only that wallet or both wallets?

Something I haven't seen mentioned here yet, but was a concern for me buying from Amazon, is confirming that the seller is one of the authorized retailers. Amazon might facilitate deliveries from third party sellers who aren't authorized by Ledger to resell their products.

Ok, thanks!

Fucking coinbase delaying my wire transfer has cost me thousands. Fuck!

Yes, good point.

No the idea is for it to be able to handle more transactions, but the scalability of the tech is something that's being worked on right now. There are various solutions that have been proposed and/or implemented, some that result in forking of the blockchain creating new currencies (e.g. bitcoin cash) and others like lightning network that are built on top of the basic bitcoin framework.

So when you run Bitcoin Core (this is the wallet software, correct?) does that mean you initially have 100 addresses to which you can potentially send your bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:04
No, the hardware wallet will have its own private key. I'm not sure you could even get the private key for the exchange wallet.

For ACH, maybe. Wire transfers are generally same day if made before the cutoff.  I've done two wires from Wells Fargo and they were in the next day because I made them after the cutoff on the previous day.

That's all fine to say they may not be informed on something. Especially something as intricate as the nuts and bolts of a crypotocurrency payment network. The problem comes in where they insist on legislating on a topic they have no business even discussing casually at a party.

You're not alone. It seems like the more I research, the more I end up finding out how much there is to still understand. I'm wanting to dip my feet in the pool, but I still don't quite get the nuances of acquiring and storing cryptocurrencies. It's like a never-ending rabbit hole.
Every time I think I have a handle on something, I'll see someone make a comment and realize I am missing quite a large piece of the puzzle.

Click on "Advanced" and uncheck the box for Post Only, this will allow your order to be on the books while it waits for the price you set the limit at to be reached.

So is the idea that you just have dozens of wallets, each with their own private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:12:19
It doesn't look like there are any posts on that sub.

It is generally not safe to keep cryptos on an exchange for extended periods of time. You don't control the private key for where the currencies are stored so you technically don't own them. You can look into getting a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S. It keeps the public/private key pair stored on a device which remains offline until connected to a computer to make transactions.  I think hardware wallets are a good compromise between the ease of use of software wallets and the security of cold storage.

The "nobody cares" is in reference to the bullish news, not the actual market activity.

So you agree the sentence was unjust, but still don't think it should factor in to how people feel about him being locked up? He's served time, so it's not like letting him go would be getting off scot-free.
