Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:56:14
Gahh, nooo!  I bought some yesterday and it was my first time, so they're not letting me buy anymore yet!  Damn it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:48:02
Wait, I'm confused then.  Why *wouldn't* you sell when the price peaks like said?  You could avoid the crash altogether and cash out beforehand.

Quick question - so you add the address to blockchain.info as watch-only, but can you still send coins to the address and add to your storage?  Or is it completely untouchable?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:20:02
Well like I said, if prices go down (which they most likely will), I plan on buying more.  Again, not much, but more than $20 worth.
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:27:51
Bah, I don't care if people know.  I just bought this week, and I've put in about $250 for .3BTC.  That's all I care to invest for the time being.  If the price has a dramatic dip, say, below $500, maybe I'll put in a bit more.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:25:26
Don't we know because we see the price on Coinbase and Mt.Gox?
I'm sorry, I'm still learning the ropes to this, and I know these are probably dumb questions.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:20:36
It's tough to break into, but I'm slowly learning the game.  It's just a lot to take in - you're inundated with information, countless websites, processes, tips, advice, lingo, charts, it's confusing.  But I've got my BTC and I'm slowly learning.

You'll also cry tears of joy when the gun explodes in his face because it's made of plastic.

You know what they say.  The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.  The second best time is now.

*Finally* someone explains it so that a total moron can do it.  Thank you.  I am saving this for future reference.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:33:09
I agree with it, but feel it was a tad bit rude.  Especially


Describing Bitcon as "mind-blowingly awesome" makes you sound like every other internet twat out there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:46:05
Noob here.  So what I gather from this is, you can't sell your Bitcoins unless there are people out there who are also buying bitcoins.  But if you notice the price is high and put through a request to sell Bitcoins, and you are unable to sell, it will sell at the next opportunity, whether that price is at $1000 or $1.  Is that accurate?
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:24:46
I can see where they're coming from.  Right now I have .1BTC because I'm very hesitant to put any more money in.  I don't have a steady income, so any major purchases (or investments) have to be really thought out.  When you hear about people striking it rich, they never talk about how they cashed out their .5BTC or their .03BTC.  It's usually how they bought 100BTC because they had the capital to do so.  And good for them, wish I could be in their shoes.  But for someone who doesn't have as much money to their name, of course you don't want to risk all you've got, no matter what the "guarantee" looks like.  Of course I had already made my money back by the time the price went up again after my buy, but unless you have a large chunk of BTC, it's a negligible amount.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:35:39
It is *ON!*
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:41:24
You are just so full of yourself.  Pathetic.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:19:19
Hey, so do I!
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:56:13
That guy has *four ears!*
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:11:22
You know, maybe it's me, but I would think there comes a point where however much extra money you have wouldn't really matter.  If I had $145 million, I'd probably never have to work again in my life.  Sure, even half that and I'd probably never have to work again.  So I guess what I'm saying is, if I were in this situation, I'd cash out half and see where the other half takes me.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:50:10
Is it okay if I go both ways?  I want to keep a good portion of my bitcoins (75% at least) for holding, but use a few for day trading.  Is that harmful?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:21:36
*Turd* sandwich.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:33:20
Well yeah... but I'm just starting out, so I think it's fair for me to be confused.  ^Right?
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:53:38
I doubt it.  I thought the bubble in April was the big climax of Bitcoin before stability.  But it's proven that it will keep going up and up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:52:30
I held because I had no idea there was a crash to begin with.  Yay, laziness.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:15:46
So everyone switches to a credit union...
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:56:45
I don't.  I want to keep some for holding and use some for day trading.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:08:02
I'm gonna have to disagree.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:58:33
You are getting your son into stocks and now Bitcoin, at a very early age.  Good on ya.  While his friends are all pining for jobs in high school, he can kick back and watch the ticker rise.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:09:18
Pfeh.. right now if the price "rocketed back" to $120, I'd jump on the boat pronto.  Amazing how things change in perspective over time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:16:27
Which would you say is the better site to buy?  I have an order pending through Coinbase, but it hasn't been keeping track of the current price because it's overloaded.  Should I be using Mt.Gox instead?  I'm a little more concerned about my account being hacked there, so I'm hesitant to link a bank account to it.

O Fortuna, Fight Club, and Guy Fawkes masks... hard to take this video seriously.

So much this.  So long as the dollar remains the dominant currency (or Euro, or Pound, etc.), there is no good reason to needlessly spend Bitcoins when you know there's a good chance that they will continue to increase in value dollar-wise.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:48:41
Excellent, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:47:00
Kraken's been getting some attention lately.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:47:07
What exactly is the long run?  What are we waiting for?
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:18:28
Just throwing it out there...
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:16:19
I am not made of money, so I cannot really afford to put a lot of cash into this.  I want to start small.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:04:16
I can't remember, to be honest.  I think it was before it seized up - I don't remember seeing any kind of notice or checkbox, and they didn't stop me for not checking something.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:58:08
Uh... all of them?
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:26:51
Pft yeah, only a few thousand.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:20:30
But it wouldn't matter, because dollars now have no value.  That's my point, who cares how many dollars a Bitcoin is worth when supposedly the system is going to fail.  So what's going to happen to all these Bitcoin exchanges?
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:19:55
But when it's finished, will I be getting exactly what I was told I'd get when I made the transaction?  At least, is that how it normally works? (I understand it may have seized up with all the activity)
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:35:28
Doesn't that require verifying a credit card?  I don't know if I want to do that...

Okay, that's very good to know.  Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:53:29
Mind explaining why BTC are more valuable in China than they are elsewhere?  Why aren't they all the same price?
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:20:35
What would happen if, hypothetically, someone bought every single bitcoin in existence and just refused to do anything with them?
