Thanks! Hopefully this is just the beginning ;-)
 
If you'd like to use our bitcoin micropayment platform for your own content, go to PopChest.com and sign up for the beta. It's happening right now!

We're using  to distribute the video with bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:59:45
Hey Randy. Paste the address(es) that you sent to and we'll refund. BTW, if you have cookies unblocked you can refresh to watch at any time. Also, you can download the video from the button on the page to watch later.

Don't you just love having a public ledger :-) PM'd a direct download link. We're not whitelisted on Privacy Badger so that may be the issue. Appreciate you pointing it out. Thanks for watching. @_date: 2015-06-30 20:16:24
Cheers! The bitcoin micropayment tech is 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:36:49
1) It's early days, so we're experimenting with different payment levels &amp; percentages. When we're out of beta, expect our revenue share model with content creators to be exponentially better than YouTube…because Bitcoin!
 
2) re: advertising… Generally content creators give away 75% of advertising revenue (~45% to YouTube + ~30% to MCN). Imagine if you only got 1/4 of your paycheck every week. That's insane! Every direct bitcoin micropayment is worth orders of magnitude more than an ad impression for content creators.
 
Thanks for your interest. Check out  for a closer look at our bitcoin video distribution platform. Cheers!

PM'd :-)

Slash the seats! Thanks for watching. @_date: 2015-06-30 19:16:02
Yes, the beginning is a bit noisy. But it gets better. Thanks for watching! @_date: 2014-12-11 23:55:45
Well done! @_date: 2014-09-23 17:12:25
For this release, we wanted to raise awareness about what we're doing with information from the included .txt file. Direct streaming is something we're keeping an eye on for the future.
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:18:58
When I was making the video I asked myself the same question as because I couldn't find the symbol for the "Argentine peso"…turns out it's the $. Go figure.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:17:39
It is free. Use the bittorrent link to start downloading now.
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:54:59
Yes, we embedded it as a QR code at the end of the film as well as in the metadata of the .mp4 and included READ ME.txt file. But, you bring up a good point to include it on our site and YouTube channel. Thanks for the suggestion.
 
In the long run, that's going to be tough to figure out how to guarantee the address goes to the rightful place. We could use a PGP signature, but how many people are really going to check before they send funds? Also, although I find them very useful, I don't want to depend on a third-party shortener.
 
So, if anyone has suggestions…
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:41:26
Gold star! @_date: 2014-12-18 06:57:56
Well done. @_date: 2014-09-23 17:14:42
Hmmm... Visit our homepage at  to confirm. We just added our public address and QR to the splash page for added redundancy.
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:12:02
Nice writeup. Gold star! @_date: 2014-08-29 00:14:04
And to think those numbers only reflect the "official" exchange rate, not the real value on the street. Crazy.

Oh h no! Nothing to do with those people.

Thanks for sharing.
  
This is exactly why we're focusing on video now and not microblogging. People are quite used to paying for quality video (Netflix, HBO...). We believe injecting bitcoin makes the proposition better for viewers and more profitable for content creators.
  
And, hopefully we can also raise $500,000 to fund our development --

I work in the television industry in Los Angeles. On average, an hour long show has about 20 minutes of commercials. That's crazy. We think there's a better way. PopChest.com and it's bitcoin video delivery platform is the ultimate in a la carte media consumption.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:20:00
Love the enthusiasm! Hopefully this is just the beginning of many good things :-)
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:32:44
Sure thing ;-) Everyone could certainly use some comic relief right about now.
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:58:24
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:09:56
Interesting… We'll definitely look into this. Thanks for the feedback! @_date: 2015-07-14 17:07:46
Both :-) Pay with bitcoin and stream immediately. You have the option to download and watch later, DRM-free. Enjoy the show!

It's all Amazon Cloudfront so download speed shouldn't be an issue. Are you routing through a VPN? If so, check your provider.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:29:18
When you are bombarded with advertising, you are not getting something for free. You are the product. Bitcoin micropayments enable us to escape the "humans-as-commodity" system we have now. Try it and let me know what you think :-)
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:21:21
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:53:36
Absolutely! On July 14, visit  to stream/download the entire feature film for bitcoin :-)

We use BIP70 payment requests to minimize risk of over/under payment. Curious, what wallet are you using that didn't make the full payment?
 
I suppose if someone clearly made a mistake and overpaid, we'd just refund the difference. That's the great thing about having a public ledger…everyone can see what's happening :-)
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:27:53
Interesting. Please open a help ticket at 
 
We need to get to the bottom of this :-/
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:05:46
The only cookie we use is placed after purchase so we can mark that you've paid. That way if your browser crashes or if you want to watch the video later, you can come back and not have to pay again. We want to keep the user experience as "clean" as possible, so we're working on ways to make it even less intrusive. Cheers!
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:12:54
But would you rather pay the content creators or pay Google (YouTube advertising)? My hope is that more people would rather directly reward the ones making cool things rather than a mega corporation. We'll see :-)
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:34:34
Hello We received and are processing your request. As a startup, we are vetting our refund procedures so we are not mistakenly sending bitcoin without a solid process in place. Expect your help ticket to be closed today. Thanks for your patience.

I wouldn't call it stupidity at all. It's just an appreciation of human interaction. Our biology responds differently to different stimuli. Try calming a crying baby by playing super high-pitched, fast-tempo music…it's not going to happen. We want to use every possible tool at our disposal to create a positive outcome. In this case, it's for people to absorb what Andreas is saying and take his words to heart.
 
Great conversation. Thanks for watching :-) @_date: 2015-07-01 00:12:56
We need to provide an additional file format that is more compatible with Ubuntu/Firefox. Seems like simple H.264/mp4 causes problems from time to time -- 
 
We're improving!
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:54:44
Interesting. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:20:09
If you have cookie enabled, we mark that you have paid so you can come back for 48 hours. Otherwise, since we have this wonderful *public ledger*, send us the address you paid to and we can verify it on the blockchain before sending a download link.

I hear you, but the numbers are the numbers. Every bit of research suggests people mentally process $0.99 very differently than $1.00. So why fight gravity? Alas, thanks for watching.

Hi. Can you put a help ticket into  so we can address the problem? Thanks so much.

Thanks for making the effort to listen. Some of the testimony is pretty stunning.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:18:27
After having such an in-depth conversation with him, I was very impressed. Thanks for watching! @_date: 2015-03-17 00:20:53
After looking up the definition of tautology, I agree…hahaha!

We appreciate you working with us to get at the problem. And, thanks for watching! @_date: 2015-11-20 18:55:10
Probably just need the size up. The team there is super cool. Get in touch, I'm sure they'll sort you out.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:25:05
Thanks for your comment. Very helpful. I'd love to get your thoughts on viewing with and without commercials. Try again on us! @_date: 2015-03-09 20:55:40
I think the idea is to link your Circle account (or Coinbase, etc) to the HYPR. Then it creates a one-time credit card token for use at any Visa/MasterCard/AMEX terminal. You are free to, in effect, spend bitcoin anywhere credit and debit cards are accepted with zero fraud risk. Best of both worlds.
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:29:26

@_date: 2015-03-30 19:11:35
Got it. For this first test, we leaned towards "over-explaining" to help people understand this new way of doing micropayments. We'll work on streamlining the next iteration.

Hey everybody. At [TheProtocol.TV]( we really want to embody the spirit of bitcoin in everything we do. In the coming days, we will experiment with a purely peer-to-peer business model involving bitcoin micropayments for digital video content. We'll post on reddit when it happens. I hope you will join us on our journey to create a new media distribution paradigm with bitcoin :-)

Yes. You will be able to download and watch on any device at any time. Thanks!

We do videos related to the global decentralization movement, including Bitcoin and beyond.
 
Simply put, we think that traditional advertising drains your precious attention and rewards shareholders of companies like Google and Facebook rather than the content creators who are actually working to bring you something of value. We want to change that.

Question: If you watch an ad-supported video in the future, what would be the cause… Price (i.e. the video price is too high) or Convenience (i.e. you don't think ads are that big of a hassle)? If the answer is price, what would you be willing to pay for a half-hour program like the Draper interview?
 
Thanks for watching :-) @_date: 2015-03-20 19:42:54
Argh!!! I knew there was something I forgot to ask. Aside from that fail, the interview is an excellent deep dive into a lot of topics bitcoiners care about. I hope you enjoy the show and help us experiment with micropayments. Cheers!

I had a few reports of users unable to watch my initial post on my site (TheProtocol.TV), 5 days ago. So, I posted the video to YouTube today and resubmitted the link to reddit this morning. That post was removed. I thought maybe it was because I used the same title. So, I resubmitted again…which was also removed. I just sent a help request to the moderators.
