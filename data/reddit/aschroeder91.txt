no, i froze it with "yes" selected. 
it's a great 8 ball
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:22:21
My 8 ball said it'll drop to 952 then spike to 1882 in a 2 week stretch. 
It's a pretty solid 8 ball.

see the fine vertical line on the right picture?
That is looking at a past price. 
And coinbases "over the last month" view clips a little bit from the present so even though it looks pretty horizontal it recently went up.

I'm not predicting an impressive spike
I'm just predicting continued net growth

B) Dash?
Seems to grow the most when BTC drops
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:22:37
It's very likely Bitcoin's value will increase over the next year. 
**POLL:** Would you rather it spike now, or would you rather have one more chance to buy more low?^?
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:42:56
JeBalon... dont you get it? We all just wait for you to buy, then we all sell a bit.  We've been doing this for a while.

followed by a 51% decision that it was never sold to us?

Hey Coinbase is just HODLing

Blockchain is a mechanism for decentralized trust. Bitcoin adds the incentive (financial) to make the game theory work and keep this machine running.  It's true that this is an experiment and there definitely will be improvements. Whichever form this decentralized trust takes (Bitcoin or something similar) will be a jeanie that's very hard to put back in the bottle.  Decentralized trust is a technology that has massive power to shape a civilization with all its various applications. 
I hope through this lens Bitcoin looks different than the Harlem Shake.

Not the only way.  Help build the crypto economy. The more use cases cryptocurrencies have, the less they will need to be looked at through the lens of fiat. 
It's as easy as requesting acceptance of crypto
or as powerful as building a crypto friendly business. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:48:59
This is absolutely true; 
though, people often are mislead by the value of the word "can"
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:38:10
^^^ I opened the comment thread to make sure someone said this
No reason to assume bitcoin moving between addresses is a purchase, and absolutely no reason to assume it is an individual.

I would be interested in strategies to promote American mining companies. I know electricity costs are a limiting factor in us competing with China. Is that really such a big hurdle? Are there other more prominent variables preventing more American companies from establishing themselves?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:33:45
But then I would be utterly terrified if I misread any news saying "the mempool is empty"
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:44:31
more likely they just don't care...
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:08:09
I agree that wouldn't change much of anything. I'm more interested in why the economic environment isn't favoring this capitalist country from doing what we always do -- build a competitor. 
Apple wasn't controlled by the cellphone giants at the time (Motorola, etc), and it blossomed as an American run cellphone producer (albeit usually not made in America)
