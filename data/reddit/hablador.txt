They are choosing to lose money. This stupidity will last until they run out of money. Why they do this? Because they want to destroy Bitcoin so people will move to the altcoin they control: Bcash. At least this is their fuck up theory.
Obviously Bitcoin will last way longer than Antpool.

So the current boss of a criminal organisation which income is based on robbery declares that he is not a fan of an asset that cannot be robbed. Incredible...

Uber (like all merchants) has to pay Visa every time you use their credit card and obviously uber passes this cost to you via higher prices.

Fees are going down and also you could top-up your uber account with Bitcoins only once (for example 200$ every 6 months) and therefore, only pay only 1 fee. If you have only spent 100$ and you want to get the rest of your Bitcoins back you recover it and then you pay another fee. With this simple system you avoid paying fees every time you use uber and uber get paid in advance. Win-win

Miners should have less power no more. Bcash is an altcoin created by a miner with the goal of controling the currency.

- Buy things in other places.
- Buy less.
- Find alternatives.
- Buy in bulk (i.e consumers' co-operatives).

You have set a 50 sat/B fee. It's likely that your transaction will take long time to confirm.

Then just top-up 30$ or whatever you think you may use.

The best thing Uber can do for their business is to start accepting Bitcoins.

If Jihan decides to stop mining Bitcoins and start mining his new altcoin, there is absolutely now problem for Bitcoin: others will take his place. Bitcoin existed before Jihan and will continue to grow without him.

Yes, yes, waiting for the secret weapon victory was a very successful strategy for the Germans in WWII.

On the first of august it's going to be fun to watch thousands of people dumping their bitcoin cash (BCC) in a race to get some money before BCC gets to 0. My guess is that it will take 24 hours for BCC to reach the bottom, at the end it will depend on how much money the Chinese want to lose to maintain the price for a couple of hours.

BCC is not Bitcoin. BCC stands for "Bitmain: Chinese Con".

Actually price stability helps bitcoin because promotes the use of BTC as a currency for buying and selling products.
