Why have you removed latest tweet where you said new guarantor accepted by Nasdaq? And who is the new guarantor?

Phoenix is bitcoin.
The legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again. Just like bitcoin has died over hundred times.

Is this founder using kncminers centers?
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:20:50
Maybe they haven't paid electricity bill :D This whole kncminer situation is very weird. Halving can't be reason for their bankruptcy, because everybody knows that it going to happen. Do you know what is kncminers hw ghs/watt rate for their newest devices? 
@_date: 2016-06-30 07:12:45
Can someone explain how this is different than XBT Provider's Bitcoin ETN?

I promise to sell all of my stocks in this week. I will purchase more land and stuff what I need for the future including bitcoins.

There is three ways that procentual fee amount of reward could rise. One is that there is more tx in blocks after segwit and other updates, second is that blocks are temporarily full and people have to use higher fees to prioritize their transactions and third is what actually happen week ago I mean the reward halving. I am pretty sure that there is thousands of miners who have not realize yet that fee is now much more bigger role in miners reward. People moving back to pools which share the tx fee and large Chinese pool's hashing power will decrease or they will change their rewarding policy.

We Europeans should put end for this EU project and take the power back to people. Nowadays it try to control everything and it was not what people think when they voting for joining the Union.

I would say that price would fall. Someone have to stop mining if they don't want to do that out of pocket operation and it is impossible do for longer period at least in the bigger scale. If someone bigger player stop the game and triggers bigger sale turnover it will lead to that mining revenue will collapse. And if it collapse somebody have sell more bitcoins to cover hw and maintenance bills when they stop the game. It could be like domino effect. There is players who HODLR last months so this is like club 600USD game who sell there could be a winner.  Remember that price goes down more quickly than new investments coming for mining industry. For this revenue there is no point for get new miners when ROI is impossible to reach. Hash rate won't go down because there is places where electricity cost only 0.01-0.02USD/kwh so old hw goes there and it won't help miners situation ether. I hope that I am wrong, but I see that scenario possible.

3.6% at the moment. 1/3 are over 13btc. Antpool and F2Pool keep miner fees themselves, have high pool fee and even send everyday reward share with fee. 
I am pretty sure that fees going higher than 1.25btc per reward in next months.
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:11:30
If bitcoin price goes down -20% -30% then it could collapse whole mining industry for a while. I would say that 600USD is very important support level and I hope it will last, because after that major players have to sell too.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:16:50
Bitcoin price can go quickly down with hash rate. When people stop mining they could sell their bitcoins to cover hw and electricity losses. When price goes down more and more miners stop mining and it is like domino effect. This one scenario.
@_date: 2016-07-19 11:26:54
Yes. I know that. That's why tx fee is now double 5-10% and last reward (25) it was like 2,5-5% and that is major change for the miners.
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:43:55
Yes I understand that higher fees will have negative effect for small payments and sometimes there is no point even send small amount because of the fee. 
Example they who are mining in example in Antpool should check that if they are rewarded like everyday small amount that they dont are waste too much for the fee when pool sending reward share to miners. Like if your hashpower is 10Ths and pool send 0.01BTC to your address everyday and fee is 0.001 that is 10% of all incomes + reward tx fees + pool fee what you dont get compared to pools which give fees to miners and send reward share without fee (miner higher priority).
@_date: 2016-07-19 09:21:07
Antpool and F2Pool kept fees by the pool. So wondering who is still mining there because fee is over 10% of reward today. So miners losing 10%+pool fee+tx fee to miners if they are using those pools.
@_date: 2016-07-28 10:41:05
Fees are now over 4% of the reward. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:40:31
I think we have to understand that there is periods now and near future that blocks are "full". There is people who operate in markets and trading and they want that their tx go throught asap and they are willing to pay for that. That group is sending bigger and bigger amounts of bitcoins everyday. That amount is already much more bigger role in transacted amounts of coins than bitcoin's customers small payments business. People who are willing to pay bigger fee will dominate payment network so long that there is no limits in txs which could cause lag for confirmation time. I believe that bitcoins price and also tx fees going to rise. Tx fees going to rise at least couple of years, because more and more different kind of users coming to arena which will give high priority for high tx fee. My forecast is that bigger tx amounts of coins are in the bigger role in the near future. LN or someting similar could change the situation someday.
@_date: 2016-07-19 13:02:19
Yes 20BTC and 0.02BTC are in the same priority when you using the same fee amount example 0.001BTC. But when you sending bigger amounts you propably using bigger fee if you want that tx goes through asap. Sometimes there is no even point to send 0.02BTC with current fee. What I tried to say there is more and more people who sending bigger amounts (like traders) and if blocks are "full" they propably using bigger fees which will increase the lag time for smaller payments.

I pay 0.05€/kwh overall and using miners for heating purpose where I can't use heat pump so miners are profitable like forever :)
