No, but [close](

Had the same question, googled it and [this]( is what came up. Looks pretty neat
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:19:57
That makes sense, thank you!

Link to that paper?

So essentially it would "move" my wallet. If I logged in on my iPad it would log out of my iPhone?

I know enough to know what he was saying was either a fixed problem or just straight up incorrect, but I do not know enough yet to be able to point out what exactly the flaws were.

He was just talking about the exponential growth in size of the blockchain

That's not an offense, it's a legitimate question. I saw it but I wanted to get more info

I do not know if I like the "always on" camera. Not so much that I could see myself scanning a BTC code I do not want to by mistake, but more so I have a concern with battery impact

I see what you are saying, but the camera is one of the things if not the thing that uses up the most power. I prefer to push a button to activate the camera to scan codes

Yea I want one not to use all the time but to have the option if I need to
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:17:42
How secure is that?

It means that the entire network is going to be slow for everyone, this happens from time to time. If you don’t like it, try Litecoin ;)

Yea that's why I'm thinking step one would be to get a group going in my area and then make the main objective to be putting an ATM in the mall.

I really started to like the Xapo card, but they won't ship in U.S.

I want to say maybe 2-3 sentences about it, just so there will be no "but what's so wrong with the dollars I have now." No pain=No Change. I'll use an explanation of why the declination of the dollar negatively affects businesses as a transition back to the "why"
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:48:07
I really like your explanations, both on what to focus on for the presentation and the explanations from links you provided. I do have one question I would ask, since I am not in a policy class (I am in a business class) I do not want to delve too far into federal reserve shenanigans, however I think it might be good to touch on it, just to give a better understanding of why the dollar (in my opinion) would not be a long term solution for sustainability.
