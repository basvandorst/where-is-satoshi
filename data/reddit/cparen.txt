I hate to be negative, because there is some amount of novelty in the alleged/hypothesized events. However, the general category of "take investor money but lie about how it was lost" is [not exactly new] ( What do you think makes this case novel?

Could be an immediate injunction to prevent further losses. Right now, they could run daily losses until there's nothing left with (possibly) no consequences. If they violate a court injunction, they risk jail time.
But that's just my speculation. What kind of precident is there for this sort of theft?

I too am skeptical, so keep that in mind when I say this but -- say you're in digital forensics and have been approached to do this investigation.

A currency that at various times was [accepted online by hitmen] ( I'm guessing you might appreciate the thieves not knowing who you are.

They don't have to. Regulations can require measures to limit the funds exposed in breaches, require measures to shut down breaches when they occur, require insurance against loss from such events, require internal auditing to aid investigation after the fact, etc. 
All this can reduce financial impact of a breach.

Suppose you go to the bank to withdraw some fund from your account. They tell you they can't; they ran out of mony. You ask what happened. Bank says "oh, teller  gave all your money to someone pretending to be you." Do you blame the identity thief, or also hold the bank responsible?

You raise a valid point though (intentionally?). What if there were *two* such metals, and neither could be converted into the other. And what if they fluctuated in value relative to each other -- maybe some days, there are more people selling metal A and less B, driving exchange in favor of B's value. Or would that end up being to inconvenient, with the market eventually deciding on some fixed rate of exchange between A and B?

20% of zero is zero. If businessX sells you a widget for 1BTC when the exchange rate is 1BTC to 700USD, then immediately trades it for 700USD, their capital gain is 700-700=0. 20% of zero is zero. No additional tax would apply.

Identical to an electric heater of equal wattage. Heaters generally come in higher wattage though (eg 1000w is a beefy pc power supply, but considered small for a space heater)


In theory, combining enough bitcoin miners and a thermostat would produce a sufficient space heater. You'd need at least two r9 290x gpus, probably closer to four, to produce sufficient heat to replace the current heater.

Interesting, because the sticking point for me is that bitcoin (the original paper) is very sound except for lacking an objective reason to believe a given chain. The essential difference between different altcoins, apart from the slightly different parameters chosen, is that they are based on a different initial chain node. There's even a separate "test" chain for bitcoin -- what makes that "not money" and the normal chain "is money"?
Right now, it comes down to subjective confidence; the primary bitcoin chain is "money" because its participants in aggregate have decided to declare it to be money. It differs from "fiat currency" only in the nature of who is declaring it to be currency.
I'm curious, has there has been much said on this aspect of bitcoin? I'd like to be better educated on the economic theory and philosophy here.

@_date: 2014-12-11 15:50:22


Probably just a legal thing. IIRC, US law (or maybe just executive branch policies?) is funny about where bitcoins are coming from. If in the US and associated with a US identity (e.g. XBox account) then my understanding is that the process is smooth and you just declare capital gains and go home with your money. Otherwise, I'm understanding that you gotta collect a whole bunch of info that bitcoin users probably aren't really interested in sharing. Otherwise, the gov't could come any day and seize everything on some weird and vague anti-terrorism or anti-drug law. And companies don't really like having their money seized and tied of up months/years.
So when you see "only in the US", it's generally because of US or international law.

@_date: 2014-03-11 02:12:26
Yes. 
That's why "123456" is incredibly common password, but less common as a username. In Shannon's original paper on the matter, this relates to the actual entropy of a channel vs its maximum possible entropy. "password" is high entropy when appearing in a  base64 encoded sha1 hash -- the sha1 hash is supposedly unbiased, so is unlikely to choose "password" over any other 8 character sequence. 
Same language, but different channel.

Correct. You'd have wallet-based recovery emails instead.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:18:13
I don't think that's how capital gains works. At most, you can offset losses to reduce your tax liability, but only down to zero.
Also, in an audit, they could require your public keys to prove the losses against historic market values. And fraud caries heavy penalties, like jail time, no? Why risk?
If anything, it seems like a good way to diversify. I would suspect that bitcoin value varies inversely with conventional financial investments. Gains in one can offset losses in the other.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:30:48
And they can only do so because, should someone come and withdraw that $90 in notes, they're covered. Otherwise it would be fraud.

The source is Verilog/VHDL, which as mentioned is like a high level language, but for hardware.
The result of that is a wire net document, specifying every logic gate and the wires that connect them.
The result of *that* is a set of wire routing maps -- i think grandparent post called this a floorplan. It says where to put all of the logic gates and wires so that none of the wires or gates short out.

Not necessarily. They could offer an altcoin where 1) they assign a large sum to themselves in the initial block, 2) operate an exchange with a fixed conversion between their coin and other assets, centrally establishing a baseline *value* only, and 3) offer conventional mining rewards as an alternative to managing their own central infrastructure.
I don't think they would, but any financial institution could do this to offer users an alternative to credit/debt cards and cash.

Around the Windows Vista time, Microsoft briefly introduced [CardSpace]( No one used that either. I'm sure there are a hundred other similar public-key authentication schemes inbetween. No one uses them.
If bitcoin takes off, then you'll have public-key authentication that is *already deployed*, that everyone is using. It would have conquered the one, immense hurdle any tech needs to conquer before it can replace passwords.

So am I, so take what I say with some skepticism. :-) 


Of course you can. Draw up a contract that says Alice will give Bob 1btc -- in exchange, Bob will give Alice 1.02 btc next month.
Bob is in trouble if btc deflates immensely, so perhaps he buys deflation insurance. For 0.01 btc, the insurer gives bob the option of buying 1.02 bitcoin next month at this month's deflation adjusted value by some metric.
(Ok, the insurance would be massively more expensive today, but that's due to btc volatility. If deflation was stable, the insurer might find they expect to lose up to 0.005 btc due to deflation from the offer they make to Bob, thus making a net profit)


Deflation traps, not inflation. Inflation makes it *easier* to pay back debt over time. Do you mean inflation to drive up prices, driving people into debt, followed by deflationary periods to trap them? Tightening the money supply would have a temporary deflationary effect, right?

Because the author "felt like it". It's arbitrary.


I can't speak for everyone, but I've got a day job with predictable rewards. Entry level programming jobs have a higher expected return than starting a cryptocurrency.


Eh, sort of. I can open notepad and type some words, then sell it to a publisher or publish on Lulu. It's like free money! Well, sort of.
It's worth something if you can convince people it's worth something.


Because the math is hard. Very hard. It requires reversing some numerical puzzles called "cryptographic hashes". Reversing those would be front page news (at least, in netsec newspapers). It happens every once in a while, like every decade or two. The cryptocurrency will probably change which puzzles they use before they were broken.


It's trying to solve some simpler numeric puzzles. These puzzles are designed to be hard to solve (not too hard), but easy to check the solution. So hard, that the only known ways to solve them is to just guess for a long time until you find an answer. The hardness is picked so that, on average, only one new solution is found worldwide every 10 minutes or so.
This is called a "proof of work". 
The concept is that it's so hard, it's unlikely that someone has enough compute resources privately to keep up with the rest of the world. To cheat, you'd have to outrun everyone else.
Bitcoin miners only use the longest chain. Computing a new block is hard, but when you do, that block says you have some free money. But now they need to convince everyone to use this block. Of course, since this new block creates a longer chain, everyone else wants to use it.
Why do they want my chain? Well, being one longer than the rest, it means that if they solve a puzzle on this new chain, their chain will then be the new longest chain, so they'll be able to convince people to use it.
Basically, you get free money by getting people to believe you have free money, but they'll only be convinced if you follow the rules of (a) solving a hard puzzle, (b) using the current longest chain, and (c) only assigning yourself the pre-agreed upon amount of money. 
The exact puzzle, chain, and pre-agreed amount differs between different altcoin, is pretty arbitrary ways. Each altcoin (including bitcoin) exists only because some non-zero set of people agree to keep going with it.

Could you create derivatives that have backing on the block chain via multi-party protocols? E.g. loan out some number of bitcoin, while permitting forcible recall of those coin within a certain number of block transactions after the loan recall is requested? Then a banking entity could hold on to bitcoin and even "spend" them, but there would effectively be a lien against those coins that would be carried through each transaction.

You could certainly support multiple hierarchical chains with corresponding increases it block latency. It would simply take time to move from one chain to a parent, then back down again. This could also address the present limitations in transaction volume, by dividing load amongst various chains.
And it you did a lot of business with Mars and Earth, then you'd keep coin distributed between both chains so you can always spend immediately.

It's an interesting intellectual curiosity that this theory only works so long as it can't be proven objectively. It the coins provably can't be spent, then they're not really bitcoin any longer. They're functionally equivalent to me writing a post-it claiming I own that many bitcoin; neither can be spent.
Perhaps Satoshi just really liked paradoxes.

Suppose I have some wallet (A0) with 13 mBTC, and want to buy a pizza for 12 mBTC. I send 12 to the pizza company's single-use address (A1), and 1 back to myself in a new wallet (A2). The pizza company know links A1 to my home address where they delivered the pizza, but that's it right?
Unfortunately, later I give you that 1 mBTC (to A3), and you spend it (A3) on a pizza too (to A4). Oops, you just compromised my identity.
See, the pizza company has your home address associated with A3, A3 is on the global chain associated in a transaction with A2, and A2 was in the transaction with A1, which is already associated with me.
It's not particularly anonymous if a 3rd party can link our identities dealing business with us individually, even if it's only partial knowledge, unless that probability is vanishingly small.
In contrast, with zerocoin, I'd trade in 12 mBTC (wallet A0) for 12 separate mZC (Z0 thru Z11). I'd transfer Z0 thru Z11 to the pizza company (A1). You'd do the same (from A2, to Z12-Z23, then to A3). 
The pizza company then looks at the blockchain, and ... it can only determine that it was the first to cash in Z0-Z23 to A1 and A3 respectively. It can't determine who minted the coin. It can associate my identity with Z0, but it can't associate Z0 with *anything else*. Likewise with Z12 associated with you but nothing else. 
The only link between you and me is that we appear on the global chain as having minted zero coin, but it doesn't say *which* zero coin. In fact, even if we loose our phones revealing A0 and A2 belonging to me and you respectively, the pizza company can't even figure out whose wallets sourced which zerocoin. 
At least, that's as far as I understand it. Perhaps I'm mistaken.

If I understand correctly, there's nothing stopping a mining node from picking up all those transactions at once, if lucrative enough. Creating a mining patch that takes into account the daughter fees should be fairly straightforward, having done that sort of tree optimization in software before.

- In bitcoin, they tell you up front that you're paying out earlier investors.

- With bitocin, they show you the ledger and it uses strong crypto to prevent falsification.

The market will provide. Suppose deflation was a steady 5%. Instead, a bank can turn a decent profit by simply requiring you pay them back. 0% interest is 5% return for them.

Likewise "You say it's not a pyramid scheme, but I see it grows exponentially, gives later investors money directly to earlier investors, and isn't backed by any tangible asset. Sure looks like a pyramid scheme". But you reply "ah, but there's an important difference. It uses an open ledger that anyone can verify rather than cooked books; it can be used without fraud".

This is another straw man. If QR based, you would scan the QR code, the device would ask you something like:

    [ ] "Authentication wallet" - 0 mBTC balance
    [ ] "My spending cash" - estimated 20 mBTC balance
    [ ] New anonymous wallet
    [ ] Cancel

This seems to also reveal aspects of my internal finances to the payee. Like you said, it still necessitates mixing to preserve privacy.
E.g. If I sell widgets at 1 mBTC, and there are two raw material suppliers -- one sells at 7 BTC per pallet, and another at 13 BTC for 2 pallets -- you can discover my supplier. You just wait until one day you see a transaction record with 210000 sources of 1 mBTC each -- including yours -- and one spend of 236 BTC, infering that I buy 30 pallets from the first supplier and 4 from the second.
I *really* don't want to be revealing who my material suppliers are and what the mix ratios are to individual customers.
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:07:36


Correct. The logic answer would be exactly 1. Then we'd easily be able to compare the number of bitcoin to the total potential supply.
If there's any logic at all, it's psychology. Maybe the author felt 100 billion would be a more appealing number to folks, or result in coin quantities that are easier for folks to reason about. A crypto coin with close to 1 coin = 1 usd exchange rate will be easier for Americans to work out the math for; similar for other currencies. 




If the puzzles aren't there, the chain would grow too fast, making it hard for any one user to convince others to use their chain. If they can't convince others to use it, they won't participate. If too few people are participating in mining, it becomes easy to cheat. If it's easy to cheat, people won't want to use it as currency, because it will be impossible to know for certain if you *really* received funds from someone. You can't exchange it for anything else, because the person you would possibly exchange with can never be certain that they've received coin from you -- you could always go and spend it again, and have a decent chance at succeeding.
The math puzzles make longer chains a scarce item, which makes them valuable for mining, which leads lots of people to mine them. Lots of people mining independently makes it hard to outrun, which makes cheating exceptionally hard (hopefully too hard to be practical).

I doubt it was a "deal", but I wouldn't disagree with you.

You're assuming market price would be cheaper perpetual. Once purchased, each rig provides an ongoing return. A one time purchase wouldn't yield ongoing returns.

This is pretty clearly headline-bait. The article doesn't discuss bitcoin whatsoever.
As for the implications, IANAL, but I don't see how this would apply to blockchain events. Stock purchases and trades are of non-fungible assets. If you're trading bitcoin for or into USD in the US, then the law might apply. If you're mining, then you're merely recording someone else's transaction, and recieving payment for that service. If you go to a notary to notarize a stock sale, the notary doesn't pay a FTT tax. Blockchain transactions are more like notary transactions than stock trade transactions.
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but at the very least cite something that suggests FTT would apply before jumping to conclusions.

You could rent towards ownership. That's effectively how a 30yr mortgage worked traditionally.
The problem would be finding an investor. Suppose they buy the house for you for 1 BTC. 25 yr later when you're ready to buy, the house may be worth only 0.75 BTC - the house didn't lose value, the currency *gained* value. So that investor needs to have charged you an extra .01 BTC per year to cover losses from deflation, in addition to normal rent.

So in a sense, you only pay capital gains on the discount you got on the coffee. You payed $4 for a $4.40 cup of coffee, and the gov't wants to tax the $0.40 cents you saved. (I'm not defending the tax... just trying to make sure I'm understanding exactly which part of which $'s are being taxed).

"Hard fork" and "soft fork" refers to what happens to the miners that don't update their software, no matter which proposed change you're talking about. The difference is in how outdated miners will treat blocks computed by updated miners. 
In a soft fork change with new transactions types: outdated miners will *accept* valid blocks from updated miners. They'll also accept some *invalid* transactions or blocks from adversaries. As a consequence of the second fact, new miners will *reject* some newly computed blocks coming from outdated miners when it contains invalid transactions. Both of these risks can be mitigated somewhat by designing the new transaction types to not activate until you detect that the majority of miners have updated their software.
In a hard fork change with no change to transaction types: outdated miners will *reject* valid blocks from updated miners, while updated miners will *accept* blocks from outdated miners. Apart from newly mined coins, both old and new miners will agree about transaction validity though.
Classic is a hard fork change. Even if core were to support and implement classic, it would be a hard fork by definition.

That's not how economics works. Lets apply it to a sports stadium.
"The sports stadium will constantly want to accept these *customers only willing to pay $1 for a seat* as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of *sports stadiums where all seats are $1 to gradually increase*"
The problem with this statement is that no one would buy a $50 ticket to a sports game if they knew they could just line up early and get a $1 unsold seat. Instead, the stadium leaves the unsold seats empty.
Likewise, someone unwilling to pay miner fees will go to the low-priced miner with their transaction. Of course, if they do this, the transaction might take hours to clear instead of minutes. If high-priced miners also accepted the low-priced transaction bids, then there'd be no incentive for customers to pay higher transaction fees -- everyone could just 'wait for the last minute' and get the low-priced unsold slots in the high-priced miner's transactions.
This is why, as a miner or operator of a mining pool, you set a minimum transaction fee formula, and you stick to it.

This block chain is near its capacity limit. Most "doing things with this technology" require available capacity. 
The other aspect here is that the capacity problem appears to be a proxy for the larger question of how bitcoin evolves technically, which impacts whose industry plans can succeed and which become impossible.

It's possible that the outcome of the capacity issue will be used as a precedent for how future conflicts are resolved.

My experience has been when you have strongly competing proposals, that generally most developers just want *something* to win decisively so they can start building on it. The debate, while valuable and necessary, delays short term progress. E.g. in this case, the short term loss of confidence in btc due to transaction backlogs, a direct consequence of delays in addressing the block size issue.

Out of curiousity, do you know what in what rough ballpark is the number of hash units per chip. A high end GPU today has something like 4K shader units, but a shader unit is a lot closer to a full CPU than it is a functional block. I'm curious how simple the hash units are in these ASICs chips. 
Based on performance along, I'd estimate somewhere on the order of 100K~500K hash units per chip. I'm curious if any chips publish this number.

I don't get why the linked proposal is called "nofork". It requires forking the bitcoin protocol in order to secure the btcA &lt;-&gt; btcB exchanges, in order to produce a zero sum.

@_date: 2016-01-27 18:32:16
There's a couple of aspects here, some which were already mentioned, but I can try to roll it all up into a short reply:
1\) Yes, it's inefficient. The blockchain is, I guess, [53 GB]( and growing still. It will only get bigger as time goes on.
2\) You rarely need the entire chain. The blockchain uses a Merkle tree to store its history, which allows you to verify certain things without the whole history. 
Think of it like a choose your own adventure book that only has pages 1, 3, and 10 -- page 1: "if you want to fight the dragon, go to page 3, if you want to fight the wizard, page 4." There's still one whole adventure there to read. If someone pays you money, and you want to verify that transaction (e.g. "the wizard" in this analogy), you could potentially ask them for the precise missing pages, instead of the whole book. 
3\) If there's a miner you trust to be honest, you don't need any of the chain. You can author transactions to spend your money, or create wallets to accept money, without looking at the bitcoin chain. You can send transactions to a miner and they can tell you if they think the transaction is valid. 
For small amounts (e.g. a personal wallet for small, day to day expenses) I'm probably OK with the risk that my money might get stolen (like I am with a physical wallet) in exchange for the convenience, and given that the amount in the wallet is small. This is especially true if I verify the transactions with a large bitcoin payment provider -- because I know their reputation for honesty is worth more to them than the chance to steal 0.2 btc from me.
4\) As others have noted, there are proposals for "sidechains". These are basically alternate cryptocurrency with a fixed exchange rate with btc. If I'm on one sidechain, I only ever need to validate that sidechain, and can ignore other sidechain that I don't have any wallets for.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:54:47


Yes, that's what I mean. It's misleading to call it "no-fork" if you can't convert btcA-&gt;btc without a soft-fork of the btc chain. 
It's either an altcoin (if you can't convert back; so value can vary) or its a hard fork (converts both ways, but only works if the majority of btc minering power accept it)
Also, I don't think a soft fork will work. Wouldn't a forked client *reject* blocks authored by an unforked node if they didn't validate under the new btcA protocols?
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:43:29
I have to admit I don't follow bitcoin closely enough to recognize all of those names, but if I can grossly summarize, you've got an early adopter technology in which:
- Two companies growing and failing way too fast, based only on the new technology,
- Infighting between different technical factions based on the new technology
- Companies failing to deliver products on time, or at all (vaporware).
This sounds like just about every new tech sector -- complete with vendor incompatibility (the competing block size increase proposals). Perhaps every new opportunity bring out a sample of both the best and the worst, and we sometimes only notice the worst.

Even supposing your hypothetical scenario, a Pentium III PC is going to need about [22 PIIIs]( just to have the same vote as a single FX-8320E, at least relative to that one benchmark. 
Unless you mean that all computers, no matter how powerful, somehow take the same time to compute PoW hashes. In which case, miners would buy up 100s of PIIIs and other (cheaper) chips, and out compute your i3 or i5 cpu. 
No matter what the hypothesis, those with more capital get a greater fraction of the vote in bitcoin. The original paper acknowledged this.


Actually, it said those with a large amount of (centralized, but still minority) mining power have it in their best interest to keep the value of btc stable or growing, since they get paid in btc. 


Just my assessment, so take it for what it's worth: they *need* to pay back their sunk costs. From a business perspective, their only move would be to remain on the old chain. Even if the value of bitcoin tanks, they still come out further ahead than if they stop mining.
Give them a proper incentive to switch over and my bet is that they would in a heartbeat. "Softfork" proposals allow Chinese miners to remain profitable, relying on other nodes outside of the GFoC to perform the necessary validation.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:53:19
Here's a modest proposal (albeit an expensive one, since you need some programmers for it):
- Implement a fork of the mining software with *all* the proposals with significant traction.
- In this fork, if a chain fails validation, check if it validates under one of the above proposals. 
- If it does, *turn on said protocol* for computing new blocks. 
- If possible, code any newly computed blocks to advertise support for ALL the proposals. (E.g. some proposals only activate when 75% of recently computed blocks indicate support).
This would be fixing the split vote. You know, how if two A party canidates run and one B party, you can end up with 30-30-40% vote, such that 60% voted A, but B wins? In this case, "B" is "do nothing". 
If you want "something" to happen, where something is any of the rational block size increases, then you'd run this fork which effectively votes for all the A party candidates. Avoids the "40% vote classic, 40% vote XT, 20% vote no change", resulting in no protocol reaching 75% acceptance needed to switch over.
Alternatively, if you don't want change, then don't do anything. Running the existing core fork is effectively a vote against change.

This seems to be written from the perspective of TeamShelter. That's not a criticism, I think TeamShelter has some excellent ideas. I honestly don't understand why TeamWater seems so opposed.

Follow up question to those answering this question (excellent answers, everyone!):
Instead of increasing blocksize, is there the possibility of fragmenting the network? This scale problem exists in content distribution networks too. The solution there is to break up the world into regions, and lazily propagate information between regions.
What would this look like for bitcoin? Perhaps it would mean extending to secondary block-chains. Need more capacity? Add more secondary chains. BTC in secondary chains would require a special transaction on the main chain that transfers those coins to a bitcoin address on that secondary chain; and likewise in the opposite direction. Moving between secondary chains would require first transferring back to the primary chain.
This would allow bitcoin to scale out horizontally, without the implications of a change in block size.
I'm curious if there are any proposals in this general style?
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:14:29

Yes, and how do the coin come *out* of the black hole on the main chain, such that (1) existing miners will recognize it as valid, and (2) only the author of the btcA-&gt;btc transaction on the btcA sidechain can claim them? 




This could possibly work, if you trust the sidechain miners. But if the majority of minors one day decided to defect, they could claim all the current btc -&gt; btcA coins on the btc chain and run off with them. 


I haven't seen the proposal yet. Important details are missing (see above questions)

It seems like soft forks carry an inverse risk: a miner on the old protocol will potentially accept an invalid transaction (e.g. one of the "pay to anyone" coin that isn't really theirs) silently. I'd think a vendor would rather a transaction be rejected erroneously and use a different payment device with that customer, rather than having "bounced checks" where they get robbed.
Am I misunderstanding the risks in a soft fork?

A mined block is a proof of work that is cryptographically linked to a set of bitcoin transactions that make up that block. The more transactions, the larger the block.
As a miner, you always want the most recent block to work off of, and once mined, you want everyone to use your block as the basis for mining the next one. That's how you make money.
The larger the block size, the more network bandwidth you need (cost), but also the more transactions you could potentially fit in a block (profit).

@_date: 2016-01-29 23:19:33
But isn't that why soft-fork folks prefer a soft-fork -- that is repurposes PoW as a way of voting for new rules? 
E.g. if the majority of miners stick with the old protocol, you can author new-protocol transactions, but they won't be safe. Someone random can come along and claim those coins, and old-protocol miners will accept those transactions and, by definition of being a soft fork, new miners will also accept those transactions.
My understanding is that all the soft-fork proposals require a super-majority of miners indicate support for the fork before anyone authors new-protocol transactions, precisely to avoid this situation. But again, the new-protocol is using PoW as the mean of detecting votes for implementing the new protocol.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:12:33
Technically, yes, the miners have the power, since btc is only usable as currency while they continue to operate and agree on the btc algorithm/protocol. And for them, block size is a liability (reward is constant; internet bandwidth costs increase with block size)
However, politically, none of this exists in a vacuum. Miners get paid in btc, so their reward is proportional to the utility of btc. And, very recently, block size limits started hurting the value of btc due to speculation of insufficient transaction throughput. In a sense, the currency exchanges and traders, collectively, have told the miners just recently that they will pay the miners more fiat in exchange for larger block size.
In this respect, the market has indirect ability to influence miners via increasing or decreasing the value of btc.

You make an excellent point, save here:


The condition is slightly weaker. If the lowered value due fork is less than the loss in value due to lack of trust in transaction capacity, miners might choose the fork to minimize losses. 
Of course, this all neglects the bandwidth concerns as well. No economically rational miner would support a fork, no matter how substantial the consensus, if it means they'll become insolvent (e.g. if they don't have bandwidth necessary to operate mining nodes effectively).

Depends on the hash power. But pre-segwit nodes will consider post-segwit blocks valid, so for pre-segwit nodes it's just a question of which chain is longer. As long as the post-segwit chain eventually grows faster, then it will always displace segwit coins spent as "anyone" when the pre-segwit nodes accept the post-segwit chain.

Anyone-can-spend transactions will be accepted as valid by both nodes running the new segwit code and old pre-segwit cold. Attempts to spend segwit transactions by anyone else will only be accepted by pre-segwit code nodes, and rejected by nodes running the new segwit code, creating a temporary split until the segwit nodes outmine the pre-segwit code nodes. Once they outmine them, the pre-segwit nodes will naturally accept the chain that rejected the transaction.

I believe proponents would argue not for safety, but trading faster turn around and lower fees for more centralized/localized security. There's not room in a bitcoin block for 3000 cups of coffee. And with the reward split in June, miners are looking at taking an average loss of 8mbtc per transaction, or about $3.33 less per transaction. Are you willing to pay a $3.33 transaction fee?
On the other hand, assuming OP's numbers are correct, you could make up the difference with a $0.12 fee per cup of joe. That's a more palatable number. You might even risk a few hundred mbtc on such a tech, if it could save you 8mbtc per transaction.
At least, that's how I understand the argument.

If bitcoin was the bottleneck, then the fee would have to be 1x - OP noted "assuming bitcoin was the bottleneck". If so, then they wouldn't have spent 3000 transactions on the bitcoin blockchain because there wouldn't have been enough bandwidth, so there aren't 2989 lost opportunities here.

@_date: 2016-02-17 00:26:03


Rather, they'd be turning on and off chips every day.
A miner motivated by economic concerns alone would compute the average operating cost (read: price of electricity) per block mined (read: your fraction of total mining compute power), and only run their miner whenever the queued transactions + block reward exceeded the *current* bitcoin fiat value. Otherwise, even if you do mine a block, you'll spend more on power (on average) than just buying BTC on the open market. 
For example, with some round numbers, suppose you owned 1% of the total mining power in the world, you'd expect to mine a block every T = 16.6 hours, and assume this 1% rig consumes Pc = USD$638 / hr in electricity. Current bitcoin trade value is V = USD$407.47. That means you spend T × Pc per block, and your income is (25 + F) × V per block. If you want to turn a gross profit, you'll only  do so when income exceeds cost, that is, when 
    (25 + F) × V &gt; (T × Pc)
or in terms of fee, when
    F &gt; (T × Pc) / V - 25
Whenever this isn't true (either because electricity costs went up, or because there the transaction fees are not high enough), you'll turn off your rig and take that T × Pc dollars and buy BTC on the open market, because it'll be cheaper.

I don't follow how this allows customers to transfer currency to vendor in exchange for goods and services. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:08:00
Perhaps one example to illustrate. Suppose you find a particular program in this language that takes 30 seconds to run. An attacker could use this to give themselves a mining difficulty advantage.
1) Attacker crafts a bunch of such programs, submits them as transactions, adding reasonably good fees.
2) Normal miners pick up these transactions since the fees look good, start spending time verifying the transaction, 30 seconds a piece. This could easily add up to many minutes.
3) Attacker runs a mining node as well, but their node knows to ignore these poorly behaved transaction. This gives their node a head start on verifying transactions to be included in the next block, allowing them to mine more efficiently.
Edit-add, more clarification:
The problem is that a miner can't tell up front how expensive the program will be to verify. Even very small programs can have [very long runtimes]( and some long programs (well behaved smart contracts) are quick to verify (few loops).
One alternative is a language that provides estimates or time bounds on computation. Miners can then prioritize effectively, e.g. requiring fees that are in part proportional to the verification cost, or terminate transactions that exceed their estimated runtimes. This incentivizes applications built on bitcoin to use programs that are efficient to verify.
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:23:37
Interesting perspective. Of course, the more valuable bitcoin becomes, the higher the difficulty will rise as commercial interests compete for block rewards and/or fees. That's an interesting possible outcome to consider though - thanks!

@_date: 2017-04-20 00:16:37
I'm not an expert in the area, but as I understand it:
Rather than have miners run the smart contract program, the user runs it and the contract program produces a witness value. This value is crypto-hard to forge, and cheap to verify. The actual contract program the miner runs only verifies the witness.
Bounded loops mean miners can predict execution cost, which means they're more likely to accept your transaction. E.g. if I ask you to carry in my groceries for a fee, you'll want to know how many groceries I have -- one bag? A semi truck trailer full? Turing complete means I tell you "I dunno, start carrying my groceries and see how long it takes". Bounded computations are more like "I have between 2 to 4 bags" so you'll accept the fee as long as it's reasonable for up to 4 bags.

The current fee story is a UI nightmare. Even if you ask them, how do you explain this to your normal customer? 
Consdier that most restaurants don't post the credit card fees in part because it only confuses the customer, or discourages them from purchasing. So they instead just take the 3% or so fee as the cost of doing business. Add to that the fact that bitcoin fees are variable, and you don't know if it's too low until the transaction just sits without getting mined.
I suspect with the next halving we'll start to see miners advertise fees in realtime.

It looks like the concept is that you spend the unconfirmed bitcoin back to yourself, allocating more fees. 
Basically, you have transaction T1. This gives you money, but only if a miner will process it. Fee is too low, so miners don't want to bother. So you create transaction T2. T2 allocates more fees to miner. Miner really wants this transaction. However, T2 isn't valid on its own. A miner can process T1, T2 and T1, but not T2 alone. So they process T1 with T2.

I think your assessment is spot on. Unfortunately, such a contract penalizes the participants if a 3rd part sabotages the endeavor, so most of the bet is against this abstract 3rd party not destroying the mid-term value of bitcoin. Secondly, miners already made that bet -- they fronted local fiat currency for mining hardware, and those costs are sunk. 
I think you assess issue well. 


The problem with either SF or HF is that the very definition of bitcoin is under flux. Most likely, those coin would exist on both forks, be spendable on both forks, so fails at achieving a stake in only one side of a possible fork. Even if the contract said "can only be spent on core", the definition of classic could include "ignore the 'only on core' instruction in contract; call this fork 'core' too". 
Bitcoin even had one such fork -- the introduction of the 1MB limit. That fork said, in code, "revoke, past present and future, the validity of any block &gt; 1MB". Of course, none existed at the time (as far as we know), but if they did, that change caused a HF that revoked their validity.

I missed their agreement. I read the classic folks did some tests, but didn't hear of Chinese miners agreeing with the conclusion. I'd be interested in reading more if you could point me in the right direction. 
Notably, any soft fork proposal is one which doesn't strictly require their support - soft forks allow miners to continue mining with the old software and still mine new blocks, provided their source of new transactions does validation first. That lets them turn validation into an externality they don't have to deal with.

Yes, but in some respects the more relevant question is: what was the peak on *solvent* trading markets? At the peak of mtgox, usd was artificially reduced in value because there was no real usd cash to back it. If you had $1500 in mtgox, would you rather lose all of it, or convert it into $600 worth of btc?
@_date: 2015-10-20 20:39:21
Of course. I meant only that in isolation, it would decrease personal home ownership. Of course, additional indirect effects would occur, and I can't confidently predict the final effect on personal home ownership.
The problem I have with relying on the "come from savings" argument alone is that a lot of folks don't have savings to begin with. Unless rent also decreases substantially, they don't have a way to acquire the funds to make outright property purchases.
I do suspect adjustable mortgage models would be viable in such an economy though. E.g. you don't pay your loan toward a set price, but rather towards a percentage stake in the house. E.g. if I put 20k down on a 200k house, I'd have a 10% stake. If over the first term I pay down another 20k of principle (plus whatever interest), I'd then have a 20% stake in the house, the other 80% still held by the bank. If the bank says the house is now worth 100k, then I'm not underwater -- I have a 20% stake in an asset now valued at 100k. We either re-adjust the mortgage terms, or I can cash out. 
You're right about buying power though. They'd take 80k to pay off the house. Why? Because that 80k is just as valuable at that point as 160k would have been at the start of the loan.
Obviously the bank would need to insure against deflation risk as well, but that's why loan interest exists. The loan is a bet against extreme deflation. The weaker the bet, the higher the interest rate on the loan. 
My only point is that one can imagine financial devices where consumers are protected against deflation putting them "underwater" while at the same time seeing loan devices created that remain profitable.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:30:15
You're spot on. If bitcoin's hash were different in a way that made gpu and asics infeasible, the big miners would be running large stacks of Raspberry Pi-like hardware for better compute per watt and better compute per btc on hardware. You'd still have large farms of these devices raising the difficulty to the point that the typical home computer or cloud vm will lose money mining.

Ah, pardon, I didn't realize. I looked briefly at a couple of the price index sites, and none showed a peak greater than the peak of mtgox. I'd be interested in reading more about that peak if you had any references.

Perhaps, but keep in mind that rent can act as a pump of resources funds from a lower income to a higher one. Not sure if that's a desired goal. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:07:59


Apply some game theory to that scenario. Where that risk is likely, some rational agents will choose buy property under interest-only mortgaging, rent, and then after deflation becomes substantial, default on the loan. The bank recoups only $100k of the original $200k, while our rational agent makes 10 years of rent income paying little interest.
Given this situation, what variable would change due to supply and demand if enough agents did this? Renting supply would be flooded, and renting prices would be driven down close to interest rates. Renting property would become very cheap. 
The banks themselves wouldn't want this situation, since it increases their default risk. They want it to be in the interest of rational agents to pay off their loans in a timely manner. To incentivize that, I'd assume they'd offer protections against runaway deflation. For example, offering guaranteed refinancing tied to deflation rates. That gets you to pay on time, and should deflation become significant, offer you refinance at intervals. You may end up paying $120k + interest for a house now worth $100k, but that's better situation for the both of you than the alternative.
At least, that's my guess. I admit the "rational agent" assumption is a big leap though.

I think the idea is that a smaller subproblem, eg rendering 16x16 pixels of one frame, is the function you'd use. Verifying that task is fairly cheap (seconds). 
The problem is that proof of work requires a computational task (check) that is believed to be difficult to shortcut (um, nope, computer graphics algorithms improve every year), and which depends on the identity of the current chain (the movie's rendering depends on which hour it was rendering?)

This is a common trick or gambit that "established" newspapers pull. 
They look at the referrer tag. If they see google, they'll often show you the article without the paywall so that you'll read it, share the direct article link, and then have many people view the paywall. If they showed you the paywall directly, you'd be less likely to share it, giving them less exposure. If they showed no one the paywall, they assume no one would bother to sign up, also giving them less exposure.
A common workaround is to google the article title. This will bring up the article on google, and clicking through from the google results will have a lower probability of hitting the paywall. 
Edit-add: worked for me for this article. When clicked OP, I get the paywall. When I [google for the article's title]( and click the google link, no paywall. Using an "I'm feeling lucky" query results in a paywall, so they seem to be parsing the referrer URL pretty deep. YMMV.

IIRC, btc only reached $1200 after mtgox started demonstrating issues with withdrawing usd, before there was issue withdrawing btc. If one believed mtgox insolvent and was looking to minimize personal loss above all else, the logical conclusion would be to buy as much btc as possible with whatever usd balance you had in your mtgox account. After all, at least you can withdraw the btc.

While true, there may be tradeoffs to consider even if a merchant supports both options. For instance, perhaps they won't provide the goods or services immediately with a bitcoin transfer without either a state issued ID and/or waiting for the next block to confirm. Imagine ordering coffee and they don't serve it to you for 10 minutes. 
I'd liken the difference very roughly to that of fiat vs credit cards. Credit cards are an indirect means of handling fiat, like BitPay is an indirect means for handling bitcoin.

A fair question, but that's like asking why a credit card reader won't swipe your $10 note. A coinbase wallet uses BTC as its units, but it's a separate ledger. It ultimately resolves using bitcoin, but it isn't literally bitcoin just like a credit card swipe isn't literally cash.

This sounds right on paper, but a lot of systems would have to change for this to work in practice. Real world data would be invaluable. Disfavoring debt would decrease home ownership.
I'd be curious what an economy would look like with near zero inflation (e.g. slight deflation), deflation protection on moderate home loans, and a return to more stable, sustainable, and reasonable housing prices. With inflation no longer eating away at lower incomes, and greater stability for middle class incomes, it seems like a system for pumping wealth towards the middle, away from both extremes. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:25:52

If I were to guess, it's because there are bitcoin backing the side chains. I didn't read the paper yet, but I'm speculating that consensus signatures are need. In such a scheme, multiple nodes need to agree on how to move the bitcoin around on the actual bitcoin ledger, and the algorithm they use to form consensus involves actions on this sidechain. And when you want your bitcoin back out of the sidechain, you send your request to the nodes on the sidechain, and if they validate your request according to that chain's algorithm, they'll compute a signed bitcoin transaction you could submit back to the bitcoin chain to transfer those coins back to you. Transferring into and out of the sidechain is, as far as bitcoin is concerned, just another valid bitcoin transaction between you and some other bitcoin agent.
Again, this is speculation. I'd encourage reading the actual paper to be sure.

That is the peril of proprietary hardware, yes. 
My point is that even if you solve that problem (maybe you know someone wealthy that is honest, willing to sell you asics mining chip, or if the proof of work was tweaked to make asics mining infeasible) it still wouldn't be profitable to mine at small scale anymore. Asics or not, doesn't change the fact that there is more active mining hardware now.

From the sound of it, bought high price, but then transacted at low value. If the funds had confirmed faster, then they would have bought high, transacted at high value, and had their widget or whatever they were buying using bitcoin both sooner and with more BTC to spare.
Or, had the buy used the later price, they would have bought low, transacted low, also having more BTC in hand. In fact, precisely, the same USD-equivalent amount of BTC in hand as in the buy high, transact high, scenario.
While coinbase likely doesn't profit from this, it is an inefficiency for users.

I haven't seen a lot of details yet, but the coin validation site suggests some sort of "credit score" like system attached to wallets, and refuse to do business with wallets that have low score.
