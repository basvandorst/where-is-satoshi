I was locked out before I could transfer the coins out of the web wallet. Normally I would have used a wallet app.

I didn't know they had some kind of reputation. I used them since they're outside my jurisdiction which I don't fully trust.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:25:45
They won't. How can I prove its mine? It was a fresh account with no personal information
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:33:06
Can't change it. I'm locked out.
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:12:10
Can't verify since I didn't wrote down wallet address prior to being locked out and now I can no longer retrieve that information.

Anyone having access to my email can easily reset the password for the bitcoin market and than he/she has both: email and a new password and access to my bitcoin.

Ok it's true. I got payed seven dollars to make this up. At its core it's an antirussian conspiracy, because that would make sense I guess. Also what's more important than Russia? Can't imagine anything. I'm actually a homeless person in the US. Stay sharp comrade

Yeah I thought the same. Suing is challenging since it's a Russia based company and I'm not a Russia based citizen. I'm not saying it's 'yandex' but maybe a rouge employee? It certain looks that way although I've got no proof.

Highly professional nickname.

Yeah funny but when you trade online and get locked out before you can transfer your coins to any other wallet, your neat hardware wallet becomes useless.

Yes I just wanted to empathize that I'm not exactly sure who's responsible, yandex staff or an third party.

Oh you must be incredibly smart. Just when I wanted to transfer the funds to my safe wallet, I realized I was already locked out. It wasn't as if I parked them on the web wallet for ages. More like a few hours.
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:37:17
No I basically used the email one single time to register at localbitcoins.com and since I can rule out my system being compromised I concluded it must be an issue with Yandex. How would anyone know which email to attack?

I'm aware of cookies but thanks anyways. You can't disable it if you can no longer log in.

Think for yourself

No it's not the web wallet. I used the trading platform (localbitcoins.com)  since then and encountered no issues, since I used a different email provider
