...how is it greedy to not want to lose money..?
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:49:39
I bought in at $15,999, then at $16,800, then FOMO'd and bought $1,300 more at $19,249. My *stop-bitching* level is right about where yours is... :(
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:59:50
Uh... If you take a loss, then not only can you obviously NOT be taxed for capital GAINS, but i belive you get a tax break for capital LOSSES if you report it right.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:34:15
We'll obviously you don't know if it's a pump or a bubble or whatever until it's already over. Everyone thought it was on a meteoric rise at that point.
Also I would care if it stayed stable,  I just want it to go up enough that I'm not operating at a perpetual loss
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:49:41
We all saw it going up, and knew from the past that if we'd waited until it hit like 30,000 or 50,000 we'd be absolutely kicking ourselves just like everyone who kicks themselves now for not buying in during last upward bound. Here's hoping for 80,000 in 2018 I guess.  ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Good question,  and I've been researching the same things (for crypto currency and also my investments in the now-exploding weed stocks). And no, you only get taxed on GAINS - meaning what you pulled out versus what you put in. If what you pulled out is LESS than what you put in, then it will be a capital LOSS and will be subtracted from all other capital gains on your tax return by the IRS. I'm learning too :)
EDIT - stupid fucking autocorrect :/

I bought at 19k, so here's hoping lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:32:39
I always heard $10k was the expectation by the end of 2017 fire a long time; $40k seems awfully optimistic for that time-frame. Either way it's a rollercoaster; HODL or panic-sell, your choice. Imma HODL for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:57:00
When you say _unconfirmed,_ are you insinuating _lost?_ Like, someone just might _never_ get their Bitcoins and also never get their money back _either?_ Is that the situation we're dealing with?
Or are we just talking very delayed transaction floating in cyberspace, awaiting acknowledgment/processing by an overburdened infrastructure? Basically I guess I'm kind of asking if it's dangerous for me to buy a few thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin via my verified Coinbase account - or is this roughly the equivalent of lighting my money on fire in a pile on the street?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:18:45
 Well at least you've _made_ an overall return on investment lol. The cheapest I bought at was like $15,990 or so, then somewhere in the $16k range, then I FOMO'ed and bought at $19k lol. I'm like a couple grand underwater atm :(  Only one thing for me to do:  HODL and hope!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:21:30
Is it usually people talking positively about Bitcoin, or is it usually a bunch of idiots bashing the "fake nerd Monopoly-money" or old-school economic-advisor types talking smack, etc.?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:24:38
Buy the dip during the end-of-year slump and HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:46:42
When you say this, are you referring to _buying_ Bitcoin as well as selling? And how big would a transaction be for you to consider it "big" and make you worry about significant confirmation wait-time?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:37:33
Wait till this time NEXT year when it hits $50k+ and then see how you feel :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:31:26
Thank you for that clarification. So no one is actually _losing_ BTC or money over this, aside from the fact that they are unable to manipulate/reinvest the money that is tied up in the queue (and hence missing out of available investment income opportunity)?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:33:21
I bought 3 times,  the final $1,300 worth being purchased at the $19k level, but oh well. I will HODL my 1/2 of a BTC :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:15:17
I have a probably-dumb question (my quick Google search yielded no easy answer... maybe I'm phrasing it wrong..?): When you "cash out" and return your bitcoin to actual USD, do you get taxed on the whole entire amount you are converting back to USD, or just on the _difference_ between the originally invested amount and the new amount (like getting taxed on gains when you sell stock that has appreciated)? And furthermore - something I imagine someone on this specific subreddit might be more apt to ELI5 - are there any hidden pitfalls/extenuating circumstances to be aware of in this regard? Just a tentative new investor trying to gather info, so thanks for any replies and patience :)
[EIT] - After expanding some hidden replies I now see that you answered the first part about capital gains on bitcoin sales, but if you have any further advice/warnings on extenuating circumstances and/or pitfalls, I'd still appreciate your expertise on that... Thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:30:28
You think so? I've stashed my BTC in a Nano wallet in a safety deposit box and forgotten about it because I just assume it's basically not going _anywhere_ for years, if _ever_ again. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 01:52:25
What makes you say this? I've been hearing this around Reddit for a few weeks now. I'd moved on to r/weedstocks to help me in my apparent quest to lose money, but a guy on that sub just told me the same thing today which is why I have wandered back over to this sub to take a gander at the scene. Background is that I'm a salty miserable jaded bagholder, having spent like $9,000+ on 0.6525 BTC back in late 2017/early 2018 and now it's just sitting in my safe in cold storage.
Is there some kind of semi-regular time-cycle for BTC or something? Some upcoming catalysts? Or just blind, desperate hope? I've otherwise basically just written off my BTC as a loss at this point :/
@_date: 2019-02-27 01:53:48
Well let's hope _that_ continues; I've been bagholding so hard since January 2018 that I basically have no choice but to continue bagholding until things improve _(if_ they improve this time) :/
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:33:26
Yeah,  I bought a small portion at that range, when everyone was howling about going to the moon. Not enough that I'm really hurting right now, but yeah, it's still demoralizing. All you can do is HODL and hope. Who knows - maybe the predictions will come true and it will hit $50k or $80k later this year. Or maybe it'll hit $600 and just stay there. No one knows, so I'm just not sweating it.

...why is this crappy screenshot 6.2MB in size?  This is pointlessly huge and also horrid on mobile. Please think ahead and compress your pics before posting.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:47:22
Hmm. I've been hanging on in the hopes that BTC will go back up at some point (I don't really _need_ the money and have kind of written it off at this point TBH), and it's sitting in a Nano Ledger in my safety deposit box. You think I should just sell and invest elsewhere? You think BTC isn't going to go back up to any significant level towards the end of the year, or in the next few years? I'm not really in a hurry about it, really. I could let it sit and marinate for another 3-5 years and be fine.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:20:00
Me too! Yay for the 0.5 BTC club lol. Now if I just hadn't bought in at the $16k level I might be in good shape, owning an entire single BTC  :(   Ugh, the pain...
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:01:47
Although I only bought a small portion of my overall BTC at that level (about $1,300 worth at $19,200 level), I am one of those fucks :(  I literally have no real choice but to HODL
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:13:53
Does the "Wash Rule" apply to BTC like it does to stocks? Would I have to sell all my BTC, then wait 31 days, and then buy back in at a lower price point? Also, I've never messed with BTC and taxation; does Coinbase send you some sort of formalized tax reporting form?
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:46:35
I choose to believe this.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:56:04
Ha! Stupid suckers! _I bought_ Bitcoin at $14,380, then at $16,163, and then more at $19,231! 
So I win, right?
Note that this is not sarcasm, I actually did this. FML.
