It is just the way mining works. If a LOT of miners go up then difficulty will skyrocket eating into your profits. The system wants a block to be solved every ten minutes and will re-balance itself to make sure that happens.
Power costs! Eventually it will reach a point where you will be playing more to keep the miner online than it will make for you per month and then you well be stuck with a dead weight.
Mining has turned into a industry. If you want to make dough invest in the mining companies. It is a safer bet just to buy the Bitcoins outright honestly.
I mine as a hobby because I believe in bitcoin and want to keep the network secure. Hope this helps.

The uninformed and it makes me sad because people learn you can mine bitcoins but they know nothing about how difficultly works so they rush out and buy miners that are overpriced and bad.
I mine as a hobby. I only really care if the miner can pay for itself in electricity and even then i would probably run it cause I want to support the network. It's been impossible for me to pick up any miners because of the crazy high prices.
Good on you for refusing to sell for crazy silly prices!

**Short Selling**: Short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller doesn't own.
 If the price drops, you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference. If the price of the stock rises, you have to buy it back at the higher price, and you lose money.

Difficulty is intended to keep block generation at a constant of 1 block every 10 minutes. The more power that hits the network the faster they get solved. So we have to make it harder for people to solve. to keep the mean

At its root its a simple lottery. people enter and every two weeks a winner would chosen.
1% of the total pot would be donated to charity or to other bitcoin start-up depending on votes cast during the entry phase.
I would bankroll the first pot, I like to call the genesis pot, with 1BTC to provide incentive for people to use it. The main thing I want is exposure and people seeing how useful bitcoins are and getting other projects off the ground.
I'm not completely sure how I would price an entry though.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:44:31
1.) People see the "We Use Coin" Video
2.) People see you can mine Bitcoin from said video
3.) People do the least amount of research and buy block erupters
4.) Price of BTC has gone up
5.) Resellers are taking advantage of this

[Analysis]( for the baby jet
[Analysis]( for the TerraMinerIV
This is assuming a steady 30% difficulty increase and assume you get it within the time-frame you could make ROI. These are also rough estimates if anyone has better data let me know. You can mine for yourself. I don't know what your friend is up to just know that both of these machine will be useless in a few months after buying them from my estimates.

Yes, Some bot-nets do this.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:55:35
1.     New transactions are broadcasted to all nodes.
1.     Each miner node collects new transactions into a block.
1.     Each miner node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
1.     When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
1.     New bitcoins are successfully collected or "mined" by the receiving node which found the proof-of-work.
1.     Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
1.     Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
1.     Repeat.

I've read several books on buying/selling stocks and long term investing. Several points are very clear from studying recent market trends. One of the most pronounced is the impact of news.

I was just thinking about this as well.
Could I just have my name, address, contact info on the site?
How about registering it as legal business?

If you understood how mining works then you would know that this is a terrible deal.
Mining and Investing do not go together.

It might possibly crash at any moment. All it takes is for someone to do a massive flood of coins on the market. I would honestly wait before buying in at this point. Then again the ceiling could be higher than I expected.
