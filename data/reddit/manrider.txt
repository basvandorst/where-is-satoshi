why aren't conservatives more into bitcoin? (not the libertarian kind, i mean) "evade taxes! screw big government!" actually i think i know why: they're generally afraid of things that are different than what they're used to.

You could swap "bitcoin" and "other coins" for "my longterm relationship" and "someone new" and it makes as much sense 
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:55:17
That's the joke he was making... right?
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:38:46


Well they could make the same claims about Bitcoin and try to ban that. Would you like that? But besides, plenty of "criminal activities" should not be against the law to begin with, and in some instances the more ethical thing to do is break a law. Until that all changes then the idea of more financial freedom through cash can't be discounted entirely.

You could point to Venezuela as your example, but Norway has a similar situation with oil and they're doing very well as a country.

Vinny Lingham has argued that Bitcoin is effectively a commodity, and it now needs to prove itself as a store of value, then it can potentially become an effective currency (with a more stable price)

sure, but the argument in the original post was that bitcoin can come fill a void in the financial services of the legal weed industry. i think the potential for that is there but if it was going to happen in california i'd expect to see more of that already underway in states that already legalized recreational usage.
@_date: 2016-11-09 13:08:55
Is there any evidence of bitcoin being used much in the states for this purpose where it has already been legalized for recreational use? I haven't seen any yet but I'd be glad to.

good point. i hope those become very robust and effective. but we'll see what happens i suppose. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:50:38
maybe not, but as a store of value it has been doing very well.

they still control fiat, and if they clamp down on the exchanges that could really impact crypto. wouldn't get rid of it entirely, sure, but still significant.

It's good advice, although I'd say a crash of 50% down from the peak is a lot more likely than 75%. And now there's so much broad interest and new money flooding in I would be surprised if it even goes as much as 50% down.

The rates for long term capital gains are much lower than the tax rates for earning income by actually working for it, so I hope you can appreciate that favorable difference even if you wish you didn't have to pay the tax you owe.

"some people are so blindly enthusiastic about bitcoin i better be just as extreme in my negativity"
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:39:41
right now consumers don't have a lot of incentive to use bitcoin to buy most things. unless you're getting paid with BTC you have to do something to obtain them, only some businesses accept it, and then the benefit of avoiding credit card fees is often not passed on to the consumer. the first and last things especially need to change if there is to be a greater consumer use. why exert effort to get a currency that is less universal than your national currency?

bad government is the enemy of freedom. good government is the defender of freedom.
[edit] what i mean is, a government is shitty if it's the enemy of freedom, which in this case it is. however, there can exist good government which defends the freedom of people and serves as an institution for the public good.

It's not just a 15% flat tax on capital gains though. It varies a lot depending on whether it's short or long term, and what your total income is along with these potential bitcoin transactions.

1) collect all files and information needed to access the coins into a folder, such as private keys and wallet passwords. write up some instructions on how to use them if that seems necessary for the potential recipient.
2) encrypt the folder with a password using winzip or other similar method.
3) give copies of this to everyone who you'd want to get access to your coins if you died
4) set a deadman's switch that gives them the password to the encrypted if activated. For instance, schedule an email with the password to be sent in a few months, and then every time that's a week away push it back a few months. if you're not able to get online and delay the email long enough it will get sent.

it's understandable that you'd have this misunderstanding, as a lot of us bitcoin believers do as well, but thinking of bitcoin only as a wannabe currency is to miss the bigger picture. it has already functioned effectively as a commodity, and is now in the process of proving itself as a store of value. even if it never takes off as a widespread, proper currency it could still be valued higher than it is now with a primary use as a store of value. if you'd like to learn more about these ideas, this article is helpful:

I've been using Bitcoin since 2013, and I understand that governments can't actually destroy it, you dunce. But if enough of them constrain it's use sufficiently then that would drastically lower its value.
@_date: 2015-10-01 01:51:47
i know people often talk about it being difficult to learn or use, but personally after i learned about it and started using it i sincerely like using it. it's about as easy as email to use, except that the addresses are a little more complicated so you want to copy/paste/camera them into your wallet. 
the biggest pain is transitioning to and from fiat. staying within the bitcoin system it's pretty peachy compared to other ways of sending or receiving money. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 01:47:14
what about DASH?
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:30:29
Exactly. For instance, another cryptocurrency replacing it while bitcoin dies from disuse. Or governments across the world restricting it so heavily that it falls to the margins as a small fringe activity.
