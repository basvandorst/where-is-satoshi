WorldRemit sends airtime, not M-Pesa.  There is a big difference.

Yes -- just talked to their team yesterday.  Having worked in development and NGO/Foundation-funding for years in Africa, I know that the operational cost can sometimes eat waaaay too much into the donations.  On the other end of the spectrum, without a bit of infrastructure, it is really hard to ensure that your donation is getting to the right place.  GiveDirectly seems to have a great structure for keeping their operations at a super low-cost.  Would love to help them move their coin into KES. Watch this space for other partnerships like this with BitPesa!!

Hey everyone -- WSJ just updated the article to include the announcement that Joe Mucheru, Kenya Country Head and Sub-Saharan Ambassador for Google has invested in BitPesa! Along with Barry Silbert of SecondMarket....we are trying to get the best in the Bitcoin and Africa Tech scene to join in and get this project done right!  Please check out the site  and give us feedback on the experience!

Hi BitPesa CEO here -- MPesa is awesome.  We use it daily...in fact I rarely touch cash here in Kenya.  However, how do I load my MPesa when I am abroad? How do relatives and friends send me "money" in a way I can use? Currently, there are credit card--&gt;MPesa services and WU/Moneygram options to remit to MPesa. All options are either expensive or exclusive (to those who do not have credit cards).

Hi!! Are you buying Btc using a Dutch bank account?  Which bank?

We just started last October...going live in 8 months is pretty fast for a Kenyan start-up! Lots of red-tape over here.  Trying our best to get this service up and running and spread it across East Africa as fast as we can!

We are open, S! Try out our site! Just working on integration with a 3rd party info-service which is why we have not done a media campaign saying we are "launched."

A big problem in Kenya is the fact that the Kenyan Shilling is not easy to exchange.  In general the FX trade for African Currencies are illiquid and controlled by a few banks with international reputations.  Most of these banks are in South Africa --- a 5 hour flight from Kenya.  ANY REMITTANCE service  will need to address this.  Reducing the cost of remittances by eliminating banking and bank-priced FX is the lowest-hanging fruit for Bitcoin-based remittance services.  Introducing digital currencies and wallets to every micro-vendor and merchant in Africa will take a bit of time.  Until then -- why not put a thorn in the banks and money remittance services, like WU?  Why not shake it up and get them to lower their crazy margins?  Currently, the margins on African remittances are double that of SE Asia.  BitPesa is addressing this problem right now.  Not a scam.  Any good Bitcoin service company should be working toward wider retail adoption...and will remove itself as a middleman as the ecosystem evolves.

Hi all, Elizabeth from Bitpesa here :)   is LIVE! Go ahead and try it! You can use it from anywhere but a US IP address.  We are calling it a "beta launch" because we want to collect some feedback on the UX before we do a marketing blitz.  All of the other international cash --&gt; MPesa or Mobile Money channels are more expensive or slower or require the use of a credit card.  We are cheap, quick, and inclusive.  Also - we allow seamless payment with coin...so we are cooler!

Hi - CEO BitPesa here -- Im glad you are such a fan of MPesa -- so are we! However there are many use cases where MPesa does not work internationally.  Additionally, you were charged $0.99, but surely the KES rate you received was not the market rate, rather negative a significant margin.   BitPesa takes 3% off the market rate, no additional fee. Special rates for larger amounts. So still the cheapest option out there. Also, 95% of our many clients are Kenyan nationals!  All of our BTC Sales are from Kenyans -- we have seen huge volumes this first week of selling!  Looks like Kenyans are like every other population on the planet -- excited about innovative, cheap, and efficient technology!!
