I see your point, 
But i would argue Bitcoin, stocks and minerals are all different in their own ways and there are aspects to them that are unique.
I belive all stocks are bought in the intention of reciving dividends either at current time or in the future. while bitcoin is not giving dividends and are purely based on prise increase and usecase. 
Im no expert in what gold is valued on nowadays, but it has a demand where the buyers of gold can actually use the mineral to create even more valuable things like jewelry and in for computers and such. while in bitcoin you cant create value from your bitcoin, its solely dependent on new investors and adoption. 
dont know if this is relevant but another thought i had is :
If you own all the gold in world, its still super valueable, 
If you own all the stocks in amazon, its super valueable, 
but if you own all the bitcoin in the world, its useless.

Thanks, while cross checking a couple sources on the definition on the ponzi scheme i have concluded its not an Ponzi Scheme by definition. 
However im still not convinced bitcoin is not some new type of scheme, lets call it "smart coin scheme" which instead of generateing returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, its based on prise increase with new investors.
bitcoin still offers abnormally high returns like ponzies. 
 And bitcoin rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide prise increase for older investors and to keep the vision of adoption alive. When this flow runs out, the coin falls apart.

I bought 2 bitcoins in june 2017 for 2800 each because I got interested and used a couple 100 hours researching the tech and I liked it alot. 
Nowadays all i do is ponder about huge ramifications with both bitcoin being a sucsess and with bitcoin failing misserably. 
Even tho i like the blockchain, i still get a feeling that bitcoin is scummy in the way its investment system works. 
If its not about "returns" why not finish the development for fullscale implementation with all problems solved before issuing investment opportunities? because early investors want returns.

I agree. But what happends if a ton of people want to cash out of crypto in a short amount of time. we think we have control of our assets because we have private keys and wallets and our assets are accessible on the exchanges. in most schemes you are free to cash out but its not preffered and they will convince you not to or be difficult about it, untill too many want to cash out and they pull the plug and run. In bitcoin I wonder if too many want to cash out to fiat what will happen. We already see exchanges being difficult with withdrawals and such. and who is backing the bitcoin if enough people want to cash out to fiat? someone gotta buy it from you in fiat.

yea, i did not mean that bitcoin is not functional because of that. just that gold is valuable in another way then currencies. 
i also ponder if we make a copy of bitcoin so that its the exact same, is it worth the same as bitcoin the end? 
the way gold is unique from any other mineral, bitcoin is not unique from bitcoin clones in function.

actually, if people want to cash out to fiat you depend on the exchanges to send you your fiat do you not? 
they have no problem with this on low values, but what about if huge amounts gets cashed out, will they redeem 10billion dollar cash outs for example?

But if enough people want to cash out to fiat, what happends.
say a whale wants to cash out 4 billion USD worth of Bitcoin to fiat on Coinbase or any other place that offers bitcoin to fiat transactions. can the likes of Coinbase afford it? who is paying for this? does the possibility exist that the system could crash if enough people wants to exit what they considered an investment for profits? and is that not scheme like, easy to enter hard to exit?

In most ponzi and pyramid schemes, usually the early investors get gains and increase in investment worth, but it is still schemes.
