Scarcity does not equal value. I have some old book reports from grade school at my house. There are only about 5 of them in the entire planet....that doesn't mean they have value. The question to ask oneself is: 'do bitcoins have intrinsic value?' Absent of intrinsic value, scarcity isn't going to mean a thing. Lots of things are scarce and valueless.

Have you been living under a rock or is this a joke?  Mt gox is falling apart. It would be like handing over money to Bernie madoff the day he was busted.  I get the feeling though that this may be a troll post.

It has nothing to do with someone screwing you over...it's also legitimate mistakes or disagreements.  Case in point...National Car Rental charged me $20 for going through a toll when I didn't even have the car yet. I tried calling them but the hold times were way too long.  Called my credit card company and they reversed it in 2 minutes....there is value in that convenience.

1) The double conversion is still cheaper than fiat money transfers. --&gt; I don't know enough about this one since I never use Western Union 9nor does anyone else that I know)
2) Your credit card rewards pale in comparison to the total fees you pay them. --&gt;  I pay them $0 in fees. Plus I get 3% cash back on my daily card. 
3) Do you believe your fiat banking information is secure? --&gt; I believe that I have $250K in FDIC insurance on each account that I own.  I also believe that my colleague would not be able to reverse engineer my automatic payroll deposits.

Really?  How many international purchases are you comfortable making without any purchase protection at all?  Legit question.  Paypal's dispute resolution sucks but at least it is something.  With Bitcoin, once the transaction is done, there is no turning back.

"The volatility allows a lot of people to make a good profit from their trades if they would just wait."
You don't know this.  People said this in 2000 when internet stocks were crashing.  Sometimes assets don't recover and people lose their shirts. You might be right, and it may recover. But it also might not.  It's dangerous to think that there is only one potential outcome. Personally, I don't care what you do but I simply offer up the view that there are no sure things in investing. Simply holding for a higher price is not a fool-proof strategy.  There are countless investors who have gone broke doing this (check out Lenny Dykstra's trading strategy as one example)

When the price has dropped 24.85% in the past 24 hours.   A 'Bear' market is considered a drop of 20% or more. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:14:57
You must be like the richest person in the world then, no?  Best of luck.  One might ask you of the result of something permanently falling below the price X, but let's not concern ourselves with petty details like that...we've got some easy money to make! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:54:41
You might be right.  It is clearly in Mt Gox's interest to keep prices high and as stable as possible.  They are one of the big losers in any crash back down to earth in prices.

514 coins were just traded at $850. Someone is trying hard to maintain a floor.  Watch out below if that person(s) looses their hold on that floor.

When did I say it was a stock?  Right, I didn't.  Commodities also enter bear markets....Gold is in one now.  Silver also.  Bitcoin is in a 'bear' market currently.  Try as you might, you can call it whatever you'd like.  It is still down ~20% in one day.

if BofA says to Buy, you know it is time to Sell.

run a search....lots of people have had coins stolen 'from' their coinbase accounts...but not 'by' coinbase as far as anyone can tell.

I'm not claiming that bitcoin isn't useful. It may very well go up in value considerably.  I am simply pointing out the flawed logic in the statement that "Since bitcoin is deflationary by design it can not go wrong".  This is flat our wrong.  There are many things in life that are in limited supply and yet do not go up in value. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:20:04
There are a lot of things that are more rare in this work than bitcoins and their price does not go up into the millions. Think about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:06:22
wow. so simple. so buy low / sell high.  this is truly groundbreaking stuff here.  You totally cracked the code on trading. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:02:40
by this logic, anything with limited supply will constantly rise in value.  Would you like to buy my 6th grade art project?  There is literally only one of them in the entire world.  It is deflationary by design. I accept bitcoin or fiat.

I'm simply pointing out the definition of a 'bear' market. Be it one that lasts decades or one that last 5 minutes.  The term is used to describe past movements in an asset and is not an indication of where the asset will move in the future (hence why I am not selling as you say). The OP was asking why people are referring to this price movement as a 'crash'...I'm explaining why. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:32:30
no need....there is an active market.  we can both 'bet' directly into the bitcoin market by investing according to our views.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:52:28
"I don't know but it looks like some people are selling…" - really?  you don't know???  1) people are always selling, likewise people are always buying....every trade has a buyer and a seller.
Why would you ask on reddit if you should sell? Nobody knows any better than anyone else.  The market moves based on people's opinion....That's all you need to watch to get the opinions of others. Nobody on a message board is going to be able to provide you meaningful advice. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:51:29
oh brother.  If you are going to make investment decisions based on internet message boards, you shouldn't have 'invested' in the first place.  If you need the money and will be negatively impacted if BTC falls to $0, then you should cash out now.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:57:01
it's actually still a lot lower than this morning around 11am EST
EDIT:  Not any longer....huge sell order hitting now...maybe my screen was lagged.  Volume is spiking pretty rapidly.

$310  (let the downvotes begin)
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:54:21
Why did it go up 16% in the last 7 days?  you will not get any answer that will explain these things.  Supply and Demand....irrational and rational moves made by both buyers and sellers....nothing more, nothing less.
