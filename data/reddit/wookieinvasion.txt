Primes were converted from the original hashlets initially, which were 16 bucks or whatever. Depending on when you got in, you could have made a killing on them.

Even if Bitcoin fizzles, blockchain tech is most likely here to stay, so you'll probably be able to convert to some other up and coming crypto.

Thank you for taking the time to donate, and choosing to protect our water. More than 3 million people, mostly women and children, die every year due to lack of clean drinking water.
RIP Hal!

It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.

I will say nothing of the other products, but the lifestraw Infowars sells is literally saving lives in Africa right now, clean water is really a tad more critical than snakeoil.

Third party vendor, it's an outreach program, has nothing to do with infowars, it is about saving lives, but someone with the name of boywonder should be smart enough to figure that out all on his own 8)
Have a wonderful day.
