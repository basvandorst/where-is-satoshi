If you are that worried about it, why not just set a stop order so it executes automatically if the price tanks?

If they are manipulating the market - they don't hold &amp; stay long. They sell shorts, dump the BTC to crater the price, then profit by covering the shorts at the now-much-lower price. Rinse &amp; repeat.

I wasn't online when it happened - but did any of the orders ever actually process? From the info I'm seeing on GDAX's pages, it's very many orders ever actually processed.

[Stop Loss Order](




@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:08
Well, given the lack of regulation (in the US) around crypto-currencies - I assume they could legally coordinate their moves?
Speculation about how this would work is certainly beyond my understanding, but I think that's part of the point - these are the pros getting into this game, and they have more experience, knowledge, and resources on trading &amp; markets &amp; manipulations than all of us redditors. 
I think it's prudent to be wary, because they aren't out to help drive crypto adoption or change the world, they just want to make money - and they see a brand new market of [mostly] total noobs sitting around with the new shiny.

I'm sure others have written much more clear explanations, but I'll give it a shot here anyway...
First, we have to explain what a "wallet" is - a "digital wallet" is simply the combination of:
* Your **public key** (eg the wallet's address that you send cryptocurrency to - this address/public key is what gets saves in the blockchain transactions)
* Your **private key**  
This private key is super-critical because it is the only thing that lets you withdraw cryptocurrency **out** of a wallet (eg public key), to transfer to another wallet/address.
So there are 2 big risk factors:
1. **Loss:** If you lose the private key, you can never transfer any cryptocurrency out of that wallet. End of story. This is where you get all the media stories about people "losing" thousands of bitcoins; those bitcoins aren't gone (they are still in the blockchain tied to the public key), but those people formatted or trashed the hard drives that had those private keys, and so now no one can ever transfer those bitcoins OUT of those wallets.
2. **Theft:** If someone else steals / hacks / copies your private key, then they can transfer the entire contents of your wallet out to a totally different address. In fact, this JUST HAPPENED to a popular mining company called NiceHash; allegedly their company wallet had ~4500 BTC in it, and somehow a hacker got hold of the private key for that wallet and transferred all of those BTC to another wallet (presumably one the hacker owns/controls). And now Nicehash is pretty much SOL.
So what exactly is a hardware wallet?
Well first, it's a physical USB device that securely contains the private key inside it's hardware. This protects you from theft/hacking because if your computer gets hacked with malware, the hackers can't get the private key (because it's saved on the hardware wallet).  If the hardware wallet gets stolen - you still have a some protection because they are protected with a PIN, which (at least on the Ledger Nano S) will wipe the device if too many incorrect PIN entries are entered.
How does it protect against loss? Well, being a separate physical device, it's not tied to a specific computer or hard drive - so if your computer crashes or gets stolen or gets thrown away, you don't lose your private key. But if your hardware wallet were to get lost or stolen - well, there's a remedy for that too. The hardware wallets give you a list of "seed words". The way it works - you can take those seed words and use those to initialize a new hardware wallet, and then that new hardware wallet will have the same private key as your old one. It's sort of like a "hint" to the hardware as to what the private key is.
So you need to protect those seed words just as securely as the hardware wallet itself - because knowing those seed words can get you the private key. That's why they recommend manually writing those seed words down on paper -- never save them electronically (eg don't save them in Notepad, or email, or snap a picture with your phone, etc). 
And then don't store them in the same place as your hardware wallet -- if your home gets robbed or burns down or destroyed by fire/tornado/hurricane/earthquake - you don't want to lose your digital wallet AND your backup seed words!  So find a safe way to store those seed words, separately from your hardware wallet!
Hope this helps :)

These 2 statements are very much at odds with one another. The simple fact is - in a well-regulated system users can be somewhat protected from their own actions by the fiat power of the central authority.  People make mistakes, they can get tricked or be robbed - there are many reasons why a central authority with the power to undo actions is appealing.  
I don't keep my savings in a stash of cash under my bed because I'd have no recourse to recovery if it gets stolen or my house burns down. I keep it in an FDIC-insured bank, with every confidence that if something bad happens to my account or my bank, I won't lose my money.
If my wife, or my parents, had $20k savings, I would have no concerns with them keeping it in an FDIC-insured bank; but I would be wracked with fear if they had 1 BTC stored in a digital wallet. If it's an online wallet - they could get malware or get hacked or even just get tricked by pop-ups or shady websites. If it's an offline wallet - they could get robbed, have a fire, simply lose it, or accidentally destroy it.  
Teaching people proper security &amp; backup measures -- and ensuring they follow them every day -- is a big ask. And you basically have to be 100% - if you screw up even once, you could lose your BTC savings permanently. That's a pretty huge risk!

I'm no expert in the field - but they don't necessarily have to all go together; just not step on each other's toes.
eg Hedge Fund A sells their futures and starts dumping BTC, then Hedge Fund B sits this ride out and just holds whatever they've got; waits until the crash then loads up for their run?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:45
I'm in this boat - the challenge is, how much to buy? Spend too much now, and if a bigger dip (or even crash) comes, then you're out of dry powder to backup the truck! But if you don't buy (or buy just a little), you risk missing out if it turns out this is/was "the dip".
It's all about balance, of course - balancing these risks and your financial situation. But that doesn't make it easy!

The interesting thing is that salary research suggests "solving the money thing" happens at around $75k/yr USD ([link](




Besides, once you get to a certain point of wealth, then you worry about having too much money and that problems THAT causes ([link](

These headlines are outrageous - this title is based on the premise of all 48 million of Argentina’s citizens converting their entire $10k (USD equivalent) annual salary into BTC. That simply ain’t happening in the foreseeable future. 
Or I’ll eat a chocolate chip cookie. Hey - I’m no global affairs expert!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:02
Possibly - but in 6 months it could have grown to $30k and stabilized around there, in which case buying at $17k doesn't seem so bad.
Or it could tank down to $8k in 2 weeks - it's anyone's guess!

I've always interpreted it to mean - "don't invest based on emotion (&amp; following the market swings), invest based on rational evaluation of price to value".  
Which means - don't invest in Pets.com in 1999 just because it's the Dot Com boom and everyone's throwing money at anything "on the internet". 
It also means - invest in well-run banks, newspapers and railroads that have good business fundamentals, but that everyone's running away from because they are so "last century".
In my opinion...
* It doesn't mean that someone can't make money following the crowd. *Because plenty of people did make a lot of money in the dot com boom*
* Or that old-school industries is the **absolute** best place
to put your investments for growth. *Because Bank of America, Lee Enterprises, and BNSF Railway aren't going to produce explosive growth*
Just that this method should provide you a steady, relatively safe portfolio that should let you sleep well at night.

It was a poor attempt at humor - your car literally shitting in your bed was (for me) a funny mental image :-/
For the record - I totally agree that everyone should have a "rainy day fund" to pay for those unexpected emergencies. Unfortunately, those that need it most are rarely in a position to build it :-(

Strictly as an investment vehicle, you are correct.
However, purchasing a [primary] home is not **only** an investment - it's also providing for basic needs (shelter), and housing costs are typically a huge impact on your cost-of-living / cash flow.  If I had enough BTC to cash out &amp; pay off my mortgage - I would totally do it!
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:48:10
That’s the strength of BTC - if I am a gold owner, where is my physical gold? I don’t have it - which means I have to trust whomever does hold the physical gold that (and any intermediate owners), that their record-keeping is flawless, that they haven’t double-sold the gold that they say I own, etc. 
You have these same trust issues if you hold BTC on an exchange - but unlike gold, you can easily take control of your own BTC wallet and it has very little impact on your ability to transfer/spend BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:51:19
That's certainly my plan! :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:21:12
Exactly - "buy and hold" is a great investing strategy... until it isn't.  See [Enron circa 2002](
In traditional (long-term) asset investing, "buy and hold" is the mantra to avoid emotional (irrational) decision-making. But even then, you [should] periodically re-evaluate your investment case for that asset to ensure there has not been a material change that affects your calculations of that asset's value.
Certainly that's much harder to do with Bitcoin, considering it's not a tangible asset with traditional valuation models.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:49:23
I have no idea :)
Generally speaking, I interpret it to be contrarian - sell when the price is going to the moon, and buy when others are jumping out of windows. Assuming, of course, that you have done your due diligence to determine that you are investing in a solid asset that will recover the value that Mr. Market is irrationally shedding.
Warren Buffet (who said that quote) is considered to be a great investor because of his ability to analyse businesses and determine fair values, and then purchase/invest in those businesses when the broader market has unfairly / irrationally discounted them.
As for Bitcoin - we don't have a valuation model that fits (or at least I haven't seen one), so "fair value" is impossible to determine.  I certainly see the parabola as being "greedy" - and if Bitcoin were a significant/substantial part of my investment portfolio I would be selling &amp; re-balancing at this time.
However - for me it's "fun money". If it goes to zero, my retirement is not impacted. If it goes to Mars - then my retirement might come early :)  And everything in between, I'm just going to hold until I have a better use for those funds.
For example - I could cash out now and pay off my car. That'd be nice, but it wouldn't change my life.  If it hits $100k+ in a year (or two, or three) - where I can then cash out &amp; pay off my house -- that's a much more compelling offer that I would probably take advantage of, because that would have a huge impact on my living situation.
To each his/her own :)
