Yeah because bitcoins are as revolutionary as computers. Please, you are delusional. How do bitcoins increase productivity?  Oh wait, they don't. At best, coins reduce transaction costs, but even that is debatable given the latest hiccups.  
What is the motive for the masses to adopt bitcoins?

It's not arbitrage if there is risk.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:15:01
You realize that what all of you are describing is why bitcoin will never be used by the masses?  
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:03:34
And you're too dumb to realize you're setting them up and I'm calling you out. 
Edit:  sigh, this is why I don't engage delusional people in discussion.  You dismiss any opposing idea as anti-intellectual and any person who disagrees with you as a troll. Confirmation from the like-minded must make you warm and fuzzy.

Forgive my ignorance - but why aren't people arbitraging the difference between Gox and other exchanges?  Are you required to keep the coins you buy through Gox at Gox?

Ah yes, because every counter argument is anti-intellectual and every innovation is successful. Surely the innovator is always right, and those arguing something different are backwater idiots hell bent on keeping the status quo. 
You are the one who setup the computer straw man. Obviously there were huge incentives to develop the computer. As you admit yourself, those incentives are lacking in bitcoins. The only incentive there is right now is to increase the price and therefore the wealth of early adopters.  Sounds more like a Ponzi scheme than a viable currency. 
And all of your wild ideas about the freedom of crypto currencies come crashing down as soon as governments increase regulations.

it makes look like a straight line.

Like how oil is down 60%+ from ath and 40%+ from 2014?   Is that the dollars fault now?
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:33:31
Yet everyone quotes it in fiat lol. That tells you what most people really care about. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:27:57
Except you could have invested USD in interest bearing securities. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:20:52
Sure but not to the extent or with the investor protections that come with standard security investing.

Not exactly the kind of “growth” one wants from a currency though. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:23:14
Right, but everyone thinks of crypto in terms of fiat basis. How widely it’s used doesn’t change that. The only way I see that changing is if volatility decreased to levels of a normal currency. Except that’s not what 99% of crypto “investors” want.  They want crypto to go to the moon, which is fine if you view crypto as a store of value but not a currency.

this is so wrong on so many levels.  unless you are doing a LIKE KIND EXCHANGE, the gain is recognized.  This hahameto shows how you can't trust twats on the internet for tax advice.  The IRS would view bitcoin and gold as a like kind exchange since conversion rates are different.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:41:50
convert bitcoins to $, use $ to buy 3d printer.  not that hard.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:33:02
not when he puts a timeframe on his prediction
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:24:26


BitCoin cannot become widely accepted unless the volatility goes down.

the japanese stock index peaked in **1990**.  20 years later and it's still almost 60% off its high:   
My point is, it's often faulty logic to hold assets after a bubble pops thinking the asset is going to recover back to the pre-bubble valuation.

i'm sorry, but the fundementals of bitcoin do not include a $220:1 price.  At least not anytime in the near future.
