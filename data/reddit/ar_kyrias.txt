Feels bad man
3 days to add Coinbase on my bank account then 2 more days to go before my account being verified.
I'll just stay there watching it rise to the moon and stay on earth with my tears and bitterness...

Yup did that

The address seems fine, maybe it comes from Electrum and it takes some time to sync to the network?

I don't mind buying an ATH, I'm in on the long term so I don't really care about loosing few euros now.
Is there a way I could add funds now so I'm able to buy a potential dip during the day?

OK thanks for your help!
Quick question, I basically want to invest about 2k in crypto and then hold. For now I put about 350$ in BTC, should I go for alts? Wait for BTC to evolve?
I'm a complete newbie to crypto, I didn't want to miss this drop but I'm not sure what to do now

Ok thanks for all these infos!

Thanks! I'm planning on putting a bit more money soon into BTC, I would like to buy during this supposed fork but if Coinbase goes off on BTC during it, where could I buy some? (I'm from EU).
Should I buy LTC then trade for BTC as trent told me above or is there an other way to do so?

I just copied it to the clipboard, also tried using the QR code from my phone, doesn't work neither.
I'm not in a hurry and the amount I bought is pretty small as I'm expecting Bitcoin to drop a bit more (planning on buying more then but didn't want to buy none just in case it goes up instead of down), so I might just wait a bit then.

Thanks God, they can't print money whenever they want ! That would be fucked up right ? Right ?
