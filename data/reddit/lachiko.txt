it's not really a lottery ticket it's still useful even if it fails at mining it becomes your new gaming machine, it also fits the definition of a "real investment in technology".
So yeah it's definitely easier to convince someone to purchase something real than something virtual.
Virtual goods requires research and understanding what it is and how it works and why it's worth buying.

Why must be change his statement? There was nothing dumb about it that's what he believes to be the case, unfortunately it appears to be the most likely outcome.

Ah sorry no I've only tried to access the site, bitstamp has been dead for about 7 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:31:25


For a moment there i forgot what thread i was in.
This is good advice though we need to determine exactly how his machine crashed, it is far too vague.

What would the difference be? are you referring to a metro/modern app?
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:12:15
I may take another look I dont really want to send id + bank statement to bit stamp there is no telling how shady they are I can't really trust them to not commit identity fraud in the future
Edit: seems they only accept US bank accounts

I'm not sure exactly how chrome stores your remembered passwords but they are clearly available for anyone to see.
Settings -&gt; Managed saved passwords under passwords and forms.
can select them and click "show"
people have flipped their shit about this but google does not care they provided their reasoning and why it wouldn't change some time ago
I'm not sure if the option exists to store these passwords in an encrypted form using your account details but i don't think they care too much about security these days especially considering how adamant google it is at keeping you logged in on the browser

It's fun sitting here watching all the changes and i can't even buy any.
Also where are you seeing $25 for ltc?
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:48:11
Where did you buy from?
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:56:38
I agree seeing how slow they are to respond (understandable but still annoying) and if they are somewhat dodgy helps me decide if i want to waste my time with them or not.
dodgy referring to cases like this, i'm curious to see how it is handled or if they plain just don't give a shit.

You can keep generating a new one.
Have these brain keys been proven to be secure?
12 words, how large is the dictionary they are using?

That was only to counter the appearing somewhere else argument but it appears electrum does this automatically for you, according to Gibybo.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:25:10
It started working again handled a few transactions then died~
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:54:08
btce down to $408 dropping rapidly
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:29:34
How exactly has your computer crashed?
What have you tried what is it currently doing etc
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:19:34
BTC should still be the default, at least the option to switch back is available hopefully that option remains. mBTC just seems crap in writing and pronounciation as if it has had no real thought put into it.
even the following seem like better candidates than bitcoin/milli-bitcoin
bitcoin/bitcent (not that bad)
or hell
for all that is holy please don't use 1000k mBTC it's bad enough as it is 1,000 BTC or 1,000,000 mBTC or hell 1 MegaCoin (or 125 Byte Coins)

Same position with bitstamp started at $400 has been a while
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:22:37
Thanks, i've been tempted to use them but i'm quite wary of scams/being scammed I'll need to do a bit more research (I feel i've dropped the ball by attempting to use bitstamp as well but hopefully it pans out well).

I don't understand Truecrypt is working fine for me on windows 8.
What issues have you encountered?
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:38:19
in the console run
or right click the green - inspect element and press delete
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:35:30
I've encountered something like that before there is a slim possibility it's somewhere on the disk you can try a file recovery tool try to avoid writing to the disk as much as possible until you can run some tool (download the tool to another drive etc)
I'm not sure what free tools are available i've not had to use one for a while luckily perhaps someone else here can provide a decent tool
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:27:33
A week? damn i've been waiting 2 weeks just to get identified so i can then wait another week to put money in &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:52:17
Ah yes i see, thanks.
bit calculation for others
log(1626 ^ 12) / log(2)
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:58:53
Yeah i've been meaning to get into it for some time then i thought alright it's $400 i'll give it a go.
has since gone up to $900 then back down to $400 and back up to $800-850 again in that time span
There is also a good chance my bank isn't compatible with them either so i'll need to suss that out and determine if i want to find a new bank or not.
I currently have 82 cents worth of BTC thanks to the bitcointip bot here though so that's a start at least.

I assume he is mocking lite coin as it already exists
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:03:43
Bitstamp, it was showing a price of $488.
coinbase is currently working fine.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:10:46
How are these sites establishing trust with their users it just seems very risky as they appear to be able to take your bit coins and not pay you.
I mean you send your bit coins and hope that they pay you the amount they are worth and there doesn't seem to be anything forcing them to pay you other than ruining their credibility but if someone sells an excessively large number of bit coins who is to say they will pay out or just keep it to them self?
@_date: 2013-12-29 13:19:15
Ah fair enough I didn't think the operating system really had any influence at that time although I haven't looked into how truecrypt handles the whole disk encryption.
Thanks will have to read more into it later.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:44:23
Thanks, did it take long to setup coinjar? did you provide a photo id/proof of address and if so how long did it take for them to validate it?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:55:12
That doesn't really prove anything except you have or bought a piece of jewlery
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:42:43
It was offline before.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:51:05
Thanks, did it take long from signing up to actually being able to buy and did you need to provide ID? i don't think i can use them as i'm not in the US and bitstamp could take a week seems i'm out of luck here
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:08:39
That's sucky and not to be captain hindsight but you can at least take a lesson from it, if you're going to store your password in a file make sure you save it before applying the changes.
Is there no possibility to remember it or any chance of an old backup with your private key?
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:38:00
Congrats on receiving your funds I wasn't expecting this to pan out well for you given the behaviour of some users in the community.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:11:21
Congrats on the acquired knowledge, might I ask where did you end up purchasing the coins from?
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:01:36
It was up a few moments ago and has just gone down it may come back up soon though.
