Why is a false transaction seen as valid in block 1 but then invalidated in block 2 and beyond? I'm having trouble understanding that part.

This seems like the best answer and I thank you for it.

Coinbase doesn't do that. Lawyers do. 
Fire...did you ever consider hiding a paper wallet in multiple locations?

Sounds like you've been Fooled by Randomness
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:30:47
Yep, I get that. Surprised the list isn't 10,000 words just for sport, though.
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:24:32
Interesting. So the word list is not comprised of the complete dictionary, but actually a very small subset. Am I reading that correctly?
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:22:28
I know. But I'm curious to learn the methodology used to generate these "random" phrases.

If you give the news any weight at all, this is very good for any established coins, namely BTC, ETH and LTC. ICOs dilute the value of established coins. 
Money wants to flow into cryptos, whether governments like it or not. Less places to put your money means upward pressure for the true currencies. It's also great news for anything coming out of Russia due to the US and Chinese restrictions. 
I'm American, so this isn't shilling, but it looks like Russia is going to lead the way in cryptos for a long time to come.

Not true. And ether has the support of Russia while China and the US are busy banning ICOs.

I've done this.  Gave a friend's daughter .25BTC for her first birthday.  She's 2 years 9 months now.  That's a hefty gift :-)

I agree and this is a great thing.
The potential impact of the ETF is very overstated. Everyone cites the gold ETF GLD, which I believe was instituted in the early 2000s. This decade also coincided with a huge increase in gold's price. Correlation or causation?
A gold ETF is very logical and absolutely brought in new money.  1 gold futures contract on the CME is a huge contract size, something like 5000 oz per contract (yes, I know there are minis. But few have a commodity brokerage account).  Gold takes up space. It's difficult to store and is usually insured at cost.
Bitcoin is a not a legacy commodity. It's fractional to 8 decimals, so casual investors can already buy a very small amount. It's free to store and doesn't require insurance, so long as you're mildly technical.
A Bitcoin ETF will not bring in new money. The financial markets landscape is much more sophisticated than it was in 2003.

Draper paid more than spot price, and in an unusual situation where the U.S. Marshalls suddenly had a ton of BTC to sell.  Who's the OTC seller in your hypothetical scenario?

From here on out in your life, you'll make most decisions without your parent's approval and consent. This might feel unsettling at first, but soon this will be routine. This story seems like a good place to start.

You can short futures on an exchange like Bitmex. You'd still be holding, but you'd be offsetting your price risk by using a contract to hedge. And you'd be circumventing the need to pay taxes. Your rationale doesn't make sense.
