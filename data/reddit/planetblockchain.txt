HODL. If you bought when it was high, bailing now isn't going to do you any good.

I wouldn't say it amplifies deceitfulness, potentially facilitates it, but this stuff was happening before just with cash or strip clubs posting "ABC Financial Services" on card bills

Oof that's worrying! It doesn't matter how good a plan a coin has in place, there's always an element of gambling and we ALWAYS say only invest the money you can afford to lose
