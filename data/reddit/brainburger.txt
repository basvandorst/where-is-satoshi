Care to explain?

I'm pretty sure it will go down again fairly soon. It might go up further in the long term. Be aware of the risk.

At the moment people are buying and selling Bitcoin because it has volatile value and money can be made. Traders want to make profit in other currencies, not Bitcoin itself. That needs to change for BTC to be used as a currency to buy goods. It needs a stable value for that, which will reduce it being traded as now. 
I think the success/fail question being asked is whether Bitcoin can displace fiat currency and become used for purchasing and payments in a mainstream way. I don't think he literally means it should not be an option to sell it, but that it should not be something one would want to do.
No one seems to be denying the points you are making there, but if BTC is still traded like now in 2040 then it's not a good sign for its purpose having been achieved.

How much is a large amount these days? Is it the number of coins or the value in national currency?

It's been a few years since I saw anyone -even from the music industry- espousing your ideas.

Too small for an American to bother eating?

How would you physically make the bitcoin payment in a real-world setting like that?

Can I ask how much you have invested?

If hypothetical person pulls a gun and announces they are about to shoot you, its ok to shoot them first. The acts of shooting are not morally equivalent.

That's a good point. Its as though a person pulls out an unloaded gun, which you know they believe to be loaded, but which you know to be unloaded. There would be a certain satisfaction in shooting them, but not the solid justification which I implied.
