But you can mine Ether and it's causing the demand for high end GPU's to outpace supply. This, higher prices for gamers.

Please read my prior post on what I do with the hoard I've collected since 2012.


Seeds work regardless of what actually happens to the Trezor device.

Or, just pay $129 for a Trezor.

I hear you and appreciate the info on RNG. I guess I need to look into that more.
I think this is far less risk than holding with a 3rd party like the one advertised on the internet. Plus, at $60/yr a safety deposit box isn't that expensive and I like knowing I cannot be forced at gunpoint to turn over my funds.
I do keep ~7BTC at home on a Trezor for gambling and any other potential uses.

$166,667 per second ($5M for a 30-second buy).

No, by **Globalist** you meant **Jew**. 
It’s a blatant dog whistle that’s well known.

Yeah, my wife and I have had this talk. It's come down to seeds are in the bank safety deposit box along with most valuable Trezor and written instructions on what to do if I die.

And put it where? In your house? Good luck with a fire or a breakin when people know it's there.
I guess I'm not as paranoid as you and if my bank accesses the box without my permission (only I have a key and they need to drill it to get in), then we have a contract that would allow me to sue for significant damages.
Banks do not have the means to just open safety deposit boxes. If the customer looses the key, or the bank cannot find the customer, then the lock is drilled and it's obvious that it was tampered with.

It's a box in my private bank's safe that I pay to rent. Like anything the contents could be accessed by a court order from the government. But, that would require a judgement against me and the same scenario would apply if I kept the private keys in my house.
Edit: I don't declare the contents and the bank has no clue what's in the box.

This isn't real. It's a delusion person who hasn't accomplished much wanting 15 minutes in the limelight. 
This 'hack' and $40m in stolen coins would have been discussed in the community and the wallet would have been on the top of
