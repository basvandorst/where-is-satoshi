They don't steal your money when they ban your account. They just tell you to move your funds to a new wallet and you can no longer use their service.
Banks in the real world do the same thing when they ban your account, stealing your money is illegal.

Just saw the email come across about the update and have to say I love the new UI / design decisions. I’m a bit sad about the removal of the “spare change”, but after reading your blog and the reasons behind it I can completely understand why you had to do this.
The “easter egg” within the new portfolio section that you’ve added is great, I won’t spoil it for other people to find but I can’t wait for those to be live!
Really love what you guys have done with the app and am looking forward to new features coming soon.

You can't sign up with the app, seems like they didn't do much testing before pushing this out. 
Connect with Facebook --&gt; Enter Pin --&gt; Confirm Pin --&gt; popup "No Internet Connection"
Try same steps again, App crashes. 
Re open app, prompted with screen to "Enter Pin", enter your pin you set the first go around, doesn't authenticate, so you are stuck. 
Might want to use some of that 14 Million raised to do some more thorough testing.

It has absolutely nothing to do with price movements, this is a flag due to their fraud detection software and not some le conspiracy theory Redditors with no idea how a financial institution operates always believe it is.

Plenty of companies offer different tiers of support for their products, I do not pay for the premium tier at all and have always been impressed with how prompt and thorough the responses have been. Never really been an issue here! I even will reach out with feedback from time to time and Patrick (CTO) is always open for a conversation!

Long time Lawnmower user here, they definitely are still very much entrenched in the Bitcoin scene, the Pivot was just in the method and features surrounding purchasing / investing into Bitcoin. They did not move away from that premise at all.
Also, if you are having problems with your account, you mentioned something about not getting your money? I've never had a single bad experience reaching out to their support team, always super prompt and quick resolutions.

This sorta sounds like  I think they are sending out invites to an open beta soon. Sort of a link your spending to your savings idea.

Using Lawnmower is the same thing as using Coinbase but with additional functionality on top. So its a win/win situation, there is no downside.

This won't work and never would have, buying Ether post hard fork and transferring it to Poloniex they are not going to credit your account with ETC. 
Not sure if owner of this twitter just doesn't understand how this all works or what.

I can let you know how I use it. 
Basically whenever I buy from Coinbase the only thing that you get to see is your total bitcoin purchased / sold, and how much that Bitcoin is worth right now. 
They don't have any additional stats, or charts, or metrics that would help users understand how their investment is going. They also don't have any information about Bitcoin or other assets, it's just you either want to Buy, or Sell. Basically they are acting more as a Bitcoin bank than a full investment platform. 
I had been looking for a long time for something that combined all the features of my Fidelity account, but for the crypto space, and it looks like that is what Lawnmower is currently becoming. 
Hope that helps!
