Because in this context, pushing an error to Bitcoin Core won’t cost you your high paying job, it might not even revoke your access to the codebase. Not discovering it won’t either. The reliance is on the community to secure each other’s fortunes with no pay.

And why that analogy doesn’t work here is because programming OSS is a collective, benevolent effort. People are paid to do all the other things you mention. Bugs don’t just cost you personally, they matter collectively.

Terrible analogy, rockets are made by companies or governments with clear authoritarian structure and accountability. 
OSS *relies* on good community spirit and co-operation. Bug disclosure is a benevolent activity. Don’t forget that. The developer who discovered that bug could have crashed Bitcoin instead and this is clear proof.

Can you expand on this?

Maybe you’re right, demand for Bitcoin might well increase. But the overall market would take a huge hit. 
The entire market is almost completely driven by sentiment and news. Tens/hundreds of millions (of dollar value) could disappear from the market overnight, which would have a devastating impact on sentiment, setting adoption back for a long time. 
Exchanges using tether would also face huge black holes in their books and probably have to cease trading at least temporarily. Think how much those exchanges hold.
It would be interesting in that big bear market how long hashrate could be sustainable too at a b/e price of $6-7k if the price were to fall to $3-4K or lower.

Tether could be the Trojan horse that regulation heavy governments and critics all over the world have been waiting for. The story that crypto destroys itself from the inside is better than any governmental intervention. 
It failing would *completely* destroy Bitcoin’s value (think mining profits) and relegate it to the “was a nice idea” pile of human innovation.
This is the real battle, replacing the dollar, whilst relying on it.
