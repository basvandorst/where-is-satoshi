Then the amount of "clean" bitcoin will continue to drop. Until you end up with vastly more tainted coins than government approved ones.
The government approved ones might increase in value at that point, because you can use them to pay taxes or buy things from businesses that are dumb enough to require them.
And if they are more valuable nobody will spend them on illegal stuff, instead they'll buy normal bitcoins for that purpose.
At which point you effectively have two separate currencies running on the same blockchain. Bitcoin and whiteBitcoin.
It'll be stupid and pointless. And I think enough people will realize that it's stupid that it will never really take off.

Well that doesn't mean your not verified, it just means the code your Yubikey is giving them doesn't match what they were expecting. Try again?
Maybe if that doesn't work, go to the security settings and make sure your yubikey is still linked. If it's asking for a One Time Pass it seems like you must have a google authenticator linked as well.

Fair point. But nobody is talking about why freedom fighter organizations running underground in germany can't accept credit cards. 
The reason the local pizza joint doesn't accept credit cards on a tablet has nothing to do with the difficulty in complying with the credit card providers terms of service and more to do with tax evasion.

Stop trying to support the currency through altruism.

I'm honestly a bit torn on whether I'd rather have gold or bitcoin during an economic collapse.
There's really no question that gold will still be valuable. But if I bought gold bonds, they'll be useless. If I own gold but it's stored in another location by a third party, that's probably useless. If I own gold in my house, it might be seized or stolen.
Bitcoin has none of those problems. But there's also the possibility that nobody will value it, or internet access will be so difficult to reliably access that nobody will be able to use it.
Why not both?!

Oh my yes. If you have USD in Gox the choice seems obvious.
If you have $220 in gox right now and your account is authorized. Buy 2 goxcoins with it, send them to bitcoinbuilder, trade them for 1 real btc and sell it on another exchange for $580.
You're out of Gox's grasp and you just turned a significant profit. ^(Of course if you think Gox is going to let you withdraw bitcoins soon, then spend that same $220 on goxcoins and keep them there until they turn into 2 shiny bitcoins.)
Basically if you are holding USD in gox right now you're dumb and should stop.

I can think of a couple uses for this. 
Price seems fair. I'd recommend increasing the size of the QR code during payment, I had to zoom in with my browser before it was big enough for my phone to focus on it correctly.

It already is. If they're doing what I think they're doing (scanning a qr code using a laptop webcam) they're using one of the least effective means of transferring data available to them.
They could have instead emailed the code, put it on a thumb drive or made a tinyurl with a link to the code.  
Or at the very least, taken a picture of the qr code with their phone and then displayed that for the other laptop so that they didn't have to hold a laptop upside down pointed at another monitor.
I think maybe they just thought it would be fun to scan a qr code. Which it kind of is.

Hmm. Might be even better. But I'm not a fan of having separate lines of credit for a bunch of different stores.

Electrum works best for me.
I use it for both daily purchases and cold storage.
**For cold storage** I ran the client from a thumbdrive on an offline encrypted laptop I had laying around and generated a wallet. I memorized the 12 word key and created a view only wallet from that.  
Now I can keep tabs on my balance and create receive addresses using any old malware infested computer without worrying about my coins being stolen. And if that laptop dies or gets stolen, no big deal, I can recreate the wallet from anywhere in the world using the 12 word key I memorized.  
I could literally travel naked to another country with no ID and gain access to my cold storage bitcoins from any computer, so long as I remember the 12 words.
**For daily use** I just run the electrum client on my desktop like I assume the average user will do. That wallet only has a maximum of 2 bitcoins on it at a time. It's important that I keep this computer free of malware and keyloggers. 
I also use Mycelium on my android phone. But I never put more than 500 mBTC on it, because I'm honestly not all that familiar with Android security. So I figure they could be stolen at any point.

The difference with bitcoin is that you actually have that option.
You CAN be your own bank, but that doesn't mean you have too. 
This service seems like it would be really useful for the non tech savvy. A waitress could use it with very minimal training. It's easier than a standard credit card terminal in many ways.
That being said, I would personally not use this service. Because I know enough about it that I don't have too. But if I had employees who needed to accept bitcoin for me, I'd totally have them use something like this.

There are not a lot of options because of the high probability of fraud.

Probably that the "bitcoin accepted here" sticker was fake.
It just looks off because it appears to be crooked. The front of the sticker is farther from the bolt line than the back of the sticker. But I think that's because the rectangular piece of metal it's bolted too isn't actually rectangular.

You are correct about the logical conclusion we can draw from the fact that there are currently no counterfeit bitcoins. Just because a thing has not happened yet does not mean it will never happen. 
However you may be interested to learn that it is actually impossible to counterfeit bitcoins by design. Every bitcoin is traceable in the public ledger back to it's original creation when it was mined. Any bitcoin that has no history, or conflicts with the ledger cannot be included in the blockchain.
You would need to create a fake blockchain to create a fake bitcoin. And then get everyone to accept your fake blockchain.
Thus it is impossible for bitcoin to be counterfeit.

Good service, but the current prices are madness.
Right now 1 coin stuck on Gox is worth $110.
1 coin anywhere else is worth $580
So 1 goxcoin should be worth 0.2BTC
But people are buying goxcoins on bitcoinbuilder for 0.5 bitcoins. . .  ?!
Now I see that it is still a lucrative investment if you're fairly certain Gox will someday allow bitcoin withdrawals. 1 bitcoin for 2 goxcoins is pretty decent if a month from now those 2 goxcoins turn into 2BTC. But if mtgox says you're screwed, you're screwed.
If you're willing to bet 1 bitcoin that MTgox stays open for 2btc reward. Then this site is for you!
I'd be willing to take the bet if the goxcoin price dropped closer to 0.3btc

Are you holding the coins or not? The other posts led me to believe you were instantly converting the bitcoins into USD. Now you're holding them. What you do with the coins should influence your policy.
*If you are treating the coins as a glorified gift card* and converting them to USD at checkout, then treat them like a gift card.  
IE: When I go to buy a fridge that costs $600, I give you 630mbtc, I am then immediately granted $600 in store credit. So I'm buying the store credit, not the fridge. I then spend my store credit on the fridge. If at any point I want to return the fridge, I am refunded my $600 as in store credit.  
Maybe if you're really generous you'll let me convert my in store credit into bitcoin at the current rate. But that's totally up to you, just like gift cards are nonrefundable, in store credit is as well.
*On the other hand if you are holding the bitcoins*, treat it like a currency. I'm not buying a fridge for $600, I'm buying a fridge for 630mbtc. If I decide to return the fridge you give me back my 630mbtc. No matter the exchange rate, because you've been holding them any changes of price won't cause you any harm or gain.  And if you're worried about people returning the fridge a few days later because the price shot up, then in your return policy you can have a 20% restocking fee if the return is not your fault.
Those are two totally different ways of treating bitcoin. It's up to you which one fits your business model best.

You are offering a refund on a transaction that is irreversible. You must understand that this is entirely your decision.
If you said: *"No refunds"* there's really not a whole lot they could do about it outside of a court battle. They can't charge it back or put a hold on it.
Just because you are willfully giving up one of the benefits of accepting bitcoin doesn't mean the benefit doesn't exist.

Try transferring some bitcoins from one wallet you own to another, watch how quickly it says you have pending coins. That's how quickly it was announced the network.
At that point, those coins are as good as yours for small transactions. 
After it's announced the first confirmation comes when that transaction is first included in the blockchain, and another confirmation comes with each block after that.
Now here's my understanding as far as double-spending scams. I could be wrong so someone would have to correct me: 
In order to reverse a transaction with no confirmation, the attacker would have to mine the next block without your transaction being recorded, and instead with a transaction sending the coins elsewhere. 
In order to reverse a transaction with just 1 confirmation, the attacker would have to mine the previous block without your transaction being recorded, and instead with a transaction sending the coins elsewhere. Then he'd have to mine a second block to make sure his got accepted instead of the real one. Frankly if your attacker can consistently mine two blocks in a row he's probably not going to use this power to steal a sandwich.

Your reason is flawed. You are concerned about how the action is perceived and what it does to Bitcoin's public perception. However there are really only two options.
Option A: OP Takes the money and donates it to charity.  
Effect: Public perceives some Bitcoin being stolen, then later donated to charity with the original owners permission.
Option B: I steel the money and keep it.  
Effect: Public perceives some Bitcoin being stolen.

You're unlikely to find anyone willing to accept a visa gift card for bitcoins.
Imagine you purchased the gift card with a stolen credit card.  
Then you trade the gift card for bitcoins.  
Then the credit card company reversed the transaction and the gift card is useless and toxic.  
How does the guy who sold you bitcoin get his money back?
Same goes for Paypal, personal cheques etc.
A money order should be ok. But you can't buy a money order with a visa gift card for the same reason.

Barely upvoted?  It's on the front page of r/bitcoin. Not only this post, but nearly every day the front page has some new dumbass who didn't take basic steps to protect his money and loses everything he had stored in an online wallet without 2fa using the same password as his facebook account or something.
They get plenty of attention. If this one got any downvotes it's because we're sick of repeating the same basic security advice day after day.

Impossible to enforce.
I just made a new address. . . BAM, I just made another. ^(I didn't really, but pretend I did)
I can send money too it, you can send money to it. How can the IRS know who to prosecute for not registering it? They can see there's a new address, they can see someone sent it money. They might even be able to see WHO sent the money if it came from a registered address, but how can they tell who owns the new unregistered address?

Step 1: Buy 3D printer.
2: Download schematics to print new 3D printer.
3: Disconnect from the internet, line walls with aluminum and print a new 3D printer.
4: Use that new 3D printer to create a pen. 
5: Make your own ink using eggs, honey, gum and lamp black, or the soot from a candle. ^(Alternatively you can use blood, but only from a non-intelligent animal. Otherwise it could have been modified.)
6: Using a ruler, hand copy the Barcode.

There's nothing wrong with saving money. The ability to put off present pleasure for greater future pleasure is a necessary part of a successful person.


And you'd rather spend USD? I don't understand what that changes? Assume the pizza costs $20 or 0.02 bitcoins.  
If you think those bitcoins could be worth more tomorrow you may be tempted to buy the pizza with dollars instead.  But those same dollars could be used to buy bitcoins.
If you have $20 laying around that you haven't bought bitcoins with, that's just as bad as spending the 0.002 bitcoins on a pizza.

Yes, the moment your transaction is announced to the network you're done. Your computer is just watching for confirmations at that point.
If you included a transaction fee you can expect a confirmation in about 10 mins. If you didn't include the fee it could take a few hours. Regardless, it's going to go through.
You can see its progress by typing in the transaction id or the receiving bitcoin address here:

Are you aware that when you spend some of the money on the paper wallet, all the remaining coins get sent to a change address? This is important and apparently not everyone knows about it. So if you spend a bit of your coins directly from the paper wallet and don't know how to access the change address, you could have some problems.

Because there is effectively no effort involved. In the case of the stone coins on the Isle of Yap, if we're going to use my intentionally ridiculous example, the natives just agree that this coin belongs to Wikipedia. There's no paperwork, you just say: "I accept it"
You don't know how many donations in that currency you will get, so if somebody donates $5 worth of a single rock, yeah there's probably no good way of cashing that out, nothing lost nothing gained. But if someone donates a substantial amount, then it's worthwhile to use it.
In the case of Bitcoin, you literally just generate an address and paste it on your website. If someone donates $0.12, then just don't use it, maybe in a few years it'll be worth cashing out. On the other hand if you get a substantial amount, then what have you lost by accepting it?

I'm going to go ahead and assume you're not an idiot, but still point out the obvious with step 6.
You took a photo of the paper wallet. If you used a regular old-fashioned digital camera for this, no worries. But if you used a phone you may be at risk if it gets hacked or stolen or borrowed. Also gotta make sure all the privacy settings are good, you don't want your photos folder to automatically sync with your Facebook account or something similarly dumb.

There has never been a 24 hour period in which bitcoin raised in price by 1,000%
You don't have to worry about your lunch costing as much as a TV by the time you get home.
And even if it did, unless you just spent your last .01 bitcoin on the sandwich, you're probably more excited about the 1000% increase in your remaining coins worth than the loss you couldn't have predicted.
Disregarding all that, it's really no different if you spend the bitcoin on a sandwich or you spend $5 on the sandwich. If you spend $5 on the sandwich and then the price of bitcoin rises 1000%, will you not be kicking yourself for spending $5 on a sandwich instead of buying bitcoin with it?

1: It's a currency. If you can't spend it quickly there's no point.
2: Even if you just view it as a store of value, what if you run into hard times and need to liquidate some of it? Say you wreck your car and need to get a new one quickly for example. Do you really want to take out a loan and have to pay interest for a few months because you can't access your bitcoins?
And what benefit do you gain by having it unavailable for months? If I can only think of one good reason to have it handy and there are 0 good reasons to have it unavailable then I should keep it handy.
You yourself provided a good reason to have it handy, but you didn't provide a reason not too, aside from proving that you *'really believe'* in it's stored value. Not everyone needs to have a religious dedication to their currency.
