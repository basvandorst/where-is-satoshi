Looks good, been watching the fallout today with it. I'll definitely keep up with this.

You treehugger types get in your own way.
Now to explain bitcoin I guess. It is a deflationary currency, meaning over time it gets harder and harder to mine until there is no more to mine. Soon the only point of mining will be transaction fees. Then you supply and demand until mining is only barely profitable. Until then btc's electricity usage will set all kinds of records as far as energy consumption by computing goes.
Iceland is a fucking sparsely populated volcanic nature preserve, it could produce a shitton more energy with current geothermal technology, it just has no need to.
What happens when the rest of the third world wants A/C? Are you gonna tell them "no you'll hurt the environment"? 
USE OF ENERGY =/= POLLUTION

Well they do, the main thing you don't want is them running 100% the whole time. That's how you burn them up, its a direct short through the motor. 50-75% sustained and you'll be fine. 
This goes for all electric motors. I never turn the HVAC fans in my vehicles on high and I've never replaced a blower motor.

Confirmed FUD, fuck off.

Thats one that undergrad computer architecture left out. Need to do more research...

I'm installing a few of these bad boys next winter. Who needs a traditional water heater or heat pump? Just mine as needed and not feel at near as bad about your electricity bill in the cold months. Can't wait for the future, the hash rate will go nuts every winter in the northern hemisphere.

Big if true

I don't see how that's possible given the design of the clip. It has to print downward to form the clip.
I believe you, I'm just interested in how it's accomplished. Trick with the surface tension and set time maybe?
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:26:03
Thats the way the markets work. You have makers and takers. You can't place a limit buy order above market price because you'll wind up only having takers. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:53:44
I don't think you can print a clip like that, and if you can it wouldn't last long.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:47:00
I hope it hits like 6k again. Can't wait to buy more
@_date: 2018-05-19 05:43:30
Absolutely, if we don't start seeing a bitcoin sticker beside the paywave sticker on CC terminals we will fail.
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:49:41
I love these "explanations" like if you did know what was happening it would change anything.
BTC was ~2k this time last year. Yeah you bought in at 15k, tough shit. Figure out what you've "lost" and buy at least that much all the way down.
More than likely you'll be laughing all the way to the bank this time next year.

That article doesn't say production or consumption. You can believe what you want, the rest of us know bullshit when we see it.

Does it print on it's side? 
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:13:45
It won't hurt it. I doubt you'll even burn up a fan. Electric motors are pretty bulletproof nowadays and the gpu itself will last forever as long as you don't overclock it.
My 9800gtx(2008) was humming along nicely until I replaced it a few weeks ago. It spent a few months mining back in the glory days.

So you think power plants run at 100% capacity 24/7?
.5% of total usage is an impressively low number.
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:16:48
We aren't brilliant we just think critically about headlines and do our own research on them. 
Numbers by themselves do not mean anything. Look up how much electricity it takes to run a HVAC systems across the world. Think about how much power it takes to run just the exterior lights in places like las vegas. Compare that usage to the capacity of the individual regions, then you'll see where the energy is "wasted"
Think critically, or get roasted. This debate should never have happened because to the people who can comprehend it, these questions are FUD.
Also r/Bitcoin does not represent the bitcoin community as a whole. If this is your only or go-to source, you've already lost money.

I can't even your post.
It's traceable in the way that you hide in plain sight. You have to track the coins as they move through the wallets, watch for transactions between wallets. Unless you attach your name/face/ip address to a wallet you are pretty much untraceable.

Pretty much all inventions start out as useless until we put them to use. Whats weird is that in my journey through compsci curriculums, blockchain seems like a fairly obvious data structure to have been invented so late. Especially since the rise of cryptography happened pretty much parallel to computing.
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:04:47
Downvotes are saying these folks don't know how to make money. 
I'd be estatic at 4k.
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:54:48
Not a professional by any means. I have to show a point of failure before I can get a replacement part. When it's a fan motor that goes bad, usually it's because the cooling system was overheating or the A/C is out and the fans are running full speed trying to keep up.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:55:39
It's in your hands. I could spin up a new wallet in a few seconds and bounce around the contents of my old wallet enough to hide it for a few hundred Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:21:12
You've never heard the use of "credits" as currency in a scifi movie? Yeah, you can go ahead and change that to crypto mentally.

I believe we're all truly middle roaders on the inside. The actual problem is we either invest spare change or max out credit cards.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:52:55
Remember folks, there is no such thing as bad publicity. The lower the price goes, the more it makes the news, the more people remember it's meteoric rise, the more buyers we have.
 My original investment was $250. I pulled that out in December, nothing but profit from here on out regardless.
Edit for a deleted comment: If it's in the mainstream news, there's money in it. Bitcoin wouldn't be reported on if there weren't interested viewers.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:41:47
So when this gets rolling do we expect the opposite overnight reaction than whats currently happening?
