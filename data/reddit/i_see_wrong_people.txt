Pretty common at bars. Overserving guests can produce legal liabilities if those guests are involved in an alcohol-related accident. At least in Texas.

Why would anyone do that? It's just dumb. You could have bought on the open market, while simultaneously driving up the price. If he paid $800 a coin, he's a moron. 
If you bought 1/5 of those coins per week at market rates, on an exchange, you could have possibly driven the price to $800, and pocketed a nice gain. The way he did it is crazy bullish. Stupid bullish. If that's true, he's sitting on a giant pile of coin he paid too much for.

Fractional reserve banking is a favorite target of the libertarian types who currently populate It's not because they don't understand it. It's because it causes an emotional reaction in them that causes them to oppose it despite it working almost exactly as intended for about a century. Kinda like most things that people are vociferously against, their deep-seated fears are largely unfounded. 
  My prediction in 10 years: Fractional Reserve BTC Banking. Watch all their heads explode.
  Many of them have taken economics, too. They love to remind you of that.

No, the value of bitcoin is inflated. The bitcoin *economy* is experiencing deflation: when the value of money rises. The price of goods is typically the bellweather for an economy, (hence deflation, falling prices), not the currency itself (bitcoin, rising in value, inflating).
Hence, we call bitcoin a "deflationary currency" because it is currently causing deflation in the bitcoin economy, not becaue the currency itself is deflating.

$88M market cap, so they'd have to be some huge whales to manipulate it "100%".
I'd say it's more like 5% manipulated.

That's sad.... and dumb. I'm sure that other BTC early adopters have tons of altcoins as well.... I feel like the altcoin-hate-obsession in this community is a result of FUD.
I mean, if your bank allowed you to instantly and essentially freely transmit accounts between Euro and dollar, getting paid in one or the other really wouldn't matter for any practical purposes, provided relative stability.
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:25:24
Meh, this guy's stuff all sounds like someone who held BTC for too long, and is miffed about the rise of altcoins. 
Regardless of what you think, Dogecoin has a strong community, arguably stronger than Bitcoin, even if it's all fun and games.
Do you really think that the Euro must go to zero because it offers no utility over the dollar? Or the Dong?
Sorry, I just love that there's a currency called the Dong. Also, it's worth about 100 satoshi each, just like Doge. 
The reason that Doge is successful where others falter is that there are people who want it, people who buy it and people who spend it. Just like Bitcoin. 
Haters gonna hate. Whatevs. I hold way more BTC than Doge. I just like it, it's fun.

Who in hell would trade BTC for Bolivars? The fact that you can exchange them for anything mystifies me. 
Anyone with experience in this who wants to correct me I welcome to.

The invention of the world wide web was predated by decades of development in computer networks. I don't think it's a good place to peg the birth of the internet. ARPANET is a better example, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:07:51
It's a good argument, and you have good points. That said, the creation of the WWW seems a little late in the game for "birth of the internet". More like "Birth of the Modern Internet".
The reason I suggested Arpanet is because of the implementation of TCP/IP (1982), which is a protocol that underlies the modern WWW.

I guess that will eliminate bitcoin, just like drugs and torrents, which are completely impossible to obtain since the laws against them passed.

In 2003 Wells Fargo wouldn't open a checking account for me because one was already open tied to my SSN. I got it sorted out, but when I asked what would happen to whoever fraudulently used my identity to open a financial account they brushed it off and changed the subject. 
Fucking crooks.

That's exactly chasing endless growth. The only reason they are able to access these debt instruments is the institutional assumption of appreciation. 
Growth is the dynamic that allows the debt to exist. No one would lend otherwise.

Interestingly enough, this closely mirrors the international drug markets value against Gross World Product.
UN estimates the drug market to be worth 361 Billion USD in 2012
Nominal Gross World Product is estimated at 71.83 Trillion
Giving a ratio of 0.00502575525 or 0.5025%
I wonder if the government would see this as a legitimate reason to eliminate dollars and make their use illegal.
