Knowing that somehow down the road, Wall Street will find a way to co-opt the platform. Obviously they can't completely control it, but with the help of the US government, it is a near certainty that they will make sure the US enacts laws that give them dominance over the Bitcoin system in the US, from a legal perspective.
Bitcoin was created to counter that type of activity, but as someone who works in finance, I have seen what US banks are capable of, and Bitcoin will not go away, but Wall Street *will* find a way to profit from it at the expense of others through the generation of a legal framework, as opposed to a technology framework.

He's also a lying dirtbag who routinely commits blackmail &amp; extortion. Ask wall street insiders, he's as dirty as the rest of them but has possibly more political clout than Goldman, etc. He has done an absolutely *incredible* PR job of making himself look like your kindly old grandfather to regular Americans, for which I actually commend him for his aptitude (even though he will burn in hell for his crimes).
But if he's actively saying this, there is a very good reason (which will benefit him in the long term). Everything he says publicly is carefully crafted, and right now, only he knows why he is doing this (well, and possibly a few of his minions).

Yes, and we would often have a few different funds available to our clients with different risk profiles, some low risk, some market-neutral, and some high risk. If I still had my fund, I might consider adding a bitcoin position to my high risk fund.

As there is no precedent for something like this to reference, there is no real model. Everyone has developed their own based on their own educated guesses. It really *is* a true mystery, though more capital inflow typically moves the price up.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:52:38
There are too many variable to cite here (I'm in finance and an economist). But to rattle off a few:
1. Limited supply means if adopted, no inflation due to oversupply or "quantitative easing" type crap.
2. If it really *is* adopted, for transactions and micro-transactions, a small amount would have to be worth enough to enable its efficacy as a "currency." If a cup of coffee costs 0.001 bitcoins, circulation will be too tight. If a cup of coffee costs 150 satoshis, then the number of BTC can actually be of economic value as it could be spread around enough to maintain its stature as a "currency" without too much deflation.
3. To be an international "currency," it will have to be used all over the world, and there must be enough inherent value for it to be effective as a "currency."
4. As a store of value as well as a currency (e.g. like gold) the value of one bitcoin would have to support that type of market.
5. Wall Street and private equity has gotten very interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, and once that happens, they make sure their bets win, no matter what, so the impetus for it to succeed is backed by market and currency manipulators and people who have a vested interest in it succeeding and have the power to do so.
Each of those variables can be broken up into tens of others, so that's pretty much a 20K foot view to support a much higher value. Whether it will actually happen is anyone's guess, though. I make no assumptions, but have faith that it will continue to be used long enough to establish itself as, at the minimum, a secondary store of value in many markets. I would never assume it will be the end all be all of digital currencies, though who knows.
I will say that $10K by 2018 seems a bit far fetched to me, though, and if it happened, I would interpret it as a bubble and sell. It needs to maintain slow growth to work. Volatility is good for traders, but bad for the average joe who would be using bitcoin.

You need a big injection of realism. I find it interesting how you assume so much with no data. Don't get me wrong, I'm a bull and would love for them to be worth a million per btc, but as someone in finance I understand the laws of supply and demand quite well and limited supply doesn't mean high prices, it could also easily mean non-use. Also you make some pretty staggering assumptions with no data to back them, and with no analogue for btc, there is absolutely no way to draw any meaningful conclusions about the future of btc. Though I'll repeat I'd love to see your thoughts come true, I'd buy a Polynesian island.

I'm a retired fund manager and can say that I was never as excited participating in markets as I am in the bitcoin process. And as a bull from the beginning (I was always tech-oriented) trading around my core position has been both fantastically fun and lucrative. I agree that you can't compare the two. Bitcoin is an instrument I would never consider for my funds, but as a personal investment (versus putting my own money into my primary fund) the staggering returns I've seen impress me more than any ten-baggers I've had in my life. When I sold my fund and eventually left after my contract expired I wasn't sure what I was going to do. While I've done a lot of fun and interesting things since then, Bitcoin has brought the excitement back into my life in terms of investing and trading.

Actually we *want* bitcoin in our club, badly, and privately I and many, many fund managers I know own bitcoin. But the markets just aren't mature and transparent enough for the SEC to allow an ETF. I knew this was going to be denied, as are the other two. It's going to take some time, but I guarantee that Wall Street (me and my colleagues) *want* bitcoin to succeed because it's becoming a very interesting way to hedge without using physical commodities, and we see what the blockchain technology can do for the world. IMHO, bitcoin *will* succeed, but it's use that the markets aren't mature and trustworthy just yet. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:00:08
I'm not claiming that we can identify with 100% certainty every single person with every single transaction, but even with tumblers, etc, law enforcement agencies can track down the owner/user of almost every BTC transaction. The FUD that bitcoin is an "anonymous" currency that foments drug dealing, child pornography, and terrorism is completely unfounded. If you think you are so smart that you can use bitcoin with complete anonymity, you are very mistaken, and there are a million and one ways to track a person down. If you really don't believe that, please, by all means, use bitcoin for all your illegal activities and be prepared to learn the hard way.

@_date: 2017-03-20 16:53:29
Now *that's* just fucked up. was it a troll, or did they claim to have an actual reason for doing so? An how have they not been arrested for it? Contrary to media FUD, bitcoin/blockchain is *not* anonymous, and the person absolutely *can* be tracked down, and the blockchain proves they had it in their possession at some point. I'm curious now.
EDIT: I think people are missing my point. I'm not trying to make an absolute statement, I'm saying that, for the most part, whoever did this could be tracked down (and IMHO should be, as I and some immediate family have been victims of this kind of abuse so it's personal for me). I really don't care that "Satoshi" (who never really touched their coins after releasing Bitcoin unto the world) hasn't been identified, my point was that one cannot assume anonymity by virtue of using the Bitcoin blockchain. Pedantic arguments do nothing to back up or make moot my pint that whoever did this can most likely be identified.

GBTC isn't a true ETF. Silbert may want it to seemlike one, but it trades at a premium, and it's more like having a fund in your fund rather than a pure proxy instrument, like a gold ETF or Bitcoin ETF. Some funds are limited in the types of financial instruments they can buy (or short), and an ETF does away with all of that. The way my fund works, I'm allowed to buy anything (I had a Boston Market franchise in it many years ago, for example), so if I wanted, I could buy Bitcoin, but most fund managers don't have that kind of flexibility. An ETF also legitimized bitcoin in a way that fund managers won't have as much trouble justifying a Bitcoin ETF as they would if they simply bought straight Bitcoins in their fund. So a true ETF would really be the break out "killer app" for Wall Street, in terms of Bitcoin as a store of value (not thinking about blockchain specifically, which is a side issue to the ETF, though a brilliant one). An ETF would make it extremely easy to participate, basically.
Personally, I'd love to see an Ethereum ETF at some point as well as I believe that it actually is qualitatively better than Bitcoin, though BTC has the first mover advantage which it will never lose (at least not for the next few years), IMHO. Buuuuuut that's another side issue with plenty of contention. :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:22:10
This is 100% correct. I'm a fund manager, working in finance, and also a private bitcoin owner. This is exactly why the SEC will *not* approve any ETF for bitcoin in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:10:07
Holy crap, the FUD is strong with this article.
"On the contrary – the only reason Bitcoin has value to anyone is because of the underlying value as a medium of exchange for lawbreakers. If we could flip a switch and eliminate all illegal uses of Bitcoin, there would be nothing left of the cybercurrency."

If you haven't sold any (or used any to purchase something, or done something that legally constitutes as being a loss or gain event, you have nothing to report on your taxes. And, in fact, if you lost coins that you paid for, you can write the loss off on your tax returns (per IRS rules). If you lie to them, and they can prove it, though, you will be charged with tax fraud. But they would have to be able to identify the transactions and pin them on you.
Personally, I keep detailed records, but that's because I pay taxes on my capital events, and participate in the BTC world. If you don't have any, then you have nothing to worry about though. 
Of course, as with any tax filing, you should not take opinions from random people on reddit (like me) but contact a professional. I'm just explaining the situation as I see it.
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:48:16
Apples and oranges. They are only similar in that they create taxable events. So does every single other asset. They cannot arbitrarily decide that a random asset must be registered, or seek information about it when the law does not support their actions. If you honestly believe what you are claiming, you are the reason we are living in a police state that is getting worse and have no reason to complain if you are treated as a criminal without being one. Frankly, people like you scare me, happily giving up the rights many millions of people have died to protect. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:20:52
Precisely. But you can bet this won't be the end of it, the US is scared shitless of bitcoin, and because of that, China may eventually control it and the US will completely shoot itself in the foot.

So because your car is registered you should be OK that everything you own should be registered? That's specious logic.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:20:05
Yep. It's a "cover your ass" strategy that is going to get all its customers in trouble, and then piss them off. This could be the issue that kills Coinbase as a business (it should be because what they are doing could be constituted as knowingly providing fraudulent information on its customers to the IRS).
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:19:43
Well, I'm assuming you live in the US, and that means you do have a legal obligation to declare your gains on tax filings and pay your capital gains taxes, as much as it sucks to say. I saw this coming and have logged all my transactions so I have all my personal cost basis, but I'd be willing to bet that 95% of people haven't done this so they've got some work to do trying to dig up all their information and re-filing.
Again, I'll stress that if I were you I'd consult with a tax professional on this, but my personal opinion is that they are after people who have made thousands and millions of dollars and aren't declaring taxes on their bitcoin gains, and not people who used a few and may have made a little bit of money. It also may depend on *wen* you made these transactions. I don't recall when the law was enacted and if it is retroactive to all gains back to day one or not, but again, that is a question for a professional, so it's possible that if this was years ago, you *may* not owe anything, but that's speculation on my part as I let my accountant deal with all of this stuff.
One positive note is that the statute of limitations is 7 years, I believe, so if you have not been caught (which would be pretty hard if they can't be tied to you via credit card or Coinbase) after 7 years of getting away with not paying taxes, you don't have to pay them, but I personally wouldn't rely on that as an option. 
Perhaps not great news, but it's all I have, the IRS wants their share and as a government agency, they can be pretty nasty. 
Perhaps we should all take note from Scientology and every single bitcoin user (whether or not they used coinbase) should sue each employee of the IRS for harassment and get the issue dropped? That's how Scientology got their "church status." :)
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:01:24
Actually it's the business principle that I have huge problems with. I'm actually very conservative with my taxes, and if anything, over-report and under write-off (I'm a Swedish Socialist and believe strongly in paying taxes for the greater good). However if Coinbase is actually reporting any outgoing transaction as a sale to the IRS, then again, I disagree with that strongly and they are doing their clients a disservice (including legally), and I would encourage a class action suit against them in the US. If they want to create an ongoing concern, they need to work for their clients and not the government, and report properly, not fraudulently (fraud because they are knowingly reporting false information).

Thank you. It's bizarre how people so easily misinterpret simple things. But Reddit has all kinds, eh?
@_date: 2016-11-03 12:21:44
I have not for a few reasons. 
1. I'm comfortable enough from my finance days to not worry if I "lose it all" in my bitcoin holdings.
2. I've always told myself I'm in it for the long haul. My investment strategy is similar, with updates to my views as the market changes of course, but I actually do believe strongly in bitcoin and believe it will go much higher. But that is not a recoomenadtion for you to take any advice from me. I just want to see where it goes. ;)
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:53:01
Sure. I definitely feel sorry for the guy who paid 10K btc for 2 pizzas. He must be kicking his own ass today. Turning a few bucks into $7 million in a few years is something few bitcoin holders can claim. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 02:49:53
As someone who started a hedge fund and ran it for 15 years before selling it, I too am staggered at the gains I'm seeing with my bitcoin holdings relative to all my years of investing in various markets. From a risk perspective, bitcoin is completely insane, however the reward side is staggering.
I too became interested early and mined my first coins many years ago when it was easy on a single AMD card, and when the pools were no longer lucrative I just bought them for practically nothing (relatively speaking). 
If you had told me about bitcoin in 2000, I would never have believed it. I've always been a tech guy, but watching the growth on my position (which I intend to hold for at least another decade unless something *serious* happens to bitcoin) is something that the best money manager could never believe possible. I'm still floored, and humbled, at the risk/reward ratio as my biggest single asset dwarfs everything I've done in my life practically, and my cost was almost nothing, relatively speaking. For someone who spent 15 years studying companies, equity and bond markets, as well as every investment vehicle under the sun for my funds, this situation is really like the Twillight Zone. I almost don't believe it.

While you are absolutely correct, this is not the real reason the IRS wants this data. This is the "shot across the bow" for the IRS, and a way to try to scare big fish into reporting unreported gains. It's not really about Coinbase per se, it's about the IRS flexing its muscles, and sowing FUD in the bitcoin community. it will backfire, but US government agencies seldom think long term.

That's a rather arrogant position to take. I've had a 10 bagger in my time, but to watch something go from tiny fractions of a penny a few years ago to $730, it in fact *is* staggering and humbling to participate in. I think you need to learn some perspective and appreciate what hae happened.
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:48:46
I never participated in penny stocks, pink sheets were out of the question for me and always will be, so I'm not sure where you got that idea. I was all long/short growth and other vehicles not involving the markets.
But I'm not sure why you make so many staggering assumptions and also have no sense of perspective. I'm guessing you don't know much about science either. Are you on the spectrum perhaps? You talk like someone who has no sence of normal social conventions. But nevertheless, I'm done, and I honestly don't care what you wish to assume or not. I'm pretty happy with my life and have a healthy respect for everything in the world that is staggeringly beautiful, intense, and interesting. Your world must be a scary place.

Haven't seen it, so I can neither refute or confirm. But I find it interesting that people take TV anf films so seriously when they are entertainment made to make money, and the only things that are agenda driven are the Michael Moore documentaries.
TV shows have to make money or they go off the air. If you aren't dramatic and balls to the way, you will be cancelled. And then you get fringe weirdos who somehow believe that everything they see is a conspiracy while they wear their tinfoil hat.

It would be as if DeBeers suddenly took all the diamonds from their vaults that they keep to maintain perceived scarcity value and flooded the market. Diamond engagement rings would no longer sell for $20,000 but for $200. Not a good thing (and I'm a Bitcoin bull).

I look at Bitcoin in a similar fashion as credit cards. Did they change the way people use money? Absolutely. Did they replace money? While it almost seems they did, they didn't. 
Bitcoin is the same. It is a new process that will allow economic transactions to evolve. It won't destroy anything, remove anything (credit cards will still always be around in some form, they are another form of debt, which people use), and it is not a "killer app." But what it does is expand upon the existing infrastructure in ways that other systems do not, and for that, I believe it will carve out a large niche eventually.

Running my own NYC based hedge fund for 15 years and being deeply embedded in the finance industry for 25. It's a small world, and we all know each other at my level.

Exactly why this is complete BS. We also can transmute lead into gold via particle accelerators (or massive nuclear reactions), however the energy cost to create the gold would be prohibitive. This is the most nonsensical "news" I've seen in a while. I can't believe some people are eating it up.

80% of the US firefighter service is volunteer. I am a volunteer firefighter in my town as *some* people have the courage, strength, and desire to help others and are willing to assume great personal risk to do so. I've been a volunteer firefighter for about 10 years now and it is my proudest accomplishment, and brings me more satisfaction and happiness than all the companies I have started, sold, and/or run.
If you want to get off your ass and start helping your community instead of just being snarky on Reddit, I suggest you look into the fire service, unless you are afraid of fire, blood, or going above and beyond to help save the lives of the people in your community. When I die, I can honestly say I've lived a live of goodness and service to others and not been a selfish slave to consumption, mediocrity, and a general prick to others. I've quite literally saved the lives of men, women, and children, and sadly not been able to at times as well, which even though I know is not my fault, I feel deep regret and wish I could have. My actions reflect my ethics and personality, and I am a sincerely good person.
Can you say the same of yourself?

What Buffett says and what he does are mutually exclusive. The brand persona Warren Buffett is a very carefully crafted marketing image of the kindly old man. The person Warren Buffett is *exceptionally* different. 
If you have heard the quote "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he doesn't exist," this applies perfectly to Buffett. If you knew the things he does and believes outside his brand image, your jaw would drop. Those of us who run in his circle know the real man, but the last thing we want is to make him angry. You don't survive that well.
He's crafty and I'm certain his eyes are strongly on Bitcoin, and what he may or may not be doing in terms of involvement will only be released to the media when he is ready for the resulting effects to benefit him.

I was thinking along the same lines. If they are on an exchange or an Internet wallet (e.g. Coinbase, etc) then they hold the private keys and technically "own" the crypto. 
As an aside, It's so sad to see  the US go from the world superpower and bastion of freedom and democracy to the oligo-fascist power it is today. I feel really sorry for the Americans who don't have any other citizenship or power to get out before the dystopian fiction becomes a reality.

Robots have led to countless layoffs at manufacturing plants over the years, and thr robotics industry will eventually make most manufacturing jobs no longer exist. Evolution is the nature of systems and economies. So to your point, if credit card companies can't compete with the transaction costs, then any company that can offer the same security and protection with lower transaction costs, then the credit card companies will become obsolete. Or perhaps they will adopt Bitcoin themselves as a new methodology in their model? Many things can happen, and will, so I'm excited to see where it all goes. :)

I'm very interested to see what would happen if I removed the ads for a bit. I'm not saying people tip frequently, they don't, so ads will likely still pay the webhost for a while still, but it would be interesting to test it once BTC tips become more consistent. It's not that i'm getting a large volume of tips, more that the small tips I have gotten have grown in value since the tips. But hey, I'd love to have an ad free site operating on nothing but BTC tips. Being a bit on the paranoid side, though, and not trusting Google, I winder if they would ding the site at all for having no adsense ads (thus removing their ability to profit from my site) but having BTC on the site. It may sound crazy, but I wouldn't put it past them.

It's still early, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that I'm getting tipped. And I'd love to remove the ads as I always find them ugly, but would really like to earn a little bit to offset the server cost. What is even more exciting is seeing people actually using Bitcoin, though. Obviously if such a niche-y site can get tips, Bitcoin must be even more pervasive than I realized.

Would you mind sharing where you bought sushi with Bitcoin? I'm trying to keep track of all places that offer this here:

While obviously I use Adsense to monetize the site, I've recently started accepting Bitcoin tips and have made more in tips than I make with the adsense ads. If it continues, I may remove ads entirely, which would obviously make for a better user experience, and simply rely on Bitcoin for revenue generation. This site is not a big earner, I just have ads to pay for hosting, etc, but now it's helping me collect some Bitcoins too, which makes me really happy!
