I’m not trying to be rude to you but you need to be informed on something before throwing words like scam around. Use google and research yourself.

This video needs all the upvotes. Andreas is thought provoking as always. Great video

Short and sweet. I appreciate when people can get the point across in the shortest amount of words possible.

You’re a gentleman. We thank you!

You should strongly consider not dying.

You deleted “HAHAHAHA”. You realized how childish you sounded. I don’t need you to check on me. I have other things to worry about other than my investments on a week to week basis.

I don’t think most are debating the software/blockchain. I think people are saying that this is outright deception which could lead to angry investors who “didn’t know better” that we’re trying to buy bitcoin (btc). The same way people are being held accountable for bitconnect someone might have to be held accountable for deception on this exact website.

Is this setting him up for a lawsuit? It’s obvious that this is not in good faith. I don’t care for BCH, but I respect the idea of people wanting to fork btc because when there isn’t consensus that’s just how it works. But when you list bitcoin cash as bitcoin, it’s clearly deceitful and you could be leading people to invest in something they don’t want.

It’s next week. You were only 3k away from your prediction. Well played

All it takes is for people to invest in bitcoin cash, it hypothetically goes down a lot and now anyone that bought BCH from his website can say I thought I was buying bitcoin. It smells like a class action lawsuit if bitcoin cash doesn’t succeed

I would really like to hear the thoughts of the BCH camp. What do you guys think about the way BTC and BCH is advertised on this screenshot and on the bitcoin.com’s website. Please put your biased aside and talk to us like adults. The same way I’m trying to communicate with you all. Idk how to link bch or draw attention to this comment, but can someone that knows what they’re doing do something to let BCH see this so we can have a discussion?

I’m not saying someone will sue him, I’m saying that if he’s deliberately misleading people with their money it’s seem like a recipe for a lawsuit
