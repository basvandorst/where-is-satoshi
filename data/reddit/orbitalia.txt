good find

Ethical reasons, I saw the drug dealers and the dodgy porn merchants getting in and I decided there and then it wasn't for me, and now as it becomes mainstream I think the value is going to fluctuate wildly anyway..

Bitcoin is open source, but I am a bit concerned that it actually is against US and European law to export Encryption Software (ECCN classed 5D002). Do you not worry about the legal aspects of exporting such software?

Right, "is still" but back then with its connection to the crimnal world, i didnt want to end up on watchlists for professional reasons

Seems like my comment was quite prescient considering the recent events in China.

Indeed. IBM has always had a policy of using Integers to represent money. If they want to understand why just read this article

I think some people are seeing it as an illegal way to transfer funds over national boundaries. Governments typically do not like this, they will step in sooner or later.
I have actually been following bitcoin since day one, but I don't own a single uBTC, I feel very stupid about this, my rational was always that I question the legality of bitcoins. BTC earned through mining is going to be hard to follow up on, but people who have bought have probably left some kind of audit trail. 
Anyway, I feel pretty stupid now from a purely financial point of view, from a legal point of view it wasn't worth the risk for me - unless someone can convince me that BTC are perfectly legal.

It is a bit like the media companies fighting against digital copies of their media, first the ridiculed pirates, then they fought them, now they are finding that they unavoidably have to move with the times. I think cryptocurrencies will follow a similar path. I think Bitcoin is lacking in it's design somewhat, but something better will come along to replace it.  The main issue is to who gets to "own" these currencies from the start, so I think we might see instead a staged virtualisation of fiat currencies, with no beneficiary apart from the initial fund owner. I don't think we will see a massive gold rush like we have seen with bitcoin, as I don't think mining will work in the same way.

Ok thanks for the info, i'm in Sweden and there is no guideline yet.

The logic is sound, but if you have lost 50% sometimes it is better to cut your losses and cash out lest you lose the whole amount.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:26:15
I appreciate your sentiment, but I meant that to mine bitcoins requires a proof of effort that solves meaningful equations for the good of mankind, maybe I should fork Bitcoin and make a proteinfolding coin

As soon as it stops being true i guess people will stop linking
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:58:19
I agree, but i really think it is at the top and will correct soon.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:26:48
Impressive.. I saw that on the blockchain and wondered who that could be..
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:08:57
I am kicking myself really i knew about bitcoin about a month after it started, but i didnt dare buying coins back then as it was in a grey area legally.. So i still have no coins to this day

blockchain is one of the best sites I have ever used, it's incredibly fast and stable. If I knew who was behind the site I would offer them a job.

Think I will wait a bit seems the curve is very much  in the fear phase
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:49:20
Doesn't really have much to do with Bitcoin though really.. if you trust anyone with anything of value they can run off on you. simple. I mean criminals trusting criminals with money - oh dear.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:05:53
This is a fantastic discussion thread - probably some of the best thinking on this subject.. You are right there are no indications, but what happens when BTC / VC starts to become a threat to the dollar. Then you have a problem, and I can see governments preventing this massive shift in power in one way, and that is regulation, which in turn will remove value from BTC and other VC. As systems in their own right they are - as you point out , impossible to stop by technical means -  but not judicial means.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:30:23
Well it is a good point, I don't often use cash much either, but BTC back then seemed inextricably and in the main part linked with deep web etc, and I didn't want to be involved with that. Hammers are usually used for banging in nails not skulls.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:35:57
if it makes you feel any better, I am much the same demographic as you (though a bit older), I was aware of bitcoin in 2009, infact, I also had a strong feeling it was going to appreciate in value once it was really rolling, I didn't ever and still have no bitcoins to my name.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:19:09
Don't you see bitcoin as their next target? they just have to find some people using it for nefarious purposes and they can shut the whole thing down (all exchanges and basically outlaw transactions)
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:47:04
Hmm didn't know about that, but yes that's the idea, although an improvement could be to make it different types of proof of work (not just primes, but folding proteins, or other heavy challenges) for the same coin.
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:51:25
similar story here, if it makes you feel any better. I have a knack of identifying new exciting technologies and then never cashing in on them at all (the university I went to was the third university in the world to be connected to the internet), I knew it was going to be huge and people would eventually sell sites for silly money to greedy investors.
Oh well.. maybe next time we will listen to our gut feelings.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:59:42
why not use all this computing power to do something more useful as a proof of effort?
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:07:11
I think the elephant in the room is the legality of btc, and when and how governments will want to intervene. With BTC used as a way to rapidly move around value with no inspection, as a way of tax avoidance and as a convenient method for more shady deals - sooner or later governments will try to regulate, as soon as this happens I think BTC will correct.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:48:32
well right now its the lower echelons that are declaring it legal not the real policy makers, i think if crypo currency starts to challenge, say the dollar as a means of exchange, then we are going to see some major pushback, don't you think?
