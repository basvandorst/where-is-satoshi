I think the last one is the biggest contributer. If you've made a large return its a smart decision to capitalize on at least some of the gains to avoid risk. I bet a lot of that money comes back in after the decision no matter what.

I guess I should be more aware of that. Itll be interesting to see how the etfs will deal with that.

Ive been following since January. Knew about bitcoin a few years ago, but it seemed to risky to dable in. When I started to really look into it in January, I realized it was safer and that the volatility was at least now more understandable
I'm a undergrad finance major, so I'm not investing big, I'm just really fascinated about bitcoin's market and story.

I guess that plays into the problem of the ability for billionaires to control and manipulate the market the market. Hopefully that kind of stuff goes away and more people invest.

No their buys trigger the spike. When it spikes, they sell and make very easy very quick profits.
Buys at about 1200 trigger the auto buys, which bring the price to 1300. Then the person who bought at 1200 who caused all of this sells hist bitcoin and makes 8.3% profit in less then an hour.

What I mean was that it at least seems more secure. Dont hear anything about bitcoin's getting stolen anymore
