Clearly false as this would make all investments ponzi schemes. 
When you buy a bitcoin if you wanted you can then immediately sell for the price which you bought it, because you are purchasing an asset, like gold.
You can't do this in a ponzi because the profit is immediately sent up the pyramid at point of sale. It's why you have to lock a loan in for 200 days in bitconnect.
The topology of bitcoin, like any asset, is flat. Gains are proportional to holdings as are losses. The topology of a ponzi is pyramid like. The top levels profit disproportionately from income from the bottom as each additional layer makes a % based on what level in the ponzi they are in.

This is a false premise. Transacting is a use case but holding is also a use case. Holding bitcoin is holding wealth outside of legacy asset classes in a non correlated asset, which in of itself is highly valuable.

Part of the problem is that BitPay's payment gateway is poorly implemented. They give a 15 min window for a confirmation, when many times a block is not even mined in 15 mins. This wasn't always the case, they used to accept 0 confirm transactions which I think they should revert back to. But even if not the transaction should remain valid for way longer than 15 min.

Possibly. Although double spend fraud only really factors into digital goods as for physical goods you can wait for confs before shipping. 
I think the transaction should be bounded by BTC:USD ratio instead of time, ie if the price doesn't move much the transaction is still valid even if it takes 12 hrs for the first confirmation.

I don't think now is the time to act unless your transfers are very time sensitive.

Or they are people that have invested responsibly and have only invested what they can afford to lose so they are not panicking selling during flash crashes.

@_date: 2017-12-23 15:23:24
Capitalizing on an opportunity does not equal taking huge risks. Its the opposite. The earlier you are the less you need to risk for equivalent returns. Early adopter returns came from the fact that they held long term and didn't panic sell, which is the opposite of gambling.

It's not though. That is the line noobs to the space are fed so they will throw VC money at wordpress icos. The reality is that they are inseparable, because the utility (and hence value) of a blockchain is entirely based in immutability. It is only immutable because of distributed mining. And it is only mined for its value. They are inseparable.

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:09:23
At least they have custom fee option. Wallets like Jaxx don't even have that so you are forced into paying 10x what you want to for a non time sensitive transaction, which in turn pushes up the fees for everyone whose transaction is time sensitive.

It's relative. Relative to world population nobody uses bitcoin. Relative to the whole of crypto, less and less people are using bitcoin. Future user number of alts is uncapped, where as for BTC it is effectively capped at what we are at now. So until blocksize increases, bitcoin user number can only fall or stay the same. Alt user number can fall, stay the same or grow.


It shows the opposite. Speculators don't care about transaction fees as they do not make frequent on-chain transactions. Traders trade between currency pairs on exchanges where it never touches the blockchain unless depositing/withdrawing.
People using BTC as currency and companies accepting BTC are getting hit the hardest by fees.

This is pure conjecture. Unless they are government, what incentive do they have to disrupt bitcoin?

This stance created a predictable outcome. Many left. Which is fine, except if you are taking part in a system that requires consensus in order to upgrade. You no longer have the ear of those who disagree with you, so there is no narrative, and so no consensus can be reached.

The problem isn't buying bitcoin, it's selling fiat. The KYC regulations are all on the fiat side of the transaction. That's why a LocalBitcoin p2p trade is quicker. Your bitcoin wallet doesn't ask you for a photo ID to send BTC, your bank will to send fiat.

No, support is symbolic but it doesn't represent the reality of what is actually going to happen. What will happen is determined by economic incentive. This is why bigger blocks are inevitable. It's getting the core devs to understand that *that* is what decides, not their ideas of consensus, is the problem. You are in denial if you think the ideology of the devs has any real say in the economic future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:38:11
That's part of the problem, the pros of keeping the blocksize small are technical in nature but the cons are social, economical and game theoretical in nature. The devs understand the technical aspects but don't understand that given a choice between two identical services/products people don't opt for the more expensive option. Bitcoin doesn't work as the "expensive settlement layer" because it is completely opt-in and has limitless replicability.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:50:34
Except bitcoin isn't an internet domain or repository, it is just a protocol of consensus of the majority. I'm guessing you have been around bitcoin long enough to know this?
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:47:17
Your conflating peoples ideological alignment with their current actions. The current hash rate means nothing because the current economics are that of a system in which blocks aren't full. People don't have any reason to move to XT yet. XT and core are the same until 75% run core and untill 2016. You might be in for a surprise when blocks start getting full and fees start rising though. Miners just follow the money. That's why bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:08:55
Again you are ignoring the reality of human nature. People need an impetus to change. XT support is senseless until it can actively effect. It can not actively effect until 2016. And the impetus is rising fees, so measuring current hash rate as representative of "support" is logically flawed.

A new way of governing bitcoin is inevitable should bitcoin succeed. Politicians, banks, fin tech and big business, aren't just going to watch the market cap of bitcoin rise, the tech proliferate and not inject themselves into it at the source. The devs are naive if they think it is going to end up as 5 Comp Sci guys in a room bartering 'consensus'. Multiple implementations, multiple competing 'leaders', opposing vested interests are inevitable.
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:30:09


This is basic economics. It will cost less to get your transaction in a bigger block than a smaller block. So what do users use, the crypto that costs $1 per transaction, or the crypto that costs $0.03? And seeing as value is derived from userbase, you can work out where the value goes, and then you can workout where the miners go.
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:47:55
There's no debate. People pay less over paying more.
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:14:14
Without payments there is no fungibility. Without the ability to spend bitcoin, the bitcoin economy freezes and just becomes a zero sum game where users just hope others will hold for the sake of holding, basically ideological. As all the speculation is built on potential future growth, that falls away. Also it means there is nothing that discerns bitcoin from any other crypto. Payments is a large part of bitcoins network effect. Once it is no longer the de-facto crypto, its use as a store of wealth completely collapses.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:24:24


People only hold bitcoin because of its future purchasing power, like all money. Bitcoin only sustains itself as a commodity because of its utility. Without payments it doesn't work, because it doesn't hold value.

Movement to XT will be low until economic incentives force it. As soon as blocks fill and fees rise people there is economic impetus and there will be movement for larger blocks (XT, BIP100, whatever is available).

The hashing power is only there because it follows the profit. You cant have a free settlement layer, it doesn't work for economic reasons. You also can't have a high value value settlement layer with cryptocurency because it is opt in and free to replicate. It's diametrically opposed to the utility of the cryptocurrency, where the only thing holding up its value is its userbase, and it requires value to have utility. It means it just isn't possible to have a "free-to-opt-in-free-to-opt-out" settlement layer using cryptocurrency. It has to be cheap enough to be accessible or its use-cases gets usurped by the identical alt that doesn't have the prohibitive costs. The problem is getting the devs to understand this.
