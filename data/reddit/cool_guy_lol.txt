How is bitcoin suppose to live up to the financial bubble hype of replacing fiat currencies for transactions if it the transaction volume is rapidly declining and credit card based fiat currency transactions is skyrocketing?
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:37:50
"I have this awesome currency called bitcoin that is going to replace the US dollar. You can't buy anything with it because no one accepts it for payment. But you can sell it for US dollars and then buy the goods and services that what you actually want!"
Yes of course I do. If few people are transacting in a currency then it is not a useful medium of exchange. Might as well just use a barter system.
Additionally for any asset that is not changing hands frequently could be an illiquid asset and it may be extremely difficult to find a buyer or seller without having huge swings in the price of the underlying asset class. This is one of the main reasons why investors analyze the trading volume in a stock market.
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:20:10
Bitcoin transactional use is falling, as is interest for the currency. Just look at a chart on google trends of bitcoin. Only trading is speculators hoping to sell it to a greater fool and make a profit. This is the late stages of the bubble collapsing.

You are correct that fiat money is for fools and it will lose value over time. What you fail to realize is that crypto currency has a lot more in common with fiat currency than speculators realize. They are both made up out of thin air and have no intrinsic value.
Lots of geniuses do research, get caught up in a speculative bubble, and end up broke. It happened to Isaac Newton and it will happen to you as well.

You're missing the reality. Look at a google trends chart and search for bitcoin. The general public has lost all interest in bitcoin. The searches for bitcoin are around 1% of what they were 8 months ago. All the hype is gone and the speculators are leaving. That is what has changed.

Because you can't do anything with bitcoin except try to sell it to a greater fool who also thinks he can sell his bitcoin to another fool for a profit.
Almost no one uses bitcoin for transnational purposes and nothing is priced in bitcoin, thus you need a central exchange to convert your bitcoin into a usable medium of exchange like US dollars. 
The exchanges are ripe for government regulation, surveillance, and taxation.

@_date: 2018-10-12 20:41:42
Investments in stocks are actually income producing assets. Businesses that produce products and services, create value for society, and generate income streams.
 
Bitcoin is not an investment, it is speculation. There is no cash flow to invest in. The only thing you can do with it is hope that some greater fool will buy it at a higher price in the future. That person is buying it with the expectation that they too will be able to sell it to a greater fool in the future, which won't work for obvious reasons: eventually you run out of fools.
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:42:02


There is acceptance today, but that acceptance is decaying (price went from 20k to 6k), and there may not be acceptance tomorrow. When all the dust settles I expect many to be stuck with 90%+ losses.

People losing their retirement  buying bitcoin at 20k is a lot different than some nerds losing $100 of play money when bitcoin went from $100 to $20. Those speculators were roasted and will make it near impossible for this bubble to reinflate. It has already peaked.

@_date: 2018-06-14 01:24:31
Interest in bitcoin is waning. Just search for bitcoin on google trends, it is basically dead. That means people aren't searching about bitcoin and few new "investors" are coming into the market.
There was interest when people thought they were going to be bitcoin millionaires but now that people have suffered heavy losses and bitcoin is sending people to the poorhouse no one is interested. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:40:18
Yes which is why it is a bubble. People are only interested in bitcoin as a speculative asset that they can try to sell to some other fool at a higher price who thinks he can sell it to an even greater fool. 
Expectations can change quickly and that nonsense doesn't work now that the bubble is deflating.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:39:56
People can't sell their bitcoin without collapsing the market as there are few buyers on the other end of the transaction. A lot of people that think they "multiplied their money" will never be able to realize their fictitious gains. Without more suckers coming in to buy there is no one to sell to.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:11:50
The misconception is because bitcoin is being compared to of tangible goods with intrinsic value.
For instance, if the price of mining gold falls below the costs of mining, then eventually the price of gold will have to rise until it is economical.
The difference here is that gold is a valuable commodity to society that is used for electronics, jewelry, and medicine. When bitcoin is "mined" there is nothing of value created -- it only facilities transactions and if people don't want to transact in bitcoin then the mining adds zero value.
One of the reasons that the term "mining" is used in bitcoin is to try to create the illusion that there is value and that something is being mined when really it is all imaginary.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:44:11
Google trends disagrees with you. Interest in bitcoin is gone.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:15:52
Several reasons.
In my view bitcoin is a massive bubble that is going to burst. So to the extent that people avoid it by using sound logic rather than hype they can avoid losses from people such as yourself trying to lure in new buyers to so that you can sell your coins at a profit.
I have also profited personally by shorting bitcoin related stocks.
I study economics and find the bitcoin bubble interesting and entertaining. I think it's going to hilarious when genius investors trying to decide which color lambo they should buy end up broke. We are already starting to see that with the 70&amp; decline. Even when people like myself spell the whole thing out for them they can't understand what is going on
There are great lessons to be learned here from behavioral finance perspective. I think books of the future will look back on the bitcoin bubble as examples of popular delusion akin to the tulip bulbs and beanie baby craze.

@_date: 2018-06-29 05:44:28

Not at all. Legitimate investments like bonds and stocks have actual profits behind them that benefit all investors. You don't have to make money by selling to someone else. In fact even if the market values a security at $0 it doesn't matter because you can still collect a bond or dividend payment.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:39:54
It is actually a negative sum game. It is a net loss for all "investors" after transaction fees to run the exchanges and taxes paid to government. As a collectively community everyone ends up poorer and anyone who makes a profit is at the expense of someone else making a loss.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:03:09
Bitcoin is a zero sum game and a massive ponzi scheme. A genius bitcoin "investor" can only make money if someone else is recruited to lose money. Those that got in early make a huge profit at the expense of those that got in late. The people who came in late are now getting stuck with losses.
Bitcoin is also losing popularity. Look at a google trends chart of bitcoin. No one is interested in bitcoin and thus no one is coming in to form the base of the pyramid and the whole thing is unraveling.
The longer people HODL the larger their losses will be.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:15:12
If HODLers of bitcoin decide to start spending their bitcoin that is a huge negative for the price. 
The only way the bubble was able to inflate so much is because no one wanted to sell any bitcoin because they had delusions of being a multimillionaire with a mansion and yacht.
Once people start selling bitcoin to spend it the price collapses.

@_date: 2018-03-09 16:42:58
That is pure speculation that bitcoin will become some major currency. Nothing is showing that to be the case. 
Almost no one buys goods or services using bitcoin, and when they do everything is priced in a fiat currency. You buy it something with bitcoin and then the seller immediately converts it to US Dollars because they don't want to deal with the risk of holding an extremely volatile asset than can fall 50% in an hour.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:26:51
The Mt. Gox sellers proves there is no liquidity in the system. Simply selling thousands of bitcoin on the market causes the price to collapse. It proves there are no real buyers on the other end of the transaction. The HODLers can't take their "profits" out because doing so would collapse the price.

@_date: 2018-03-15 22:48:35
Perhaps you should write a riches to rags story. I would bet there are more people with losses than profits on bitcoin. When CNBC was promoting it daily there were millions of gamblers coming in on the collapse from 20k to 6k.
Also to make a profit off bitcoin you need to profile someone who actually cashed out. If you ride bitcoin up to 20k it isn't going to matter if you ride it all the way back down to 200.
I suspect there will be individuals commiting suicide after the bubble bursts.

The HODLers are going to become FODLers.

Bitcoin is a massive bubble that is collapsing as we speak. The only question is how fast the air comes out of the bubble and how much whining there will it doesn't end well.

How do you know what low is? There is no intrinsic value or cash flow that can be used to value it. Bitcoin could be worthless and buying at $100 could be overpriced.

No one can handle that would exist in offering a loan in bitcoin. It can drop 20% in minutes. It is possible that it will be completely worthless in a few years. That is too risky for a lender.

Cryptocurrency has a lot more in common with fiat currency than people realize. They are both made up out of this air, backed by nothing, and there have been thousands of cryptocurrencies created (but all the others are phony, bitcoin is special, and is going to make you rich, right? ha ha).
Anyone HODLing bitcoin thinking it is a store of value is going to be disappointed. Warren Buffett has it right when he says that bitcoin won't end well for "investors".

You didn't "lose millions". You lost un-obfuscated access to a bunch of binary 0's and 1's made up out of thin air. Perhaps those will sell to a fool for thousands of dollars today but once the bubble completely bursts they will be worthless.

Most people expect bitcoin to go right back up to the moon, which tells me we have a lot further to fall.
I will believe there is a bitcoin bottom when most everyone has capitulated, has no hope, and we read articles about people being financially ruined by the bubble.

Have fun going down with the sinking ship.

Bitcoin will fall to $200 and you will see suicidal posts on this subreddit.

Millions of people bought into this bubble when it was being promoted by CNBC and will be stuck with massive losses as the air comes out.
Bitcoin won't even well for "investors"

Your security is so good that no one can access it! Good job.

All of that trading volume is simply using Bitcoin is a speculative vehicle. Gamblers inside a casino placing bets that it will go up. Not a good sign of the future.
