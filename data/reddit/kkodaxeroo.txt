Could governments use this as an argument for banning bitcoin?  **Yes.**

The same people buying mining hardware from Jihan and strengthening his hand, are the same ones complaining about Jihan.
I see all these miners complaining about Bitmain, and yet not seeming to realise that they are the ones funding their business.
What do you think Bitmain does with the profit from selling miners? They manufacture more miners for themselves. And they get them at cost.
**You cannot beat Bitmain by buying products from them.** They will always win at that game. You buy one S9 from them, they make 2 more for themselves with your money.
It's like complaining that McDonalds is evil whilst stuffing your face with a Big Mac.
The only way to compete with Bitmain, is to design a better ASIC. Americans own the CPU industry. Why is there no American competition for an SHA-256 ASIC?
Bitcoin is designed for miners to have the vote. The only way to even the vote is to have competition. And there isn't any.
Maybe instead of uselessly whinging that somebody else won the race (it's like Intel complaining about ARM - pointless), somebody needs to start training for the next heat?

OK, so let's pretend I believe in the Bitcoin, and I have collected $6000 USD in my grubbly little hands, and I want to purchase one (1) Bitcoin.
(a) How do I find a Bitcoin exchange that will reliably and honestly, sell me a Bitcoin without getting itself shut down by the US Federal Government within weeks?
(b) How can I verify that whatever it is I have purchased, is a **real authentic Bitcoin**?
(c) Will there, reliably, be a Bitcoin exchange in the future that has not been shut down by the US Federal Government, where I will be able to sell my Bitcoin one year from now?
==== ==== ==== 
These are standard Newbie questions.   I presume they have an answer.   What is the answer?  
Can regular Joe-on-the-street individuals, with no expert knowledge of cryptography or cryptocurrencies, buy Bitcoins without getting ripped off?

You get YOUR facts straight!  WIRED magazine says it was 850,000 Bitcoins.

I can't tell if this is funny or not.
