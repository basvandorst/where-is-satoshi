Too bad America in no way represents a democracy anymore.

The fact this guy thinks his card is "straight bitcoin from Coinbase" is enough to prove they are making it up, &amp; is just riding a karma train.

Tumblers/mixers help

Every aspect of that statement shows how uninformed you are. Not just about Sanders either.

I'm in my 30's and never served. Still have insurance and banking through USAA.

And Infowars at that. I doubt she realizes what a sad pathetic joke it is.

Venezuelans trying to exchange their fiat for something with actual value.

Whut?

Strange, I seem to be hearing a lot more whining about it all from Clinton and the liberal media.  
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:07:33
Fake? No.
Propaganda rag pieces pushing an agenda. Absolutely correct.
That's fake enough for me.

u/Coincle will show the world he has no moral fiber and has no honesty or integrity. Just like Hillary and the DNC.

Um...Yes it does if you have a cc or other fund sources linked. If you use a checking account, it takes, wait for it...,about a week.
Why don't you actually read up on how it works before complaining and making ignorant statements?
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:33:15
Eh....except you obviously don't. I'm going to buy some coins **instantly**  today because I have the right funds sources.

Interesting, that's the first I've seen that one. The one I watched had people printing out hard bitcoin certificates, using a bitcoin atm, and other scenes. This version has been completely eradicated from the internets as far as I can tell. I have not been able to find it online again.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:38:14
Did you not watch the video at all? There's more than "just the PayPal digitally crossed and Bitcoin written over." Did you not see scenes with the Bitcoin logo? Where people were exchanging physical bitcoin? Where people were using Bitcoin atms?
Usually people would watch the video before forming opinions about it.
Edit: Apparently there was two versions? I've only seen one with scenes changed, not just text.

I thought you were not going to reply to anymore post - at least that what you had said this morning when I read through this thread.
Hell, if I owned a business of any sort, I'd ban you too. Simply because you're an intolerable asshole. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:16:30
Yes! That's the one I originally saw. It was more than just changing the text. Thanks.

It’s complete r/SadCringe material these days.

The article made no reference that despite the raised concern after Paris, and the increased fear mongering about encryption after it, it was later learned the attacks were coordinated via plain SMS messages. Makes you question Forbes motive.

Some people are still holding on to those damn things. Waiting for the moment they can finally cash in on those bean investments with much disappointment. Just saying. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 15:48:19
haha, RT America. hahahaha
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:47:14


Stopped reading or caring right then. At the start. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:27:06
Why the fuck would you even make the suggestion that people should just donate anything to you for doing nothing? This is ridiculous &amp; does nothing to promote Bitcoin in a good light. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:54:56
It's RT. Do you even need to think about it?
Russian propaganda. What a joke. Not to mention what a low production quality that show is. I've seem better AV quality from high school teams.
