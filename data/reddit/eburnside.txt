It'll never happen, but it'd be interesting to see a copy of the business plan they submitted to secure the $21M and later $55M funding rounds.
It seems apparent whatever they did (actual actions) between the first round and the second round was sufficient progress toward their business plan to warrant an additional $55M.

They could have founded a non-profit corporation and accomplished the same personal protections.

There are a lot of zero-conf services out there already, and zero-conf is no different than a credit card.  A credit card is just a promise to pay and not charge back, it doesn't finally settle for the merchant until 90 days later when a charge back is no longer allowed.  I'll take 10 minutes over that any day.
I think we will need a combination of 100 MB blocks AND LN (or something like it.) to reach the world.
And there are ways to scale way beyond VISA, LN is not perfect, but it's a good example of that, by splitting transaction processing across a global pool of computing resources.  We'll have so many more nodes by the time we've reached global adoption that you could shard Bitcoin transactions out to where each node only holds 1 in 100 transactions and still have each transaction stored on more nodes than we do today.

Except that we will have to anyway.  Even the LN devs have said 100+ MB blocks are going to be necessary.  They're just keeping Bitcoin throttled to encourage LN development, which is probably smart getting it developed now rather than later when the market cap (and thus risk) is much higher.

Talk about misinformation.  100 MB will only cover 2 on-chain transactions a year for the entire world.  That's a fair bit short of reality, meaning we'll need that 100 MB long before the entire world is actually using it.  I watched them present LN.  Nice try tho.

Satoshi also envisioned scaling completely differently:


I think Satoshi's approach is where we should have been going the last year or so while LN was being developed because even the LN devs have said much larger (120+ MB!) blocks will be necessary for Bitcoin+LN to work for everyone globally.

If you're going to rent a server for anything sensitive do it in a jurisdiction you have legal standing and can hold the host responsible if there are any inside jobs.

Agree that a merchant or shopper should know what they're doing whether they're using CC or Bitcoin.  For most the likes of Circle, Bitpay, or Coinbase are happy to help.
I didn't link the article because of inconvenience or even the effect of a data breach on a credit card user.  I linked it to point out how crazy the overhead can be for a merchant to accept credit cards.  In this case, $106,000,000 plus 2%-3% of all of their revenue generated via CC transactions.
Some math:  says they have around $72B annual revenue.  If half their revenue comes in via CC and they pay a 2% merchant fee, that's $720,000,000 a year they're paying in transaction fees and it's not new info, but you know that overhead just gets passed on to the customer in the form of higher prices.

If you really don't like paying tax, buy a small farm, ranch, or cabin in the woods.  Live off the land.  About the only tax you'd have to pay is property tax, which you could fairly easily cover by selling just your leftover veggies/animals/trees/whatever.
The lower and middle class' (of which I am a part) standard of living now includes cell phones and nice cars and designer clothes and fast food.  A lot of that is possible because of the economics large international companies bring to the table.
Also, as a partial small business owner who created the business as a corporation, I should point out that corporations in the USA pay a far higher tax than most of the rest of the world.  For me to take money out of the company the company first has to pay 39%, THEN I have to pay tax on what the company passes to me as dividends at 15%-23.8%.  The rates are insane and from where I sit, it's an obvious double taxation.
My take is they need to make the corporate income tax rate very low, like 0% - 5%, then remove the special rates on personal income from qualified dividends and make investors pay the regular tiered income rates.  That'd do two things, the companies wouldn't have an incentive to hoard cash anymore, and taxpayers that invested in these companies would pay their arguably fair share of income tax when it gets passed to them as dividends.

This is not true.
Higher prices do not qualify as minimal impact.
Why would they have to store any Bitcoin at all?  Use BitPay or Coinbase for merchant services.

Federal Court classifications are what you use when there is ambiguity in the policy.  No one itemizes every little thing in their home, yet it is covered under a generic property section in most policies.  If it goes to court, the court is going to use their definition where none other is specified.
The chances now of a personal IT compromise versus fire is irrelevant.  I was clear that any insurance company would have set policies you would have to follow, like requiring you to use Bread Wallet on iOS or something.
And no, I'm not making assumptions.  I have a general business policy that covers my company's bitcoins and everything else under the roof against earthquake, fire, flood, and yes, hacking.  It costs less than 1% of annual revenue, and less than 0.2% of the value of the business.  To get it though we had to apply and demonstrate that we could follow certain policy guidelines.

Fires are irreversible.  Fire insurance is not enormous.  The insurer sets a standard for which they're willing to insure a building and prices the insurance accordingly.
Insurers could easily set a policy and require you to stick by that policy for reasonable coverage.  Policy might be that you have to use a Trezor, or maybe a particular phone or app or operating system that they know is secure.
With Bitcoins being property according to the IRS, some homeowners and renters insurance might already cover losses due to theft.

This.  Me too.
Initiated a buy, they took the funds from my account next day.  I was excited that week, watching the price go up at least $30.

No, I don't think it's them.  I think they've handled it poorly, but it feels more like I've made it onto a blacklist somewhere and they had no choice but to close it.
I also fully support a business's right to choose with whom they do business.
Still, the withdrawal was for nearly the entire account balance, and they sent me an account closure notice saying that they need bank info to process a final withdrawal?  Where's the other 99% of my money that I asked for 17 days ago?
Doesn't add up.
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:38:57
I think I made the point that the services I receive I already pay for.  Per-transaction fees, settlement fees, merchant account fees, and gateway fees all cover the cost of running the network.
The 3%-5% is on top of all that and covers the cardholder loss scenarios like leaving their wallet on the train or plugging their card info into sketch dating  websites.  The chip+pin stuff will help this significantly.  Bet you almost anything though that the 3%-5% doesn't drop accordingly.
I agree that there's a layer missing in the Bitcoin setup right now.  Because of the way the chargeback system works merchants are essentially at the whim of the cardholder to pay and then not file a chargeback.  The same effect could be achieved via some form of automated escrow.

Their "account closure" process needs some work.  There should be a way to access support tickets and account transaction history in perpetuity.

Stumbled into that a few months ago!  I tried to use it but eventually gave up.  I wanted to do a withdrawal and first it wanted me to create an account, so I did.  Then it wanted me to send bitcoin to the account, which I did not do... it would have taken too long to confirm and it wouldn't give me an exact amount to send to be able to withdraw a fixed amount of USD.  
I think these things should just ask you how much you want to withdraw, in multiples of $20, then give you a fixed amount to send to a deposit address.  Instead you're left guessing how much bitcoin it will take to get your $20, and you'll almost always have to send extra to account for exchange rate fluctuation and unforseen fees.  This is a no-go for me because then I'm leaving bitcoin in an account with the ATM operator and I have no idea how to get to it outside of the ATM itself, which since I don't live in Portland, I may never see again.
Would really love to see these things take off, but it felt like the process itself hadn't been thoroughly thought out.

Hindsight of course is 20/20.  I was significantly more skeptical than you seem to be that beta software and bits on my hard drive would pass as a legally recognized store of value.  I fully expected vulnerabilities and bugs to show up that would require periodic resets of the network, among other major issues.  The stated motivation for starting the exchanges was legit, which is why Litecoin was initially used rather than Bitcoin.  Sometimes I wish I hadn't made the Bitcoin version. I thought I could help out the community after the GLBSE shutdown but it was nothing but trouble.  :)
The offshore incorporation was to simplify taxes and provide an easy transfer for the assets of the exchange should I wish to sell it later, not to avoid any particular regulatory issues.  I never hid my identity behind the company or anything of the sort.

There is no excuse for not responding to queries about the status of the May 28 withdrawal.  Even a "we're looking into it" would seem to be common courtesy and far less likely to arouse suspicion.

I've used my US credit cards in Canada a bit.  Some offer "free" conversions and take their percentage in the exchange rate.  Others take their percentage via a "foreign transaction fee". Last time I looked at it both types were taking around 5%.
None of my cards have given me as good a rate as US Forex on a straight US bank to Canadian bank transaction.  As I write this I see on usforex.com a rate of 1.3558 to transact $5000 USD, whereas google gives me a rate of 1.38 when I search "1 usd to cad".

Good to know.  I tested their support a bit before my first deposit and subsequent withdrawal.  I'd had a bunch of questions about whether international wires were supported if my bank didn't have a SWIFT number.

Prefer not to discuss the values involved, but I will say you have to be very careful with this.  It's actually a crime (called structuring) to intentionally make transactions under $10k for the purposes of avoiding the reporting rules.  There are lots of stories out on the internets about completely innocent people getting their bank accounts seized because for whatever reason they had a pattern of sub-$10k transactions over time.
In general I try to make transactions over $10k when possible.

As an international internet merchant (hosting company) myself this is just my opinion from a merchant perspective.  I don't think the services provided to card holders should be paid by the merchants.  Most major purchases already come with a warranty against defects, and your homeowners or renters insurance should cover accidents or thefts.  I don't have the option of accepting cash or checks.  I am stuck giving up 3%-5% of my revenue right off the top every single month and it's all for services the cardholder receives, not services I receive.  (I pay separate flat per-transaction fees, settlement fees, merchant account fees, and gateway fees.)
Someone charging something to your card from another state shouldn't happen with Bitcoin.  You don't have to give up sensitive data just to pay someone.  Yeah, it sucks when you screw up and lose your private key, but how is that a cost the merchant should bear?  Bitcoin properly aligns security incentives with financial incentives.

As a tax-paying US Citizen who has filed an extension while trying to figure WTF to do about the ~10,000 small volume trades between BTC&lt;-&gt;LTC I did during the year... I can't help but wonder how this is going to affect the bottom line on capital gains.
If the pricing of BTC&lt;-&gt;USD and thus likely LTC&lt;-&gt;USD was being manipulated, and I have to pay taxes on all BTC&lt;-&gt;LTC transactions as if they were BTC&lt;-&gt;USD&lt;-&gt;LTC... then I have a pretty big issue on my hands.

I can talk about the tech now that we're shutdown and all the funds disbursed.  For btct.co (BTC-TC) we had a hot wallet with a once a minute cron that would automatically transfer anything over about 50 BTC to our cold wallet.  Then small withdrawals were instant and large withdrawals went into a manually processed queue.
The cold wallet was held on an old laptop running an encrypted linux install.  It was booted up and connected to the internet behind a trusted firewall a couple times a day to process the manual withdrawals.  (Which also were frequently scrutinized somewhat.). Backups of this system were made to encrypted USB drives periodically.
A third wallet, I dubbed the cryo-wallet was made using an encrypted offline linux install on a small SSD.  (Install from DVD, burn bitcoind source to dvd, copy in, compile, create wallet.). Anything in the cold wallet over certain threshold was sent to the cryo-wallet.  Backups of it were kept on encrypted USB storage, and the SSD itself wasn't left in the PC.
We didn't have to make any withdrawals from the cryowallet until we shutdown, which was nice.  It would have been a PITA.
Were I to start from scratch there are definitely things I would improve on, starting with replacing the cron with a script tied directly into bitcoind.  I also was about 90% of the way through a transition away from using bitcoind for account balances to using an SQL db to track balances so that I could have more separation of the app and bitcoind, potentially even getting to where the app never made any calls direct to bitcoind.
Lots of other improvements could be made I'm sure.
Some may suggest paper wallets for the offline part, but seems like encrypted USB is about the same until an EMP hits?  :)

@_date: 2016-03-01 05:38:06
That's pretty cool!
I suspect if Bitcoin were doing 8 GB blocks then the value of the network would also be high enough to find higher bandwidth broadcast solutions.
Eg; If 1 MB blocks get us 3 TPS today, then 8 GB blocks should get us 8,000x = 24,000 TPS.  (in 2010 Visa was doing around 2,000 TPS average)
That kind of TPS could result in a Bitcoin market cap large enough to make it worth bidding on some radio spectrum with the FCC and deploying some relay towers.  Or more fun, jgarzik's satellite relay project.
Add: That satellite thought got me wondering what the thruput might be on a satellite system... some fuzzy math... I found an article from 2008 saying Dish TV was expanding to 22 HD channels.  I know that HD streaming requires 3 Mbps - 4 Mbps, so we can extrapolate a minimum of 22 x 3 Mbps = 66 Mbps is piping down at a receiving dish at any given time.  Doing the math, over 10 minutes that supports a roughly 5 GB block.  
Doh, just found this:   DirecTV says they have ~200 HD channels, so there you go.  8 GB blocks via satellite, no problem.

A great high-level write up.  I've suggested before that something like BGP, the current internet routing protocol, could be used for the routing.  There are hurdles though because BGP can logically group addresses by IP subnets and I'm not sure if there is a way to logically group Bitcoin addresses or not.  Without logical grouping the routing table quickly grows to an unmanageable size.
The other thing I haven't seen addressed is fee discovery.  Once you have all the possible routes you're going to want to know what the fees are going to be for each route so you can choose the cheapest path.  I've seen talks where they discuss dynamic fees to encourage flows that fit certain directional parameters so it gets very complex quickly.
Looking forward to seeing what they come up with!

If the fee is set reasonably to compensate miners no attacker is going to burn that kind of money.

Why can't we change which block gets orphaned in a competing propagation scenario to favor the larger block?  Eg, if 2 competing blocks come in within say 5s of each other, favor the larger one.

It doesn't have to be a lot of money per block.  It adds up quickly across 144 blocks/day.  The thought that anyone would effectively hand the (core supporting) miners extra cash for free seems highly unlikely.  Far more likely is that the steady growth of the network, as has been quite publicly obvious and predicted for more than a year, has finally caught up to the network's current artificially imposed limitations.
I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this but the situation today was completely avoidable, either by accelerating LN dev, or by trivially expanding capacity.

I agree that Bitcoin needs to first and foremost be a fully functional money before it can take over other functions.  The St. Louis Fed says: "The characteristics of money are durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability."
Bitcoin's durability is improving as wallet apps and hardware wallets improve.  Bitcoin portability is fantastic and getting better all the time.  Divisibility and Limited Supply are also solid.
Acceptability though we have a long way to go.  This is where I think all the scaling work comes in, and progress is being made.
Uniformity (fungibility) is currently a disaster.  It should not be possible for everyone to see private party transaction details.  This is not an argument for anonymous transactions, which is a different concept all together.  I mean that, like cash, when I buy a coffee the whole world doesn't need to know what my favorite shop is and how much I spend on my espresso.

The protocol needs improvement.  I can't remember the source but someone told me a while back that transactions get relayed twice.  Once individually, then again with the block propagation.

Thank you, I appreciate that.  The fine was manageable, mostly because of my day job.  All income from the site itself was calculated and taken as a part of the fine, called disgorgement.  The hardest part was I was not allowed to consider legal fees as an expense.  So the fine was the income before legal fees, not after, which was really painful.

With a colo your only exposures to the ISP should be outage scenarios (they fail to provide power, or cut your network feed) and potential sniffing of the wire.  Most everything else can be mitigated.  (using tools like encrypted storage, intrusion alarms that trigger shutdowns, etc.)


Yeah, if you're only exposing a fraction of your coins this may be true, but if you're hacked once, it's highly likely you'll be hacked again.  The costs mount.  And ignoring reputational cost in a financial services role is a pretty big thing to ignore.


I think it makes a lot of sense to delegate a lot of things when you're in over your head.  Then I remember that we're talking bitcoin and I feel like security isn't something they should be in over their head with.  Maybe the legal... maybe the office management... maybe the payroll... but certainly not the actual safety of my money.  For me this of course does not extend to FDIC insured accounts, which is why I am ok keeping my money at Bank of America.  I know their security sucks, but when they mess up the US gov't just prints them enough to get out of it.


AWS doesn't even provide a support channel unless you pay an extra ~20% monthly premium.  Basic unpaid support is (a) being able to check their status page, and (b) being able to post to their forums and hoping you can attract enough attention to warrant a reply from an AWS employee.
The AWS mantra is "we had an outage, but it was only us-east, you should always have servers running in us-west too." or "we had data corruption, but it was only in eu-west, you should have all your data in us-east too."  (real scenarios we had to deal with)  It's always a case of the client not using the service properly.

b) if you don't already have and can't afford the required expertise you have no business handling other people's money.  These financial services companies spend millions and millions on lawyers to maintain their regulatory status.  Why would you then skimp on expertise in your IT department?


This is true whether you are at AWS or colo.  AWS does not manage the OS for you, nor the rest of the application stack from there up.
You can't trust their packaged services either.  We used to get random traffic into our servers from their load balancing service all the time.  Upon inspection, we were getting actual client requests for sites they were supposed to be balancing!  Something in their frontend configs were getting out of sync with what VM's they were supposed to be routing to.  Imagine the fun we could have had if we'd actually taken the time to craft a response simulating a login prompt.  ;)

I think AWS has dedicated servers now.  If that counts as extra security?  You're still not providing your own hardware, doing the OS install, etc... 
Has anyone successfully used them for a secure service?  Maybe.  What is secure today isn't tomorrow.  (eg, CloudFlare)  And even once it's compromised a good hacker isn't going to give up their presence until they walk away with all your coins.  (eg, Bitfinex)
AWS has had plenty of security issues in the past.  We periodically had VM transitions forced on us because emergency hypervisor patches needed to be done.
I ran a game 2010 - 2015 that averaged 2.5M users a day.  We started on AWS, it was great for the first few years of growth, but it was a free to play game and we weren't storing any sensitive data.  Once player counts were stable it was cheaper to plan for 2x our highest ever concurrent players and deploy our own hardware.  The problem is that mid-day everyone at AWS is at peak load, so you're competing with everyone else for resources on the same hardware, which forces you to deploy more VM's than you would if you were just getting what you paid for.  This effect clearly showed up in our monitoring as "CPU Steal", which is CPU cycles we were supposed to get, but were actually going to other VM's because the host server was oversold.  Sometimes the CPU steal was as high as 25%!  Which meant just to adjust for peak time we'd have to deploy 20% more servers just to counter the AWS oversell.  Couple that with our own peak traffic increases and it wasn't uncommon for us to have to deploy 2x the servers at peak times.
Oh... and almost forgot.  A couple times their API went down at non-peak times.  So say it's midnight, we're at low load, maybe running with 20% of our average daytime server count.  Then 1 am their API goes offline.  It doesn't come back until 11 am.  During which time we could not deploy any new instances.  ... that was really bad.  Second time it happened we were forced to set a minimum server count high enough to serve an average peak time.  There goes any cost benefits to dynamic scaling.  That was what prompted us to do the math on a colo.  ;)
The cloud stuff is great for certain things.  Not so great for others.  Financial and healthcare services... it's just not worth the risk.
Sorry, that ended up being a lot longer than I intended!

Colocation is the only way to run a platform that requires a high level of security.   Think about it in terms of trying to reduce exposure to security flaws to a minimum.  Using dedicated servers where you don't deploy the hardware yourself opens up exposure to:
* Vulnerabilities at the hardware level with things like hidden or undisclosed remote access devices and/or network packet logging devices
* Vulnerabilities at the software level with exposure to rootkits and backdoors installed in the OS install stages
* Vulnerabilities at the personnel level with potentially hundreds of staff, foreign and domestic, having access to your data.
Then you go and do something stupid like put it in a VM and you add:
* Hypervisor vulnerabilities where random users sharing the same physical hardware with your virtuals can access your virtual server.
* You have zero control over the patching and security management of the underlying Hypervisors and related platform systems.
When you colocate you:
* Provide your own trusted server hardware
* Turn off or otherwise directly manage remote access devices
* Install your own operating systems from trusted sources
* Lock it in a cage, install your own video security system, and don't give the facility the key.
* Provide and configure your own networking hardware.  Firewalls, routers, switches.
* Contract for your own direct Tier 1 connectivity
* Do it all with your own local staff that has to look you in the eye every day

The difference in gas mileage between my '84 F150 and my '04 Expedition is only a couple miles a gallon.  When I was in high school I drove an '81 Champ, frequently got better than 30 MPG.  VW proved most of the efficiency gains the last 10 years have been on paper.
I eat hamburgers instead of steak because steak became too expensive, not because my preference changed.
What are you going to do next?  Swap out cheddar and swiss for kraft singles?  Or swap out pork chops and bacon for hot dogs and spam?
@_date: 2016-06-05 15:03:41
I wasn't arguing that average mileage hasn't gone up, just that it's not enough to make much difference in transportation cost.  My personal experience aside, as fuel mileage has increased, so has the cost and complexity of the vehicles.  As vehicle complexity has increased, so have maintenance expenses. I also suspect vehicles now also have shorter lifespans because they cost so much to repair it doesn't make sense to fix them anymore when something major goes wrong.
Regarding steak and other consumables getting out of reach, you are completely wrong in my opinion.  When the reason preferences change is the price, that is exactly the time we need to NOT swap it out of the basket, as that is exactly the manipulation that makes the CPI worthless as a comparison over time.  I want to know in no uncertain terms how my dollar stacks up to my father's dollar.  I can't know that if todays CPI has me eating flies and maggots while my father was eating steak and vegetables.

I agree that if you don't update it it becomes useless, but replacing out something because it's too expensive rather than because it's just no longer desired kills the entire purpose.  The CPI is the basis for cost of living increases for nearly all the government programs.  Employment, Social Security, Food Stamps, etc.  I know it to be a manipulated pile of crap because I know my cost of living has increased exponentially over the last 8 years while the CPI has only gone up a measly 2-3% a year.  Health care, food, energy, shelter, every single core item has been 5-10% per year.  How is it possible for the overall basket to only be 2-3%?  And which of those items can I realistically swap out for something cheaper?  About the only thing is food, if you don't mind the crap that passes as both edible and affordable.

I'm not sure phones should be in the CPI at all.  The CPI should have a focus on essentials.  Food, shelter, clothes, medical care, etc.
If you want to track technology, today's mobile phones are just computers.  We've had computers for decades now.  Break out the average talk time on today's iphone vs the average time spent doing computing tasks and that $700 iphone is easily split into a $30 phone + $670 computer. And wouldn't a better way to track it be not the cost of the phone up front, but the total cost of ownership, service plan and all?


No, and that's my point.  Go back and re-read the OP.  The Gov't is using the CPI as a measuring stick of quality of life, suggesting you invest in their product, with returns based on CPI, and you won't lose anything over time.  But in core quality of life you DO lose over time.  You get hamburger instead of steak!  That is the manipulation.
With this investment product you'd really invest $100 today, worth 10 servings of hamburger so that you can have 10 servings of flies and maggots in 2026?  Cause you know, that's what gets swapped in after hamburger gets too expensive.  Maybe you don't mind flies and maggots I guess, cuz your latest cell phone can jack into your brain and you can google with a thought.  Now that's real quality of life!

There are ways to incentivize the miners.
To solve the problem with mining of empty blocks full nodes could reject empty blocks outright.
And to solve the problem of a feature users want not getting implemented by miners, full nodes could implement a relay delay on blocks mined by non-compliant miners.  (Which would give a compliant miner a financial incentive to keep up to date.)

Huh?  
Unless all you're doing is dumb mirroring (what Bitcoin currently does.) RAID is meant to add both redundancy AND capacity.  Primarily capacity (speed and storage) - without sacrificing redundancy.  That's not scaling?


DB **replication** is for adding redundancy.  DB **sharding** is for adding capacity.  What dipshit is going to scale their database **storage** (Bitcoin blockchain) by adding a **cache** layer?


Are you suggesting in LN that everyone will be able to verify every single transaction?  I think you might be confused.
And why wouldn't you be able to verify every single transaction?  If that's something that is important to you, you either allocate enough storage locally to store the entire blockchain, or you validate it in chunks, taking it piece by piece off the network, and discarding chunks as you finish validating each progressive piece.

Not going to address the rest of your post, but needed to point out that I don't believe this is correct:


Unless you meant the overall pool of fees?  And you meant priced in $fiat?  Transaction fees could have remained flat in BTC and miners still could have seen an increased benefit from the fees because the miners could collect more by processing more transactions, and further, their profits go up as Bitcoin price goes up.  It's in their best interest to foster a healthy ecosystem.  IE, an ecosystem where people can process lots of transactions so they can collect lots of fees.
You also can't expect that fees should be able to expand to support an infinitely growing pool of miners when TPS is not increasing.  Once a distribution of mining power has been reached that makes it sufficiently difficult to attack the network, users shouldn't have to pay additional fees for the miners to go to war with each other.
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:19:36
I wasn't as clear as I could be.  Yes, lots of people are using it.  However, if fees price out small transactions for a subset of users and those users can't send and receive small transactions like they got accustomed to, then they're also going to have little interest in running a node.

@_date: 2016-11-23 18:36:13
We don't have to, but since he pretty much defined what Bitcoin is, I don't think we should be going around changing the definition.
If you disagree, and think it should be something else, the code is open source and you can make your own coin, name it, and do whatever you want with it.  Many of the rest of us have invested time, money, blood, sweat, and tears into this for years now, believing the ultimate goal was digital cash.  Far too much investment for us to turn on a dime and give up on that goal just because some technological hurdle that is completely manageable has come up.  LN will help realize that goal, and I for one am very excited to see it happen.

If you mined for peanuts in 2011, 2012, 2013, then sold in 2014, 2015, you'd have some pretty serious gains to be paying.

Wise words indeed.  Good thing there's Bitcoin.


It's front and center on bitcoin.org:  "Fast Peer to Peer Transactions" &amp; "Low Processing Fees"  Sounds like what I want it to be and do is not another matter at all.  In fact it sounds like I'm advocating delivery of what is being actively promoted and promised.

Both Bitcoin and Credit Cards record the transaction to the network immediately.
Credit cards don't "confirm" for 90 days.  That's the point at which you can no longer claim a chargeback as a card holder.  Up until then the tx can easily be reversed.
Bitcoin is around 30 mins if your fee was appropriate.

Eh, I suspect most central banks have a bit of a round table.  Not really certain the couple of core devs that have commit and release control are all that dissimilar.
Sure, everyone can propose ideas and develop them.  But it's only an elite few that can actually put them into play.
Next you might argue that it's open source, so go ahead and fork it.  But people are afraid of the economic damage that might do, and no one wants to be responsible for the destruction of their own investment, let alone everyone else's.  The parallel is that you don't really have to use USD except for taxes.  You can barter and use gold and use other forms of tender.  But no one does because it's not economically feasible and if enough people did it it too would cause economic damage.
So we seem to have a central control system and they have not kept up with growth.  I'd argue that an organization like that is necessary, BUT it needs to be aligned with user interests, be transparent enough to convince the users and miners that what it is doing is in their interests, and move fast enough to keep up with adoption.

Recording a non-existant buy could easily trigger an audit years later when you realize you've been reporting owning X number of coins and you've sold all you have but on paper should still have Y.  The IRS would be looking for the missing sell, trying to get in on the gains and it'd be on you to figure out what went wrong.  Plus it'd affect all of your taxes since the error occurred and you'd have to do a bunch of re-filing.

Sort of.  You have to report the cost basis of what you've sold.  Hence, you're reporting the purchase at the same time you're reporting the sale.  I guess with that in mind you're right that they'd have no idea after you've sold it all that you should have had more, but still would look bad in an audit when they can't correlate a dollar expense in your bank account with the bitcoin purchase that never really happened.

@_date: 2015-07-10 21:22:28
Going to have to agree to disagree.
If you are a web-based business (arguably main street as well) and don't accept credit/debit cards on the visa or mastercard network you're not going to be doing enough business to keep the doors open.
Every year you accept credit cards you'll receive a new rate sheet from your merchant bank and every year it'll be "accept these new higher percentages, or you can leave." 
You do not get the option of not accepting "rewards" cards, which cost the merchant an extra... 1%.  You accept them all of them or none of them.
Really hoping bitcoin changes this.
(merchant that has paid visa/mastercard over $300k over the years)
Edit: I guess the moral of the story is - if you like the merchant, pay with bitcoin/cash.  If it's an evil corporation that is fleecing you already, pay with your rewards card.

Seems like it should be possible for the Bitcoin network to keep a copy of the most recent transaction for each open channel on a few nodes.  This would probably be too much data for every node to have a complete copy, but similar to how database sharding works, or similar to how RAID works for storage, you could split the storage of the transactions across nodes on the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:35:48
No, it's for privacy and fungibility.  I don't care if the individual transactions are anonymous.  (Eg, I don't care if the person I'm transacting with knows who I am.)  I do care that random third parties not be privy to my transactions and that my money be fungible.
@_date: 2016-02-21 06:23:39


Means the transaction fee would have to be over 272 times (3000/11) what it is today for the miners to break even.  That would just push people to stretch out the use of the channels even further, which would result in another increase in fees, ad infinitum until no one settles on the blockchain anymore.
@_date: 2016-02-24 06:16:14
I got the analogy straight from the Lightning Network devs.
And if they're regular bitcoin transactions, how come Blockstream has to release new clients before the LN transactions themselves can be supported?  They're adding feature after feature, because Bitcoin today doesn't do what they need to roll out the Lightning Network.  Yeah, try again indeed.
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:12:57
* Point remains, just replace "vendor" with "hub".  If you open a channel with a hub, then change your mind and want your money back for whatever reason you're paying the "bitcoin as a settlement network" transaction fees to do so.
* I get that you both get signed copies of the new transactions with each transaction iteration. I think what I may be confused with is if the Bitcoin network keeps copies of these, or if you have to be on the network around settlement time to submit your copy.  If it's the former, then the network is going to be storing a whole lot of data, maybe enough that it may as well have been on the Bitcoin network to start with.  If it's the latter, then if you're not online around settlement time then the other person can take advantage.
* I wasn't suggesting hubs would be interested in closing channels prematurely.  Rather that a DDOS could prevent them from closing them in a timely fashion.
* No, but they can lose all theirs.  IE, open channels don't seem to have a concept of a cold wallet.  If you're not on the LN network, you can't transact, and if you're on the LN network, you're also on the internet.  So what happens if a hub is compromised?  Would be interesting to find out.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:35:59
For sure.  So is Bitcoin.  It cracks me up though to be accused of spreading FUD, when I got all my points directly from the video linked from the official Lightning Network site.  Should be easy to mark it as historical or inaccurate.  Fact is that none of the documentation there even mentions onion routing for hubs.
It's also a pretty big deal that not only did the initial devs working on it not think transaction privacy was important, they were completely 180 on it and were all excited that the hubs would be able to sell the data!  To me that speaks volumes as to the original motivation and intent behind the project.

Chain of custody?  They had admin access to the silk road website.  They could have easily taken that, found an unknown vulnerability, and injected all kinds of evidence for SDNY to "find" later.  And if they could have done that, then ditto for evidence on his laptop and elsewhere.  These guys probably had access to all kinds of zero-day / unknown exploits of common operating systems for use in the course of investigation.  In my opinion, the rogue agents soured ALL of the evidence sourced from anything other than Ross's own mouth.

They did this to me in early 2015 on a rise from ~$220 to ~$230+.  Rather than getting the bitcoins delivered on the projected delivery day I got a cancellation notice and the funds sent back to my account.  By the time the returned funds arrived back in my account the price was $240+, so I missed a run of around $20/coin, or an about 9% gain.  As a broker, this is illegal.  They need to do all their compliance checks BEFORE accepting the money, not a week later.  How they continue to get away with it is beyond me.

Sorry if I gave the impression that people would actually put their names in the transactions.  I kind of assumed that in the context of bitcoin it was understood that transactions were made using bitcoin addresses, not names.  Is this easier to grasp?
* Power: you know what addresses are paying what addresses and how much


The devs specifically said that hubs could refuse to relay transactions in their early 2015 SF talk.  It's in the video linked from the LN website.


Yes you do.  Running a hub requires you to provide the "float" as transactions pass through.

There's no logical reason a block increase and LN development can't happen in parallel.  Software managers tackle far more complex problems every day, especially considering no one knows when LN will be feature complete and available.
Core knows and agrees blocks need a boost.  They agreed in Hong Kong to 2 MB by 2017, and their own LN devs say we need to get to 133 MB blocks for everyone to be able to use LN.  See:  - 33:50
So what's the difference if you do the block size transition sometime in the remaining 10 months of 2016 instead of six months into 2017?  Only thing I can think of is that it may "entice" more people into using LN.  Which, coming full-circle, would be great.  **If it were guaranteed to be available.** I have huge respect for the core devs, but wonder what is the backup plan if LN doesn't pan out and full-blocks are a regular thing and fees get out of control?
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:20:20
I mentioned in my previous post that I'd prefer expanding capacity in Bitcoin, rather than LN.  In my opinion it's a "keep it simple" kind of thing.  So I was speaking from the viewpoint that Bitcoin COULD also have the same capacity, given the same focus LN is getting.
To me LN looks a lot like an attempt to bootstrap a new business model.  You have to ask yourself, who benefits?

Not acting is frequently an action in and of itself.  If a semi is going the wrong way, coming at you head on, do you not try to slow down or dodge it?  Or you going to just stay in your lane at full speed?
Core has already "agreed" to a 2MB appeasement fork.  They're just pushing it out long enough for LN to be "required" in the meantime.  Watch the video I posted above.  They say that 133MB blocks are "very reasonable". 
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:32:45

I agree, in OSS it's common for the details to be worked out as development proceeds.


On this I'm not so sure.  Blocks seem mostly full.  How long before the transaction fees get high enough to where it's cheaper (conversion fees, exchange accessibility, and transaction fees all included) to transact via the next highest market cap altcoin?  When that happens the door opens to a MySpace-&gt;Facebook type event.  How far away this is seems difficult to predict.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:16:42
With blocks filling up + the 72 hour transaction limit + the new 0.12.0 transaction mempool limit all you really have to do is set a low fee.  If your fee is low enough that it doesn't get mined, then the transaction gets dropped and you keep your funds.
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:35:13
Sounds like if it makes it into Lightning that would alleviate most of my concerns.  I have been super worried about it after watching the LN devs San Francisco presentation where they say one of the incentives to run a node may be to sell the transaction data to marketers!
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:49:32
I suppose you could argue that nothing on the internet is peer to peer, because no one pays for direct lines to each of the destination IP's they interact with.  But that was not the layer which I was addressing.  My definition of peer to peer is my PC opens a TCP socket, your PC opens a TCP socket, we send data back and forth.
You can use the analogy of the differences between TorChat and Google Talk.  TorChat sends the messages directly between PC's.  Google Talk sends the messages to their central server, where they index it and log it and use it to learn about you, then they forward it to the recipient who is also directly connected to their server.
LN is the Google Talk model.
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:14:59
I think he is right in a lot of ways.  Most facts he used a period.  Most questions or unknowns he used "If" or a question mark at the end of the sentence.


I'm not sure about that, with many of the features going into Bitcoin in early 2016 being specifically to enable LN on Bitcoin, there are many Blockstream devs working on LN indirectly.  Yes, everyone benefits.  We also know first to market frequently realizes an insurmountable market share.


This concerns me because the busiest hubs are going to be the ones that have the most connections, thus creating the shortest hops between parties, and thus are going to require the most liquidity.  I keep hearing this argument that "anyone can run a LN node" but reality is that running a successful node will require a lot of liquidity and require top-notch security.  This is not much different from the natural barriers today preventing Joe Sixpack from opening his own bank.


The biggest question I have right now is why hub and spoke?  Look at how websites on the internet work.  They effectively have a split of a "directory lookup" service (DNS) combined with a peer to peer protocol for the actual transaction. (HTTPS)   It is efficient, with logs only generated on the systems of the two parties involved.
You might argue that the hub and spoke model is required for many transactions with many parties to happen within a single channel, but consider that Bitcoin already has the ability to have multiple recipients on a transaction and that the channel could be opened with a single recipient, and additional recipients can simply be appended to the shared multi-output transaction as new transactions on the channel are made.  While not as efficient as hub and spoke across a pool of millions of transactions, there would be no exposure to middle men, far less privacy exposure, and no additional fees required.
The hub and spoke model is technically more complex, has more points of failure, and is highly likely to give power to the hubs in ways we have only begun to expore.

I agree that LN solves a lot of the problems Bitcoin (and bitcoin) is facing, my problem is with HOW it solves it.  What new problems does it create?  I know for instance that LN transactions as promoted are not direct peer to peer.  They want you to use LN hubs which are privy to all the details of the transactions passing through them and will likely take fees along the way.
I'd like to hear an explanation from someone far smarter than I am about why we can't make transactions truly peer to peer.  My connection to reddit is https, thus I know there are no intermediaries that I have not approved of.  How about a Bitcoin equivalent of DNS + HTTPS?  Look the person up (DNS), then transact directly. (HTTPS)

Reading your link there, to disadvantages add:
* If it costs an extravagant fee on a settlement-only bitcoin network to open and then again to close a channel, what happens when you open a channel with a vendor, have a bad experience on the first small transaction, (cup of coffee?) then want to close the channel to get access to your funds back?  You will have just spent two large transaction fees for what would be a single small fee on a bitcoin network expanded to work like it does today.
* You have to carefully watch all your open channels to make sure that you close them prior to the timeout period with your most recent signed transaction, or risk the other party closing them out using previously signed transactions.  (seems more of a merchant risk?)
* Linked to the previous point, preventing closing channels prior to the timeout period becomes an attack vector.  (either by DDOS'ing your network, or by DDOS'ing the Bitcoin network?)
* Payment channel partners become a central point of attack.  Eg, if they are compromised it is similar in scope to a hot wallet compromise.
Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of these.

Incentives to run a hub might be money, power, or altruism.
* Money: you can charge fees for transactions you relay
* Power: you know who's paying who and how much
* Money: you can sell the transaction data you collect (who's paying who and how much)
* Power: you can refuse certain transactions.  the refusals will likely get routed around but might cost more or get delayed
* Altruism: if you have a lot of capital to risk (it takes capital to run a node and running a node risks loss of this capital in hacking or software bug scenarios) and want to let other people use that capital free of charge, you could run a node at your own expense, with zero fees, and choose to turn off logging.

@_date: 2016-02-28 22:54:13
Adding to the complexity, there's more to it than just route discovery, you also need fee discovery.  For instance, a payment considering three different routes needs to be able to calculate the toll on a complete per transaction basis so as to pay the least amount of fees on the overall transaction.  If you don't do fee discovery and enforcement somehow then an individual running multiple nodes could actually create traps, where they bring an initial transaction in offering a negative fee, only to route it to another hub they control with very high fees, netting large gains.
I'd like to find some documentation about how this is planned to work, but haven't found any anywhere yet.

Maybe a bit counter-intuitive, but if you really want to just wait it out and reduce the shutdowns/crashes you can slow down the cpu and/or process to reduce the heat generation.
On the CPU side, I'd check out the bios and see if you can drop down the CPU mhz.  Alternately, many laptops have power profile management that allows you to reduce performance.  (usually to save battery, but in this case would cause your CPU to run cooler.)
To reduce the process priority you just right-click on the bitcoin process in the task manager (ctrl-alt-del and select task manager) and "set priority" to "low".  It'll run slower, but cooler.
If you're on linux, use "nice" when starting the process, or "renice" to change the priority after you've already started the process.

Lightning is to Bitcoin what Gift cards are to US dollars.  You have to pay a fee to pre-load it up with funds, that you then whittle down over time until it's time to pay another fee to load it up with funds again.
Are gift cards US dollars?
Add: ugh, -1.  To those that are down voting, let me add that I got the analogy directly from the Lightning Network devs, and that until the agreed-upon Bitcoin transactions are broadcast, Lightning Network transactions constitute a private ledger between parties, exactly like a gift card has between client and merchant.  In terms of functionality, this is very divergent from what most people today consider to be "regular Bitcoin".
I might also add - there's nothing wrong with gift cards.  You just have to understand what you're getting into.

I'd love to be wrong on this one, but what multi-hop multi-path routing system have you ever used that isn't aware of at least the last hop and the final destination?  How would that even be possible to function?  Take A -&gt; B -&gt; C.  How could A possibly send something through B to C without telling B it needs to go to C and not D?  Consider that A is not aware of the link between B and C in advance.  Consider also that the system needs enough information to be able to route around failures.
And since the final destination must be preserved at each hop, how could you possibly argue that there is no basis for refusal?  All you have to know is that the final destination is some destination you don't agree with.


This is correct, but I said you were risking your capital, not lending it out.  The risk is systemic.  Your node has to be online, the software has to be secure.  If anyone compromises your node, your capital goes poof.

I was thinking that Datacenter Edition would truly be run in Datacenters primarily.  This would work just fine if the Wikipedias, Netcrafts, Pirate Bays, Universities, &amp; Internet Archives of the world each run a node or two.  320 GB blocks would take around 500 Mbps ingress, probably more egress to provide services to the Home editions out there. So for bandwidth and hardware you're probably looking at a couple grand a month.
By suggesting that it be spread geographically and politically I simply meant strategically to avoid government interference and related exposure.
I think by the time Bitcoin is large enough to be needing those 320 GB blocks everyone will be depending on it enough that - similar to how dependent we are on the internet and how the various routers and nodes and isp's work together, there will be cooperation in the operation of Bitcoin.

On the first point, I still think the incentive to mine is higher with more transactions contributing fees into the network, rather than less.

Does the transfer between A and C require any trust of B?  Does creating the A to C HTLC require an on-chain transaction?
Using your TCP example it seems like we need the equivalent of BGP4, but it seems like the size of a bitcoin LN routing table would be several orders of magnitude larger than the internet routing tables due to the ability with IP space to logically collapse entries by ASN/ISP/subnet.  Thus would have significant memory and performance requirements?

Seems like if you want to shave some on the transaction broadcast side, you could limit what you accept and re-transmit to transactions deemed likely to be included in the next X blocks, where you could set X to whatever you want, but have some minimum.
This would push responsibility for the remaining transactions to the clients originating them, and then those clients would actually have more visibility into whether their transactions were going to be accepted into a block or not.
Add: **THEN** you use these remaining transactions in the block building scheme, and cut the 12% as well.
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:58:22
I'm not sure how unique my thoughts are, but the Chinese have indicated that they're ok up to around 4MB blocks.  What that more or less translates to I think is around 8MB of data per block, as transactions are currently broadcast independently, and then again as part of each block.  (IE, twice) So if they're agreeing to 8MB of data per block, then with thin blocks we're able to have 8x the capacity we have today.  The other benefit is that with thin blocks the transactions stream in as they are executed, not in a big burst of data, so you can actually operate on a lower bandwidth connection and still be competitive in terms of block propagation times.
The drawback I've read is that with thin blocks, if you do not already have all the transactions in a block when the block comes in, then you have to fetch them.  Then it becomes a question of which takes longer, downloading a full 4 MB block, or grabbing a few transactions you might have missed?  That too, is a bandwidth question, which in a low-bandwidth scenario, the latter clearly wins.
So 8x is roughly what the Chinese have agreed is palatable today.  I think once they see the lower bandwidth requirements with streaming the transactions, they may in fact agree to far larger blocks going forward, as the limitations become more computational in nature.
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:00:05
I don't think they've finished the specs.  I read somewhere it doesn't have the distributed channel to channel routing figured out yet.
If I understand it right, you can open a channel party A to party B directly, but party A nor party B can't pay party C via that channel, instead requiring settlement on the blockchain before those funds can be used.  I think this becomes an efficiency issue?
Edit/Add: I seem to get downvoted every time I mention this.  Maybe someone who understands it better could point out how/why I might be mistaken?

I agree that it's not going to function long term if the current growth holds, but why artificially kill it now before the next generation currency layer can be built upon it?

I agree for the most part.  Just wish the party developing Bitcoin and limiting transaction space in Bitcoin and the party developing LN were not one and the same.  Whether anyone admits it or not it ends up influencing roadmap decisions and even can influence decisions to kill (or mitigate) one product in favor of another.  This is a common theme in corporate boardrooms, where if there are two competing products at a company, one gets killed off or otherwise merged into the other.  Usually to the detriment of the consumer using the product slated for retirement.
It feels to me like Bitcoin is getting retired in favor of Lightning Network.  Or more accurately, being shaped specifically to serve the Lightning Network.

I used to code a lot.  2010 - 2011 I was a combination of management and "fill-in-where-needed" on a game that reached overnight viral success, going from virtually zero daily players to over 1 million daily players in a span of about 6 months.  You can imagine the scaling issues you might run into, taking over someone else's project when it hasn't been designed for scale.  We were looking at MANY possible ways to scale and developing as many as we could in parallel so that we didn't piss off our users and lose momentum.  Absolutely each change needs to have a risk assessment, but in that scenario where a competitor could take a growing client base at any time, the real risk comes from not taking risk and being unresponsive.  (Webcrawler/Lycos, Friendster/MySpace?)
2012-2013 I got the itch to code up a hobby project, which ended up being BTC-TC (btct.co, BTC Trading Corp) ... it did well, was popular, grew fast, etc.  But the SEC didn't like it much and asked me to shut it down.  :)

Yes, but what end?
The "end" with LN in it's current state is no different from banking.  Trusted third parties, routing transactions on behalf of users directly connected.  Until LN has the ability to route transactions itself in a decentralized manner it won't be.  And... when it finally can route transactions my bet is that the resources it will take to run it won't be much different than if you expanded Bitcoin itself anyway.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:21:38
Growth of the network is going to gradually price out smaller operators running full nodes anyway.  Even the LN devs know this and calculated that with everyone using only the Lightning Network 133 MB blocks will be necessary for everyone to use Bitcoin.  See:

When it's that big?  Not really.  There are enough Wikipedia / Internet Archive / etc organizations out there to run plenty of nodes spread around the globe and operated by different companies, people, organizations, etc.

It's pretty much inevitable if you want to grow the network, either Bitcoin itself centralizes somewhat with larger blocks, or LN centralizes somewhat with big hubs.

$1-$2 per tx means it's time to either expand the capacity of the raw network, or use another competing currency.
Just for fun, some sample numbers - Since miners can make $1,000 either by doing 10,000 transactions at $0.10, or by doing 100 transactions at $10, I'd rather see them doing the former rather than the latter.  They might even make more doing the 10,000 transactions if they were able to charge a reasonable $0.15 instead.  So which would you prefer?  A network with direct access for the common man?   Or a network only the privileged use directly?

No, with a regular bitcoin transaction I can pay someone when they are offline.  Multisig is not required.  Time lock transactions are not required.  I just plug their address into my client and hit send.
LN requires deposits into a channel, multisig, time locking, and for recipients to be online in order to negotiate the agreed-upon balances of each party.

I'd be happy to pay a reasonable fee if my backups failed.
There are other automated ways to handle it though.  I designed the 2FA recovery on BTC Trading Corp (btct.co) to just be a 30 day wait, where email notifications were sent at intervals and notices were placed in your account such that you could cancel it at any time if you (or more importantly someone else) had requested it in error.  It worked really well and required zero human intervention.

I'll try to pencil this out.
Credit card... the initial transaction (what most consider the payment) happens instantly, is really only a promise to pay later, and most people expect delivery instantly.  However, that transaction is reversible for **90 days** after that transaction - for almost any reason the card holder can come up with.  In effect, final settlement on a credit card payment doesn't happen for 90 days.
Bitcoin... initial transaction (unconfirmed) is very much like the "promise" to pay, **BUT** final settlement with 6 confirmations is merely 60 minutes later!
This is a short enough time frame for a vendor to wait for settlement before they ship out a product.  As such, Bitcoin is a far better system for anyone shipping product, and I guarantee you they are not wincing as they wait the 60 minutes for confirmation.

For an individual, currency can encompass both cash in hand and your bank account.  Cash transacts from person to person, peer to peer.  Your bank account transacts from you to your bank, and then your bank to your peer, or your bank to another bank.
With this understanding, Bitcoin itself is cash.  Lightning Network's hub and spoke intermediary system is like a bank account with the benefit that you don't have to trust the bank.  (Because LN protects you from asset seizure, etc.)
I'd like to see an alternative available that settles on Bitcoin and still works like cash.

I agree efficiency vs cost vs trust can frequently be a trade-off.  It'd be a lot cheaper and easier to do multi-million dollar deals with just a discussion and a handshake rather than pay a legal team $500/hr to assemble a contract - but that incurs too much risk.  LN is a huge improvement on this no doubt.

Actual quote.
So if the LN devs see 133 MB blocks as reasonable for use with Lightning, then why not for regular transactions **until lightning is actually available?**  You hit the nail on the head.  They're trying to butter people up for LN, which is unfortunate because they are pushing it as a hub and spoke model, where it really should be peer to peer.
So why hub and spoke?  They allude to a motivation around 42:00 where they discuss that one of the incentives is because then the hubs can watch all the transactions and:


In other words, they seem to be intentionally building it to remove privacy that would be inherent with a direct peer to peer system.

Reasonable doubt doesn't apply in an appeal, by Ross, of his guilty verdict, if it makes it back before a jury?

My opinion is that the actions and behavior of the agents, including proof of their direct insider (admin) access to Ross' computer systems such as the website, etc, gives them opportunity and motive to plant evidence.  As new evidence which was not permitted in his first trial, that should be plenty to get him a new trial.

Yes.  Maybe even enough to make mining unprofitable as rewards get smaller.  Lightning hurts network security two ways.  First by reducing the incentive to mine, and second by shifting a large percentage of the transactions off chain where they aren't confirmed by the overall network.
Doesn't make it a show stopper, LN may be just what we need for small transactions IF we can't get Bitcoin itself to scale.  I'd still prefer to see Bitcoin itself handling all these transactions, if for nothing else than the KISS principal.

Like anyone would intentionally throw away $20 - $60 just to do 1,000 small transactions?  And -- Even if they did, that's real money a miner made for the favor, money they can add to the higher transaction fees already culled for people wanting priority transactions.  
I don't advocate for free transactions, but the fact is that the more transactions fit into a block, the more the miners make per block and by the time you multiply it out, it's not exactly chump change.
Another side note - Credit card transaction fees are typically $0.15 - $0.30 plus a percentage between 1%-4%.  Meaning that, for small transactions, bitcoin is quickly catching up with the cost of transacting using credit cards.  When the average bitcoin transaction exceeds the cost of the average credit card transaction there isn't going to be much benefit to merchants to use it anymore.
However the devs do it, with SegWit, bigger blocks, or whatever, more transaction capacity ultimately means more money for miners.

I've read several summaries.  Most recently here: 
I've also read the recent thread here on Reddit where Maxwell admitted LN has no routing infrastructure in place yet.  (It's being worked on?)
From what I've read, the only way to route channel to channel right now is to have a trusted third party in the middle coordinating everything.  Sounds a lot like a bank, no?
Sure, you can go point to point with it.  Open channel, make payments, close channel.  That's powerful, but not compelling in and of itself.  Most merchants are perfectly capable of issuing gift cards or letting their users carry a balance to accomplish the same thing.
I'm curious to see what they come up with for the routing, but if my experience with BGP is any indicator, the routing is likely to be complex and resource intensive.

Sorry, that is not my intent.  I think we started with this:


Which to me looked like you had arrived at the conclusion that my belief that not everyone needs to run a node means that I don't care about trust or privacy of the users.
I do care quite a bit.  I'll try this again.  You can't trust a currency without fungibility.  You can't have fungibility without privacy.  Thus to me fungibility is the connection between the two.  There is another kind of trust, that maybe you were referring to?  That is, that of a user being able to trust the data flowing into their client.  To that end, whether you keep the entire transaction history or just the last 6 months, I don't think matters much as long as your client is adequately distributing it's requests across the network and validating the results it's pulling in.  Kind of like bittorrent I think, you can get parts and pieces from all over the place and still validate the integrity of the end result via hash.

Wasn't trying to be snide at all.  For sure the kids didn't do it by themselves.  Most likely they had a lawyer or accountant parent.  Regardless, kids do start non-profits.
You are of course 100% correct that if Blockstream were founded as a non-profit they would not have had access to the same funding options.  I'd argue though that the Bitcoin Foundation has had funding dry up as a result of their mismanagement.  Who in their right mind would donate?  Blockstream on the other hand, with several superstar devs and a decent roadmap might have stood a better chance.  Unfortunately VC money usually comes with strings.  No idea what they are in this case, but it'd be interesting to find out.

I think we'll just have to agree to disagree. A non-profit wouldn't have brought them in as much money (which we agree on) but I am not convinced it wouldn't have been enough to live comfortably with a living wage.  It seems more likely to me they looked at the two options, saw the dollar signs, and decided that whatever compromises they had to make (maybe there actually weren't any, but we will never know) they were ok with.  I probably would have done the same thing myself if the compromises were minimal, $70+ million is a lot of money for a small group like that.

I didn't make an actual purchase, but I did click to the order page.  To complete the transaction they call your mobile phone number and give you a 4 digit code you have to plug in.  They also state that the mobile phone number you use when you place the order has to match the number on record with the issuing bank.
Other than a hacker calling up the issuing bank and changing the number on file, I don't see how they could successfully pull off a fraudulent transaction?

I was president of the board for a local cooperative food buying and distribution org for a few years.  Then I worked with a nationally recognized donation channel Dell uses for several years.  (10 years maybe?) Like I said, harder than an LLC, but way easier than a public company.  Probably on par with a C-Corp in terms of financial reporting, taxes, required meetings, etc.  All of which I have also worked for at an executive level at one time or another.  (So I've worked non-profit, LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp, and publicly traded C-Corp...)
All I was saying is that if they wanted limited personal liability, a non-profit would provide it without the pressure of making a profit or having to answer to a pitchfork wielding public wondering what your motivations really are.

Would it affect your thoughts at all if the Lightning Network devs themselves came out and said 100 MB blocks are very reasonable?
Well, they did.  
Joseph Poon &amp; Thaddeus Dryja
~33:50 slide: "Bitcoin Can Scale"
They present 133 MB Blocks / 3 Mbps as what it would take for the world to use Lightning Network, which he says: "...is very reasonable."
So the question is, now that Adam agreed the block size needs to grow in Hong Kong, and their LN devs have known and presented since early 2015 it needs to grow for Lightning, then why are they waiting until 2017 to actually do it?
Whatever the motivation, Classic has had a huge role in opening everyone's eyes and putting pressure on Core to deliver what everyone (Core included) seems to agree is inevitable.

Looks like a lot of hard work went into this release.  Playing devil's advocate a bit here:
Perspective of a regular Joe who just wants to use Bitcoin from his phone: blocks are nearly full, the system is running at nearly 100% capacity, transaction fees are going up, transaction speed is going down.  Let's see how this latest release addresses my needs:


Doh - Deletes my transaction if I don't pay enough fees.


Woot - Increases access because now maybe more people will run clients my phone can use to snag transactions.


Doh - If everyone does this, I can't even use Bitcoin on my phone anymore.  And if someone has this turned on maybe I don't want to use their lame slow connection anyway.


Not sure.  But now when it turns out that doubling the fee my client recommended still wasn't high enough, I can at least make it 4x!


Woot - Privacy.  Good.


Woot - The only feature in this release making my transaction confirm any faster than 11.2?
I'd like to see the devs take a more Joe-user view of some of the major issues.
* Bitcoins are not fungible.  (and "mixers" do not fix the problem.)
* Transactions are not making it into blocks in a timely fashion.
Onwards and upwards.

While yes, this is possible, my understanding is that they did it to prevent transactions of the wrong amounts from showing up in their wallet.  By requiring bip70 they can (a) ensure transactions are the correct value before relaying them and (b) restrict usage to wallets that make it more difficult to screw up the transaction.
I can imagine underpayments and overpayments being quite a headache for their customer service teams.

You could take BTC with you but using a Bitcoin ATM you'll probably end up with a sub-optimal exchange rate overall.
You might be able to come out ahead if you use localbitcoins while you're there.
Most credit cards will auto-convert for you at a sub-optimal exchange rate, and add on a foreign transaction charge to boot.  Cards that do not have the foreign transaction charge have a high annual fee.
If you have a bank account in Canada you might come out ahead selling via BitQuick.
Best exchange rates I've seen have been via USForex, but you have to have a bank account on both sides to do that.

Correct, they did not freeze my funds.  I had none left.  I'd sold all my BTC.  They cancelled my attempt to buy it back and closed my account.
They did cause significant losses in the process because they held my funds for over a week and by the time they returned them it was too late to execute the same purchase elsewhere.  BTC has not seen the same lows since.  (I executed the buy at around $223 if I remember correctly)
My account was verified, I had been making large purchases and sales over the last year.  I have probably paid them thousands in fees.  I am well known to many in California and Oregon technology business circles.  I am a frequent volunteer for many local organizations.  The SEC and a forensic accountant went through the last three years of my financials recently for the BTC-TC investigation.  (everyone knows 2013 was a witch-hunt year for anyone and everyone offering Bitcoin services.)  I've never been charged with a crime.  I am a VP level exec at my day job.
Initially they stated that it was their bank that made the decision.  In a subsequent reply they mistakenly admitted it was their customer service staff that made the decision.  I asked Coinbase if there was anything I could give them (documents, FBI background check, etc) to change their mind.  Instead they decided to start stealth closing the ticket without replying.
I let them know that I would be filing a complaint with the California Department of Business Oversight.  No reply.  Doesn't make much sense to me TBH, but to each their own I guess.

I'm not confused and whether they have it in their hands or not the whole time is immaterial.  They got the money, or they wouldn't have been able to send it back.  All they have to do is set aside the BTC when a user places a buy order and deliver it when the ACH hits their account.  The ACH did not fail.  Coinbase failed.  
How or why?  That's what I'd like to know.  Why undo transactions like that and screw your customer in the process?  Maybe if they don't actually have the BTC they should tell customers that instead of taking their money from their account via ACH and failing to deliver?  Personally I'd be fine with that, I could just go elsewhere to place my order.
There's a hundred ways they could improve their process to not screw the customer and yet here we are a year later and customers are still getting screwed.

Hard fork only seems dangerous because ETH f'd it up so bad.  If you get the community on board and plan months in advance to activate on X block if Y percentage of blocks are Z version, the risk is mitigated for the most part.


The "database" was a cluster of 40 servers holding account records for around 30M users.  You usually can't just roll back the structural data changes and other conversions, it'd take a week to restore that amount of data from backups, and in the process you'd be losing everyone's progress since the last backup.  More likely you'd just be down and all your users would be gone.  Risk seems about the same to me financially, in numbers of users affected, and in risk of losing "customers".  In fact, arguably, a Bitcoin rollback would be easier.  The database is orders of magnitude smaller.

You're right, I didn't know the math was so hard on bandwidth requirements.
On 1Mbps you can transfer 60-80MB in 10 minutes.  Transferring a 1.7MB SegWit block a few times plus the steady relay of transactions simply isn't anywhere near that.

Instant works fine if you accept the double spend risk.  No different than accepting credit cards with risk of chargebacks, except with double spend you know within a few hours whereas chargeback you don't know for 90 days.
I have my bitcoind set to process fees for around 5 confirmations and still have seen fees north of $0.50.  I assume because of the bytecount involved, but I have no control over that.
And a 2 MB block is not a quick hack.  1 MB blocks were the quick hack years ago.  2MB and larger blocks were always the intended progression, assumed a given by most involved up until 2015 when all of a sudden it wasn't and the only good reason anyone can see is the concept of LN was imagined and certain devs realized it'll never be adopted unless they can manufacture an obscene fee event.  Which is pretty much where we are today, though now it looks like SegWit isn't going to get activated which means we get neither larger blocks nor LN.  Genius.

I have an 8 year old laptop running one of my nodes.  It was an underpowered (lightweight and thin) model from the start.  Still has plenty of CPU and storage left to process more transactions.

Users aren't running nodes because they don't feel like they want to support the network anymore.  They're disillusioned for whatever reason.  To me it feels like it's become an elites only club for users that don't mind exorbitant fees.
This might just be temporary pain, all relieved when SegWit and LN are out.  I certainly hope this is the case...

@_date: 2016-10-27 02:36:38
I completely agree with most everything you say.
But there's no reason not scale with the tools we have now to allow increased adoption today.  Any loss in node count due to increased resource requirements will be offset by the influx of newcomers. 
I ran an online game for a few years with over 2M daily players.  Joined the company early on, before public launch.  When we were scaling in the early days we had to make a lot of compromises.  Not everything we did was the absolute best way to do it, in lots of cases we had to just throw hardware at it when better software was the real long term solution.  Because of that we grew from nothing, to a huge success, and later had the resources to very carefully implement better, more efficient software.

There's still a ton of things broken with the internet's UI.  Email addresses are gobbledy gook.  Web URLs are gobbledy gook.  Computers are still non-intuitive.  People have adjusted to use them as-is, but you can't assume for a second it hasn't slowed adoption.  My grandparents are the perfect example of people that never adopted the internet because it doesn't make any sense, and they are otherwise very smart and savvy people.

It cracks me up that the LN devs admitted this 100MB block truth a year and a half ago, yet blockstream still refused a boost to 2 MB as full blocks approached.  There is no reason not to have quickly done a bump to 2 MB blocks.  Everyone argues it would have caused a whole bunch of full nodes to shut down, hurting the network, but they don't even consider that increased adoption would offset this as new users find bitcoin and choose to contribute.
I wonder too how many people shut down their full nodes, disgusted at the rising fees and lack of transaction growth.
Edit: Love the downvotes... Truth hurts I suppose.

Without CLTV in LN you would have to remember (I assume you'd do this somehow in software, which would have to be kept online at all times.) to broadcast transactions at the right time or the counterparty could steal your funds.  Not exactly an option...  I'd consider not making it easy for a counterparty to steal funds a requirement.  Wouldn't you?
I'll add that frequently one invention will drive further inventions.  So what if LN as an idea came first if it wasn't functionally complete without some underlying innovation?  You need legs to hold up a table, it won't just float midair.

Yes.  He was correct that $0.13 is the current going rate.  Which incidentally is a lot higher than $0.05.
I'm not convinced he was correct assuming that $0.13 right now in the middle of the night also means it's $0.13 in the middle of the day.

Coinbase is not excellent.  They have repeatedly unwound transactions to their financial benefit and shut down accounts without giving any reason.

I think the problem with BTCjam is that people with good credit aren't going to use it.  In most cases their local banks are going to have have better terms like lower interest and longer terms.  I created an account, connected everything up, but ultimately went with a general purpose loan from the local credit union.
Edit/Add - Logged in and went to create a new $20,000 loan.  I have a "C" rating it looks like.  On a 12 month loan it gives me a 5% loan origination fee ($1000) and a 6.75% per MONTH rate.  Over 12 months you would pay back the $20,000 plus approx $9,785.  Seems like a nearly 50% APR?  Yikes.

I don't understand how/why this is even a difficult problem?  The Gov't has a plethora of social handout programs already... what's one more?

Use social security records and send a check to everyone that paid in in the last year.
Use census data to send an amount to every address that responded, proportional to how many people lived at that address.  (Bonus - it encourages people to respond to the census.)
I just don't think this is a problem they actually want to solve.  After all, the Federal Reserve is a private company owned by the banks.  I'm sure they're perfectly happy with how they have it setup now.

Greetings fellow 2011 Bitcoin user / redditor for 20 days.
The process of transitioning to a fee market was already built into the system before the blocksize limit became an issue.  Less bitcoin entering the system = higher price.  Eg; this last halving, supply was cut in half and the price doubled.
In time the fees will naturally outstrip the coinbase and when they do the supply restrictions will have affected the price such that the fees are adequate to cover costs. This is especially true if you process more transactions to collect more fees, no?
Or, we can limit transactions to only the rich, removing Bitcoin from the global ecosystem, and let a competitor come in that welcomes the rest of us peons.
@_date: 2016-05-08 22:40:58

I don't particularly care if my bitcoin transaction is anonymous any more than I care if my cash transactions are anonymous.  The problem arises when I am denied the ability to make the transaction not based on who I am, or even if I committed a crime to receive the funds, but because the recipient simply doesn't like something that has happened one or more transactions prior to my receipt of the funds.
The example I linked above shows that circle is closing accounts simply because people are selling coins they didn't buy at circle.  If circle couldn't track the source of the coins, problem solved.
I want fungibility.  I (personally) don't particularly care if my transaction is anonymous or not.  I think Bitcoins should work more like cash if they are to be an effective "digital cash".
@_date: 2015-11-15 07:35:19
Circle doesn't necessarily set their category code, I'm pretty sure their merchant bank does after asking all kinds of questions about how they operate.
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:43:50
Happened to me too.
Of course they won't tell you why, I just assumed it was my settlement with the SEC for running BTC-TC back in 2012/2013.  Maybe instead it was that most of my coins came from trading on BTC-e.  Used to be the only exchange I used.
Either way, Bitcoin has a serious fungibility issue when you can lose your account over them tracing your coins to a competitor.
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:24:28
Before being shut down in 2013 it was generating hundreds of BTC per month.  See statements here:
June 2013:   (over 280 BTC net)
July 2013 :  (over 550 BTC net)
August 2013:  (roughly 700 BTC net, leaving out shutdown-releated legal expenses)
The code could be used pretty much as-is to set up something like Havelock, or it could be altered to do any number of alternatives like a crowd-funding portal, etc.  It had many features that other sites didn't have at the time and still do not have.
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:29:42
Can't be that ethical.  Over a year ago they closed my account on the day my bitcoin purchase was supposed to be delivered and after taking money from my bank account a week prior.  During that week BTC rose in price $15.  They then held my money another week before it was back in my account.  During that week bitcoin rose in price another $15, costing me an over 13% gain.  They thus acted illegally against my financial interest as my broker/dealer, and never made up for it in any way, nor informed me even why they closed my account.  I've never been charged nor convicted of a crime.  There's no reason to screw customers like that.

Same thing everyone else does.  Traded bitcoin.
I've never been charged with a crime, never had a duii, etc.  
I think that it's because the SEC didn't like my exchange back in 2013 so I shut it down and closed up shop.  No fraud, nothing criminal, paid a civil penalty and I'm a reformed man.  (Read... I now know better than to start a website without paying millions to lawyers and regulators.)  Now if you google my name the news of the settlement is the top result.  Sucks.

I disagree. I ran an exchange back in 2012 - 2013, bootstrapped as a hobby using pocket change.  When we did the final shutdown late 2013 (due to regulatory attention in the US) we returned 100% of deposits.  Going without trade commissions for a day, or a week, or a month would not have caused the exchange to fail.  If the exchanges finances are that precarious, then it was a failure long before the withdrawals started.  We kept the website online and responded to most customer service requests for nearly a year after the shutdown.

There are no layer two solutions available yet.
And sacrificing decentralization seems to be a commonly held fallacy.  Some may turn off their nodes when they run out of storage, sure.  Seems more likely to me though that doing nothing is going to cause users to stop running nodes.  Who wants to run nodes at home just so the rich can transact?  Who in any 3rd world countries are going to want to run nodes when each transaction cost as much as buying a meal?
On the other hand, if you keep transactions accessible, there will be new users spinning up new nodes due to adoption, and probably some people that have been frustrated and quit Bitcoin this last year will come back too.

You really think the few cents per transaction is why the miners mine?  Like, if transaction fees drop a few cents, they'll turn off their equipment?
Or do you think that somehow we'll lose more than a couple percent of full nodes if the block size increases to 1.5MB or 2MB?
As a past miner and current operator of several full nodes, I don't think either is likely.  Instead we've shot ourselves in the foot and lost a full year of network growth while killing off several promising bitcoin businesses and limiting bitcoin accessibility to first world use, where $0.10 is throw-away money.
It's like if pokemon go decided to start charging $0.99 for the app, just as they began to grow exponentially.  Totally would have killed it.

Without error checking it could then end up assuming the current price on LTC is zero, and subsequently trigger a series of margin call entries into the order book.

I'm pretty sure at this point it's a matter of opinion.  Fortunately for them, the only opinion that matters is that of the regulators themselves, and they now have a pile of cash to work on convincing them.  I've read the California statutes regarding what qualifies a business as an MSB and what exclusions are available and I think they are taking a huge risk offering the services they do without having an MSB license in place first.  I am guessing that  they are operating under an exclusion for brokers and dealers, yet what broker or dealer are you aware of that can run their own exchange (which is a separate registration with the SEC or CFTC) and/or offer merchant services?

I don't remember seeing "maximally decentralized money" as the whitepaper title.  I signed on for the digital cash vision.  Limited blockspace causing fees to increase out of control flies directly in the face of that vision.
Has anyone proven that the network of full nodes will actually shrink more than 5-10%?  I know my laptop from 2008 would be fine with the proposed bigger blocks, and when it's not anymore (sometime in 2018?) I'll just use my laptop from 2012 instead...
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:28:29
Thanks for reinforcing my point.  If my laptop's "no good" to the network then what robust node is going to have issues with bigger blocks?

They specifically state in client correspondence that they are an MSB.   (See here:   You can look up the list of licensed MSB's in the State of California here:

You can't cater to the lowest common denominator, you just can't.  Are you going to start expecting to run the whole bitcoin network over 9600 baud HAM radio links?  No, that wouldn't be reasonable - just like it isn't going to be reasonable to hamstring transaction capacity to allow modem and satellite internet users to run nodes.
Datacenters are a dime a dozen, all over the world, plenty decentralized, and perfectly suited to hosting nodes.  Think about the benefits in reliability with better node uptimes and better node connectivity.  Most facilities have multiple links coming in from multiple providers, and do route optimization to cross-connect by least amount of latency.
Centralized points of failure don't go away just by having people run nodes at home.  Quite the opposite, probably 4-5 providers run 90% of the broadband in the US.  What happens when Comcast decides they don't like bitcoin?  In that regard, datacenters are actually MORE decentralized.  Facilities are owned by a wider spectrum of companies, and are more hands-off with what you do with your servers than a home broadband provider is.
It's no mistake that Satoshi himself suggested that Bitcoin would eventually end up in datacenters.

No it's not.  They should have had code in place spring 2015 that would activate at a certain block height in spring 2016.  Everyone knew back then that transaction growth was going to hit the cap in early 2016 and you would have had a full year for everyone to upgrade their node.  This upgrade could not have been simpler.

I think their bank is forcing them to do the crazy KYC.  They need to register and establish their own bank so they don't have to keep forcing users out.

Good argument, but ask these guys how the missed opportunities worked out:
- Blockbuster
- Hollywood Video
- Borders
- KBToys
- RIM
- Packard Bell
- Prodigy
Sure, you want to be a bit risk adverse, but this is not a minor piece of tech.  It's a disruptive market changer.

Thanks for the PSA.  Gyft used to be my go-to for bitcoin gift card purchases, but I had to change over to eGifter when they discontinued the points program.  Only real issue I've had with eGifter is they use coinbase checkout, which frequently doesn't seem to see transactions on the blockchain before the 15 minute timeout.  (Whereas, I've never had an issue with Bitpay.)

Customer service has to be one of the biggest challenges there is for an exchange.  Unlike most banking customer service scenarios where mistakes can be un-done and illicit transactions can be reversed, in crypto an unscrupulous employee can do a huge amount of damage and there is usually no way to undo it.
Even things that seem simple like approving a withdrawal or resetting 2FA can easily be attack vectors and when an employee screws them up they can cost the company huge sums of money.

I setup Bitcoin acceptance on my website hosting company over a year ago, long before I really even understood Bitcoin.  The big draw was the reduction in processing fees.  Going from 3% and up per payment to 1% (or less) per payment is hard to resist.  Zero chargebacks are nice too.  The bitpay setup works such that there's no currency rate exposure if you don't want it.
I get that many users pay just as large a percentage to get their coins in the first place, but that isn't always the case, eg, for miners and others that run other bitcoin services.
Big issues I see:
- Getting Apple to allow full-featured Bitcoin apps.  Maybe if these guys started asking for it Apple would listen?  Imagine the pressure if these guys wanted to take Bitcoin mainstream and Apple was the one standing in the way.
- Getting the US back in the cutting-edge technology game.  If these guys asked for it, I bet Congress would listen and maybe loosen up some of the financial services regulations that have hamstrung US Bitcoin innovation.
The biggest win for these guys though is probably going to be the jump they'll get on their competitors if they get into it early.  Just like with computers, then email, then the internet, the early adopters are able to realize a competitive advantage.

I think in the US you pretty much have to keep the price in USD.  You can display the current bitpay conversion rate somewhere prominent so it's transparent and let them do the math if they want to prior to checkout.
If I were retail I'd start small by allowing reloads on pre-paid retail cards via bitcoin on the card portals.  The retail cards already have the benefit of promoting brand loyalty and this would take no changes at the point of sale to adopt.
Next step, retrofit the on-site card reload kiosk (and the customer service desks) to accept BTC.
After that, add BTC to the automated checkout machines.  The people that use those are already the more tech-friendly bunch.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:52:43
I definitely agree there.  Retail can (and probably should) wait until the point of sale guys catch up and "bitcoin support" comes for free with the next hardware/software upgrade.
Per my other post, there are cheaper and more compelling ways to take advantage of Bitcoin in the meantime, which would keep the Tech friendly younger generations coming back.

The consumer liability limit (chargeback system) and the rewards cards are both at the cost of the merchant, not the bank, not Visa.  
Internet merchants have little choice but to accept the cards, but because of how chargebacks work, all of the poor security choices Visa has made don't impact Visa at all.  It just gets added to a merchant's cost of doing business.
Worse, Visa and similar merchant contracts often state that a retail merchant is not allowed to ask for ID. (HuhWhat?)
Without credit cards as they are today, everything you buy online would be a couple percent cheaper.

The conversion to USD happens at the time of transaction in their system.  So if you invoice $10k, and your account is setup to deposit 100%* of all transactions as USD to your bank account, then you get $10k USD in your account the next day.  I convinced my lawyer to accept BTC.  I explained how it worked, he checked it out, and it was a no-brainer.  I get all my invoices via Bitpay now.
(*) Cool thing about their system is you set what percentage you want deposited next day and what percent you want to keep as BTC.  So for the risk adverse you set it to 100% USD.  For those that want to keep their proceeds in the BTC ecosystem, they can collect it as 100% BTC.
