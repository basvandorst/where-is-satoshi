Thanks for the comment!
Regarding those three attributes, gold can't be copy-pasted either and there are ways to distinguish real gold from fake gold. And to my understanding, bitcoins can be stolen.
Also, what makes it a better asset than all other coins? Apart from early adoption (which surely is a significant factor)? What is the value within Bitcoin specifically?

I appreciate your comments but can't agree with some of the opinions (although I may very well be wrong!):
How will you be able to convert your bitcoins (any significant amount) into fiat currency without getting caught? They may not be able to access your wallet, but they will throw you in jail if you refuse to pay taxes.
I doubt the majority of people will want to move to other countries either, and which country allows you to avoid paying taxes? Maybe some, but do you want to live there just because of bitcoins? And even if you do, most probably don't?

Thanks so much for replying, interesting points. 
One more thing: what is your valuation for one bitcoin? How do you value it? Is its true value higher than its current price?

One more question: can the early adopters of Bitcoin ever convert their bitcoins into fiat currency, considering those sales would probably have a huge impact on the price? Or can Bitcoin handle something like that?

I don't think it's production cost since if people never wanted to buy bitcoins, the production cost would make no difference. Nobody's going to say "I'll buy that because it cost $x to make!"
Why will the price double every four years? I don't follow the math (but I'm not that good at math). 
If you believe in the true value ("to the moon!"), are you fully invested? The current price is at a ridiculous discount compared to the true value. Or do you see risks?

Interesting, thanks for this piece of info.

Thanks for the comment! How does Bitcoin achieve this though?

Agreed, all of the people that I know have invested with this mindset. Not sure if there will be a "correction," or whether the current price is inflated, but that's definitely a common reason to invest in Bitcoin.

That reminds of a well-known quote: "Price is what you pay, value is what you get."

Thanks for being more specific.
And if that's the case, do you expect the government to fight back before this happens, or do you think they'll be too late / unable to stop it from happening? 
By the way, why will it be harder to tax bitcoin? Do you think companies that sell items and services and pay salaries will start doing so illegally, without reporting it?
Sorry if all these questions are annoying, I'm just really trying to understand how all of this works and what the potential is.
