Hello Amoci,
Sorry you had a bad experience, let me try to clear some things up for you


I find it rather hiliarious that the scammers try to impersonate our CEO and Founder, who apperantly has nothing better to do but to scam his own users. The most important rule on our Telegram group is: Trust staff will never message you directly. We will always ask you to write in the group chat or to initiate a chat with us first. You can learn more about these scamms and how to protect yourself [here](


The Multicoin Wallet created within Trust uses the same BIP39 standard like almost any other [HD]( Wallet out on the market. Mycelium uses the exact same standard therefore should display your Bitcoin correctly.
If you have further questions or need help with anything just hit me up on Telegram (
