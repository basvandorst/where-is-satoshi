Sorry officer. I didn’t know you were the official representative of HODLers. 
 I guess you don’t understand my actual questioning or reason behind my post. That’s okay son, hope you have a good day.
Now stop worrying so much about my behavior. That’s in violation of HODLer behavior. Now move on son.

Thats great to hear. Did you HODL because you believe in it or because you figured "Screw it".

It’ll never happen so why ask? Maybe ask a better question of what happens if more transactions come in than the network could support?

Not saying it’ll be easy,  but you need to change your mindset. I recommend working on your outlook daily.
We tend to fall into a negative mindset because everyone keeps feeding us hate and negativity; their way of staying above someone.
I’m working on blocking that shit out. Writing down all of the things I accomplished that were against the odds. Learning to find my younger behavior of being fearless and positive. I achieved so much with that mindset.
Like hose goofy books say about law of attraction etc, it’s actually real from a mental perspective.  No one wants to be around a weak and doubtful person.

There's certainly people who need some money given their positions in life but if you're speaking about non-profit orgs, good question. I started to invest in bitcoin for my moms retirement. I certainly believe in crypto, esp bitcoin, so for me it was the best investment for my mom.
In the meantime, I just work more to help save money and figure out how to invest it. Sadly, so many people grow up not knowing about money management. Had I known about money management, I could have been smarter about it. So is life.
Thanks for being a caring person. Hope you make a good investment that has an impact.

HODL. Listen, it's been up a significant this week. A small pullback is good. Here's how \_I\_ think about this.
a) It's good to have some pullback after a few significant spikes.
b) This is healthy long term. Having large spikes will result in a correction eventually. It's better to have those corrections over time vs. all at once.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:11:50
Both! ;) I was reading the Ascent of Money and it's very interesting. People who don't study the history of money, think that "money" never changes over time. There are so many interesting videos, articles, books, etc on the subject.
I wish my school taught me this sort of stuff. :(

I bought in at $5,000, again at $6,000, against at around $7,000 and against at around $8,000. Then $5,000 when it was $10,500.

I’m happy it stayed under 11,000. Now tomorrow I can see it going over 11,000 “safely” and let’s hope it doesn’t go above 11,200. 
I’m hoping for _baby_ steps. Granted going to 11,200 isn’t a baby step, but hey I can’t expect it not to move a little at a time.

That reminds me of the time I almost dated a girl I think would have been life changing for me.
Years later I looked back on it and felt sad. Then I looked her up and she was a total mess. 
You’re looking at a single bitcoin from what I understand. What seems like a lot of money to you know can be a drop in the bucket later in life. Stop thinking about what you don’t have and can’t have back.
I lost far more than that over the years. I get it, it sucks rotten ass. But what you need to value more is opportunity going forward. Not lost moments in the past.
P.s. the girl wasn’t a mess physically she just made a lot of bad chances. :)

There are people that are up $100,000's and will HODL because they believe in the long term value.
You really need to ask yourself "Do you believe in the value of bitcoin long term or not". It's a gamble... you can sell now and make $4,000 or HODL and make $8,000 or even more... or lose all of your profit.
I'm a HODLer.

theres no one reason for the price movement being so crazy. Ranging from whales wiggling their tails, people freaking out because they don’t know the value of bitcoin and what it has to offer etc
There’s far too many people that don’t understand bitcoin and why it’s massively important. 
No one can tell you if you’re investment was a bad idea. Here’s my opinion.
Bitcoin will most likely hit around 25k at which point we need to see what happens afterwards.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:12:03
No rules, but it’s not a question I think anyone will answer because it’s highly unlikely. Now the alternative question I proposed is one which the bitcoin developers are actually looking at solving. What they have been doing is increasing the block size to include more transactions, but that doesn’t scale. Lighting block and other solutions are also being proposed and explored to increase throughout and speed.

All of these ALT coins follow BTC. When BTC does well, everyone else does well. 
No one really knows what's a good/bad move. Listen I own bitcoin and have been doing well. That doesn't mean I'm smarter than those who don't. It just means I'm riding the wave. The only difference with me, I believe in the future of Bitcoin. The more research you do on the subject matter, the more you see the value of it.
Education is key!

You need to change your mindset.
I’m older than you and I need to worry about my future retirement and mother. I won’t go into any detail about those items, but let’s just say it’s a massive load on my chest.
I would be happy to trade places with you and your position. Why? You can spend 10 years working on your career and still only be 30. 
My advice to you and assuming I was you.
a) identify what you want your career to look like in 10 years and work towards that.
b) stop thinking about what others have, because it’s unproductive.
c) you are early in your life and it’s like clay, mold it into what you want and enjoy the journey.
d) visualize what you want and change your thinking so it becomes possible.
I went through a massive amount of stuff in my life. No one other than me cares about that. Odds of someone giving you a head start or a moment of release by way of money etc is very rare. 
I wish you the best and I know what you’re feeling. Help you work on your mindset like I am.

Not if he thinks Satoshi is black lol I don’t think satoshi is a single person. A good question now is has there been any people black suspected to work on the concept of bitcoin?
