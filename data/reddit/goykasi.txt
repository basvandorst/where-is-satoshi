You could have just sold the house for what you originally paid. That way you wouldnt have owed on any gains.
You operate in the system. You made a choice to make a profit.

I have a pile of sand over here. I'd like to suggest that buy it also. Assuming you don't try to spend it, it would be a great way for you to store value.

I take that to mean exactly what it says. They will reimburse the user if there are monthly fees. They can't know how many times you check your balance at an ATM ($.50) or how many times you withdraw cash ($3.50) or if lose your card and need it replaced ($5.50) until these things happen. They do know about the monthly fee; so I guess you could argue that they do know there will be some amount of fees, but, luckily, it is being reimbursed.
It sounds like the card issuer will be charging the card directly for these actions. That sounds exactly the same as normal banks (3rd party ATMS, international conversions, etc). Xapo cant pay these up front, because the associated fees will be different for everyone's usage.

MPesa is backed by the local currency. So it makes sense that it would be used. Its literally an alternate form of handing over cash. You are suggesting an unknown, secondary currency to be injected in to these local markets. That just doesnt seem practical.

I hope you are correct, but I hope its in relation to "entrepreneurs and venture capitalists" investing in founders that want to create useful services that can be built on top of bitcoin and the blockchain. To me, bitcoin is simply an investment in the experiment to use create digital currency system. That is why I work for a company that builds on top of the technology. I would like to see what type of applications and uses will come out of it.
My problem is mostly with existing users trying to convince the new users that bitcoin is going to make them rich some day via investing or saving or "hodling". To me this makes no sense and only exposes their true intentions -- that they themselves may become rich someday. Its very selfish and does nothing to help the bitcoin ecosystem grow.
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:58:58
Of course from a capitalist view point -- they are unlimited because a conglomerate can create/produce more cell phone minutes, but the lowly user must continue to buy and trade them -- they are not allowed to produce them themselves.
But lets get back to your original argument. M-Pesa is not actually exclusively backed by cell phone minutes. They are backed by tangible things (which BTC is not) -- whether it be local currency (in most case) or something else (potentially cell phone minutes -- created by a conglomerate). They hold value, and that value is easily recognizable by the local economy -- almost no technology required.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:33:09
Oh I see. Then what do you mean by supported? Also:


@_date: 2014-11-29 05:40:38
from the wiki page:




The idea for M-Pesa may have started with cell phone minutes, but that is not what it necessarily is today.
edit: Even if you were correct about only cell phone minutes. It is backed by something: cell phone minutes. Those are a tangible thing that can be used and hold value to the user.
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:42:51
So your plan is to horde coins. thus not allowing others to actually use them, in the hopes that someday you will be rich. That sounds great for the bitcoin economy.

Assuming you're from the US, Get a google voice number. You will be able to receive SMS from it, and also you get the added benefit of being able to call people in the US from abroad for free. I recently moved to Japan, and that's what I do. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:46:17
That is how some many people on the subreddit view bitcoin, and its awful and a very selfish viewpoint. Bitcoin is a thing for them to get rich on. You entrance into this subreddit gets them one step closer -- you might buy in.
If bitcoin is going to be any sort of success it has to be used/consumed. Whats the point of "investing" in it if its worthless and cant be used anywhere.
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:12:37
I'll go first! I'm a software engineer that recently moved to Tokyo to join a startup that provides financial services to online merchants (just Japan for now). At first, I worked for them part time while I was traveling around Asia, and then I decided to make Japan my home base for a little while. I had a good gig with them; so, I decided to make it a full time job. We are doing some neat things with Bitcoin, and it's been very interesting learning about and working with the technology. I mostly got into this because I think merchant services are a good first step -- maybe not the best, but it helps to provide an easy to use online platform for the users to purchase goods and services.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:30:11


Who are these people? Third world "these people"? Because those people do not have money laying around to put into bitcoin. They would never trust a system like this. The OP has even admitted that this method isnt even secure. That makes me (someone that can afford bitcoin) not to want to use it.
Who said anything remittance? It you would like to send them some bitcoin, be my guest, but I will assume you dont know them and they dont know you. Ill be even more surprised that that bitcoin is usable where ever it ends up. The people this service is designed for (cheap phones without data) would not be interested. They're more interested in living day to day, working hard (assuming they have work) and making ends meet. I would be surprised if they care about WU or bitcoin. Be real for a second.
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:25:53
You keep parroting the phrases "easier" and "release an official app". I think you don't understand. It's not "easy" to just release an app. Resources have to be allocated, people hired, designs made, development scheduled, qa processes followed, etc. That's not necessarily an easy process.
I would think it's easier to open up an api, have developer agreement -- maybe including branding -- and be in control of issuing and denying api access.
If this developer were to go rogue and start stealing funds, news would be spread here and everywhere, his api access would be cut off, legal teams would be after him, he would be shamed, etc. Based on him being higher profile (mobile dev at airbnb?), it's seems very unlikely that that will happen.
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:22:05
No. They want an exception because they are already regulated as money transmitters, and they are asking for that to apply for anybody in their same situation. Nothing wrong with that. If they were to get that exception, they could immediately open a real remittance system -- all around the world. Sounds like win to me to suddenly have bitcoin accessible from 500k locations and 100k ATMS in tons of countries.
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:06:34
Of course they are, and they are also asking for clarification so they can make a decision on whether or not to be able to accept virtual currencies in lieu of fiat currency. They even specifically reference how this applies to ATMs or kiosks.
This tells me that are weighing the possibility of using/accepting VC (bitcoin?) for providing remittance and transfer services. They are simply asking for an exception since they already have to comply with money transfer regulations. Nothing about that seems bad to me. If that is their intention, that could be very good for bitcoin. Imagine that all of sudden remittance is easily accessible to anyone with a WU office (500k in 200 countries), kiosk, or ATM (100k) nearby. Isnt that exactly what bitcoiners have been begging for?

So now I can I spend oil anywhere and everywhere bitcoin is currently accepted? Well hot damn.


Oh... well hopefully so. That would be much easier than carrying around 2-liter bottles of crude oil. 
I can't wait till I can buy FC (fluffy clouds) with my useless USD. It seems like the next logical step.

Awesome. How many of them can afford to use bitcoin? Isn't the motto, "Don't invest more than you can lose"?
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:03:44
Well that's not true at all. Cell phone minutes can be used and consumed. Once that occurs they are destroyed and have to be purchased again. The only major similarity they have to BTC is that can be trade for goods. Also, there is absolutely a limited supply. They are only unlimited to the company creating them, but they are being paid a currency for them.

I personally like bitcoin, but currently it is only for the banked, well off and tech-savy.

Just curious, what percentage of mobile users in your supported markets and soon to be supported markets have only non-data plans? What kind of research supports this? Honestly, I assumed the supported country list would be much longer. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 15:45:10
Why would they do that? They're already setup internationally. How would bitcoin help them at all? Currently, bitcoin remittance is a pain in the ass. Anybody that tries to say otherwise is a fool. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:09:31
Good luck with that. The people in that line are probably not receiving money. They are most likely sending it back to India. So you will also need to set up reliable, cheap internet services all over India so that the rural areas can actually 1) receive the btc 2) have a offhand chance to convert it to Rupees. Also, recipients will need a computer or smart phone -- most don't already have that. You might also need to supply electricity. Id be willing to bet you aren't in a position to do any of that. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:02:43
Very nice! Do you have an (official) API? We currently use Kraken for conversion rates since we use them to convert BTC to USD/Yen, but it would be nice to have a fallback or a way to get an average rate from multiple sources.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:23:28
I feel like sometimes Im one of the few that understand this problem. Its nice to see that others understand that bitcoin is not for the poor and "unbanked". Currently, its for the "banked" and well off. People in the third world would laugh at me if I tried to convince them to convert their (scarce) funds into bitcoin. It wouldnt make any sense.
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:57:54


Well I just happen to have found an edge case. Im happy to hear that this is beneficial to her situation.


But she will continue to until


they actual decide to do that. How difficult do you think it would be to convince her customers and suppliers to accept a relatively unknown system of currency? That is volatile? And requires a good bit of infrastructure to be more useful? Potentially insecure (as the OP admits)? Also, you will need to let them know that they may have to pay international SMS charges until Coinapult sets up services in their country, but thats an easier one to fix. This is very much a chicken or egg situation.


Of course, I realize that. In fact, I work for a company that develops bitcoin merchant services. I make a living because of bitcoin, but I dont kid myself about the fact that it is too new for most of the scenarios you try to describe. Services like this are a nice experiment, but until BTC is more accepted, trusted and stable, people scraping by, hedging against fickle crops can not count on BTC. They need stable local means to get by. They dont all (most?) have someone in another country that can funnel money back to them.
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:40:52
When all bitcoins have been mined, mining will have to continue to confirm transactions on the blockchain. The difference in that situation will be that, currently, the reward for mining a block will not be new bitcoins + transactions fee; the reward will just be the transaction fees. Everything else stays the same.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:08:31
The point of bitcoin is not to circumvent the law. That line of thinking is what makes many bitcoiners look foolish. Sure, you DON'T have to hand over the keys to your wallet, but DO expect them to make your life a living hell if you decide to withhold them. When you live in a particular jurisdiction, you play by their rules, or you suffer the penalty for breaking those rules.

And how many of those people have enough extra money to invest in an unstable currency system that is not widely used? Especially when their best (and affordable) mobile options are low budget phones and SMS? 
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:20:23
And those people in India do not have the extra money to convert to BTC. They may have barely enough to top up their prepaid phone, but definitely not enough to convert to currency that is not being used in their country.
I love bitcoin (Im employed because of bitcoin), but this notion that the "unbanked" can just go out and use bitcoin is lunacy. The unbanked are scraping by; they cant afford to be putting their hard earned money (usually not much at all -- some Indians only make the equivalent of $10USD a week or less) into a new currency system that isnt widely used or trusted.

Not doing it probably? By going around the system you have no guarantees against fraud, bad experiences, etc. This just seems like a bad idea all around.

This is absolutely the case. Based on what I know of mtgox (hopefully I am completely offbase), transactions occur within the mtgox system. These trades are not actually happening in the bitcoin block chain. Users of mtgox are not in control of their currency (bitcoins, usd, etc). They are at the mercy of mtgox, and whatever the owners decide to do is what will happen.
As an aside, if these transactions were occurring on the block chain, this would be a massive cluster fuck, and anybody that had a compromised account would without a doubt be out of luck. There are already a couple of users on the bitcoin forum reporting they all of their bitcoins were transferred from their mybitcoin account, because they used the same password as mtgox.
edit: oops I misread your post, but I think I am still a bit relative. This incident just shows how poor mtgox's procedures were.
@_date: 2011-06-21 07:26:29
I dont know that he actually said that, but he certainly did make some unnecessary accusations about how Kevin was using the site without providing substantial proof.
The thing that gets me is how so many forum users are so quick to side with mtgox without definitive proof. This is not the first time mtgox has been involved with unexplained trading/resolutions. Luckily, there are some users trying point out how irrelevant the login logs are, but its mostly just a witchhunt.
@_date: 2015-03-13 11:23:32
How do propose that you could actually stop anybody from continuing to do this? Bitcoin has never been an anonymous service (whoever originally claimed that did Bitcoin a huge disservice). Satoshi certainly never claimed that you could remain entirely private. All of the data associated with Bitcoin is public at its core. Someone writing a piece of code to vacuum up all of the transactions (and the associated data) is not difficult at all -- and spinning up VMs all around the world is also not difficult -- good luck with maintaining a blacklist. Tor is not some magic solution here. We have already seen recently that Tor users can be exposed just as easily.
