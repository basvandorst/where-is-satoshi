'Bitcoin Wallet' by 'Bitcoin Wallet Developers'
My Public Key is no longer visible in the wallet, which would make sense as my wallet contains two addresses now? I only have a QR code available...  
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:38:36
$450 now...
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:24:56
You seem very chilled out about loosing control of $1000...

I'll take my 10 bitcoins please...
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:15:18

Its a small 7 Inch tablet, therefore I put it in my pocket from time to time... Can I still spend this bitcoin from my wallet and more importantly  transfer it to anther wallet? Thanks.

In modern parlance, the term gentleman (from Latin gentilis, belonging to a race or gens, and man, the Italian gentil uomo or gentiluomo, the French gentilhomme and the Portuguese homem gentil) refers to any man of good, courteous conduct.

I still hold a bitcoin majority. Why are you trying to self-rationalise your purchase? could drop to to $700 or $1 tomorrow, no one knows... Really sick of people saying 'bitcoin is cheap right now!' This attitude is a great way to become bankrupt. Yes I am triggered! 
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:06:28
Maybe they could lower their fees then to reward their customers loyalty...

I think coinbase are providing an ok service. I just want to withdraw gbp when im paid gbp...

Someone is down voting this post! What the actual fuck!
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:53:01
Join the club... Ive been waiting 4 hours. Coinbase is not releasing the funds. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:35:13
Do you have an exact time for your transaction? Ive been looking at the recent blocks in an explorer but nothing seems abnormal, but then again im no expert. Do you have zero confirmations as well ?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:09:57
I think the fee might have possibly been too low. however, in the app I believe coinbase sets the fee? Am I right in thinking the transaction should reverse back to me eventually? its a lot of money so im very worried... 
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:05:30
I have the exact issue at round the same time. transaction stuck pending... Anyone got an idea of what is going on?
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:16:37
My transaction cleared after 4.5 hours, bitcoins the future... Haha
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:54:16
Coinbase! For fuuuuuck sakes! Please upvote this post guys so it gets noticed. Cheers
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:32:49
I pity you troll.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:20:51
Its up to them to release the funds
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:14:57
Same here bud. 0 confirmations. you send from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:59:09

@_date: 2017-03-16 02:44:03
But good news, they're going to start charging blockchain fees! Unbelievable...

@_date: 2017-03-16 01:02:08
Thats not right, Ive spoken to others with the same issue. my transaction has been pending over 2 hours with zero transactions on the blockchain.  
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:50:47
Thanks for the reply.  Love Denmark BTW,  amazing country!  ☺

90% of mining is in china. The price would most likely increase due to the disruption in the world economy. However, there is more chance of bitcoin going to 1 million than what youre describing. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:56:49
Up to you, benefits to both. Coinbase is insured so there's that...

I'd say 6,000,000 are already lost or unusable. A total of 15 million is a conservative estimate.

I bought back into bitcoin, waited a few days then sold on local bitcoin's. I actually made money! Until coinbase resolves this issue im sticking with localbitcoins.com. I've paid a lot of money in fees over the years using this service and have definitely learnt the hard way.. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:52:24
PM'd you mate. thanks for responding.

@_date: 2015-03-08 23:59:31
They wont ever need to understand... Does the average person know how gold is mined? They're likely to say "its mined out of the ground", which is the same minimum understanding that is required for bitcoin. Whats with people  assuming what future society require to adopt a new technology anyway? There are so many factors and variables to consider that anything could happen, right?   
@_date: 2015-03-02 02:44:21
This technology is very relevant to bitcoin...
