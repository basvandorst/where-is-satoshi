I think the bigger challenge is the somewhat volatile exchange rate. I might have enough BTC to mail my UPS package today but not enough if I wait a few days.
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:12:37


Agreed 100%. The problem is there will never be a (legal) economy that uses BTC exclusively as long as governments still demands taxes in fiat.


I'm not saying that business (with obvious exceptions like Coinbase or hedge funds) will never keep (significant) amounts of money in BTC. I'm saying that they have almost no incentive to do so until BTC becomes legal tender so that they can pay their debts (i.e. taxes) with it.

Shouldn't it be possible to just analyze the blockchain and automatically compute gains/losses for each wallet? It might actually be one of the easier parts of a tax return that reports capital gains.

True. But the UK parliament has granted the Commonwealth countries independence as part of their constitutions. Canada's constitution, for example, originates from the British North America Act but it wasn't until the early 80's when the constitution was amended that Canada became independent. This is something that has not (yet) happened with the Cayman Islands.

It's likely the mom and pop will need to convert to fiat currency anyway (just like TD currently does). After including the currency risk, spread, and fees charged by services like Coinbase it's probably that you aren't saving them much money.

Why is it impossible? Bitcoin is literally a public ledger of every transaction so, knowing what wallets you control, you should be able to compute exactly how much BTC you have at any given point in time. All transactions into your wallet(s) are used to adjust your cost basis. All transactions out of your wallet(s) are computed as gains or losses based on the exchange rate at the time. I actually don't see how this could get any easier.


Isn't that precisely what the blockchain is?


What's wrong with looking it up later? Knowing the exact time of the transaction (which the blockchain provides) you can retrieve the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

Is this an effect of the "possession is ownership" property of BTC?
In modern banking, ownership is represented abstractly as a number in your account. If someone can prove that you don't own the money represented by that number, the number can be changed. It makes no sense to hack a bank account and transfer a significant amount of money, since the transfer can be reversed.
On the other hand, with BTC (and gold, to the degree that it can be secured/hidden), even if can be proven without a doubt that these people intentionally and maliciously stole the BTC, nothing can be done to get the BTC back without their cooperation. Basically, the fact that they "possess" the BTC effectively means they are the owners of the BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:49:35
The exchange rate comes from exchanges (just like any other foreign currency). In forex, the IRS just requires that you are consistent about where you get the exchange rate from and don't try to pick and choose exchanges for favorable quotes.

In general, I would expect a company to accept the currency of the country they operate in. Canadians shopping in the US don't expect stores to accept CAD (they might, especially near the border, but it isn't expected). But for whatever reason, the people in the article seem to be having trouble converting significant amounts of their BTC to an accepted currency. This would worry me if a significant portion of my nominal wealth was in BTC.


I think this is where we disagree (at least for the current state of BTC). I should be able to use a currency as a benchmark to value goods and services. Very few (nobody?) is doing that right now. If you look at Overstock.com or other companies that claim to "accept" BTC, you'll notice that their prices are all listed in fiat and what they are actually doing is allowing you to conveniently convert your BTC to fiat to use in the purchase. This is equivalent to PayPal, with the exception that the "PayPal bux" exchange rate with the original fiat currency is kept at exactly one.

This is basically impossible (for now). Businesses are required to pay taxes to the government which currently does not accept BTC. Their employees, suppliers, and partners would probably also not want to be paid in BTC for the same reason.


This is almost certainly the short/medium term fate of BTC (who knows what will happen 100 years from now?). This does mean that the exchange rate between BTC and other currencies is meaningless, since it could crash down to 0.01USD and still be useful as a PayPal alternative.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:53:28


I hope you're joking and don't actually believe this. The IRS regularly audits businesses to make sure their books are in order. This is probably especially true of TigerDirect since their parent company is a [publicly traded company]( and therefore subject to [SOX](
And before you say that Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, customers probably give their info to TigerDirect so they can actually get their stuff. This means TigerDirect now has a big database mapping Bitcoin address to name/mailing address.

Why would you want to? If you don't control it, then if you transferred BTC to it it would be considered a "sell" and taxed at "fair market value". If you do control it, you should be able to prove it and you won't get taxed.

True, but if any transactions are made in the real world (buying goods, transfer from bank account) that does fill in some holes in the graph. With enough hints, it's possible to do a pretty complete analysis of the network unless steps are taken to specifically obfuscate. Which leads to...


 
In which case the onus will be on the one being audited to provide the records to prove the assumptions are wrong. This is why they tell you to keep your records for 7 (?) years.

I understand the desire to spread the good word and all, but does anybody else feel that it is irresponsible to push crypto currency on people that don't have a full understanding of how it works and the personal responsibility required to keep it safe? People are used to the safety net the banking system provides: if Bank of America goes Lehman deposits are FDIC insured, if Coinbase goes Mt. Gox there's no real protection.

Which is smart and exactly what I would expect someone managing people's money would do.
I wonder how many people are heavily invested in BTC without understanding the underlying crypto and its implementation. One flaw in the crypto, its implementation, or an advancement in technology that renders the crypto obsolete, and the entire BTC economy collapses. Unlike other fiat currencies, BTC doesn't have armies to back it up and relies solely on technical merit (which I guess is also its main selling point).

On the menu did it say 1 burger = 0.12 BTC, or $10? I think BTC has a good chance of competing with Visa or Mastercard as a payment service, but until transactions are commonly denominated in BTC you are still effectively using fiat currency just like you are now with your credit card.

Would you expect them to accept pesos or yuan? What about gold or maple syrup? The reason they don't accept BTC or probably any of the above examples is that at the end of day they *need* to convert to their local fiat currency, if only to pay taxes.

I think Bitcoin as a currency must be validated by way of being able to buy things, which includes buying other currencies.
I'm pretty neutral on BTC as a whole and personally I see it more as a competitor to PayPal or Visa rather than USD or Euro replacement. Just thought it was interesting that this article seems to try to promote BTC as mainstream money but it kind of does the opposite.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:22:33


I think it depends on the audience. There's seems to be some people with a significant proportion of their assets in BTC and they probably are concerned about the spot price (or at least the trend).
My question then is whether or not you think there is a positive correlation between adoption and spot price. If the main purpose of BTC is to serve as a means of transaction, it can do that at any price and there is no reason why it should go up (other than buying pressure from speculators).

I believe it depends on the circumstance of the payment. Merchants are of course allowed to refuse service for any number of reasons but legal tender must be accepted for all debts. That means that a restaurant can't legally claim you owe them money for the meal you just ate but not accept a (legitimate) hundred dollar bill. Note that credit/debit cards are not legal tender.
@_date: 2014-02-19 08:36:29


They do if they want to claim a debt. Otherwise it's considered settled.

That can't really happen until the government accepts taxes paid in BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:36:59


I don't think that's strictly true. Legal tender is only required to be accepted for settling debts. In principle merchants can simply refuse service (which is their right) unless payment is provided upfront, which they can set their own policy on. This is how convenience stores can refuse to accept bills larger than $20; they simply just refuse to sell you anything.

The post is basically talking about [dollar cost averaging]( which is used to lower the average cost basis of ones holdings. Note that one should only ever do this if they have a rational belief that this is a temporary drop, otherwise it's just falling prey to the [Gambler's fallacy](
Normally this is done with a diversified portfolio of assets with intrinsic value (like productive companies or real estate, ...) and not speculative instruments (like Bitcoin, gold or tulip bulbs). In the case of Bitcoin, there's no particular intrinsic reason why it should go back up, since it's perfectly able to serve its function as a means of transaction at any price.
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:12:55
Won't governments need to start accepting taxes in BTC before that happens? Otherwise I'll always have to convert BTC to whatever they consider to be legal tender, which exposes my savings to huge currency risks.
@_date: 2014-03-22 06:26:31
True. But I think the same issues apply, with taxes ultimately being the cause. Employees need to pay their taxes in fiat. Their landlords needs to pay taxes in fiat. In most situations, most people would prefer to be paid in the same currency as their debts, otherwise they are effectively in a leveraged position. So the landlords demands rent in fiat, causing the employees to ask to be paid in fiat or risk not being able to pay the rent.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:29:32


Care to expand on that? BTC works perfectly well as a way to pay for stuff whether 1 BTC is worth $1 or $1000. Merchants that accept BTC like Overstock do not care at all about spot price of BTC (Overstock uses Coinbase to process the BTC and convert to USD).

I'm not sure how you are making the distinction. Sovereignty means that they make their own rules independently.

This is different from say, Canada, whose head of state is the [Queen of Canada]( which is a distinct legal entity with no legal ties to the UK.

I think when people talk about whether or not BTC succeeds (and by people I mean OP and the economists he references) they are talking about the viability of BTC as currency. If you are thinking about BTC only as a Paypal or credit card substitute, then I agree with you. Although I think if you account for the bid-ask spread on BTC and the fees taken by the exchanges, I'm not sure if it really works out to be much cheaper than traditional payment systems.

As long as your government denominates tax liabilities in fiat, there will always be a need to convert to fiat. As long as there is a need to convert to fiat, BTC is not a currency.
To be used as a currency, I need to be able to use it as a benchmark for goods and services. So when I'm buying a chair on Overstock.com, I need to be able say that chair is worth 0.5 BTC. This is currently not the case because I (and Overstock) owe USD to the US tax man and at some point will need to convert BTC to USD. Therefore I will always need to be conscious of the USD-BTC exchange rate and whenever I spend BTC I'm actually denominating the transaction in USD. This is no different from say using Paypal, where I spend "Paypal Bux" but really I'm still just exchanging plain old USD. It's also the same reason why gold is not a currency.
I suppose that even this too can be answered by "for now", but I'm not optimistic that the US (or Canadian, Chinese, German, etc...) governments start taxing in BTC within our life time.

I don't believe the argument holds for the Euro, since merchants do price things in Euro. If a major economy starts pricing things in BTC, including people's salaries, then yes we would have a huge problem if BTC crashed in value.
To my knowledge, there has been no significant movement to price things in BTC and all merchants that accept BTC are actually pricing the transaction in fiat, your example of amagimetals.com included. So again, amagimetals.com probably doesn't care if BTC drops to $0.01 since they price a gold eagle for $1000 they'll just charge 100,000 BTC. All of the cool benefits of BTC (low transaction cost, accessibility, security, and so on) are still there, independent of the value of each BTC.


Do they really? Or is it that they have value by fiat only? In particular, the European governments demand that their citizens pay taxes which are denominated in Euro.
I guess I should also add that I'm assuming that the value of BTC doesn't drop to the point where market capitalization is so low that liquidity becomes an issue. At that point merchants will start to care, because they won't be able to convert the BTC to their local currency efficiently. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:40:00
Until we can pay our taxes with BTC, it will remain as a Paypal competitor rather than a replacement for fiat currency.
Recent stories about major retailers "accepting" BTC(Overstock, Tigerdirect) are red herrings. If you look on overstock.com, you'll see that all the prices are denominated in USD. The reason is simple: Overstock isn't actually accepting BTC as a form of payment. They're just giving customers a simple interface for converting BTC to USD which is what they really accept. This is no different from what they do with Mastercard, except the customer has the extra fun of dealing with the volatility of BTC. This is not going to change any time soon because their tax liabilities to the government are denominated in USD.

From the perspective of the business, there is really little incentive to keep BTC. Almost all the money in a business goes somewhere: employee salaries, payments to suppliers, rent to landlords, profits to owners. All of whom also need to pay taxes to a government which doesn't accept BTC.
The only situation I can see where money can be kept as BTC is if the owners choose to take less profit and instead have the company invest in BTC. But this essentially means they are choosing to expand their business into a whole new industry (assuming they aren't already a hedge fund), which makes little business sense.

So you honestly would have no concern that if you wanted to buy a house (for example), you couldn't because all of your savings are in an illiquid asset (which seems to be the case with the people mentioned in the article)?


I don't think I did that, but if I did I'll chalk it up to poor writing on my part. What I did try to imply was that in all current mainstream cases, Bitcoin is being used like Paypal, which is orthogonal to their respective technical implementations. Merchants like TigerDirect or Overstock do not at any point in time ever have a net position in BTC (payments are converted immediately to USD) and all transactions are actually denominated in USD. From Overstock's perspective, it doesn't matter what the current price of BTC is, just like how the price of "Paypal bux" doesn't matter. Neither are currency.
This all changes once things are actually valued in BTC (e.g. a laptop on TigerDirect being listed as 1 BTC). But I don't even see Bitcoin enthusiasts doing this; all over this subreddit people only talk about how much USD (or CAD, or EUR) they sent in BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:17:25
Visa and Mastercard don't allow surcharges. The hit in sales they take from getting banned by Visa would probably far exceed any benefit of accepting BTC.

I don't think it would make a difference would it? In my country (US/Canada) we report our total income for the last year. Just because I wasn't payed in USD/CAD doesn't mean I don't report it. So if USD drops relative to BTC, I still have to pay the same amount of "value" in a greater amount of USD.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:15:39


Maybe you should have written that instead of waiting for me to do it :p?
I admit I added some hyperbole, but I think the spirit of my original statement still holds in that there is no particular intrinsic reason why BTC won't just stay where it is now or drop a little more. A minimum market capitalization is required, but I think BTC has already reached or exceeded that threshold. Paypal globally only transfers about $5k USD per second, so I think the current BTC market cap of $7 billion (according to Bitstamp) is more than enough to support at least that.
**The good news though is that BTC has probably reached a point that it is viable to use for most everyday transactions, as long as you aren't buying fleets of jumbo jets.**


It's unlikely that legitimate businesses will ever transact only in BTC (no conversion to fiat). At the end of the day they need to pay taxes to the local government in fiat so holding BTC introduces a huge amount of currency risk, with not a whole lot of benefit.

Are you sure about that? I know that in the case of Canada, until independence was granted in the 80's only the *British parliament* could change the constitution which is why they needed the amendment in the first place. Same thing with other territories like Hong Kong and Australia.


Australia did not gain full independence from UK until 1986. Prior to that it was the same situation where the UK parliament had certain legal influences on the Australian government. After that, the Governor General still has the power to dissolve government but this is on behalf of the Australian Crown, not the British Crown (two distinct legal entities).
