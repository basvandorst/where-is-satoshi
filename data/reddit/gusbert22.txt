Very good advice... this coming tax season I will provide my accountant with all my gains due to crypto, i want to do it right. Since I work as a touring Musician, I wonder if my accountant (who specializes in music) will even know how to navigate this world?!

Thank you all for this information! I will speak with an accountant. My mind is not wired to deal with taxes like this. Ha

Yeah I was trying to figure that out. I figured that I would not owe tax until I sold the BTC for USD. If I convert one coin to another without it ever being fiat, don’t I only pay tax on the BTC when I sell? At no point was it ever USD. Used exodus to make conversion.

Oh good to know! I got lots of work to do. I move coins around all the time!

Thanks for your thoughts. How do you envision having an election take part on blockchain would expose something a politician is trying to hide?
