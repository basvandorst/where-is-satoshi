This is true. Even bitcoin doesn't have the liquidity needed. Even 0,10% transaction cost for just moving money is HUGE. Even the bid-offer spread is way over this. And when a bank want's to move 100m$ somewhere, it would move the price a lot.

Living in Finland, works great. Free school (also university), free healthcare, social safety net. Higher income tax, but well worth the peace of mind.
Democratic socialism works as long as balance of payments is kept positive and no corruption is tolerated. Any country fails if they spend more than they earn but redistribution of income to a point is not evil per se. Actually I think it's more evil if 1% of the population takes all the income. Production is social in nature anyway.

That's the point. Democratic socialism is not soviet union. That's communism. During the cold war your government just wanted to speak about socialism and communism like they meant the same thing. Here when we say socialism we mean democratic socialism. 
Democratic socialism is basically capitalism with safety nets. It takes into account some issues of "big scale" free market capitalism (some right wingers in US like to call it globalism and left in US call it Wall Street). Either way, middle class is being wiped out as we speak and if income doesn't get redistributed outside of free trade (through taxes or whatever) to education and healthcare, some will get a lot but many will have very little. I'll rather have enough than more if we don't have to have homeless.
P.S. No-one here cares about who your president is. That's not personal to anyone. It's your president. I just know that we have democratic socialism and it works quite well. I've been to California and it was shocking to see how much homeless people you have. Also San Fransisco was ugly to see, but not as bad. All the documentaries and news I've seen are telling the same story. I have never seen anything like that anywhere in Europe and I've been to many places.

Absolutely not true. I bet you haven't seen what this subreddit looked like end 2017. Mainstream don't know anyhing yet. Bitcoin has been creeping behind their backs and they will shit their pants when they wake up.

I'm not from US so I'm not too concerned about who is the president and who is in the lead of fed. Loose monetary policy is just giving Bitcoin more strength, and that's the news. Don't care about Trump vs. Obama/Hillary whatever. We have our own problems here :)

So does it create those all from the same seed, so keeping the one seed safe would be enough as a backup, or does the wallet software keep inside many seeds so that one should keep backup of the wallet file itself?

Btw I want to remind you that Greece CDS looked pretty good 2009 even though fundamentals were complete rubbish. CDS and bond markets trade very tight right now. Greece is a bad comparabe since they are being bailed out already. If greece was a company, it would had defaulted many times already.

What do you think would be their incentive to push the price down so that people would buy the dip? I would understand if they had huge short positions but to get normies buy the dip...
Just trying to understand what you were after. Finance background here too: I've been trading derivatives for living and now 80% in cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:27:39
That is true. I understood that you thought there would be loose ends. In case of bitcoin, I think it's even more tied to the "real" asset due to extreme volatility. Not sure how big pile of money really wants to short bitcoin long term and leave it open.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:09:29
What? My feeling is the complete opposite. Keiser report is shilling bitcoin all the time. My feeling is that they are trying to weaken US dollar. If US dollar loses it's reserve  currency status, it's going to be really bad for US government and very convenient for Russia (and China).

RT is just one channel. RT is also doing a service. I think both are true at the same time. RT is not pro US nor anti US per se. It's pro Putin. It's in their interest to take down US government but they may also help US citizens at the same time. Flippening cannot happen without US government losing it's global dominance. US government losing it's global dominance cannot happen without Putin being happy about it. Putin does not hate US citizens. He does hate your government.
I'm not US nor Russian citizen btw. Just observing global political scene with interest.

Oh, ok. I asked because in my opinion it's really hard to point out actual causal relations. Markets often over interpret the meaning of correlations between A and B. I agree that WS may have power to drive the price, but for me it looked like that the volume behind those futures wasn't big enough to incentivize anyone to manipulate bitcoin's price. Risk reward ratio just didn't seem to be there unless one is able to short big time somewhere else (or then volumes changed dramatically after first weeks).
I guess the real game will start H2 2018, when many market participants will have futures based products on bitcoin in place. When they start making phone calls and selling bitcoin products for HNWIs and institutions, money will start flowing. Not sure if the real volume is there yet when banks trade only from their own balance sheet.

Then you would have to regret later if you were wrong. If you got a bitcoin in the first place, you "never had the money".

I think people often misinterpret people working in finance sector when they are interviewed about cryptocurrencies. The thing is, they are constantly being judged by their peers and they are probably not nervous because of the cryptocurrencies as such but because of their peers. What I see is that she is afraid of potential coffee room discussions where she is being needled and asked about her real opinion. People in finance often try to shoot their competitors down. She don't want to answer to them, because she don't know. And not knowing is something that would make her peers to question her position and thus make her everyday life more difficult. It doesn't matter if it's cryptocurrencies or something else that's very new and controversial. Intelligent people often don't want to be in the spotlights because they understand how it may cost their reputation later.

I think the real question is: are these muslim countries in or out? Not the other way around. No one outside is going to care if it's considered halal or haram inside different muslim communities. Conservatives will just miss the train, doesn't matter if they are muslims, christians, buddhists or atheists. Clock is ticking.
