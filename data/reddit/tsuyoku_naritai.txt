The scary thing is how many people upvoted such tinfoil hattery.

New account.
Your post here says selling 80k DRK, but your post on says 8 Masternodes' worth, which is only 8k DRK.
Saying you need to sell as fast as possible for emergency, while also saying lots of FUD about the coin on &amp; that you're ready to dump on cryptsy, which are bound to drop the price.
This happens coincidentally right after DarkSend+ is made public.
When someone wants to buy, you say "Actually if you just watch cryptsy Im sure by the time IM done dumping you can get them for .0092".
Obvious attempt to cause selling into your bids is obvious. :)

Any source other than Roger Ver?
They accept bitcoin donations, but according to their website they don't appear to accept bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:06:10
Well, the *perfect* solution is Darkcoin. :-) But Bitcoin is awesome too, and will probably hit them first.

It's hilarious how every time the price drops all of is all "Even though it's up 9999% in 2 years it's down 50% recently so I bet they feel dumb! It only gained 100 times the money it just lost!" Loser: you!
@_date: 2014-09-04 20:28:30
Lol... no. While it has a great community &amp; it's done crypto a service by bringing in new users that wouldn't otherwise have joined, it's not a sane investment. The supply inflation is silly.
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:50:32
Twist: VoS made that sale... for the avalanche of new customers rushing to place $1 bids.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:54:14
Indeed. I'm surprised more people don't talk about this yet, it's something crypto badly needed.

[Here's]( his reddit post for more detail. It looks dubious (see the comments).
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:10:27
It had to grab attention because otherwise people were in danger of losing bitcoins. Even so it was only phrased as a possibility and, as it turns out, according to bitstamp themselves...


It's not hysteria if it's accurate.
Also, the post directly above was made later when there was much more information available about what was happening.

They have $37,000,000 in bitcoins in the address above, they can't be THAT insolvent!
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:12:31
This thread was first, and has been kept because it contains information about what happened at the very start before it was even clear anything was terribly wrong.

*That's* going to haunt them if they mess this up...
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:14:53


...but you're right, compromised might give the impression the coins have definitely been taken. I'll change the wording.
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:29:36
Is it the same issue? What happened?
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:18:56
Fair point, but it shows they're nowhere near to having run out of reserves or being *forced* to collapse. Unless they handled this particularly badly and caused a run on the exchange, but I hope they're smarter than that.

You're right, I was thinking of highlighting (the distinguish button, which makes the author's name green and adds an [M], showing they're speaking as an official mod). I'll correct the post.

That's because they're closed. You're looking at what the price was when they suspended trading.

It's [here]( Not sure why it was taken away as we can easily have both stickied. Thanks for spotting that, I've added a note to the top of the OP so noobs can find it.

It's [here]( thanks for your support. :)
The mods unstickied it when Bitstamp's promised relaunch deadline passed, but I'll keep updating it as long as I can see people are still interested.

Check out my history. This isn't a throwaway, I've been around a while and mod for one of the major crypto subs.

Bitfunder have spent a lot on lawyers looking at regulations etc. so are less likely to get caught unprepared by such things.
ASICMiner shares are also cheaper right now on BitFunder, and you can still get yesterday's dividend if you're quick.

Income is huge compared to expenses, growing strongly, and the new Hardware Franchising model means more opportunities to grow without directly mining too much of the network.

This thread has been moving at about that crazy pace for a while, not just after this post, and lots of those PM says are shills for the IPO have been attacking it in the thread.
So not saying it's not a scam, but this isn't evidence of it.
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:53:31
Can the attacker create a malicious version given a good version, or do they have to have created both?
If they have to have created both, then surely you can still trust MD5 as long as you trust the original software and MD5 key?
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:33:03
Indeed, but considering the quality of media coverage lately we're lucky they labelled the axis.

It's worse than that - 25% would be 95% inflation in a year. Think 1.25 cubed, not 25 x3.
And that's vs the dollar, so add what the dollar's inflated by... call it an even 100%.
