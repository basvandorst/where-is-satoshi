i thought they only made money on the transaction fee and not diminishing the value of your coin.........

read on on the issues, seems .standard however. No one can deposit/withdrawal.
So its just like they're sitting there. Then again, I am a newb.

Hi Nima,
Thanks for alerting us to this issue. I’m very sorry to hear you were scammed on twitter. The Fraudulent twitter account has been taken down. Unfortunately we’re not able to refund funds you sent to this address, bitcoin transactions are not reversible. I’m very sorry.
I’ll pass your feedback along to our team for consideration. Coinbase support will never ask you to send funds to a third party bitcoin address. Note our official twitter has a verified checkmark. Again, i’m very sorry.

interesting concept
@_date: 2016-02-19 05:47:27
They overlooked what I had stated regarding replying to client issues via twitter. 
I never asked to reverse the transaction, I am more concerned about the future.

Well played sir for not falling for the scam. And thank you for your good luck. Shows you that a scammer can come up with an arsenal of user related schemes when they know what you're inquiring about. I mean c'mon.

You're right, and there may be a glass half full attitude approach to the situation.  Valuable lesson learned. And ya, they should know better than to help users publicly. Cheers bud.
