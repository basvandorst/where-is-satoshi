dont tell him, it will increase alt diff... and ita bitcoin sub anyway
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:03:28
you want to mine bitcoin using a PC!?  you need to educate ur self for altcoin like vertcoin, darkcoin, litecoin or doge if you want to do mining, then exchange ur coin into bitcoin, because we dont mining bitcoin like that anymore.

yup the problem is, its been years since bitcoin is my side jobs, my hobby, since that i got more income from my side jobs, i love more my hobby, and i never in a single day not think about this cryptocurrency potential in the future, but i only spent my time on crypto less than my day job

yes u r right, bitcoin is not necessary to be replacement of fiat, it is replacement of current banking system
as for coffee problem, we can create physical coin or paper that worth bitcoin, just like cascasius coin, it can have pvt key inside, or that physical coin can be exchanged into digital coin.. not a big deal

so more supply of bitcoin == less price of btc right?
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:46:41
you dont have to include tx fee on transaction, its optional
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:52:29
nice, i will buying more darkcoin
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:49:16
bitcoin need to be hard forked to change its algo from sha256 into x11, and all asic miners will not usable after that
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:18:33
it also mean bitcoin mined into circulation is faster, because we can mine bitcoin by mining alt, while it increase bitcoin demands but doesnt put fiat (USD,CNY,...) into bitcoin circulation, so bitcoin market cap is drained
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:03:29
so they terrified because we as miner help them to write their transaction record and keep it valid for a life time, while they can do transactions with really really cheap almost no cost at all, and they said we are creating money out of thin air, while we are fiddling about electricity cost, pre order waiting time, and tuning on overclocking and its cooling system !... very very dumb smart

gold is just a metal, but we assign it worth too. mining is just a process of bitcoin issuance, transaction verification and store system, bitcoin does not get its value directly from mining

they use some optimization in hashing merkle root, so they dont "brute force" block hashing with random nonce, transaction count in base-2 number have some interesting property if their merkle root is hashed with double sha256

dollar value is on issuer promise, suppose u have very very legitimate company, and ur company publish a piece of paper of one bitcoin, and your company promise that they will pay whoever has this piece of paper a funds worth of one bitcoin
so by using that piece of paper people can do transaction without waiting block confirmation, turning up cellphone, scanning code...

you can buy btc at btce then sell it at mtgox, then your money stop there in usd, who want to hold usd today?, you can withdraw those usd to your bank account, but the cost is higher than the cost moving it from btce, the problem with mtgox is they only provide btc/usd market

@_date: 2014-04-06 17:31:42
its not multiple of 128, its 2^n number. its because nonce is only 32 bit number its too small to guess into target hash, so you need to change some bits in coinbase transaction script or merkle root hash, merkle root hash produced by hashing merkle root, where merkle root is from transactions tree which is merkle tree and its a binary tree, binary tree will be balanced when it has  2^n node (transaction). balanced merkle tree has some property on its merkle root hash (its my guess)
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:16:59
its not really a problem, it said its not official &amp; legal currency for national transaction, well ofcourse no country has bitcoin or crypto as their official currency
the only problem is they said its "virtual" not "digital"

make sure u are using marucoin-mod kernel for x13 and darkcoin-mod kernel for x11, you can use sgminer binary from nicehash.com/software then make sure u r using catalyst 14.6
use TC 8192, worksize 256, gpu-threads 2, lookup-gap 2, intensity 18, lower ur memory to 1000mhz, and core as high as u can get

so whats your suggestion for backup-backup plan, for me if bitcoin things ripped me off, i still can get back to my normal jobs as software developer, i've been programming since 10, i got my bachelor degree at mathematics (on crypto), so i think still got skill to continue my life if bitcoin doesnt work well, how do you think?

they just voluntary support the network, not just for profit

but market cap are about crypto vs fiat, bitcoin on alt market still considered to be crypto market, so total volume of crypto against fiat is not changed if no fiat getting into crypto market, so the price of all crypto should stay... if price of crypto in fiat stay, and we create more crypto (by launching new altcoin and mine them) that create inflation on crypto market then bitcoin price will follow to drop

if you see how merkle tree relate to number of transaction (notice merkle tree is a binary tree), and how the effect of double sha to its merkle root, you will see the relevancy
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:48:13
yes its is strong in term of cryptographics, but if you know how the hash targey should be ( first n-bit is zero) you can do sha256 in reverse to find solution. SAT solving will be more efficient as difficulty get higher up to the point when brute force and algorithmic guessing is equal in term of computing power, so its looks to be the time we will move back to cpu mining using SAT solver
edit : its not deterministic too anyway, its just a way of smart guessing of nonce value

@_date: 2014-04-06 16:40:17
it like some advanced SAT solver, where you trace some bits in reverse to look which bit you need to set to produce zero bit on its hash, this solver need reduction to make it optimized, some of it is power-2 of transactions count

its always going to the moon, no matter how the look of chart now
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:52:02
layout is just same with old bitcoinqt nothing new, here are my suggestion 
* you dont need receive button/tab, user can see his receiving address, on address tab (this is why its called address book), and give user to choose which is main receiving address and put it on header or any persistent area
* transaction list are reduntant on mainpage and transaction tab, you can simplify it into one tab or just put it on main tab, you can give user an option to view in as all address transaction or specific receive address transaction
* you need to integrate it with exchange rate, so user have idea how much is 0.0125 btc is ( we still living in fiat world )
* balance label should be bigger than unconfirmed balance, put emphasize on balance not unconfirmed, and also "unconfirmed" word is too technical and more agitating for most user, it could be mean you got problematic balance, user can read he got problem that wallet can't confirm it instead of "not yet confirmed", its better to use word like "incoming xxxx BTC" or something.. to give big picture to user that he will receive that amount into his balance in a minutes
* replace date string with, "yesterday", "today", "two hours ago" etc..
* what is date below user name, does it have any function or information? if not then delete it
* i am not sure putting user picture and name on header has any function, its better put QR Code main receiving address there
* its not clear which tab is active, you only put small color change on its text, light blue vs darker blue, you may want to put more emphasize on current active tab
* use fixed width font on currency number and address string, and align on decimal separator for easy read, and also its better to use different color on number after decimal separator or make the font size different
* send and receive icon somehow has ambiguity, its better to use arrow pointing outside of some box for sending, and arrow pointing to some box for receiving, left and right arrow is not clear
* you actually dont need signal bar on lower right corner, what user need is only does wallet connected to internet or not, user dont care how many peer you are connected (make it less technical)
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:11:03
cool story bro
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:24:21
* you got two search field, top right corner, and right side at the middle, this is useless and confusing
* blockchain is about blockchain, we never look on to bitcoin news at blockchain site, please remove that panel
* does latest transaction have any use, bitcoin transaction is fast its more than 10 per second, why we want to put that on the frontpage, no one will read it anyway
* total sent, size (kb), age, transactions column should be aligned on decimal separator, and right aligned
* its better to use fixed width font for currency number
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:48:21

yes its not reversible, but H(x) = y. if you know how y should be and u can play on x, you dont need to break the crypto, you just need to play with x and y, SAT is looking for bit combinatoon of x and y. 
there are infinite number of y, that make x correct, and also there infinite of x that make y has target property
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:14:51

1. it doesn't matter, if bitcoin network are compromised, users will move to another crypto network, and if the bitcoin network was compromised the price will go down to zero, so why would goverment invest large amount of money just to make people move from one crypto to another crypto without gaining anything
2. transaction fee will significantly more than current transaction count, as userbase of crypto increase
3. there are no plan, it fixed as it is and bitcoin are infinitely divisible so there are no problem
