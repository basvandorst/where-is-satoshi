is a good place to start investigating.  Ask questions, research answers.  Friendly sub, similar to this one just focused on cannabis investment.
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:38:09
If I was going to invest in anything right now I would invest in Cannabis.  Depending on your investments you can get in fairly cheap and make profits as markets continue to legalize.  In my mind Bitcoin investment should be focused on trying to make it a viable currency.  If you are investing as a means to gain value from profits in increases you aren't doing much more than gambling.  That means really long term investments.  Like 3+ years possibly with no guarantees on return.  The technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, absolutely has value.  The potential for BTC to be a viable currency is still being weighed.

Geez.  Looking to whacky conspiracy theorist groups to explain Bitcoin pricing does not make a good argument for the future of the coin. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:08:58
Totally agree.  Anyone claiming that there will be mass adoption and FIAT will be dead is a fool.  At best Bitcoin may become an alternative model for financial transactions.  It will not supplant fiat currencies.  In an economic downturn more people may park money in Bitcoin if they think it is a safe haven.  Similar to gold bug enthusiasts.

Bitcoin will never be a daily currency.  If it survives it may become an alternative currency used to make payments and purchases in some scenarios.   I am not anti-crypto.  I am a realist.   Super rich have too much invested in the control of fiats to ever let them not be the dominant currency source.   And the masses are easily controlled.  If you don’t believe me, look at Brexit and Trump.  People easily led against supporting their own interest for the sake of their racism and bigotry.
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:47:34
It's not known if this is true.  The thought is that when a financial collapse occurs people look to park money in alternatives beyond stocks and bonds.  Things like gold.  The thought is that people will invest into Bitcoin.  This is not proven yet as no one knows what people will do in the next financial crisis.

Great idea you have here for trying to develop the commercial viability of bitcoin.  Get an investor to manipulate the market.  That will make people trust it more.

You mean the consistent pump and dump is back on again.
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:30:29
That’s BS. you just want to benefit from the manipulation.  And this is why Bitcoin will never be anything beyond a volatile commodity play at best.  It is not destined to ever be a widely adopted global currency.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:24:48
But it’s about the tech and adoption.   /s

Yeah.  The post above this one says 20K by May!  I mean come on.

No.  You are the idiot.  Bitcoin is an implementation of blockchain.  The first popular implementation, but an implementation none the less.  One of the more likely implementations will be in contract management. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:23:03
Inflated no.  Price manipulation, yes.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:53:34
No kidding.  You made profit.  Tax is owed.  Same applies to stocks.  Not sure why you say it is a scam.  It funds the government.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:36:00
Isn’t this the guy that Bitcoiners hailed as a guru for the cause?  
@_date: 2019-10-07 23:55:43
Ohhhhhhh!  Now I see.  You are an idiot.
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:38:52
About the same time it became all about price when so many posters claim belief in the technology.   Blockchain is the technology, Bitcoin is an implementation.  I think that Bitcoin will be around a long time but it will not supplant fiat.   It will hang in for a while due to zealotous belief and hard core followers.   Institutional money is looking at real world implementations of blockchain that can actually fix real problems.  There are better solutions for dealing with finance other than trying to meet the wet dreams of anti-bank or anti-government types.  
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:38:51
Yes.  It is called taxes.  You gained 2K on your original investment.  You did not lose money.  Do you not understand economics and investment?
@_date: 2019-10-07 23:45:16
This has nothing to do with MY government VS any other.  You pay taxes in any capitalism based economy.  Did you not learn any civic or economy based lessons in school?  You are making no sense.  If you don't want to pay the capital gains, don't sell the Bitcoin.  You only pay when you trade for US Dollars or whatever other currency you choose.
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:42:32
Sounds like gambling sentiment 
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:26:21
Wow.  No regulation is a great idea.  Currency of the future right here.  [
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:21:03
crypto and stock are not the same.  Also, stock has not made any significant movement based on the impeachment.  It has had more volatility based on the Trade negotiations with China.
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:11:50
Dude.  It didn't cause a panic because the only ones left in the Bitcoin scheme are the whales and the lemmings.  The whales cause a massive drop and the lemmings go let me dump more money into this pit.  You can't compare BTC to the stock market.  Gold would be a rough equivalency.

@_date: 2019-12-19 15:09:41
I don't think Trump impeachment will have impact.  It isn't expected to have any consequence.  So it won't affect markets much.

By diversification I mean other investment and savings vehicles.  Stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.  I say that depending on what your goal is for investment.  For long term savings and retirement I work my 401K and then do stocks and things like Bitcoin as a mix of safe and risky investments.  I mentioned it only because it sounded like you are dropping all of your funds into Bitcoin.  No judgement, just advice.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:41:48
My only comment would be if you aren’t doing it, diversify your investments.  Regardless of your belief in the technology or future of bitcoin you should never put all your eggs in one basket. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:38:52
As opposed to supporting the folks who use Bitcoin for the drug trade.  This is a ludicrous response to someone wanting security in how they handle their finances.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:28:21
Why is regulation now a good thing for bitcoin?   Past arguments have said that the issue with fiat is central government regulations.   That a currency untethered from a government was a good thing.  What has changed?
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:32:36
Why?   Why does it have to moon?  Past performance is not an indicator of future activity.  Mooning means volatility which isn’t great for currency or investments.   Because, as happened, the opposite would hold true that it then has to crater.

Not sure how it could be illegal anyway.  It is an unregulated industry.  What do our legal scholars say on this?
