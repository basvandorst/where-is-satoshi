A public key is 2 coordinates in a curve. If you know one of the coordinates you can extract the other. Public keys with only one coordinate is called "compressed". So for each private key you can have two versions of the public key, which hash into two different bitcoin addresses.

I was answering to "why would anyone use bitcoins to buy things if it's more expensive to obtain them than using a CC directly".
One reason is to be paid in bitcoins directly. Another is, for any country outside USA it gets much cheaper. I get 8% more money by getting paid in bitcoins than via PayPal. Not 1%, not 2.9%. For every $1000 I get at least $80 more (or rather, not lose $80 in fees and shitty exchange rates) by getting paid in bitcoins.

Yep. 99.999% I'd say. Some people/organizations can extract overwritten data, but only from hard drives where there are very high probabilities that the extracted information is worth more than the cost of trying to extract it. Nobody will do that on randomly disposed hard drives.

If you put both a piece of paper and a pendrive in a vault for a hundred of years, I would vote on the paper. Even in the event of water damage there's still a way to read the info. A pendrive may stop working randomly. You can't know if there's a manufacturing defect, while you can know at first sight if a piece of paper is too brittle.
Add a bit of more protection (plastic) and the winner is clear.

Yes, Electrum and the BIP in development that is based on Electrum idea. It's the *only* type of brainwallet I recommend. It's 128 bits only, but it's secure as it uses key stretching and produces an unlimited stream of addresses, not only one.

JPEG is lossy compression. It means it discard information, it gives you approximate chunks of images that resemble the original, but needs much less space.
PNG is lossless compression. The image data (usually 32 bits per pixel) is compressed with gzip. When you uncompress it, you get exactly the same image data, with the same bits. It can be lossy, though, if you e.g. reduce the amount of colors before saving it as PNG. The format itself is not lossy.

Nobody noticed yet that the backup is vulnerable? Almost every app can read the whole SD card. And the Mycelium files aren't encrypted by the PIN, as other people say. It would be compromised even if the new ROM was not rooted.
Even if Mycelium authors encrypt the wallet with the PIN with a key derivation algo so it takes 30 seconds to derive the key, it would still be vulnerable. Unless the PIN is 8 numbers, then it may take a year to crack.

Litecoin it's too similar to bitcoin but it was the first non-premined scrypt coin, has momentum, age and the potential of being "the other cryptocurrency". They're currently on a donation drive to update the codebase. Some merchants accept it.
Feathercoin just copies it. There will be no difference once litecoin is updated. It's one of the coins recently released which are basically mine-and-dump.
But as I always say, a real bitcoin alternative should be **much** better, with clear advantages for everybody. Faster confirmation time of litecoin is very nice but that's not enough.

[Fennec.name]( didn't update the price during the weeks before and after the bubble burst (either that or they're using a rounded average), I think that counts.
Also I know several bitcoin believers that price things always in bitcoins because, as they say *bitcoin always recover*, and it seems it's true. Eventually more and more goods and services will be priced independent of the fiat/btc exchange rate because people will believe it cannot suddenly drop without recovery. That very belief actually supports itself.
For the time being, weighted average exchange rate is the way to go.

**MANUALLY** created brain wallets are dangerous, because those are not random, no matter how hard you try to come with an unique passphrase. Brain wallets generated with Electrum are secure because the seed is given to you, you don't select the 12 words, they're truly random.
The only way to generate a secure brain wallet manually is using dice to create a very long passphrase.
The XKCD assumes 4 **random** words with 1000 attempts per second. Funnily a lot of people used variations of XKCD's example as their password.

A paper wallet is secure because you generate it offline, in a PC without internet connection. If it's from an Ubuntu live CD, even better. Once you have the (empty) paper wallet, you just transfer the funds there. Several small wallets are better than one big one.
If you just copy your existing keys, you're not securing it enough: your wallet.dat can still be stolen with a virus.

Those words have 128 bits of entropy. They're much secure than if you were choosing those 12 words. For each combination, an attacket must hash the seed 100000 times with sha-256, then calculate 5 public keys (secp256k1, sha256 twice, ripemd-160, for each public key) to check if that combination has an used address.
If you don't feel confident enough, make several brainwallets. Or, as suggested by other people, make paper wallets with bitaddress.org.

Brainwallets are secure as long as they are completely random. (e.g. with Electrum).

Because two-factor protects you from keyloggers but not from other type of trojans, phising, etc: two-factor in bc.info gives you the complete encrypted wallet, while in other sites (such as mtgox) only gives you access to the command you're executing (login, withdrawal...).

That's the location of the first node where blockchain saw the transaction relayed. It may not be the node that created the transaction. That information is inaccurate, but if you're still concerned, use Electrum or an online wallet; and if you're really paranoid, use bitcoin over Tor.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:48:42
Let's see the use case for each service, step by step. Assuming your PC has a trojan.
MtGox, let's suppose you only have two-factor auth enabled for withdrawal.
* Login into MtGox with username and password. Attacker got your username and password or your session cookie.
* Withdraw bitcoins, type quantity, address, two-factor code, then withdraw button.
* Attacker got all that data but cannot use the code again.
* Type wallet ID, password and two-factor code.
* BC.info sends the whole encrypted wallet to your browser.
* Attacker got your encrypted wallet and your password.
* Withdraw some bitcoins using your second password.
* Attacker got your second password too. Now he has total control of your wallet.
The advantage of BC.info over MtGox and other online wallets is that when somebody hacks that website and gets all wallets, they cannot get your bitcoins. Thousands of bitcoins was robbed from InstaWallet but the same cannot happen with BC.info.

If you insist on making a manual brainwallet, save  to a pendrive and use it offline.

LTC and NMC are the only bitcoin-based alt-chains that will survive. And I'm not sure about NMC. People look at alternatives, LTC is the only one that gained some traction and NMC has an specific use. All the rest are just mine-and-dump.

If you want to hold them **and** help the BTC economy, spend them at the same time you buy more of them. Of course this means you should have enough fiat money to spend.

Bitcoin solves many problems other currencies doesn't.
In comparison with bitcoin, the rest of cryptos are flawed because all of them carry the main problems of bitcoin. And it's not energy consumption.
So, if the features are very similar, the thing that matter is adoption.

Retailers that sell bitcoins upen receiving them is not different than users selling them directly. The vast majority of those bitcoins are bought first.

Bitcoin is based on ECDSA, SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. PGP is a "wrapper" protocol for multiple asymetric crypto algorhithms.

You give the two-factor code to BC.info, BC.info gives you the whole encrypted wallet. Attacker gets the whole encrypted wallet, doesn't need two-factor code, just the passwords. Two-factor codes (at least google auth and yubikey) can't be used for encryption, just authentification against a server.

The difficulty is computed based on the *existing* blocks of the chain. The moment you stop submitting winning blocks, the difficulty with decrease. The bitcoin network doesn't care about "shares" in pools.

Bitcoin has 11 million reasons to be thoroughly audited. Also it's more a P2P protocol more than an application. All data managed by the application (except the private keys) are public and broadcasted.
PHP applications on the other side are made to be run in a trusted enviroment, with databases full of private information. PSN full user database was compromised and they're still running the business. If they were using bitcoin, Sony would be bankrupt.

You don't have "coins" but transactions you can redeem making a new one. If you have received a transaction with 1 BTC, and you want to send me 0.1 BTC, you create a new transaction where 0.1 goes to me and 0.9 goes to yourself. That proccess is made by your bitcoin wallet automatically.
Each transaction can have any number of input/output coins, as long as it's valid. It costs the same to send 0.0001 bitcoins than to send 10000 bitcoins: the miners do the same work verifying them.

An alternate cryptocurrency needs to be **much** better than bitcoin. Litecoin had 2 slight advantages, one of them didn't last for long. The other one is not very significant.

He made a leveraged trading platform called Bitcoinica that stabilized the price a lot for months. It was hacked (alongside other bitcoin sites hosted in Linode) but kept running. It was bought by the people of Intersango (the now defunct UK exchange).
Amir Taaki (a.k.a. genjix), who made the first bitcoin-compatible implementation from scratch, and part of Intersango, leaked Bitcoinica code without removing a hard-coded password that it was also used in the e-mail account, so someone resetted all passwords, stole all the bitcoins and deleted all the database. There was no backup.
I don't know many details, so anyone correct me if I'm wrong.

Blockchain.info in theory is more secure as all keys are encrypted client-side. Since no JS code has been modified (as far as we know), the problem probably is malware or phising. Ironically, two factor auth is almost useless in BC.info.
As usual my recommendation is [Electrum]( in a Linux machine. I don't trust Windows for managing a single bitcent.
edit: Definitely, I think the weak link is the phone.

We've asking them to accept bitcoin for years. The least we can do is give them some publicity. This benefits all bitcoin users.

Transaction fees makes that type of attack very expensive.
Waiting just some seconds for 0-confirmation transactions are okay for very small quantities. An attack to reverse it would be more more expensive than that.

Proof-of-work requires an algorithm hard to compute but very fast to check its validity. The algorithm is just SHA256, which is a one-way function. Miners are calculating partial collisions; the harder the difficulty, the bigger the partial collision has to be.

The bitcoin.org client generates a pool of 100 addresses to be used either as regular addresses or change addresses, and it generates other 100 when needed. Backup every ~50 transactions you make.
Electrum generates all addresses from the initial seed, so only one backup is needed. You can also write the seed down as backup.
For blockchain.info, a backup is needed only when you add new addresses.

Your bank has control of that money. You can't send it instantly anywhere. You can't receive a credit card payment and be 100% sure it won't be reversed (until after 1-3 months). Your funds can be frozen for any reason.

The encrypted keys are stored (in local storage, I guess), but the password that decrypt those keys are not.
Also I meant: BC.info is more secure than other online wallets.
The phone version is not secure (any root app has access to the keys).

You're assuming ASICs will be affordable and that's not true. The reason there's so much GPU mining is that GPUs are made for other purposes and can be resold. The reason ASICs are made are to be profitable exclusively for mining. No more ASICs will be made when they reach profitability.


The point is that bitcoin will make obsolete things like visa and mastercard which consumes much more energy.


My point. Only rich people can afford that. With a deflationary currency, everybody's coins gain in value.


Not different enough. Also most people will choose a deflationary currency with very high network effect and a cool name than a currency that enlarges the gap between rich and poor.
A real alternative to bitcoin must be **much** better than bitcoin.

My money is not in MtGox, it's safe in my bitcoin wallet. I'm in for the long run because for the first time in the history I can **own** virtual money. The fact of *owning* it and being able to send it quickly anywhere is the real value of bitcoin. This is not a stock. Bitcoin hasn't failed to do what it does.

When I have bitcoins I'm the sole responsible of them. My brainwallet cannot be frozen or seized in any way. I can carry it absolutely anywhere as long as I'm able to recall those 12 words. And of course I can use it absolutely anywhere as long as I have internet access.

You need an encrypted wallet to crack in the first place.
Also, if you mean spending bitcoins that are not yours... mining is finding partial collisions with SHA256, while cracking a private key means finding *full* collision against, ECDSA, SHA256 and RIPEMD160 all at the same time.
