Exactly.  This is more for the camera and the constituents.  I will bet It'll be back up and "running" by Monday.

I would scan them using an app like COINOMI, you very well might have just found "buried treasure".

I have, routinely.  I teach people, about 3-4 times a year, how to enter the cryptomarket.  I don't give them investment advice, but I point out materials for them to read.  
Multiple people are VERY happy with me right now. One of the easiest examples is my niece who spent $500 to purchase 0.2 BTC last summer...she hasn't touched it...she just checks the balance every couple of weeks and smiles.

Seriously?  This is what is important?  What?  We need to RAM cryptocurrency down women's throats for their own good?  
For the record, the four women in my house slept in while I cleaned the house, made homemade biscuits, got a slow cooker of chili going, and made a couple of crypto trades.  
Who is enslaved again?

This is where I run "afoul" with some Bitcoin fanatics.  While BTC started out as a decentralized, trust less, peer to peer network, it has effectively morphed into a more traditional "store of value".  
BTC is far more safe than a lot of shady banks and over reaching governments.  Look at the meltdown in Greece a few years back--the Government instituted capital constraints and people watched helplessly as their life savings melted away.  
What BTC offers is a safe way to store that value in a manner that can be accessed from anywhere in the globe (and safe from 3rd party interference) 
Like any "new" thing, it will have ups and downs, highs and lows.  I compare BTC more to a traditional "Savings Account".  I put money there I have NO intention of using for a long time.  
As I "need" to pay bills, transact for daily purchases, or conduct routine business, I use my checking account.  This is where I (personally) move value from my savings account (BTC) into a more liquid form of payment option (in my case through an exchange like GDAX).  
As a preference, I like Litecoin for daily transactions.  As as store of value I prefer Bitcoin.

I would put your coin on a paper wallet--copy it--and put both of them in a location that only you know about and will have access too.  
There is NO way a paper wallet can be hacked.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:01:21
No.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:17:39
Supply and demand.  In short a lot of people are beginning to see real utility in have a means to protect their wealth from corrupt governments, hyper inflation, and a lack of reliable banking.  
In short, this isn't a bubble--its adoption.  
Yes, there will be corrections and downturns, but those green candles are going up for quite some time.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:59:05
...as long as there is an internet.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:30:37
Great article.  
I was just posting on this in another forum and suggested that most of the world does not have access to safe, secure, reliable banking with relatively low fees. 
Most of the world is fairly unstable; both politically, financially, and with regards to security.
The current uptick in digital currency is not about 100 million Americans moving to crypto in order to by coffee; this is about 4-5 billion people looking for a safe way to store their value and wealth from corrupt regimes and financial instability.
I think crypto is here to stay--and I think it is going to get big in a way people can't even imagine. What's crazier--the growth will come from nations that haven't traditionally held that much financial influence.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:20:55
No there will *STILL* be only 21 million Bitcoins ever mined.  
Every hard fork is like a branch off of a tree.  The trunk of the tree remains the same length despite how many branches (in the case forks) occur.

The closest I have seen to a "Bitcoin day" is 22 May, which commemorates the first transaction in 2010.
If I have a vote--that's the day I would chose.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:55
Exactly.  This is the normal "two step" that comes with every pump.  People with the coins sell them to the people that want the coins.  Generally speaking the faster the coin goes up, the quicker it comes down a bit.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:22:06
No problem.  I will start tinkering with it over the next couple of days.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:39
Those are automatic buys kicking in...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:13
Agreed.  But I am guessing a lot of this "new money" has set some pretty tight controls.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:00:32
Very easy to buy.  Any number of exchanges will sell you bitcoin; coinbase is a favorite site of a lot of people.

You know everybody was at that party too!  ETH and LTC both took VERY wild swings!

I am thinking it will be nearer to $9K in early December as the curious get interested in it after BBT.

Just watched it here...amazing!

I just did the same thing--can't wait to see the results amongst my friends.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:17:12
I actually teach a couple of classes a month on what crypto currency is, how its used, and (if people are interested) the basics on trading.  
From my perspective I actually get more "statements" than I do questions; it seems a lot of people have already made up their minds on how the value system works.  
The analogy I use is akin to the matrix quote where Morpheus tells Neo "Fiat is a system. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."
With that in mind, the typical "statements" I get are the following:
Bitcoin is illegal used for buying drugs, guns, and porn on the dark web. 
Bitcoin should be illegal, only criminals and hackers use it--I heard someone used it in a crime.  
Bitcoin isn't real, no one can actually buy anything with bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is a PONZI scheme and is about to crash. 
I generally take about one to two hours talking people (that are willing to take red pill) and walk them through the following things:
History of currency.  I talk to them how we, as a species, started trading and moved into the currency.  I talk them through the introduction of minted and printed money and why banks came into being.  
I discuss the concept of bitcoin, the white paper, and how bitcoin got started.  I describe in very basic terms how transactions are conducted, the blockchain, and role of the miners. 
I use Jullian Assange as a case study in how very vulnerable we are as citizens when the government decides individuals are "enemies of the state" and how dependent we are on the financial institutions that are controlled by the government.  
I transition then into talking about how this same system can be used to support people, business, or charities; I use the Bitcoin Guy as a great example.  I then have people jump a blockchain explorer and see what value was transferred for themselves.  
I then have them look at CoinATM radar and see where various ATMs are that can dispense case.  I walk them through Coinbase and show how money can be transferred back and forth.  I talk to them about other means like the Shift card which uses the visa network and debits their BTC wallet.  
Finally, I usually have them download the coinomi app on their phone and I use RDD to practice doing a couple of simple transactions.  Lastly, if they are still interested, I have them generate a couple of paper wallets.  They then learn to create, transfer, and sweep coins from wallets they created 5 minutes prior.  
Now they are ready to start reading....

I was just trying to play along with your joke...I have said numerous times; BTC is the current that floats ALL boats (coins).
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:14:10
Really awesome!  I  like the visualizations!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:23
Heck with these price swings I am thinking about taking a swing at $8K!
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:29:33
Okay to be fair, this is the first time a group citizens have ever stood up a value transfer mechanism that is separate from a government.  This is breaking ground in a number of societies throughout the world.  To be honest I think it is harder for people in the US to see the utility in BTC because the majority of Americans have access to secure banking, low interest rates, and reasonable fiscal regulations. 
It’s going to be the people in 3rd world countries and who live in unstable conditions who will lead the way; mostly because necessity is the mother of invention.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:31:29
Yes.  Sorry what a dolt I was!
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:35
I actually spend a few hours each month teaching people how to use crypto--in fact I am teaching tomorrow and I will probably use this as  my opening line!
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:40:33
Absolutely.  I just went through Europe (coming from the States) and had zero problems.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:31:36
While I don't argue with the general premise of the article, I believe BTC's success will not be attributed to a few million Americans.  I summit this is more about giving 3-4 billion underbanked people access to a secure means to store their wealth as opposed to relying on crappy fiat currency, corrupt financial institutions, and chaotic security situations.  
Digital currency is the future; it has little to do with the dollar.

I live in North Carolina, he lives in Michigan.  We only "physically" see each other maybe once every 2 years.  We talk two to three times a week.  As a true back up my wife knows where the keys are too, though she isn't comfortable making any real trades.  
By the way, it's a great question--I am not sure many people have thought this through.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:31:51
I really don't think any real regulation is going to change crypto.  It didn't work with alcohol, tobacco, drugs, porn, music, movies, or any number of items.  
All it will do is change is how people trade coins, it will drive the market underground. 
If you really want to get involved, there is a congressional caucus that is formed to look at these types of regulations; maybe you should contact one or two members?

BTC transactions can take some time.  How long has it been since he "paid" you and when he sent you the screen shot?
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:46:56
I agree that right NOW the underbanked have limited access, but that is changing.  Look at Venezuela--digital currency is flourishing over there--demand is off the charts.  
Lots of very poor people are starting to get informed.  Just the other day one Reddit user announced his / her gains were sufficient to live without working.  When the numbers got thrown around, it was discovered that he / she lived in south east asia.   
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:10:15
No.  You need to see the hash to verify it on the block chain.
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:50:26
I hate to disagree with you, but in your example only one BTC exists (in the hands of the escort).  All you have is a "promise" from your friend he will return your BTC.  
He has to mow the hookers yard, fix her sink, and paint the shutters, so that she will pay him 1 BTC so he can return the BTC he owes you.
Only the person holding the BTC has the "value"; everyone else just holds promises--and when promises are broken, the illusion of your value disappears.
Just like in fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:41:49
I am guessing 1 BTC will equal 1 BTC!  ;)
Just kidding, $4342
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:25:31
Everyplace has limits.  Methods (such as local Bitcoinmeetup) without "limits" will eat into the value of your BTC.  The other thing to consider is your tax burden (depending on where you live).  Seriously consider an exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:58:46
More like Petro CRASH
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:30:11
Sorry if I came off as "antibank", I'm not.  Lending value is a great way to grow your wealth; but it is only as good as the people that you lend your money too.
Banks are supposed to vet and ensure anyone they loan money to has the resources and means to repay that debt.  When they over extend themselves (or trade that promissory note to another institution) and a crisis occurs, they have little choice left.
In the case of the US Government we just transferred that debt to the government.  I think people confuse value with promissory notes, one is real the other is just a promise.
A bank run on BTC can run into the same problem too if they aren't careful.
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:36:36
We totally agree.  What BTC allows is more control.
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:15:26
You realize that every transaction on the blockchain is public record.  Forever.  In perpetuity.  
You can't "clean" a bitcoin.  The best you can do is obfuscate the relationship between the public address and you.  
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:24:28
Any update?
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:06:56
They might as well try and "ban" dancing...
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:29:52
I can't say for certain about *THIS* transaction, but if he is legit, he should be able to provide you a transaction ID.  
Above is a screen shot of a transaction I did with a student of mine (I volunteer to teach guys how to get into digital currency).  I use RDD (mostly because its VERY cheap and has super fast confirmations).  
If you look at the picture, it has a lot of information:  date, time, confirmations, how much, the recipients address, and most important the transaction id.  
This is what you should be looking for.
