We doing this circlejerk back to back or are we going to look at each other?

I enjoy roads, cheap clean water, police, and fire service. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:53:25
Here's an actual answer to the question:
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:57:48
It was still too much of a pain in the ass to convert currencies last time I used it. (1+ year ago)  
MTGox wanted my drivers license and shit and we all know how that turned out for them.  Ended up using some other exchange to buy a seedbox.  Seedbox ended up being shit and there was no way to get my money back. Gave up after that. Just takes up too much time to keep up with all of it. 
That and all the hacks that were going on made me lose interest. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:02:40
I got out of MTGox and thus the bitcoin scene shortly after it was hacked 2 years ago. The way it was handled should have thrown up red flags for everyone.  Shit company with shady as fuck management.  Honestly, those who have been around bitcoin since the beginning like myself saw this coming 100 miles away. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:04:40
So much angst
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:16:12
Actually, I haven't been wrong about anything at all since then so I guess it must have been solar flares/swamp gas interfering. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:40:49
You said the middle class doesn't want government.  
As a middle class person, I do enjoy some government services.  
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:30:44
Guess I was wrong.  So many lolz!
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:24:07
No.  I mined them up until the first crash ($20 to $1). Broke even after the power bills and got a couple video cards out of it.  Got sick of $200 power bills so I quit. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:44:40
It wasn't back then. It was bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:46:33
Honestly, I haven't thought about it at all and probably will continue to not think about it unless it's forced in front of me.  At this point I'm part of the demographic that bitcoin needs to reach if it wants wider adoption.   
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:07:20
Guess I was wrong. 
Here's a fun story for you all to giggle at:
I had 25+ BTC when I cashed out and sold my miners. 
@ $21 per,  I thought I had made a fortune at the time. Paid for my rigs and electricity with a little to spare.  [Couple years ago I saw that were at $1000.]( 
Based on all the threatening and taunting PMs I'm getting from a comment I made 1/2 a decade ago, looks like the community hasn't changed much. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:21:43
It'll remain up too.  I like the discussion, even though I was wrong. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:19:24
Nah.  I'll pay for questionable purchases every now and then with it, but I imagine the mining world is a rich mans game now. 
If you guys weren't around in the beginning, you missed the wild fucking west of BTC.  You'd wake up and have a few more bitcoins over night...sometimes your rigs would crash and you'd lose your wallet.dat.  NBD...just need to mine another week to get caught back up. Mining communities would pop up and then shut down for seamingly no reason.  When BTC hit $1, people lost their fucking minds.  People would pay for pizzas with a couple bit coins. Namecoin and a bunch of other crypto currencies would pop up over night.  Half the community was screaming ponzy scheme, the other half was screaming its going to replace the dollar...It was fun.
@_date: 2019-03-14 10:27:36
That's the least of their issues right now.

@_date: 2018-10-09 21:10:45
That's pretty optimistic.  I would look at it and think, "Rat.  Weird." and continue on with my day. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:03:12
Don't you think for around 1/2 million dollars I would have exhausted all options?  Account is gone.  They purge them if you're inactive for a period of time.  Bitcoin was $1 at that time, so I didn't really care. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:56:34
I had 40 or so sitting in a dropbox account that expired.  
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:24:30
Because you can't.  They are gone.

Bitcoin will never be anything more than a currency for nerds in it's current form. It's too hard to use and too easy to get scammed.  Not a popular opinion around these parts but it's true.

That's not as bad.  I haven't traded BTC for a while so maybe it's getting better. As long as I dont have to give them my info and just need to verify the amounts. 
@_date: 2012-12-07 00:41:07
I assumed that was going to be another 2 bit startup that would be hacked within a couple months and mysteriously close it's doors. But reading into it, this is actually a good thing.

And you've lost all credibility. 
@_date: 2012-01-12 03:46:45
The put my account up for review and I looked at the process to verify it.  It'll be a cold day in hell before I send MTGox the documents they were requesting.  I have accounts with Fidelity and a couple other brokerage houses and they never asked for that info. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:45:21

@_date: 2011-08-17 01:37:02
My Dad built a business from scratch and is all about self made wealth. His simple words, "Good for you," actually meant a lot to me which isn't conveyed correctly in the original post. 
@_date: 2011-06-13 00:08:49
The whole rig was only $400 after rebates and whatnot so even if the whole thing tanks the way I look at it is I got some decent video cards out of the deal.

We're not discouraging you, just telling you how it is. Download guiminer and try it if you're that curious.  216Mhash isn't going to do shit to the difficulty so really we don't care.  You're going to lose dollars on electricity but gain a bitcoin in about a week and a half.

This is the correct way.  I still dont understand why people are using paypal or google checkout. 
@_date: 2011-08-07 00:58:21
No, it's going down because you can't buy anything with them and people are using it as a speculative way to make money.

Im done with mtgox.
@_date: 2011-08-22 01:20:37
1.  Even if you own it already: probably not.  I get about 216 mhash/sec on one of mine.  At $10/btc that's about 33 dollars a month.  Just guessing but around 275Watts of power is going to cost you around $30 / month to run it at $.148 per kilowatt/hr.  So if you run 24/7 you would make 3 dollars a month profit. 
2.  You could but it's going to eat into your profit because it's going to require more electricity.  Do NOT discount the price of electricity.   I have a small operation (1Ghash/month) and it costs about $100/month to run it. 
3.  Not a factor.  You won't notice any slowdowns. 
4.  You build one for 300-500 bucks depending on the parts you have laying around.  It will not produce a decent amount of bitcoins.  It will not pay for itself in anything less than 8 months.  
Mining isn't the get rich quick thing it used to be. 
@_date: 2011-07-27 22:29:52
I'm going to use whatever has the lowest fees. 
@_date: 2011-08-04 01:37:15
Ohh look.  This thread again. 
@_date: 2011-09-04 13:26:18
I hope so too but the way it's looking now it's not going to happen.  I'm getting ready to shut down some miners at $7.
@_date: 2011-09-04 03:04:36
I don't understand these posts. Why not just buy them like everyone else?
@_date: 2011-06-28 12:13:05
Why don't you have a bank account?
@_date: 2011-08-22 06:32:20
MTgox.  Its a currency exchange.  You're still buying from someone but it's through an exchange. 
@_date: 2011-08-20 14:53:00
I have 3 rigs at 1.1Ghash.  At $10/btc I net $186 and profit $83.  My rigs aren't payed off yet (I have $700 invested) and realistically won't be before the payout goes to 25btc / block.  As long as I stay profitable though I'll continue mining.  Pays my elec bill every month which frees up cash flow plus it's fun. 
@_date: 2011-09-04 02:58:08
I wouldn't return it.  I'm kind of a dick like that. 
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:15:51
No one is saying, "Purchase an item with them." This is why this whole thing is destination to fail.
@_date: 2011-06-12 21:21:50
Already am in a mining pool.  My 5750's are chugging away at 150 MHash per card.  So it seems to me the time to get in is right now.  Before the government steps in (they will) and before everyone else knows about it. Don't you agree?
@_date: 2011-06-24 11:49:21
Congratulations! You'll never pay it off mining but you're going to have an awesome rig for BF3.
@_date: 2011-09-12 00:44:48
At 6 dollar BTC there are actually pretty good deals on there but I'm skeptical of this claim: 


@_date: 2011-10-16 19:01:32
@_date: 2011-10-24 11:37:33
It's already unprofitable to mine if you pay for your own power. 
@_date: 2011-09-07 02:26:07
I'm skeptical. Everyone wants to believe they will but really there is no reason for a dramatic rise other than rampant speculation which is basically what is propping up the market now. 
@_date: 2011-08-22 06:25:14
If you really want to help the cause you should buy stuff with bitcoins.  That's what they are for.  Not investing or making a profit. 
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:37:08
You've made a huge mistake. 
@_date: 2011-12-20 13:07:06

@_date: 2011-06-14 12:09:35
If he thinks he's going to build a datacenter for $10k then he's in for a rude awakening.   
@_date: 2011-06-12 22:27:29
You're right.  I did double check and it's significantly less but the rig would still pay for itself in about a month.  I can handle that. Afterwards it's basically free money. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 00:54:29
@_date: 2011-06-12 23:42:20
I've come to the opinion that no one really knows what their talking about on this subreddit (myself included).  For every doom and gloom post there is a post on the opposite side. 
@_date: 2011-12-20 02:55:31
Less than 20.

@_date: 2011-10-12 01:37:40
Unless you have dirt cheap (think &gt; .05/kwh at these prices) electricity you will not be profitable.  I shut off my miners at $6. Running 3 rigs at 1111 mhash cost $92 per month at .14 kwh.

@_date: 2011-07-06 03:24:53
Also fuck nortel  because their switches are garbage.  We have a couple hundred and about once a month we have to RMA one. 
@_date: 2011-08-07 15:16:36
So your going to use company hardware and electricity to mine bitcoins for personal profit?  Pretty greasy. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 21:11:07
I have that factored into my rig.  The electricity is payed for in the first 2 days of a month. Everything else seems to be gravy. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:24:03
Thx. Im going to reflash the card bios tonight and try again. 
@_date: 2011-10-19 11:52:35
I'm going to say something that is unpopular:
This article is spot on.  Bitcoin will be basically dead in a about 6 months.  
@_date: 2011-09-09 21:29:51

Can I have some money to light on fire as well? 
@_date: 2011-10-19 00:58:32
Yeah my miners have been off for about a month now.  Makes me wonder what the guys that dropped 10k into rigs are doing now days. 
@_date: 2011-08-06 23:08:15
I just shutdown 2 workers on my main desktop. 7.50 is my break even on electricity.  If it hits 9 again, I'll fire them back up.  I still have 2 more running on a more efficient box. At $6 they will be done. Be smart people.  Don't buy yet and don't mine at a loss. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 14:42:50
Your prices are fairly competitive. You need eGo-T tanks though.  Where do you get your liquid?
@_date: 2011-12-25 14:35:20
It'll be a cold day in hell before I send MTGox information like that.  "Here, please steal my identity." 
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:35:13

@_date: 2011-08-12 01:08:31

Same issue.  Bank not supported.  Wants a wire transfer.  Not going to do a $30 wire transfer for $50 in bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:59:46
Sooo how do you actually fucking buy a bitcoin now days?  Coinbase won't verify my bank accounts for whatever reason.  Cash App doesn't either.  I've already called my bank to put my accounts on a white list...thinking they have fraud getting tripped.  No dice.   It's really disconcerting to upload my bank cards and scans of my license and still not be verified.     
When I bought coins originally it was MtGox and basically the wild west.  Pretty difficult for this to ever take hold when I have to go through some shady looking 3rd party local market to actually get them.
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:02:53
I heard 8
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:41:45
Neither of those are an option here.
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:21:33
Yeah, I'm not going to dick with any of that. Don't care that much.    It needs to be as easy to get as regular money if it's going to be universally accepted and available.
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:38:34


This looks promising.  Some serious markups though....
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:42:53
And even that doesn't work worth a shit.
@_date: 2013-01-14 00:22:06
It goes against the idea that bitcoins are literally the most important invention of the 21st century.

You guys obviously weren't around for the first bubble.  This will happen again. Price is going to next to nothing again.  It'll stay that way for a while.  Everyone will forget about bitcoin.  Then it will start ramping up again in price, and repeat for a new bubble.

And they'll back to 10 in about 2 months.  This has happened before and everyone was reacting exactly the same.  It's a bubble.

Selling prescription drugs anonymously with alternative currency?  What could possibly go wrong?  Governments should be fine with that.

I learned my lesson last bubble.

I didn't imply that.  Said they would be back to 10 in the next couple months.  If they are at 10, then by definition they aren't worthless.  I've been saving mine for exactly this bubble.  A lot of people have been.

Everyone obviously wasn't around for when they were hacked.  The whole site is a joke. I can't believe people are scanning copies of their drivers licenses and handing over SS to these clowns.

It's too fucking complicated to get into the system.  I've been out since the last bubble and I went to MTGox and saw all the payment options and ways to transfer currency around.  Imagine your mom looking at that.  She'd have no idea what's going on.  I don't know what's going on.

So how long until that get's hacked or your guy's servers blow up and you lose the data?

I saw this shit MILES away coming from my experience with the first bubble.  It's been fun to watch.

MtGox fucking up?  Impossible.

No one forces you to go to college.  Be a welder or something like that and make gobs of money.
