If you can do it on a PC, you can build an ASIC to do it.

Could very well be a ponzi.  They take all the fiat, spend it on lavish lifestyles-- and actually use maybe 1/2 the money to purchase BTC for reserves.  They fake some of the bid/ask data and use the BTC reserves to send to people who withdraw their BTC.  Maybe those reserves have gone to zero.

I am not terribly familiar with the inner working of scrypt.  I was just using the CAM as an example. 
A CAM would be useful if you are doing a lookup in a table.  Software relies on trees and other methods which usually which need to be traversed.  A CAM can spit out a result in one cycle.  Power costs are typically high.
Having custom made hardware would allow one to use such parts.

If we want it to become accepted, we need merchants to accept it.  Doing so will cause them some work.  Sticking with the status quo is easy. 
If they go through the effort and no one uses that avenue and instead spends dollars, the next merchant will be less likely to use it.

An MS in CS is the low man on the totem pole at my office.  Most are PhD in EE, and physics right behind them.  We do have a few in the former category.  
You are referring to the proof of stake instead of the proof of work concept.  
In some ways you are correct.  Design by committee can end up in catastrophe.  Proof of stake is a little different though.  If one individual can take control; no one would adopt it.  Not much different than an ultra powerful miner in Bitcoin today.
However, take this story into account.
Back in the day, my boss was on the ATM steering committee.  Some people wants 32 byte ATM cells, others wanted 64 bytes.  The committee compromise on 48 byte payloads which no one wanted.  The overheader way 7 bytes per cell; so I think we ended up with a 53 bytes ATM cell.  Crazy; but it ended up working.  Most vendors used 64 bytes of memory and would append 9 internal bytes to each cell for internal switching.  Ended up working great for all HW vendors.  
It really matters where you end up.  Most likely; the most adopted smart contract language has not been invented yet.  
To me; Tezos is the best candidate to become the Microsoft Excel of smart contracts where people with financial skills will be able to construct contracts without a programmer handy.  Others could come along; but it is by far the most dynamic and scalable protocol we have seen thus far.

I agree with you.
I sort of laugh when people talk about how the financial bailout was a success because "the banks paid back the money with interest".
If the bailout is to be viewed as an investment: it was a shit one.  The bailouts occurred when the stock market was about 1/3 to 1/4 of the value it is today.  The return there was in the single percentages: and brain dead investment analyst could have yields you 300% return.  
Governments aren't supposed to invest in assets.  Infrastructure, education and other public goods maybe: but not financial ones.

I can use dollars anywhere I want and you have to take them (in the us at least).  They cannot be lost if I don't backup my system.  The bank holds them and they are insured.  
I love bit coins but there are pros and cons to each.

Take your original investment off the table and let the rest of it ride.  You could probably say you made nothing on the transaction and pay no tax.

Yes, they are recorded as a liability.  But from day one of finance 101 we learn that..... 
equity + liabilities = assets
So since they want their balance sheet to balance (ie. the point of the balance sheet)-- they record the liabilities for the deposits as you so wisely point out.
Now, the equation in unbalanced.  You can either reduce capital (equity) by a similar amount, or add to the asset side of the equation to make it balance.
Since they have more money to loan out-- they add to the asset side of their balance sheet.  That is an asset they will use to make more money in the future since they will be loaning out out.
Suppose you withdraw money.  They reduce their liability by that amount; and also reduce their assets by that amount.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:55:43
No.  Deposits are assets and liabilities.

I have a friend in the Philippines who I finally got through to today.  I thought he might be dead.  He works for an NGO, and said that the big charities (like the RC and Oxfam) have the infrastructure in place to help people TODAY and people need the help today.  If you don't have Bitcoins-- give money.  Today, Bitcoins are still in their infancy and the NGOs will have to convert them anyhow.  We shouldn't be using this crisis to promote Bitcoin.
Where he said the NGOs fail (he worked in many crisis zones) is in the rebuilding stage.  People are very, very generous to the charities during the crisis, but once it passes-- they move on to the next disaster.  Look at Haiti-- it is still a disaster zone.  
If people were to donate Bitcoins during a disaster-- he said it could be to local groups which will remain in the community during the rebuilding process and have a vested local interest.  The Red Cross will mostly be gone by then.  Bitcoins have a store of value which could be donated during the disaster "PR boom" and, since they are a store of value, saved for the inevitable rebuilding projects.  
He said often times the local bank would be wiped out, and sometime a crisis of confidence in the local currency wipes out its value.  The price of rebuilding materials skyrockets; and nothing ever gets rebuilt. 
This is where I could see us making a real difference; donating directly to the communities hit for the rebuilding phase.  Allowing them to save for the proper time and then using that capital when it is appropriate for them and not some outside group.
Problem is opening up those lines of communication to the appropriate people....

Sell half-- diversify and let half ride.  It isn't black or white.  If he sells half and it tanks he can say he won.  If it goes bonkers he still wins.
I put 1/3rd of my bitcoins in Litecoins a year or so ago.  It was a mistake in hindsite but if those became the dominant cryptocurrency I would have been set.  I am still up-- just not as much as I could have been.

These are great points.  I think the use of Bitcoin for everyday purchases is something that may be a long ways off.  Using it on Amazon to buy goods is where I think we will first see its use.  
The volatility is a huge problem.  Businesses don't want to see you something in the morning for X Bitcoins, only to cash in those coins for X/2 at the end of the day.  Those businesses have their accounts payable in their local currencies.  Having receivables in something that swings so wildly may present losses. 
If receivables were denominated in BTC it would be another story.
I almost wonder if it would be best for some in the BTC community who have large holdings to get together and provide some stability.  ie.  They say we buy BTCs at X dollars, and sell them at X + 3.  Next week, we will buy then at 1.01X, and sell them at 1.01*X + 3.
It would take an enormous amount of BTC and cash to do it.
That way the price stabilizes a bit and businesses can adopt it with less risk.

Well, not sure what you mean by a real deposit?  If I deposit $100 and they loan you $90-- that is real money.  You or I cannot do that.
You walk into another bank and they would put that $90 in your account.  That is hard money.  They can then use that to loan out.
The scenario is if every recipient of a loan put it into the same bank.  That $100 would create a chain of $100, $90, $81, $72.9, etc... deposits.  They would eventually have $1000 worth of deposits in this perfect scenario.  Your $100 would then become the 10% reserve on that.
They must pay interest to all those depositors; and would collect interest as well.  The problem comes when someone defaults.  The bank is still on the hook to the depositors.  The interest spread should be calculated to cover that risk.

Why would you want to destroy the crypto currency you spent so much on?  The reward for miners is great.  With 40 percent of the power they could expect something like one coin every minute or so.  Ie.. They are making about $700 a minute.   Why would they jeopardize that?
The only thing I can think of is someone has more to gain by destroying it.  Ie.  a central bank or intelligence agency.  I think that is a huge stretch.

They are an exchange-- right?  An exchange has an order book with buyers on one side and sellers on the other....

Well, close.  If the reserve requirement is 10%, they can lend out $90.   Assuming it goes back in the same bank as a deposit, they must keep 9 dollars in reserves and can lend out 81. Keep extending the chain.
