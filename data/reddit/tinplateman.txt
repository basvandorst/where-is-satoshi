Yes, it's natural for any scheme to target the most vulnerable. Drug users are desperate for any means of safely acquiring drugs. Bitcoin speculators falsely advertised their product as being able to help users anonymously buy drugs, but we all know how that ended up.

Yes, assets with no value tend to have wild swings in price like that. Tulips, for instance, acted in a similar way.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:19:48
Yes, the ability to offload a worthless product on people in a tough situation is something to laugh about. More proof that bitcoin is a scam.

Disgusting scare-mongering. You should be arrested.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:16:07
This is how a cryptocurrency should be founded! Bitcoin was founded by an anonymous scammer who mined 10% of the coins before anyone else had a chance (and wrote the protocol to make it easier to mine coins at that time).
Great job Baldur Friggjar Odinsson.

Bitcoin is now about 33% owned by hackers, 25% owned by drug dealers, 10% owned by the US govt., 10% pre-mined by Satoshi, with the scraps left for legitimate users.
It's dead. It was hyped-up out of nothing quickly, and now it's died quickly.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:07:07


Yes they are.


Where can you spend bitcoins? Bitstores?


No, it's a band-aid. You're actually going to lie about what you call a band-aid to further this pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:27:59
More proof that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, the value of which is derived from fear of regret and blackmail, rather than utility.

Bitcoin isn't scarce. See litecoin, dogecoin, coinyewest, etc.

Bitcoin is an open source protocol. It has been successfully copied many times. Trying to pretend that there is only one bitcoin is like pretending that the only dollars are one-dollar bills.
This is very typical behaviour for a scammer: trying to define your terms so they suit your argument.

A Ponzi scheme is one in which an investment fun falsifies its returns. How is bitcoin an investment fund?
A pyramid scheme is one in which a founder sells a common or even worthless product to a group of people, on the promise that they can each sell it to a group of people for a greater value, as long as they make the same promise. Sound familiar? That's as much a definition of pyramid scheme as it is of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:28:36
They're all based on the same protocol. It is nothing like your analogy. $100 bills are backed by a social and legal system that is unique in their jurisdiction. Bitcoin has no such unique characteristic.
And trying to use the common name for each type of bitcoin as an argument? That's like saying, "Band-aids not made by Johnson &amp; Johnson with the Band-Aid branding aren't really band-aids, you can tell by the _name_." If it sticks a tiny bandage to your skin, it's a band-aid.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:12:21
Typical bitcoin lies. Stocks are made of companies! With trucks and contracts and skyscrapers and loads of real shit.

What a bold claim. You know what would be even better? If you could show that the majority of bitcoins were used for that purpose. But you can't, because the majority of bitcoins are hoarded by miners. Most bitcoins have never moved since they were created.
Pointing to the 1% of bitcoins that circulate is like pointing to the 1% of people cured by snake oil.

How much of your money do you spend on interrogating your customers? This is assuming you have some sort of job, of course. Unemployment would be one excuse for your ignorance.
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:50:55
If this part of the scheme was common knowledge, bitcoin would be unsuccessful, being rightly known as a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:37:41
If you weren't enamoured at the thought of free money, you'd be realising that this is a sign of a scam, not a currency.

The comments attacking this post are disgusting. What adult argues that an argument is invalid because the poster has no comment history?
If the people defending bitcoin were professional financial analysts their behaviour would be considered unethical. But there are no professional finance workers here, just a bunch of jokers.

Buy this thing from me that I got in on early. You too can get in early! Not as early as me, but there's still lots of juice in it! All you have to do is buy it from me today and find just five, yes five, buyers and you'll be rich!
P.S this thing has no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:56:17
A good way of teaching a lesson is to relate it to something your listener already has experience of. It isn't "1 IQ point above" anything - whatever that means.
If you work, you'll have some sort of customers/clients, and you might in some way have to judge your customers. But you'll never have to do it as much as banks are expected to. And whatever small checks you have in place, you'll find that they cannot always be completed as well as the person designing the checks would like them to be.
But there's no point talking to you. You are acting like a child.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:11:56
This is how a con works. You have to bully the people pointing out the con, or else they'll tell everyone and the game is up.

Yep, everyone who is against bitcoin is working for the NSA and likes to fuck children. Everyone who is for bitcoin works for Doctors without Borders and is great at cunnilingus.
Nevermind that bitcoin is nothing more than a theft in the form of a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:18:55
Incorrect. Most Bitcoin is actually quite easily stolen. And the  intrinsic value is zero, meaning you'll lose our entire investment at any random point in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:20:25
But cryptocurrencies aren't scarce, so any value they have must be divided by infinity.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:15:32
This is what happens when you buy an asset that has no value other than its market value (i.e. a fraud). Market goes up - everyone's happy. Market goes down - end of the world.
Rather than worrying about your users committing suicide, you should be worried about your users getting murdered. There are a lot of people out there who bought bitcoin above $1000 on _your_ advice, and they have every right to take their pound of flesh.

A private company cannot make a government accept a differnt currency for the payment of taxes. It can, at best, convert the currency to the currency the government accepts.
Your comment looks like more evidence that you're all trying to con new buyers into buying into your scheme.

Again, I said pyramid scheme. Stop trying to hide your crime using misdirection.
And gold is not any sort of scheme. It is a physical asset with real-world applications. You'll find it on a watch, on speaker cables, on the fucking ISS. Can you make a watch out of bitcoin?

@_date: 2013-02-23 20:35:07
Moody's rate credit, not currency.
You still lied, even if you predict the currency will tank, because you said the currency had already tanked.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:17:59
This is why professional investors looks at something called intrinsic value, or fundamentals. Bitcoin's intrinsic value is zero. It does nothing you can't do for free elsewhere and it is redeemable for nothing.

Once again, a stakeholder in bitcoin finds someone to buy bitcoin:
a) knowing that they know nothing about bitcoin,
b) on the promise of unbelievable returns,
c) with no intention of using the bitcoins as a currency.
You are all halfway down a pyramid scheme. You're either ignorant or malicious.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:35:05
I understand the terms completely. You've made a prat of yourself by bringing up concepts that you don't understand.
Please, tell us all what a ponzi scheme is, and how it relates to what he said.
Also, I notice your comment doesn't actually deny that bitcoin is a fraudulent scheme, you only suggest I don't understand which type of scheme it is. A little accidental honesty there?

@_date: 2013-11-19 22:53:06
I would like you to know that bitcoin was designed so that coins were incredibly easy to mine early in the protocol's life. This allowed the founder to mine approximately 10% of all the bitcoins currently in existence.
To me, this makes bitcoin look like more like a greed-driven scam, than an attempt to make a legitimate currency.
A cryptocurrency designed with in the best interests of the people would not have allowed for an insider to reap 10% of the value of all bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:35:05
So, just to be clear, you agree that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, but you defend it on the basis that another currency is also a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:16:02
Except the people using Western Union are engaging in real economic activity, while bitcoin users are moving worthless data between what they call "wallets".
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:02:06
Knowing about it is a prerequisite to mining it.
Writing the currency so that early miners have a massive advantage, and then mining early, all the while promoting bitcoin on the premise that new coins are created fresh, not held by the founder, is a scheme.
If Satoshi ever reveals himself, I hope he's arrested and has his assets seized.
It would be good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-27 05:04:27
Yes. Yes I do. And Bitcoin meets the definition perfectly.
A useless products that can only turn a profit if you can find more suckers to buy it from you on the promise that they can find more suckers to buy it from them.
