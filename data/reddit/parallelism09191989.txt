Politicians lie.
One day they stand for bitcoin, the next day they don’t.
None of these presidents will stick their neck out on the line for bitcoin. Especially a Democrat or republican.
If you really want bitcoin to be successful, you may want to look into libertarian. Do your own politics research, but if you think red or blue will help you out, I got a bridge to sell you

You missed the point.
The point is, WB is apparently the worlds best investor and he’s anti crypto. The ad is mocking Buffet. It’s a rhetorical question. 
When BTC was $400 he went on live TV and cautioned the entire world to stay away from bitcoin. 
Also some correlation of the older generation being anti bitcoin and crypto people basically saying ‘old people will come around sooner rather than later.’

Good luck auditing 30,000,000 people over a few hundred or a few thousand gains.

Not off topic at all.
US markets will quake before an election and there will be heavy selling.
I assume OP is referring to big money using BTC as a hedge and economic safe haven from Trump.

Nothing much will change. Bitcoin is already easy to manipulate, this won’t make it much easier....

“Pretty easy”
The bulk of people use several different exchanges and the worlds most popular exchange is Binance which was Chinese and is now located in Malta. IRS needs to prove you didn’t receive a gift or somebody didn’t randomly send you crypto via off shore exchanges

Same... a lot of people don’t know how serious recessions are, and it’s a little depressing when I hear people say ‘THE NEXT RECESSION WILL BLOW 08 OUT THE WATER!”
It likely wont.... And yes, fiat and govt printing money has its issues, but I don’t think we see another 08 in our lifetime

This exact same thing happened to my World of Warcraft account I sold in 2009.
I sold it for $900 and the person literally sent me the PayPal money and it hit my account, so I gave them the account info.
2 days later PayPal took back the money that hit my account, so I had to retrieve my account back because I was scammed.
Unfortunately for you, you can’t retrieve the sent bitcoin..... 
I learned a good lesson in 2009, never trust random internet strangers, or assuming PayPal can’t take back the money

This is so fake.
Go to your local tech hub (uni or large company), get a lawyer, hand them the laptop and figure it out. A computer scientist will gladly do a days worth of work for a $10,000 cut of 1 million
