But no assets are risk-free. If the value of the asset collapses, then you have lost money and need to finance the debt. Even if it doesn't collapse and you are holding a rising asset, you still need to finance the debt. That's what the OP is taking care of. It's about risk mitigation.

Cool. Hadn't realized that about the LTCG exemption. I guess because my stocks are in IRAs and a 401k, so it doesn't really help me.
So is the $40k per year going up over time to adjust for inflation?
Also, I guess the one big downside is that you aren't contributing to Social Security, so you won't get it paid out (yes, assuming that SS still exists).
Edit: Ok, just did a quick read. I was thrown off by your literal "$40k/yr" when the actual withdrawal rate is indeed pegged to the COLA. However, unless I'm reading it wrong, the study was designed for you to deplete your assets in about 30 years, not keep the $1m principle "for the rest of your life." Also, you'd still be losing out on SS. Plus, the plan gets messed up if you need to tap the principle because of an unexpectedly large expense.

Govt spending as a percentage of GDP has been going down to historic levels.

Stiglitz is incredibly smart and about as accomplished an economist as there possibly can be. However, he has obviously not studied bitcoin, and he answered a vaguely worded question about it at a q&amp;a. He's obviously wrong about that part, but his other contention is more interesting: that currencies should be regulated.
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:15:01
As usual in these cases, what he said was a lot more nuanced. Nine years ago he said some positive things about Hugo Chavez's plan [to create a Southern Hemisphere regional development bank]( as a counterweight to the World Bank and US dominated Inter-American Development Bank. [He also said]( some positive things about the fact that Venezuela was spending a larger share of its GDP on programs to help the poor than previous governments had. 
That's a far cry from saying he "praised the Venezuelan economy before it collapsed." I mean, technically, 2007 is *before* the economy collapsed, but it's a long time before. And I can't find him saying anything positive about it since. And he didn't say "OMG Chavez is an economic genius and everyone should copy his economic plans!"
To dismiss Stiglitz is silly. He's one of the most accomplished economists in both academia and economic policy alive today. He obviously hasn't spent much time looking at bitcoin, but I'm sure that if he had praised it, everyone here would be proposing him for sainthood.
This forum doesn't do itself any favors in building legitimacy by trashing people and concepts it doesn't understand.

Obviously no commenters here have bothered to read the article. It's also interesting to think what the reaction would be if Stiglitz had come out enthusiastically *in favor* of bitcoin. I'm sure the headline would be *Fourth Ranking Economist and Nobel Laureate Praises Bitcoin!!!!!*
@_date: 2016-09-08 21:42:33
You are the one who brought up the charge of "extreme socialists". I was just asking you what you meant by it. Friedman and Hayek also won Nobel memorial prizes in economics, by the way. 
Are you saying that *any* government regulation or oversight of markets is a form of socialism? And that this didn't exist before the 1930s? Or that economists didn't support such things before the 1930s and then suddenly were taken over by some socialist cabal? (Did something happen in the late 1920s to make people change? I can't remember). How did Friedman and Hayek slip by? Were there ever free markets? If not, why are we so sure that they are better than what we have today?
@_date: 2016-09-08 19:42:38
You seem very ideologically confused. You don't like "hardcore socialism" (not sure how you're defining that -- a system that includes any kind of government regulation over the economy or currency?) but in another comment you say:


I thought only hardcore socialists were concerned about wealth inequality? And why are these hardcore socialists, which you seem to think includes every professional economist, so adamant in creating a system that rewards rich people?
And if, as you contend, the last several hundred years have been run by these hardcore socialists who hate markets, why are you so certain that markets, unfettered of any government interference or regulation, will lead to better outcomes?

Gold is not very versatile as currency anymore. Seems like the wrong thing for bitcoin to aspire to or compare itself to.
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:41:47

A fact is a fact. A tautology is a self-referential argument. 
People don't drive airplanes to work (fact -- well, unless you live in the bush in Alaska or something). There are many *reasons* for this (for example, most people don't live and work where there are runways, airplanes are expensive, airplanes are more difficult to operate than cars, you fly airplanes but drive cars, etc.). The *reason* people don't drive airplanes to work is *not* just because they don't do it.

He does not argue that Bitcoin is a safe asset. He says it has the potential to become one. But nowhere does he say that it currently is, or that it is certain to become one.
A store of value does not have to be 100% risk free (nothing in life is 100% risk free), but the farther away it is, the less it becomes a store of value.
I used US treasuries as an example. There are others in most other countries, especially the ones where people tend to have money to invest or save (or the access to technology and education to know how to use it currently necessary to use Bitcoin).
There are many reasons to think that Bitcoins are wonderful things, but it is not, currently, a good place to put your non-Bitcoin fiat money and have a reasonable expectation that, in a few years, it would have the same purchasing power that it does today.
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:28:12
Why would you want to use something that is so price-volatile as a "store of value"?
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:18:14
True, that's why you shouldn't consider the stock market as a place to put assets to store value. 
If you have US$10,000 that you need to put away for 1-3 years and be able to count on it being there at the end, you should put it in US Treasuries or a CD.
To put it in bitcoin, gold, the stock market, real estate or anything else is speculative. You might end up with a lot more, a lot less, or exactly the same as when you started. That is fine to do if you want to, but it is NOT storing value.
This is not a knock on bitcoin. Just saying don't pretend that it is something that it is not.
@_date: 2016-05-25 07:28:35
That doesn't necessarily make Bitcoin a good alternative.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:21:04
If people are putting money in gold as a store of value, they are doing it wrong. It is speculative and volatile. Putting money into US interest guaranteed treasury bills is putting it into a store of value.
I'm not saying don't *invest* or *speculate* with bitcoin if that's what you want to do. But it is not a good place to put money in that you can't afford to lose. That's the opposite of a store of value.

What if your brother gave you a copy of Dianetics? I'm not saying Bitcoin is like scientology, but I think that's how the family saw it.

Couldn't the creator of bitcoin devised a way to create more bitcoins for themselves outside of what others believe is possible?

Are you an expert in cryptography?

Well, with many things we rely on, there is at least some degree of accountability and recourse if things go terribly wrong.

That was sort of the feelings that I had that lead me to post my original question (however poorly phrased). I can't imagine that it's entirely irrelevant.

I'm a coding idiot, so excuse my stupidity, but isn't it generally true that any crypto routine will eventually be broken as computing power continues to grow (assume limitless resources, as we've seen with the NSA)? Isn't it possible that it is safe now, but could be vulnerable in a few years?

Until they don't.

Kind of makes you wonder if you should believe everything else they say.

How anonymous is practically anonymous? Is the greater anonymity of Bitcoin an attractive feature to most users?

I get that. But I'm not entirely clear how this is supposed to inspire confidence. It's a system kept in check to some significant degree by random people on the internet. Sounds like a fine thing for keeping wikipedia 90+% accurate, but when you're talking about an entire currency system, even 99.999% leaves room for malicious people to severely game the system. And (if that is his/her real username...) found an error in the protocol. What if it hadn't been found? Maybe it was insignificant. But what if there are other flaws that have not yet been found, yet could be exploited to some nefarious end before it is discovered?
Then you have the fact that the entire thing was created by an unknown entity (who could just as easily be the NSA, an evil mastermind, or a benevolent genius teenager), who is known to control more than 1/20th of the entire possible quantity of this new currency.
It involves an amazing amount of trust. Perhaps it is the perfect, uncorruptible self regulating system. But that would be a first in this world, as far as I'm aware of. I'm not saying it isn't true, but I'm just struck by the degree of absolute faith in this incredible turn of events, and I personally don't have the tools to evaluate it.

Did they teach you not to generalize?

What if Bitcoin were created by the NSA? Would you still use it?
