When mainstream predict these kind of insane rises, you know it's time to sell. Wait until they're dismissing bitcoin as dead and buried to rebuy (at $1k probably). 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:02:40
When tether implodes it's going to bring bitcoin crashing down. The only thing keeping bitcoin afloat at these prices is tether printing infinite digital dollars which they are using to buy bitcoin. This is going to get ugly.

Firstly, which such escrow service do you refer to? Are there any in operation? How do you know they will act fairly and not scam you? 
Secondly, you still need to trust the escrow service, which are a third party. How is this any different to trusting a Bank or PayPal, for example?

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:05:44
Best strategy right now is sell, wait for this to settle out at about $4k or $5k in a few months and then buy back in. No point trying to catch a falling knife like this.

If you're wanting to buy more than £2500 worth then use Coinfloor.co.uk - they have pounds sterling deposits, so no exchange rate fees. 
If you just want to buy smaller amounts, try LocalBitcoins - be sure to do a smaller purchase first so you get familiar with the process and only buy from trusted traders with good feedback. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:42:36
If you want to cut losses or still have some profit in the game, take it now. You have been warned, folks. 
When tether implodes, bitcoin will probably settle at $1k. And it will take years to recover.

You think it's gonna drop more?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:29:28
Bitfinex own Tether Ltd through their parent company. Tether Ltd can print as many tether as they want and often do so. Usually in 100,000,000 batches which are then sent to Bitfinex exchange wallet. So to make this clear Bitfinex are printing 100 million tether at zero cost and sending them to themselves. They then use these tether tokens to buy bitcoin on their exchange. If they can create infinite tether dollars and send them to themselves to buy bitcoin, then they are creating artificial buy pressure in the market. 
Some people also speculate that they are also then reselling these bitcoins for real dollars on another USD exchange. If this is the case, then it's even worse, because all of the real money is being extracted from the bitcoin economy and being replaced with tether tokens. This will lead to the exchanges becoming insolvent, tether crashing and a run on the exchanges as everyone scrambles to get the last remaining fiat out of the system. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:08:55
Risky. Tether could collapse and become worthless. Better to get your bitcoin to a real US dollar exchange.

For the price to go up it requires new $$$ coming in. All the normies just witnessed the bitcoin price get obliterated over night. They will be VERY cautious about investing anything now.

It's fine to cash out but I would recommend keeping a small amount of bitcoin. Depending on how much you have etc. Never sell ALL of it. People have regretted doing so.

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:22:28
You're right. People are losing money and should be cutting losses or taking profit instead of holding. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:09:28
So sell now, rebuy at $2k. Then wait 5 years. Better than holding since you can rebuy more coins cheaper.

Tethers represent over $2 Billion of fake dollars spent in the bitcoin ecosystem. Total fiat spent in the bitcoin market is estimated to be $10 Billion. Therefore tether represents 20% of the money invested into bitcoin.

It's crashing. We entered a bear market. It peaked and it couldn't maintain the price. In 2014 price dropped from gold parity of $1200 to about $200.
I didn't want to believe it, but I've seen this before. I held as long as I could but I'll rebuy at 3k (or whatever) just as I rebought in 2014.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:23:18
When you buy and sell, you're trading at a specific price point.
You believe this price to be reflective of current demand for Bitcoin (and a function of the current supply: but it's mostly about demand, because the actual supply can't fluctuate, and the "selling" supply is really still just about demand)
The current price has, you assume, been real and organic, so you're happy to base your current decisions on that.
Then, all of a sudden, you find out that over $2 billion worth of that demand was actually fake, and that the "real" demand is significantly lower. Would you still buy at the current price, or would you think **"Hang on, if a bunch of the demand was fake, then the real price is lower"** and instead see the current price as too high?
And then when a bunch of people realize this, the price tanks. When the price tanks, other people panic. As they watch the price drop, some people assume the demand was even more fake than it actually was, and the panic continues into a full scale crash.

Yeah and Professor Bitcorn predicted in 2013 that bitcoin would fall to $10. Instead it went to $20,000. These so called professional analysts know nothing.

@_date: 2018-01-17 20:03:56
Yes I bought in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Sold a few weeks ago at 16k. That profit can be used for something useful or I can just rebuy wherever this thing ends up at. Probably 5k or less. That means I can triple my stash for the same money or buy the same amount of coins for a third of the $. Hodl is a terrible strategy. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:43:51
It will go down but it cannot be accurately predicted to a particular month since it's manipulated in favour of the big players. Therefore it's better to simply wait and buy back at the appropriate time.

Edit: I was wrong!
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:52:32

@_date: 2018-01-16 10:17:40
I sold some at 16k, some at 14k and some at 12k. It's in a downward spiral, friend. It's a repeat of 2013/14 crash when it went from $1200 to $200. So I do think it will be heading down to about $5k. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:52:36

It's not going back up for a while. It's a got a ways to fall yet. This crash will damage the public perception of bitcoin. Nobody is going to touch this for a long time. With no new buyers, the price can only drop. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:09:19
I'm only guessing based on the fact that BTC is probably more distributed than it was in 2013. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:11:24
Yeah, HODL is stupid, as I have to come to realise. The only people that want you to HODL are whales that want to dump a lot at the best price possible. So they need a slow decline with bull traps which convince people to stay on board so they can just dump more at a higher price. This has been happening for 3 weeks now. If you hold, you're just allowing whales to sell at a higher price. They are getting rich while you HODL when you should have SODL two weeks ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:02:46
It says in the article that it's certified untampered with. These coins have have tamper-proof seals so that if it had been opened, you would know and not go through with the purchase.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:51:53
Maybe not. I think it's going under 10k. In fact big market players are saying 8k or even 7k. And if it falls that low it could go to 5k. This ain't over.

In addition:

Going to 5k or less
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:54:36
People are losing money. Just trying to help. Why is it ok to scream HODL which is a bad strategy in a falling market? HODL works in a climbing market I agree and benefitted from it. But the last 3 week were not the time to HODL. As proven by the chart.

Hey man, I'm the same. I got into bitcoin years ago to get away from scammy fiat banking and fractional reserve. 
To find out that this obvious fraud and deception found its way into bitcoin was very disappointing. Like you, I'll be back when it's purged and all of the artificial inflationary effects on the price have been removed. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:25:01
People said the same thing in 2013 when bitcoin first hit gold/oz parity ($1200). Bitcoin is maxed out they said!!! And 4 years later bitcoin is $20k.... it's cyclical and I don't doubt bitcoin will go to even greater heights in the future.

Tether are making the claim that they are backed by dollars 1:1. They have provided no proof, no audit and no evidence of such.

@_date: 2018-01-29 10:53:42
Tether has been artificially inflating bitcoin price. And more recently propping it up at the 11k level. If you remove the buys from fake tether dollars, then the real demand for bitcoin is much lower. That means the price has to go down. 
Also take into account that replacement of real dollars in the ecosystem with fake dollars, has resulted in the bitcoin ecosystem becoming largely insolvent, and you realise that very few people can actually get their cash back out of the system. When people realise this, there will be a stampede as everyone rushes to leave a sinking ship.

Whatever their original intention, they have dug themselves into an ever deeper hole now. In order to back the tethers they have issued, they need to maintain btc at a certain price right? But they can only maintain btc's price by printing more tether and buying more btc. Which means they need btc to go up more and the cycle continues.
They are now trapped in a death spiral which they probably did not intend to get stuck into, but now have no choice to try and maintain a facade of legitimacy or it's going down in flames anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:00:44
So if the person isn't buying it for the physical intact coin, they could just go buy a random 1 btc off an exchange for half the price. Like it or not, it's the physicality and novelty of the item that gives it the value.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:33:42
How do you know? Are you some kind of psychic? Maybe people that mined hundreds of bitcoin years ago that never signed up to an exchange. Or people that bought on localbitcoins years ago but don't want to sell on there because it's easy to get scammed. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:46:33
Why? Because they are making millions, maybe billions of dollars. If tether fails, they can just claim that it was due to market forces or due to negligence. Regardless of whether they are guilty of intentional fraud or not, it will be hard to prove. In any case, they aren't doing anything "wrong" per se. They are creating a token and selling it for $1. If people buy their product, then so be it, they will argue. The problem is that they claim every tether to be backed by $1, which it mostly likely is not. But again hard to prove and depends on the semantics that they would argue. They would probably say that once sold, a tether is backed by one dollars worth of bitcoin, but this is a misleading interpretation of their claim.
But as to why? Money. It's always about money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:22:56
Remember people are selling now because they want to buy back cheaper 3 months from now or 6 months. Whatever. Sell now for $11k and rebuy at $5k in 3 months. It's a no brainer. HODL makes no sense in a crashing market because you will be able to buy cheaper in the future.

Mining breakeven per btc is apparently 1500 or so. So that would be a kind of minimum. If it drops below that, some miners would need to either pull the plug or sell more coins to pay the bills. If they hold a stash and sell it, you know what happens to the price, right? If they pullout of mining, then the hash rate goes down which means blocks will get mined slower until difficulty adjusts.

The Dec 2013 boom was followed by a 12 month slow decline where bitcoin fell from 1200 to 200.

There are mainly 3 things happening right now. Or 3 categories, if you like:
* Enthusiasts that bought years ago very cheaply that became very rich, very quickly. Many are locking in some or all of those profits. No point holding when you can sell now and buy back in cheaper in the future
* Miners who have bills to pay now and in the future. If they see a downward trend, again sell now and secure X months worth of electricity bills
* New investors that bought between 15k and 20k. These people will now be panicking as they were casual investors (not enthusiasts that understood or got the tech). They are likely to bail and never come back to bitcoin after being burned hard
All of these in combination are  obliterating the markets right now. Also bitcoin is cyclical. This happened in 2013/2014. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:56:00

Great summary. I'm saving this. Won't this eventually lead to the entire crypto ecosystem becoming insolvent?

It's just a matter of when...

Bitcoin goes through boom/bust cycles. Typically followed by a long period of stagnation or sideways movement. I feel like we're at the start of decline period. Could be wrong of course. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:30:57
Yes, if you sell now, you can buy more back later for less. Then wait til it goes back up. Note there was a 3 year stagnation period between 2014 and the 2017 boom. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:00:04
When you buy and sell, you're trading at a specific price point.
You believe this price to be reflective of current demand for Bitcoin (and a function of the current supply: but it's mostly about demand, because the actual supply can't fluctuate, and the "selling" supply is really still just about demand)
The current price has, you assume, been real and organic, so you're happy to base your current decisions on that.
Then, all of a sudden, you find out that over $2 billion worth of that demand was actually fake, and that the "real" demand is significantly lower. Would you still buy at the current price, or would you think **"Hang on, if a bunch of the demand was fake, then the real price is lower"** and instead see the current price as too high?
And then when a bunch of people realize this, the price tanks. When the price tanks, other people panic. As they watch the price drop, some people assume the demand was even more fake than it actually was, and the panic continues into a full scale crash.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:10:48
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:59:59
Why would you move it? You'd have to destroy the coin and it's associated value, to do so. It's the fact that it's a mint unmoved bitcoin that gives it it's $28,000 premium price. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:26:05
If you can rebuy cheaper later, then yes of course. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:26:21
2014 wants a word ...
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:17:51

You just proved that you do not understand how market cap works. A $600 Billion market cap doesn't mean that $600 Billion has been invested into crypto.

Bitcoin needs to attain a market value equivalent to a fiat currency before it can behave as one. To give you an idea of that, total $ M2 money supply is over $13.5 Trillion. Bitcion marketcap is $275 billion. Lots of potential growing room for bitcoin there.

Are you stupid, sorry? If you bought property of any kind in the 70's or 80's you made hundreds of thousands or millions if you were smart enough. Ask any property tycoon.

Someone sells a promise to sell bitcoin at some determined time in the future at a certain price. The person selling this promise (contract) doesn't actually hold any bitcoin. If the price is lower at the future date the seller makes money. If the price is higher at the future date the seller loses money. 
Basically the stock market figured out a way to make money even when the asset being traded is losing value. 
In theory though the shorter can also buy actual bitcoin now at today's price to hedge the short if the value does in fact rise. Because bitcoin is a finite commodity, this hedge will naturally in fact drive the price upwards anyway. 
In other words, nobody knows what's going to happen!

A crash like this is the exact opposite of when it's gaining thousands per day. 
Nobody wants to sell an appreciating asset. And nobody wants to hold a depreciating asset. Once the crash starts, it's hard to contain. Combine with Xmas and it's going to be 2013 all over again. Expect it to settle at 5k maybe. But seriously, who knows....

I'll admit to not knowing all the details about how the future markets work. But why would someone shorting bitcoin then buy bitcoin?

A Ponzi scheme like Property and Gold?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:21:55
Is property a pyramid? Could buy a big House in the 1970's for a cool few k's. Now a property is hundreds of thousands. Wow, sounds like a pyramid scheme. What about gold price in the 70's Vs Now? Sounds like a pyramid?  In reality, the reason things go up is because fiat currency is constantly losing value (inflation). When an asset like bitcoin is super deflationary, it's price will rise Vs inflationary fiat.
In the same way that property and gold have also increased over time. In essence, it isn't that anything of this nature is a pyramid, it's simply that fiat currency is not a good store of value.

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:41:55
Weak theory IMO. Let me tell you why:
Ultimately where do the profits from bitcoin mining end up? Paying the miner's electricity bill. Running the bitcoin network consumes more electricity than entire nations, including New Zealand, Serbia and Ireland. Annual bitcoin electricity usage is now over 32 TerraWatt hours. Bitcoin electricity consumption will overtake the U.S. by July 2019 and the world by 2020
I think it's therefore obvious that bitcoin was invented by the Energy companies to increase global electricity usage and keep energy demand and prices high. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:45:32

To use bcash, you had to download a separate wallet/client or enable the feature in your existing wallet. Then you had to claim it by sweeping your bitcoin private key. The original bitcoin is the one that already existed in your wallet without having to do anything.

Trustless borderless peer-to-peer transfer of wealth has value, in its own right. The "intrinsic" value is in the network and the hardware that secures bitcoin. Value is whatever people deem it to be. And people clearly value bitcoin just as some people value gold or any other commodity.
Believe me, I struggled understanding this to begin with as well. Like older folks I've spoken to, they simply cannot grasp WHY it has value. But like anything, it has value because many people agree it does. It's as simple as that.

Bcrash is crashing. And Bitcoin is heading up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:59:00
IMO someone is preventing the price rising above $17,250.
It's manipulation. And they don't want it going up. A sell wall of this size will prevent it going up or at least slow down growth for several days, as we have seen all week.

Bitcoin was fine from 2009 to 2015 before the phoney NN bill came into place. Also, most miners are in Asia or Nordics etc. They aren't on American soil, so an American bill has absolutely less than zero impact on most miners.

Bitcoin has come a long way. 
And it's just the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:15:14
Haha right there with you. I'm a believer. Because this is the third time I've witnessed this pattern materialize. I also have my concerns. But not about bitcoin itself. Only about governments making exchanges illegal or banks refusing to accept transfers from exchanges thus making it impossible for people to cash out. Either, would obviously have a big affect on bitcoin. But Futures legitimize bitcoin as an asset class. It will be a lot harder to make it illegal now (IMO).  
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:12:14
Bitcoin needs to attain a market value equivalent to a fiat currency before it can behave as one. To give you an idea of that, total USD M2 money supply is over $13.5 Trillion. Bitcion marketcap is $275 billion. Lots of potential growing room for bitcoin there.

Think of bitcoin like gold bars. It's scarce, holds value very well, can be stored securely and appreciates in worth. 
However gold is relatively slow and expensive to move around. Therefore just HODL.

That said, I do think they have been acquiring. They need a position first. I think they are going to long it first, keep acquiring. Make money on the long. Then short it and dump. This way they make money in 4 places, rather than just 2. If anything, Wall Street is greedy and this is their best strategy.

If you want to buy some bitcoin, I wouldn't put in $10k all at once. Start with $1k and learn how it works. Learn how to store it securely. Once you've played a bit and you like it, invest more as you see fit. Perhaps $1k per fortnight or month etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:30:18
It's not fake but it was artificially inflated due to lack of coins on the exchange I would presume.

If you want to keep your bitcoin investment, just keep the bitcoin. Why would you sell only to rebuy? That doesn't make any sense.

Tether pumped the price and then it propped it up for a while. But the game is up and the price is unsustainable. It will continue to drop.

lol more like 7k
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:40:17
When you buy and sell, you're trading at a specific price point.
You believe this price to be reflective of current demand for Bitcoin (and a function of the current supply: but it's mostly about demand, because the actual supply can't fluctuate, and the "selling" supply is really still just about demand)
The current price has, you assume, been real and organic, so you're happy to base your current decisions on that.
Then, all of a sudden, you find out that over $2 billion worth of that demand was actually fake, and that the "real" demand is significantly lower. Would you still buy at the current price, or would you think **"Hang on, if a bunch of the demand was fake, then the real price is lower"** and instead see the current price as too high?
And then when a bunch of people realize this, the price tanks. When the price tanks, other people panic. As they watch the price drop, some people assume the demand was even more fake than it actually was, and the panic continues into a full scale crash.

@_date: 2018-02-04 10:45:04
In simplest terms: Because there is no new money coming in to sustain this price point.
There is $18m of bitcoin mined per day which means if there is less than $18m of fiat entering the system, the price has to go down.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:42

Will you still be sat here in 6 months when bitcoin is 3k thinking to yourself "I should have sold at 8k" ...?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:37:46
The difference is that USD is backed by the biggest economy in the world and is legal tender. You can buy anything with it and you can pay taxes with it. People legitimately earn dollars by working for a living (well most).
Tether is printed by 3 shady folks in the Cayman Islands. In fact nobody really knows who owns tether. They print tether out of thin air at zero cost. And somehow you're saying that you should trust tether equally as you trust USD? Completely irrational because tether isn't legal tender, isn't accepted anywhere and you can't pay taxes with it. It's literally monopoly money. But let's all pretend they are just like dollars. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:50:38
It's an issue because the bitcoin was artificially inflated far beyond the price through normal demand. If 20% of the fiat in the bitcoin economy is counterfeit, then it means that the price has been increased via 2 Billion of fake dollars.
They also took 20% of the dollars out of the system and replaced them with fake dollars. This means that not everyone can take out their dollars anymore, ie: the crypto economy is insolvent. This is why the massive crash and price drop happened. Not enough real money to sustain the price. And that's why it will keep dropping. 
To say it isn't a problem is very short sighted. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:30:00
Bitcoin does follow predictable patterns though. Particularly crash patterns. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:44:36
2k is the low (10% of 20k high) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:52:10
Why did you not sell at 20k and take the profit? If you never take profit, what's the point? Just curious. Are you going to hold all the way back down again? Better to sell, take profits and rebuy lower.

It's better to sell now, not buy. Why would you buy today when it's always cheaper tomorrow. And the day after...
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:09:11
It's about making profit when you can. For anyone that got in early, if they were smart they sold in the 15k to 20k range. If they didn't, they can still sell now for huge profits, and they should do so. 
They can still buy back later for cheaper. You gotta go with the motion. Buy on the way up and sell as soon as you can in a downturn. This down trend is honestly just the start. I see it going to 2k but as you said, if complete despair kicks in, it could go sub-1000. 
The hodl meme is honestly stupid and people losing all their profits out of some kind of notion of a noble act in going down with the ship, is foolish. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:00:17
Big drop expected tomorrow and Tuesday. Plan accordingly
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:16:43
Because bitcoin just lost over 60% of its value. It could drop further to lose 80% of its value. Do you think there will be many new investors coming in to an asset that can lose 60% in a month? It was already too volatile for normal folks. And January just proved all the naysayers right. The "I told you so" will be strong. And normal people will be put off. 
If there's no new money coming in, then the price drops. Simple economics.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:51:31
There are no hodlers
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:48:22
But if you sell now at 9k, you can buy back 3x as many bitcoins for the same amount of dollars. It's just makes sense.

@_date: 2018-02-04 10:57:42
You have to understand the game. Whales and/or miners need to dump a lot of coins. They can make money in market crashes, probably more reliably than in booms. A lot of whales bought everyone's coins at 7500. Stopped selling their own coins which pushed the price to 9400 yesterday. They then slowly offloaded all those coins in a bulltrap for nearly 2k profit per coin. They also temporarily boosted the price to sell their own coins. 
These folks have millions to play with and they totally manipulated the market. If they want the price down (and they do) then the price will go down.

But you're predicting that the 2018 crash after a Dec peak, is over after 1 month? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:28:01
Yes, it's going to 2k (10% of 20k).
Just like in 2013/2014 it fell from $1300 to $160 (approx, 10% too, I forget the exact numbers). 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:38:29
Yes, it's better to sell and buy back cheaper. Then you acquire more coins for the same dollar amount. Buy back price estimate is approx 2k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:49:37
Good choice, it's certainly going lower.

Tethers represent over $2 Billion of fake dollars spent in the bitcoin ecosystem. Total fiat spent in the bitcoin market is estimated to be $8 Billion. Therefore tether represents 20% of the money invested into bitcoin.
People that use the market cap argument only prove that they know very little about economics.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:35:42
Maybe by 2022.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:50:52
It isn't bouncing back. This isn't a dip. It's a crash. See 2014-2015 chart for more info. $900 to $180 over 12 month period. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:10:01
Another classic bulltrap. And everyone falls for it EVERY time. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:15:40
No more greater fools. Anyone left hodling is officially a bag holder. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:55:25
2k will be capitulation. Despair and blood in the streets at 1k. That's the buy signal.

* China bans crypto trading and ICO's.
* India heavily regulating. Potential ban in future
* USA and UK banks are banning crypto purchases with credit cards
* America SEC regulation meeting tomorrow. Potential ICO ban or worse. 
* Tether scam and potential fraud artificially pumping the bitcoin price. Many people now realising that the current price is unsustainable.
Therefore price going down is a lot more likely than going up, right now.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:28:01
Yes, wait a while. It will be cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:57:42
Yes, bitfinex are taking everyone's funds right now... You seem out of touch of reality. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:11:47
Sell while you're still in profit!
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:51:15
Oh no my stocks lost 1% of their value. Better sell them and buy an asset that lost 65% in two weeks. Said no-one ever. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:29:49
So you accept that bitcoin is a pump and dump... And that we are clearly in the dump phase right now and have been since the end of December. Seems like you know how this works but are refusing to accept the eventual outcome of where the price is heading. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:50:49
If you had sold at 18k, you'd have doubled your bitcoin holdings by now by rebuying a 50% drop.
 If you sell now, you can still double your holdings by rebuying at 4.5k. Or triple your holdings by rebuying at 3k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:36:06
Just sell and buy back at 4k or 2k. 
Time to wake up and realize that you shoulda SODL at 18k 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:18:35
The reason for highlighting this is because in previous boom-crash cycles, bitcoin quite often crashes to 10% of its previous high.
Sorry if that wasn't obvious. It will be to anyone who was around since 2011 or earlier.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:15:00
It feels exactly like the peak of December 2013 and the great crash of 2014. Followed by 2 years of sideways stagnation. 
* Dec 2013 = $1300
* Mar 2015 = $180
If the same pattern occurs, bitcoin should fall to 10% of its 20k high. So about 2k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:39:28
Yeah they cashed out all the way from 20k to 2k while you held that bag for them
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:11
Taking profit is FUD? lol

They better sell while they're still green then. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:11:28
Take profit while you've still got some. 
Just a note, you're not supposed to buy at 7k, hold all the way to 20k and hold it all the way back down to 7k again. Because literally what was the point?
You're supposed to buy at 7k. Sell at 20k. Rebuy at 7k or whatever the eventual low is (personally I think it's going to 2k). 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:19:08
And unsurprisingly, the tether printing press has stopped and what is bitcoin doing? Crashing exactly as predicted by the above. Without tether to pump and/or prop up the price, bitcoin will return to 2016 levels. There is simply no new money coming in to sustain these price levels.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:49:10
5k by March
2k end of year
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:27:49
About 2 Billion tether should do it...
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:37:09
5k by March. 
2k by end of year. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:35:37
Exactly, it's the only sound strategy in a bear market like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:09:34
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:46
Too risky
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:49:27
Yeah, see you at 7k
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:37:10
Because they bought bitcoin with funny money which cost nothing and sold bitcoin for real dollars. It means they got dollars for nothing. That's the scam. Congratulations
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:39:43
It is gambling. Or mass delusion. Getting out with profits is always wise. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:11:18
It's not a pyramid folks. It's a reverse funnel!
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:42
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:37:34
Everyone is selling. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:29:40
In 5 years maybe. Or maybe it won't? It's definitely going down before it goes up. Sell now. Buy more cheaper. ???. Profit. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:23:34
Because if it goes to 2k for 4 years before it recovers, you're better off selling now and buying back at the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:42:41
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:47:33
5k by March

Your choice?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:47:08
5k by March
2k end of year
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:31:52
Bitfinex are doing exactly the same right now: 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:40:19
Sell sell sell. Going to 3k or lower 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:42:30
No, but it's looking more and more likely. One month ago nobody would have believed it would be at 7900
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:51:52
Because the price is going down? lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:13:46
5k by March

5k by March
2k end of year
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:36:19
2k here we come
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:10:46
If it's crashing only idiots hold. Sell and buy back cheaper. You'll increase your stash. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:25:57
Expect 5k short term, then slow bleed out to 2k by early 2019. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:40:09
5k by March
2k end of year 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:43:05
Except for this rally and crash:
* Dec 2013 = $1200
* Mar 2015 = $170
Bitcoin didn't get back to $1000 until January 2017. It was a 3 year stagnation period.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:38:51
Will be 2k by end of year. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:11
Absolutely. And everyone now realized that bitcoin is not worth the artificially inflated prices. It's worth much much less. And it will correct down to pre-tether-pump prices (1k). 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:46:50
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:31
2025 :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:45:52
More like 2k
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:26
Just whales making money on the way down. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:54
Bull trap
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:59:15
2k is zero now? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:43:51
Not buying until 2k
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:51:08
