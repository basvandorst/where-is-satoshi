couldn't the same thing be said for the entire field of public key cryptography, besides a few techniques like DH?
i would assume the solution is the same; make a wrapper that is easy to use for end user. example: encrypt keys with salted password, require password for use. also tie in two factor through a phone app? 
just talking out of my ass.
