Under current code I dare you to not pay your property taxes (if you even own a home)

I haven’t studied much on Chinese real estate laws so I can’t tell you much on that. However, the US local governments will look at you as owing them money and will not compensate you at all from the public auction.

It’s funny how people downvote your comments when you speak truly about the current state of our laws. Really dangerous for our society imho

I’m not involved with any ground leases. Any lessor of land (owner of ground lease) who doesn’t pays their property taxes to the local municipality will have their property tax foreclosed and the municipality will auction the real estate to the highest bidder.

You’re referring to eminent domain. That’s the only time you will be compensated by the government. However, if you don’t pay property taxes and fail to do so before the public auction Your house WILL be sold and you will not be compensated.

Unfortunately, it’s the same way in the states.

Ledger are years ahead of you in development and have just released the ledger nano x.
Why would I store my assets on a start up in Hong Kong over the ledger? I wouldn’t....

Do you understand why Ledger developed the Nano x or are you not aware? 
They have a new generation of Nano for consumers to make payments to brick and mortar vendors, etc through their new app they launched in 2019 that connects the Nano X to their app for payment verifications.
