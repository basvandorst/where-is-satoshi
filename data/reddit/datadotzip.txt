Yeah it's a bit of a canondrum. We'll publish the results, and it's for a safer, stronger Bitcoin community. So I hope people are willing to do the right thing, and get this a bit of attention.

I hope some of you are interested in this \(and the 750$ USD BTC reward\), the rule is to leave a comment and upvote if you participate, otherwise this would never get any attention, and I really need this data for my masters. I don't think that many people will participate \(50 at most, so your chances are quite good\).

You never know, you might anyways. \&lt;3
Thank you so much.

Thank you so much.  It really means a lot, it's for my masters degree so I hope at least some are willing to participate.

That would really be helpful man. Ideally like 5\-10 for each major exchange site. If you can actually make that happen, we can talk some compensation. Thank you so much, glad there are kind souls on the Internet.

Here's a screenshot of the current metrics: [
Also, as to how the data is being used, it's completely transparent, as will be shown in the report, and not attempt will be made to link any identity or person to any transaction. We simply want to investigate if all of the exchanges are really living up to their "best practices" of storing users funds through blockchain analysis. With a little help of neural networks, and some insider info of how that process goes on, we think we have a pretty good shot if we can get some valid data. :\)

New rule: If you upvote, participate, and leave a comment stating you participated, your name is added twice. I guess that incentivizes people to upvote, and thus gives me more data to work with for the good of Bitcoin. It's a win for everyone.

The giveaway ends in 72 hours by the way. But not many have entered \- so there's a good chance anyone who does wins.

You're a saint. &lt;3 Feel free to DM me if you have any success.

Thanks for the suggestion. Looks like an easier way to do it. Do you know if there exists a similar solution for Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:28:25
Thanks for your reply. I need to keep track of the balances of newly generated coin addresses, and therefore I don't think it's necessary to keep track of old transactions (please correct me if it is). Would there be any security implications to not storing old transactions?

I have a site that rewards people in BTC. They have an account with a wallet generated by me. I need to keep track of the money sent to that account by the exchange we use. I'd like to do it using no APIs.
