it's not very exciting, i found the PC but no wallet.dat file anywhere in the mentioned directories. I could try the above mentioned method to try and recover a wallet.dat file using a hard disk recovery method. but i know i don't think i had more than a single bitcoin if that. so i not going to get around to recovering any data this weekend.

I don't understand because Bitcoin isn't illegal, i know this subreddit is pro-bitcoin and there is a slight aura of anti-establishment here. But what's the underlying story behind these men going to jail? I guess I could research it myself but i'm not really that motivated.

i'm sure they "parallel constructed" the shit out of evidence, but that's not really the point i'm trying to make. You can be a 16 year old and claim you don't know you're supposed to stop on red at a right turn, but you're still going to get a traffic ticket. 
Ross was a part of an underground drug empire in over his head or not. He's making the FBI and DEA look like their failing the war on drugs. They're going to come at him with everything they can to win the case. 
They have to win to keep the war on drugs going. It's more of a personal vendetta... it has nothing to do with a conspiracy to trash bitcoins. if the war was against bitcoin, we certainly wouldn't even have a Ross trial to begin with because there would never have been a market in the first place.
