Theyre completely different because currently when I walk up to Best Buy with cash in hand, they don't have to convert it. That changes when you start accepting a different currency. By your logic, an US company in Europe immediately exchanges their euros for dollars as soon as they're earned rather than waiting for the opportune moment.

amazing how ease of use can be argued one way but not defended.

I've grown up speaking both english and spanish. It's far more than just language, believe it or not. You can walk into any grocery store and send money to your family elsewhere literally in the same transaction as you're buying groceries. How would you explain the extra steps to them and how the extra time is worthwhile?

not to say you shouldnt worry about them, but they should still be acknowledged. The first actual point that I saw made by the pro bitcoin side on that tweet was 'Of course cash is king. However, if you need to get cash to someone 3,000 miles away on a holiday or after bank hours, then what?'
Western Union can be done at Walmart and I don't even need to find my pants unless my phone is in the pocket to send via pay pal. There are so many ways to wire money that it really hurts the argument when you're trying to convince someone of something groundbreaking by using selling points that already exist.

which would only matter enough to dig into under a criminal investigation. it's a little less annoying in that case to simply confiscate someone's computer/laptop than digging through hours and hours of multiple camera angles to find the 1 consumer in thousands and then tie them to a data base that they're probably not in. anonymous as long as nobody can get into your computer.

then why is this not marketed. Instead I see Nascar and bitcoin atm's like im going to transfer cash to bitcoin to pay for a taco at the counter 15 feet away.

there are laws against money laundering, so yes he broke at least one. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:22:51
if even 2 of you guys sent threats to her, your point is diminished. It's a sterotyping comment, but if you write an article and people that put THEMSELVES into that stereotype threaten you, dont expect to not be exposed further as a bunch of prepubescent acting wanna be finance gurus. 
TL;DR You cant claim someones stereotyping if theyve legitimately received any sort of threat. The world was interested to know, if the creator had acted differently..you all would have as well.

that's step two after acquiring ill gotten money when charged with money laundering.

When you buy gas, do you use bitcoin?

If I pay cash in any store or sell anything on craigslist, it's done anonymously.

i'd be willing to bet more 'butters' could spell western union than there are places you can use bitcoin.

laundering drug funds is a crime. i dont know how you don't realize that.

if he's saying justice is served rather than still pleading innocence, it might say something about the fact that he's acknowledged the fact he did something illegal and didn't get the full forearm of the law fisted into him. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:04:33
I dont get your point at all. youre ignoring the fact that what he did was illegal and keep bringing up morality as if laundering drug money is comparable to racial segregation. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:01:41
no, it would have put him into the next step where he goes before a judge. had he not had some idea that he was guilty, there was a chance to get nothing. considering how much he was spending on attorneys, I doubt that was the case considering the outcome.
has everybody forgotten how anything works because it involves bitcoin? I've read that the fed is counterfeiting money (they're the only ones that are even allowed to print money without it being considered counterfeit), that laundering money isn't illegal it's immoral and this, where when you get accused of a crime you either take the plea because your innocent or serve the full time as if there wasn't a very exact paper trail detailing the crime and those involved and innocent outcomes don't exist. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:46:01
I didnt recieve them. Do you see how youre acting? That's what she's talking about. Dont get butt hurt where you shouldn't if you shouldn't.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:53:22
exactly, so why's it a shock that this guy is charged for not reporting that million dollars?
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:23:55
But that's only considering if the market rate has risen. Do you really think Best Buy would take a loss on your bitcoin transaction if it happened to bottom out? They're looking at it. That means its far from being enacted when it comes to a corporate level.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:47:33
These news anchor reported this and recieved what she got. Do you think she'll be willing to expose somebody that's ACTUALLY got the power to do something now?
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:41:03
then where's the switch for bitcoin? I can go anywhere and get/spend cash. How would you convince a migrant worker to go past a system that's been in use for decades and so much simpler than this? 
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:20:47
No, it means the consumer pays them unwittingly.

The scanners can't really do more than bit coin, they just scan. Whether the database query is in USD or bitcoin, 99% sure those scanners just give you a price and a debit to the store's inventory.
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:35:34
what? the fed would have a hard time counterfeiting money considering they're the only agency allowed to print bill notes. It's counterfeiting for literally anyone else to do it. 
edit:I like how im downvoted for pointing out that the fed is where money is printed, therefore it's not 'counterfeit'. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:52:56
no, you are.
you should read up on what you consider immoral vs illegal. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 02:39:14
right here, in case you forgot where you told me im confusing immorality with illegality. i told you flat out that laundering money is a crime.

A QR code is just a link. A QR code to a direct-in-store purchase isnt unfeasible. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:57:58
That's why buying and selling exchange rates are different.
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:42:20
Flat out, this currency or any other e-currency will never take off when new ones are popping up. Doge coin? Sure, whatever...I mean Mickey Mouse dollars have a value somewhere...

You can't claim bitcoin is covered under cash policy when it's a new monetary denomination. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:45:02
Fish sticks make a great analogy for ease of use actually. Nobody actually likes fish sticks, they're just easy to buy, make and keep on hand...sort of like cash. 
If in order to eat fish sticks, I had to either purchase them online or fish for them myself online, then store them in a virtual freezer that I could only access after a handful of passwords and I'd only be able to eat them in certain places where I would normally never eat them...they're no longer easy to eat.
 It's a hassle for something that could be done simply in a way that it's already being done. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:13:36
nor do I see bitcoin seducing the market to abandon current currencies much. Call me a shill or whatever, but the same people I see actually buying into bitcoin and dogecoins are the same people that are either on WakeUpNow or being recruited by them.

the law of moses isn't the law of the judicial system. that's like trying to use apple hot keys on a pc and not understanding why they dont work. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 02:38:18
then why did you say im confusing morality with illegality when I said that laundering drug funds is a crime? my very first comment to you is that laundering drug funds is a crime and i showed a source that you didnt find any mention of morality in. what the shit? 
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:31:36
what if the teller knowingly takes a million dollars from a known drug dealer? I think you're stretching the situation a little. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:20:04
Okay, so rather than disagreeing and saying its completely wrong why don't you refute it? 
Edit: From the article you posted "Google Wallet will continue to exist, but will integrate Android Pay as a payment source."
I don't see how you can say it has nothing to do with google wallet. If your wallet can suddenly fit pesos, euros and yens along with your dollar bills, would that mean that your wallet no longer has anything to do with buying a mcdouble with coins that re in your pocket? What if your wallet could exchange euros into the 1.25 you'd need for that mcdouble, because that's literally what I just read this will do with the only exception being that you inserted bitcoin into the scenario.

I can swipe my card on any number of secure devices tied to paypal where only the merchant needs internet access. This isn't solving a barrier unless you're already past the 'I own bitcoin' one. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:39:52


IE you can have a line of credit in the same sense that merchants would hold for customers in the early 1900's, except it's tied to your account or your cellphone providers accounts due on your account. 
Meaning, you walk into my shop and you can pay me via phone rather than cash or credit. 


That's direct. 
So please, in what would have been 3 fully formed paragraphs of an article without the spacing,  what did I miss? If its the part about building payments on top of android, than it's literally exactly what paypal has been doing forever. 
Extra edit: any time you see an article reference 'bricks and mortar' stores, you should have a red flag go up. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:29:57


Did you read your own post? If something integrates something else, that means that it is existing and allowing something else to happen. 
To go even further after reading your comments, you describe absolutely nothing new to the market except in reference to bitcoin, which isnt even mentioned in the article. You're creating your own currency scenario here, covering a situation you don't think exists simply because it hasnt been adopted to bit and even adopting a current situation into a bit scenario, when you're the only one that said bit. 
Tl;Dr this already happens with currencies and you're the one that saw this and thought bit, not the developers who are creating a currency based app.

Except instead of farming a commodity that is needed by people to consume in order to live, it's one that is fabricated from a reliance on technology and given a market value. And again, having a rich person betting that the value of the farmers crop will be greater than the farmers estimate isn't exactly great. Hopefully nobody here is tied to their land and mortgage like the farmer hoping for a good bitcoin harvest next season. 
Edit: I mean please, tell me how this is good for bitcoin users. It's not even a way to use coins, it's a way to invest in a way that is tied to bitcoin. That means that you're not dropping bit thinking that you're going to get more later, it means that you're spending physical (digital) currency in exchange for an option that is tied to the exchange rate of coin. In other words, that means that if you're a farmer and the price of bitcoin drops when you sold short, you're in debt for whatever your bitcoin didn't cover according to your analogy. Bit's a little more volatile than corn. And the chart where the price jumps when less coins are being sold just yells false scarcity. 
And if the bigger wallet holders ($$ and bit) were smart, theyd sell enough short options to cover and then dump enough into the market to drop the price. 
TL;DR Koch money would Koch slap bitcoin in the face in the worlds most obvious poker hand. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 04:30:34
rich people literally betting on whether the price will rise or drop doesn't really do any good for the platform.
