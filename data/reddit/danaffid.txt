Relatively common in Europe in general, as well as other payment methods they'll be adding soon (Sofort and GiroPay)

Thanks for the honest feedback :)

When they'll start driving traffic i'll perform a proper a\b testing. 
I do want the CSS buttons because they are easier to work with, but if the green will perform better we'll simply design Green CSS button.

No problem, i'm more interested in your feedback.
Just checked, the fix was applied (you'll might need to refresh).

I'm not speaking here officially, but i'll explain what I know.
Credit card commision for "High Risk" transactions (and BTC is by definition high risk according to CC companies) are extremely high, they also have to hedge against CC fraud. 
They are not subsidized by angel investors, they've used their own money for it so they can't afford to lose money on the transactions.  Their net profit margin is small.

What I love about them even more is that they are dynamic (I don't need a designer for every language\colour change).
The site supposed to be translated to many languages, it'll much more easier to use a template. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:25:11
You're correct. I'll start working with the designer to fix it. Thanks!

The German site is just a start. In 2-3 months they are launching the UK site. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:21:35
You have a good point. I'll change the phrasing. 
The site currently directs to blockchain.info/wallet , can you offer a better, user-friendly alternative? Keep in mind the site is targeting new users, not necessarily tech-savvy.  
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:30:46
OK, I see the encoding issue. It's on an external (secure billing) domain so it'll take a programer to fix it.
Can't replicate the CSS ficker, any chance you can share what computer\OS\browser you're using?  
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:20:46
I'll get a mac and test it. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:15:27
Mobile sucks indeed, we'll fix it next month.

[optimizely]( are good at that kind of things.   I usually test with Analytics + Hotjar\CrazyEgg, but i'm not gonna duplicate entire page for a single element. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:38:34
Sounds reasonable.
Changed to "Um eine Bitcoin-Brieftasche zu bekommen, gehen Sie bitte zu 
Will be live in about 10 minutes. Thanks!

Mmm... 
I see what you say about the button. I'm thinking about replacing it with CSS button like one of [these](  
As for release date, the service is fully functional and will be for a limited  period (I believe they currently have only 100-150 BTC to sell).
 
They'll start actively promoting it after they'll finish API integration with the Exchanges so they'll be able to by dynamically. Probably will take a week or 2. 
Just a heads up: For the first withdrawal you'll need to send them ID and proof of residence. I've put a big warning in the purchase process but i'm not sure it's clear enough.     
@_date: 2014-10-03 09:56:22
1) They accept only [3-D Secure]( payments 
2) They allow a withdrawal only after the user has sent them ID docs that matches the card (though from what I understand, they possibly have to do it due to anti money laundering regulation and not because of security).
The whole purpose of the site is to be very accessible for first timers. If there's interest i'll be happy to share the heatmaps and show how new users react to it

He's not talking about cash advance...
