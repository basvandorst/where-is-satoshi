No, it's a HTML5 wallet, meaning that it runs in your browser. Your phone doesn't need to be jailbroken.

That wiki is the Bitcoin wiki which is not affiliated with Apparently someone meaning to scam added it to the wiki and fooled you this way. This is the nature of wikis; anyone can edit them. You should at the very least Google the domain next time, the fourth link when googling bitmixer.info was a link to the bitcointalk forums where someone complained they scammed him. I'm sorry to say, but the only one to blame for this is you and the scammer.

Haha you just gave me a flashback! I used to play Runescape back in the day, and was often on the SwiftIRC network. I coded quite a lot of scripts in the mIRC scripting language as a kid, the first programming language I ever learned too!

The online wallet needs Bitcoin-Qt/Bitcoind to run in the background to keep the blockchain synchronized. Armory (the newest version at least) will install and run bitcoind in the background for you. You won't be able to communicate with bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt and don't have to. Armory just uses its existing code. So no, you don't need to import your wallet in Bitcoin-Qt, you don't need (nor will you be able to) to interact with it at all.
And the point of offline wallets is to not have your private keys available on a computer connected to the internet. A watching-only copy is a copy of your wallet without any private keys. So to send a transaction you'll need to sign it on your offline PC and broadcast it on your online PC.

Because bitcoins are "stored" on a public ledger and not your PC, it doesn't matter. Bitcoin-Qt syncing is just to have it show up the correct amount of bitcoins on your PC.
You may not be able to spend them using Bitcoin-Qt though, because it won't know how many bitcoins it has access to if it's not synced. You can however grab your private key and use a site like brainwallet.org (transactions tab) to spend your bitcoins.

With Bitcoin, you don't *actually* send people money, the public ledger just records that a certain public key and its corresponding private key can spend X amount of bitcoins. So yes, if they have a private key, you can send 'them' bitcoins.
It'll take a while for them to see that the bitcoins have arrived though (on Mars, the ISS isn't that far away), because the information (blockchain updates) can only travel as fast as the speed of light.

Well done :)
About the "International? Not yet!" part, people in other countries are still able to send and receive text messages to and from USA numbers. I just tested it out (I'm outside of the USA). It took a couple of minutes but I got a text message back with the price.

Just like it's no problem to receive/exchange $0.50 or $0.25, it's no problem either to receive/exchange 0.01 BTC or 0.005 BTC. It's the same principle. Most trading is actually done in fractions smaller than 1 BTC.
But as pretty much everyone else in this thread has said, it depends on what country you live in. Localbitcoins.com is probably a good bet, there'll probably be plenty of sellers, regardless of what country you are in.
