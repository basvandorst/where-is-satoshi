He wasn’t wrong though. JPM invests heavily in crypto ETN’s - “According to Bitcoin.com, JP Morgan routed the most XBT shares of all of the big banks included in the list of purchasers.”
His move was probably very calculated because he drove the price down momentarily creating a great entry point. My point is that you can’t take everything industry leaders say at face value. There are always underlying motives and they don’t always have to line up with your first assumptions.

This will be my last comment in this string because it's always the same stuff and gets old running this down. 
1.  "You assume there is a they. As in a group working together monitoring and connecting all this data. That’s the conspiracy part." - The NSA, CIA, DIA, FBI, Mossad, MI6... These are all groups, working together as well as against each other, monitoring and connecting data. As before mentioned 5 Eyes is a great example. 
2.  "In reality the agency monitoring cellular data is different from the one monitoring the blockchain, which doesn’t talk to the one tracking fiat transactions and the guys putting backdoors into smartphones are not talking to anyone because they are terrified of their zero day exploits getting patched." - The majority of what you say is completely made up and it's bizarre. You show next to zero knowledge of how the intel community works and statements like the above prove it.
3. "If what you believe was true crime wouldn’t exist. The FBI would know the exact position of every drug dealer, mass shootings that get basically announced on Internet forums wouldn’t happen and laundering money would be impossible for anyone but state actors with extremely sophisticated counter measures." - Mass shootings are generally manipulated by the state. False flags are used for several reasons but the usual case is to redirect media narrative or take out targets. Money laundering happens in many forms - some of the most common are - the art trade and personal foundations (why every billionaire has a foundation and why the majority of the public billionaires claim to pledge the entirety of their fortunes to charity when they die. In reality they're moving their funds to their own foundations ("Charity") which will avoid tax and be passed on/controlled by whoever they please.)
4. "Reality is they can’t even reliably trace fiat bank transfer internationally unless it’s a national emergency with the Vice President screaming at them. They are extremely competitive and secretive, and data on the level of even petty crimes is simply not shared between the agencies to be connected. They can find out a lot of shit on you if they tried, but they won’t. There is no dossier of you on some internal Wikipedia of government agencies, you are not actively monitored any more than algae is intentionally pulled out of the ocean by fishermen." - international fiat bank transfers are readily available for review. There is a wall of regulation and reporting which banks have to adhere to [ . Having worked at a BB bank in treasury for several years I know all about EFT/ACH payments. Your point above is yet another thing you strangely made up to make your point. Secondly, [ this is just one more confirmation that, yes... there are databases containing dossiers about everyone. Again, you're making random conjectures which you have no ability to back up other than an appeal to emotion. 
5. "Also I find it ironic that your post is full of unprovable statements and feelings. Because black budgets exist you can link intelligence agencies to the 21 trillion debt. If that was true they would have fuckall to show for it, the incompetency would be even higher that what i insinuated given how much is going wrong in the US currently both domestic and internationally. " - You say this, but give no real examples. The reason you can't is because nearly everything I've said comes with a source. The reason I don't add more is because I don't have the want or inclination to write back and forth with you all day. The $21 trillion in debt with nothing public to show for it is proof of money laundering and malfeasance, not incompetence. It also shows that the purse strings of the government and affiliated agencies are limitless - meaning they can fund many extensive operations which are not publicly known. Also, wars most countries enter are to line pockets, not to defend freedoms. The money that has been siphoned from the American public is being used by the elites who have plenty to show for it. They have billions of slaves working their way out of unending debt every single day, technology which is decades ahead of the general public's, and the freedom to spend their time doing absolutely anything that they want.

The internet was created by ARPA and all microchips are built with backdoors. None of your electronic activity or transactions are private in the slightest - regardless of how many VPN’s you think you’re hiding behind. 
Also, considering how gullible everyone is - the entire inception story of bitcoin is also a funny one. Some faceless guy named Satoshi created a 100+b currency which is expected to supplant the world economy... in other words - in-Q-Tel/DARPA created a currency as well as a stupid back story for it. A currency with the illusion of anonymity which is the exact opposite of reality.

The point is that every single thing that you do is monitored, recorded, stored, and analyzed. That especially goes for any transactions saved in the blockchain. The US gov collects tens (probably more) of petabytes of metadata on a daily basis.
You use words like "conspiratorial bullshit" yet nothing which I said is false or "conspiratorial" in the way that you mean to use the word. This is a very common deflection tactic when others have no substantiated argument - rather they (you) go off of emotion  
("**To me** It’s just the usual conspiracy bullshit enlightenment that adds **nothing** to a discussion" = personal feelings
Also, it adds to the discussion due to Bitcoin being a lie. A mass of people are under the illusion that they've somehow skirted the gov in regards to tax, currency, the public market, privacy, etc. It's probably important to know.
"**To me** that’s proof of this very incompetency" = personal feelings
"**Nothing I see** in today’s world hints at any sort of competency of the scale required by what you imply" = personal feelings
"Yes, they do all of the things those links say." - Thank you, I know
**"But that doesn’t mean they do it well**." = Personal feelings 
"They can’t even stop the PotUS from chatting national security details over WhatsApp on his android phone or directly tweeting raw spysat images." - There are constant intelligence and counterintelligence operations at work. The MSM constantly lies and makes up stories and the intelligence agencies/DOJ/POTUS are constantly manipulating the stories that come out. In fact, they manipulate everything down to the music you listen to and the movies you watch.  [ 
"No government agency can get **anything** useful done on that kind of budget." - Luckily for them there are such things as black budgets. Black budgets are funded by siphoning/laundering public funds and "charity funds" ($21 Trillion dollars of debt with nothing to show from it - that we know of), drug trafficking, human trafficking, weapons trafficking, etc.
You - "Again, what is the relation to crypto specifically bitcoin? All the transactions are already public, all the common **online** ways to acquire btc already employ kyc, all the **offline** ways of transacting cash to btc do not get monitored by these programs."
Yes, they do. Metadata collected via cell phones, satellites, street cameras, social media, email, text, internet, etc. etc. etc. - has the ability to break down your daily actions down to the T. When you're able to break down someone's every move - you're can pretty easily triangulate associations, wallets, purchases, transfers, etc.
TLDR: Feelings &lt;&gt; Fact

Great ad hominem and non sequitur. Only problem is that you didn’t refute anything because my statements were factual.
1.  - ARPA did in fact create the internet. ARPA was funded and founded by DARPA which is the “agency of the US DOD responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.”
2.  - “Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation.” Aka - no one knows who created bitcoin but it is widely accepted that some random genius created Bitcoin for the good of the earth. Very dumb.
3.  - bitcoin’s market cap is well over 100b 
4. 
It would take all day to post all of the known programs, declassed documents, and other publicly known information - but this should be enough to get you started. this is mostly just NSA stuff - which is just the tip of the iceberg when you dig into the CIA/in-Q-tel, palantir, 5eyes, etc. I’m hopeful that you start thinking for yourself soon, because being willfully ignorant isn’t good.
TLDR: it’s not that I’m that smart, it’s just that you’re uneducated.
