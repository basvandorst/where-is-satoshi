Yes, it would be possible to create such SMS service which doesn't need to hold your private keys (the money itself). Transaction sizes are usually about 500 bytes so they unfortunately require multiple SMS messages. If you build an SMS wallet service though, it is easy to pack target address and the amount in a single SMS. But then of course you need to trust the wallet service.

Yeah, but will use signatures to address that issue. The packet signing may be done using our key or we can even use another entity for signing. Or if you don't want to trust a single entity, then we can add multiple signatures to the same packet (block or transaction).

That's correct. Also, if that's impossible or you want to make a public contribution to the project then you can send e-mail to the maintainer (me) and ask for a personal address.

It is centralised in the sense that the signal comes from high power transmitters used to broadcast the TV channels as well. But the infrastructure is highly reliable and continuously monitored. In my view it is a perfect companion for peer-to-peer technology. It is difficult to shut them both down.
Of course the uplink is not covered. But an ordinary transaction is about 500 bytes so it's easy to send it via mobile data, radio amateur band, or even multi-message SMS.

Not state owned anymore but still has the largest coverage (multiplexes A and B). For the pilot we didn't choose the largest area which covers the Lapland as a whole because that would be more expensive. In pilot we chose to have 95% of Finnish population covered.

Currently, the data rate is only about 7.5 kilobits per second which includes market data (Bitstamp order book and trades) in addition to Bitcoin blocks and transactions. There are some nice optimization tricks we are using to make everything fit into such small bandwidth, but more of that later, when we have the receiver part running. The receiver is going to be available in a week.
Sometimes bitcoin transactions get queued because they are not uniformly distributed on time. This issue is easy to solve with some money (buying more bandwidth). :-)

Fortunately ATSC is also using MPEG-TS so it would be quite straightforward to support ATSC as well. The only major difference is the hardware.

Welcome :-) I'm working at Bittiraha as project manager of our dev team so I'm happy to meet our new shareholders here on Reddit, too. :-)

That's true. You've got to trust the manufacturer in case of "traditional" physical bitcoins.
But it's now possible to combine the best parts of self printed paper wallet and physical coin with multisig. Denarium launched such product couple of days ago:

There is now 2-of-2 multisig coin available from Denarium as both empty and loaded which solves the counter-party risk of Denarium having extra copy of the private key.

Yeah, they are non-transferable (unless you give a copy of the second-factor private key with the coin). The multisig product is more suited for personal use. But there will be "ordinary" coins available, too. Any Denarium product can be bought without multisig as well.
