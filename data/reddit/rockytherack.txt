Why is taking 2012 alone better than taking 2010-2015?

It absolutely is not the most overturned in the country. Fake news. Sad. How does Donald's cock taste?
"The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15.  The 9th Circuit is in third place."

The travel order was stopped by a federal court. You are acting like Trump realized he made a mistake and fixed the situation- he tried to keep legal green card holders from coming back into the country.
Impressive newspeak, comrade.

Fake news. Sad. Do you always get all of your news from Sean Hannity? 
"In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent.
