spending TO an address does not expose the public key of that address
spending FROM an address does publicize the public key of the address


No, putting funds into a paper wallet does not expose the wallet address' public key.  However, when you spend from or sweep that paper wallet, the public key is exposed.

It's more likely that you haven't shared your private key with anyone (even if encrypted) as there's no reason to.  A better description is that your coins are hidden in the vast address space that makes up the possible number of bitcoin addresses.

Wikipedia's article is pretty good.  "A fundamental problem in distributed computing is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes."

Way to go, qz.com.
As to the content of the reply, I wonder what he thinks about the anonymity of cash.
@_date: 2015-10-16 19:25:04
Here's my proposal:
**cash &gt; BTC:** Insert cash, it scans a QR code on your phone and sends you the BTC.  Or alternatively prints you a receipt with a private key.
**BTC &gt; cash:** It displays a QR code that you send BTC to.  If the transaction looks good, it dispenses cash.
But I'm no genius.  Probably we should continue making Bitcoin ATMs that require you to create an account, enter your email and SSN and phone number, wait one hour for a real person to check that your name isn't on the secret list of suspicious persons, and get texted a PIN which you then have to enter back into the ATM.

I'll second Bitcoinpaperwallet.  I generated my addresses using dice (base 6) and bitaddress.org (offline, of course) and then entered the addresses into Bitcoinpaperwallet (also offline) and BIP-38 encrypted them.  Wish one of the keygens by itself would do both.  Bitcoinpaperwallet doesn't actually use the base 6 number directly but instead just hashes the die rolls.  Probably just as secure but I like to feel like my die rolls were "used."
I did this on a Raspberry Pi 2 and destroyed the SD card afterwards just so I could feel safer.  Note that BIP-38 encryption on a Raspberry Pi 2 takes a LONG time.  About 10 minutes per address.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:04:37
Yep.  If you're investing long term, Coinbase is great.  Just make sure to move the coins to an address you control as soon as possible.
If you're actually SPENDING bitcoins day to day, using Coinbase is like playing with fire.  You never know when someone you passed coins to might buy some contraband/drugs/banned books with the result that Coinbase freezes your account.
@_date: 2015-10-27 12:43:44
Trying to day trade is a guaranteed way to lose your investment.
Buy whatever amount you're looking to invest and hold onto it for five years, then reevaluate.  There are only 21 million bitcoins and if it becomes popular as a store of value, its value will likely skyrocket.

If the client didn't pay properly (it looks like the transaction may never make it into a block or arrive days later), they don't get the goods.  Generate a new address for them to try again.  IF the no-fee transaction is confirmed eventually, send the BTC back.

@_date: 2015-10-09 15:49:47
Agreed, with the caveat that it depends on where you live.  In the U.S., retire early for me equates to AT LEAST $1,000,000 USD, and probably several times that.  If Bitcoin ever reaches $1,000,000 per coin I'll eat my hat.  In other locales, maybe you can retire early at $100,000, and there's the slimmest of chances that Bitcoin will reach that high in a few decades.

To be honest I don't know enough about printing because I rarely print.  I think the worry with printers is that a few store documents in memory long after printing.
If you're printing wallets, I think it's better to be printing BIP-38 encrypted wallets with a strong password.  That way you don't have to worry about anyone getting a copy since they won't have your private key unless they know your password.

If you're saving Bitcoin long term (ex. 5 years): BIP-38 encrypted paper wallet.  Print many copies, spread them around, and keep the password in your brain.
Short term spending Bitcoin: Just keep it in your phone with Breadwallet.  Make sure you write down the backup phrase and keep it safe at home somewhere in case your phone is stolen or damaged.

Don't know about Circle, but Coinbase monitors what addresses your coins go to.  If you give a friend BTC and then he buys something from the darkweb or just something Coinbase considers contraband, your account may be frozen.

For moving money, spending money, hot wallets: Breadwallet
For storage: BIP-38 paper wallet in multiple locations

Get your coins off of your computer.  Keep spending coins on your phone, and the rest in cold storage paper wallets.

When I think precious metals, I think Fox News and the 65+ crowd.  I know that's not strictly, true, but I'd rather have my money in Bitcoin and stocks - known limits - rather than something like gold of which there is still an abundance in nature.

LibertyX is your best bet.  See if there's a participating location near you, sign up online, then go pay cash.  You'll receive a pin which you'll enter into their website and they'll send you your bitcoins.  Takes less than an hour, including signup time.
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:35:42
Then each bitcoin would be worth $3333.33.

If ASICs become widespread as embedded tech in many consumer devices, "home" mining will take off.  But pooled mining is probably here to stay.  Better a small trickle of BTC than nothing with a microscopic chance of mining a full block.
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:15:01


The fastest way to buy is through LibertyX.  They probably have a participating retailer near you.  Sign up online on their website, then go to the store and buy a PIN with cash (maybe debit works too, I'm not sure).  Return home, enter the PIN online, and they send you your bitcoins.
From start to BTC in Breadwallet: 45 minutes or less.
I've also had great luck with Coinbase, but it takes a week or so to get your account setup and another week or so to get your bitcoin.  Plus they have a habit of shutting down accounts if BTC you buy through them ends up in the hands of someone they don't like.  (Imagine if dollars worked that way!)  So I use them for the online convenience but am wary.

Honestly I think nowadays if I was introducing someone to bitcoin I would have them download Breadwallet and just use their phone.  Unless they wanted to store coins longterm or in large amounts - in that case I'd recommend a BIP-38 paper wallet.

Ah, the old "X, but on the internet!" patent forms are being updated.
"X, but with cryptocurrency/blockchains!"

I used it offline on a Raspberry Pi to create a handful of paperwallets using dice with its base 6 key generator.  Worked like a charm.

They haven't been taking orders since June.

Hold them for five years and then reevaluate.  They'll probably have increased in value quite a bit.
No guarantees, naturally.

Lol.  If I can't trust the Sandie Go Reader, who can I trust?
(Truly a terrible article.)

Circle, maybe.  Since credit card transactions can be reversed and bitcoin transactions cannot there are few places that will sell you bitcoin for credit.

LibertyX is the fastest I've used.  If you're starting up a new account, you can have your BTC in less than an hour.  If you're an existing customer, I guess it's mere minutes.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:43:32
Perhaps their customers are used to more traditional exchanges.
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:02:14
Yes, but then the records themselves have to be stored someplace offchain.

There is no Bitcoin mining rig/investment where that statement is true.  You and/or your friend are being misled.  Bitcoin mining is just a little bit profitable **if** you have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest and near-free electricity.
If you want to invest in Bitcoin, buy it outright.  You'll end up with more Bitcoin than you would by mining AND if Bitcoin ever does become a popular store of value, you'll make out like a bandit.  Just don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

If you're interested in Bitcoin speculation, you should probably be interested in longer terms.  Five years, for example.  I and many others believe that years from now, the value of Bitcoin is going to be dramatically increased compared to its value in 2015.

Did mine with diceware on a Raspberry Pi 2.  BIP-38 encryption (using offline version of [bitcoinpaperwallet]( took AGES on the Rpi2, though.

Also, DON'T spend any Bitcoin that you bought from Coinbase (and maybe Circle).  Just transfer it to an address in your control and hold it.  
If you need some Bitcoin spending money, buy through another service like LibertyX, or LocalBitcoins.  Coinbase keeps track of where your Bitcoins go and if you spend them on something that Coinbase deems illicit (or you spend them on something "innocent" and then that person spends them on something "illicit"), Coinbase will close your account without warning.
