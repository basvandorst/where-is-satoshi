Taxation is theft, so long as the UN recognizes your own land as belonging to you. Part of this recognition will entail providing evidence that you rule a sovereign nation.  
If you use the infrastructure of any other nation (water, gas, materials, sewage system) you're going to have a hell of a time convincing the UN that *you* have complete sovereignty over your property. Also if someone else laid claim to that land prior to you, good luck getting recognized as it's only owner...
Basically citizens of western countries and jurisdictions are ultimately residents on national land, regardless of what we think to be fair or not. No human really owns anything, we just have acknowledgement of ownership from humans of varying stripes and colours. 
TLDR; those taxes you are being asked to pay are legitimate until you can muscle your independence, or somehow convince the right people you don't owe them. Taxes are a shakedown yes, but they are proven vital in maintaining public infrastructure.

No. This is a great misconception made very popular by a great many people with the best of intentions. 
Rather, Bitcoin is the common sense solution. Libertarianism lays it's foundation in an unregulated free market. With Bitcoin the market doesn't decide in order to prevent abuses of the system.

If we remove civilization we don't somehow magically get an ideal civilization.
When you remove government, even if it's a shitty government--or when you remove regulation, even if it's shitty regulation, you don't magically get some kind of perfect world because we're all free to choose.
It's NOT my regulations. They are not my "beloved regulations". Frankly I'd rather live in a world without them where you and I could be trusted not to bring destructive species to each other's countries that don't belong by way of oil tanker--or be trusted to set a capped price on certain goods so we don't rob the public blind of their hard earned money etc. But we can't be trusted, and neither can anyone else.
I want you to give me an alternative other than "the free market." Seems like we've had a lot of free market action resulting in oligopolies and monopolies over the course of time. If anything we need a solution to the abuse of governmental and private sector power, not to remove the "leash" and let the rabid dogs run rampant through the free market. If anything we need some kind of accountability for government AND big business in the Western world. Opening up the markets for more abuse does not create a better more free market.
How about this example.
Businesses taking advantage of you and me now maybe didn't start out in some "free maket" and therefore can't accurately be judged on how they would operate in a free market, but we would be insane not to think that somehow corruption and greed would not affect a free market system with limited/no regulation. Human problems, are human problems, are human problems.
In an ideal world we're ready for a market that regulates itself. Right now regulations and government are ineffective solutions that mitigate the damage of humanity's selfish tribal mentality. 
I don't know how many more ways I can say it. I'm getting tired of explaining to libertarians that humans are flawed and if left to their own devices... I'm guessing you never read Lord of the Flies.

Scarcity is, as I will explain again, only a single factor of multiple factors that can/do decide currency value measured against other currencies and/or goods and/or services. Value is completely subjective, if you want to get into philosophy. What is worth nothing to one person is worth more than the entire world's fortune of gold to another person (hypothetical). Because of the nature of subjectivity it is and always will be impossible to measure the exact value of anything, ideas, goods, services or anything else. This means that value is always in flux, and you or I can never assert anything but a guess as to what a dollar bill of any currency--or a virtual BTC, is worth or will be worth in the future. The numbers we use to determine currency value are a plethora of best-guesses, and at best provide a cloudy reflection of market conditions.

Socialism (non-Marxist so the one the rest of the world outside of  Russia uses): A political and economic theory of that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated...
A List of Socialist Democracies: France, Canada, allegedly the USA etc.
Socialism means regulation, not complete totalitarian control as the US govt. is beginning to brazenly demonstrate to the entire world as of late...
Anyhow, Socialism is often a misunderstood term (ala your comment's negative rating). It's really just a broad term used to describe a political system that favors the people, looks out for it's weakest, and gives everyone the opportunity to succeed and compete in a free/somewhat regulated market. 
No political ideology has worked long enough though. So I'm not for any of them just for the record ;) 
And we haven't seen Libertarianism in full flight yet in mass scale, so basically any functional political/economic alternative to all the varieties we see now is likely to remain unproven for some time.

I never once mentioned or condoned any ethical principle other than the benefit of the many. I never suggested that the few be marginalized for the needs of the many. That sir, is what you have suggested--and I can only infer that you chose to view taxation as a form of subjugation or some inherently evil morally bankrupt institution. 
I don't view it as such, that much is clear. 
History is against you. Taxation does not = immorality. Quite the opposite. Taxation in theory (and as demonstrated through thousands of years of practice) provides a government with supplemental funding.
If the actions of said government (or power structure) are morally bankrupt, why must we blame the pooling of collective funds supporting a government instead of the government itself? 
In conclusion, you said; "Are you trying to justify immoral behavior against an individual for the better of the collective?"
No, I'm not. I never even mentioned morality in my previous comment you were replying to. Now that the conversation of morality is on the table, I suggest you judge the power structures (that control taxation and how it is implemented and used) yourself, not the POT OF MONEY the power structures collect. 
You sir, are what poisons Libertarian ideology.

Someone please explain how if my password is "1", my bitcoins wallet.dat is stored on the same hard drive as the BITCOIN QT--explain how someone who gets a VERY POSSIBLE TO GET disc image of my hard drive has to do anything other than figure out if my password is ABC123 or "1" in this case to crack my wallet and be able to perform transactions at their own will.

I agree at first. Any currency worth value in this modern world typically is pitted up against another currency to measure it's value. BTC/USD is a match up that helps us determine the value of BTC.

@_date: 2013-06-15 02:27:29
If your wallet.dat and all Bitcoin QT files are on the same hard drive, and a hacker obtains a disk image of this hard drive, does it not mean that they only have 1 password to crack and they don't have to go through decrypting AES256? That would mean they could easily Brute Force your wallet and gain access to all your coins but simply compiling a script in python that let's say creates a new address and uses a standard brute force algorithm. The password might be impossibly long with crazy characters so I see how the task might seem insurmountable. But most people don't pick a long ass password unless they are storing it offline.

Taxation is the collective pooling of funds to serve use by a government. In the case of Socialist Democracies such as the USA, Canada(Socialist Democratic Monarchy), or England (Socialist Democratic Monarchy), we see the use of tax dollars funding all sorts of things from public health care, old age pensions(medicare etc.) to purchasing weapons of war etc. A business operating out of let's say the USA is likely paying tax dollars, as are it's shored employees. In order to gain the economic benefits of operating and organization inside a country or based out of a country, said businesses owners must comply with that countries tax code. The same goes for the citizens of the USA. 
If nobody pays a % premium to live/work/run a business based in the USA, then ultimately the government will collapse and the once lucrative state of that country to business and people will fail. 
Basically, without taxation right now (let's use the USA for an example), = no economic stability, no political stability, and moreover no funding  to the public services you are/have been/were using at some point in the last 7 days which all leads to one ultimate finale; the inevitable collapse of everything you have ever known. To wish such a server fate on anyone is immoral. Yes, that's right, I'm calling your "call for the end of taxation immediately"  immoral.  
There is no black and white on this issue sir, only grey. I stick to what I said prior, and also to this; anyone so insulated as to suggest all of taxation is inherently evil can not and will not accept the complexity of modern political and economical concepts.

@_date: 2013-06-04 20:43:07
"Seem to be" = conjecture. Governments have been successful at many things during history. Many empires have come and gone. Laws have passed which benefited every single citizen etc.
Money is not the only incentive to perform adequate work.
Sometimes the benefit of people who have elected you to represent them actually IS the motivator. 
I would argue that democracy has and is failing today in varying degrees, however that does not take away the countless hours people like Lincoln, Chretien, Trudeau, Carter etc. spent toiling trying to get it right for the people they represented. However infected democracy and government taxation are, they still make sense in principle.
If someone offered me a functional government that actually represented it's citizens, and alternatively offered me a country with absolutely no regulation or government, I would take the former in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately for you and me, we can have neither and are forced to live in this mess we call a  socialist/capitalistic democracy (assuming you and I live in the Western World).

You're right in that it won't "properly reflect" the block chain due to the fact that the blockchain is an independent decentralized entity and ETFs are just a ponzi scheme to attempt to harness the cat if you will. ETFs will fail at this, but what will succeed is increasing awareness and demand of BTC across all trading platforms. I would love for people to invest 60 billion dollars into this ETF. Great. At some point when the demand keeps getting higher and higher for a single Bitcoin, people are going to start to hold. And all of a sudden the power will go right back to the users not invested in the ETF; the users who hold ACTUAL Bitcoins.

It already was created recently in Primecoin (XPM). However, as you see BTC is still going strong because it has the confidence of nearly the entire crypto-community. Primecoin could be a very sound long term investment as it has paved the way with a more innovative proof of work. There may very well be "cancercurecoin" released years from now, but if Primecoin has years to develop user confidence it's likely to retain value as compared to newer and improved cryptocurrencies.
My theory is this: each new proof of work/crypto currency concept needs to up the ante exponentially to maintain market competitiveness. 
Basically this means that in the long run the so called "scamcoins" offering nothing new and/or special and/or simply not offering enough improvements/innovation will not merit substantial confidence, and will ultimately be less successful and worth less than BTC.

And when USD and all other fiat is worth less than the gum on my shoe (compared to cryptocurrency), this is how power structures holding their now accumulated fortunes of BTC are going to exploit and abuse those left with USD in their hands. How do people not see this coming? Buy up the BTC, let people invest USD into it, now you have BTC and USD in your wallets. Great.

Yes they will integrate Bitcoin into Paypal and still charge 5% on BTC transactions via Paypal proxy. Then more merchants begin to sell their products for BTC at reduced or lower-than-Paypal fees, skipping the middle man. 
Much like the FOREX hosting market you will have multiple companies competing over the lowest fees possible. To be honest I think if Paypal treats BTC like USD it will be fatal to their business model.

Paypal is just covering it's ass. Although more defined and recently declared a currency by the United States Supreme Court, BTC has yet have bestowed upon it some of the most important regulatory and legal guidelines the most prominent currencies hold/require to be considered legal tender (basically the rich and/or powerful agreeing on something). Because BTC is not yet what could be considered "legal tender" this among all things seems to be the  reason paypal has it's "no-go" BTC policy today. Money is money. Let's all take off the tinfoil hats and realize PayPal is no different than any other online merchant; desperately greedy and generally concerned with their own interests or the interests of anyone giving them money (generally concerned) and will adopt BTC as soon as they get the ok from US Congress.    
Basically BTC adoption is becoming more and more inevitable every day. It's only a matter of time, and a matter of how hard BTC is lobbied in Congress.

Aren't you making a similar assumptionin in that the difficulty will not taper or may in fact go down once the network hash rate has stabilized?
How can we know what the peak network hash rate will be?
Maybe there will be a lul of 1 or 2 years before BTC is adopted by more countries and in that time the network hash rate stabilizes.
If we assume difficulty will continue on the present trend on bell curve upwards, then we're making the same mistake people made when they assumed BTC wouldn't ever be worth a significant amount of USD. Current trends may often define predictable future trends, but not always.

I couldn't agree more. That's what "distinguishes it from Litecoin," as you say. However, I was arguing an irrefutable argument: the value of all currency ultimately lies in speculation. This is not to say there are not countless factors that determine the value of a currency. Not at all. It's just saying something is only worth anything if somebody/people agree it has value. In the case of Bitcoin and Litecoin, this principle is evident. Which one is most novel? Which ones is more "special" than the other? That's not for logic to decide, it's for the market to decide. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 12:38:45
Which is exactly why our financial system is just. They probably laundered at 90-70 cents on the dollar. Even at 9-1 that's still 68 billion. So a 1.9B charge is about 2.7% of projected profits given these hypothetical numbers.
2.7% = Fair. How are banks supposed to make money if they can't launder a little cocaine money now and again? Huh? What are they going to do, rob us with interest rates and phony mortgages? They'd never do that.
BTC replaces a system that works perfectly on its own as you can see &amp;

That's like getting a few minutes with Cesar, or Einstein. Cherish every moment and scrutinize your questions.

Bitcoin just like Litecoin, regardless of what it brings to the table, is worth something because of speculator attributed value. If there was a coin to come out tomorrow called "asscoin" and everybody loved it and it took over BTC as the  but brought nothing new to the table, it would be because the speculators had their final bid.
Widespread use, scarcity, innovation, "I-was-here-first" mentality--all that attributes to the speculative value of cryptocurrencies. But none of those factors guarantee speculator confidence or long term value of any cryptocurrency. It's about time people realize that even if LTC is nothing new, if everyone views it as silver to BTC's gold, then it "IS" silver to BTC's gold. Is that right? Is it fair? Is it logical? Probably not any of the former 3 in my opinion. But right or fair or logical aren't the final determining factors of any currencies, especially cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 11:26:48

I wasn't talking about brute-forcing the encrypted password. And I sure as hell was not talking about brute forcing a massive password. I was just talking about brute-forcing a simple password. If the wallet password is quite long and random I could see your point--but if you're just brute forcing "larry6703/$545" then it's entirely possible with computer capabilities being as they are today. 
Since it's a disk image you are guessing the original password not an encrypted password.
Compiling a brute force attack it quite easy and even a layman can do it with simple guidance. It seems you think that the encryption process is happening inside the HDD and I am trying to get inside the wallet from the outside.
What I'm trying to say is if someone physically opened your wallet and only had 1 password to crack, and they assumed it was between 5-10 characters, you can crack it with a simple brute force attack. How is this such a difficult concept to explain?

Or potentially the demand for BTC will increase to the point of people not using lousy ETFs to speculate on their value. People will go direct to places like Mt.Gox and value will skyrocket.
Demand for BTC even let's say if it only came through these ETFs, would still increase the speculative value of BTC across all platforms of exchange. This is economics 101. If there is demand, there is value.

Oh yeah and the spying was likely going on since after WW2, but just became an industry after 9/11 (Bush and Obama). Ok people let's call spades spades. Forget party lines and left and right.

Is anyone familiar with film studies? I have a substantial amount of knowledge in this department including a college diploma in TV Broadcasting and a diploma in Canadian Film Studies.
Just to put it in perspective for people who think this is a scam, the cost of filming and post processing alone may not be covered by the over 70K donations given. Because of American technical unions/regulatory fees it really doesn't matter if they want to pay their camera men less or not, they are forced to pay them exorbitant amounts of money by law. Regulations are quite similar up here in Canada. 
This couple either has some deep-pocketed sponsors/producers, or they are easily fronting the majority of the budget themselves. 
Either way it's extremely likely they will be in the red after filming this (even on 2 full time salaries) as are most film makers in North America INCLUDING but not limited to many independent or low budget films.

The paper exchange will only serve to enhance BTCs value in the long run imo. In theory, BTC value would be further enhanced if there was a paper exchange speculating on the paper exchange speculating on the original paper exchange which is speculating on the value of Bitcoin. 
The more speculation the better for growth at least in the beginning. As for the future of Bitcoin, this paper market could be detrimental in the long run but that remains to be seen.

The issue is that AMD should place some sort of ASIC replication team in place to be proactive--businesses that react to the birth of new markets will profit much less or not at all compared to ones that proactively invest based on risk/reward.
BTC is highly volatile, but has huge upside. So in general terms that would mean a small investment is warranted. It's possible for ASIC technology to be used for something other than just BTC mining. There may be more than Bitcoins in this line of business.

It's not actually putting USD into BTC technically. I don't want to suggest investing in this to anyone in the Crypto-Community. You have to actually own Bitcoins in a wallet to own them--not have some kind of legal claim to someone else's Bitcoins. This ETF and ETFs like it will only give you the Cash or in this case the speculated USD value of BTC. Unless there are BTC withdrawl options (and I don't know that there will be) you're never going to get anything out of this other than USD. To any believers in crypto this is dangerous, because as a single currency becomes worth more and more, it gives the holders more power over alternate currencies and the people that use them. 
What this ETF does however, is publicize BTC and increase demand which in turn will raise the value of a single coin beyond anywhere we ever dreamed--that is if everything works out at planned.
