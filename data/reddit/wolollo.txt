I understand and agree. Maybe I should've been more specific. As traders in the pit and on the screen day trading - we aren't manipulating markets, just buying and selling based off movements and news. 
I agree and believe there's manipulation behind most anything that's tied to money and value

No - futures are traded on everything from commodities like hogs, cattle, oil and corn to interest rates. It's a bet on where that market will be in quarterly increments. It's not actual manipulation on the actual markets themselves. If the USD looked strong and healthy then most likely you'll see short sells on BTC futures. And if the USD outlook appears to be unhealthy and weak, then speculators would go long BTC futures.
It's just a bet on where the market is going, usually by the months of Sept, Dec, Mar, and June

After CME moved to the Board's floors, we had an arb desk set up on the floor to close S&amp;P pit trades

Amidst the China confusion, Dimon demonstrates the instability of this unregulated market. Shows the institutions just how easy it would be to manipulate the market with one interview. 
With a finite supply of coins, institutions can and will gain control of this market by buying it in chunks. Then our "decentralized protocol, free from the trappings of the current central banking system" becomes controlled by the people we're trying to dethrone

I was introduced to that world in 2000, and although I didn't have nearly the time put in that those guys had, I feel walking out of there after over ten years...you've usually seen some shit. Makes trading in this soft-space, behind Twitter accounts, and on Telegram groups a little more light-hearted

Where did you hear they brokered a Bitcoin purchase? Who the fuck uses a large clearing firm to purchase bitcoin through? Sums that large are generally people with half a brain. And people with half a brain would know they could purchase bitcoin in their underwear, dropping a deuce for an extremely cheap bitcoin transaction fee

Yeah but if mass adoption is what's being sought after and new Blockchains are constantly forked into existence, how does that look to someone that has little to no knowledge of this space? It looks shady and complicated. At least, that's my opinion

You think that was immoral? You have a very optimistic perception of the finance game then. Working as a floor trader at the CME for years has shown me the underbelly of this world. This stunt was a display of power and manipulation of an unregulated market and is making a case for attempted regulation and intervention in the trading of it. Institutions like JPM will have their hands in the commissions and executions of regulated exchanges. They're created the straw man that'll be used to orchestrate their case to the SEC
