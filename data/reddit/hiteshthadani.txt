make sure your port 8333 is open, instruction on how to do it are on the post above and also check you are receiving incoming connections at 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:56:19
In theory it should but its a good idea to run some checks. 
You can also select help under the file menu and in the debug panel you should see connections if you have some incoming connections you should be good.

I dont hold and BCH, I’m all for BTC. 
But if you look at it from a business perspective he is doing what’s good for him. So is Jihan or most siding with BCH. Everyone just wants to save their ass and get rich. They are all thinking economically and less technologically. Honestly anyone would think about their finance once they have power to fork or make changes. Power corrupts. 
What’s interesting is I always see roger (economic driven) promoting BCH, I would like to see some developer come in and talk about BCH. Roger has just got one memorized script that he repeats over and over again when he opens his mouth. 
I have seen a lot of developers talking about BTC that’s what makes me confident about it because they know what they are doing with the technology as opposed to someone who does not know the technology and is only looking for personal financial gains.

So when you first connected your ledger you should have received a 12 work seed key. 
You can write that seed key fragments in which ever way you like and place them in how many ever locations you like. 
I prefer storying my key in different locations fairly far apart from each other and on two mediums 
Example: I Store one paper copy at my work place which is 5km away or store them in another country and one copy at home 
And one copy on a different medium such as metal or stone or anything other medium. 
This way if there is a flood in my area where my house is, my paper will be destroyed but then I have another copy at work. Let’s say where is a flood at my house and work then I have another copy in metal which does not get destroyed in a flood

Yes, Gemini is good, bitmex is another Segwit exchange which is good. 
For wallets 
Ledger and Trevor are good. 
Also electrum, green address are good depending on the use-case

Also Google for changlly

If you use wallets like exodus, you have shapeshift built into it. So it’s easier to exchange. But again exodus does not support segwit if I’m not wrong, so your BTC exchanges fees will be off the roof as they don’t have custom fees option. 
If if you want to save fees on exodus, this is not one of the best practises due to security reasons but you could export your private key from exodus import it on blockchain.info and transact from there with custom fees.

Someone said it ! THANK YOU !

Coinbase is crap. 
Use a Segwit enabled wallet for bitcoin or any wallet for any other coin. 
Greenadress is good for bitcoin
Exodus is good for alt coins (any other coin other than bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:45:41
Today...no. 
just because the fees would be crazy which will go down as soon as assholes like coinbase and blockchain.info adopt segwit. 
But any other day. I would pay for my coffee in bitcoin and go home and buy back the bitcoins at a dip. Transacting in bitcoin just helps with the adoption and helps the network in many other ways. 
If you continue translating in fiat then you basically support fiat and defeats the whole purpose of the bitcoin technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:54:51
Well the current market for Cryptocurrency is just 1%-2%. 
As far as bitcoin is concerned we will only see coffee shops and stores around the world benefit is when lighting network comes in. 
This is a very disruptive technology, we have been so used to using fiat for 100’s of years
And it’s only been 10years for bitcoin to exist. Give it some time don’t run to make things happen today. Stability and security should be the first priority. We can not afford hacks on a 250billion dollar asset. Worst if we discover hacks and flaws on a 5 trillion dollar asset after a 5-10% adoption. The easiest solution is not always the right solution.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:00:27
Yea, security of your crypto assets is extremely important. 
Secure them in such a way that you, only you in a sober state can access them and no body else. 
Store it in a particular pattern if you wish that only you know. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:18:06
I’m glad you moved it to segwit. 
That’s because segwit and legacy are processed on the same network which is currently clogged. 
So when there is more segwit adoptions specially from these assholes at coinbase and blockchain.info
Then the network clog will be cleared making the transaction fee lower. 
Coinbase and blockchain.info are Rogers puppets and they want to destroy bitcoin to make their forked coin more valuable. Which I don’t blame them for because it’s pure business which I like to call creation of PayPal 2.0. Everyone looks at their net worth not the other persons. 
So if you have your coins on legacy keep it at legacy and don’t move it but make sure the next transaction you ever do is a Segwit transaction, that is to pay someone or send it to and from exchanges. Make sure the exchange or the person you are sending your coins to and from is using a segwit address not a legacy address. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:14:29
Can’t say, they both vary I usually check both places and what offers a good rate I go with that. There are also times that shapeshift does not have the coins you want o exchange to.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:55:29
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:57:15
I sent transactions with 0.25 fees from ledger and exodus does not allow to change fees so the default is about $9.

You can sell your coins and convert it to fiat with quardrigaCX in Canada. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:54:28
Yea, it’s pretty good. I use it often to sell my crypto

It did actually got 10 for a few seconds and this happened for the 2nd time. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:26:05
The hopes !
Honestly I think the correction after the segwit2X fork it will just bring it around $6200ish not low 5000 but again I can be wrong this number is from my understanding 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:18:23
QuardrigaCX should allow but before making such transactions I would recommend you get in contact with the exchange and notify them you are sending in that amount. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:17:28
Yea, I watched a video on YouTube on how to do that. 
Thank you :))
