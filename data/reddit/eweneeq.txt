My dad is 79.  A couple of years ago, my brother, sister and dad met at an AirBNB in the mountains for a weekend reunion. 
Each family's share of the cost was $100. My dad made the reservation and told me I could pay him when we arrived (a couple of months later). 
I jokingly asked if he accepted Bitcoin for payment. He laughed and said he didn't understand.
I told him that I'd make him a proposition. I'd buy $100 in Bitcoin that day and when I saw him, I'd give him the choice of $100 cash or he could take the Bitcoin at it's current value.
Well, Bitcoin shot up. While we were at the cabin, it hit $6,000 for the first time. And, he was hooked.
He's added another $500 over time, and even with the current dip, his $600 is now worth $1200.
Most importantly, it has given us fodder for hours of conversation in the meantime.  Priceless!

Thank. I'll give it a shot. XPUB was still in the works the last time I played with it (some time ago). I'll try again.
I guess I'm more trying to understand tools and blockchain mechanics.
As long as I know my retirement BTC is still in its proper place, I can play around with various tools.
Thanks for the help!

Thanks. That didn't seem to work. I had tried that before, albeit by pasting in the search box rather than the address bar.
I sent myself some BTC from one wallet to the other and the balances in Mycelium incremented/decremented appropriately. But still don't see the tx reflected in 3rd party tools.
I'll keep playing. Just a bit of a shock when you casually check a balance and see zero. But, as I said, the wallet app shows correctly.
Thanks for the help.
