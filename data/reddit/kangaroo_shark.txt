Curious how did you get scammed twice?
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:19:26
I've used Kucoin in the past, I never had any issues.

80% to Bitcoin?? Lol... Ramon takes up nearly 20% of my paycheck. I didn't need this poor reminder to start my weekend.

I knew I didn't like you for some reason, thank you for clarifying why.

First buy a magic 8 ball. (I'm sure you can find one on eBay.)
Second ask magic 8 ball if now is a good time to buy.
Thirdly keep asking magic 8 ball until you're satisfied with the answer.
Coinbase is an easy way to purchase Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and or Litecoin.

At least you're not defacing US currency otherwise it could be considered a crime.
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:06:25
I would but I don't want to upset my current Bitcoin supplier, he's the Prince of Nigeria. If you send me half I can forward you an email from him with all his contact info.

Sounds legit.

Someone once said the Titanic was unsinkable, didn't end well for Leonardo DiCaprio.

Pretty sweet right turn arrow you photographed in the wild.

I knew I'd regret replying to this post. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 02:35:50
Great question, I don't know but if I can't find one soon I have no reason to get outta bed in the morning.
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:04:14
That's cool man, congrats. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:34:44
Thank you. This is awesome. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:47:41
Haha. Nice.

Not true. I got in around October 2017, I really like the idea of using crypto as payments. I think it has a great future. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:58:32
Instead of buying Bitcoin maybe you should move outta your mother in-laws basement. Just a thought.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:58:20
I guess I'd hold her, I mean yeah I'd damn near puke but I'd take one for the team.
Y'all owe me.

Some ass clown chopped up an Eminem diss track aimed at MGK to make it about crypto. Ass clowns don't have logic.

Why are you hanging around a Chuck E. Cheese with a camera ready?
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:55:45
That didn't make sense to me either. I thought I was the only one that noticed that after skimming through the comments.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:33:52
I'll buy it from you for 100 so you don't lose all 500.
Seriously though. Good. Now is a good time to buy. I just bought some too. I'll exchange it for something different soon though. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:26:41
Sounds hot.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:55:33
Please try again. Your rationalized state of mind isn't welcomed here. Can you believe this clown and his logical way.

Is this a test, seems like an essay test.

Nothing is free in this world.

Now I miss living in downtown San Diego. Nice though. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 00:20:38
I'm leaving my family instructions about my nano s &amp; how to access all my wallets. What they don't know, I'm leaving them a nano s I never used (besides setting it up). 
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:33:30
From what I've read it can hold a larger variety of currencies. Depending on the currency you're looking to buy would determine which type of wallet you should have.
