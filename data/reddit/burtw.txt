Federal Criminal Case Against Burt Wagner Dismissed
at the Request of the Department of Justice
July13, 2015
I am very excited to announce that the criminal case against my client Burt Wagner was dismissed today. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado filed a motion earlier today requesting that the U.S. District Court Judge handling the case, the Honorable William J. Martinez, dismiss the case against Mr. Wagner. Judge Martinez subsequently issued an order dismissing it.
On October 7, 2014, Mr. Wagner was charged in a single-count indictment with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1960 (operation of unlicensed money transmitting business) in connection with his purchases and sales of bitcoins. Mr. Wagner entered a plea of not guilty. Although Mr. Wagner and I both wish he had never been charged, we appreciate the U.S. Attorney's Office ultimately doing the right thing and dismissing the criminal case against him.
With this dismissal, Mr. Wagner can begin the process of resuming his regular life. It has been a true privilege to represent Mr. Wagner. I could not be happier for him and his family.

The best video we have found to understand just how bad civil asset forfeiture has gotten.  Please watch the entire video, it is very entertaining and sad:
