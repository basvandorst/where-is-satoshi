I think you're trying to make the argument that certain crypto technologies became widely used in the 90s, such as SSL, and that the mainstream user wasn't aware of it's use. 
Since I replied to a thread citing 'Crypto Anarchy and Virtual Communities' I would have thought we all would have been using that definition of crypto anarchy. What Timothy May describes has never happened on that imagined scale before, one of the key missing components was anonymous digital cash.
A crypto anarchy needs anonymous digital cash to conduct commerce.
I hope I'm wrong about Bitcoin not going mainstream, but I think people fail to see the big elephant in the room in that Bitcoin's value flows from being able to do things that fiat systems can't do; because those things are what the state does not want to be able to do.

Read the third last paragraph.

Ok going to assume you're an actual noob and not a troll.
Bitcoin Cash a.k.a Bcash for short is a fork of Bitcoin proper. A fork of a cryptocurrency is different to a fork of a open source software project because you are not only forking the software but also the blockchain history. What that means is that Bcash is a copy and then modification of the original Bitcoin software but the two coins actually share the same blockchain history up to a point a few months ago. This is different to a full on altcoin which does not share any ledger history. 
Bcash changed a number of things from Bitcoin, the main difference being the blocksize. Bcash has a max blocksize of 8MB, whereas Bitcoin at the time of the fork had a max blocksize of 1MB. Since then Bitcoin has undergone an upgrade called SegWit which has raised the max blocksize to around 4MB but typically more like 2MB. 
So today, Bcash has a bigger simple blocksize and Bitcoin has SegWit which is a blocksize *and* sort of architecture redesign. SegWit is not only an upgrade of Bitcoin itself but a platform for a plethora of upgrades. For example Schnorr Signatures and I believe even MAST can be soft forked into Bitcoin and will be. 
I do not recommend Bcash for the following reasons.
1. It has centralized governance. Which is why changes can be made so easily.
2. It has centralized mining  (as predicted by the "small" blockers). 
3. It has centralized nodes (as predicted by the "small" blockers).
4. Because of points 1-3 it's centralized enough that you know who's doors to kick down to shut it off completely.
5. It has no technical future due to not adopting SegWit.
6. The 8MB blocksize is proving to be an inadequte scaling "solution" and slippery slope as they are planning another increase (as predicted by the "small" blockers) aggravating the problems of points 1-3.
7. No lightning implementations will work with Bcash due to them expecting SegWit.
8. The community as a whole matches some definitions of a cult.
9. The promotion of Bcash has used malicious marketing tactics that have not only tricked noobs but lost real money.
10. Bcash along with other forks are going to bad for long term speculation due to the fact that Bitcoin whales before the fork can dump at anytime.

@_date: 2018-01-14 05:21:27


blocks *are* larger than 1Mb dummy, with high SegWit usage they'd be over 2Mb, as we saw with Coinbase's recent fuck up a blocksize increase is not required, just big companies adopting latest scaling tech, unless you want to bail out Coinbase for it's incompetence/malice; same goes for BitPay and Blockchain.info


It's working right now without larger blocks, INB4 133Mb meme, as I said with schnorr and MAST and especially channel factories you might never need a blocksize increase, hell channel factories could do this by itself!


Yes it is incompatible, eclair won't work with it, c-lightning won't work etc... NONE, 0, zlich or the lightning implementations work.
A Bcash lightning network is dare I say...
 


The whole point of Bcash was to not have the use lightning because it was "evil" and "centralized" and not "Satoshi's Vision™", now they're going to adopt it, in the words of Fake Satoshi "PISS OFF!"

Reference Bitcoin client (Core) will require you run a lightning implementation of your choosing. This is due the their minimalistic design philosophy as the reference client. 
However as we've seen with other features and technologies, non-reference wallets will almost certainly consolidate and integrate lightning nodes into their existing wallet software. End users and normies will not know the difference, it will just be address and send; except now confirmations will be instant and fees will be almost nothing.

That's actually a pretty pessimistic view of the future of Bitcoin as what he is describing would inject trusted third parties back into Bitcoin, thereby making the entire exercise pointless.
While it's certainty true that broadcasting every single transaction to every single node that is and will be in the future dosen't scale (a flood network), we don't need to sacrifice the trustless nature of Bitcoin to deploy a routing network such as the lightning network to leverage the blockchain. 
Bitcoin has evolved and is evolving even in these short few years.

Technically he's not wrong, but it's kind of an all or nothing idealism. I'm happy with a temporary transition compromise of using SegWit to lower fees, **provided we are going the right direction**.

@_date: 2018-01-09 11:54:45


Because companies aren't doing shit to support SegWit. That's like if the blocksize was increased but miners didn't actually mine any blocks above 1MB and then some fucking retard on reddit says "well increasing the blocksize didn't do shit to reduce fees, can't we just admit we were wrong herp a derp"
LN is a method not a product, it's already being used on the mainnet with real bitcoin thanks to TorGuard which I believe is the first merchant, developers have already done their part, now merchants simply need to support lightning.
So much for "hurr durr vaporware" or "hurr durr it's going to take 2 years".
The ball is completely in the merchant and users court. Developers did their bit already.

Bcash is planning to go to 32Mb blocks and lightning nodes are planned to be implemented in end user wallet software. You do the math.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:18:01
Everyone wants a capacity increase. The debate is on how to do it and who pays for that increased capacity. The method Ver wants to use is by far the least efficient one and pushes costs onto full node operators which are the heart of what make Bitcoin decentralized, which is the heart of what make Bitcoin valuable. 
When I say "they" in this context I'm clearly referring to the subject of the OP, i.e. "companies not adopting SegWit". When users rejected the S2X hard fork it made them all look like idiots because they claimed it had OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS™, now they want to make users and developers look like idiots by aggravating mempool congestion problem. 
If SegWit was fully adopted at current usage the mempool would be completely cleared and fees would be in the cents range again.

The blockchain with the smallest transactions is the most scalable... and that's SegWit activated Bitcoin, this is why it's superior to even Monero.

Interesting, an unconventional view about price inflation in Bitcoin. I wonder what argument(s) will be made to predict price inflation in a currency that was deliberately designed designed to NOT have price inflation or devaluation due to its deterministic new supply that is halved every four years.


What in the actual fuck? Cost changing and salary increases are the *result* of inflation not the cause.

That's part of it. Miner centralization would definitely be problematic. But it's actually been much worse than it is now. If it ever got really bad a few developers have talked about changing the mining algorithm which would instantly render all mining hardware useless. 
I'm far more worried about node centralization to be honest, and when we talk about centralization this is what we're mainly referring to. If nodes are centralized into data centers instead of being run in peoples' own garages or on bookshelfs then it's game over.

It's still the ridiculously inefficient authoritarian collectivism that is big government. 
UBI could work better as a replacement for welfare not as a supplement, like Milton Friedman's negative income tax idea and Yang kind of hinted at this as being the ideal. Still pretty retarded and suppress the survival drive in humans bringing out the worst in us, but it was really his beliefs on the future centralization of technological innovation that pissed me off.

Yes, the implication is that fees are being artificailly driven up so that noobs will support the big blocks narrative. The end goal is stop users from being able to run full nodes because bigger block eventually make this impossible, the end game is that bitcoin is centralized in data centers and now you can censor transactions, reverse transactions, block transactions, require KYC/AML, even increase the 21 million coin cap.

Do more or less people use Bitcoin than gold/silver?
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:53:19
Because if you want smaller fees (or better yet, no fees) and instant transactions you can just use paypal, these aren't the things that make Bitcoin special, useful and valuable.
What really matters is that there is no one's door you can kick down if you want to censor transactions, reverse transactions or even inflate the money supply.
Full nodes verify that these rules such as these have been obeyed, and if you make blocks big enough you can imprison all full nodes into corporate data centers. This kills the Bitcoin and ruins its unique value.
The Bitcoin developers we have now have been talking about this stuff since at least 2012, they are the champions of decentralization and that is why I trust Bitcoin over other coins, because the developers have the best understanding and best plan to not only scale Bitcoin but keep it decentralized at the same time.

No SegWit is a technology that allows special transactions that are cheaper than normal among other technical benefits.

If you're not running a full node, YOU ARE NOT A PEER. But rather relying on a peer (some company's full node) to verify the ledger for you; you don't even have a copy of the ledger, because "hurr durr that's not important".
With lightning you can still be a peer because blocks are still lean and can move quickly across the network, in a big block scenario, blocks are too bloated to be run in anything but coporate cloud data centers with a tier 1 backbone connection. That is as centralized as you can get, that's big blocks not lightning, you don't even know what you're talking about, just regurgitating low info propaganda you've been told by big blockers.

No it won't, bigger blocks leads to centralize bitcoin because only centralized entities will be able to run full nodes. With lightning every wallet can be a lightning node, everyone will have the ability to not only have a copy of the ledger by the ability to self verify it and not have to trust a third party.
Bigger blocks forces you to rely on trusted third parties. You have no choice because the system is no longer lean and nimble.

Actually increasing the blocksize to reduce fees literally just pushes the cost of transaction onto the full node operators. People running the full nodes foot the bill for and subsidize your transaction fees.
That's why "muh artificial limit" dosen't really make sense, it's more of a balance variable between transactors and full node operators.

Start using SegWit up until blocks get to 2MB then we can talk.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:32:30
real answer here: that block is due to 1-2 sat/B transactions being added to the graph, originally it was just 1-5 sat/B being shown which is why it suddenly jumps up late Novemer.
still looks like a spam attack to me though with a metric fuck ton of low fee transactions pumped into the mempool, it's systematic to keep pushing wallets into higher and higher estimatations, the drop off at the end is the spam attack being pulled

Technically Lightning transactions can be done right now as they are just an abstraction of smart contract transactions. 
The wait is for end user software that polished and tested enough (since this is billions of other peoples' money) to be released.

I like Monero, espcially for it's unique codebase but even flufflypony acknowledges that transactions sizes are too fucking big, scales much worse than bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:24:27
we need to decouple the relationship between block space and transaction cost, as long as this relationship exists Bitcoin will never be able to scale *and* keep it's decentralized properties (and hence it's value).
lightning can do this, it's the least bit elusive, lightning transactions have already been done on mainnet as they are just smart contracts at the end of the day
other technologies like schnorr signatures and MAST will give up more transactions for the same amount of blockspace 
there's also mimblewimble done as an extension block... really there are so many better approaches than an irreversible block size increase by hard fork shit storm, there is literally no worse way of "scaling" bitcoin than a blocksize increase. That's why it's all the way at the end of the queue

if it's unconfirmed you can try double spending it with a much higher fee
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:29:56
The purposing of holding is to eventually spend, otherwise there is no point to holding in the first place.
The incentive to spend a deflationary currency is survival in the present. I know this from experience as to many others on this sub if you read their stories. 
Criticisms of a deflationary currency make no logical goddamn sense.
If anything an inflationary currency gives an artificial incentive to spend before the value of currency is eroded. You can see very obvious examples of this in Venezuela today.

I'm not following lightning dev that much but I think like sometime first half 2018, but because lightning is second layer it necessarily is being developed as fast as humanly possible. All 2nd layer solutions do not need permission from the 1st layer (Bitcoin Core / the blockchain) in order to innovate and build.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:46:37
Lightning is already written and in the testing phase of the software development life cycle. Therefore it does not meet the definition of vapourware which is software that is not available because it is not yet written but the company refuses to officially cancel it. 
But I guess that dosen't go with the Bcash narrative.

Bitcoin is intended to be fungible and private, although it's still waiting for additional upgrades to perfect these properties. Although in it's current form it's pretty good for money laundering, which is good not because we want to indulge in criminality, but because we want to protect ourselves from the inherent criminality of the state.
I don't think it's a big deal because the largest money launderers are already big banks like HSBC, what they are able to launder pales in comparison to what an individual using the Bitcoin network could do.
In terms of your tax money, pretty much none of it is used for community programs that you may or may not consent to, but rather to pay off debt to the treasury and the federal reserve exchanging IOUs.

Bitcoin is peer-to-peer digital cash without trusted third parties. If you raise the blocksize significantly then normal peers will not have the resources to be able to self verify the blockchain and will instead need to rely on trusted 3rd parties to verify the rules of Bitcoin have been followed. Rules like there are only ever 21 million Bitcoins or transactions can't be censored.
So a sufficiently large enough blocksize would turn Bitcoin into datacenter-to-datacenter regulated credits with trusted third parties a.k.a. [PayPal 2.0](

You do realise that many of the same encryption technologies that are used in Bitcoin are used in modern banking.

I would prefer not to have to use a nuclear weapon.
However don't you think it's prudent to have one that is in silo ready to launch, as from what I've read 51% attacks have hit altcoins quite swiftly. The MAD may also act as a deterrent to an otherwise braver malicious actor.

Really you need SegWit for a proper sidechains implementation so that both sides could use the same 21M coins.

Sounds good. Once SegWit is enabled the scaling of signature hashing will be linear instead of quadratic making bigger blocks much safer to implement.
Only problem is you don't get to decide, a handful of miner pool owners in a single country do.

Hard forks are like undergoing a potentially life threatening operation.
If they are not necessary to fix the health issue, first try other modalities. 
If it looks like it must be done, plan out everything, schedule appointments take blood samples etc... and then hire a skill surgeon to perform the operation.
If however there is a emergency which itself is life threatening (got hit by a Chinese mining truck), call 911 and get rushed to the emergency room. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:48:09
why don't we activate segwit first? it's already coded and tested and fixes the quadratic sighash problem which is essential for increasing the blocksize limit safely

SegWit gives them 2MB, that's why it prioritized and is now already part of the core client code.
Hard forks are "serious business". They need to be tested first and then their deployment planned, not like the Leeroy Jenkins shit show we've been seeing from BU lately. The exception to this is of course emergency threats and fixes.
We'd need to testnet SegWit + an additional blocksize doubling (4MB is what you're asking for) and let run for a few months and then maybe an additional 6-12 month period to give all clients a reasonable chance to upgrade.
Or we can just activate SegWit right now and spend the same or even shorter time for the additional blocksize hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:04:34
It's meant to be separation of powers.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:11:15

Increasing the block size would be a scaling solution if Bitcoin scaled at (O)n or better. 
The unfortunate reality is that Bitcoin scales at (O)n^2, so increasing the block size makes the problem exponentially worse until the system collapses under it's own weight. As such I can't in good conscience use the word "solution" when referring to BU.

SegWit must come **before** any further blocksize increase because it solves the quadratic sighash problem.
Once we have SegWit deployed it will give us the time and technical platform to plan and deploy further blocksize increase. 
Cramming them through at the same time is not only reckless (but then again that's BU's style as we've seen) but goddamn retarded.

Centralized data centers fit into a client-server model architecture. Data centers house servers, that's kind of the point of them.
P2P architecture is diametrically opposed to client-server.

It's not the least bit complicated, it's basically a simple relocate of transaction signatures and bug fixes.
Sure any fork is risky, that's why SegWit is a compromise. But the idea that a hard fork (a fucking hard fork!) is less dangerous than a backward compatible soft fork is laughable. When people suggest this it's shady and wrecks of goal post shifting.

Hard forks are like life threatening heart surgery. We only do them if we have exhausted all other avenues like soft forks.
If you do need heart surgery, you plan for it, you schedule appointments, get blood samples etc... which takes months. Of course you may also have been hit by a Chinese mining truck and have been rushed to the emergency room for a heart transplant (PoW change).


Let's see it on testnet. Would give heavy credibility to your position. The difference between 1MB and 2MB is actually staggering in terms of verification times.

I thought it would be over (at least this round/iteration) with the recent BU node bug fuck up (reminiscent of XT and Classic fuck ups) and miners would finally start signalling SegWit, then we could have got Schnorr working and then increase the blocksize further.
But this time we have the Chinese mining cartel threatening a hardfork.
I don't think it's ever going to stop until SegWit is deployed via UASF or the miner coup hardfork is attempted and countered with PoWC or maybe milder PoWA scenario.
So maybe speculate on the timeline of UASF and how PoWC/A proposals progress within the coming days. USAF may take months, a hostile hardfork could come at any time which it why we need to start preparing right now.

That's a more of a threat than anything else. Do you know why many governments of the world do not negotiate with terrorists?
Compromise is a two way street. What we would need to move forward with SegWit + 2MB as a hardfork would be proof, technical evidence that is it very safe and does not compromise any decentralization.
If big blocks scale so well with a quadratic function, simply prove it. Show use there a zero problems with it, let's see a 4MB-8MB testnet.
It's not asking for much is it?
Or we can just deploy SegWit now which we already deployed on the testnet and sort this out later as the price goes up.

My guesses:
* Price drops under $600, miners shit themselves and signal SegWit (a few weeks at this rate).
* UASF is organized by us the users, activating SegWit (a few months).
* UASF is organized, miners see the wind change and signal SegWit to save face (weeks or months).
* BU tries Peter R's 51% attack and gets blown the fuck out by quickly coded PoW change to SHA3 (weeks or months).

Then he is shooting himself in the foot. Increasing the block size without optimizations sacrifices decentralization. Decentralization is the underlying factor that  ultimately gives Bitcoin utility/value. This is like building a taller building by using bricks from your foundation.


It *is* complicated. It's not a simple: big block *derp*, big user *herp*, big price *durrr*.


You realize that part of his salary are locked bitcoins. 
At the end of the day, everyone cares about the price and no one cares about the block size. Just let me be able to run a full node myself and not trust a 3rd party to verify the consensus rules for me.

Interesting question. We've seen previous e-cash systems quickly destroyed by the US and other governments. Although all of these systems relied on centralized servers.
I think they understand that they will have as much luck shutting down Bitcoin as the had shutting down Bittorrent, as such I see the attack being a "soft" attack via co-opting and centralizing Bitcoin. I also think social engineering attacks are the more potent to use against the system as even if the system is technologically perfect there is always a human factor.

Originally there was a 32MB limit, but blocks weren't even close to 100KB. So we don't have any data on the effects of 32MB blocks, so you can't assume it would work because you don't actually fucking know.
What we do know is that with the latest optimizations added to Bitcoin was the only reason it was able to handle the 1MB blocks we have now. According to BitFury when you go to 8MB blocks 95% of the nodes drop off the network within 6 months (this kills the Bitcoin), they have a hypothesis and data. Now go an disprove it with a 8MB proof of concept test net. 


You do run it, but not in fucking production! You run a test network like what we did with both SegWit AND Lightning.
It's called a "Proof of Concept". This isn't hobbyist shit any more, it's a multi-billion dollar network of other people's money.

@_date: 2017-08-20 07:30:33
So basically the same idea as Litecoin, Feathercoin and Dogecoin. 
Still massive tax on full nodes when blocks inevitably full again due to the law of induced demand. The only good solutions to scalability problems are algorithmic optimizations (e.g. SegWit, Schnorr, MAST) and leverage (e.g. Lightning, Payment Channels, Sidechains).
Increasing the blocksize just induces demand exponentially as well and the resource cost for full nodes exponentially. There is literally no stupider way to approach the problem.

I can't think of anything you can't do with a side chain. It's better than a hard fork because they no giant mess like what we are seeing and everyone uses the same 21 million coins that can cross back and forth between chains that have the rules that they want.
So for example in an ideal world Bcash would have been a big block side chain and we would all be united. Which is what our devs suggested with drive chains before the split.

Bitcoin is P2P digital cash without a trusted 3rd party. What makes Bitcoin better than a fiat bank is not convenience. We can easily create a system that has *instant* confirmations with trusted 3rd parties.


Network will not come to a halt. That's like saying no one ever goes to that restaurant because it's too busy. Less meaningful transactions will simply be price out.
Small blockers see Bitcoin failing when the individual is no longer able to operate a full node. At that point it fails to be P2P digital cash without a trusted 3rd party.


Already been proposed. The problems are things like the quadratic scaling of signature hashing, which makes big blocks hilariously impractical. Algorithm scaling is literally Computer Science 101 (or maybe 102). If these problems can be solved no one cares how big blocks are.

SegWit is bigger blocks, and then once other optimizations are implemented and it is safe, further block size increase will occur.
This is all a grudge against the core devs and that they're not rich yet, seriously it's madness, they want to risk billions of dollars of other peoples' money due to a grudge.

Ok, so I watched this debate. 
The most eye brow raising part for me was Roger continually repeating "We've got empirical evidence for the last 8 years!"... I don't even. During those 8 years we haven't had blocks larger than 1MB, how can that be used as evidence for bigger blocks?
All you need to convince the developers (including Luke) to increase the blocksize is a fucking proof of concept or testnet where full 8-16-32 MB blocks are being mined and consumer hardware and internet user nodes are functioning without much tax. That's it. Of course, spoiler: you can't do that and the developers know this which is why we're here.
I liked Richard steelmanning Roger's position at the start, but he should have got Roger to do the same for him, would have got to some better contention points.

SegWit was the compromise. If look back Core wanted to implement other improvements first, but when SegWit was seen to be a safer way to increase the blocksize focus was shifted to mostly SegWit development.


I guess it still is early days, but I'm beginning to lose optimism in cooperation. I think a secession HF with SegWit + Keccak is more likely. SegWit was the gift made specially for the big blockers to meet their stated desire of more transaction capacity. When it is rejected there's going to be anger. Corexit.

Yep, if we switch to Keccak mining will eventually re-centralize to China when new ASICs are developed (or maybe we can manufacture them for a test net now to beat them to the punch) but we will enjoy a year or two of a new Bitcoin Golden Age. Bitcoin needs more time to grow. By the time it re-centralizes we'll have SegWit, Lightning, Confidential Transactions, maybe even a Zero Cash.

Back then the demographics of Bitcoin were homogeneous. Cypher punks, libertarians and gold bugs were all on board with the awesome magic of Bitcoin's decentralization, inflation immunity and higher privacy. 
Now we have hoards of mainstream immigrants that are looking to get rich quick and think that the government is just here to help. They don't necessarily care about decentralization, fungibility or financial privacy. 
They just want adoption at all costs even if that means sacrificing what makes Bitcoin unique (and ultimately derives it's value from) and getting in bed with regulators because they expected to be super rich and important by now.
This was inevitable and anyone is welcome to use Bitcoin. But we need there needs to be constant education as to *why* we need digital cash without trusted 3rd parties.

@_date: 2016-12-15 04:04:46
One of the big ones for me is that Bitcoin is one of the only things left you can actually really own i.e. allodium. 
You don't really own your savings in the bank. The bank can seize your funds at any time without your permission. Even if you keep cash under the bed the buying power of that cash can be siphoned off via inflation. 
You don't really own any property you have the title for. Stop paying your property taxes and see what happens.
You don't even really own your pay check. Money from that goes to pay for the fancy dinners of corrupt politicians, kill people in other countries that are not your enemy and to your ex-wife.
With bitcoin I actually really own it. I don't even need to use violence to defend it.
Allodium ownership of wealth, inflation proof store of wealth, these are things that I think Bitcoin currently solves. You can enslave entire populations with wealth confiscation and inflation. 
I think there were other things it was intended to solve as well, like if you look at Timothy May's Crypto Anarchy and Wei Dai's B-money which it currently fails to solve due to privacy issues.
Great questions, hard to answer because there's a ton of implications.

I get it, you want Bitcoin to succeed and you see an increased market cap as success. However if we compromise Bitcoin's ability to resist state control we will get neither security nor market cap. Can you see how this could be self-defeating for market cap?
Ultimately Bitcoin has utility and thus value because it allows you to do things that the state does not want you to be able to do. Donate to wikileaks, resist taxation via inflation etc.. "Swiss bank account in your pocket" - Obama
If a handful of corporations physically control Bitcoin what's to stop a powerful state from turning it into a ponzi scheme? Do you see the problem here?

There's vitriol in almost any internet forums. But I think most threads are quite productive. Also a lot of people also misinterpret humor and inside jokes as vitriol and need to take a deep breath and stay objective. 


There is no objective reason to exclude the possibility of malicious actors. We've seen some many scandals and frauds in crypto. Many of which are targeted at the heart of what makes Bitcoin special which are it's privacy and decentralized properties.

It's the only one that *can* be widely used due to it's lower footprint and transaction size.

Sure, this is really no different from a leveraged long trade. 
The big caveat of course is that I would also have a well paying job that I enjoy working at and my life was also low stress in general. 
Back in the Mt Gox era I maxed out my credit card and took out a loan to get cash to buy as much bitcoin as quickly as possible. I would have been fine as I could easily spend half my income in paying down any debts.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to not trust third parties. If you don't run your own node you are forced to trust a third party (someone else's full node that you connect to).
Your node verifies some pretty important rules have been followed like: "Does the bitcoin I received actually exist?" or "There can only be 21M bitcoins." Not using your own node not only defeats the whole point of the Bitcoin experiment but also opens you up for different attacks.

Sure, maybe a benevolent billionaire could buy a data center. Maybe he is also able to purchase a license to run a Bitcoin node, which he is able to keep because he verifies the consensus rules in accordance with the guidelines.
But what if **I myself** don't have enough capital to run a node, I would then have to trust that elite node operator's verification of the consensus rules.
If you are interested to know more I believe Adam Back and Peter Todd talk about more of these failure modes.
Ultimately I don't think this is a path we need to even go down, the developers are working on optimizations and additional layers to the Bitcoin stack that will allow for the demands of users and businesses while still allowing Bitcoin to remain Bitcoin by allowing individuals to verify the consensus rules on a full node they can trust because they physically control it.

If all personal Bitcoin nodes needed to be run in corporate data centers due to needing backbone fiber connections and enterprise level hardware in order to function. Bitcoin would have a significantly lower value proposition in my mind. 
It would be much easier to implement top down control of the network by the state. What if transactions could be reversed? How would Bitcoin still be digital *cash*? If all you care about is the price, this is like the main value proposition of Bitcoin.

It's not only the ability to get access to low interest loans, it's the ability to get access to loans that really shouldn't be offered at all. That's what happened with the global financial crisis of 2008. 
People take on these insane loans because they keep seeing the real estate market go up year after year and FOMO in. Works fantastic if you're not the last one in the door. I know in Australia and New Zealand the market appears to have topped out two years ago and people who bought around then have already in the red. Canada I believe is pretty much at the same stage.

I used to have a similar plan. Use Bitcoin's insane capital gains to then go and buy income producing assets like residential real estate and dividend stocks.
The only problem since getting involved in Bitcoin I've learned so much about the financial system that I've come to learn that residential real estate in 1st world capital cities (which I'm assuming your looking at investing in due to the currency you mentioned) most of the price is due to the availability of credit at artificially low interest rates. 
Historically  a home was worth 3x of a person's annual income, because that's what was affordable with a natural credit environment (many people of course would just save for a house at that price). Now in some capital cities a home can be as much as 18x the average annual income. That's a long way down when it drops. It's basically a giant credit ponzi scheme.
If you have a look at previous housing market collapses like Japan, Ireland, Iceland etc... you can get as high as 80% corrections. The UK (especially London) is headed this way, along with Commonwealth capital cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Vancouver, Toronto etc... In the US you've got San Fran among others. Say goodbye to your passive income when that happens. 
Long story short, residential real estate is actually a really over rated investment and it's about the time in the cycle for normies and noobs to get rekt and wiped out. Being saturated in Bitcoin markets everyday has made this way more clearer to me. Similar goes for stocks as well, they are pumped up way higher than they should be with cheap credit and at some point in the future I expect a massive correction.
If you want to invest in real estate you need to treat it like a business in my opinion. Find real problems or inefficiencies to fix, if you want to buy something and forget best buy at the bottom of a market that has already been wiped out. Or an emerging economy, I hear places like Georgia and Cambodia give terrific rental yields (like 10%+) with further capital growth. With stocks it's the same, I wouldn't go for an index I'd select specific companies I researched would do less bad in a recession.
tl;dr -- Traditional asset classes are all rigged and fake as fuck credit ponzi scams and Bitcoin is likely the only thing that will be standing by the end

The difference is I physically control it. Even though I'm not the manufacturer I can verify that parts of it are doing what they should be. 
Just like if I owned a car I can observe the operation of the engine, I know it's using the fuel from the tank and giving power to the axel.
Even if my machine's CPU is backdoored by the NSA (i.e. intel managment engine) I still have a measure of control because I have the most fundamental level of control, physical control.

Yeah, it's has the benefits of higher tps with none of the downsides of full node and network tax. That's why Core is leaving the worse solution for last.
Optimizing algorithms is actually the heart of scaling in computer science. Increasing the blocksize is just throwing more resources at a O(n^2) problem making it worse with every new element in the array.

SegWit definitely helps, but the main reason fees are low (other than being in a quiet period) is because big bitcoin companies are now simply batching transactions. I remember back in the day when Coinbase went down and the mempool plunged. 
What we really need next is major exchanges and major merchants using lightning. I notice many smaller exchanges and merchants have switched over already but the major players are dragging their feet to even just adopt SegWit.
For merchants it's pretty easy, just stop using BitPay and using BTCPay or Coingate. For the largest exchanges however are dragging their feet even to upgrade to use just SegWit. Now maybe it's harder for them to update their systems than a smaller exchange but this shit is critical if we want the largest bull run possible. They upgrade quickly and easily for shitcoin integration and other projects.

Microsoft could just release a "critical security" update to keylog people's passphrases, leak unencrypted private keys in RAM and/or just halt the Bitcoin network altogether after a phone call from the government.

Trump has stake in GBTC, wants to return to the gold standard but doesn't think it's possible in today's system, wants to audit the fed and hates the fact that China manipulates their currency whereas Bitcoin has fixed supply.
One things for sure Trump's movement is not going away if he loses, the anger and energy is nothing like I've ever seen. Bitcoin as a form of exiting the system is going to become very appealing. People won't want their tax dollars funding war with Syria/Russia and subsidizing illegals' welfare.

What are you trying to achieve? Unless you're doing something with the land it's not going to produce any income. Quite the opposite, land does nothing but eat with land taxes and whatever other ongoing costs. 
I guess you might be able to rent out the land to farmers or maybe homesteaders or something. I don't know if there's a market for that.
If you're just looking to use it as a store of value I guess it's price change would be less volatile in a recession and if the world really goes to hell you could always start your own homestead on it. 
Not saying I'm not a fan but you got to have a plan. One day I hope to buy a ton of acreage even if it's just to fuck around with.

On average I load up 4 gift cards every month with less than a $1 fee and that's just because I'm impatient. Easily could just wait for the mempool to clear and pay a few cents. If you're paying $8 I don't know what the fuck you're doing.
I use the cards to buy all my groceries, fuel and even things like electronics. So at the moment it's working pretty good for me for everyday payments. I hardly ever use cash or cards anymore.
I don't expect this to continue forever, eventually fees will be x10 more and that will be annoying but still workable. When it becomes x100 more that's when it will become impractical. But by then merchants will at least all be using Lightning, on top other innovations like maybe a mimble wimble extension block, a big block sidechain. Many great ideas so who knows. Fee pressure will cause the free market to come up with some solution on top as another layer just like with the development of the internet.

In the very early days of Bitcoin, the expectation was that even 1st world governments would quickly ban it and that you would have to acquire Bitcoin by trading it in person for cash or earning it by selling a good or service.

Historically altcoins have been a terrible hedge against Bitcoin. If altcoins were a good hedge then stable coins probably wouldn't be needed. You could just keep an altcoin portfolio and achieve pretty much the same thing averaged out.
Due to their even lower liquidity than the super low liquidity of bitcoin (only $150B) altcoins behave more like leveraged derivatives of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes up, altcoins tend to shoot up even more percentage wise, but when Bitcoin goes down, altcoins plummet even further. 
The first generation of altcoins like Litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, Freicoin were more purpose driven and much less centralized and gimmicky. Back then you couldn't hide behind technical jargon and "Bitcoin 2.0" concepts because most of the community were crypto experts and could see through shit like Superman's heat vision. But somewhere along the line people realized that if you create a new coin you can suck a lot of capital into it in a very short amount of time and be financially set for life. Thus the "shitcoin" was born as developers were looking for any excuse (and I mean ANY excuse) to create a new token. Some projects even have two or three coins just to solve one problem that dosen't actually need to be solved.
Pretty much all of today's top 20 are centralized in the sense that you would only need to make a few phone calls to some data centers or at best kick down a small number of doors to shut them down. They are technical messes trying to outshine the simple elegance and lean design of Bitcoin with bloated feature sets to solve non-problems, and from a technical decentralized scaling perspective are doomed unless they are streamlined to be lean and somehow removed from the data center. 
My hope is that once a few sidechains get released people will realize that the Shitcoin Emperor has no clothes.

If you want to manage the risk of potentially losing money from Bitcoin going down in price, what you can do is "dollar cost average".
Basically buy a set amount every week, fortnight or month. If the price goes up, great you've made some money. If it stays the same, good you're saving money (you were going to spend it on stupid shit anyway), if it goes down, still good you're getting more bitcoin for the same amount of money increasing your stack faster.

Scaling advancements can all be done without the need of a hard fork, but rather "opt in" backwards compatible soft forks (like SegWit was). 
Hard forks are fucking stupid when you have soft fork scaling solutions that optimize Bitcoin, keeping the blocks small, lean and agile. 
Schnorr signatures, MAST, MimbleWimble via extension blocks. This is Bitcoin 2.0 stuff that is vastly preferable over a Neanderthal blocksize increase via a hard fork shit storm.

Errr not sure I understand your question but PoW change code goes back all the way to Bitcoin Classic: 
I don't know if there's a PoW change testnet, but that's a good idea. Especially so the new user-miners can be primed for the real event.

Gold hasn't even launched yet but when it does it will have replay protection. It's creators are calling it a "friendly fork", the purpose of the project to be a testnet for a proof of work change that will be proposed for Bitcoin sometime in the future.
Whilst the SegWit2x guys are indeed incompetent the reason why they are no adding replay protection is to strongarm their changes onto Bitcoiners many of whom run full nodes and can't support any further blockweight. Not adding replay protection also make it more difficult to dump the newly minted shitcoin on exchanges and a lot easier for noobs or careless users to lose their coins.

Well because increasing the blocksize is the absolute worst, most costly and destructive way to "scale" transactions per second (technically it's not really scaling because there's not actual algorithmic optimization, it's just the same algorithm working with a large set of elements) it's all the back at the end of the list of scaling options.
Actual optimizations like Schnorr signatures, MAST, MimbleWimble via extension block and of course the great Satan that can scale Bitcoin x1000 in a completely decentralized security model: Lightning. All of these things can be done via a soft fork (from 2nd hand sources I've read. not lightning obviously smart contracts can be done right now), bypassing miner politics and a hard fork shit storm.

It dosen't take many brain cells to realize that UBI in addition to the current welfare system would be an economic disaster. However if you took all the money we're already spending on welfare (or even a lot less) and just replaced it with UBI it would be far more efficient at helping people and the economy. This was even proposed by Milton Friedman in his "negative income tax" proposal. Same guy who described a Bitcoin like system in the 90s.
Current narrative is to use UBI to save us from robots taking our jobs. But like personal 3d printers decentralizing complex manufacture, why can't we own the robots to transport, farm, labor etc... for ourselves? Why is the only future that big corporations own all the robots and we must be reliant on big government UBI for our survival? Great way to enslave humanity.

Bitcoin is P2P digital cash without trusted 3rd parties. 
In order to make sure the rules of Bitcoin have been followed you must have your own copy of the block chain that you verified is correct using your own full node running on your own hardware.
Increasing the blocksize makes it *exponentially* harder to run a full node using consumer grade hardware and Internet bandwidth. Once normal users are unable to run full nodes they then will have to trust cloud data centers. Once this happens this "centralizes" Bitcoin, suddenly things like censoring transactions becomes possible, even breaking the rule of the 21 million coin cap becomes possible.
Increasing the blocksize has been theorized as a possible attack vector for states or corporations taking over Bitcoin since I've been in Bitcoin (early 2013). I think we're seeing an attempt of this attack play out right now.

Technically speaking it's literally the worst scaling solution on the list of ideas, as it costs full node exponentially in resources for pitiful linear increase in transactions per second (actually it's sub-linear because people will send more transactions more often due to it being cheaper, law of induced demand), it's is a centralization slippery slope that sends the bill to full node operators and on top of this requires a hard fork shit storm

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:18:21
My list didn't include side chains. Side chains aren't intended to be a scaling solution but a way to implement new features whilst isolating any unwanted effects from the main chain. 
Lightning is not a side chain, it happens on the main block chain using smart contracts to "update" a single transaction so it can do the work or say 1000 transactions.

Actually now that we have SegWit it's possible to do Schnorr as a soft fork!
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:28:08
Actually I think Bitcoin's software development cycle is more conservative than "agile". Because we're dealing with real people's real money, failures really aren't an option. Security is thoroughly tested and upgrades are backwards compatible (soft forks) to make sure no one is kicked off the network and we can roll back if needed.

Nope, you don't get it. I can easily buy a NAS and jam it full of TB drives, that's not the bottleneck this is a strawman.
Bottleneck is also not your theoretical download limit, this is also a strawman. You node is also verifying transactions and uploading them.
If it's so easy for say 8, 16, 32 MBs blocks to be verified relayed downloaded uploaded etc... then why has not a single big blocker been able to demonstrate a working testnet? Should be fucking easy, just fork the code, increase the blocksize, get some volunteers around the world with "normal" Internet connections to spam transactions to the max block size and mine.
But it hasn't happened, and that's because the Core devs are right in that full nodes can't keep up.

Blockchains technically scale at O(n\^2) or something like that. Which means that everyones' transaction made needs to be transmitted and stored for eternity for every new user that joins the network. This is so ridiculously inefficient that Satoshi was not received well by the computer scientists on the cryptography mailing list. 
The whole point of Bitcoin is to have peer to peer (not data center to data center) electronic cash without trusted third parties. If you're running an SPV wallet you a trusting a third party (someone with a node) that the rules of Bitcoin are being followed (rules like: there are only 21M bitcoin) or that your coin you received actually exist. 
In order to not have to trust anyone you need your own copy of the ledger and be able to read it quickly. For this to scale as well as it can you need smallest transactions sizes  Bitcoin with SegWit does this better than any other. It's almost like we have the best computer scientists working on Bitcoin

Remember Bittorrent? Governments outlawed Bittorrent but were ultimately powerless to stop it.
Businesses had to change their business models and are now switch to subscription streaming services (Netflix, iTunes, Kindle) where you basically are paying for the organization and time saving service rather than the actual content which you could download using Bittorrent.
Bitcoin's going to be the same, taxes will still exist but it will have to take a different form. I see things like land taxes for example becoming bigger over income and sales taxes.

You don't even know what you're talking about. When bitcoiners talk about scaling we're using the actual computer science definition/concept of scaling not the meme shitcoiner big blocker spaghetti code abomination meaning.
Bitcoin has the smallest transaction sizes making it the cheapest for peers to maintain a full node, hence the decentralized P2P network can actual scale up and not become something centralized and bloated like all these other projects, including ethereum. Especially ethereum with it's ridiculous blockchain bloat. For a project that meant to be all devopsy it's anything but lean, agile and immutable.

This is the same reasoning that selected a 95% activation threshold for SegWit. Admirable but mistaken (yes I did just accidentally quote Bane).
The reality is BIP 148 is the safest choice we have available at the moment. There are forces at work that seek to disrupt, disable or destroy Bitcoin; if we could just get SegWit activated it would be like momentarily getting out head above water to task a gasp of air before we are pulled down again. 
IMO it is a bigger risk to wait and allow the enemies time to think, formulate new attacks and regroup, because we will not survive many more attacks.
SegWit activation in of itself warrants a higher risk tolerance because it allows for permission-less solutions like LN and sidechains to roll out and makes any future blocksize increase far less dangerous due to linear sighashing.

add PunkBuster to growing list of SegWit benefits
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:52:26
The way I see it is that SegWit pretty much ends the scaling debate, because it allows the permission-less solutions from the market to be deployed (like LN); it will heavily discredit dumb blocksize increases without optimization and without respect to full node operators.
If SegWit doesn’t get deployed then like a battering ram the side that wants to centralize Bitcoin under the control of miners (emergent consensus and similar ideas) will eventually get through, this kills the Bitcoin. So doing nothing is not "zero risk" that's fallacious. 
If Bitcoin hard forks that's a permanent blemish on it's record, I'd rather store wealth in something that can never hard fork rather than something that has hard forked in the past.

You need SegWit to implement sidechain cleanly lol
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:29:55


Storage space is not the issue, it's never been the issue. Storage space is only a one off cost of maintaining a full node. For now at least, with Ethereum's blockchain even storage is getting to be problematic.


That's like accepting a 51% attack as the truth. If you have your own copy of the ledger though you know for sure and that's the point. In the early days of Bitcoin we expected to eventually be able to use "fraud proofs" with SPV for "normal" users and do away with the absolute necessity of having your own blockchain copy to validate against. Fraud proofs never materialized. Lightning did though.


Yes, but SegWit paves the way for Schnorr and other _actual_ blockchain innovative technologies and optimizations. Not shitcoin marketing gimmicks to pump the heavy bags of B rate devs and early speculators. 
I think lightning is just one tool in the box, there's a long way to go on the devs scaling road map. Schnorr is next, I hope for drivechains one day too. But lightning is really the perfect tool for micro and day to day transactions which takes so much load off the blockchain and saves us from having to off chain with trusted 3rd party databases which would be inevitable in a non-lightning enabled ecosystem.

You do realize the bitcoins aren't physical things you can pick up and steal. You need the wallet file _and_ you need the passphrase at minimum. You will 99% time steal something that is actually completely useless and that the owner has a backup copy of and will just shift the funds as soon as they realize they were broken into.

Actually that's Libertarianism or maybe even more accurately Minarchism. Conservatism's main focus is on conserving (hence the name) certain traditional social and family values of which one of is economic liberty. As such conservatives sometimes are tempted to use statism to enforce conservatism. The other side of the argument I've heard from conservatives is that you need a certain base line of moral fabric and virtue to get a Libertarian society to work.

Bigger blocks via hard fork are the worst available solution on the table for scaling. I can't think of any worse way to do it.

I don't mean this to be rude, but are you new to the space? 
Bitcoin's block time is not an "inherent flaw" but an important security feature that was chosen by Satoshi on purpose. You want the network to not change until the next 10 minute heart beat. Leave short or no block times to the plethora of insecure and centralized shitcoins.
Besides this issue was already resolved last year with the release of the Lightning Network. I recently bought some steam games using from joltfun.com with lightning. It was an instantaneous transaction. Some retailers like Mind Games in Melbourne have been using it also.

I think bitcoin has a lot of people I would classify as left leaning libertarian types. In the early days of bitcoin you have the right leaning libertarian gold bugs and preppers and the left leaning libertarian drug bugs and hacktivists. As long as you think money should be purely peer to peer I think you'll love bitcoin. 
Take Richard Stallman for example he's both left socially and left economically, as such he has a love hate relationship with Bitcoin. He wants a digital currency that can disrupt what he views as capitalism but also that can be easily taxed to be compatible with a democratic socialist state.

With nodes, businesses, exchanges and developers on our side why are we even considering a one-sided "compromise"? 
They are holding SegWit hostage; that's a hostage exchange not a compromise, which would entail them giving us something they don't want. 
We don't want an unnecessary hard fork and they don't want running a full node to be cheaper and easier so let's get that from them, that would be a true compromise.

You probably need channel factories and other upgrades to lightning to get to billions of users.
But Lightning as it is now scales way better than a blockchain. The more users the more efficient it gets per new user, whereas with a blockchain the more users the more inefficient it gets per new user.

Ripple is a massive centralized scamcoin targeting non-technical brainlets started by the same guy who sold an already insolvent Mt Gox to Mark Karpeles. 
Bcash deceived so many people into buying it thinking it was Bitcoin, and this was clearly deliberately setup. On top of this a lot of money has just been plain lost due to people accidentally sending across chain due to the same address format. 
These are definitely scams but it's politically incorrect to call altcoin scams otherwise you're quickly dismissed as a "maximalist". I mean I completely understand, people don't want you degrading the value of their bags.
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:03:37


This is incorrect. The Lightning Network does not use and is not a sidechain. This is a very very common misconception. I'm butchering it but Lightning transactions summarize the back and forth activity a multitude of transactions into a single pair of transactions (channel open and channel close) to the blockchain using smart contracts. Completely un-reliant on a side chain or any form of centralized system. 


I don't know what you're trying to say here. Lightning is only a year old, and already can scale far beyond any altcoin without sacrificing true decentralization, there are other upgrades to lightning itself that give it orders of magnitude more capacity. Channel Factories for example theoretically would give lightning something like two orders magnitude more capacities and I've heard that even that concept has already been succeeded by something else.


Maybe, but you don't get something for nothing; with the exception of optimizations which none of the other coins do, they make everything more bloated with their new marketable features. Instant transactions compromise either security or decentralization or both. Free or virtually free transactions pushes costs onto node operators and thus also compromise decentralization because the users lose physical control of the network. 
Bitcoin is still the best engineered design by the best computer science minds in the space, everything is elegant, lean, agile and transactions are small so that the cost to run a node is minimized. All the optimizations and actual improvements to cryptos the most recent being SegWit have come from Bitcoin. Hell even an optimization to OpenSSL came from Bitcoin devs.
All the other projects market themselves as "next gen" because it the best way to get you to speculate on their token as few people have the comp sci background to verify and evaluate what's actually good engineering and substantive. 
Bitcoin dosen't have any problems being slow and costly. All these other shitcoins that you think are faster and cheaper have all made deals with the centralization devil in order to achieve this making them pointless or even intrinsically worthless.

As an asset class property is heavily overvalued due to unnatural access to mountains of credit that is conjured out of thin air using the fractional reserve banking system. Shelter is an essential human need and as so demand is very inelastic, so people are more willing to enslave themselves and pay stupid amounts.
What make it worse is that people think it always must go up so they go full FOMO. People like to say Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme but the property bubble is much more ponzi-like. At least Bitcoin enforces full reserve and set supply.
Because house prices are so high, rents necessarily must also be high to help service the debt and are the only game in town for most people.
So you are completely correct, you get fucked and become a wage slave if either scenario of renting or getting a mortgage.

Bitcoin is peer to peer digital cash without trusted third parties. Increasing the blocksize is a tax on the ability of users to self verify the blockchain, and thus will have no choice but to trust a third party like a big company to do this for them. 
Also if you can't self verify with a full node you're not a peer either, rather your transactions are submitted to a peer. So bigger blocks lead to Bitcoin: datacenter to datacenter digital payments with trusted parties.

Chris Kleeschulte from BitPay gets a bit too comfortable with the host and spills the actual reason for the SegWit2x hard fork.
**"This whole thing is about the miners wanting to get rid of Blockstream and all their Core devs. That's the only issue that they want..."**
**"He's [Jihan] told me himself that all he wants is to get rid of those people he hates Greg Maxwell and his crew with a passion..."**
**"We don't like these guys..."**
**"It's almost like a childish thing..."**

This is great:
* Gives certainty to investors that developers really will never "just come back" to the S2X chain. They're cashed out and gone.
* Instead of the costs of a hard fork being socialized to all hodlers regardless of our position, S2Xers themselves take on all the risk privately.
* If S2Xers don't trade their original BTC it will show that they don't believe their own bullshit (so why should you?) and/or they are chickenshit.

You can buy off Coinbase (if that is your best option) but don't store your bitcoin there.

It's automatically done by your full node whenever it downloads a new block. It checks it against your own personal copy of the blockchain to prove all the rules of Bitcoin where correctly followed (rules like there are only 21 million coins). 
Technically with a web or mobile wallet they are what are known as SPV wallets where you trust the service that the rules have been followed.
You may have noticed that some mofos don't think you should have the right to have your own copy of the blockchain to check, it reminds me of like medieval priests not wanting you to have your own copy of the bible so you can't check that they're full of shit.


So say you want to stay on the bitcoin core chain, if you download and run a bitcoin core node it will reject blocks that don't follow the consensus rules defined by that repository.


Everytime someone makes a transaction on the Bitcoin network you have to download and store it. The blockchain is like super overkill redundancy, which is why Bitcoin is looking use technologies like the lightning network to turn say 200 transactions and summarize them into just 2 transactions onto the chain.
Just run it and see how it goes, here's some general guidelines:

Not really, Bitcoin developers easily tested SegWit for months and there have been zero problems with it. Why can't you do even the most basic testing and then propose it to the community, using data to backup your claims of decentralization maintenance? That's how you convince us, how you convince developers, with science and numbers.


Won't benefit me, it will make much more expensive to operate my full node. Eventually larger blocks will mean that I will no longer be able to verify transaction myself and will have to rely on a trusted 3rd party. All for a negligible discount in fees due to the law of [induced demand]( At that point it's Pay Pal 2.0 with suits in charge and users like me having to rent instead of own.


Prove it motherfucker. Where's your POC, where's your testnet? The fact that protocol changes are being dictated by a bunch of suits that self appointed themselves leaders of Bitcoin is a centralized as you can get. 


Even if that was true, shipping a hard fork to 2MB requires something like 12 months, vs say a soft fork to Schnorr which could be done quicker and safer.


Exactly, 2MB is chump change. Such a small meaningless reward for such a high cost of a contentious hard fork without replay protection you maniacs. 


No we don't *know* this, stop trying to scare us with a doom's day scenario.

Still very early in the game, this currency has only existed less than a decade. For it to reach mainstream adoption the price of Bitcoin would necessarily need to be in the seven figure range.


It is if you get pretty much free electricity and access to a cheap chip manufacturing and have millions of dollars of capital to get started. 
You could mine an altcoin with a custom multi-GPU rig and then sell for Bitcoin but you're still probably better off just buying it and holding it.

Running a node is not about "showing support" for a particular set of consensus rules. It's about being your own bank by having your own copy of the ledger that you use to verify transactions using your own hardware. 
The entire point of Bitcoin is to eliminate the need for trusted 3rd parties. Trusting a 3rd party to host your node completely defeats the point. The first level of control is physical control, if that is compromised you have nothing.

You can buy from them before the fork, just don't keep Bitcoin there. Move it to your own wallet.


Ok going to try ELI5.
In programming a fork is where you just copy someone's software and make your own changes to it and release under a different name, in bitcoin is means something a bit different.
In bitcoin the reason your wallet software shows you have a certain number of coins is because it looks at the public ledger of transactions going back to 2009 when bitcoin started (this ledger is called the block chain). A fork in bitcoin means that at some point in time new pages to this ledger (blocks) are accepted as valid by some nodes and invalid by others so there's two versions of the time line. As you can imagine this can cause a shit show.


If you just hold your coins in your own wallet and don't make any transactions the risks are pretty much zero. However this fork is high contentious (it's a corporate takeover by a few big businesses) with no replay protection.
Replays are where after the fork you move coins on one chain and it move them on the other, the problem with this is that you can lose funds. That's why after the fork we need to safely split the coins so that they aren't entangled on each chain. We can then dump the losing coin on exchanges.


Only if coinbase gives you only the failed fork coins instead of the sucessful fork coins or both coins. Get your coins off coinbase after you buy and you'll be fine.

The scaling debate actually got me to stage 4. Realizing that Bitcoin gives up fancy features for smallest transaction sizes and efficient client; thereby is the best at keeping it's decentralized properties under the weight of mass users.
Look at Ethereum, centralized as fuck with a rapidly increasing blockchain a lot bigger than a much older bitcoin. Moneros and zcash' privacy features are cool but their transaction sizes are so bulky compared to bitcoin.
At the end of the day if your developers are good then they are working on bitcoin.

Full nodes are supposed to he privately owned by users so that they do not need to trust some big company to verify transactions. For example my full node runs on an old laptop on my bookshelf. I guess you could find a full node operator at a Bitcoin meetup.

In theory it has no hard limit of transaction per second. 
Other developments down the line are Schnorr signatures and MAST which increase the transactions per second without the tax associated with a blocksize increase. Now that we have SegWit we can implement these things.

@_date: 2017-10-17 19:18:36


Looks like the next capacity increases to be shipped are Schnorr signatures then maybe MAST which I believe only require a soft fork to be implemented. More importantly they don't burden full nodes like a blocksize increase would. 
But yeah, once developers are able to exhaust all optimizations that can be done by soft fork you move down the list to creating a hard fork with a blocksize increase AND as many bundled improvements as possible.


Actually the S2X fork is **admitted** (probably accidentally) to be a business-miner cartel takeover, see:

Because a ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading.

Yes it would, tons of motherfuckers like me would not run it. Just like with UASF which was not supported by half of Core. 


If anything it's the opposite, people are uniting against the S2X takeover; look at all the community meet up announcements, look at the full nodes. The infighting is a engineered narrative to cause enough disruption that we will accept the bizcoin solution

Why not just implement BU as a side chain?

Many full node operators will not agree to this. Why would they agree to a change of the rules that makes it more than twice as expensive/hard to be their own bank and actually self-validate.

@_date: 2017-05-26 05:15:30
This was before there were better solutions. 
There are now far better solutions to scaling than simple blocksize increases. E.g. Schnorr, Lightning, SegWit and more.
These actually *optimize* the resource usage of Bitcoin allowing higher transaction capacity without harming the ability of full node operators to self-validate transactions.
Simple blocksize increases are the worst solution and should be reserved only as the very last resort.

The end of all this scaling bullshit is within our grasp. 
Run a full node enforcing BIP148 and in August we can get SegWit doubling transaction capacity and more importantly allowing the free market to implement scaling solutions like lightning without anyone's permission, that's when things really get exciting.

There are apparently ASIC resistanct algorithms such as cuckoo cycle but I don't know much about them.
There's also a coin called myriad that has a compound PoW system of 5 algorithms that are optimized for different types of computing hardware, so in order 51% attack it you have to beat all 5 algos which is hard when your strength is from specialization like it is with SHA256 ASICs.
I actually think the solution for Bitcoin is going to be a gradual phasing out of SHA256 via softfork PoWA, I would think an ASIC resistant, memory bound PoW compound system of algorithms would just thinking out loud be best.

Because SegWit is tested and ready to go (it's in the code) **right now**. You're looking at 12-18 months for a safe hard fork assuming we would all run the new software which we won't.
Also SegWit itself is 2MB, he's an example of a big [block]( 8,885 transactions! This kicks the shit out of simple blocksize increases they weigh everyone down exponentially.


SegWit was also deliberately engineered to avoid a contentious hard fork which would cause financial chaos and result in [two coins]( SegWit's is a platform for other scaling technologies that actually optimize the performance of Bitcoin e.g. Schnorr.

What's an User Activated Soft Fork Hard Fork?
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:36:56
Once we get SegWit we be able to propose two types of divorces:
1. Merge mined parallel block chains (42 million coins). Coins can be traded before the fork to prevent financial war.
2. Secure decentralized main chain, with much bigger blocks (requiring data center connections) side chain (21 million coins).
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:18:39
Soft forks have resulted in chain splits in the past and not been contentious.

Yes, value Bitcoin represents doesn’t just double out of thin air.
The sum of the buying power of each coin would be less than the original coin. It's similar to inflation yes.
In a contentious hard fork where the miner try to kill the original chain, but the users change the PoW I even see a likely scenario where three coins are born.

Normally a non-contentious hard fork like a security upgrade would be a piece of piss, because it's overwhelming consensus 95%+. But this involves a contentious hard fork, *many* full node operators will not go along with this which means there will be two chains like in ETC/ETH. 
2MB simple blocksize increase is nothing in the grand scheme of things, in fact we won't even get a halving in fees because people will be less conservative with their choices to transact. We need much more capacity in the form of actual optimizations that lessen the burden on the network like Schnorr and Lightning. The number of nodes that will drop off at 4-8MB blocks is unacceptable.
There other block propagation issues and other problems that we really need to observe how SegWit plays out and what else we can do before a simple blocksize increase which is a shitty counter productive solution for P2P digital cash without trusted 3rd parties.

No one is against hard forks in principle. They are sometimes unavoidable, like for example an emergency security upgrade.
But when you have a contentious hard fork, as we saw in Ethereum (lol) both the chains are going to survive. Then Bitcoin is now in a world of shit. Suddenly that immutable blockchain is two chains of 42 million coins of less value then the sum of their parents.
So we're going to risk doing a contentious hard fork... for a measly 2MB? It's a joke. 
Also to expand, we'd need a contentious fork for each future blocksize increase which is going to multiply the chains, then when miners try to kill an original chain it will PoW change and then we get another chain
What it's really for is to set a precedent for increasing the blocksize when fees get high compared to 2013 Bitcoin. Instead of trying to optimize the technology so it can actually scale in the computer science sense of the word, Bitcoin becomes a set of shitcoins
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:51:43

would be great if we could at least get SegWit off the ground so we could get a clean implementation of sidechains.
Then we could have both teams play by their own rules but using the same 21 million coins. This is the dream scenario IMO where everyone truly gets what they want without any compromises (unless what they were really after was political control)

@_date: 2017-05-20 23:01:25
A major problem with simple approaches to increasing the Bitcoin blocksize is that for certain transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly.
In essence, doubling the size of a transaction increases can double both the number of signature operations, and the amount of data that has to be hashed for each of those signatures to be verified. This has been seen in the wild, where an individual block required 25 seconds to validate, and maliciously designed transactions could take over 3 minutes.
Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported.

The scaling debate is so polarizing imagine channeling all that negative energy into the mechanism of a hard fork, you will get two chains and all the shitcoiners and normies will be eating popcorn. 


Jesus Christ man get your testosterone levels checked!
Perhaps if we beg our suit wearing betters the will give us a few crumbs of SegWit. Shit man, UASF is the final solution we will turn their battering ram tactics against them. If it's not BIP148 it will be BIP149, but we need to work hard to get BIP148 else we are going to have this constant scaling debate nagging for another year and a half.

So a hard fork is like terminal open heart surgery.
If it's an emergency, then we need to get the surgery down on the patient immediately and we don't have time to prepare.
However if it's not an emergency we need to schedule regular appointments with the patient, do blood tests, compare their case with other patients etc... then plan the operation and set a date.
We also try other modalities before resorting to life threatening surgery.

Developers did a terrific job, they even flew in to meet each other in person and make sure the coding of SegWit was top notch.

@_date: 2017-05-21 23:16:31
A compromise is a two way street where both parties have to sacrifice something that they want to get a mutually beneficial agreement. Both parties want SegWit, but only one wants a hard fork. It's not mutually beneficial.
I have yet to hear any offering for the the lowering of or at least maintenance of CONOP or otherwise protection of the decentralization of the network in exchange for blocksize.

You need to do SegWit first to fix the quadratic sighash problem, this makes subsequent blocksize increases much safer.
Also to coordinate a hard fork we will need something like 1-2 years preparation and coordination, if you want a fast solution right now you'd activate SegWit which is already laying dormant in Bitcoin and working in Litecoin.

First, don't use their term.
It's deceptive (and confusing) in of itself. SegWit *is* 2MB blocks. To say SegWit+2MB implies that SegWit has no scaling benefits when it actually has more than any blocksize increase by itself ever could.


There's no reason to believe this. You need more than a super majority for a hard fork like this to go forward, otherwise we will be in a world of shit. Suddenly that flagship cryptocurrency that was meant to be so pure and immutable has two chains with different rules. If I put my money in their how do I know it won't hard fork again?


We need your support for there to be support. The power is *yours*.

SegWit is playing inside the existing rules of Bitcoin, this is why it can be a backwards compatible soft fork.
If you think SegWit is bad or lacks moral character then don't make a transaction with segregated witness; why should you be able to stop others from making Bitcoin transactions that are valid within the rules of Bitcoin?

I'm not, without decentralization Bitcoin is completely pointless, if it can be politically controlled it's completely pointless, if I can't verify the consensus rules myself without trusting anyone else by hosting a full node it's completely pointless.

A unnecessary hard fork is not fair or a slight compromise. It's what we are trying very very hard to avoid. Why do you think SegWit was designed to be a soft fork.
Where's the other side's compromise? They want a hard fork, they get a hard fork. Do you even know what *we* want?

I think it's more dangerous to let the consensus rules of Bitcoin be decided and changed by miners and ASIC manufacturers than a grass roots user activated soft fork which is backwards compatible with 1MB blocks. 
I'm not willing to risk Bitcoin becoming PayPal 2.0 as it defeats the entire point of the project. UASF is a walk in the park compared to a 51% attack hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:06:58
on average bitcoin goes up 80% per 12 months
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:32:26
first of all, really both sides are pro big block. I don't give a shit how big blocks are as long as I can still verify the rules of Bitcoin personally with my full node.
I even support a bigger block solution (SegWit), would be happy to see further blocksize increases down the road once we've exhausted other optimizations like schnorr and given a guarantee I'll still be able to run a full node.
But the hard fork fetishes are anti-bitcoin for the current rules of the system, they literally are tipping each other in ether and pumping shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:47:09
Good morning. In less than 3 months, full nodes from here will join others from around the world. 
And you will be launching the largest transaction verification battle in the history o Mankind. "Mankind." That word should have new meaning for all of us today. 
We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interest for higher transaction capacity.
Perhaps it's fate that you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from miner centralization. 
We are fighting for SegWit's right to live. To exist. And should we win the day, the First of August will be known as the day Bitcoin declared in one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night!"

Let's use precise language and not confuse people further in the debate.
SegWit is a 2MB blocksize increase. Period.
Saying SegWit + 2MB implies that SegWit is not a blocksize increase at all, this was deliberately chosen to socially engineer.
What you're asking for is a 4MB total blocksize increase. I say, sure. Let's just make sure full node operators don't get fucked first, let's get SegWit out first see how nodes do, maybe implement Schnorr then we can look at further blocksize increase without optimzations.

Dynamic capacity is not scaling mate, scaling means that the system is able to take on new load without spending additional resources or at least diminishing requirements with new load. 
Furthermore dynamic blocks you give you O(n^2) at best, it makes the problem worse exponentially the larger transactions and blocks are. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:48:19
The problem is the energy/work/value that the current supply of Bitcoin represents cannot be duplicated out of thin air. 
Therefore the sum of the value of the two coins must be less than or equal to the value of just the original coin before the fork.
Therefore the best case scenario for the original coin is that the forked coin's value approaches zero.

Honestly, how else are we going to get SegWit adopted in a timely manner (so that it still even matters) other than BIP148?
All these deals and charters are going to end up as a drawn out shit show we can already see it happening.
All that we need to do is give BIP148 a chance and we can end all this madness.
We'll get 2MB blocks and then companies will be free to implement other scaling solutions such as lightning implementations (like [BitFury]( with permission from the rest of the ecosystem.

SegWit2x. The 8x stands for the 8 times blocksize (8MB) maximum blocksize is allowed. Something that would pretty much bring the system to it's knees, bye bye store of value.
2x is deceptive because it gives the impression of a conservative (a doubling is not even conservative by any definition really) increase which plain old SegWit does by itself and much much safer as a soft fork rather than a hard fork as you can see from this shit show.

Bitcoin's not a centralized tech company. You can't start thinking from that space and then move out. This is a category mistake.
When you engineer Bitcoin you first must think about how to maintain the properties that make Bitcoin Bitcoin. 
i.e. P2P, non-trust, equity, fungibility, non-reversible etc... 
Otherwise it's not Bitcoin, it's something else. (If that's the case there are plenty of promising and very valid and exciting altcoin projects.)
Then you think about what technology *might* be available in the future.

disk space is the least of a full node operator's problems
you can easily get your hands on a 1TB HD, hell there are even 10TB hard drive now, and you can prune no (thanks core)
bandwidth is the biggest problem for me personally, I have to turn my node off to do other things with my shitty connection, if you don't solve the quadratic sighash problem (among others) you eventually get to the point where CPU/RAM become ridiculous and you need on of those 10k computers Jihad Wu thinks you should have since we're all millionaires like him.

I'm more upset about the reason why he wants UBI rather than the actual execution of what he's proposing, which is actually not that bad from a libertarian point of view where other welfare programs will be disbanded in order to pay for the UBI. Of course it would be so much better if you just scrapped the UBI and lowered the taxes by the same amount.
He believes that the deployment of advanced automation, AI and robotics by large corporations will cause mass unemployment so we need UBI to close that gap. Instead of asking the obvious question of why would automation and robotics technology centralized into the hands of large corporations in the first place? Why can't everyone have their own robots working and producing things for them? We already kind of are seeing personal robotics and automation with 3D printers. Why is the model all our jobs being taken by robots rather than having our own robots farming our own food, transporting our shit etc...
UBI in the environment where these massive corporations are hoarding all the tech leads to mass slavery, dependence on big government and probably eventually mass genocide as we humans aren't producing anything and are just polluting the environment and changing the weather.

Bitcoin is a flood network, which scales terribly. We're trying to upgrade it to be able to operate as both as a more efficient flood network as well as a switching network but we need consensus.

Yeah, sure let's see what happens with SegWit first. It may be that 4MB would be fine and people can still run their nodes, or it may be that we don't need to any blocksize increase at all yet because lightning and schnorr work really well.
Or maybe someone comes up with a good dynamic plan that respect CONOP and is deterministic so all node operators get on board.
However it's not a proper information gathering process, it's just a ransom of SegWit unless you fucking fork to 2MB!

lol nothing you wrote even comes close to being a valid point


The goddamn co-author of BIP9 has recently come out to say that [BIP8 is far superior]( in deploying upgrades. You're just making shit up, you don't even know what you're talking about. 


BIP148 completely avoids all scaling politics, by bypassing it all by just getting people to shut up, stop talking and start enforcing the upgrade on their full nodes.
FrakenSegWit/SegWait and the New York agreement are the purely political moves involving backroom deals of self appointed "leaders".

@_date: 2017-07-23 12:04:43
Bitcoin is peer-to-peer digital cash without trusted 3rd parties.
It works because everyone who uses Bitcoin has a copy of the entire ledger of transactions that they have checked using their own computer not someone else's. 
If blocks are too large eventually users will be priced out of being able to have their own copy of the ledger verified with their own hardware. They will need to trust a 3rd party to do this.
Once all nodes are run by elites and miners in data centers it will be very easy for tranactions to be censored or reversed, even the inflation schedule (the 21 million maxmium number of Bitcoins) can be violated.
This means that Bitcoin is pretty much useless and pretty much now the same as PayPal but far less efficient. 
On top of all of this the cost to run a node does not increase linearly with block size, it increases exponentially. Increasing the blocksize makes the scaling problem worse not better. The Bitcoin developers know this and this is why they are so resistant to blocksize increases, it is literally the worst conceivable way to address the problem.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:26:15
Yep, Bitcoin still scales the best. If Monero scaled as well as Bitcoin I would hodl quite a bit of it.

Why would you want to run a full node in the cloud? At that point it's essentially the same security model as using an SPV wallet as you have surrendered physical control of your node to a cloud service provider not to mention contribute to network centralization.
I remember during when they tried to ram through S2X all the nodes were running on AWS. One company could of crippled the network with a single phone call. 
Cloud nodes contribute to boot strapping other nodes so I guess they're useful in that sense, but they don't really add anything for actual security, privacy and self-verification or network decentralization.

Yes, technically you can just spin up an EC2 instance of ubuntu, add luke-jr's ppa, open up port 8333 and there's a new UASF node.

I'm always taking very small profits to buy back in lower when it dips, or if it never does that I've de-risked a bit from Bitcoin and invest it in other things. This bear market allowed me to buy everything back and more.

My worry is that governments can easily enforce space monopolies since the barrier for entry to space is so high, not to mention regulated by air forces.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to be able to transact cash directly with peers with no middle man and no trusted third parties. If you aren't running a full node then you don't have your own copy of the ledger to check the actual truth and must trust a third party (some bitcoin or wallet company for SPV) that the rules of Bitcoin are being followed, rules like there are only 21M bitcoins and the bitcoin you just received actually exists etc...

One of the reasons people fear monarchies it because the monarch is seen to have absolute power with no checks to limit that power, when historically monarchs would often been removed in a coup if they became corrupt often costing them and their childrens' lives. Much more of a deterrent than being voted out of office with a full pension.
Also the election process like we have in democratic systems is basically a magnet for sociopaths wanting to gain power. Hereditary lines of succession don't necessarily have this problem. 
There's a book explains all the statistics of monarchies vs democracies and the monarchies actually come out on top overall I can't remember the title.
I still think constitutional republics with separated branches of power is the best system yet created. But it's not so black and white, monarchy bad, democracy perfect. There's a discussion to be had.

If you're not running a full node. You're not really a Bitcoin user or peer, you're more of a Bitcoin truster for the points laid out in the video.
As a Bitcoin user, bigger blocks would lower TX fees somewhat (although not proportionally to the increase in blocksize due to induced demand) but you'd pay much more maintenance costs for running your node. Electricity, bandwidth usage, if you want to use 100% of your bandwidth for streaming or gaming you may need to buy another line, better hardware than a single board computer, heat generation for warm climates etc... Even if it's possible, most people don't do it because it's just fucking annoying like a high maintenance woman.

ETH did a hard fork that was somewhat contentious because they changed the history of the ledger to reverse a hack.
Therefore when the hard fork happened people that were unhappy with the developers and miners breaking the immutability of ETH continued the original chain as ETC (ethereum classic), many lulz were had that day, especially because so many arrogant fuckers said it couldn't happen
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:40:41
I do truly care about adoption, just not above what makes Bitcoin special which is it's trustless and immutable cash-like, gold-like nature.
In fact I think if we make Bitcoin strong and secure now it will increase it's core value proposition to the point where much more long term adoption will happen. We will get more adoption the more valueable we make Bitcoin.
Old versions of lightning were hub and spokeish, but the current version with SegWit is completely trustless and P2P.

Raspberry Pi are definitely ideal, but I've found a lot of people just have old laptops lying around for some reason. I use an old laptop because first of all it's free hardware I had already bought.

Great article. I concur that your private keys are literally at the mercy of Microsoft (maybe even low tier sysadmins like in the NSA) if you're running your wallet software on Windows. In fact I'd be surprised if your passphrase wasn't already key logged as part of mass analytics which you agreed to the in the terms and conditions ;-)
Another concern are full nodes being run on Windows. As we saw with the forced upgrades to Windows 10 Microsoft is in complete control of the systems via Windows update AT MINIMUM and could easily shut down the Bitcoin network with a single phone call if the super majority of nodes were run on Windows. 
This is why I face palm when people ask me how to install a full node on Windows 10 to keep the network "decentralized."

Bitcoin is the top performing asset most years.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:49:39
All the traditional asset classes are in decades long bubbles due to central banks manipulating interest rates super low and printing money like crazy.
Because of this if you're buying real estate, stocks and now even maybe bonds you're buying at the top and picking up some boomer's bags. Even with gold if you think about it, most of it's market value is it's speculative value not it's intrinsic value, it's way higher in ratio to silver than it should be since central banks got involved with it.
Then in order to get a high paying job that is semi-enjoyable you need to take on tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to be brainwashed by universities. You then get pushed into a higher tax bracket anyway and your life style isn't that much better and you're subsidizing all sorts of evil.
You can start a business, but statistically 90% of the time you'll get rekt and lose all your capital. 
lol, it's all a big joke. It's scary to think but Bitcoin really is the only thing that can get you out of the modern slavery system with ironically low risk if you are investing at least medium term. Bitcoin has been the top performing assets almost every year it's been available.

I'm more upset about the reason why he wants UBI rather than the actual execution of what he's proposing, which is actually not that bad from a libertarian point of view where other welfare programs will be disbanded in order to pay for the UBI. Of course it would be so much better if you just scrapped the UBI and lowered the taxes by the same amount.
He believes that the deployment of advanced automation, AI and robotics by large corporations will cause mass unemployment so we need UBI to close that gap. Instead of asking the obvious question of why would automation and robotics technology centralized into the hands of large corporations in the first place? Why can't everyone have their own robots working and producing things for them? We already kind of are seeing personal robotics and automation with 3D printers. Why is the model all our jobs being taken by robots rather than having our own robots farming our own food, transporting our shit etc...
UBI in the environment where these massive corporations are hoarding all the tech leads to mass slavery, dependence on big government and probably eventually mass genocide as we humans aren't producing anything and are just polluting the environment and changing the weather.

You get a chain split and then it would merge back up when the networks connected again following the most valid PoW chain.
I don't think this scenario could even happen now because of the blockstream satellites relaying newly mined blocks and the solar powered nodes all around the world speaking to them also connected to the internet.
On top of this Bitcoin can easily be it's own network independent of the internet and even the power grid. This only can work if you keep the cost of node ownership and maintenance low. Hence no gigameg (whatever that is) blocks on $20k nodes.

Indeed, so let's just see what happens first with SegWit's 2.1MB and then we can analyse if going to 2MB was a mistake or if we should just stay at 2MB or increase further.
The other option is what I call the "Leroy Jenkins Derpgreement", which calls for a hardfork deployment of 4-8MB blocks in 2 months.

Actually my current internet connection is 0.4 Mbps up, so 2MB would he very taxing if not impossible for me. I kind of want to do other things with my internet connection. Bitcoin shouldn't tax more than 10% of someone's internet connection.
I will however c-c-commppprriiiiiiiimisssseee ding ding ding with SegWit which is 2MB. It's fucking 2MB, say it with me: *SegWit is fucking 2MB*. 
Sure SegWit is a pain in the ass for me to try and find a way to run (will probably see if I can get cable or even move)
What you're as to to C-O-M-P-R-O-M-I-S-E with is a quite dangerous centrally planned with mining cartels and self appointed oligarchs in suits, we need to see how the network deals with 2MB before trying 4MB, anything else is complete madness and a version of the software which most full node operators will not run causing a split in so called immutable bitcoin

How are you doing job wise? Do you have a good paying job that is not horrible to work every weekday? Also your finances, do you spend pretty much your entire paycheck or are you always have something left over?
I would assume from the credit card limit you have that you've got a pretty decent paying job and from the savings, lack of debt and modest car choice that you are also quite good at managing your finances.
If you want to play things really low risk, ask yourself the question what would hurt least if the market completely tanked tomorrow? I'd say exchanging your shitcoins for bitcoin, because if bitcoin tanks it usually takes everything else with it.
Of course there's also the highly likely risk that the bottom is already in and like the last 10 years we're going on another bullrun which will take us to unexpected new highs. In that scenario it would be optimal would be to move as much as you can reasonable tolerate into Bitcoin.

Your 12 word seed is used by your wallet software to generate new private keys. You could keep records of these but there's really no point if you have your 12 word seed which will recreate them all and generate future ones for you.

@_date: 2017-06-14 08:24:52
You do realise the scaling debate is highly contentious? Far more so than ETH/ETC immutability debate. A hard fork fueled by a split in the community must logically result in a split of the coin.

Let me guess, bundled in hard fork for no reason and back room deal?
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:41:28


**SegWit2x is a 4-8x increase.** 
Where's the proof of concept evidence for 8x? Oh that's right there isn't any; we're just going to push that change on the network via contentious hard fork in a couple of months and will see what happens with $40B of other people's money.
Bitcoin doesn’t scale linearly, CONOP for 8x is not just 8x as expensive it's much more than that. The rational thing to do would be to observe the effects of SegWit (2-4x) and then reassess what has happened to the CONOP, number or full nodes, if you personally can still run a node etc... 
This is why developers reply with "LOL" when asked if they endorse SegWit2x. It's complete madness, but after gnawing away at the community over and over again with the suggestion it appears the strategy is exhaustion to lead to capitulation. 
In reality a measly blocksize increase will do fuck all in terms of transactions per second and fees, a doubling in blocksize will _not_ result in halving of fees due to law of induced demand (people will choose to make more transactions because they're cheaper), the purpose is to set a blocksize inflation precedent so that only business elites and miners have copies of the ledger so you will have to trust them and they will rent out the privilege to you like in traditional banking.

Because Bitcoin is so volatile but on average increases 80% a year, the best investment strategy has always been *dollar cost averaging*.

Peoples' egos. 
Most people naturally think of themselves as being of higher than average wisdom/intelligence and that they are informed. Even though they just outsource any hard thinking to the establishment. 
These are the same people that have for the last decade been saying Bitcoin is a tulip bubble ultimately going to crash to zero and ridiculing their friends for positively talking about Bitcoin, all while the price has been continually multiplying higher and higher. 
These people are now inoculated from ever adopting Bitcoin, because if they do they'll be admitting to themselves that they've had it wrong for the last decade and have to confront the question: "What else have I been wrong about?".  Such a process is so uncomfortable to their ego that they'll literally accept any other answer than Bitcoin. 
That's why I think the next step in mass adoption is going to be getting people to adopt Bitcoin without realizing they've adopted it. Like with apps that use Bitcoin under the hood but don't name drop it.

One of the root problems IMO is demographics change a.k.a. "attack of the normies", as more people flood into Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme it dilutes the bravery, conviction and technical aptitude of the original cypher punk / techno libertarian base.
These people just want to make their lives more comfortable in the existing system and are more than happy to be ruled over by authoritarians rather than creating a new system when authority is replaced with cryptography and mathematical certainties.
My hope is that there are enough of us still left that aren't stupid. 2MB blocks are a measly prize for a hard fork; the purpose of a 2MB hard fork is to set a precedent for blocksize inflation to push self verification out of the hands of users and into business elite who will be the only ones with copies of the ledger. It's like the inverse Gutenberg press.
When the hard fork is shoved down our throats by men in suits sucking the cocks of miners, we won't run their software. It's going to be a shit storm at least ten times that of ETH/ETC and at least twenty times that of BIP148.

It's not a compromise, it's an actual solution.
With this both sides get fully satisfied without having to sacrifice anything (unless the goal of the hard fork is to control/centralize Bitcoin).

It's going to be a shit show and we will be in a new debate which will be Schnorr soft fork vs blocksize hard fork. With that option on the table and the free market building on SegWit with lightning I don't think developer friendly Bitcoiners are going to budge.

What Core actually wants is half the block weight i.e. a 1MB SegWit. SegWit as it stands in BIP 141 is 2MB, 100% more! that is the compromise.
Hard fork to 4MB (actually at burst 8MB) are two deal breakers in one raising the stakes, we'll fight it much harder than for BIP148 because of this.

No, what we need is P2P digital cash without trusted 3rd parties, if you increase the blocksize too much then users no longer are able to host their own copies of the blockchain and will need to trust 3rd parties to tell them what the ledger says, bye bye Bitcoin hello PayPal 2.0.
What we *want* is lower fees and faster transactions, we can get this without increasing the blocksize and still be able to keep full node in the hands of users.


Hard forks that are contentious are extremely messy and anything but easy, why not just activate SegWit now which gives up 2MB blocks anyway and see how it goes? It's already dormant in the code and had been tested for months. There are some that want to hard fork two months from now! That's extremely reckless.

With the amount of contention and tribalism happening now it is impossible to safely deploy a hard fork, we'd definitely get two coins.
SegWit was designed to be a soft fork to please all sides but it's just being ransomed so that consensus for something that can't get consensus can be forced. 
Can't get consensus, use coercion. Bitcoin was meant to be immune to this bullshit but when you have centralized mining to bring back in all the shit of the legacy banking system into Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-15 10:27:06
Ton of strawmen and alternative history, but I'll bite.


Top kek, that would have resulted in complete system failure back then. Why was there no proof of concept testnet for 20MB blocks? If big blocks are so safe and great why can't it just be proven? Let's see it running on consumer hardware and internet so we could gather some data about it.


That was Adam's idea before SegWit as a soft fork. Not really much has changed, SegWit would be the 2MB then 4 and 8 are down the line in the future after other optimizations and force multipliers like schnorr and lightning have been exhausted. So to me 2-4-8 is still on the drawing board.


Increasing the block size exponentially is not scaling exponentially, unless you mean O(n^2) which is the entire point of avoiding a blocksize increases as it's a fantastic waste of linear resources thrown at an exponential problem.

I'm more upset about the reason why he wants UBI rather than the actual execution of what he's proposing, which is actually not that bad from a libertarian point of view where other welfare programs will be disbanded in order to pay for the UBI. Of course it would be so much better if you just scrapped the UBI and lowered the taxes by the same amount.
He believes that the deployment of advanced automation, AI and robotics by large corporations will cause mass unemployment so we need UBI to close that gap. Instead of asking the obvious question of why would automation and robotics technology centralized into the hands of large corporations in the first place? Why can't everyone have their own robots working and producing things for them? We already kind of are seeing personal robotics and automation with 3D printers. Why is the model all our jobs being taken by robots rather than having our own robots farming our own food, transporting our shit etc...
UBI in the environment where these massive corporations are hoarding all the tech leads to mass slavery, dependence on big government and probably eventually mass genocide as we humans aren't producing anything and are just polluting the environment and changing the weather.

For a hard fork not to be a "problem" you need an overwhelming super majority (&gt;95%), a trivial hard fork would be something like a security patch that everyone paying attention quickly adopts.
80% miners and suits on one side and 80% users and devs on one side will definitely be messy. And before you ask me how I know that and am just pulling it out my ass that's what you're doing.

Compromise is a two way street where both parties sacrifice something. One side wants a 2MB hard fork and the other wants to avoid a hard fork by increasing the transactions per second with a soft fork upgrade (SegWit) but only to 2MB for now so it's effects can be analysed.
How is a 4-8MB hard fork offer *anything* to the SegWit side? It's an insult and it goes to should the level of empathy and technical understanding that goes into these centralized backroom agreements.

Scaling does **not** mean higher or dynamic capacity/tps.
In comp sci scaling refers to how a system or algorithm is able to use resources with each new element in an array.
Bitcoin uses less resources to achieve the same capacity/tps so it scales better. 
This common misunderstanding is at the heart of the scaling debate.
Don't get me wrong, Monero is a cool altcoin and I'm grateful it exists, but it will be forced to become centralized under a moderate load (compared to Bitcoin), the users making the transactions aren't going to be able to verify those transaction against their own trusted copy of the ledger.

Oh they'll pay the price. Just not in transactions fees.

Honest answer - extemely low liquidity when compared to other forms of money and investment. 
Bitcoin is a tiny niche market of a hundred billion or so. There are individual people that have more wealth than that. We need to get to at least a trillion in market cap to even expect a super stable market; and then once things are primarily priced in Bitcoin there will be zero volatility.

What about a testnet first? We had one for SegWit for months, why not gather data on 4-8MB first before deploying in a 3 month contentious hard fork?

I imagine the developers will start Bitcoin 2.0, most stated the would leave Bitcoin if BU succeeded if I recall.

At least with BIP103 it's 4.4% every quarter, this reckless shit is 700% overnight!
