Ohhhh... how can I do this? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:06:08
If you like you can give me the wallet info and I'll check for ya ;)
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:04:56
maybe this should be upvoted to the front page of @_date: 2014-12-20 04:46:14


Thats a straw man, how are they even equivocal. 


No I am saying he is a casualty of the drug war, just like anyone busted for any illegal drug. Just like most dealers, they are aware of what they are doing is illegal and if get caught goto jail,

I still dont get the punch to the face thing. All is I'm saying as a person, he got off easy period.  I mean shit this subreddit is about to nail him to a cross. And he got off easier then most individuals in the system.

Do you say the same about Pablo Escobars accountant? Seriously he knew he was selling to a reseller on Silk Road, the company flagged it and stopped it then he overrode it. 
Personally I think the drug war is immoral, unconstitutional, and wrong.  But He knew what he was doing.  FULLY AWARE of the consequences.  But saying he is different then the new silk road guy who just got busted for no other then running and codinh a bitcoin escrow service.   
He should not be put on a pedestal.  He should be just grouped in with everyone else as a causality of the War on Drugs.

Not smoking anything when I typed that comment.  He supplied a means for users to get thier fix. Where as the the parents that had to fight for their home, thier greatest asset life savings all they did was raise a son who was addicted to heroin.  So yes on the scale of things he was fucked less then a lot of people who did less. Period.

thank you ill check them out.
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:11:11
live support is telling me oh it shows it went through on our end.. and their own system shows 
Error: The transaction was rejected! This might happen if some of the coins in your wallet were already spent, such as if you used a copy of wallet.dat and coins were spent in the copy but not marked as spent here.
Basically they are just ripping me off now
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:50:32
I understand your sentiment, but realistically he got off easy compared to most in his social class.  I know that sounds bad, but people do much more time for much less of a crime, People lose homes for their children getting caught with 40.00 bucks of heroin,  The outrage should be how does that happen to these people, and Charlie breaks the law and affects a lot more people and only that little happens to him.

Dammit I just posted this. I should read old comments.
I'm not as clever as I thought. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:48:48
Its Brent  bentenhal or however you spell the name.. defcon, howd ya get out of jail so fast?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:01:12
I agree. If people have to pay lots of money to transfer a little amount of bitcoin it will make it out of reach for the vast majority of people. This cannot just be for the super wealthy
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:12:07
I just transferred 200 myself out of coinbase and I also was charged 3 fee. Was charged 8.00 fee for transferring 50 a few days before
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:14:48
I do but I bought my portfolio maybe 18 months ago
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:02:24
That would probably be as likely as someone giving me a bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:13:17
People short bitcoin?...
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:48:45
Appreciate it..  i was looking at the email and the email stated they were taking transaction fees.. they just didn't tell me before.. I appreciate your input.
Who knows I might try BTC again in future to buy something I will definitely keep that in mind 
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:12:44
Thank you. . That's answered all my questions about cold storage.  :-)
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:07:31
Sure Is especially when they aren't even replying to support tickets
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:02:06
thank you, is that a high amount of transactions.. its not even showing up on blockchan for me
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:08:45
I saw that right now, still waiting for my ticket on Friday to be answered.  Seems like pulling an exit scam. Get as much poor suckers money before the website shoes a 404 error
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:06:28
Someone should warn USAA about how the company is run then. Their investment is not safe.
And everyone can downvote me as much as they want but the fact is Coinbases actions hurt everyone.
If their are exchanges that act shady like this, or that the community tolerates exchanges like this BTC will never gain full acceptance, or be a mainstream form of payment. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:09:52
Thank you
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:42:42
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:58:49
Are you serious.. man ive never even had a full bitcoin before lol.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:59:30
As long as they comply with minimum wage I would see an issue but it'd be risky for the employee in case of a crash
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:34:01
You know from having the private key? Or you know because you know?
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:56:30
That's why it jumped out at me if this was a true representation of the wallet it would collapse the price of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:39:50
Not my wallet. . Plus the last bitcoins I had were stolen :/
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:51:48
It just jumped out at me
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:44:49
Since the transaction was authorized I have to wait for an investigation and since they are not based in the us I have to wait upto 180 days for my money... beware of them
