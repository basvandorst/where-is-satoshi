You can't really issue your fiat token on Ripple, can you?

at least the major ones.

thank you 
yes, using scala is a challenge in itself. But it does make certain things more efficient.

True. It's NXT on steroids. We come from NXT.

Colored coins won't work on Bitcoin blockchain, due to obvious limitations. Lightning could change that.  But there's a long way to go still, and actually it's not so clear if Colored coins protocol can be realized on Lightning network.

We support the Mycelium vision of creating a full-scale blockchain-agnostic mobile wallet, and would like to help Mycelium team bring it even further - by providing not only cryptocurrency but also fiat transfers within their wallet service. 
We believe in a certain convergence of fiat and crypto in the long run, so this should be one of the first steps in this direction.  We need to provide some kind of an open-blockchain solution that can be used by existing financial services in order to reduce costs and provide a certain level of decentralization for their users. 
Blockchain-powered fiat transfers will be used in variety of applications, including cross-border remittance, traditional online merchant payments, crowdfunding etc. The sky is the limit here.

James is a visionary with many great ideas - MGW (representing external cryptocurrencies through blockchain tokens), working perfectly on NXT chain, lite clients running as browser plugins, the whole supernet idea is a valid addition to sidechains approach.
Also we do not work with James, he runs Supernet project. But I do support his vision.

yes, exactly.  fully and transparently backed by actual cash.

Bitsquare is a great effort, no doubt about that, but I can't see it supporting fiat transfers. There's no other approach to bringing fiat transfers on blockchains but market maker/gateway approach. We do not believe in "pegged" assets either. We will be offering  an open platform with a goal of balancing out current permissioned blockchains efforts. I'm sorry but banks and traditional payment systems won't go away any time soon, so we'd better make them work on open blockchains, rather than allowing them to privatize blockchain technology.

Have you run away also from Ethereum?
