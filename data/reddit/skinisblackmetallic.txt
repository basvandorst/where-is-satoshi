My question is regarding a network fee which is not specific to “company-owned software” therefore the removal is bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:52:34
Is it?  So..  if I have a shitload of bitcoin it's actually somewhat useful?  :/
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:18:41
This is pretty much exactly what is said about bitcoin core by “bch lovers”.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:48
I’m in that movie. 
On another note: network fee to send 10usd of bitcoin is 77usd.

Didn't the price drop after the last halvening?
@_date: 2015-12-01 14:55:22
Is this reddit war going to affect bitcoin price? (:
edit: unforgivable grammar faux pas

I was referring to what is the "real bitcoin" not the hate on one dude, which I do not give a fuck about. So far, the most useful crypto for me has been light coin.
This back &amp; forth between BTC &amp; BCH is ridiculous bullshit. Either it's money you can use or it isn't. The transaction fees on BTC are a legitimate problem.

Does it matter? They are both code. Which code works better?
@_date: 2018-05-06 22:13:24
Paid zero to on my last square transaction.

Then why the battle over scaling. Obviously this quote is meaningless in the present context.

As a person who doesn't know much about and is kind of peeking in, what it all looks like to me is two sides saying "the other side is full of shit".
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:26:04
Why couldn't the seller simply send you the equivalent bitcoin the same way you sent it to them?
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:17:05
How do you get those?
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:22:46
Does coinbase count as a wallet? Sorry.. I'm sure these are noob questions. I've had some coins in coinbase for a while but I just never used them for anything. I got them a while back, just to start trying it out.
@_date: 2015-11-24 15:01:33
I find this spokesperson very entertaining.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:43:54
The idea of holding them myself sounds interesting but a smartphone wallet seems..  well..   stupid, unless there's perhaps some way to back it up.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:50:06
I get the drift. Thanks for that explanation.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:02:01
Assessing the risk factors here is pretty complex and fascinating. I'm sure these issues have been written about and discussed on here quite a bit.
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:54:00
This news didn't happen to come out about a half hour past midnight, did it?
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:03:27
Very interesting.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:45:02
but..  coinbase in not, technically, an exchange, in the context of this thread, correct?
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:47:53
So, backing up your smartphone, in general could cover this?
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:37:09
So then, "holding" would mean that I have the HD key stored somewhere and no one else does?
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:51:22
Thanks for responding to my noob queries. Trying this out!
Here's $1 @_date: 2015-11-04 15:57:05
Isn't Coinbase 2FA by default because of the text authentication?
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:29:29
I guess I don't fully understand the difference between using coinbase and holding. This seems to be an important issue. (:
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:52:16
Cool..  and perhaps I could transfer my coins from coinbase to breadwallet?
