Ok thank you for the advice. I have one more question then I will put more work into researching myself: Isn't bitcoin sort of a pyramid scheme? My friends and their dads are advocating for it on Facebook, but if it's such a great investment then why not keep the secret to themselves?
If more people buy bitcoin, its value increases and earlier buyers profit. I mean no offense I just want to make sure I understand this correctly.

This was really helpful! After some more personal research I decided to buy some. Thanks for helping with my decision.

I really appreciate the response! I made an edit to my comment that explains why I asked that, but I did end up buying some bitcoins (or a piece of one). I did some research and felt it was a good place to put my money and have no plans of selling it back any time soon.

Thanks for the input! I'll probably put a couple hundred in and see what happens.
And let me know what games you end up selling!

I could probably put a couple hundred down. How quickly will I see a return? Am I supposed to watch it grow and pull out at a certain point, or pull it out right away?
Sorry, I'm very early on in my research. Appreciate your response, though!
Edit: I ended up purchasing my first bitcoins!
But I received a bunch of responses to this, particularly to my question "How quickly will I see a return?" Just to clarify, I realized no one here can look into the future and that risk is involved with cryptocurrency. The reason I asked it was because OPs post and the comment I was responding seemed to have that level of confidence.
This was only after lurking for a couple minutes, but I kind of felt that the attitude toward skeptics was unfair considering it is just that: a gamble. But thank you for all the responses, I'm excited to see what happens.

But I don't have $5,000
