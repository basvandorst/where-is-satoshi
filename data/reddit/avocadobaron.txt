Alt traders are selling into eth instead of btc.

This is hilarious. It's time to sell lol. This company has consistently done the opposite of what the market wants since their film business died.

I had to think about this for a bit. Bitcoin is deflationary. But, cryptocurrencies are not. Anyone can create more cryptocurrencies at any time. In fact, that's what's happening. No one wants to denominate debt in bitcoin because it's deflationary. But there's a solution to this, just issue your own coin for your business (ICOs).
I think many won't like this analogy because it has some trigger words in it... but I still think it has some truth. ICOs are bitcoin's answer to fractional lending.

The best they could do is ban exchanges. That hurts it for a while but doesn't stop it. All that does is cause the crypto economy to be isolated from the real world economy. It's big enough now that the crypto economy would continue to grow even if it was decoupled. It reminds me of the humans banishing the machines to 01 in the matrix because they were threatened by them. Eventually 01's economy grew so large that the humans were forced to attack the machines, but they were hopelessly outmatched.

I hadn't considered this. If retirement accounts become threatened by bitcoin something will happen politically. Retireees freak out when you come after their medicare/pensions/retirements. A political divide over young vs. old could develop. If this happens we'll see headlines like "Bitcoin, millenial's revenge?"

I personally don't think paying by the second for a taxi is very useful. But, the internet is a use case for micropayments. The ad industry on the internet basically developed because there was no good way for paying for things on the internet. Microtransactions will allow us to buy back our own attention from the advertisers. We'll be able to pay for reading a single article without having to setup an account with them.

In this particular instance, transparency would have been far more effective than any regulation. Coinbase could have tweeted the decision to implement BCH from the boardroom. They wouldn't even need to set a deadline necessarily, they could just have someone on their team post a weekly dev blog that outlines their progress. Everyone would know it's coming inside and out and insider trading would be minimized.
Regulating this sort of thing is going to be nearly impossible anyways.

Without the network, even if it isn't used as intended, the store of value use case wouldn't be possible.

Deflation works against you if you have debt. Imagine you want to start a business and you need 10 BTC to do it. I give you 10 BTC today to start your business and say you need to pay that 10 BTC back in 3 years. Would you take that deal? There's a real chance that 10 BTC could be a lot harder to get in 3 years time when more people are using them. There's a real chance that the growth in the price of bitcoin could far outstrip the growth of your company's revenue. What that means is there's a high probability that you will have to go bankrupt on that loan. That means most people won't want to borrow money, and most people won't want to lend it either.
This is a problem that BTC is going to have to address someday if it really aims to displace fiat. You can't grow an economy if entrepreneurs and businesses can't borrow money.

Not really, it was wishful thinking to believe that the IRS would allow like-kind exchanges for crypto.

I'm highly skeptical of this kind of growth without some serious changes to the energy consumption. Maybe on the long run. But, it will have to crash first. The miners just won't support any changes that cut into their profits. It has to crash so badly that the miners will bow out or beg for the needed PoW changes that will allow this kind of growth.

This is all attribution. Searching frantically in the dark for an explanation. Most of the new people getting in don't even know who this man is or the difference between BCH and BTC. Also BCH is down even more that BTC.
The price has been due for a correction. It was just waiting for anything to tip the scales and send it downward. If it wasn't this event something else would have done it.
It isn't good for our mental well being to look for scapegoats.
BTC is on sale. Be safe out there.

The red line would be a straight line graph on normal axes. While not technically wrong, it's causing unnecessary confusion to call this a logarithmic regression. It should be called a linear regression plotted on a semilog plot

micro/nano transactions might be the future that lets us actually pay for the web and begin buying our privacy back from the advertisers.

It's a necessary test. Every dip in the price of bitcoin has been associated with a different crisis. Each is a different test. It's a good reality check for everyone. It will make us all wiser and smarter. Cryptocurrencies are definitely here to stay and they are the future. We just have to keep in the back of our mind that we can't be sure which one will be the winner. If that's even a relevant way to think of it. I think we'll have many currencies and each will serve a different purpose in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

We need a smiling skydiving bitcoin for times like this. That captures my cocktail of simultaneous fear and excitement.

Your analysis would have to take into account that the notional value of an asset doesn't represent how much cash is needed to liquidate that asset. In fact, the current notional value of that asset will be far in excess of the value to liquidate that asset. The reason is that each guy who sells has to sell at a lower price than the last if everyone started liquidating.

Can any small business owners explain the 15% discount? I know credit cards can cost 2-5%. Where's the rest of the benefit coming from? Is it a "tax thing"?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:43:17
Yep, good point.

You made the best decision with the information you had at the time. I still remember when it came out I saw it first on the 4chan bitcoin threads. It seemed like a toy back then... a proof of concept. I remember thinking "huh, that's cool, lets see where it is in a few years". I don't kick myself for not buying. I could have just as easily been one of the people that lost all their money in mt. gox even if I did buy in... I could have been hacked because I didn't understand security well enough. There are a lot of what ifs, no point in really thinking about it too much. Just take the lesson and move forward with it.

Bitcoin will be the trunk of several tiers of payment networks. In 10 years the vast majority of transactions will be several layers removed from the blockchain. Most of these transactions will be secured by the threat of using the blockchain to resolve disputes. As a result they will almost never need to touch the bitcoin blockchain directly. Even though people will never use bitcoin directly, all of these payment networks wouldn't be possible without bitcoin at the foundation.
Bitcoin will never scale and it doesn't need to. Think of bitcoin/blockchain as "internet law" it's just a tool to enforce international contracts.

If it gets that high I don't think 'cashing out' is the right way to think about it at that point. For bitcoin to be that valuable it has to be pretty wide spread, the world is a different place. You won't be cashing out, you'll be using them.

Having a historical record is actually quite valuable. We are seeing more institutional money in bitcoin because they have data to fit their valuation models to. New coins wont be able to get that money for many years, no matter how good they are.

If anything economy of scale favors the wealthy. A billionaire will get more hash power per dollar than a millionaire.
PoW is just PoS with extra steps.

This along with increased regulatory burden on banks is the real answer. We are terrible customers for banks because we ruin their margins on personal accounts. We just need to find a better solution for this.

Be careful. I have a schizophrenic family member as well. You have to be very strong mentally or else it can bring you down too. I wasn't strong enough and it wore me down to the point I could no longer take care of myself, much less my family member. It's a slow drain too so you any not notice the slide. Not saying you shouldn't do it, just that you need to be strong yourself.

Yes I would definitely watch this.
