when will they be lost because of change then? They say if you don't backup before 100 transactions they can be lost.

That so ignorant, you can't force people to use bitcoin, i have litecoin, doge and quark and i can by my groceries, fasfood, games, mobile top ups with them already so why would i want to use bitcoin, besides they are much faster. Bitcoiners need to accept this fact that its not the only crypto anymore
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:16:05
I didn't say bit coin goes anywhere, i really hope bitcoin goes through the roof and want to see it happen, i'm just saying it won't be only bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:44:51
It's all about pump and dump even with bitcoin, traders decide Bitcoins price and what matters to traders, moneeeeyyyy

So the exchanges are the problem, ethereum is introducing decentralised exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:08:39
It will start with Bitcoin and other Cryptos will follow, payment systems also goes for other cryptos
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:40:17
I actually bought my first BTC at $90
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:34:30
I know it doesn't pose a problem, but its pretty slow in my eyes if you compare it with some top alts which are much faster. Well it seems that bit coin doesn't really care on improving its speed, i hope it does
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:38:59
Well unfortunately it doesn't work that way, its the same as saying why do we have tons of clothing brands, car brands etc etc. Competing and multiple brands will always exist

So can i go ahead and make a new backup? so after restoring they will be there right? I'm scared to do this lol just want to be sure, because people say you can lose them after more than 100 transactions because of change address or something.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:06:45
I'm not talking about money, it seems you have a stake in bit coin and wouldn't want to see other cryptos gain attention
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:59:58
Bitcoin won't be the only true crypto, i know it's hard to accept, but its the truth
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:27:08
I mean backing up my wallet.dat I haven't made a new backup for 130 transactions already. If i backup now and restore the new wallet.dat will lose my remaining 8 Bitcoins? I'm saying this because the change or something.
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:15:22
Did you went to Red Light District or called an Escort? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:09:53
No need for that, it's already obvious in the Cryptos scene, but you probably only follow Bitcoin so i don't blame you
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:20:19
I only want a couple of alt coins to succeed, i agree that 85% of the alts need to go
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:38:42
Don't take this too serious, it's a fictional vid made by a quark fan, i actually liked it
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:53:54
I restored my previous backed up wallet.dat and luckily they were still there, i just made a new backup of the current wallet.dat and replaced it with the old one. So good :)

Darkcoin is one of the cryptos that won't be adopted in the mainstream, it screams illegal activities
@_date: 2014-06-26 10:11:38
Are there any other Crypto which have been successful in gaming?
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:17:21
Yes it would be nice if it would be like this 
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:57:29
There are Cryptos which are faster than Bitcoin, Bitcoin is slow and it can't it won't be faster. Second Ethereum brings improvement for sure
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:22:36
No it's not, Bitcoin is much more established than before. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:58:35
Thats why i said in the near future. More exchanges offer multiple Cryptos, it won't be a 1 Crypto world anymore in the mainstream, just accept it
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:26:54
I think he means exchanges and Ethereum is the answer
