I was looking for answers in this subreddit. But literally everyone has their own speculation, like wth
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:24:27
Congrats you made something, right again. Does your life made sense again? Don't thank me I'm just a loser here
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:32:00
And 100k is too optimistic in this time. So yeah, thanks for waking me
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:43
Tell me why bitch
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:30:34
"This item isn't available in your country"
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:20:51
I don't get it
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:00:23
I think this is what's pulling the bullish now
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:13:35
You're kinda cool. Do you have skype?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:53:36
Should i just buy this cheap bitcoin right now ?
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:55:11
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:07:33
There's always this type of person here in reddit that fucks the shit on you every god damn time. Ok dude calm down, I'll admit I don't have that kind of net worth you probably think I have. I'm only 17 and I don't even think that I have any "net worth", whatsoever. Now what? You'll tell me to get a job cause I'm about to say that I'm also about to use bitcoin to earn money. Thank you btw, you made me think stupid (about investing in bitcoin) enough to stop with this "nonsense".
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:46:12
����I knew someone's gonna say this, god!
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:14:09
I like how the road back there looks 'declining' downward. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:35:30
Why? You wanna be the Armstrong of the first moon bullish?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:39:12
If the argument is about buying. Then yes I'm definitely buying, I've been waiting for this drop. The last week's dip had the same reason of dropping, but this I think is having its amid drop and this is actually what I was looking forward. Telling one person to buy bitcoin today won't do much even
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:34:24
2am passed
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:34:38

Tryna' say he's asian ?
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:43:44
I know bitcoin can still recover from this, but is the price rise coming anytime in this week or will it stay down there? Wanna know your speculations guys.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:14:13
But most of them does. Dumbass
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:07:02
What's a good amount of bitcoin to start with
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:46:53

@_date: 2018-01-17 06:37:00
Lol good one
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:16:30

@_date: 2018-01-17 06:17:46
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:56:23

@_date: 2018-05-24 10:15:04

@_date: 2018-02-09 15:58:08
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:03:34
God, tell me this dip will touch its actual bottom
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:00:56
And these 'people' who cashed out their money were panicking by this Indian news. So the crash was still about India, not India itself but the local media of the said country.
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:57:39
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:05:39

@_date: 2018-02-06 13:21:26
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:18:13
He will sell at 12k
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:37:08
So much questions but no answers, whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:53:20
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:10:16
You should've atleast research shit about bitcoin first before going in.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:31:19
So you're saying, this dip will drop to 8k then up to 9.5k ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:18:06
Another averaging question :3 what about selling some bitcoin? Does that make changes on my value?
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:45:33
Irrelevant life
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:03:21

@_date: 2018-02-12 10:15:04
It is aloof below 8k. Yeah it will go down but not below that shit
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:41:37
Try IQ Option. That is what I use whenever I'm outside and needs to monitor the price
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:51:47

Yeah it reached 19k at year's end. But if you really read his post, you should be able to know that he didn't mention any month.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:12

Local news.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:51:57
Seeing bitcoin crashing, crashes his mentality. Lashing him out to crashing his own vehicle.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:23:14
