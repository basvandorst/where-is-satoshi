as a community we will solve this or create an ecosystem in which this becomes less of an issue.

In Vertcoins defense their argument is going to be the mining aspect. But all these alts have the problem of "not being bitcoin". The first mover is important.

Yeah, people are underestimating how much this change is really needed. The network is overloaded. It is clear the creator never intended for the currency to get this type of attraction.

The question I have is that by 2040 people will be selling off into what exactly?

We need a decentralized exchange eventually.

I agree it won't play out as I or others have envisioned. But the powers to be didn't intend for the dot.com bubble, the housing bubble, or the Iraq war to be a failure.
We are all individuals who are actors in systems always in conflict. If one could accurately foresee the future he would be God on Earth. 
The greatest illusion in life is that we are in control.

lol yeah. I have made my "speculative bets". 
No one knows who will come out to be king.

What is amazing is that bitcoin is hitting ATH now. I always imagined it would do that when the next big financial crisis hit. 
People really think the government and central banks will be able to save their skin again? They barely did it last time. 
The only people I can respect now in the game are those who vouch for physical gold. But people who think Dollar king next 5-10 years. What a joke.

Not even surprised Feinstein is behind this. She is as corrupt as it comes.

if this is a legit question you can unsubscribe? I forgot if you can hide a sub in your reddit feed but I think it is possible.

and replaced with a state-backed crypto? If you think this fiat game can continue or if you think a new gold standard backed by central banks will be the 'reset' I think you will find that it will be much more complicated than that. 
I wrote that we need a decentralized exchange not for avoiding taxes but because competition is needed to keep up the innovation and avoid monopoly. Let the people choose where and with whom they can trade their money.

We need more merchants to adopt. I think it is a mix of the "technology not being 100% ready" but also like any software, there needs to be a maturing rate with constant feedback.

I understand that people are panicking because of the price drop. But those who are here for the bigger reason understand that the fight against fiat and central banks is a long fight.  
This is a good ego check though. People need to stop thinking that the price == success.

You got some good points there, and I would agree that right now the coin is a speculation. But I was able to buy stuff with the coin with my digital wallet. So your last point is a bit mute.

Congress doesn't know how to handle the tech of the 21st century.
Just shows you how powerless they truly are.
