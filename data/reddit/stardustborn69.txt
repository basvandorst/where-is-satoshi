I know we will go back up, and this is hardly a dip. But it made me think of this song from my childhood. �� 
Not even really a dip, doubt we will see below 7K BTC.

Normally when I see dips I wait an extra day or two for the rest of the market to react. But, put in a couple hundred like earlier at 9,400
Check in around 8 am or when you wake up. If Asia lowers the price more that will be close to the low. If it goes higher atleast you got some now. I'm sure we will see prices around 8K to 12K for a while the total market cap tries to become sustainable 
My bet is it will go lower short term

I would say buy! Smart to invest when your are young, because if it doesn’t work out you have so much more time ahead of you to make it back. right now BTC is the same price just about as when I was buying in October 2016. 
You may end up having to hold 2-5 years to see some results, especially with such a little amount you are investing. Shoot the market could take back off in the next month. It’s still a lot price driven by speculation. I believe it should be because the technology is better than the current system we are using in all sectors. Still not sure if that means blockchain is what will survive and not cryptocurrency. The usage of crypto is still unsure. I like to think that the ecosystem is being built and it’s just a waiting game.
So what you work looking for is yeah you should buy, but prices will probably move not much is what im thinking for a little bit, so invest what is good amount for you and don’t rush. Even though it’s still strongly speculation a lot of ground work has been laid and It just seems weird that so much effort would be made to just kick crypto to the curb.

I didn’t know there was lack of security. Wish I had alot of crypto funds, so that I could worry about such issues hahaha. Which app do you use when keeping your crypto on your phone?

Coinomi is decent for a android you get a 12 or 24 word seed and your own password. Have to agree with everyone else on if you want it secure ledger or trezor
