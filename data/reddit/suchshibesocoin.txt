here's a great example of how lame america's money system is (and not just them, but the parties involved). 
1. I Sell used and new (Older/rare) CD's on Amazon.com.
2. I attach my paypal to my amazon for deposits from sales.
3. I have a bank acct. attached to my paypal to take the $ in.
So - here is how it works - 1. Customer buys a cd online, i ship them, amazon takes their ridiculous cut, and the money goes to my paypal (this takes 3 days).
Then, after that, the $ goes from my paypal to my bank - another 3 days. So, selling on amazon takes a minimum (!!!) of at least 5 days to get my measly $ back after all the banks and paypal and amazon have taken their cut (Yes, perhaps i can attach my bank acct to my amazon instead and skip paypal, but it's easy to use to buy with etc... anyhow, that's my take - also - i have to drive an extra 10 minutes to pull cash from a an "In-network" ATM, else i get charged about 5 USD - 2.50 to the atm owner and 2.50 to MY own bank.. Thieves. no wonder we all love bitcoin. :)
Edit - when i say "Days" in $-terms, i refer only to Monday-Friday, (and then we all know about bank holiday bs). thanks.

Sorry to come off rough, and thanks, as I agree, and concur, yet still, it is frustrating to see it daily, as it's giving btc a bad rap overall and hurts us all... 
I guess we all have our own levels of paranoid. I'm more comfortable having my coins on a mycelium android wallet (my phone is like a few months old) with no root or shit apps, than i am on my 2 year old primary pc, or 4 year old work laptop, so yeah i agree, but it's more about backups to me - back the shit the f up,  yo! - EVERY time you move stuff/change things/add/delete addresses, whatever!!!, and put that backup somewhere safe(!!!), be it paper or a usb or two.... i just get baffled by these posts making it to the front page. hell, if i lost 50 USD in btc, i'd just move on, i certainly wouldn't cry about it on reddit... then again, maybe im' just turning into a grumpy old man (ok not really but sheesh, so frustrating sometimes... security is hard, but it's not impossible by any means). 
**EDIT - I DID lose 50 USD in BTC now that i recall once, because i got drunk one night (~ November/2013 sometime probably?) and moved coins and forgot to save the password on the wallet into the text file (that i was supposed to pgp encrypt after duh), so yeah, i know the feeling - in fact, i purposefully deleted the address so that i wouldn't ever be tempted to see how much $ i fucked myself on "in the end" - and .... ah, nm... here we go -** 
**TL;DR - I lost 50 bucks in btc once too. life goes on. &amp; best of all, i don't even care! :D**

@_date: 2014-07-02 23:35:17
yes i understand that point as well, and IANAL, and have zero faith as well having been caught in legal problems before, the *system" rarely works in anyone's favor... let's be honest... But again, the gov't has not disclosed how they actually obtained the most important evidence - not his laptop, but the server image, and how they actually found him physically. if any of this was done illegally, the case is kaput. jury or not. Plus, if that happens, it would be far before any jury was even drawn. just sayin', i understand your point, but the evidence here is not trusted or proven (yet), so either way, yes, he can walk, but i'm with you, he should do some time. although i do have to commend anyone having balls that large, sorry! :D 
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:10:59
y'all should just stop speculating, and google the PDF for the case. it's pretty clear on the evidence so far, and not so good IMO for Mr. Shrem, but again, IANAL. :\

@_date: 2014-07-14 21:33:02
True, however, i trust Coinbase more than some random person on LB.com to NOT knowingly be taking in/buying btc that was involved in something illegal or not so nice. just my thoughts, as i said, i haven't used lb.com, but still.. it just seems kinda shady, when you can use sites like coinbase or what not... and for cheaper, from what I can tell... (?)

ah, sorry, now i hear ya. i can agree with that, but hey, people have to worry about large dumps a bit - lots is at stake on this (still somewhat shaky?) frontier IMO... good point, thanks again. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 01:21:41
Hi, i love this, as i'd like to give my kids a bitcoin or two for birthdays to be spent once they are 18. can you make a guide for us newbs who do not understand exactly what data you require? Im sorry, i'm not new to btc, but i can't reliably give you info if i'm not sure how to extract it from a wallet address or even how to generate a secure address. thanks, love your concept it should do well! :)
edit - btw- to those who are going to downvote me for being stupid, sorry, but if you want btc to become mainstream, it needs to be easier. thanks again to all! :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:30:19
i agree. I belive that this foundation is nothing but early adopters with tons of coins to burn on their own fucked up, profit-mongering agenda.  i certainly don't see any nascar cars outfitted with BITCOIN all over them LOL... :D

has anyone here actually read the PDF of the charges? it seems he was not quite "three steps removed" in this case at all. in fact, it doesn't look so hot for Mr. Shrem IMO, but then again, IANAL.... (just the son of one lol).
edit - no disrespect at all Mr. Shrem as i know you can read this, but still, just my opinion. i hope you do well, good luck man, i'm glad for all you have done as well, but disappointed it ended like this for you... well, hopefully not, but you know what I mean.. it's hard to clean a reputation, online or off, despite the outcome, as Mr. Pierce is now finding out.... :(   
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:28:17
This - Exactly. You can't have people with any kind of tarnished backgrounds trying to be behind *anything* that is trying even remotely to become "legitimate". life does not work that way mr. pierce - you made very bad mistakes as a youth, that will forever haunt you. please do the btc community the biggest favor ever and move on/step down. you clearly don't get it. and neither do your apparent "apologizers"... jesus. unreal how stupid people are.... :\ 
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:14:36
This is pretty different, and yes, i'm very much old enough to remember that waste of life ordeal. There are many questions unanswered related to the manner in which the gov't obtained the evidence. as one person put it, this a very complex case, involving multiple "chains of custody" - if merely one point in any of the chains have been found unlawful or  compromised in the evidence, all the evidence could in fact be tossed. this is *not* murder, this is more about the gov't seeking to make a very big statement, which is probably why he will in fact be found guilty, as they would certainly look like fools wasting our hard-earned (stolen) tax dollars on such a huge endeavour ... or .. did i miss something in the oj trial that relates to this? :D cheers! :)
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:50:25
Perhaps, but you have no proof. Further, does/will anyone else?  Google "Prosecution Futures" and bitcoin.. that's kinda scary to me, despite the fact that i've never done anything illegal. i'm not buying your bridge, but only cuz i'm broke atm.. :D 
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:00:28
yall miss the whole point - he's a troll. he trolled you all. lol.. :D
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:30:11
i can see why he does this, and admire him of course. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:10:12


and, ironically, he has 3.x btc... smh
@_date: 2014-06-16 02:31:38


Really? since when did ghash give up the ~5x %?  
anyhow, your wrong, the protocol will outlive the currency, imo, but if not, it will certainly break even. :D

well, i guess i'm as jaded as you since i believe that too, but hey, this is a revolutionary case, it's going to set precedent, so yeah, i'm sure it will have a lot of influence from many angles.

lol.. great review here - 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:56:36
yep. sorry. no sympathy. use a reputable site, i mean even the name sounds shady as f***k, right? i guess the tears have already begun and it's not even a  noob! :\
EDIT - Felt bad at first, then I read all the comments , &amp; i changed my mind about how i really felt. .... we are all the community here, but in your case, you can really only blame yourself, sorry man. good luck. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:49:05
apparently it's still having effect (?) 
@_date: 2014-06-20 23:19:39
holy shit. i'm new to this betmoose stuff. is this legit? can i really win a half btc on this like snap? LOL. Thanks! :)  /or am i a moron whos just missing something here? :S
oh wait, i guess this part means im just loaning the site my btc, in this case anyhow, right?  
2. What does “You can’t lose if you win” mean?
If you won your bet, the *minimum* you will get back is your deposit - you will not be charged any fees if your bet payout &lt;= your bet deposit. This will only matter in the case of significantly lopsided bets. Consider a 1 BTC vs 1000 BTC bet where you bet on the second side and win. Even though you won, your fees would technically exceed your payout, but BetMoose will still send you your whole deposit back.
thanks!

@_date: 2014-07-14 18:50:15
Not having used that site at all, but know how it works, here are a few things i would have to wonder/worry about if i were buying - 
1. how would i know the coins were not stolen from someone else first?
2. How would i know the coins were not involved in illicit/illegal (ie darknet) transactions?
3. Where I live, I'd likely want to bring a handgun (There is no law about carry concealed weapons here I should add). I suppose if i were selling, i would feel so as well. (Edit - This is purely for my own self-protection only, i must add). 
So.. Just throwing that out there, but... I'll stick to coinbase, thanks! :)  
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:06:00
when did the market react and go down? seems to doing quite well since friday. (or are you talking like really short-term pricing?) thanks!

@_date: 2014-07-15 02:04:53
totally. maybe i'll do that lol. what infuriates me is that there are several good people do this now, but with BIP38 encoded private keys, so therefore worthless to whoever makes the card. I'm sure as fuck never going to buy some card where the owner knows or knew the priv key, what a fucking joke...  
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:16:11

edit - I apologize for not stating this thread was about DPR SEIZED COINS 2, not the recent auction/users coin .... 
Sorry but I did not state what you claim - indeed, the only coins auctioned were the silk road wallets, being the escrow/user's $, not DPR's. sorry, not being rude, but you obviously did not read what i posted. if you google dpr seized coins 2 you will see his coins, not the ones that were auctioned off. btw, why am i replying to mis-confusion? well, it bugs me. thanks! :)

perhaps to you, but actually not really - i've worked in it my whole life, and been involved in cases ... so... i've seen how the chain of custody *must* work for a legal and clear-cut case to prevail in a court. thanks for the opinion tho! :)

tha'ts the point. i think. i believe btc (as coin) is excellent storage of long term value - as opposed to a currency. (Yes im in the us, so the taxmen have ruineth). .. regardless., the BTC protocol will eventually overtake or be re-written by the real players. (I'm old. i saw the whole dot-com bust coming, the domain squatters, the cypherpunks, you name it. i'm not often wrong, but... we'll see.  as the price plummets. lol.. :D
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:30:13
Heres' 1 way i found, it requires a payeer.com acccount and a btc-e account, which i think are both pretty easy to setup with minimal verification... 1 setup up payeer.com account. add funds using visa/mc, (accept the $10 tranfer fee, this is the bummer). - once you have FIAT funds in payeer, goto btc-e, goto deposit USD, select payeer.com etc, add your funds from payeer to btc-e - then, go to trade the usd for BTC on btc-e, then (quickly) move the btc off to your own wallet... anyhow, sounds painful, but if you want btc from your cc pretty damn fast, this is a good way. 
EDIT - this is a good/easy to buy any crypto currencies, not just btc i should add. edit 2 - not sure if your CC takes it as cash advance or just a charge, so watch your account(s)!

But.. But.. isnt that exchange run out of some strange EU country, and noone even knows who owns it? I can't believe it would be sketchy. /s  (sorry, but seriously, that place is sketchy as hell, i'm still surprised it keeps existing so well (apparently)).   Sorry, and good luck, i avoid any exchanges like that, as i hear they don't even honor any AML or KYC laws, which I suppose is great for criminals, but not a regular law-abiding guy like me who lives in the usa. In any event, i hope they help you out, keep us posted! :(

I'm not demonizing anyone - he did that to himself. google him, and you shall see. I am no btc whale or rich person, just one lame dude who holds 1 btc in reality. SO - that said, i'm not proud of an organization repping my favorite coin who shills for people with SKETCHY as fuck pasts - didn't charlie step down? yeah. Didn't marK? yeah... ok.. maybe you don't get the real point yet - but here it is for you TL;DR style - The overall BTC community hates the BTC Foundation, for many, many reasons, and that's why [Mike Hearn's Lighthouse Project]( recently made a fortune to push them into irrelevance - not to mention, it's quite brilliant... Put that up with Andreas A, who just stepped down due to lack of "transparancy" and yes, it's fair to say their days are seriously numbered. However, that is just my opinion, which is similar to your own asshole.. Hahaha.. cheers! :)
