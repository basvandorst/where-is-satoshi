This is one of the big factor these days, Lightning network is coming soon to solve these problems!

Awesome, hats off to you! Thanks for doing whats right for everyone

Exactly, "All it would mean is that sellers couldn't publicise the fact that they accept bitcoins."
with gold, u don't go to a shop and pay with gold, currency is currency, it should be convenient to pay with like all the mobile apps out there help you to do so
"Even if it was banned in a country, the people in that country can still buy bitcoins online, and spend them with anyone who accepts them"
then it will be way too limited and the price will go crushing down because it won't be global

I'll agree with u on  and  but  if they can't tax something or have control over it, they will definitely try to ban it

They can, no registered vendor then can use bitcoins to sell anything like everyone is dreaming might happen in the near future, bitcoin then would only be left for black markets, i guess

Lets say you live in US, there are many vendors currently accepting bitcoins right now, we hope that it will be widely accepted in the future, like every other vendor will be allowing you to purchase with bitcoins
Suppose US bans it, the registered businesses running in US will have to stop accepting it, thus means, living in US, you can't really use bitcoins now can you? except the websites that operate outside US or black markets where not everybody goes?

Its not for Americans only, I'm just giving an example "what if" a big country is not allowing bitcoins, 
i am not saying bitcoin won't exist anymore, it will but only for black markets then, or some countries and since people won't be able to use it anymore in real life where its not allowed it will become pretty much useless for them

"Since the transaction is valid on both chains, both nodes would accept it"
I don't understand 1 thing,  if btc/btu are working on different networks/blockchains how will another blockchain accept the transaction valid?

Its a big amount, let me see how you can sleep with making a deposit of 100,000 and not getting a reply, 2-3 days is understandable, 10 days? of course if you're giving a poor service people will give you shit  because they do it for money not for free.

Lol @ every kraken guy replying here within a few minutes of this post, when they should have responded in their website and not come up with the reason "big backlog of tickets", shameful

Know your Customer (ID verifications)
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:48:24
I just placed an order, lets see how it goes,
One suggestion: It says waiting for 5 network confirmations, it can take up to an hour waiting for that, i suggest lowering it to 2 confirmations only
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:57:28
Thanks for nothing lol
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:21:44

@_date: 2018-04-05 20:30:29

Thanks ;)

Sell on margin, it will partially sell from the ones you have bought on margin :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:58:46
Weird you should be able to transfer the one u sold but im not 100% about this, maybe it will show up when you close the margin position? doesn't make sense though :)
