Once sounds like a change address. I've never used coincorner though. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:55:04
Hey - do you remember parts of your password? If you really don't remember anything even the best recovery folks won't have a chance. 
There is often a way to only send part of the wallet so it can be decrypted without access to the private wallets. I haven't tried this on electrum. If you know most of the password and need a brute force, I can look into how to do it for you.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:41:18
Posting here so I can reply later. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:09:19
That its. Just hold. Learn about bitcoin here and on other sites. Welcome to the community. Bitcoin is much much more than getting rich.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:17:08
also volume right now is 40 total contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:46:19
Yeah I added to my long position around 18.5k. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:02:36
Genesis block was 2009. GPU mining wasn't developed until 2010. You're dates are off or you weren't mining bitcoin. 
If you were solo mining back in the day it would be just saved in your wallet.dat. A week of mining back in 2009 is probably 20 million usd today. Sucks man. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:55:07
Becareful of structuring. It's where you do a bunch of small transactions (10k or less) to avoid triggering bank rules to report large transactions. It's illegal. If you have 100k get Coinbase to increase your limit. Pay your taxes. Have fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:39
Yes. Can you describe a little more detail about when you created the wallet. Did you use it to send / receive. Also do you have your seed or remember some of the pw? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:25:05
Did you find the wallet.dat file?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:24:36
You have a shot! Take a look at btcrecover. PM me if you need more help. I have a custom version I created to make btcrecover check for more common typos etc. also include btc/Btc in there as well. How many characters do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:45:52
Yup! Use the same seed for electrum and also electrum cash. I honestly haven't claimed by gold yet, so can't advise how to do that!
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:25:07
naw, 300 coins creating a buy wall at 11799.98. Most are buy orders. Probably another 20mins then we break it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:59:09
What year about was this created? 2013 is when BIP39 came out. Are all your words in this list? 
The next most likely is blockchain.info - did you create a wallet back then? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:05:32
I thought it was 2 days before the 3rd Friday of the month which would be 1/17? Source for the 8th? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:33:43
I feel bad for you bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:55:13
Coins are cheap right now. Think how bad you will feel when we hit 25k on Jan 1 and you sold at 13k today! Been through 3 "crashes" and still HODL (actually adding to my position). The signals are strong right now. would pile more cash in if you have it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:42:36
Long shot but does this work for you? 
 
Check the public key on the block chain to see if there is any value. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:57:18
I can try to help you brute force this. Can you post or PM me your best guesses at passwords. Helpful if you know case, if numbers were used, special characters, and length. I'll come up with the search space and see how long it would take. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:39:37
Nope. There are still 1024^12 combinations. I however would transfer to a new wallet in the off chance he sees the 2nd half. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:36:41
Thank you for doing this. Much needed today. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:54:12
Honestly, your best bet if you didn't back anything up is to try and fix your phone.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:30:12
People don't always make decisions based on the best financial outcome. There is definitely a sense of freedom once you are debt free. There is also risk even in broad based index funds.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:19:20
Thanks. I found version 2 of their algo. No graf on the wordlist. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:21:40
It's likely encrypted with your passphrase. Do you know your passphrase? If so this is the easiest way to import it: 
If you do not know your passphrase, but have some idea about what it might be, you can try to brute force it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:16:52
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:00:53
If you would have said that at the first time around 8k, you would've missed the rise to 11k. It's impossible to predict and waiting for a pull back is not guaranteed to be the best solution.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:47:27
I've used it. No issues. You should really use a hardware wallet for any substantial amount of coins.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:19:46
Do you have the encrypted private key? It starts 6P....
If you have that and the passphrase then yes, yes you can. 
1) 
2) Hit skip. Then there is a validate button top right.
3) Paste in your encrypted key and password
4) There is your unencrtpted public key
5) Import into your favorite wallet
6) spend
I would try these with a fake account to see if you can do it before sending more to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:35
Yup. Whales are back. Broke through 13600 resistance. Now 10MM buy walls on gdax pushing us up. 14.5k
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:51:59
try importing it into a desktop wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:57:10
Your math is way off. 12.5 BTC is about 200k. 200k needed every 10min. 1.2m an hour. 30 mil a day. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:48
Haha. I know. Most of this post is making fun of people who didn't hodl! But in all honesty we have big players moving back in. Might really be the end of the crash. Much bigger money than yesterday 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:31:30
Don't try to time the market. Just buy $x every month. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:46:51
File -&gt; receiving addresses -&gt; new is how you create new ones. That will also be a list of your public addresses and then can check on blockchain.info the balance.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:29:19
You're right. 2048 it seems! Even more secure!
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:13:39
Nope, sadly not.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:30:28
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:57:43
Hey man- I can help you brute force this. Shouldn't be hard. Let me know if interested - no need to send me the words, ill help you write the script (I already have many of these similar scripts written). I need to know exactly how you created the addresses (what service, what encryption etc) and I'll get working.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:26:30
A bubble implies it's over valued and only growing due to hype. Many believe gold parity is coming soon and it will replace gold as a store of value. Hence I think it's true value is 15x from here. Short term it could go down 80% but no one knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:34:29
You paid 3000 sats/byte which is 30x more than was needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:23:37
Do you have the wallet.dat file? What software did you use to create the wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:21:19
No tether printed today. This doesn't explain it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:41:12
Network is congested. You can transfer from gdax for free. But if you don't need to send hold off for a bit. Fees will decrease. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:17:22
If you are worried just send the coins from ledger to another address you own and then finally to an exchange when you cashout. There's no way to know when the coins came into your possession. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:54:56
Price went up 1k. And the trading engine is fine and functioning. Cboe website is not the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:10:03
If you think there maybe a lot of change address, I've found using the listaddressgroupings can be helpful in the console. That is just public addresses so no password needed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:36:22
All aboard!! Bought more at 11.2k. Hodl the line! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:58:37
My understanding is yes. The bt2 futures went up about 500% after s2x was uncancelled. That's assuming that there is actually a fork... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:36:41
BTG is at the original addresses prior to you sending it to your new wallet. Where did you park your coins at the time of the fork? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:01:57
Yes. If you have the seed. Other options include hardware recovery tools to scan for the deleted files.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:51:29
You need to brute force the password. Do you remember any of it? What about the length? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:10:51
Hmm. Did it say which word? Or was it generic?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:32:56
Change all your passwords. You may even need to consider that your phone has been compromised. Maybe even need a new phone number.
Doesn't hurt to contact coinbase and see what's up. Would be interesting if they knew the 2FA code. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:23
As long as you know your 12 or 24 word seed you can recover all funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:14:30
Are the words on this list? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:12:39
You can use electrum. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:04:34

@_date: 2017-12-26 01:01:48
Honestly dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:41:53
Blockchain.info used a 65k word list in version 3 of their seed algo. 
 
You can use  to recover it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:10:11
Thanks man! Goodluck. Let me know if you need more help, I can little rig up that javascript for you if needed.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:46:14
Can you explain exactly what you did to encrypt it back in 2015? Bip38 encrypted keys start 6P - yours is U2. You probably didn't use Bip38.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:22:06
Resend coins to a new address with a higher fee. Whichever goes through first will become permanent. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:19
You can buy litecoin. Send litecoin to the exchange then buy neo. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:46
If the 12 words seed is the universal BIP39 protcol (which it should be if it was created after 2013) then many wallets can import. Electrum is very easy, which is why I recommended it. Download and install then when you set up a wallet there is an option to say you have a seed. Once there do to advances and select the BIP39 protocol. This will import all your bitcoins. Send those bitcoins to a new wallet (this is mostly just a safety precaution). For your permanent wallet get a hardware wallet (I use nano s). To get your Bcash, install electrum cash and do the same as above. Let me know if you need more help!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:28:10
I don't think there were any password requirements, but hard to confirm. What is the name of your wallet back-up file? Did you create it on blockchain.info or another service?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:09:40
More sellers than buyers
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:11:31
Thanks! This will be great to spread the cheer of bitcoin. Reminds me of the old Bitcoin tipping back in the day. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:45:39
Personally I'd cash out. Fiat is becoming worthless, this is a good time to cash out your fiat into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:51:20
Do you have a wallet.dat file from your old bitcoin-qt days? You can also check on blockhain.info how much is in your public address.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:47:20
Nope. This is wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:12:17
You may have been hacked. Both the addresses you sent to have subsequently spent the coins. I've seen spyware change the sending to address at the last minute. Or you pasted the wrong address that happened to belong to someone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:35:05
You should be able to view your balance without the password. Did you use the wallet a lot (send / receive) in 2015? If so your coins are likely in "downstream" addresses. It's possible that the backup you found is an older back-up when those later addresses weren't used yet. However, each backup has the next 100 stored. So you need to create new "receiving addresses" in your client. Create about 10-20 then close the client and reopen with -rescan. Google can help you with specific of using -rescan, but i create a shortcut to bitcoin-qt.exe and in the path add -rescan. Let it load up and it should have found all your coins. 
PM me if this didn't work. There are a couple other options! Goodluck.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:36
You won't be able to tell from the transaction ID most likely. Although you can check on blockchain.info to see if the new address still has coins. If it does you need to try to find either a seed (usually 12 words) or a wallet.dat file. Other options are a .json file some of the wallets used. Do you remember if it was on your computer or online?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:03:55
I'm having the exact same issue. What I can find is 6PM EST today the open "for trading on 12/18." I have no idea what that means- potentially the ticker gets listed at 6PM but no trading is allowed until tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:01:40
This comment didn't age well. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:16:51
I think a paper wallet is better for small "novelty" gifts. It's a way to make sure they hold (since getting it out takes some time) and explains more about what bitcoin really is about.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:50:24
Hey Juicy. Is this the exact same computer you used to use? Did you redownload QT or is it the same from before. If it's the same as before on the same computer then the wallet is the same. If it's new you need to go back and try to find the old wallet.dat. Once you have the old one you need to export all the public keys and see if any have value. One option is to go to receiving addresses and paste them into blockchain.info. Is there any value there? I can help more but that's a first start. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:35
Welcome. Hodl on tight 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:07:09
Source? Need proof re: coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:40:35
Okay. found the source code.
Do you know javascript? If so you could create your own script with that code and the word list to see what the output is. I can't tell right now if this is just a way to return a password for blockchain as opposed to really being a way to have all your private keys. I'll continue to look at it a bit later - got to run for a few.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:14:48
I sold at 0.2 BTC per BCH and kept about 25% of my BCH as insurance (in case by some crazy scenario BCH goes up a ton). I would probably sell at least half now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:11:35
Bitfinex is Bitcoin to tether. Tether is 1.03 to 1 usd right now which explains some but not all. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:00:14
You can sell which ever damn coins you want. You don't have to FIFO. The new tax plan might include FIFO but right now it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:27
He's missing the fact you can send from Coinbase to gdax then send to any address for free. Pretty novice mistake here. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:01:33
I know you didn't mean this. But this is basically how Bitcoin futures work. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:50:40
I've been in bitcoin since early 2011, it's impossible to predict the markets. What I tell folks is to invest $x each month. If you want me make a one time purchase, I think now is fine. For all we know it might run to 17k before a pullback or may drop back down to 8k. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:20:39
The chance this person accidentally sent it to a random address that was yours is nearly 0. Did you post that address anywhere? Did you recently move bcash from that address or something? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:27:39
I bought 2 nanos for this purpose. Buy a new nano and test your 24 words. If it restores then you are fine. If it doesn't.... Then you are down to a 50% chance... 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:22:17
This definitely increases you lose your coins. You need to carefully balance the pros and cons of such a method.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:01:46
I would just hodl. You are at a disadvantage from those with lots of money in the game. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:16:55
This short squeeze will be nice :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:40
O well. At least you found it and its not "your fault" now. Also coins are a discount now, I'd consider buying in!
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:08:48
yeah create a new paper wallet with no coins. And see if you can do the procedure to recover the coins. Good to practice before you need to do it with real coins.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:47:09
When you sell on gdax if creates a taxable event. Just like if you sell a stock but don't withdraw to your bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:27:16
You could try to brute force it. I've had success when you know some of the password. For example "I know it's 8 letter all lower case and ends in vgvg". If you have no idea the password you are probably out of luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:53:51
Umm. Nothing happened? It went up 1k in a minute. That's something. Also trading was active even though the website was down. Overall trading volume is embarrassingly low. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:21:28
They are still tied to the electrum wallet. Download electrum cash and import the electrum wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:40:10
Hey- careful sending that wallet to anyone. There are def ways to do it. The python script is one. Let me know if you need someone to walk you through step by step. No need to send wallet to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:54:46
You need an external Bitcoin wallet. Transfer to there first. Then if you want to sell send to an exchange and sell. Then withdraw to your bank account. I'm general transferring from nitrogen to an exchange directly is frowned upon. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:49:42
Is it $5k per coin? Might be able to buy lots of alt coins -&gt; send to another exchange -&gt; withdraw. 
I don't use kraken, but 5k per day is garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:50:40
Many of us mined coins and/or bought on gox without a paper trail. If you state the cost basis of 0 that'd be the safest. There's no requirement to do fifo. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:17:01
Hehe. 8 = 2018. Just confirmed for monthly futures it's the 2nd day before the 3rd Friday at 4pm
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:08:29
Yeah, if it's invalid address it won't sent. What do you mean by half?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:01:08
Do you remember part of the password? Or an idea of the pattern of the password. If so, brute forcing is an option. If you recall nothing, yeah you're fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:01:23
There are 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 total addresses, nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:37
Looks like version 3 of their algo.
Graf in on there. HUGE word list tho. Okay next step is the algo they used. stay tuned.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:51
Could've transferred to gdax then out. Gdax would've covered fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:13:03
you created the passphrase. No character or special requirements. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:23:56
You probably kept them on MtGox. Gox got hacked, you probably lost all your coins.
If you still have your old HDD, search around for any bitcoin software. Did you even download a wallet to your desktop?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:56:48
Do you remember any of the password? Or have some guesses? Ive written custom software to help people brute force lost password. You need to know some of the password tho or its impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:46:12
In electrum what happens when you go to import -&gt; private keys and paste in the private key? Don't do sweep yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:11:32
Maybe. There is a universal protocol for seeds - BIP39. If the wallet was before that protocol them maybe, if it was after it should work in almost any wallet. It's not wallet-specific. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:26:19
Haha. I hope you are joking! If not, create a new wallet and transfer the funds over.
I would write down the 24 words on 2 different pieces of physical paper.  Cut each one in half. Store in 4 separate secure locations. 
You want to make sure if your house burns down you can still recover the key. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:00:17
Honestly, the big players are doing this and with fees it's nearly impossible for the little guys.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:44:30
Actually. 17 words will return a 128 bit string (word 17 is a checksum and each of the 16 words is coded to 1 byte (8 bits)). That's probably the private key! 
Edit: forgot you had 21 works. It will still return a string, lets see what is it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:13:53
Dang. Sorry didn't see this right away. Yeah they are gone now. In the future if you would have sent all the coin in your wallet to another address and that went through first, when the original transaction was being verified it would show 0 coins and be rejected.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:59:04
This is exciting! Are you sure that the screenshot is of the entire seed? Is it possible that you only have 21 of 24 words? BIP39 uses 12 or 24 words and was created in 2013. If it's from a universal protocol you can import in... although 21 words I haven't seem before.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:33:20
In the client I believe you can do backup wallet and then see where its saving. Replace that with your old wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:32:48
1024^12 combinations. As hard as cracking the private key to any public address. So no. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:12:40
This has been a super common topic. There are two options -&gt; one is to just buy it all now. There is no way to predict the future. I had friends at 3k say they will buy the next dip... they ended up buying in at 7k since that dip never happened. We may go to 16k before we pull back again. And how much of a dip are you waiting for?
The 2nd option is to buy $1k in BTC a week (or month) for 12 weeks (or 12 months). That way it's much smoother a transition in case it does dip.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:08:57
Haha. I bet blockchain used their own algorithm back then. We need to try and find the source code and word list. I'll see what I can dig up.

Replying here to remind myself to look into this when I get home. Usual to brute force passwords you need to recall some info regarding the password. Any sense of pattern? Length?

2nd later scaling. Also fees were sub $1 as recently as a month ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:31:19
Congrats man! That's a great accomplishment. We will see you again soon, I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:48:59
It's probably 12 words plus a passphrase. The passphrase is usually a word you make up. Do you have the 12 words in order and know which is the passphrase? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:51:28
Woohoo! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:02:10
As long as you have your 12 word seed you are fine! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:18:43
Doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:24
Do you have the 12 word backup? What format is the "key" in? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:12:48
Make a copy of the file in case something gets screwed up. 
Option 1: rename as wallet.dat and load the Bitcoin client. 
If that doesn't work download a hex editor and open up the file. Do you see any text with "key"? If so you can extract your keys. 
Hope that helps!

Do you happen to know about what version of Electrum you were originally using? If it was before 2.0 we may need a different approach.

to rescan make a shortcut and add -rescan at the end. PM me if you have more issues, happy to get this working for you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:08
My guess is you wrote down the wrong 12 words. Or the order is wrong. The 12 words are based on BIP39. Do some reading on it then would download another wallet and try restoring.

Trading fees. GDAX is 0.2% if you are the taker (market order).

It should be when 10,000 pizzas cost 1 bitcoin. Don't bring fiat into this

When you open the bcash ledger make sure you choose a new wallet from your seed. I think they call it "split" on the device. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:22:03
Paper wallets should really just be used to store coins, not doing lots of transactions. You have to import the private key to send, and if your computer is compromised that private key can be used to drain your account. 
I would use a hardware wallet if you plan to transact. 
You can continue to send to the paper wallet to add value. 
You will create change depending on the wallet you are using to send. Most wallets use change so that is an issue with you paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:58:30
I can try this. Did you have a system for remembering the password? This may help reduce the combinations to brute force. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:07:54
There's a lot of good info in this thread already. You can dump the private keys without waiting to sync then import them (both to a Bitcoin and bcash client). You need the password to dump the keys. I can help set up a brute force of your pw if you need. PM me if you need more help! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:43:52
That's fine then. As long as you are sending from the account to that paper wallet you won't create change. When you're ready to cash out you can send from the paper wallet to an exchange. I would practice with a small amount of BTC on another paper wallet to make sure you can do it / know the procedure.

Feel free to down vote me! I've helped folks recover lost coins when we needed to brute force part of the password. This takes programming and cpu/gpu time - so I now ask for optional tips when helping out. Agree this case didn't need any processing power so understand your concern. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:23:50
The 12 word seed should generate the same exact addresses. What address is showing 10% of the funds? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:01:55
Multibit is no longer supported. Here is a tool to get your private key!  
PM me if you can't get it to work! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:30:01
Don't stress. You are fine. The 12 word recovery phrase is not wallet specific. Download your favorite wallet - on android I use Coinomi. Hit recover wallet. Type in your recovery phrase. You should see your coins. I recommend using a hardware wallet in the future for extra security. 
If you suddenly become a millionaire after recovering your coins I would love a small tip. I'm trying to start a service for folks who need to recover lost bitcoins. Thanks! 1PBYt7BjYocs7LWEE5BrqXDBxgP6W9iJKK
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:15:50
You are in luck! The 12 word seed is a rather universal protocol. Download your favorite wallet ( in android you can use Coinomi or similar). Select restore wallet. It will then ask for the 12 words. Input and you are done! 
If you happen to become a millionaire with your new found coins a small tip is appreciated! 1PBYt7BjYocs7LWEE5BrqXDBxgP6W9iJKK

Did it ever even have the 0.5 bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:37:56
You can check the public address on any blockchain explorer - such as blockchain.info 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:39:25
Ahh that makes sense now. It means those addresses won't be backed up with you seed. Get your coins to a hardware wallet asap
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:26:11
Following those BTC it goes into wallets with &gt;10MM USD. This mean it's likely an exchange, but can't easily tell which one. Suspect, your hacker may have transferred to some exchange. Would try to figure out which one and contact them / file a police report.
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:33:35
If you post the full key, I'm happy to write a script try all the smudge combos. Only do that if you thinks there is nothing. If there may be a decent amount, shoot me a PM and we can come up with an agreement. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:52:33
Of course. Hit me up when you need me. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:42:34
Hey man. Let me know if you still need help. I have experience brute forcing when you remember most of a password. I have custom optimized software for BIP38 which jack the ripper doesn't support (last I looked) with access to decent computing power. If found I usually ask for about 15%. Let me know if interested! 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:47:33
Hey man. Do you remember the first 19 words? If you know those and potentially could think of a couple possibilities for the last 5 we have a shot at brute forcing. Let me know if you want to explore this option
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:38:39
Not necessarily. At least in the US since crypto is classified as an asset and not a security you can't get trader status with crypto. Given that you can deduct your cypto losses againts other capital gains, however you can only deduct $3000 in losses against your ordinary income (ie what you get from work). If you have more than net negative $3k you can roll it forward to next year.
