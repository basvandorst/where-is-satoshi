Gold will keep rising as the USD keeps dropping (more than 10% this year). About gold being valued solely by perception; gold is a metal used in MANY technical application. I can't "build" computer chips with BTC. But I can with gold.

why do reporters think: "Bitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible." Clearly it is not with all them dark market runners and tax evaders being caught. ?
