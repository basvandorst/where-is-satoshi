Not sanitizing the email from HTML isn't incompetence. It poses zero security risk. Yeah, it might be a good idea if they checked that the email is in a valid format, but it's not a threat.

Your website is malware. Report this guy.

Not in this case. Yes, it could cause harm if email addresses were publicly displayed somewhere on the site (so that you could send cookies to a remote server effectively stealing peoples' logins, an [XSS vulnerability](  but that isn't the case here.

He claims he's 17 in 2011 here: 
Yes, that's his real HN account.
@_date: 2012-08-12 18:16:27
My fault. My point still remains though, these people are young.
@_date: 2012-08-24 16:47:16
Agreed. Also the "proof" he provided is simply that they don't sanitize **client-side HTML**.
**TL;DR This guy is full of shit.**

Nope, not implying anything. Just asking a question.
@_date: 2012-08-13 01:58:31
Nope, not arguing that. I've been following bitcoin for about 1.5 years now and have somewhat of an understanding. I remember when it was $25+ not too long ago.

I don't go on Something Awful and never have.
@_date: 2012-08-12 18:03:36
What? I'm not arguing anything. Where are you even getting this?

There's a special place in hell for people that don't label their axes.

I ran it in Sandboxie and nothing really happened except a popup came up saying I could now securely connect to MtGox, but file and internet access were blocked from it. Going to decompile it later today.

Why is this in @_date: 2011-06-20 12:16:11
Can you upload the file? I'd like to take a look at what it does in an isolated environment.
@_date: 2011-08-10 21:40:19
Not to be a buzzkill, but you'll be spending a lot more on the power bill than you will be gaining from the bitcoins, considering that it's not even an ATI/AMD card.
@_date: 2011-12-22 21:25:13
uh yes it will. Will it run it well? Debatable.
