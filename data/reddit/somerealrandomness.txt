House keeping in the USA tends not to pay well. Better to find something you would like to do that is as esoteric as reasonably possible. The rarer the job the harder it is to find people for it. This rarity tends to pay more. For example A doctor tends to take about 10-15 years worth of work (sometimes a lot more) And tends to pay well. A manual labor example landscaping, or janitorial work tends to have little or no training, easy to find people and tends to pay little comparatively.

The issue is not being able to get it. The issue is getting it "legally" through the regulatory, golden, and gilded cage. The regulatory framework is rather grey right now, mostly due to custodial issues...

A few guys with guns are proof that PoS is well... POS... 
@_date: 2017-04-15 22:15:21
An Issue is there is not any external stake with PoS. All "stakes" are internal to the system. This lack of external proof or commitment has yet to show it can scale, and handle issues of external threats. One issues well discussed is the range attacks there are other attacks that use other consensus forking methods, like mine every chain. This is not mitigated with any useful PoS system at this time. In a POW system you "stake" and external proof of power. POW will works to maintain consensus by "punishing" wrong or invalid stakes as spending lots of external cost for a non consensus state, or non usable state. One useful feature I would surmise is not having often re-targets, this penalizes that witch would fork the chain.

@_date: 2018-03-14 14:10:26
My argument more stems from collecting endless personal identifiable information, as the endless number of mega breaches is making it easier and easier to circumvent both KYC/AML and ID checks. I my opinion, the ability to secure large amounts of data is the more dangerous issue, and AML/KYC is getting more and more useless.

In the context of the 'cloud' there is a speed issue when you need to move instance from the current 'pod' to a new one that has loads less load. This requires time directly proportional to how large in resources, and exacerbated by how currently over loaded your instance is. Most non-impacting moves are very slow, most~ impacting moves are pretty quick. It ends up looking like this, copy disk then catch up the writes, then copy memory catch up the writes, then pause the vm and restart it in it current state at the new location. The down time on this 'live' move is less than a second even when moving data centers, but takes hours sometimes to setup for the 'move'. In a 'impacting' move its much faster as you just turn off the vm, copy data, restart vm. As you can see, alot less going on, but can be down for several minuets, maybe longer if copying massively large data sets.
