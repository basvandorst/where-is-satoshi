Thanks so much for all your comments, I am attempting to address them on the  site as they appear!

Thanks, whoisonline, for your kind appeal...
While I'm not at all inclined to jump off a bridge, it has been devastating and discouraging to loose 200 BTC on Gox... :(
I've been trying to cope by appealing for some BTC (so far, have been sent 1 Satoshi - LOL!) but I'm blogging about my feelings, history, plans, and etc. almost daily.
I think that my blog might eventually be valuable to other MtGox victims as well, and I also hope to develop some new approaches to securing Bitcoin wallets... So, if you visit my site, please don't harsh me for having put my hand out?
Thanks again for your sympathy! :)

Can you point to such a trustworthy charity? I would be glad to donate the  domain to such an entity.

I lost 200 BTC on MtGox. Don't know if my story is typical or not... I should have started migrating the coin to a private wallet back in August last year when I heard news that feds had frozen $ accts... but my wife was really sick, and my time was consumed with caring for her.
&lt;Deep sigh&gt;
And so, there went my plans for any kind of retirement! But I'm not quitting, not giving up on coin, still plan to create new and good things and exchange them for coin! Good luck to y'all!

As time has gone by and I've further processed what has been done to me and so many others by MtGox, I have taken this experience and other comments to heart.
I've "rebranded"  and completely changed the emphasis to a fair exchange of value for Bitcoin.
Thanks to all for their feedback!
