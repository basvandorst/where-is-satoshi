It’s a pump before the fork. Will hot 1000 probably. 1200-1500 with news like coin telegraph saying it will take over the btc name next year.

I don’t get it. Everyone wants a crypto currency to control their own money and not letting the banks control it. Meanwhile they pile into a coin that is not controlled by banks, just large computing pools that have shown that they can cripple the network anytime they feel by switching their computational power away from that coin. ASICS are a problem. Not only can you not even buy one today without getting a used up version that a company/pool has already abused for the profits, the newest models goto large pools in charge of deciding the fate of the coin and your money. that’s not getting away from the control of banks, that’s just shifting it to mining pools. 
Check out Vertcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:03:14
Correct sir. Yes because of bitcoin controlling the majority of the crypto world, mining has fallen upon ASIC requirements to turn profits which in turn kind of centralizes the network. Blocks can’t be mined without massive pools and computational power provided by the ASIC devices.  Therefore the mass sales of gpu’s has fallen as well.  When altcoins rise and gain more power over the market, GPU cards will rise again though. 
That’s why I set a little interest in Vertcoin and being able to stay ASIC resistant for future prevention of market controllability. 
Just my 2 satoshi.

Third this.  Simply because banks are on to Coinbase. My account was recently closed for trying to wire funds to Coinbase, I think Gemini would have slid right past them though.

Proof time and time again, crime DOES pay.
This guy has to goto jail for a few years, he will be in Seg because of his law enforcement career, the guards will look favorably upon him and special treatment will be provided to him.
What's that saying.. "Live some years unlike others so that you can live the rest.."
6 years for  a couple million dollars... yeah.. Id take that prison sentence as well knowing I would only serve max 70% of the sentence due to "good behavior".   Even at the current rate of of btc.. he stands to make a million if he only kept 150 btc.
This legal system is a joke, this dickhead should be held to the "Higher Standard" they all preach about but never enforce.  Hopefully he gets killed and we wipe those coins off at a known loss therefore increasing the BTC price.  If they gave Ross life, this fucker deserves no life.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:33:13
And they will keep waiting as the hashing power has been moved to BCH. Bitcoin requires expensive ASICS to run and those devices are controlled by large pools, most of them in China right now. For a currency that doesn’t want oversight, it got it sort of. Just as bitcoin is considered pseudo anonymous via addresses, it is also Pseudo controlled as there is no government to control it, just large pools of miners that can switch power to a new coin when they want and abandon all future progress of bitcoin. 
Bitcoins money is coming in because of media buzz, but the network that wins will be the one that can complete the fastest transactions and not be controlled by an entity that decides its fate. 
Check out Vertcoin. 
Just my opinion though. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:58:25
Well I guess the only problem there is using the same address multiple times. I believe this is a no no as far as bitcoin goes and from what I read about quant computing, would make future attacks on wallets easier.

Dealer on the Darkweb, besides most major outlets were transferring their BTC to fiat asap due to the volatility.  There were even posts from the delaers on certain message boards asking thier customers to please finalize asap so that they could receive their coins to place back into fiat when DNM's were big.

Stick with original flavored BTC. Take the splits and sell or HODL if scared of them taking over the network. Hence the 1:1 split.

I had BoA for years before I got tired of their bullshit.  Closed my account,  had a 1$ annual recurring fee pop on like day 29 after the close.  they reopened my account to pay the $1 charge, then charged me a $30 overdraft fee, then an additional $45 fee for reopening the account.  Told them to properly "f off" over the phone and refused to pay the debt.  to this day I don't think I can open a BoA account from outstanding debt.  Didnt hurt my credit score and went to USAA and never looked back.  F BoA!

Im feeling the fork, if implemented has the possibility of increasing the volatility in an upwards trend. Perhaps like Bitcoin Cash we will see a going get a great return overnight in which investors are quick to sell and return to the safety of their bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:58:37
Await the upcoming news in the next two months.  Bitcoin will drop again to a more respectable level.  Then purchase and trade through the drops/swings.  
Pay attention for forks because getting in early for a fork can generate some quick cash if needed (Bitcoin Cash) which can be utilized to purchase more BTC for the HODL and ever increasing nest egg.

Spent a year in Namibia and I love these articles.  Standard Bank, one of Namibia's largest financial institutions would charge people money to deposit, money for monthly maintenance, money for withdraws (whether in person or at an ATM, even their own bank's atms) and anything else that used their services.  They were essentially "nickeling and diming" for every transaction.

Correct me if I’m wrong but one technology, and I believe deceit pushes to take the power out of miners hands and keep the fees low in the future. Once mining has been eliminated, transaction fees will be the only source of income within the network for them. 
So essentially if fees are too low miners may decide to set their own levels in another back room deal and essentially create a higher fees system. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:42:51
Yes, and at the low levels it represents now it can be used. The one thing I'm concerned about and factor in is long term growth and federal regulation. Thinking we are undercutting the banks and taking them out of the picture  is forgetting that in doing so, we have the potential to cut out the biggest banker in the US, the IRS. Taxing of Bitcoins was quickly adapted but for how long until Uncle Sam realizes you are able to hide your currency in a safe method  (being no stores of cash in your mattress) nor anything that can be seized, before they realize they are at a chance of financial loss as well. 
Banks and politics have been shaking hands and playing in each other's sandboxes for a long time. Taxes are imposed at banks which allow federal taxes to be established as well. Hurting one hurts the other and banks will be quick to remind the government if the problem becomes to much of a loss. 
It's really pissing off authorities that. Crypto currencies, though traceable, through the blockchain are a way for criminals to securely store their funds if needed.  Not just criminals, essentially anyone can begin hiding fund for tax sheltering purposes  The days of busting into a kingpins house and finding millions in plastic wrapped cash may be coming to an end and if I recall, that's a major financial boost for authorities. 
I guess what I'm saying is that, bitcoin can get big, but I'm in fear that the powers in control can easily crush it if needed by outlawing it in easy cooperation with the banks. Once the realize the potential loss of revenue, they can squash it easily through laws that will be passed in back rooms and enforced on the streets. It's been done before. 
Think of this. What's stopping someone now from maxing out credit cards on exchanges, taking loans on everything and buying bitcoin. Then declaring bankruptcy, flipping the middle to the bank for 7 years with bad "credit", another organization they control, and starting over.  Enough people doing this would cause hell to banks and become the ultimate return of favor for the financial crisis they put us through recently.

Yes. I agree. The technology for public view of all transactions makes its implementation in some situations ideal. But as of now, the value of the currency is connected to a fiat currency which is physical and requires banks and such to store.

His past deeds aside, Mr. Assange is in a position to prop up and better his position with Ecuador right now.  Depending upon the amount of money he made off BTC, he could heavily promote the use of the currency and make Ecuador on of the first countries switching over to and utilizing crypto currencies therefore pushing them into the future of currency exchange in the world.  
Think about what Russia is doing with their national crypto currency.  Some laugh at it and say it will fail but if the US did the same thing we could eliminate fiat currencies and the costs associated with them.  How much money is spent alone PRINTING money because the bills get destroyed from use.  The penny in the US is'nt even worth 1 cent anymore because it costs more to make it.  
If a country were to switch to a crypto currency, make it decentralized so that citizens can run a full node to protect the integrity of the currency it would only benefit them in the long run.  Setting up simple government offices where citizens could come in and get a crypto wallet that would be assigned to them using blockchain technology and store this on a public ledger.  Accountability would then be accomplished as tracing transactions would be possible as it is today on the blockchain.

Pfft.  Explained bitcoin to my parents two months ago.  Told my mom when it was at $2300 that we each need to take 10k and invest.  Her incompetence has her seeing 1 article where banks are against it and not allowing transactions and she grabs ahold of that to counter the argument like her life depended on it.  Meanwhile I'm up 200% and she is still saying I make poor decisions with my money.
this coming from the woman who insists on going to the bank to drop off checks 3x a week when I've shown her PNC's quick deposit app on her phone at least ten times.

I understand what you mean as it is long term for the technology.  The technology is great but if you recall from Swell, there were representatives that stated though the technology is sound, XRP is not needed.  this is my opinion, take it for what it's worth.  It seems that financial institutions would want a currency/coin thats value stays current and can't be manipulated by outside factors such as public interest.  I was totally on board with XRP and loved the idea of it being marketed to banks, its a way to get them on board with crypto currencies given their distaste for bitcoin.  More specifically it attacks much needed issue of replacing lengthy ACH and wire transfers.

Im reading further into the technology and thoughts like quantum computing and the damage it will has the potential to cause financial scares and therefore lowering in price in which bitcoin will be involved.  Then I think how a quantum network will need to be implemented to increase security and provide almost instant transaction speeds and verification.
In the end, to me, I believe the bitcoin's value will increase prior to the effects of quantum computing networks and the infrastructures (faster internet speeds via google fiber and such) make a newer version of the coin with better encryption through quantum computing technology an almost instant transaction possible speed.  If people lose faith in the performance and security of a network it loses value and might migrate to better protocols in the future once available.

During this fork I'm not betting/investing on the technology of the coin, I'm more focused on the groups of investors that will appear before/during/after the fork.  For example
Prior to the fork as you see now there is a bunch of hype and a basic feud going on between the two main groups (/bitcoin and /btc) about which coin is best. Seeing as the btc gold (BTG) investors will still need to invest in regular BTC to get their coins there will be a pump again prior to the fork.
Once the split happens, you will see multiple groups appear:
*Advantagers:  Those who sell off their BTG quickly to reinvest in BTC to get in before the the new pump.
*True Believers:  Those who sell off their BTC to invest in BTG because they believe the technology is better (some /BTC people will be here)
*Ignorant/Unacknowledged:  Those who bought BTC just for the split and will hodl both either because they don't know how to get their new coins or they just invested in BTC for the split and will HODL long term.
IMO, BTC will still prevail over BTG but it's going to have a few pumps from the split that will further push the price, therefore creating more media attention and bringing in future investors.
Once the gains from the split are to be made  There will be a couple more groups that appear.
*Altcoiners:  these people will take their BTG, convert to BTC, then take those profits and move back into altcoins that serve some type of functional purpose (i.e. Ripple/Ethereum).
The split is going to be a money making event as anyone that has invested enough time/knowledge into the last fork will know it is basically free money. As to how much depends on your market strategy.
Personally Im buying into some altcoins now as I think a percentage of the money from the split will naturally flow back into these markets.  People on these forums talk all day about "lambos" and "to the moon" but those days for bitcoin are over and the only way to achieve those types of gains are through altcoins at low prices.

I dont think coinbase charges for BTC transfers out of their system.  Only purchases.  Its cheaper to purchase on GDAX, but transfers jsut pay the tx fee.

I am hoping you're not letting your opinion of the coin influence your opinion of the design of their subreddit
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:51:57
I don't believe you are correct, with the current difficulty, it would take a shit ton of time for GPU's to mine a block.  therefor seeing as each block is made of transactions, the network would come to a grinding halt and people would be waiting forever for their tx's to be verified.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:34:58
Still need banks though until bitcoin becomes a truly usable currency.  In that I mean that it is accepted as common as the dollar.  Until then, people will still be utilizing banks to hold fiat.
Most people watch the price and think about all of the dollars it is worth.  People are buying bitcoin now with hopes that it will "moon" and they can convert it back to dollars...  I take it as the price will go down if it finally does blow up as people will be cashing out for fiat, then relying on banks to hold this fiat for them.

thanks for all the comments so far.  Even investing 40k in coins now to buy close to 10 wouldn't pan out for the year?  Im 35, so Ive got time to make up for it and its not my only retirement fund (as I stated, multiple options to include Fed retirement)
I see what youre saying regarding day trading, for instance, if I bought 12 coins today at the open $3200, I would have already made over 8k in a few hours from the current price, minus the taxes.

Korea and other Asian markets waking up to the low prices/news..... Pump incoming.
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:14:55
I'm looking for the same information as I plan to purchase some as well.
There are a few that I know of:
GDAX - The market/exchange of CoinBase.  You can buy coins there transferring in funds.  Also, if you do a little research, you can essentially get your coins for new fee through "Maker's" fees.
Gemini - Just tried to get into this market earlier but their registration was currently under maintenance.  heard this is a location as well that has lower fees.
With those being the two that I know of, excluding Poloniex as there are negative posts recently pooping up about them.
I do have some further questions though.
There are also ways of procuring Tether for transacting a 1:1 USD crypto-currency.  I have yet to do my full research on this buy essentially, once you get your fiat converted to a Tether coin, just trade it for BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-03 08:57:27
I started thinking about this as well and I would appreciate some clarity on the subject if possible.  What exactly happens to the blockchain in the future when mining which is now left to large corporations, countries, etc. becomes ineligible for profit.
  Some say they will move to a more profitable coin.  If that is the case, then what is pumping out the new blocks besides transaction fees from a network with a much slower speed and less computational power behind it...
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:32:26
please correct me.  People with GPU's are basically unable to mine BTC from what I've read and been informed of due to the complexity an the amount of time required to find a new block.  That is why pool mining was created.  ASICS mine at an incredible rate compared to GPU's, which is why mining companies now use them to mine for BTC.

When bitcoin reaches those levels from Wall Street involvement, it will be seen as a store of value more then it is today. Also, by that time implementation of the lightning network and other technological improvements  will reduce fees for user transfers. If you are regarding to the fees from the trades the investors make, there won’t be any really as they will be playing the markets with limit orders and such.

Aww shit, my alphabay days are coming back to me. You can use a couple methods but nothing is really guaranteed however doing the following should distance yourself far away enough to not cause a stir. 
Send to multiple wallets. 
Create a couple wallets and transfer your coins from one to another. About 2 away from the exchange should be good. Just make sure if you are doing this repeatedly that you use different receiving addresses. 
Currency changes
Shift from your exchange to a wallet like electrum. Then shift your coins into another currency using Shapeshift or  changelly. Changelly imo because the creator of shapeshift supports BTG and for that he’s a dick (just my opinion). Swappem back to BTC in another wallet and handle your business.

Some people don't like his business practices but in the end, that's what governments do.  China pulls the same shit and so do other countries, the only difference being they control their media and don't let their shady transactions slip out while at the same time making sure to inflate news of any US dealings.

Read more into it.  Do some google searches about the hardforks and their proposals and you will see what they are trying to do.  Bitcoin was shifted to ASICS basically because GPU's couldn't keep up.  With the current hashrate and difficulty to mine, it would be damn near impossible to mine BTC with a GPU rig.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:01:20

Ripple has promise though from what I read it is not what some others think. People are seeing the low price $.25 and purchasing large sums thinking it will multiply like bitcoin did.

I'm too old for tantrums, made a bold title to gain users attention within the community to support this idea  If implemented, this will provide an easy point of reference for newcomers to read up and eliminate a majority of the reoccurring posts that continue to appear on a daily basis.  Even your sideline rules state the following:
*Please avoid repetition — is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system.*
This should be a simple way to keep the new posts informative about the current state of Bitcoin while removing most of the clutter.

What charge would “failure to crumble under our pressure and give up all of his profits by giving us his private keys”

Do you mean another wallet on the same hardware or another address within that wallet?
Like if you got a trezor and you have different accounts, then yes, sending from one account (wallet) to another will work.  
however if you only have 1 account/wallet, sending to another address on that wallet wont really do anything besides make you wait 45 mins for to to become .0008 btc poorer.

Honestly GTCode, When I woke up earlier and say the 5900 price I transferred and sold at 5980.  Saw it spike again to 6075 ish and though "Shit!".  Luckily I set a buy limit of 5940 and got back in and plan on hodling until the split.  
I believe you are wrong if you think now is the time to be on alert, most knowledgeable people understand the fork is coming and today is PAYDAY nigga! so people are buying in!

So sat down, watched a youtube video and made about 60 bones in the last 45 minutes.  It keeps flipping between  6040 - 6070 at times.  time it right and you can hit the sweet spots.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:24:51
yup, electrum will let you set the fees. check out   to see whatwhat the current fees now and send them low.  Doesnt matter how long they take to go through when sending wallet to wallet unless your in a rush.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:31:16
Thats a good question and I think I saw the answer for that before but I forgot.  Honestly, I never really set it that low.  I have seen how some people said it took 8+ hours because they set such a low fee.  For me, the economy/normal setting was fine for what I was doing.  Sending $100 worth of bitcoin and having a $1.50 fee wasnt killing me.  That was on "Normal" setting I think and I always got my shit in under an hour.  IF the person is checking their wallet they don't need 3 confirmations for the most part.  They will be fine with one, shit as long as I scanned their QR code and hit sent, most of the time they were contempt with that.  (don't do that if you're buying)
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:50:09
No, not the amount of miners involved but the complexity of the hashing/encryption needed to find a new block.  Blocks are found once every 10 minutes or so with the current miners.  basically the miners with their ASIC machines are doing a shit ton of math problems to find the algorithm for the new block.  Once found they are rewarded with coins (12.5) I believe.  As the problems get harder, the equipment needed to mine/do the problems must use more energy (electricity).  Bitcoin was mineable by GPU's back in the day (2011-2012) but as the complexity increased to find new blocks, the GPU's were unable to keep up, so therefore ASIC's were introduced.  The can do math problems 1000x times more efficient then a GPU.
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:03:35
Well I wouldn't go as far as to say the network wouldn't still be secure, as the technology behind it is still sound, SegWit2x, will call into play what some may consider "an attack" on the BTC network and we will see what happens at the fork.

Coinbase  fees are high but they are also the most reputable company to deal with.  If GDAX is going to trade the new coin on their exchange then place it in Coinbase. If an exchange announces they will support the split then use them. Only if you want to dump the new coin immediately though.

Congrats, you would also have to have been batshit crazy or wealthy enough to not care anyway about that 10k seeing as there was no way of knowing it would balloon to current levels.  Read about the guys who made money of bitcoin like the Winklevoss twins.  I believe they did a low sum in the beginning and just held the coins and they only have 44 million I believe.
basically they bought it, forgot about it for a few years, then were lucky enough to remember their seeds when it mattered ;)  I know of two people specifically (one who tells me almost every day because we still play WoW together from 7 years ago and I recall him saying he bought the coins when he made the purchase, I laughed and went back to raiding Black Temple).  Thing is, he only spent $20, got 400 coins, but over those 7 years, he lost interest and lost his seed... fast forward to today.

That's fine, if you want to regulate me like a bank, then I want to pay the same taxes as a bank.. which is next to nothing.   These shitbirds in office want to take cash from anyone they can, hence bitcoin being labeled as a commodity instead of what it is.. and what it is clearly defined as from the start, a currency.  Hence their capital gains taxes.  I don't even shed a tear when these assholes get their lives threatened, in the end they deserve it.

Yes. I’m an IT tech and that is a good description from your opinion if you are concerned if you understood it correctly. 
I read it and it can be taken as segwit2x will caus rupiah spend bitcoin and if it is a 1:1 split, like BCash was, you’ll be essentially sending free btc. Seems like a dangerous implementation and could be conceived as a takeover of the block chain if widely implemented and used. 
I’m forseeing a big drop and halt to trading when the fork happens. I know I’ll be icing my coins down and keeping my eyes open.

If it truly moons, you will have bigger problems to think about such as the government banning its use altogether. Dimon stated an important thing to think about, big brother likes to know where the money is going and who has it. That knowledge is power and one of the highest in the world as it gives governments control over their populations. 
Think about it, what would/could you do if Uncle Sam made bitcoin and crypto currencies illegal tomorrow and forbid their use under some regulation? They don’t really need a reason other then to regurgitate what’s already been said of how it contributes to money laundering, crime, etc.  
If you were unable to cash it out, Coinbase and exchanges were shutdown you’d be “tits up”.  All of this talk of it “going to the moon” and people buying “lambos” as they dream of bitcoin hitting 50-100k are from, in my opinion, starry eyed individuals. The days of becoming a millionaire off bitcoin are close to over. At 5k a coin, you would only see a 10x profit at what is now seen as the highly speculative price point.  
The millionaires already got in and out of bitcoin and while there is still a profit to be made, it is nowhere near what individuals on this forum are believing in. You’d have to buy 500k worth of bitcoin now to even hit a million when it doubles to 10k per coin (which I believe it will”
For it to go into the 50k range in a few years would mean you would be greatly interfering with the banking industry, and that’s old money, with old friends that are in politics.

Not rip altcoins, invest in the ones you believe in because after the fork, the prices will see a surge again.  People are dumping all pins but look where the money is going. Into bitcoin for the split. They will se a rise again afterwards. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:38:13
I mean if I held that many coins and could safely retire woth enough fiat I would. People that bought bitcoin at $1, even $100 have enough coins now that they can be millionaires, why wait for the possibility of a bubble when you can get out and live stress free.l through fiat.  Notice the winklevoss twins are millionaires because they sold (some, probably not all) of their coins and essentially it is what most people on this forum are looking to do. Wait for the price to go up enough to dump and buy “lambos”
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:15:59
Ha. This made me laugh. From what I remember hearing, remember that the US government made owning gold illegal and confiscated all gold people were holding them paid them a measly price for it. They then turned around and raised the value of gold again after they took it all from the people.

Understood, and I fully embrace the idea of bitcoin and electronic currencies as this is technology moving forward.  The mass adoption thing is what we should be seeking for and pushing, not just watching the price go up and down dependent upon speculators opinions.
  Banks wield great power with their global control, you aren't attacking a currency as you are an establishment that has essentially controlled humanity in the background since trading began.  Bitcoins will hold a monetary value but their exchange for large goods once they have risen in such the levels expected would be limited by its acceptance.  Say you want to buy real estate after you've made your money in bitcoin.  A real estate company can advertise they take bitcoin, but the state/federal paperwork would require you to pay in fiat, which you can t get because the banks wont accept the wires from the exchanges that do the conversions. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:22:26
Umm BTC is already being pumped and dumped now. Goto an exchange and look at the order book. That’s essentially people buying btc at one price, waiting for it to hit another level, then dumping and taking the profits. With the volatility in the market, you can make profit each day depending on the size of your investment. 
Also, trust me, you want Wall Street money in bitcoin. You want their massive money to flow into bitcoin, if not to trade but then to at least use btc as a store of value. It will only drive the price up further.

if you really wanted to screw him over, cancel your credit cards and bank accounts.  move to a credit union.  Someone has to store your fiat, make sure its not him nor his associates.
It would only take a day or two to complete everything.  If the bitcoin community did this it has the possibility of creating a movement that will spread with the news of bitcoin price surging therefore accomplishing two tasks at once.  Don't just talk shit about him, he can't hear you.  Show him.

if you wiped your hard drive.  The only suggestion from an IT tech perspective is to spend the cash necessary from a private company to retrieve the data.  If it isn't lost forever.

The swell conference was just that, a swell of XRP the. An immediate dump when everyday the keynote speakers and devs talked about “groundbreaking” news but just regurgitated the same shit that was well known. The only thing that some people were made aware of was that Ripple was pushing their tech, not XRP. Bought in at .26, got out at .22 and never looked back.

IMO it will go down again and people will move back into alt coins.   Noob investors like myself who have been following the news see that a split is coming and whether they fully understand it or not, have been putting their money into btc to take advantage from it like what we saw happen with BCH. Once those coins are sold, if for any value, people will push them back into alt coins awaiting their rise.

This dump is a correction from the ATH you witness over the past week, people bought in, and are now taking profits.  
There are two possible pumps coming that could look like 1 large one.
Buying the dip - happening now, people are seeing the low price and the sellers who took profit are going to buy back in.  Why?  Because its cheap coins prior to the fork.
Forkers - As anticipation rises for the fork, people will be buying in as well to get the free coins that will happen on the 25th.
There could be two separate pumps, or this could be one large one that keeps rising prior to the fork.
Once the fork, people will dump and I believe altcoins with a purpose will receive more attention as the profits will flow back into them.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:28:08

I’m sensing sarcasm but I’ll bite. Yes, you can sell locally but please don’t be foolish. Meet in a public place, get a money pen to check the bills and make sure you bring a friend or something. People are getting robbed this way. 
Simple rules for this procedure would be:
Meet at appropriate times in crowded locations. 
Bring a friend and don’t leave with the cash. Have them bring the car up and pick you up at the door.  Plan your entry and exit points. 
If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  Even repeat buyers can be thieves. 
The reason people want btc with no connections is because they want to use it for illicit purposes. 
Also, not normally mentioned. But make sure you shift your btc into a wallet that is not connected to your exchange accounts. Reason being, btc can be traced, and you don’t want Coinbase seizing,shutting down your account because someone you sold your coins to dumped them on a dark net market.

that's a lil riskier more then usual at this current time I would think.  If it was 4 weeks ago, yeah, Id look for a correction.  But 5 days before the trade and with getting on poloniex all the other altcoins are falling..  I may not know the true reason but my 2 satoshis says that 5 days before a split, alt coins falling while bitcoin is going up would lead one to believe where the market is shifting it's money.  You may see a hundred, maybe two hundred dollar drop over the next few days but I strongly believe the trend will continue upwards until people are afraid to trade due to replay/BTCGold etc.

Also, with the right support, a contest could be held within the community to design new logos and the subreddit with awards provided to the most voted design therefore further influencing the revamp. A contract such as a voting system where a few satoshi’s would get you a vote would raise a little capital to assist. 
Following the competition, the winning design could be made with voters having specific flair, not to mention, high volume voters receiving such merch as shirts, mugs, keychains and stickers with the new logo to further spread the bitcoin logo around their homes.

As a citizen and patriot of the United States, I should be only natural that I put "stock" into my country.  I would expect nothing less from you and your nationality.
On a side note though, I don't believe America is the best.  We have our problems, one being our appearance in other countries.  I spent the last five years working for the Department of State and traveling the world as a diplomat so I have experience in talking to foreign nationals and learned a lot from them as they did from me.
I would often come across other nationalists that would talk badly about American's with no real interaction with one on a personal level.  They would seem to have the perception that all American's represent the beliefs and actions of our government and this couldn't be any further from the truth in most cases.  Our government is shit, the politicians are crooked (and I believe more so in America then most other countries).  I can assure you, when the day comes for a revolution, I will be one of the many charging the gates of congress waiting to drag those assholes out of office and execute them in the street for the crimes they have committed against their people.
Politicians were originally put in place as public servants, it was and still is considered a service to the country but the times have changed and power corrupts.  Gone are the days where appointed individuals would leave their farms/estates to come to the capital in service of thier country, now all you have are assholes that work less then 200 days a year, get paid outrageous salaries, are in  most cases above the laws that they draft and then top it off, receive full retirement benefits after only 4 years of "service".  The whole system is fucked and we need to wipe the board clean with them and thier families blood to ensure future generations learn that when you screw over your citizens, you can and will lose everything you hold of value.
But that's not the case right now.  I spent two years in Malta and at any given time, you could be sitting down for a meal in a restuarant/cafe and a politician would walk in with their family and eat beside you, no security team, no press coverage, no fear.  They sat with the people because they were one of the people.  In the U.S. however, all politicians are given security teams because they know if they were ever alone and recognized they would essentially be killed.  
When you talk about other countries emerging as world powers, I am going to assume you are referring to China as one of them.  Let me provide an example of the shady shit China does.  The U.S. invaded Iraq (I'm a vet, I was there) for some stupid fucking reason noone will explain to this day.  Some say for oil, some say WMD's (never found) and some say to fill a grudge from dickhead Bush Sr by little dickhead Bush Jr.  Either way, we went in, smashed the country to shit and are still rebuilding it to this day.  Meanwhile, while every other country said we did it for the oil, note that China was the one who went in and secured the oil fields after the war was over and have continued to drain the resources while no one bats an eye.
Another example from my experiences was in Namibia in 2015.  the Chinese have a MASSIVE embassy there, like as big as a shopping mall.  Namibians have a real big problem with Chinese people as they come in, open up businesses (being allowed because China lines the pockets of their corrupt leaders) and sell only Chinese goods that are imported.  there is a Coca Cola bottling plant in South Africa (which is a neighboring country and to this day, still very on great diplomatic relations with Namibia even though the country split from S. Africa in '72 I believe).  The Chinese businesses import ONLY Chinese food and products, to include coca cola FROM China that they sell to the Namibians.  the only drive Chinese made vehicles and shop in Chinese owned grocery stores.  Most of them don't use the banking system there as all rand is stored and then shipped out through their channels back to China.  The chinese citizens who are allowed in country to work on visa's for a period of time overstay their visa as long as they can and when they are caught, involved with local police, they are handed back to the Chinese embassy.   
Remember how I said the embassy there was huge, it was because the had housing facilities where the Chinese would put their citizens up, tell the Namibian government that they sent them back to China, then release them to another part of the country to work in another Chinese operated store/business.
Call me a liar if you'd like, but know that I was privileged to the information that most people would not have because of my position in the embassy.
So when you go talking shit about America, know that we are not the greatest evil in the world, only the one with the most publicity because other countries, especially Chinese love to beat the drum and spread the news when something runs afoul that involves the US.
Also pay attention that when shit hits the fan in other countries, who is asked  to aid?  I didnt see China doing shit in Syria, nor were they present in Iraq, but they were quick to step in and start taking resources when the time came.  I would personally like nothing more then if the U.S. stayed out of world affairs and to be honest, it's a shared opinion among most individuals here that I converse with.  We don't want to involve ourselves with other countries problems as we have our own.  The only issue is it falls back on our politics which is shit.  There is money to be made and the assholes running the country also control the companies that provide services during these situations and make a hefty profit, again off regular citizens like you and I.
With regards to "rocket man", I am assuming you mean Kim Jung Un.  Let me just say, it is widely known that we don't wipe the floor with that dipshit only because of China.  they are essentially backing him, but not because they like his ass, but because N. Korea is on the backdoor of China and if they cooperated with the U.S., it would put China's enemy (U.S.) right outside their borders, something they can't allow.
Notice noone is talking about those islands China stole from Japan a couple years ago that now have a military base with air strip on them.  that news was squashed and the media attentions immediately fell into the shitstorm that was our presidential election.

Yeah, I know that, as does anyone else. Good luck on getting them to ban the dollar.

Stay away from Reddit. Your report will only me three words long. “To the moon.”

are you actually purchasing btc from LBC?  why with so many other options available?  Most prices on there are already inflated, not to mention LBC takes their cut as well. It's like being double taxed.

If you can watch the other alt coins you can flip your losses and return with a bigger piece of the bitcoin pie. Certain coins vary 2-9% daily. 
For example, I just bought 1 btc worth of ripple in anticipation of Swell. 10k XRP even doubling over the next few weeks will net me a whole additional BTC depending on its price at the time.

Yea, when I clicked it I heard the flatline sound from a heart monitor..

Just read Coinbase prompt. It’s for KYC/AML purposes.

Its the point of spreading the word.  I already sent in a request that amazon accept bitcoin as a payment.  All you can do is ask, it only helps.   Spread the word.  
the real deal killer today (not with Amazon however) is the tx speeds and fees at times.  Its more expensive and time consuming then a simple swipe of the card.

True, you can lead a horse to water... however instead of people replying to the posts and explaining to these people over and over again, you can get a simple response that sends them to a link about their respective topic. Wallets and their use is a big one, transferring off exchanges being another. I’d be the first to say “check the submenu” and link to their topic and after time it would eliminate a lot of the clutter.
If the problem about creating such a style sheet and the technical know how, perhaps investing some of that donated BTC for an artist/designer within the community to overhaul the sub would be a good investment. A slasher sub with more direct links to commonly asked questions would be a great investment in the end and has the potential to draw in more subscribers. Shit at close to reaching another ATH, even .1-.25 btc would probably cover the cost.

When people talk about the future of money, I like to think about Star Trek. Look at all the tech that series was perceiving back then that has come and is now apart of everyday life. Any future movies show people paying in “credits”.

Sorry man, according g to our government, you are a criminal and now you e made your mom an accomplice to a crime.... J/K and congrats!!!

Then it’s a matter of port forwarding to ensure bitcoin traffic still flows.  Of the government is banning bitcoin traffic on an ISP level, they would have already taken action on a financial level.. ie forbidding coin to fiat transactions.

Yea but that’s the classy side of the long arm of the law. Most people in prison say the cops came and got them, very few claim to reach Interpol levels.
