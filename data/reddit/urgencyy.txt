You're absolutely right. But on the other hand, it is showing the characteristics of a bubble in it's truest form, and could deflate any day. Tough call.

You are a sad, small little man. I mean fairly new as I started reading up about it when it hit $50.

bad timing

Working on informing myself much more, thank you.

Not sure I agree with the chances of success being close to 100%, but I understand what you're saying. thanks.

don't bother mining

I know it is, unfortunately it's all I can afford right now. Trust me if I could have afford more, I would certainly buy more. Hopefully someday soon. Have a good one.

I was on vacation last week and stayed at a hotel with a casino in the lobby. Every night I would go play craps and every night I would return to my room a little poorer. Until the last night. I played for 30 minutes and got lucky and walked out with $600 of profit for the whole week. I almost didn't play in fear of losing more. 
This story is irrelevant.

Exactly! Wish I had some more (potentially) disposable cash flow, but i've got some other priorities in my life. C'est la vie.

are you retarded? i'd do it for 10 bitcoins.

I will likely wait it out this week and maybe wait for the correction. How quickly did previous corrections come after a large spike like this?

This is exactly the kind of advice I was looking for. thank you very much, I'm lucky enough to have a little bit of money to play with currently and will definitely look into this.

especially when you publicly post on the internet that you are investing 50k (no offense OP)
