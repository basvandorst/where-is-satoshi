How fast did your transaction get through?

Can't have him as a core dev. Nobody should trust someone who is dumb enough to believe that shit.

It wasn't "coinbase" that stole your money. Who owns Coinbase? "Coinbase" is just a label that represents a small group of people making the decision to steal your money. These people are easily identified, they go by other labels like CEO, COO, CFO, VC investor. If any group of people stole my money, I would go get it back directly from the persons who made the decision to steal it.

STFU and get out of here with your establishment ball sack licking.

Brave browser is the killer app...it's the best onramp to Bitcoin I've ever seen. This is how Bitcoin goes mainstream!
Edit: I can't believe people don't see this. Letting people acquire Bitcoin without having to register and purchase through an exchange is by far the best way to spread Bitcoin use/users.

I'm not understanding the objection to block time change. A marginal amount of bloat could be the only concern that I see with 2min blocks. Orphan would increase but the reward would /5 so the orphan cost would not increase.
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:46:17
Of course the reward/5.
The issue is not total bandwidth. The issue is with latency of large blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:19:26
But the block reward would be cut as well (in this case /2). The orphans would increase but the orphan cost would be about the same.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:28:11
The argument against increasing the block size is due to propagation time of large blocks. This approach increases the transaction throughput while maintaining the block size (propagation time). 
The lower wait time is simply a side benefit and applies to only zeroconf transactions in a RBF environment. 
Security is not reduced for the same amount of time (not the same amount of blocks).
Another benefit of this approach is to somewhat decentralize mining away from pools. Currently there is an amount of hash power where a miner hits enough blocks that it makes economic sense to not use a pool and to not pay pool fees. With more blocks (and a reduced block reward) there would be economic incentive for a miner 5x smaller than the current level to not use pools.

The halving is known. The effect the halving will have on the price is not known and therefore not priced in.

Didn't Fyrstikken run an altcoin exchange that scammed people out of coins?
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:50:01
After all the conspiracy theories...Latency issues with large blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:52:45
Change to 5 min blocks. As hash power (security) increases, change to 2.5 min blocks. Adjust reward to stay in line with current distribution schedule...all fixed!
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:33:40
Companies like Coinbase and VC's have more control over BTC than you are aware.

...and the lazy, self indulgent youth in the western countries. These entitled kids don't know what hard work means.
@_date: 2016-03-15 08:03:17
Not a constitunal democracy with the rule of law intact. Meaning not the USA.
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:20:05
@_date: 2016-03-09 22:51:41
You should have started learning how to work hard at 12-13yrs old, long before you thought about college. This is why I say the youth in western countries have no idea what hard work is.
Life is about choices, you chose to go to college and now you blame others for that decision. I bet you are "feeling the Burn"...pathetic. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:53:17
Uhhh, your "Bitcoin" won't have miners, payment processors, exchanges or users...enjoy.

No, im not. Poor guess...Its clear have the mentality of a pre-30's lazy son of a bitch.

It's not a currency...its a settlement layer. Regulators are always behind the times.

Couldn't bitcoin do without the dramatic tone. I've seen this display from both sides of this disagreement. This is an intellectual discussion...keep it that way.

@_date: 2016-03-06 07:33:34
The transaction throughput will be increased. That is the goal ATM.

If you are not correct...we are all screwed.

The Dunning-Kruger effect in action...sad to observe.
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:26:22
We currently have too much security based on the size of the ecosystem. Change now to 5 min blocks. As hash power (security) increases, change to 2.5 min blocks. Adjust reward to stay in line with current distribution schedule.
Orphans would not increase significantly on a percentage basis. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:14:33
All would be mine!
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:19:29
There would not be a higher percentage of orphans to total blocks, the net effect on miners would be zero. It will **slightly** increase chain size but as you said, the issue cited by small block proponents is bandwidth not storage. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:40:36
I'd pay a premium for BTC from 2009. How do I buy?
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:54:17
Grasping much?

No...I do not need to read more. Nice try at passing it off.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:12:13
Can I use it as trust or scheduled payment savings account? Like split up my stash and lock some btc for 10yrs, some for 15yrs, some for 20yrs? So I don't get itchy fingers and sell too soon....

I lost $12.3456 billion on Gox, so I have no clue as to how others could have lost that much.

Any plans for 5x margin trading? You have a nice site and I (and probably many others) will make the jump if you have some leverage.

This IS the huge impact of these devices. I have been saying this over and over...it's like people don't 'get it'. Once these are prevalent, the huge profit mines are done.

This is the point where Bitcoin in centralized wallet services will be confiscated by governments. HOLD YOUR OWN BITCOINS.

@_date: 2016-05-10 17:42:36
Easiest way to protect against this possibility is to make it economics not work in the attackers benefit. If it costs 10000btc to bruteforce an address, keep less than 10000btc in any address. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:58:10
Game Theroy would disagree. Since security consumes resources, each actor would be incentivized to add as little security as possible and rely on other members of the chain to provide the security. The result of this would be an insecure system that no one would use. With Bitcoin, or more spacificaly mining, adding security is incentivized.
