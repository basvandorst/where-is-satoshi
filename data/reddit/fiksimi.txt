telling people about bitcoin is pretty much the same as giving it to them - every time i've told someone about it, BTC has risen considerably in the next few weeks after.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:30:38
hopefully  hackers will think he's not worth the hack.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:38:54
 I dunno if they have - but if they didn't, every time I walked past them, I was a a reminder that they should have. Some friends, some colleagues.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:21:34
it's because it's volatile that you actually follow it man..
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:37:08
excellent - i'll check them out. thank you
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:11:35
I almost closed it..and then I noticed it. The nipple was distracting me.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:16:07
haven't heard about these new chips  - but i don't think there is a way out of bitcoin for China or anyone. They're gonna ban it in their country - dump it all and get the price down to hundreds - and it'll just climb back up again.  
They wouldn't want to exclude themselves out of it in the longterm.
I could be totally wrong of course.

celebrities noticing woulda been huge when btc was (cheaper) affordable to the majority. Anyone that looks at the price now is probably gonna think they missed the boat and won't necessarily reach for their pockets. That's my take on it anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:05:34
major limits and ridiculous premiums  - it looks good though.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:39:16
Hmmm yes - I see it. And what's more, "look at the bitcoin thing  - it's down 8%..let's get some!"
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:17:29
Yes - mass adoption of 300 dollars worth of BTC in every hospital.
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:04:38
is this what they call a whale in the cryptoworld?
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:33:02
watch the news
@_date: 2017-05-04 06:50:18
question is how do you tell them without them thinking its a scam/pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:06:46
lol at these responses  and welcome to the crypto world..trust me there are communities that are way worse/harsh out there. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:06:33
I registered with them yesterday..uploaded some ID..waiting for a response - I guess i should pull out. Thanks for the warning man.
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:30:34
it's not fun just making money at some point i guess 
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:29:34
isn't the guy asking for 300 dollars per hack...people gotta step up security - info/backups need to be offline, inaccessible and regularly updated.
It's a shame that Bitcoin could be tainted because of a lack of security elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:02:17
fair enough - if anything....maybe all hospitals will now buy 300 dollars worth of btc lol - that can only increase the price
@_date: 2017-05-04 06:46:26


How much do you get charged per deposit?
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:43:18
I expected more of a dip...this is kinda tame.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:03:21
working hard and then buying hard
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:14:34
that's a difficult question - but it's food for thought.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:38:00
what really hurts is the "Baloneyax" server issues/supposed attacks. If the coin dropped naturally - I'd accept it better because I know I'm solely to blame for my losses.
It was a mess when trying to sell/buy/use stop-order...totally unacceptable considering what was at stake.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:31:59
that's pretty terrible. Being told to go home when you actually need to be in a hospital...this guy is heartless. If he is really just one guy. Let's see what consequences follow. Maybe that'll give us a clue.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:59:18
yes me - more than 20% sadly...im holding these bastard alts (mainly STR) until they go back to my original purchase - or im going down to 0.0 BTC with them.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:45:19
Can i register with wells fargo from KSA though - or is it US customers only? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:52:25
what's the cause?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:20:18
 I  thought the same thing but..if the news just says BITCOIN + ATTACK + CRIMINAL then i dunno...it would be hard to change the opinion of the mainstream
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:03:02
informative until you go to the guessing game
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:51:04
So what just happened... LTC BTC ETC and ETH suddenly decreased in value
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:11:51
if you lose your phone - but get another phone and sign in with the same google mail as before (android) - will you get access to all 2fa passwords? This works on many apps through synching.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:50:11
thing is - these wallets are empty...so there shouldn't be any transactions anyway
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:50:48
answer to both of your comments is easy: fear/insecurity. Hodlers fear a price drop that could come with the split. The reaction towards the product of this split is therefore negative, of course. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:08:14
cool story about the tulips and all. This is 2017 though. BTC has been through that and more.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:35:55
 a lady came and spoke to him live at the back - he probably knew what he was doing and was ready to be fired..if it happened at all
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:14:29
wow - would it be wise to go to LTC instead of USD I wonder. I'm excited about it going lower actually......bad press isn't always bad. It could shoot up after a while. Or it could taint BTC for good.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:44:20
many thanks for this  advice.
@_date: 2017-05-04 06:45:02
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:47:03
 I see. I just wanted to see if my old private keys were safe to use again by making sure no one opened them for viewing. I guess I can't do that. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:29:55
in turbulent times - the grips are not the same

civilization isn't moving forward then - people don't know what forks are again.

it's too late for real news!

Don't use Paypal for bitcoin. This piece of advice is all over the internet. 
Also, don't spend/invest money that you could potentially need (like for emergencies).
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:20:50
and now it's just about crypto.
