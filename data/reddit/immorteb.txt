Would be impossible i assume due to how many people use paper wallets and so on. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:16:35
thank you for a great service
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:06:28
I'm sure THEY can get it out easier than anyone lol
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:34:36
I'd buy it
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:24:29
That much huh? Lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:17:28
They deliver worldwide and didnt realize they didnt have laptops my apologies.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:21:50
The only other place i know of is [The Bitcoin Store]( 
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:07:04

Nothing will ever replace gold but my third choice after silver would be BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:48:33
One of my fav sites. Thay are open to buyers though,maybe someone will come along and buy it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:54:12
Check out BitRoad they have some cool stuff
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:07:22
which real estate is this? this is great
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:26:47
You would be better off mining for Litecoins and then exchanging them for BTC imo
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:20:52
Awesome, but wtf is that?
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:52:50
BitMit was so great if you can mimic that, you would get my business fast.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:06:35
The more people complain about how the government should see Bitcoin, expect them to eventually crack down hard on them and start taxing transactions, making sure companies that run wallet services start operating like banks and so on. Personally idc how the government sees bitcoins, i just want it to remain as is.

Never trust google for anything sensitive. Make your own cloud service with OwnCloud with SSL and over seas and you will be ok.

Sure, on Bitmit, when you purchase something from someone, you have the ability to read seller feedback first and read buyer experiences. Upon agreeing to purchase something from someone, you obviously click order, send the bitcoins to a generated BTC address that will be stored in BitMits system, the bitcoins will only be released if you click release when you receive your product in the mail. If you do not get back to them or take too long clicking release payment, the seller has the ability to click "request release", bitmit will then let you know the bitcoins will be released in 5 days, notified in a email sent to both the seller and buyer. This works great in case you purchase something and the seller is a fraud, each time you make a purchase, a random btc address is generated to hold your btc in the system while you wait for your package. It is hard to go into full detail since I'm on a tablet but that is pretty much the rundown.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:43:44
it is not a watch only account, when i click receive money it doesnt say anything but the address and an actions dropdown.
@_date: 2013-06-01 22:51:35
I think ppl should share more because we need to keep bitcoins going. I just use the free sites until i get a bitcoin. Theres a redditor giving away a few terracoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:27:22
Will check it out ty for the suggestion.
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:06:26
yeah i never made any outgoing transactions because i have just been trying to rack up on btc from free sites, and when i decided to use them i couldnt.
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:31:54
Fair enough but I see it as Gold and Silver is universal and Bitcoin still isn't so at least having some Gold and Silver would be smart.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:58:46
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:23:15
Anyone made cointwerk yet? Lol
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:00:19
sure thank you, sent
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:25:09
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:16:16
I really like their service also, but i didnt know there was a help desk, i couldnt find it, and i tried contacting them on twitter many times, but they are helping me now and hopefully i can use my btc. I used to use another wallet and it was horrible until my friends told me to use BlockChain, hope it gets sorted out, and i will try your suggestion if all else fails.
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:08:28
(Although i don't have a link on the tablet I'm using now) this kind of site exists, but you 1 up'd them by making it open source. Good job
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:02:19
Why not mix both ideas, BitMit's genius payment system, with your forum idea, categories and organized product lists with threads attached to the product with user/seller breakdown, reviews like yelp etc. Sounds good to me
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:26:48
I did not know about  I now have a new place to shop lol thanks
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:00:02
Why do we want it mainstream? Wouldn't that makes govs start trying harder to control it and or make it illegal?
@_date: 2013-11-02 11:49:57
What are those for? Ive never seen those
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:44:07
I think it will drop one more time and maybe a couple before even reaching beyond this. Just my opinion
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:47:36
Congrats! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:36:54
Same here, i had 720 points recently and only $3 worth of btc in one of my wallets so i got a $15 amazon gift card and felt like i won the lotto lol
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:46:20
Business, it is a good domain name why sell? Think, one time sell or constant btc flow.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:36:05
Gyft is great, they accept Bitcoins and you now get points for using bitcoins that can give you a discount towards your next purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:48:36
Well put
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:57:43
 one of my favorite sites
