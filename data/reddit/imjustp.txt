I think they will attempt to capitalise as much as possible, however true blockchains should be infallible to certain abuses and Facebook's shady ball fondling tactics will push people to the true blockchain, Bitcoin..... or so I hope.   
Either way I think this will expose just how fucked up of a company Facebook is and just how much power these types of companies truly posses.

Of course, there will always be people covering every square inch of the fence for all debates.

I think you’re confusing autonomously with voluntarily. Voluntary implies that you have done something entirely of your own free will, which you haven’t. If you do not pay tax you go to prison. That is not voluntary. Further to that, if you pay the incorrect amount you get a fine. I don’t see how you believe that to be voluntary.

Oh I agree that’s why the warning is in the first paragraph. I try my utmost to list when wallets etc are custodial n whatnot. Sometimes I fail through my own lack of information but it has been a sticking point in recent times and the main focus of the site is to provide as unbiased as possible articles which are non sponsored thus able to be honest.
Edit: just wanted to say the point I was making regarding onboarding was that the best way to get new blood is to allow people to easily get involved n experience it’s utility. That’s the main reason I decided to post about sat2. The airdrop craze which passed last year proved how much more than a phone number people are willing to give out freely.

Would you like to see all the edits? The content of the article was never changed, mate.

What exactly am I shilling? A website with no advertising and no sponsored content? The sole reason I have no BTC address is simply that I cannot have a named one as with the ones which are there. If I could add that i would. It simply looks messy with a traditional crypto address.   
The profile only has ETH as I was claiming a bounty which required it in the past, hence it no longer being displayed on the post pages.   
You can dislike my writing, you can dislike me, you can dislike my site. That is all good. But do not put words and sentiment into my mouth. I am not shilling anything and over 50% of my crypto holdings are in BTC, not that I have to justify anything to you.   
I also do not have, LTC, BCH, NEO and a load more of possible donations avenues. It is not through disliking the coins at all simply appearance.  
What you call constructive criticism is anything but. Please do continue to attempt to discredit my ethics and insult me though. It says more about you than me.   
Peace, love and happiness.

“I would like to just finish on this by stating that the Spedn app by Flexa may well be a great app and a solid step forward for crypto in general. There is just a lot of misinformation being posted (not to the fault of Flexa) regarding it and I do not want people to be wrongly informed.”
Should have read the full article.

Yeah, that is fair. I just thought it was a cool service and that it does represent a big step forward with regards to easily on-boarding new users.

Of the article? There is only one version. The edits were to resolve an issue with the image being linked due to the filename ending with a ' . ' so it was &lt;filename.&gt;.jpg which was causing issues with linking systems.
