Le *gasp*.

I wish the US would hurry up and just fully jump on the bandwagon instead of skidding on their heels behind it. ¬_¬

I feel like the financial institute in question either trying to get in on that Bitcoin gain by exploiting inexperienced Bitcoin owners or are unaware that they're... *Kinda*... **The problem**...
And in the latter case, someone should probably tell them.

How would you know I was telling the truth? Isn't that kind of the point of the illuminati? ¯\_( °—°)_/¯

I literally just said that exact phrase to my wife.

I still don't think that the reason is political. It probably had something to do with a visitor to your site collecting your address and sending a complaint of some kind (or multiple) to Coinbase and they traced it back to your account, thus suspending it. They did say they moved it to cold storage so it's still there and untouched.

I don't think that banks are the on-ramps we need. Look at Greece. Sure, their banks are joining the moon-bound bandwagon, but for a while, there wasn't a need for bank interference. Bitcoin ATMs popped up everywhere and a lot of places started accepting Bitcoin for payments. There's a Gas Station in Greeley, CO that has a Bitcoin terminal that you can pay for your stuff with Bitcoin. Dell, Amazon, Lamborghini, Newegg are just a few companies in the US that accept Bitcoin as payment and i promise you that it's not going to a bank. Banks aren't necessary and are almost counter-intuitive; education and accessibility is that final on-ramp we need.

Show them youtube videos about it. Educate them. Show them the wiki page that says that Bitcoin is a legal, federally accepted currency. Show them the Coinbase FAQ. Tell them to contact Coinbase if they're still concerned. It really comes down to education. PM me if you need more help. I recently educated my parents on the matter and they're pretty old fashioned.

I don't really have any specific recommendations, but any cold storage wallet is better than none. Just google "BTC Hardware Wallets"

Don't exploit noobs, man. That's not cool.

I'm surprised after seeing this that my Google search for "Illuminaticoin altcoin" didn't yield more interesting results. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:25:26
Wat... No! HODL! HHOODDLL! 
That's been my philosophy. Served me well so far lol

Foreword: I read your response email comment.
Why do you think it's politically related? 
I'm not savvy on Coinbase policy, but do they track if you're sending Bitcoin to addresses associated with illegal activity? If so, that could be a reason for your ban. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:50:11
Yes, but I'm not going overload this person whose just getting into the open-source, anonymous world by having them change everything all at once. 
OP, duckduckgo.com is definitely an admirable search engine if you want unbiased, non-personalized search results.

I'm not saying there shouldn't be a bridge between banking and Bitcoin. I would personally love having my Bitcoin reside alongside my American dollars in my bank, but banks, especially the larger ones, have a really bad reputation for controlling the flow of money to a disgusting degree. I don't feel like I can trust them with this kind of power over Bitcoin. I would hate to see them swoop in, take control, and do something we all regret. I guess we can agree to disagree, though. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:56:20
Hmm. Well, in this scenario, based on what's been shared, I'd say you may want to hire a lawyer and demand your assets be moved to addresses in your possession because it's a federal currency and they don't have the right to just take your money without giving you a sound, legal reason. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:27:14
*possibly*? What I meant was the original idea of bitcoin was to keep it decentralized. Banks are literally the opposite of that ideal and starts us on a really dangerous path of a monitored, centralized Bitcoin.

Broken link, sir and/or madam. :(

That concept already exists in the current denominational model, though. 10,000 bits for $22 and some change. That's not a bad selling point when you point out that 1 BTC is worth $2200+. This whole thing is just one bit face-palm. 
I'm seriously thinking about contacting bitcoin.it and giving them some helpful, "don't over-complicate a simple concept" advice. Make comparisons, not new denominations; a mBTC is like the penny of the Bitcoin world. Take that penny and make it really expensive. Then get 1000 of those expensive pennies and you have 1 Bitcoin. Don't forget that they don't tangibly exist. And Congratulations! You've passed Bitcoin Basics Academy.

Okay, good, because I was starting to wonder if I'd been wrong all this time since more and more sites are designating Bitcoin denominations as such and I'd just missed something. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:23:11
That doesn't really make sense, though, because the Wiki shows every possible denomination including upwards of "Decabitcoins". It's a freakin' mess and overly complicated. I don't think that's good marketing.
