let me explain how money works:
Unlike sausages, which get eaten and thereby destroyed, money (and BTC) could be sold more than once.
So if you buy 2 BTC to do some DNM shopping, and return to Localbitcoins to buy moar when you need to reup, odds are you'll be buying the same BTC that you paid with on DNM, because that's where HMisterCut sells his BTC for USD. this can happen ad infinitum, with the same 2 B getting sold again and again.

How does your coffee shop with iPad for a register compare to OP's bodega doing 2+ customers/min 24/7? Are you suggesting OP's friend, who runs the bodega, should trash his legacy register &amp; upgrade to POSTablet? Have you seen anything *but* overpriced boutiques/cafes use POSTablets?
And this guy, who is trying to save money, is supposed to start accepting BTC not due to "ideological terms that supercede convenience" (like you &amp; your barista buddy), but because one out of a thousand people would use BTC?! 
I'm not even being hyperbolical here. At 100k customers (transactions) a month (which is what OP claims the bodega does), that would add up to 100 Bitcoin sales, which is ...yeah.

So you bought a coffee and waited for five minutes for tx to confirm? On more than one occasion? This sounds weird, because I tend to walk out of the store (streetcorner bodega type of a deal, like OP's talking about, the one that handles more than 2 transactions per minute if open 24/7). But k, there can be cultural differences, you might hang about to see when your tx confirms.
According to  "For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 13,560 satoshis (0.07$)." Was $0.11 a few days ago, the last time I checked. 
So on top of what otherwise would be a quick &amp; painless cash tx, OP's friend has to step away from the cash register, whip out his phone or iPad, and deal with the 1 out of 1,000 people who walk into the store &amp; pay with BTC. Oh, and something will inevitably go wrong, and expect a 10-minute chat about the advantages of using Bitcoin from everyone who pays with BTC. As the grumbling line grows.

Assuming that the goal of an exchange is "surviving as long as possible," you are correct. If, OTOH, the goal is to make as much money in as short a span of time as possible (e.g. making off with ~72 mil USD of coin) without landing in jail, your argument falls apart.


Assuming that there was an actual hack, I find the fact that BFX is still operating, with its victims trading their debt tokens (now with leverage, lol) absolutely miraculous. I mean they literally replaced people's actual money with debt tokens.

No. If there's no uptrend, so no " indications that this is starting to occur"; nothing is happening. So the answer to your question, "Has the halving price pressure begun yet?" might be a bit of a disappointment. So take a seat, if you're not sitting down already.
Now then, the price is not going to go up, because after getting pumped on the perfect storm of halvening hype and Brexit, that's pretty damn near impossible. There.
How's that?
Edit: There is no "pressure." Bitcoin supply did not decrease, it's growing all the time, at a rate of 12.5 BTC every 9 minutes and a few seconds. Miners still need to sell their coins. If everyone just hodls, 1800 coins still need to be sold every day.

That's what traders are looking for from exchanges, yes. 
This is not new. When Christ cleansed the Temple, it's the money changers he drove out, the ones making money by buying one coin with another. Currency traders. He said they were turning it into "a den of thieves." 
Where were we? Oh yeah, now imagine this Temple, and there's shitloads of people selling stuff -- an indoor-outdoor market, sort of, and to swap one kind of money for another, you walked around, chatting up one money changer after another, haggling, and finally getting something done.
Today people are expecting more from their money than they did 2,000 years ago.
But Bitsquare is not more, it's less. It's not faster. It's a bazaar, with (up to) a bunch of people peddling coin. Only when, 2,000 years ago, you walked away from the Temple, you were carrying some coin and maybe a couple of doves. 
Bitsquare? Well, there's no one there to haggle with. (up to) 4 guy[s] selling, (up to) 2 guy[s] "arbitrating."
This is not an exchange. It's actually a step *down* from that 2,000-year-old Temple, with [arguably] substantially higher odds of getting had. This is not revolutionary, or even evolutionary, this is *de*volutionary.

The whole concept of "Trading those IOUs across continents" is insane. WTF are you thinking? These IOUs aren't even legal in US, a US person can't buy them (BFX terms).


If I want the counterparty to *honor* those tokens, e.g. pay me a dollar each for them (which, of course, the counterparty didn't promise to do), I'll need the same lawyers etc., etc. 
What the blockchain is instrumental in, in this instance, is allowing you to sell your worthless, undefined and certainly unbacked, debt tokens to greater fools more efficiently, anywhere in the world. Actually getting value from these tokens will require lawyers (or yet another layer of greater fools).

So bigger market cap than all but the top 13 cryptos. 
And remember, market cap is irrelevant, as long as the asset is hot. One BFX debt token could be traded millions of times a day, bringing in the same fees as one million tokens changing hands once.
And there are ~70 million of those tokens :)

People are not necessarily looking to maximize choice and freedom from short-term rental moderators. Just like, when renting a hotel room, I don't want to choose who handles the hotel's laundry contract, maid service, or security. I just want to know those things will be done &amp; what my room costs.


Censorship? And when I'm in East Dumbfuck Nowhere, I can't even call the cops, because the rental agreement itself is illegal?

You said BTC price is up 260%, so "preformed better than BTC by ~340%," how did you think? If you're implying that it's not about market price, then don't bring up market price.


Like any penny stock on a largely unregulated market, Bitcoin is rife with subterfuge and manipulation. Now, taking into account the sophistication and ideological loading of an average Bitcoin investor...
Take yourself, for example. You're what's colloquially called *married to* Bitcoin. Selling, for you, would mean more than accepting you've made a lousy call. Your ego, self-worth, world view -- all hitched to the same hitchin' post -- Bitcoin!

Already sorta replied to this elsewhere, but TL;DR:
1. Finding a watermark and removing it are two separate problems. Watermarks are a bitch to remove, especially if they don't need to be recognizable by humans.
2. Finding one watermark doesn't mean you've found them all -- there are multiple watermarks embedded, the app updates itself through the intertubes, so after [what the reviewer Bob  assumed] was a cleaned copy, appy downloads a new set of instructions &amp; starts looking fr a different pattern. Different, but, nevertheless, unique to reviewer Bob. Someone's a few bux richer, Bob's owned.

What could be "reverse-engineered"? Look, I'm not a cryptologist and know next to nothing about it, but trivial schemes, like putting a watermark in every frame, in random screen coordinates, would make it pretty difficult to remove. There's literlly nothing to reverse-engineer -- the location is random, the watermark could be a mesh of points.
Yes, watermarks are extremely effective, and pattern recognition makes them more so -- try Google image search, strip the metadata off a .jpg, convert it to a .gif, resize &amp; crop it. Done? Good. Now upload it to imgur or some such, and try google image search again. Magic!
And this is a static image, not 24fps x 60sec x 120mins.
Finally, preventive measures are a misnomer -- they don't prevent anything, they merely reduce the incidence of bad shit happening by making crime *more difficult* or more time-consuming.

This is much harder than you think. Would you like to try your hand at removing watermarks? Have you tried? Or do you assume that since it's metaphysically possible, it's also practical?


Correct, how to find 7. And Ripmaster Bob, being a leet coder, has scripted himself a tool that has removed all the 7s. What What Ripmister doesn't know is what other watermarks the app will be looking for, once it updates itself, a week later, through the interweb.

I'm not making myself clear. Greasy Bob is afraid to leak the vid, because he knows there's more than one watermark in his copy. Bob has mad skillz, and has managed to remove (make the app not trigger) one watermark, but there's a nearly infinite number of possible "watermarks," and he doesn't know what to look for, not untill a week later, when the app [more likely a plugin] gets updated through the intertubes. By then the vid's in the wild, with Bob's name on it, too late for Bob.

Unlike solar power plants, those fueled by hydrocarbons (oil, coal, natural gas, wood -- fuels used by Enercity, the power company in question) can produce as much or as little power as necessary (while only Mr. Burns can shut off the sun).  
But you are correct, if you build ginormous solar fields in the middle of nowhere, forgetting that there are no transmission lines to carry the power you'll produce? Yeah, you're not gonna have a good time, gonna produce some surplus power that no one can use, while the rest of the country is in sore need of it.

Short, I'll just paste it
Prosecutors in the Netherlands are seeking prison sentences for two brothers who they say used stolen electricity to power computers they used to mine bitcoins worth an estimated 200,000 euros ($223,500).
Prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday that powerful computers used to "mine" the electronic currency were found in a building in the port city of Rotterdam that belonged to one of the brothers and also was used as a cannabis nursery.
Equipment in the nursery and the computers were running on illegally tapped electricity when they were discovered in 2014. The brothers, whose identities were not released, are charged with money laundering.
Prosecutors asked judges to impose a 15-month sentence on one brother and five months on the other.

Bitcoin integration is much simpler than that, [plenty of free APIs on the web]( Also the business model is different -- a payment processor typically takes a percentage of every transaction, but once the "plugin" is set up, why pay a monthly fee? Support?


In the same sense as the guy who sells you a cash register is a payment processor, i guess. It's a somewhat nonstandard definition, but this is all terra incognita :|


It is not in BitPay's rational self-interest to tell its clients "Look, just keep the BTC that you get as BTC, and then you can do it with a simple, free chunk of code. You don't need us anymore."

There's nothing unusual about buying at an all-time high, happens as often than buying at an all-time low.
I'd say you need to bone up on statistics and probabilities before venturing into markets. let me give you a had... Let me give you a ...helping hand... 
All things being equal, a market is as likely to keep rising, at any point in time, as it is to start falling. If (an ideal) coin has landed "heads" 10 times in a row, this doesn't mean that the smart thing to do is bet on "tails." The odds of it coming up heads are still 50/50.

How do you read the numeral 7, without first knowing its exact position on the screen? How does an OCR app read text in random points on the screen? Elfin magic!


No. You're distributing a tool that tells you that there is a "watermark," not where it is, or even what it is. Further, there could be multiple"watermarks" embedded in the frames, and the tool has access to the internet. Can download new keys -- new rotor settings for Enigma, so even tho Greasy Bob removed the "watermarks" the app was looking for when he leaked the copy, Appy, with new keys, finds the other watermarks, which it wasn't looking for when Bob leaked == Bob's owned. A deterrent :|


Because the "watermark" doesn't have to be the same size, color, rotation, etc -- only needs to be a recognizable pattern. Just like you, if told to look for the numeral 7, can find it in every font, every color, every which way it's bent, pincushioned or warped.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that you're not ready for financial freedom, 'coz most grownups have those things, and jobs, and when they need to wire money they don't go to *a* bank, they go to *their* bank, because they're statist sheeple &amp; have a bank account &amp; sometimes even a job.
Protip: start a bank account, start a PP account, get a CC. That way, you won't have to do bank wires from some bank each time you need to buy a $30 computer part.

Everything to do with his hugeness, ginormity, and striking resemblance to a flightless, landbound blimp. If not for his colossal body weight, he wouldn't be the tremendous lardass that he is, and we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Got no idea why you're insane, genetics and/or organic solvent abuse, if I had to guess. I'm telling you the reason you think everything is "blockchain = monowheel" is this: you are batshit crazy.
I don't expect you to understand this either. You probably think I typed "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel" "blockchain = monowheel"

I'm sure there are meth whores who are decent human beings with hearts of gold. Unfortunately, few know them as meth whores, because those meth whores are smart enough to keep a low profile. And that's why, Riiume, meth whores have such a bad rap -- the meth whores who show up on people's radar as meth whores tend to be scumbags. There's a lesson in there somewhere.

OP, just buy a bunch of high-ticket items with your CC, and sell them for 40c on the dollar in an alley, behind the dumpster, for cash. Like maybe a bunch of watches you could hang on the lining of your trench coat. 
Approach posh looking human females, preferably at night (that's when they really crave watches) on deserted streets (to be safe from The Man). Walk a few paces behind her, saying "Pstt... PSstt! PSSSSTT!!" (if her steps quicken, keep up! She wants to transact, but *you must be persistent*). When she finally turns around, put your right arm around her, lean in super close &amp; educate her about international finance and why she must help you escape criminal banksters who wanna watch you buy ...things.
If you need any other money-delaundering tricks, you let me know,.

You know that fiat money is *meant* to depreciate, right? So you'd use it instead of stuffing it in your mattress?
The trick is to make it depreciate at a steady, constant rate, instead of bounce around every day, so people will have a rough idea of what shit will cost tomorrow.
Otherwise, even the merchants who accept that fiat would have to price their goods in something more stable. Does this help?

There are  2^160 possible addresses. So if the odds are 1/(2^160) for one address, they're 2/(2^160) for 2, n/(2^160) for n. If you create 2^160 addresses, the odds are 100%. Go nuts :)

This time it's Kim Dotcom trying to screw over artists *and* middlemen, that's what this thread is about.


Yeah, how'd that go? Did she finally figure out that people don't want to learn all about Etherium, smart contracts, or go through a simple 20-step process to download a tune? Could that have played a part in her not selling dick through Ujo?

You're not borrowing money from your bank; your credit score is irrelevant.


You don't leave 75% of your paycheck in the bank, do you? No, you probably buy BTC with it, so why should your bank care about how frugally you live? High maintenance, to your bank, is how how many dicey people you deal with &amp; [how much support time you'll take up &amp; how much of a headache you'll turn out to be]( 


Your employer is not your bank, unless you work for a bank. You could be the best meth cook in the world, why would your bank care? 


Lol, sure [you do](

Absolutely no need for blockchain, if you want to go that way. 
There's bandcamp, soundcloud, many others, or you can [work directly with iTunes]( (which, contrary to the misleading apple logo, is not the Apple Records label). 
Perhaps you don't fully understand what a record label does, or why artists try to get signed?

Unless I can buy BTC with USD on zebpay, it is impossible for me to do it with zebpay. Because I don't have ₹, and zebpay doesn't accept USD, unlike the other listed options. Though the title of this thread implies I could send $500 US cheaper with zebpay, I can't do it, period. At any price.
