if your coins are in a wallet, they are going to stay where they are. they won't get "split". they kinda get "doubled".
imagine bitcoin-chain as a ledger. a the point of fork one ledger becomes two with their own separate post-fork future. however their pre-fork past is going to be the same. if you have 1 btc pre-fork (now), then post-fork (if that occurs) you'll have 1 btc and 1 btu (let's assume this is what they are going to be named). whether you keep both amounts on both ledgers - it's your choice. however, we cannot be sure both will be valued at around 1k usd - in the past markets didn't like hard forks - hence the current turmoil.

I hope the real Satoshi will stand up and lead the way :)
Until then we have to deal with reality where politics, corruption, lies, stupidity and money collectively and unknowingly determine the future. A hundred top minds in crypto, a hundred top minds in money, a hundred top minds in mining and a hundred top minds in lies along with other top and bottom minds in all kinds of skills - all mingle with each other in one soup of bitcoin evolution. And the evolution doesn't care who is telling the truth, it doesn't care whether it's love or rape - it will produce an offspring anyway. If there are a hundred top minds, now it's the time to come forward and fight. if they stick their heads into crypto-code-sand, the ass is still out there and it's going to be taken advantage of. lawyers, agents, hackers, shorters, lobbyists, media, whales and con-artists - all of them will have a go. 
you cannot sit at a 20-15bn table for free. bitcoin is not for kids anymore. the way down - below 1k mark - will feel comfortable and easy. the way up is hell.
