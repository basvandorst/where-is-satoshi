Buy now and wait 15 years

Depends how soon you need your savings. If you mean long term savings, then if you sell now from the panic of a dip you're most likely to just buy in again when it rallies, in which case you're likely making a loss (ie the price for short term peace of mind).

 BCH - Straight, bank-hating coin.
 BTC+LN - Identity crisis / bank-curious coin.
 XRP - Out and proud banker coin.

Maybe it's just German--"[BTC is] *The* Bitcoin, *The*!"

Some exchanges are insured with major insurance companies for events like hacking. Find out which and don't get Goxed.

Guess that won't be possible until this "price discovery" era runs its full course.

You haven't made fiat until you sold.

The crypto offered on *GDAX* is struggling.
Jack the Ripple has had another killer of a day.

Your decision, but I think it's safe to assume that ETH will continue to rise steadily mid to long term, so I wouldn't make a loss now just because BTC is up right now and ETH is down/flat. Diversifying seems prudent so good for you.

Correction (pun intended): looks like Ripple ended up having a bad hair day as well. So you were on the money with "Crypto as a whole is struggling" (in terms of price movements, at least).

Upvoted for the first sentence. But I respect your points in the second as well.

I know that there is pain, but you hodl on for one more day.

I like the literary vibe it provides. "The whale is proven malicious." That's top rate Melville there.

The question is, when tickets to the moon become available, which currency will they be sold in?

They can mine a shitload of gold from asteroids etc.

And lo, as Christ went down into Gehenna on Passover and rose again shortly thereafter, so did the Coin of Bits go down to the price range of 666 and will surely rise again. Yea, though we scroll through the Valley of FUD, have faith, ye of little hodlings, for verily the scriptures say that even Job was spat back up onto the shore by the very whale that had swallowed him days before.

Enjoyable, if somewhat abortive.

I'm learning how to buy.
