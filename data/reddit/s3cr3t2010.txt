I sent him around $5000 a few years ago. He said he would reimburse me at some point for helping him move back into the states. Haven't heard from him in awhile..I hope he's doing okay. I was wondering why someone with a trillion dollars would need my $5000 to help him move back into the states, but I figured he just needed some help.

Sorry for confusion. I am not mining the bitcoin directly. I am mining with NiceHash and getting paid in bitcoin and HODLing. :) ~$600 (give or take a little) a month.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:49:51
Get out of it!

Thanks, I have downloaded Electrum. I have done a 0.001 btc transaction as a test before I transfer my full amount. This allows me to backup my wallet to my pc, onedrive, dropbox, and usb. :)

Get some decent GPU cards and Hash away with Nicehash and get paid in bitcoin. message me if you want help setting up.

Bad thing is I remember mining bitcoin back then too but have no clue where I could have stored them. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:05:45
I just don't like the sound of a piece of paper holding $10,000 worth of BTC. :P I can't even keep up with my car keys.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:12:06
Don't store your seed online or on your computer anywhere. Write them down on paper and store in a safe that you possess.

I elect my County Animal Shelter who does an amazing job of finding the doggies and kitties homes!
Check them out at 
Although I don't think they support btc. Just throwing this out there if there's a chance you could donate to them and help save the animals!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:23:00
Wish you could have became best buds with a shelter dog instead. :( But either way, you saved a life by taking him home. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:51:17
Well said.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:21:25
I took a look at those, so each of those are the best recommended ones by the community as well?

That sounds like a damn awesome idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:36:29
Upvoted. Even members of r/btc is skeptical.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:24:58
What are you even rambling on about? We are talking about wallets..
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:04:28
Send me the phone, I'll repair it. :D
In all honesty, you can repair the phone. Just don't throw away the MicroSD card (if it has one) and don't change out the main motherboard of the phone. You can pretty much change everything else to revive the phone.

Thank you, I did.
I have downloaded Electrum. I have done a 0.001 btc transaction as a test before I transfer my full amount. This allows me to backup my wallet to my pc, onedrive, dropbox, and usb. :)

I just sold my latest property with a $44,790 profit. So, I'm buying some more BTC. :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:28:55
It's never too late to invest. 
You will look back in years to come and be like "Wow, I can't believe it was as cheap as $20,000".

$1000/day fine for anyone caught doing it on commercial level.. Ouch.

Hmm...Lets do it.

@_date: 2017-09-14 01:12:50
I bought $500 worth.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:57:06
Thats why you just invest $100 in it and the value of the $100 rises with the rest.
