I'd like to throw a smaller charity that is dear to my heart into the mix, [Childrens Cancer Connection]( This charity specializes in delivering services to families affected by childhood cancer in the state of Iowa. They provide counseling, resources, and various other services for families from when they get the first diagnosis, to years of support after remission.
Their flagship event is a summer camp they run twice a year. The first camp is for the children aged 5-18 who have cancer or had cancer at some point in their life. It gives kids all around Iowa a chance to have fun and get away from all the stress of treatments, doctors, overprotective parents, and other worries and be around kids who have had similar experiences. Many come from small towns and would not have met other children like them otherwise.
The second camp is for the siblings. It is very common for siblings of kids with cancer to be neglected, as parents can get very caught up in their sick child. This gives them an opportunity to be with other siblings and share their experiences, as well as have it be about them for while. 
The camps never turn anyone away, it will always find a way to accommodate any child who wants to come, even those who show up on the day camp starts. It cost $300 dollars a child to keep the camp going, and they have over 300+ kids attend camp each year. This donation would go a very long way, in fact $10,000 coincidentally coincides with a "sponsorship donation" that would allow for one cabin to be named after this cause, or I think a coin would go a great deal farther for a group like this than some of the larger orgs (although all i have seen posted so far could definitely benfit from it!), so please consider this for the giving season and we can get some kids to camp!
