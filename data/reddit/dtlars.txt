DGB will be another decentralized alternative to BTC with low price, minuscule fees, fast transaction speed, simple wallets and broadening awareness. No pump just fact.

Diversification is important with the 5 G's/1 C: Ground, grub, guns, gas, gold and cryptocurrency. Baby boomer over 65 and my friends and me value/hold all - even alts.

Wonder how much BTC this banker wants to buy and at what price? Sly dog...
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:23:22
Neither is BTC or LTC, so I'm not sure what they'd use.

So what I hear you saying is they need Digibyte DGB, the people's currency.

He's at a loss for words 'cause he didn't sell at ATH...then realizes he can buy back in now for a huge discount..."Bitcoin"

Former banker, disillusioned with fiat-based monetary system and faced with short timeline to recover from 2008 crash. Did fine in stock market runup and got into cryptocurrency 2017 based on alternative investment research. Always open for new ways to make $. Sold some B4 2018 top, hodl'd the rest (lesson learned). I believe we're at the bottom and we're prepping for new challenges. Exciting times!

Still have my 2000 Explorer w/240K miles. Sold my '95 Mazda on last dip for 0.5 BTC. Getting rid whatever else I don't need for more BTC.

Love the BTC stethoscope vs. the fiat cufflinks.

This is from personal experience. Here in Seattle we have fairly high community acceptance of new tech across age ranges as you might imagine. More study review here...cheers

Just say hold on, let me get my wallet. Open up your hard wallet with its' plausible deniability feature designed to safeguard your main funds in the event you're being forced to give up the wallet key. You've stored a few sats in it and tell him you'll hand it over if he just leaves. Throw in a few fiat for his trouble. Done

Nope, retired carpenter, plumber, mechanic, engineer and me, a former finish carpenter/reformed bankster. This motley crew likes to self-educate on new monetary systems as we're skeptical of the present fiat-based inflationary one. Alternatives are needed. X's and millennial's we find usually seem the least informed - strange.

Presumptuous much? Lots of my +65 yo boomer friends who worked with their hands and don't have degrees own cryptocurrencies. (And they store it on hard wallets with private keys). This author is on the right track to spread info for everyone. Age doesn't matter.

Yep. I predict a retrace back to 6800-7500 so solidify the base then back up over $10K. Need some serious volume to support this. I've bought into this before with low volume only to see it dip. Not FUD just gut for me and not financial advice!
