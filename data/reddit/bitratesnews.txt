Interesting thanks for taking the time.

Really? Tell me more....but...if we already have a solution why has Vitalik never heard of it?

It sounds like you are saying that solutions like shapeshift reduce the need for the blockchain to process 100's or 1000's of transactions per second but I don't really understand how.  I appreciate your help but I still just don't really get it.  Sorry just trying to wrap my head around some of the technical stuff.

I have a question.  Did you sell any Bitcoin during the peak (Dec\-Jan).  My experience is people sell when the prices are high.  hodl when they are low.  If we got to a place where the price was reliable then maybe it could be used more as a form of currency.  
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:31:50
some would call that hodl

Not sure I agree. These are sensitive times and people react accordingly. The community (although depending on which community you're referring to) will come to, stay strong!

I agree. It's more about seeking stability than the actual value of any coin for that matter.

I wonder how would they tax their employees if this goes through?

Gold has value because it's quantitatively limited and the difficulty of mining it increasingly rises. Sounds familiar?

Here is another guide if you are interested

How is trading Bitcoin different from trading in fiat currencies? The fact that it's being traded for profit doesn't mean that's Bitcoin's only use. It is a payment method more than it is a stock.

I call conspiracy. Facebook bans ads, everyone else bans ads, Facebook reverses its decision, gets mad traffic. Any takers?

What doesn't kill you...  
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:20:22
I agree. But I think other than quantifiable resources (like gas, crops, etc.) you can say this about anything. Point being, whether it's a golden rock or a digital asset it is what we make of it;

Great to see blockchain spreading to areas non-finance related, like the article mentions (Electronic document distributions between countries; Marine logistics; Easy real estate; Online voting; Personal customs clearance;) Management of livestock records). This is the true steps needed for mass adoption - making it part of daily life. 
Having said that, everyone needs to tread lightly. The South Korean government has been coming down hard on anything cyrpto related in the last few months ([ which still didn't stop Bithumb, second largest cryptoexchange in Asia, from suffering one of the greatest hacks of the year ([ I'm not a regulation advocate but I agree with u/c1hyuk that there is room for it here.

One of the biggest differences with this application is the the overwhelming support in the request for comments by the SEC found here

People use Bitcoin to buy other coins. A lot of exchanges dont allow fiat so you need to buy bitcoin in order to trade.
