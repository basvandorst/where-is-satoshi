The bills aren't counterfeit, they're just not accepted in Peru because probably like half the bills with that serial number in the country are counterfeit. The guys complaining about not being able to choose which serial number bills he gets, but I'm sure an american bank would be happy to exchange it for a different one.

 You could literally just ask the bank for a different $100 bill.

Um more like people got the companies wrong. A lot of them. Tell the owners of Pets.com stocks how awesome the internet is. Is bitcoin 100x better than litecoin? Not really. Can anyone make another coin of some sort thats even better? yup. So even litecoin is overvalued really since its not like it has a large userbase. And thats users, not just share (coin?) holders.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:36:15
Both of those are pretty well established. Bitcoin is popular with what? Drug dealers, enthusiasts, and people looking set themselves up for life by hopping on the bandwagon.

So are you at all concerned that btc could crash and you lose half your net worth in a day? Or im guessing youre one of the people who got in early so a big drop doesnt really make a huge difference to you in the long run? And again even though you say you use btc on a regular basis I dont think thats the case for the majority of people buying into it right now. And whats the draw for new users if they get in at $4000 today and it drops to $2000 tomorrow. I just dont see a huge draw for using it over other currencies. And yeah you've been fine up until now cause the price keeps climbing. Growth like we've seen isnt at all sustainable. Thats why i think were headed for a big crash before bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency becomes as ubiquitous as the dollar. If it does

How are people not concerned by the fact that you can literally just make a copy of bitcoin and use that as a "currency" instead. Theres already litecoin and btc cash, the only reason any of this has value is speculation. To everyone saying its early, who doesnt know about bitcoin at this point? Its been through the news cycle a bunch theres only so many people that wanna get in on this phenomena. The whole world is hyped thats why prices are skyrocketing. Once the numbers of people throwing their money at this trying to get rich die down the price will drop. Once the biggest holders decide to exit the price will drop. Then we get to watch as people try to trade their internet currency for actual currency because the only thing bitcoin buys you is black market items and some other random stuff. How big is that market exactly? Plus the wait times and fees are ridiculous. Good products will come out of this, but everything in this market is so overvalued right now. Cant wait to watch a documentary on this whole thing tho. Keep buying everyone.

For what exactly do you use it for? I cant get over how inconvienient it is, long wait times, fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:55:56
Why bitcoin though? Why not litecoin or literally any other coin that pops up?

The end of that sounded like a cult rally. 30% of bitcoin is held in around 1000 wallets. Its not exactly a deep market. Anyways stock markets are all about making money, thats the very function of their existence. Anyways good luck with your new world government etc.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:41:40
Ill be waiting.

The technological possibilities are very cool. Im just not 100% convinced that bitcoin is going to be at the center of all of it. I dont think its as established, as a currency, as the market cap suggests. It is most definetly at the center of the cryptocurrency trade, but I think once the real competition sets in and all this bubble money disappears, we'll see companies with more than a website and some office furniture give btc a run for its money.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:57:15
I dunno seemed pretty accurate which parts do you not agree with?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:44:13
Its not good when you have a $60bn market caps worth of expectations riding on bitcoin being the chosen one. I would want zero competition. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:54:28
Once this reaches critical mass the price will start dropping. What happens then? Who actually uses bitcoin right now? Price is based on speculation not use. Whats stopping people from using other cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:51:15
And this is why the price of bitcoin is skyrocketing. Its not a long term investment. Gamble on the exchanges but this thing is gonna run out of steam at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:38:59
Are you on the "were in a bubble" side? Cause that sounds exactly like a speculative bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:42:05
So youre of the opinion that people are buying bitcoin to use it and not to hoard it for possible profits like people did with beanie babies, 80s baseball cards, and oh sure fucking tulips why not?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:39:51
Its the same train from the dot com bubble they just gave it some new paint
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:24:57
I really dont think everyone investing in bitcoin is overly concerned with a completely decentralized currency. Plus that alone doesnt make it viable. It still sucks to make payments with. If everyone cared so much how come the majority of people, me included still feel much better about a currency that is backed by a government. Just cause its decentralized doesnt mean it cant be manipulated either.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:46:29
Infinitely copyable. How does no one see this?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:10:02
Yeah definitely agree. Bitcoin though is entirely speculation right now.
