Very "professional" response from bot support on every my question:
Read the news again 
Date of news on their site
Closing of tradings on TRC/BTC, FTC/BTC, XPM/BTC
19.01.15 00:00 from admin
And they put available all coins again to deposit 2-3 months ago
WHY, WHY, WHY ???
and you can still deposit and there is no new announcement, so news was 1 year old and they put options to deposit 3 months ago

When they discontinued they remove trade, deposit, withdraw option from their exchange,
now before price goes up they put available options for deposit and withdraw, so you can deposit, coins are credited normally and fast, but when you want to withdraw they take your coins, and say you cant withdraw,
Why i deposit you ask?
Because when i saw available options for deposit/withdrawal (before i could't see that options) i thought that they will add it for trade, and every other person will think the same thing.
But no they just take our coins, on every normal exchange they will do manually withdraw on request, but no they just stop answering when i ask three simple questions:
*Why deposit and withdraw were available again recently if you wont trade it?
*Why deposit and withdraw worked until now when price goes up?
*Why you don’t want to send me my coins manually?

I know that now, they put it available again so i thought that they will add coins for trade, but it is a very well planned scam, that coin goes up 16x now, and will go higher more
