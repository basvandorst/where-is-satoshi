DEAR ROBOCOIN OPERATOR JORDAN KELLY IS TRYING TO FUCK YOU
Dear robocoin Operator.
Like me you paid alot of money for Robocoin machine and it is YOURS.
Today Jordan Kelly CEO of robocoin is threatening us all saying he will convert our machine into a login terminal for Jordans own centralised. proprietary, closed source,
web based system. This benefits him and his company as it steals YOUR CUSTOMERS and gives him more centralised power.
This is not in the spirit of bitcoin's decentralised freedom loving roots.
We as robocoin operators need to unite together and install open source software on our machines and cut Jordan out and his fees out.
I have spoken with who run free open source software on their machines. 
It is possible to buy a separate PC that you can run alongside the PC that comes in the safe.
You can then just reconnect the webcam and validator to this new PC and run the machine as a giant Lamassu.
This software may need tweaking to get it working with the cash acceptor that comes in the robocoin. Cash Acceptor MEI 252704022P1
Here's the robocoin manual: 
This is a call for help to the open source and bitcoin community to come together and make these bitcoin ATMs what they should be. Free and open.
I will be turning off my 4 robocoin machines until either Jordan backs down on this and commits to supporting version 1 software as he said he would or we have the
machines mnning on the lammgssu software.
I suggest we all turn off our machines together to show we won't be bullied into his new system.
Please show your support for this project either by replying or adding your voice to the reddit post where I have posted this letter.
