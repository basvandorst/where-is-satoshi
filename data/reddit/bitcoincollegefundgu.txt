horrible trade platform. Been trying to log in CONTINUOUSLY FOR HOURS. Withdraw screen logs you out if you can get to it. Junk. just trying to get the fuck outta there for days. Kraken- you suck dirty balls. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:20:18
well, folks are funding it ( throw in a little). so its a fund.
@_date: 2014-06-07 23:07:56
Thanks for your faith in me, and your donations. I can build it,, this is my business site russotile.com. I built it but man, I am slow and I thought the fellas would want to help, especially with finding a way for proof of donation. I think I can get some funding, and if I get bored with it I can surely find someone to keep it running. This is gonna be good. I gotta find a fair way to add kids, and not be accused of stealing. any suggestions?
@_date: 2014-06-05 05:44:32
wait a minute. this is an actual fund.
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:46:32
now that you said it out loud, it is obvious.
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:24:52
this has been one of the most relaxing days in 6 months for me. thanks for coming boys.
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:30:46
I started being the bitcoincollegefundguy a few days ago. I re-tip all that is given to me to new parents, encouraging them to save for their childrens future and explaining that when they grow up this few dollars could be a lot of money. Quite a few went out before I changed my username. yesterday I paid for the domain bitcoincollegefund.org, I am not sure how far this will go but im giving it a shot because its fun. changetip just offered to help me raise funds, tech support for the website, and use of their web advisors.

Thank you BashCo! I'm gonna have to change this to the Bashco Bitcoin College Fund. Seriously, you give a lot to all of us man, thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:11:35
 I appreciate your concerns and found that if you have a changetip account, or look in my history you can see where the bitcoin comes and goes. I am easy to ignore (no misleading titles), and will shut the hell up if the right people tell me to (or if I get downvoted to shit). every satoshi goes to the children of reddit. to be exact. I am very open to suggestions on how to do this as I am just making this up.
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:18:08
I only have 16.01616 btc left in the fund and there are two of them! I could use a little help if you guys are still playin'. THANKS!!! I really enjoy this.

hey that qr came up from the site. if it shouldn't be there would a moderator please remove.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:55:35
sorry to hear that. was thinking of giving another 1,000,000 satoshi today and picking a kid is the best part! C'mon man, get with the awesome feeling program! Oh, the account should be at least a few weeks old (not hard lining this rule), and the kid one year or less. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:51:59
thanks again!

thank you! any tips collected till then (plus the 10 mbtc) go in her donation!!!

Thank you very much. I will add another couple of bucks tomorrow after work and fishing, and pick another benefactor tomorrow night! watch for their post!
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:39:49
do you have any ideas on how I should better get this started?
@_date: 2014-06-06 11:32:19
thank you . I did not know how to create it. My plan is to get this running and step down myself. I don't do well with accusations of a scam, and I think an established charity may be willing to take it over once it is up. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:41:15

I am not offended, and your suspicions are justified. This is a new site and more content would be great, but time is my enemy here. Damn, I wish it would have only taken an hour to build. I am not a web designer and am working hard to get this started. please give suggestions on how I can make the site better (not being sarcastic) and legitimize what I am doing. constructive criticism is not a bad thing here.
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:34:35
sorry, thought someone else here (this is my main reddit) might be having this issue, and it would help more than just me.

@_date: 2014-06-01 19:52:34
if you knew how awesome it feels, its borderline self-serving. I figure 1000000 satoshi will be worth at the very least a couple grand in 18 years. I cant imagine looking back and seeing that I gave a bunch of random kids 5000 bucks with only a few nickles and dimes invested by our community!

I think the minimum return for a year hold is 63% (please correct me if I am wrong). 25 bucks x 25 years at 63% compounding interest is...........wait for it............1.2 million.

@_date: 2014-06-03 01:03:55
as I really don't know what to do with the website, how about this idea:
I have weebly drag and drop tied to my other site ( I know, bummer), so I will publish the generic page and take suggestions. Hopefully folks will take part and write tutorials, make a logo, we can post links to the couple of good videos on there......

well if he has been saving all coins, and using his initial cost plus electricity as a base price, he may be seeing  excellent results as he may actually be accumulating at a discounted price.

@_date: 2014-06-05 13:37:45

oops, he just changed his mind.
 nope. they're banned again.
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:19:42
well if they add to it they will, most express interest, come to say thanks and ask how to store it.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:04:41
No, they're not my kids. I have none. I have 35 nieces and nephews, and from a family of 10 kids. 
I will make an about us on the page, explaining my intent. In a nut shell:
  The tipping threads got me some tips. tipping outside this sub was encouraged. I hit the random button. Found and a few others. has a bunch of newborns, and I thought... man, if someone gives these kids a couple of bucks in bitcoin now....x18 years.... Then someone says "you should be the bitcoincollegefundguy". formerly this should all be in my old comments.
I already pay for my business website (russotile.com), which includes site building tools and stuff so the added expense is minimal. Maybe $100 a year later. So 9.95 for the first year is not much to pay to see if I can make something really cool happen. If it shuts down no one loses as-
I have no private keys. the parents changetip accounts are first used to give them a few bucks (lately 1000000 satoshi), then I ask them to make a paper wallet on bitaddress.org and give me the public key if they would like to be included on the new site. I don't make their wallets, and I really don't want the taxman hassling me over a bunch of bitcoin that passes through my hands in the event that this does take off. 
Yup, the feel good feeling. My girlfriend loves all the babies (dammit that just hit me like a train, ugh), I make a reasonable living, I own a few bitcoin, and I spend a lot of time on the web anyhow. So, thanks, I will pass it on to the next kid. Is that really so crazy?

Hi Anon! paid for bitcoincollegefund.org a week ago, haven't started work on it yet. was thinking of posting the donation and a real time ticker of the value.
@_date: 2014-06-01 01:36:17
well, as saying is as about as worthless as the U.S. dollar will be by then, and as far as I know Bitcoin is the only way to send micro-payments to them without it costing more than the gift itself, do you feel I should tell them to convert it to a fiat currency as a store of value? Because I for one believe that 5 bucks will not be worth a piece of burnt toast by the time they are 18, and I can say with certainty that the dollar has zero chance of rising in value as this is not the plan of the U.S. government nor of the federal reserve bank.
As your faith in my project to move the market tells me that I hold great power, maybe I should set up my booth outside an abortion clinic, and give a few bits to people who have abortions, thus ensuring the end of mankind. Mwaahhhaaahaaaaaaaaa.

thanks very much

fuckers. just ditched my iphone.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:25:08
awesome! save them coins! 
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:26:02
I swear every time I give away your money bitcoin goes up. If I run out of your Bitcoin, I will give them mine. one million satoshi at a time. this is too much fun and I will pay the bill myself if I must. If you don't trust me, donate to the child. If you don't trust the BABY (they are usually pretty trustworthy in my experience), then I will thank you for not downvoting this.
@_date: 2014-06-07 11:35:29
Justpull it BashCo. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:38:32
I am trying. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:42:39
edit: posted under the tip bot......AWESOME! your gifts are greatly appreciated man. there are three or four that pay most of the funding, and without you I could not do this. Obviously you are also believers in combination of Bitcoin and time, and these kids are gonna get a real kickstart! Woot!
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:11:05
oh its a mess. I agree. this is how I look at it to make sense of this.  B.00m,00u,ss
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:14:24
well said.

I will go away when a Moderator of this sub asks me to. Is this not bitcoin related? 
Please explain what it is that offends you.

"Great! Some people think reptiles from outerspace have taken over the bodies of world leaders. I would have essentially the same response to someone lurking around newborns and selling magical glasses to happy mothers that allow you to view the monsters in their true form." 
EVERYONE with an internet connection knows this is true, and that them there "glasses" can only be bought with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:02:19
maybe a proof of solvency on there. i dunno yet but its going pretty good so far.
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:19:47
thank you! in the pot for the next kid!!!!
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:44:24
if you move it one place each is the worth one tenth. like a stock splitting 10 for 1. its the same value. just easier to use.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:44:32
thanks BashCo. I have made many mistakes with this already. I second place jumping the gun on the website (I was really exited) to my lack of couth the other day when confronted by a few redditors regarding my intentions and integrity. I was childish and rude. They have a right to their opinions, and I have a responsibility to handle these issues without lashing back at them. Again, thanks a lot for your support with this, I will continue to do my best. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:41:46
this post does not violate any rule of this sub. 
middle aged yes. 
sorry to disappoint you, but I run my own business russotile.com, and my mom lives with me. please do not impose your short comings and jealousy on me.
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:09:56
I have no idea how to write code or anything. I have weebly drag and drop. I am going to write a who we are tomorrow. 
I would like to accept apps through the form available. 
kids less than 1 year old accepted. 
parent provides a public address any one can donate to. birthdays, Christmas,......
I think I can get sponsorship from changetip (they graciously offered help).
maybe post a pic of the infant, when accepted, and a bitcoin ticker with amount donated and a ticker to show the value in any currency.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:22:11
nothing like setting people up for extortion. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 05:21:27
the generosity of the bitcoin community shows no bounds. I have the time if they have the coin. I imagine looking back in 20 years and they have 50k from a randon gift on reddit. I am already proud of this, and I've just started.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:45:07
Any suggestions on how I can promote this project in a less "lame" way would be greatly appreciated. All donations are given to these kids. I personally have never asked for a satoshi, and have already spent quite a bit of my time and personal funds (websites are not free) to further this. I am really sorry you find this "lame", but I enjoy it, and will continue.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:09:04
well obviously a penny would be a deal, ten mbtc would be a deal. ok, I'll play. proof of coverage.
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:52:54
cant stop laughing at this kids face. should be the posterchild for bitcoin.

it means .666 bitcoin = 1 oz. of superdope.
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:00:19
cant really do that like this. i purchased the bitcoincollegefund.org site and was thinking of giving the parent a code to be redeemed on their 18 bday. i have a few ideas but nothing set in stone. 
any suggestions greatly appreciated. i am new to this charity thing.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:02:26

I dunno what to do. I paid for bitcoincollegefund.org and weebly drag and drop website creator, but have published nothing. I am going to put my changetip address on it and publish it tomorrow. then I am gonna ask for some content from please help.

they better deliver with this. this could actually be good news.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:07:29
wow. moral_agent has a good idea. hope this works out ok man. please keep us updated.
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:35:40
I don't even consider this criticism. This is necessary if I am to continue. Its very hard to get parents to even accept the initial donation, as they don't know what the heck I am talking about most of the time. Asking them for more personal information is gonna be a tough sell. I will work on a standard form for this, maybe they will feel more comfortable.
I only post the info given on the parents original post. No last names. No locations. I find a newborn in give them a few bucks, and ask if I can put their kid on my site. Following the links back a few pages you can see where I get the kids from. I cant expect anyone to do this, but its there if you look. 
So, make it a little more personal. add some info. Gotcha.
create a way to validate. ugh. not going to be easy. 
Thanks for your help. The only way to address these concerns is to know what they are, I will work on them.
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:51:19
For help on this. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:21:34
thanks man! 
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:01:26
well people fund it and those that receive the funds appreciate them. so you can post all you want, but this is going forward. good luck with all of your new projects that you have been working on too! hows the bitcoin jealousy and negativity project coming along?

you put your weed in there.
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:32:19
so taking 80-90% in admin fees would make this more reputable?
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:11:00
thanks very much man! I didn't see how much it was either but it went to the twins 2.8 million satoshi (about 18 bucks).

@_date: 2017-08-15 11:29:40
I don't think there was a Coinbase when bitcoin was at these prices. I could be wrong but...
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:20:15
hilarious. I laughed more than once.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:16:47
I would suggest (im just another asshole) buying in with 25% of said funds, then 25/25/25/ over three weeks. I would then figure a dollar amount I could weekly afford, and Dollar Cost Average invest from there on out. Good luck and welcome.

I think so. It's been running for years on and off when I'm active, on for around 2 weeks 24/7 and will continue. I'm looking for a laptop now so I plan to all but shut it down with the screen closed and leave it running in the basement. 17 in 8 out now,...

I was at 21. Had to sell at 380 for a 2000.00 loss to help out family member in need. Sucks, but it saved my sisters house. Been off this page for a year and a half it was so depressing for me. I just sent my whole .1 to an opendime usb. I gave away more than 1.0 on changetip. ugh.

thats what I thought, thank you.

Also, the younger ones parents have safes and probably couldn't figure out how to use them. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:54:38

@_date: 2017-07-30 17:09:06
I think it may be relatively calm. A lot of people seem to be set in their position. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:32:57
I have Bitcoin that I have been saving for my nieces and nephews and its time I gave them to them. Is this a safe way to gift them to them and for the kids to cold store them on? I haven't been well and I wanted to hand them personally to those they were promised to. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:38:04
My thinking is they will lose their wallet easier than these sticks. they go through electronics like water...
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:42:45
I have no affiliation with opendime, these things are easy to use and about 14 bucks.
