In the meme the vehicle purchased was a Ford Taurus. You purchased a Honda Accord, therefore it was obviously not personalized for you.
For it to have been personalized for you, the vehicle purchased in the meme would have needed to be a Honda Accord.

Don't use a USB! Electrum will display a QR code of the signed transaction on the airgapped PC. Just scan it with the webcam of the online PC and you can broadcast.

1. Download "BRD wallet" on your iPhone or Android phone. Setup a new wallet in the app, and write down the backup phrase!
2. Send your Bitcoin from the website to your BRD wallet.
3. Go to coinbase and verify your identity, including connecting your bank account. This will take a couple days most likely, and the bank verification will involve you checking your bank account and telling coinbase the exact amount of 2 small test deposits they will make into your account.
4. Once coinbase sends you the emails saying your identity and your bank account are both verified, send your Bitcoin from BRD wallet to Coinbase.
5. In coinbase, initiate a sell and your BTC will be converted into a USD balance.
6. Initiate a bank transfer of your USD balance in coinbase to your bank account.

You absolutely can if you take proper precautions relating to the generation of the code. If done properly an offline cold storage PC-generated wallet is secure.
Have an old PC? Download electrum and verify the download using GPG. Disable all networking permanently on the machine. Install electrum and generate your wallet. Write down the wallet seed and store it in a secure place.
When it comes time to spend, you'll need electrum on a second, internet-connected PC. You generate the transaction on the online PC, transfer the transaction to the offline pc, sign the transaction offline, and then transfer the signed transaction back to the online PC to broadcast.

I think you're making a common mistake -- thinking of a Bitcoin wallet as something that "holds" Bitcoin in the same way a money wallet holds dollar bills. Bitcoin aren't serialized things that can be held in a wallet. The Bitcoin network just stores a list of balances in a huge ledger, and your wallet is just a secret number that can prove to the network that you own whatever balance is recorded at your wallet's address.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:41:48
So to answer your question, the various types of Bitcoin wallet's (hardware, paper, brain, etc) are just different methods to store the secret number that proves to the network that you control the address, and whatever balance is associated with that address.

Lol, I legit did the same thing. Did everything but ACH the funds to mtgox at $0.50. Forgot about it until I looked again and it was $14. Bought in at $14 and promptly watched it peak at $30, only to plummet back to $2. 
I held though, and sold 80% at $17.5k in December. Was luck, not skill, I'll readily admit. Still paid off my house though.

I think a good compromise in security vs convenience for small to moderate amounts is an open source mobile wallet on a factory reset phone that is left in airplane mode when not spending from the phone.
If you have an old Android or iPhone, I'd dedicate that. Factory reset, sign in to App Store / Play Store with a new account only used for the task, and then install a good HD wallet.
I typically recommend BRD wallet as it's available on both iOS and Android, has been around a good while, and is fully open source.

Airgapped Electrum is ok for $1 billion+, imo. Just have to do it right. Hardware wallets make security easier, but if you have the technical knowledge there is no reason you can't use Electrum and sleep well at night.

I've been around Bitcoin for a long time and I can tell you that those with your self-righteous combative attitude have done far more harm to the ecosystem than people who fucking buy bitcoin and hold.
No one gets to dictate the "proper" use case, as you seem to want to do. If you think you're going to build a deflationary currency / store of value / ecash, etc, and you won't have speculation, you're completely out of touch. And if you think speculation is worse than non-adoption, I don't know what to tell you other than I think that's obviously wrong on it's face.
Adoption of all kinds should be encouraged.

Yes. It's not *the best* security, but I'd argue it's more than adequate for even $10k+ 
To get the best security possible out of this setup, factory reset the old phone, don't use your main Google / Apple account to download Eclair wallet, and then forget your WiFi network and activate airplane mode.
Only then would you create the wallet in Eclair.

There are only 720k shares outstanding of BRK.A 
What's your point? I mean I'm a bitcoin early adopter but it's relatively simple to calculate the market cap of a stock and then compare it to the total value of the assets of the company. Corporate valuations are based on this.
Of course we can argue about inflated P/E's &amp; overvaluations due to sentiment / speculation, but the value of Berkshire is grounded in real assets.
You can't post this in one breath and then demand to be taken seriously in the next.

It's definitely a positive development in my opinion, but pump the brakes a bit. 
The vast majority of 401k's in the US offer a very limited menu of investment options, which are mostly mutual funds.
Almost no 401k's allow the trading of derivatives, including options.
So no, the majority of Americans will not have access in their 401k's. However, retail investors will have easy access to physically-settled bitcoin futures in their brokerage accounts should they desire it. This is still a great thing, but you aren't representing it accurately.

The Coinbase app is not a wallet. It's just an interface to their website, but your coin is still in Coinbase custody.

You're talking past me rather than responding to any of the points in my comments. You need to dial down the rhetoric if you want me to actually engage in a conversation with you, because currently we're not having one.
You do realize that real assets will hedge against inflation, correct? Not what the government posits the inflation rate is, but the actual rate of inflation?
I made no statements related to my trust, or lack thereof, in any central government, but again you're using my replies as a launching point for your diatribes rather than for honest discourse.

The NTSB released stats on this back in 2009. As you guessed, the smaller the diameter, the less likely the damage. According to the NTSB research, an 18" tire will, on average, experience 1 failure per block of 1 million tires, every 10 minutes. Stated another way, 18" tires experience 1 failure per 1MT block, every 10 minutes.
The top tier tire manufacturers have been able to improve on this failure rate with extensive R&amp;D, and in 2017 introduced a technology that reduced failures on 18" tires to an expected average of 1 failure per 1.8MT, per 10 minutes. Adoption of these new state-of-the-art tires has been surprisingly slow, but is expected to increase as aging infrastructure and road conditions continue to deteriorate.
Also, it should be noted, in 2017 a small fringe group of NTSB workers (made up mostly of the NTSB janitorial staff and a few engineers who had obtained their positions in the organization through nepotism) released a competing study that claimed the larger the tire, the lower the failure rate.
Taking this now-discredited research to its logical conclusion, some in this group were advocating for 80" monster truck tires to be mandated on all passenger vehicles (arguing a 80" tire would result in just 1 failure per 8MT block, every 10 minutes). This effort failed as expected, with the only long-term impact being a small group of disgraced ex-NTSB employees driving around in their lifted Honda Accords with monster-truck tires. 
At least they're easy to spot.

I'm well aware of monetary policy, thanks. The irony of that statement is lost on you I'm sure.
Do you think people keep the majority of their wealth in cash? It's not like fiat is the only game in town. Equities, real estate, commodities, etc all hedge inflation and preserve buying power over the long-term.
You say people are being robbed via loans and debt. Yet interest rates are historically low and borrowing is very cheap.

With $200 of savings, you can buy $200 worth of real estate (REITs), equities &amp; commodities (mutual funds). In other words, you could protect 100% of your savings from inflation.
Another way to protect your income from inflation is by spending it. So continuing with your example, a low-earner who spends the majority of their income, slowly builds an emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses, and then invests $200 / month in mutual funds, would have almost no significant exposure to inflation. (The emergency fund would lose to inflation but a high-interest savings account will slow this.) 
The biggest risk to an individual in this situation would be wage stagnation, which is why education and/or trade skills are critical tools for a worker to possess. This is why I am a strong supporter of free access to education for all (from pre-k through trade school / undergrad). It's a no-brainer investment for a society to make, as it will return far more than it costs via a reduction of need-based social welfare spending.

What the fuck are you going on about? Did you just take a logic class? Lol.
The question is not necessarily fallacious, nor are many potential answers. I don't think he's conflating the creator with the technology -- if you take his question at face value.
I'll answer the question (rather than draft an arrogant non-answer) -- one obvious consequence were Satoshi to prove control over their coins would be a large increase in the circulating supply of Bitcoin, which would presumably impact the per-unit price of Bitcoin as the market priced-in the newly-proven supply.

Wrong. In a Roth IRA the earnings are never taxed. That's a huge advantage over a taxable account. In a traditional IRA everything is taxed at withdrawal, but you've had growth on tax-free money for the decades preceding withdrawal.

I agree, however, there is one extremely important note when sending funds from a paper wallet -- you must send the entire balance from the paper wallet address in a single transaction. If you send any amount less than the entire balance, the remainder will be sent to a change address that you will not know the private key for, and the balance is lost. 
Many coins have been lost when people test send a small amount from a paper wallet. I find it easiest to think of a paper wallet as a single-use send address, and to use purpose-built sweep tools like those provided in electrum or trezor. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:35:56
I would use electrum offline. This means downloading electrum, verifying the hash of the download to ensure it hasn't been tampered with, and installing it to a machine that isn't connected to the web.
In electrum on that offline machine, you would create a new electrum wallet, then go to Wallet menu | Private Keys | Sweep. 
You'll enter your paper wallet's private key there, then click sweep. It will transfer the entire balance at the paper wallet address to your newly created electrum offline wallet.
To then sell on an exchange, you would need another install of electrum on an online computer. You import your XPUB key into the online electrum install, then create a transaction sending your coins to the exchange address. Transfer the unsigned transaction via USB to the offline pc, sign the transaction, and transfer it back to the online pc, where you broadcast it.
Simple.

Of course banks in the US can create money. That's what fractional reserve banking is. When a bank issues a loan they are creating money, in a real sense. They are lending out a multiple of the amount of money they have taken in via deposits.

I firmly believe if I had much more, or less, crypto than I had at the time, I wouldn't have timed it nearly as well. The fact that it became a life-changing amount of money for me right near the top made me look much smarter than I actually am.
