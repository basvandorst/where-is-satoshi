My friend. You should do what ever it takes buy as much as you can still. You still have time

sounds like you are pushing a sell agenda for whatever reason.
Anyway OP if you use a wallet like bitpay or similar the fees are higher. if you use a hardware wallet like the trezor or even gdax the fees aren't so bad. but bitpay and similar are charging $50 a transaction, which is bs. the exchange you're sending it to may also be taking some out.

What is 2/3rds of a DiVinci. Can't figure it out. Is she saying she thinks it'll be 80Million lol?

lol you are an aggressive troll. I notice you post a lot about trolls and scams, which is funny. Do you think the bitcoin bubble or the financial market bubble is more likely to pop? if you think its bitcoin, why are you commenting on here? especially when the signals point otherwise

the reason that FUD is fucking impossible to avoid is that the powers that be were late to the party and they want to do anything possible to keep it low for as long as possible.

I think the best advice I've seen on here is that in a year 8K will be the new low, so if you have the funds and are ready to hodl for life now's the best time
ps don't buy bitcash lol

I agree that it is concerning that a small group made/ unmade this decision. But I agree with u/carbonetc that we just demonstrated that us as the people of bitcoin convinced them to not go through another fork. So I think this is positive in all ways

lol I had to pause YT and laugh for a few seconds after she said that. The other guy and the main hostess were good though, or at least intelligently questioning it. Obviously the network people in their ears were coming up with rebuttals hahah
