Are they reliable? I'm thinking of this thread:  and that they have no "real" office. Just a forwarding adress.

Yes, I use electrum but I was thinking more of a dedicated hardware wallet.

I agree completely, but even for me that is driven by the potential change crypto will bring to the world - the increased value is starting to get so high I can't ignore the benefits for me personally. It's not what I want, but I'm shaped by the society around me.
Nonetheless, I think the primary focus should be the revolutionary aspect.

Sorry no, based in Sweden. We have some local exchanges here as well which I trust, but they are really really expensive.

I even dislike the word "investing". I put money in bitcoin because I believe in the currency and the power that it has to transform our economic structure. Yes, it's hard to ignore that the value increases, but in the end - I don't care if I lose all my money. I do this because I believe. I wish everyone else would, as well.
