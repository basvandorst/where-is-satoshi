Tell them it's like the stock market but not exactly.
Find articles from trustworthy sources that have reported on the legalities of crypto currencies and show them.
Are you in the US?
If so it's important that you record the price you bought at and the price you sold at for capital gains tax or else you might be in a bit of trouble and have to pay more money come tax season.
Capital gains applies even if you're trading from crypto to crypto, which really sucks since you're not moving it into cash to pay taxes with it.
If you mined it, you were technically suppose to report the price at which you mined it as income and any trades after that in capital gains.

I actually wonder about this.
Lets say bitcoin replaces fiat. Bitcoin is deflationary. As bitcoin deflates companies will move to cost of living decreases in order to prevent paying a wtf salary to a guy who's been there 30 years.
So they start doing that and you take a out a loan. Like a 30 year loan on a house. So you owe 40 btc to a bank. So what happens as btc deflates and you inevitably are underwater?

Wow I hadn't stopped by in a while. So let me get this straight. BCH, the coin that was like "FUCK SEGWIT AND LAYER 2", realized they were wrong. But, instead of just going "hey guys we were wrong." they created their own layer 2 that disables the break through that blockchain technology solved?

Surprisingly warm reception for them.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:23:38
This is a comparison of buy to sell orders. Since bitcoin markets sell on a first come first serve basis anyone who wants to sell right now must sell below the sell wall, anyone who wants to buy right now must buy above the buy wall.
An increase of sell or buy orders is called pressure. If there is an increase of sell orders the sell pressure will push the price down, the same applies to buy orders.
The walls in this case are where the pressure has collided since there is such a high demand to both buy and sell. Often times large holders of crypto will put up a lot of sell or buy volume in order to force the price in one direction or another. This is unethical and if it weren't for the current unregulated status of bitcoin it would be illegal. This might be the case here where two whales want to manipulate the price but it's not guaranteed.

I dunno man, redundancy is good in some cases.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:19:06
Buy walls are massive amounts of buy orders, orders are served on a first come basis. So if there's a wall and people want to buy, they have to place their buy orders higher than the wall. The same happens with sell walls except the sellers have to sell at a price lower than the wall.
Whales set walls with no intention of buying or selling but for manipulating the market. This is very unethical and if it weren't for the unregulated nature of bitcoin it would be illegal.

No, in theory it's good for the system as it creates a better dispersion of the coins. The more people who have and can use bitcoin the more valuable the currency becomes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:52:38
Yeah that was the point, now they can save all that money because it's digital.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:07:04
They place the sell/buy order then remove it when it starts to sell and retreat to a safer price. Walls create pressure one way or the other but they don't always out pressure the natural pressure from individuals.

Without a faster way of sending data between planets, each planet would probably develop their own set of crypto currencies. Planets would then need second a layer of coins to represent trades of currency between each planet. The system would need to be specifically designed to function with slow transmission of data in mind and it would probably need to be centralized to planetary government hubs with exchanges set at space ports.
