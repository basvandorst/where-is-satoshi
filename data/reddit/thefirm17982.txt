Er...what's arbitrage? 
Edit: Never mind, just found out
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:38:50
I need a partner from the states or wherever bitcoin is cheap in order for this to happen. Can't do it by myself :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:53:18
To make it short, bitcoin trading is being banned to PEOPLE UNDER 19. The end
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:58
It's 20K on bithumb
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:05:14
Bought at a million dollars, hodling until it hits 10 million
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:09:34
I put 50 percent of my money on bitcoin, 30 percent on something which price doesn't change that much such as bitcoin gold or dash(for some reason I know I'm going to get a lot of hate on this ) and 20 percent on something risky such as bitcoin cash.
If bitcoin cash takes a dip I sell my dash and put it in bitcoin cash, sell once the price is stablized and put it into dash.
If bitcoin cash gets a fork I sell most of it and put it in dash (or bitcoin if bitcoin's price is stable)
If bitcoin's going up I sell my dash and buy bitcoin, hodl for a while and then buy the same amount of dash. No change in dash and I get a bit of more bitcoin.
I know my plan is not that safe but that's just how I work :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:31:27
50 percent in bitcoin, 30 in bitcoin cash and 20 in bitcoin gold
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:39:06
People currently are bitching about the gov banning bitcoin.
Fun fact: they aren't
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:02:56
Hold my beer
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:09:34
I have one simple question. What's your private key?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:54:33
What if they all invest in bitcoin mining, not bitcoin? Can anyone give me an idea of what will happen?
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:34:51
Congrats. Now I'm going to go back to bed and cry like the 6 year old I am
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:28:01
Try localbitcoin, bitcoin atms are expensive than the market price and the market price in korea is fucked up
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:21:51
I'm using a Korean bank account but I don't get it why bithumb would only allow withdraws to Korean bank accounts. Never heard that before
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:56:49
I'm fucked
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:11:37
I have 5 bitcoin (yeah I'm a rebel)
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:54:09
If you want I can promote it on my website. It's in Korea and related to gaming but I get decent views from America
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:23:09
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:06:51
To be frank, I doubt it. It's just another opportunity to sell some of my real estate and buy more bitcoin and brag about it
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:42:10
Er...maybe he didn't expect bitcoin to rise that much?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:26:22
Now someone can't take a joke, nor can he spell properly
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:06:50
Don't do it unless you want to ruin your life. I'm just a guy that has nothing to lose
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:44:37
If you're so worried memorize the words, tattoo them somewhere safe like your left ball. I'm sure you'll never forget them. Or you can just buy a trezor and save yourself from that painful experience
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:03:18
Not really. Coinbase-&gt;bithumb-&gt;withdraw to your local bank. Rinse and repeat. I've got 0.8 extra bitcoin by selling high on bithumb
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:35:20
Can you have it tattooed on your left ballsack? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:00:19
I used to sell PDF copies of game of thrones for a dollar there
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:37:26
My friend does
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:56:53
You can actually get one(and many more) for free, you just need a pen and some paper to doodle on^^
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:02:39
Get a gun, go to localbitcoin and steal their bitcoins. Works every time
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:02:13
I sold 125 blotters worth of copies, don't really remember the exact amount
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:07:19
We need more memes to support Venezuela
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:24:59
Just think of the Karma you can get...
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:56:35
High risk, high return. High return, high risk
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:59:28
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:47:52
Bought a few bitcoin, lost a few hundred but I know it's going to go up again
@_date: 2018-06-10 10:53:25
I think you mean 0.0006903 BTC
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:14:39
Zimbabwe dollars?
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:29:42
The catch is that he didn't put in the amount of bitcoin. He might mean one bitcoin or 5 thousand bitcoin so he's always right
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:25:04
There are people who sold bitcoin at 5800 and bought bitcoin cash at 2000
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:59:02
Well I never had a home to start with pal
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:46:44
Well I guess everyone has different opinions on everything. And to be frank, I was already going to be fired. Overheard some guys from HR in the throne-room saying I was going to be fired and I decided to do it the old fashion way by throwing my resignation to my boss's face
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:34:09
I don't, mind explaining?
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:19:52
Why do people assume that's a woman?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:02:13
I know I did this when I referred my dad's account...now I need to just figure out the password
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:23:12
THIS! IS! BITCOIN!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:40:58
In 5 years, people are going to say 'they paid 40 million for THIS?'
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:15:39
Quit my job to become a day trader. It's my 3th day!
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:07:56
Jeez, just found out that mine was hacked too..thanks man
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:42:20
You'll be the first guy I'll report to boss
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:30:50
If bitcoin is not over 10k at any point in 2017 I'll eat my actual left ball. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:36:49
Just remember, no double dips
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:49:37
Er...where did health insurance go?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:20:14
Dogecoin, because why not
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:47:03
Thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:09:56
RemindMe! 38 days "Did it hit 10k?"
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:51:41
I hope you do too, good luck on everything ^^
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:46
Buy low, sell high. If you're not going to go all in on daytrading BTC, just hodl. That's all I can say at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:25:55
Bon appetit
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:53:18
Hey, I sold every bitcoin (about 6?) I had at 21 grand because of the Korea Regulation, do you think I should buy right now or later?
How much do you think bitcoin is going to fall?
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:01:36
I've heard rumors that a brothel in Seoul accepts bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:21:52
I guess you're right, I wasn't thinking straight because of the pressure that I might lose my money. I guess I'll have to learn to enjoy that pressure. Thanks for the good advice FlowerEmperor.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:27:32
16, female and from africa with 5 kids to feed
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:00:26
Why not sell right now and buy more bitcoin at a cheaper price?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:56:15
Well I've been trading on it for half a year and there wasn't any problem...but I can agree that the design looks sketchy.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:18:06
비트코인 is bitcoin in Korean. I have 2.2ish of it currently
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:37:46
Is that Mark Cuban in the second picture?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:19:02
Thanks for the kind words! I didn't expect to see a fellow Korean on reddit, it was a nice surprise :)
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:58:50
Just curious, if bitcoin cash is bitcoin then why is it not called bitcoin? 
I mean, that's like saying this cat is the real dog.
Doesn't make much sense, mind explaining to me?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:23:09
10000 grand? That's 10 million...guess I'm moving to zimbabwe
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:31:07
Canada seems almost decent to live in now
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:58:04
Well the news got it wrong in SK so I thought that a lot of people would panic sell, so I would be able to get a few more bitcoin. Problem is, it still isn't dropping...
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:53:23
Guess it's time to buy again
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:31:51
It's money for trump
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:20:18
I'll recommend bithumb. You need to submit your ID but it's worth it
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:22:31
XD I guess I will once I sell my dash...
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:02:50
I wonder if they pay tax in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:23:34
Not sure, but I would be very surprised if there's a state that doesn't have taxes
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:27:41
I don't know if I should cry or laugh
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:40:02
What was your original job?
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:32:25
Guess I should charge more since it's illegal. Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:26:01
Why stop an a million?
