Not all funds will stay in Canada.

"You are an MSB if you are in business in Canada to offer any of the following services to the public:"
One of which is:
conducting transactions where you exchange one type of money or currency (like US dollars, Canadian dollars, or Euros) for another.
We plan to get past this problem by providing more than one bank account situated in different regions of the world where users will be able to make deposits. For example, should we encounter any problems with Canadian banking laws (Which to my knowledge we have not) Our operation can simply be routed through other countries that have less strict laws, as we are able to operate out of them, legally. (Please note I don't handle the banking end of things, I'm just marketing, but this is the answer i've been given in a nutshell)

Thank you for your suggestions. An internal discussion is still underway and we will soon determine a fee structure.
We will let everyone who signed up for updates know what it is once we have reached a position on this issue.

What would you consider a fair fee structure? Please let us know!

Then the FinTRAC person I spoke with must have been misinformed, as this was the information I was being told.
Thank you for enlightening us, We'll do further research into the matter and cancel our request if needed. Not sure why I was told otherwise, to be honest.

Our MSB Lisence is not yet aquired, we are in the process of getting on either in Canada, or another country with less restrictive laws. We hope that We will be granted a MSB Lisence as per the rules stated on the FINTRAC website.
Furthermore, we do more than simply exchange bitcoins, we are making an effort to also provide specific products and services that are money based as well.

Any entity or entities seeking to impose upon the free will of others, specifically in this case by using bitcoins to infringe upon the right of others to buy sell, trade, and use bitcoins otherwise in a transaction as intended through the spirit of bitcoin: To be able to anonymously, safely, and securely conduct your financial business without having to worry about a third party sticking their nose into something that is not their business. (Ala what USA did with Mt.Gox)

Hello, we cannot divulge too much information on our company specific protocols for handling FIAT currencies, because this is what makes us unique from our competitors.
However, we have made it very difficult for any one international adversary to be able to shut down or freeze any significant portion of any fiat funds deposited. More information may follow in the future in regards to this issue, as it is understandable why this would be something of great concern given the nature of this exchange.

Thank you for your feedback! As it currently stands, we plan to charge absolutely no fees for any incoming funds at all, other than what your bank charges you when sending it.
This is not set in stone, however, there is a good chance it will remain as such.
