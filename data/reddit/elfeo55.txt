Mr. Robot is another classic example of life imitating art. I l I I absolutely love the show. This series is one artists rendition of how Bitcoin adoption will happen. The most powerful lobby in the world which now makes up over 20% of US GDP (and growing exponentially) is an overpowering force to be reckoned with.   The only way to leave fiat for crypto in a somewhat orderly and expeditious manner is if it comes from within the financial industry itself.

I don’t think he mentioned the dollar more than a couple of times total  ....been a rough couple weeks for fiat and especially USD. First they got a knee to the nuts (INSTEX), then it birthed a Frankenstein monster (Libra) and will eventually be decapitated by BTC.

Don't have to wait 25 years.....all you need an epic collapse of trust in the very fiat that keeps us enslaved to a system that perpetuates more devaluations until the masses around the planet begin to watch YouTube videos of turbulent nationalistic and populist events happening real time and realize how they are being screwed and start to understand what bitcoin can really do.

So if I understand correctly the scale goes:
$3,300 = 1 BTC 
   $330 = 1 dBTC or 1 deci-bit
     $33 = 1 cBTC or 1 centi-bit
     $3.3 = 1 mBTC or 1 millibit
What comes after millibit- micro-bit?
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:29:57
We should start talking about Deci-bits and Centi-bits and Mili-bits as many noobs prefer altcoins thinking they can get a better "POP" or better ROI for their investment. 
Typical conversation with a noob begins and ends with the high price of a whole bitcoin.  "Damn I shoulda listened to you last year" is a commonly heard phrase. 
I tell them it's not too late and they can buy a Deci-bit for roughly $400 or even a Centi-bit for around $40 bucks each and their eyes light up. "Yeah man sell me some of your Centi-bits, I can afford a few of those".

Just like every other "private" block chain, when you take away design features and try to domesticate the "savage" and disruptive  nature away from Bitcoin you end up with another centralized database that will eventually get hacked (too much of a honey pot to pass up)

When does the purge of BTC owners start?
@_date: 2017-04-12 01:58:41
If anything they are adopting BTC to circumvent the sanctions against them. Can't stop a monetary transfer that doesn't traverse on the SWIFT network

FTFY- Bitcoin is not like a Swiss bank account in your pocket....it's like an entire Swiss bank in your pocket.

Remember there is always a jurisdiction that will will adopt /allow the use of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:34:27
Simple just move to jurisdiction that accepts and embraces bitcoin. That's the society I prefer to live, work and retire into anyway.

So using limited history as our guide....one more bust cycle is likely in store soon  (like 2013) and then one more boom cycle  (like 2017)....means 2020 is the last boom TTM

Use other digital currencies for fast transactions. Use other digital currencies for adaptability and scale. Use Bitcoin as the reserve currency and mostly for transactions above $10MM - sort of like the new and improved Swift network.

From a compliance viewpoint this is how they plan to regulate it. 
Govt will come out and say:
"Bad for investment scary ups and down can lose your shirt!!"  
"Good for payments and payments like wires, ach, debit and credit cards falls under prevue of FinCen and IRS so yes we will allow as long as you provide identity and pay taxes on your gains."
Sneaky sneaky

Wouldn't a full on ban by a G-20 size country actually legitimize the threat BTC has on the incumbents?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:51:36
The countries who don't try to demonize it will ultimately become its biggest benefactors.....get ready to emigrate.
