When you get pay $2 for a whole month of your work and you can't even buy enough food for even a week, you know it's time to leave, until you realize you don't have the money to pay for a bus ticket to go to the neighbor state 100 km away from where you're, let alone pay for the ticket to go to the border with Colombia 900 km away.
It's depressing as fuck. It's suffocating, like being kidnapped in your routine from work to home and viceversa, the constant blackouts when you get home only make you feel more comfortable with the idea of taking your belonging in your backpack and go by foot and die trying to reach either Colombia or Brazil.
Here in my house we are currently living with $10 per month, and that shit is scary seeing how you've lost 10 pounds in only 6 months, considering you're already malnourished. The diet we can afford with $10 is mostly based on rice and potatoes, 1 or 2 meals per day to make it last long enough so we don't run out of food quickly.
I'm currently studying economic science and political sciences in Venezuela, feel free to ask me anything.

Something new that could help us are the cryptocurrencies. Since exchange controls and expropriations are our daily bread, getting monetary freedom will certainly improve things over here.

It's clear to me. Maduro's regime just did another scam and confiscated bitcoins from miners, as they have been doing since 2016 officially and publicly. Officials stole the bitcoin then laundered it as PDVSA bought it at skinny hen price.

I never heard of him but it seems he's popular since that presentation on Venezuela.
I know from where his arguments are and just by saying he believes the U.S is responsibly I know he basically copied a statement issued by the ministry of propaganda and communication in Venezuela and accomodated it for his presentation.

I don't think these are attacks from the U.S, and I doubt any venezuelan actually think like that. The constant blackouts are caused because the electricity grid is very limited and it suffers from lack of maintenance.
