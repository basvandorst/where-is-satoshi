In the financial world, one day of breach is huge.

But no broker/dealer behaves this way!
I've got friends on the street looking to see how my experience goes, and right now its been abysmal.

It's a broker/dealer. But no broker dealer I know of behaves this way. If I put in a buy order, and wanted to buy the dip, they'd let me.

Yeah, I'm just going to close my account and put a stop payment order in. Doubt they'll compensate me for my damages, but I'll still bill them.
The clearance date for my purchase is next week, when I'd anticipated much sooner, and the website simply does not allow me to execute the types of transactions I need to make using their service sensible. I've been trying to get help for these issues since yesterday, and now with the drop, and no response, I can't trust that they're acting in good faith.
Better to go with CampBX it looks like.

I don't need to buy/sell quickly; I don't care if it takes weeks to settle. I need to have my order responded to quickly. Any broker would accept my order. In fact, many would encourage me to sell out of a losing position so as not to cost me money, or would encourage me to buy into a dip in order to get more commission.
I don't know what's going on here.
I'm trying to act in good faith, but am finding myself behind handcuffed by restrictions which were not disclosed, and which should not be there. I'm trying to figure out why I should take on all this risk under different terms than what I agreed to, and with little to no communication from them.

The one I used is a VISA.

Currency or not, their selling financial services, and if they want me to accept the risk of this kind of exposure, they need to be a bit more forthcoming about the way they do business, as well as have some basic features that any broker would expect, or disclose limitations prior to initiating a sale.
What's very weird to me is since they don't operate as an exchange, and I am in essence buying coin directly from them, I really don't understand why I wouldn't be able to sell that coin back to them at their public offer price. They can wait until they have the money from the first transaction to begin processing the sale, but to block me from executing it makes no sense.
It's nopt just and for me, its bad for the community if people would participate in the community don't want to because the services are too immature.
