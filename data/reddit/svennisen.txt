I would argue that a choice made between slavery and death is not a choice at all. You don't choose life, it is simply human instinct to survive.
Yes, you could choose to fight back which probably lead to your death, but not doing so is not an active choice.
But you are right. Even though the argument is interesting, it is pretty useless. And by that I mean the interesting part is what we could consider a choice and not, not the slavery part.

I thought this was known for a long time? 3 weeks ago there where an article on the subject in metro, with a kapiton user who already filed a report. And a report to finansinspektionen.
It happened like this, first they did some changes to the site and he promised to be up and running after 24h.
Then 1 week passed, he then explained there was a problem with the bitcoin client and it would take another 48h to fix.
About 1.5 weeks passed and then came a post claiming there was some very hard technical problems and experts where brought in to solve it.
After that, not a word.
The site has been claiming to still support fiat deposits, but no btc withdrawal/deposits.
However, the person in the article mentioned above deposited fiat and did not receive any update on the site.
The owner, has since not been heard from, and he has hidden number, you can get in touch with his father but he wont comment. That is about it...
Here is the original reddit post about it:

And here is the article about it:

And he responded that there is a lot of coverage of btc in the media. I have read about bitcoin several times in the news.
There is an ATM in Stockholm and there are lots of startups dealing with btc. Several of Swedens big online retailers accept btc and you can buy pizza with btc in most parts of Sweden.
So saying Sweden is behind regarding Bitcoin is an exaggeration.
There is however only 2 exchanges where you can buy BTC for SEK...

I have done deals on kapiton.se, but that was a year ago and everything went fine. He hasn't only been stealing bitcoins but he has allowed people to deposit fiat to his bank account and disappeared with that as well.
Even though we have his name, rumor has it he is hiding abroad, I heard venezuela...
So the only way to get to him is to repeatedly report him to the police and get everyone affected to report him.
Swedish police -&gt; interpool etc etc. then either he will be caught or he will have to stay out of sweden, and every country who would turn him over to sweden, for at least 25 years.

No, working or not. soon 2 months of a non working site and complete silence.
I could rebuild his whole site in the two months it has gone for him to "fix it".
And without customer support, and money flowing in to the site without people getting it = SCAM.
@_date: 2014-01-23 05:58:10
I'm not really sure on that point. Since u can buy stuff with bitcoin, buying something could count as exchanging the actual goods value to sek.
It gets kind of wierd... An asset that already works as an currency with many companies in Sweden. I bought pizza with btc 1 week ago, wonder if I would have to file for extra tax for the value of the pizza... since the btc have gone up a couple of 1000 percent since I bought them.
Then again, they can control that can they?
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:44:46
It is always good practice to report illegal activities. Even though others already have done it, it should be no reason for you not to.
A fraud against you is a completely different crime than a fraud against another customer.
Sebastian could in this case be sentenced for several different cases of fraud ending up in a verdict based on all crimes committed together.
And even though you do not speak Swedish, and may not even live in Sweden? It should be reported at least for the statistical purpose, if the police receives several reports on the same company, odds are more resources are put to get to the bottom of it..
And as I explained in Swedish in my last post, you could call 11414 and make the report over phone. And if not, you can ask them there what to do as a foreigner scammed by a Swedish company and where you should address your complaints/report.
From another country the number would be +46 77 114 14 00.
It says like this on the police homepage:
















So in your case call the number and press 1. There can be quite a wait some times..

It is a valid question. Bitfinex is the largest exchange. Their office is in Hong Kong i believe and they play a big role in the asian market. Since it looks like a lot of this price hike is contributed to Japan and other asian countries it is not strange that it is bitfinex that is taking the biggest hit in new users and buyers, therefore being ahead in the price increase.
Thats my 2 cents anyways.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:00:51
I gave my father a paper wallet with 0.1 btc on fathers day :)
Gave it to him because he has consistently told me that bitcoin is just a temporary craze every time I have talked to him about it.
And he actually appreciated it! Didn't count on that :)

Nice :)
I actually did the same research this spring and got the same result. The biggest problem in sweden now is to get the banks to be cooperative with bitcoin companies.
I worked all summer on a project with bitcoin supply in sweden. I gave it up two months ago for different reasons. The biggest of them was that no swedish bank wanted to provide what I needed because they didn't want to be involved with bitcoin business.
To bad :( Will maybe give it another try when the general acceptance of bitcoin is higher. Anyways, thanks for posting this spreading the knowledge. We need bitcoin initiatives in sweden.

I will receive my 60GH/s in the next ~2 weeks, it is about to be shipped, just don't know if it will get stuck in customs. I just hope I can make payback in the next 6 months. Later than that 60GH/s will be like the jala is now... kind of worthless.
At least they are finally delivering products.

Am I wrong?
My perception of the litecoin rise in value right now is merely that it is speculative. Is there any litecoin infrastructure to speak of?
I realize that miners switch to litecoin to be able to make a profit. However is there any interest in litecoin right now except exchanges and pools? Does litecoin has what bitcoin have achieved, any form of purpose except that of storing value?
What I am reaching for.. is what is the reasong for anyone except miners to have interest in litecoin instead of bitcoin, is there any properties except faster mining I am looking over?
And if I might ask a lazy question, any recommendations on where to buy ltc if I live in europe?

You got to realize this doesn't make sense. BTC guild should statistically get as many blocks as their percentage of computing power on the network. But at the same time you will get as much reward as the percentage you contribute to the pool, in this case low since btcguild has lots of computing power.
If you join a smaller pool, yes they get fewer blocks, but your individual reward is greater. equal profit.

I'm not justifying anything, I am just saying although the pirate bay is used mostly to share copyrighted material, the service provided is not illegal.
Saying that is like saying bitcoin is illegal because it is used in several illegal implementations. The torrent protocol in it self i fully legal. 
Then it happens to be so that the lobbyist for the big productions companies is of a different opinion, and that they can influence the court in Sweden to judge the founders of pirate bay guilty. But that is just a way for them to target the site to get rid of it, which did not succeed.. You should watch TPB AFK, it is really quite sick the corruption involved in that court case.
For the record I use Pirate Bay and the torrent protocol for legal use, I share a lot of big (legal) files with my friends and it is the most efficient way to do it.

Actually wrote a little text about mixes yesterday, although not completely relevant, I'm gonna post it for the people who don't know what traffic analysis is.
Traffic analysis is the process of obtaining information about senders and receivers and their messages through analysing the messages and the transmission patterns. It is most often used when no other attack can be made to acquire information, for instance when all messages is encrypted and sender and receiver is unknown. Information is gathered regarding the size of packets, timing of sending and receiving, amount of packets etc.
In a broader scheme traffic analysis can be used to gather information such as what times transmissions happen, the frequency of transmissions, all to get a bigger picture on what purpose the sender/receiver is communicating.
Chaum Mixes protects to a certain extent agains traffic analysis through gathering messages and sending them in batches and therefore hindering timing analysis. The mix also deletes duplicates of messages so there is no possible way to connect a double message between sender and receiver. The sender adds radomes to the message as well, this protects agains guessing attacks on the message. To allow the receiver to respond an encrypted return address is sent with the message, it is encrypted with the public key to the mix, so to respond one only need to send it back to the mix and the mix decrypts the original sender address. However if an attacker gathers information on a large number of batches, it is still possible to identify a sender.
A bitcoin transaction mixer works by sending btc through a large amount of different addresses, but the concept is the same, you don't want for anyone to make the connection between sender &lt;-&gt; receiver.
However in the case of bitcoin this becomes more easy to attack as you say, since:
1. The user of the mix want low latency.
2. Ledger is public and comparison can be made on the transaction sums.
