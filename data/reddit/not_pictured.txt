So your argument is people would rather bitcoin fall into technological and financial obsolescence than agree to a change at some point?
The number of lines of code means what? Clearly it isn't a technical difficulty to change the code, the difficulty is consensus. That you even mention the number of lines of code tells me you either don't understand the issue or wish to make it sound like something it isn't.

Which behavior? Hypocrisy?


I didn't say they did. They could give a small fraction of the money they currently pay in taxes and the the causes they believe in will get more of their money. (unless their causes are war or corporate welfare)


My views are based on simple math. I believe you have decided to read FAR more into what I wrote than I actually wrote.
I am saying that if people could evade taxation then they would. Almost everyone. And those same people will still give charitably (some amount), and those people's money would better represent their non-hypocritical wants.

No, that isn't what it means. It means they 'owe' 100%, and have 103% at the ready to pay off people in case of a run. It could simply be (and probably is) profit from fee's that they have yet to extract from accounts. So long as they are aware what is owed and what they have in profit in those accounts the books are balanced.
An efficient business wouldn't allow profit to just sit like that (imo), but they may have valid reasons.

My knowledge of legal tender laws is limited to the US, but the US based theirs on English law (and the English off someone before them) so I imagine Australia is similar.
The pertinent parts of legal tender laws basically state that any public debt must be accepted in the currency that is 'legal tender' - *or else*. What is the 'or else'? It depends, but it usually is something like the police will take the item you want to purchase and give it to you. If they can't or it is a service they will threaten fines or jail.
In the US they were originally used to force everyone to start using USD instead of bank notes or state currencies (together making up the vast majority of economic transactions). Since the USD doesn't really require threats of violence to be accepted any more they have largely been ignored, repealed or fallen into obscurity. Don't pretend for a moment if people stopped wanting to use USD the government would hesitate to start fining, stealing and jailing people.
I reject the initiation of violence as moral. Legal tender laws are initiatory violence.

Na. Hell, anyone could have a list. Snoop Dogg (or whatever his name is right now) could have a list for instance.
All it would require is a person that is trusted (and known helps) and a well maintained list that is published. If you were trusted enough, you could make money charging people to get on your list, and you maintain trust be vetting properly. Though I am sure there will be some crowd sourced list that is free also. Wikivendors or something.
You could 'subscribe' to voucher lists of your choosing, and have only those venders even appear, or possibly just have 'customer reviews' load based on CUSTOMERS that are vouched for by list makers.
Basically a 'build-your-own' authority system.

Regulation means anything the state wants it to mean.


And how would they do that without controlling every aspect of bitcoin? They couldn't. I can do all that with USD and they DO control every aspect of it.

The purpose of the concept of property is to divide up a limited supply of stuff among a population with endless wants without violence.
Intellectual property is the concept that you can initiate violence against people who use an unlimited resource, ideas. The word 'property' is a misnomer. It's more akin to just using violence to stop competition. Violent monopolism.

Money laundering generally means hiding the source of money so it appears legitimately earned somehow other than how it was actually obtained.
This is something a bit different. You play a shell game (fogging?) with bitcoin so you can move coin from yourself to yourself without anyone being able to prove it. You would have to further launder the money if you wanted to spend it without giving up the shell game.

I really think we have to get comfortable with the idea many coins competing based on pure economic factors. Bitcoin will likely have some issues overcoming new economic issues that have never been seen before. Either bitcoin will get it 'right enough', or a competing coin will.
I think the rise and fall of currencies will likely be more like the rise and fall of a business.
I think bitcoin has a good likelihood to stay on top for a long time, as it can copy any successful strategies from other coins and will have the name recognition to keep it in the game.

This should be something someone who knows math should be able to graph. Let's see if it makes economical sense. My guess is it doesn't.
The number of transactions per second of this attack was around 35. The 'regular' amount is like 2. So even if those 2 people paid double the transaction fee that is still inconsequential.

Sure they will. The price of bitcoin is increased almost 100% due to speculation, and the price is decreased almost 100% due to miners selling their bitcoin.
A halving event will both increase speculation (far too much imo) and simultaneously halve the amount of bitcoin miners are selling.
Rationally self interested miners will hoard bitcoin (at least keep more than they usually do) leading up to the halving event so they can sell it afterwards. This will cause a reduction in sales leading up to the halving event making it a smoother transition, and the slow sell off afterwards will equally smooth the other side.
Upward pricing is the only possibility without massive outside factors.

Simple market price pressure should do the trick. Try multiple routes and pick the best for the price/latency/bandwidth (whatever you prefer). Stick with known good and fair routes, test new routes if price is raised.
In world wide scenario you could easily have services similar to DNS where you ask a trusted 3rd party for recommended routes. They would specialize in testing them all and keeping up to date documents to share with subscribers.
Private persons could invest in massive backbone infrastructure, and get paid similar to a toll road. Thus encouraging a competitive environment for growth.
Do you mean by "adversarial environment" that we have to go through ISP's currently, who would attempt to shut it down? I think that would be countered by the government. If not, neighbors could link to eachother in LANS and pay someone who can sneak access across LANS attempting to compete a total new internet. That would be tough though... :p

Everyone is actually limited by bandwidth and disk space, in the real world. The cap you refer to is not dissimilar to a 'minimum requirements' for a video game. Your system has to be able to handle that minimum or it doesn't work at all.
Knowing the minimum is good. Changing the minimum is also necessary over time.

I'd look into that Free State project thing seriously. Bitcoin achieving that sort of success counts as a lifetime win for Agorism, so I thought a bunch of millionairs 'sea-steading' a US state sounds like it could be reasonably effective. We could just buy the state government.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:29:08
So your just as likely to be correct as I am?
I'm not saying it wont have a rough patch, but the halving doesn't come out of left field. People will act in whatever way in in their self interest and that should cause a gradual increase in price leading up to the halving which should offset the halving. If bitcoin is worth 2x what it is now, there wouldn't be any reason to reduce mining power, and I don't think that's an unrealistic forecast. The only question is how gradual is gradual?
Hell, I'm not even disagreeing with you on that it would be nice to change. Just that it wont be as huge of an issue as you think it is.

I believe (I've been reading) the money can't be collected until the time lock expires by either party.
The exception being if the cheating party publishes an OLD transaction. You being the non-cheating party have a copy of a newer transaction. That newer transaction combined with the cheater's addition of an older transaction to the blockchain allow you to bypass the time restrictions on the bitcoin and collect it all right now.
You win because by the time their old transaction would collect the bitcoin from the time lock, it's already gone.

The miners are only incentivized to take the higher paying transactions. "Good" and "Bad" mean "more money" and "less money" respectively.
Don't assume for a moment that it works any other way. Either convince miners that weeding out spam is in their long term best interest, or change the system.
Personally I'm of the opinion that this attack can be totally ignored by simply having floating default transactions costs that beat spammers AND some self imposed system of censorship to keep the memory usage down (just enough to keep your miner from choking to death).
The bulk of the spam can easily be separated from the real transactions with a super basic filter.

Wouldn't this be a useful feature? If the Chinese could pay local nodes to improve their bandwidth with their energy savings they wouldn't have to worry about their ability to compete with the west.
I think this would be an amazing use of bitcoin funded mesh-net. I don't see why it wouldn't be feasible.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:12:11
Pretty smart. Though I think I can see some adoption problems.
You need a time lock for every entity, you only would use one if you expect to do multiple transactions (and the on chain transaction fee or time is unacceptably high). You both lose the ability to use those coins between other parties (yes?) until the timelock expires.
I can see having a lightning time lock with Walmart. Though I only do business with them every week or two, so to make sense the time lock would have to be on the order of months.
Am I saying anything wrong or ignorant?

It does a bit, though the new generation hasn't been tested thoroughly by independent parties yet. What's more important is it does it differently.
It's one half of a full quantum computer. To pretend the second half can't work despite no known physical limitation doesn't follow the trend of any other technology.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:52:13
Couldn't something similar be achieved simply by increasing the frequency of payment?
Instead of paying rent once a month, you can pay it once a day. Your employer can pay you once a day. Etc.

It's high value exactly because it's hard to get. The current miners are making enough money to think it is worth their while. If they didn't they wouldn't.

The transaction fees for blocks above and below this one's average about 3 times higher. It looks to me like they are taking a financial hit on purpose to clear transaction numbers and totally fill the block for blockchain efficacy over income.

How much cost is too much for next block confirmation? Pretty context depending isn't it?
Right now it mostly isn't context dependent since everyone is paying roughly the same (save the spammers, which this also helps defeat).


Math. If for the last 100 blocks a fee of 0.0005 gets on the next block 99.99% of the time, why would you suppose it wont work on the next block?

ASIC's are inevitable no matter what.
It's better that bitcoin is past the stage of admitting it. Right now to mine profitably you have to spend large amounts of money on hardware that can only be used to mine bitcoin. This makes trying to kill bitcoin more expensive for would-be attackers. If they could just use general purpose computers than they can just sell of the computers after attacking bitcoin.

Assuming consensus absolutely nothing would happen. The patch can not happen without at least 75% of the mining power going toward it.
If there is a 'fight', you will temporarily have two different monies on two different block chains. You could simply wait for a winner (there will be one).
Alternatively, if you think you know which will win, you could try to sell the other currency to someone who disagrees with you. This could be dangerous if you get it wrong. :x

You can transmit one satoshi just fine, so long as you can get a miner to include it in the block. Usually that means a miners fee of about 2 cents (so a total cost of 2 cents and 1 satoshi). But you can work an off chain deal out with a miner like 21 inc does for their hardware.
The definition of 'dust' is subjective, and can be changed to fit the context. If Visa wanted to start putting stuff on bitcoin for 1 satoshi, wouldn't you feel it would be acceptable to not count that as 'dust' because it's obviously a boon to bitcoin?

From the first thing I clicked (quantum computer potential):
"Consider a problem that has these four properties:
1. The only way to solve it is to guess answers repeatedly and check them,

I'll concede the "one cycle" was incorrect, but the use of 'only' here implies this isn't dangerous to bitcoin.
A functional Grover's algorithm is a security reduction of ~%99.99999999999999999999999999999999999997.
You can argue the address space is sufficiently large that such a reduction isn't enough to hurt bitcoin (and that may be true currently) but this is substantial.

I suspect this is a result of flawed fee calculators not understanding how to interpret ignored transactions due to the attack, combined with a bit of a positive feedback from multiple wallets sharing identical scripts to calculate the fee.
There needs to be variety even between identical software wallets, and it needs to be smarter. There isn't any pressure from wallet software to reduce the fee once we've entered this loop.

That's a bit unknown seeing as the time between now and then is the same as between the invention of the airplane and now.


There is nothing about the current hash rate that is 'exorbitant'. It's a function of expected return on investment.


What, in your mind, is the appropriate hash rate? How could you possibly determine it? The rate at which an attack is unfeasible? Well, we aren't there yet.
The rate at which an attack is 'hard'? How hard? Sounds totally arbitrary.
The hash rate is like a condom. When does a condom become 'too good'? How close to 'good enough' are you willing to go?

I think the best system is the notary gets paid a default sum regardless.
This would incentivize notaries to choose trustworthy buyers and sellers (less work!) and push the price down for their services. Honesty being the true coin of the land.
Less reputable people will have to go to the notaries willing to accept a higher fee and more work.
This would be the cheapest and the most honest configuration.

What would happen if the expected inflation of 8% per year (then 4%, 2%, 1% etc over 4 years each) became 0?
You have to understand where these numbers (such as the price of bitcoin) come from.
I can't answer that question, but it's reasonable to assume after much price finding, the target hash rate should be pretty similar.


The difficulty is set by the average needed to achieve 10 min block solves.
The hash rate is determined by market forces. (price, profit etc) But only right now. I'd expect in 100 years the hash rate will resemble more of an upkeep cost or at least far less dependent on market rates. (think a space heater that mines bitcoin instead of just heating wires)

Well, seeing as we expect new players who have little or no bitcoin, the initial moves should be up. Unless an old timer or a miner feels that this would be a good time to offload (which it wont be until a price spike).

Well, to oversimplify quantum computers, what they 'do' is try multiple things simultaneously. Any massive parallel set of computations benefits from quantum computers.
A theoretical quantum bitcoin miner for example could be a single asic that tries all possibilities simultaneously.
There is nothing about sha2 that makes it even slightly resistant to a quantum computer.

Quantum computers are a threat to so many things it would be tough to name them all.
This is the financial version of an asteroid hitting earth, everyone dies. We will either have to suffer through and make bitcoin work once we know what we are fighting against exactly, or we have to rebuild on the other side like everything else. Every money system is just as at risk.
We aren't close to being at risk yet though.

I never said they were magical. Your poisoning the well by saying such things.
Those 'subset of problems' include sha2.
Quantum computers DO NOT EXIST YET. There has been a 3 q-bit real quantum computer, but it only succeeded at factoring 15, and got it wrong most of time. (2x7=15~!)
The only usable "quantum computer" is D-waves quantum annealing machine, and IT can only do a very small subset of problems because it is not a universal computer. I believe this is where you are getting confused.
A real high qbit full quantum computer can solve sha2 in one cycle. (and to repeat myself, the closest we have come is one with 3 qbits and it got the answer wrong a lot.)
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:16:02


Semantics are whatever. Sure.
It's relative. The actual inflation of bitcoin right now is probably the number one cause of its actual price. It's not so much 'baked in' as reason numero uno that bitcoin is USD 245~ and not higher.
The halving will decrease the inflation. The question is will that decrease in inflation be represented in the price now, later or already is?
That bitcoin is EVENTUALLY deflationary is probably the number one reason anyone values bitcoin at all, or at least is a necessary pre-condition, so it's clearly baked in even though it ISN'T deflationary yet.
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:36:50
That's called buying the rumor and selling the fact. Bitcoins price should fall post halving (compared to the week before) but the question is how high will the price get leading up.
Both should be "higher than now".

I have read every single word published in her name. I know Objectivism in and out. If a group of people have a monopoly on the use of retaliatory violence, backed by force, it is non-voluntary.
If you will be met by violence for trying to compete with the government, it is non-voluntary.
Objectivists are not voluntarists because they allow for some non-voluntary relationships.

Oh Jesus. Objectivism has definite features. Volentaryism has definite features.
They is a lot of overlap, but not 100%.
I don't call myself an Objectivist out of respect of Ayn Rand (and definitions).
"If you wonder why I am so particular about protecting the integrity of the term “Objectivism,” my reason is that “Objectivism” is the name I have given to my philosophy—therefore, anyone using that name for some philosophical hodgepodge of his own, without my knowledge or consent, is guilty of the fraudulent presumption of trying to put thoughts into my brain (or of trying to pass his thinking off as mine—an attempt which fails, for obvious reasons). I chose the name “Objectivism” at a time when my philosophy was beginning to be known and some people were starting to call themselves “Randists.” I am much too conceited to allow such a use of my name…
What is the proper policy on this issue? If you agree with some tenets of Objectivism, but disagree with others, do not call yourself an Objectivist; give proper authorship credit for the parts you agree with—and then indulge in any flights of fancy you wish, on your own." - Ayn Rand
In turn, Ayn Rand wouldn't call herself a Voluntaryist, and neither should you.
