Your own thoughts do affect the price through conditional probability, at least as I reason.
Lets make a game. There is an opqaue bag of marbles. Each marble is either red or green, and each marble represents a person's prediciton about the price. Green means the price will rise and red means it will fall. You may choose just one marble out of the bag, and with this marble you must guess the majority color of the remaining marbles. Since the odds favor you choosing the majority color, whatever color you choose would be the most sound prediciton about the remaining marbles. The marble you choose corresponds to your own pessimism/optimisim about bitcoin. You can't know what others think, but it is more safe to assume that others think like you than not.

Pedes, you know what to do.

Normally you'd sell volatile investments that have done well in order to rebalance. Say you hold 1000 USD and 1 BTC. At todays prices your total volatility is halfway between USD and BTC. But if BTC outperforms USD then in the future your volatility will move towards BTC as it becomes a larger part of your wealth. Are you okay with higher risk investing as you become wealthier and older? Something to think about.... if you're not all-in right now, should you ever be?

What were your coins doing in an exchange in the first place? Moving them out should be the defualt i.e. you need a very good reason to have your coins in an exchange. And if you have a good reason then there's no need to worry about petty stuff like this... iow, if petty shit like this makes someone move their coins then they are not moving their coins in response to the proper stimuli. Always remeber mtgox and mybitcoinwallet.

You are crazy. We OTOH are governed by the rule of law. Oh, and SEC approval too.

You need wallet software to hold it. You can buy bitcoin on an exchange but always transfer it to your private wallet. I lost 50 BTC by keeping coins with an online wallet service. Never again.

Since you have it all figured out, it will do the opposite. Buy on the rumor, sell on the news.

It has failed. Good thing you got out in time.

Couldn't you argue that by keeping his funds out of the moving money he's causing the remainder of btc to be more valuable?

Gold. Platinum is a better deal right now historically but has different drivers than gold. All commodities are in the shitter, really. When you look at White House policy agricultural prices will probably rise before oil. I'd go for platinum and corn, but I already spent all my money on platinum and corn.

In Vietnam English, thousands &lt; hundreds &lt; millions... because when people say hundred they mean hundred-thousand. That's very confusing. With BTC, millionth &lt; thousandth &lt; hundreth. Until we start using hundred to mean hundred-thousandth in shorthand. Then... very confused. Good for taxi.

There are tungsten gold bars for sale. There is no tungsten bitcoin. If anything, I feel more secure trading in BTC. There is no BTC certificate of authenticity and THAT'S OKAY.

Divorce. Give her half of the bitcoin to do with as she pleases. Remarry with a prenup protecting your half.

Seems like a dumb idea to expose the eventual value of an address to the guy who makes the keys.

If I found a theoretical weakness in secp256k1, I wouldn't publish it right away. Source: not even a genius.

So cut/paste is probably worse than typing an address by hand?

There will be no need for tax because miners will govern. Sunny days ahead.
