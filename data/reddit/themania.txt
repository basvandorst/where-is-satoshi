I don't see how permissionless is a necessary property of a blockchain.
You can have a blockchain where someone needs to approve each addition or each new user, and still have it proof-of-work each existing entry at regular intervals to prevent tampering. That'd still count as a blockchain to me, would it not to you?

Yup. Just writing your friend an IOU is pretty close to money, if your friend trades that IOU with another, you're 9/10s the way there - you just need a financial institution that specialise in the creation and trading of these IOUs and you have money more or less as we know it.
You can say that the IOUs have to be represented by sea shells or gold, but that's hardly a necessary feature for the process.

For the level of security currently provided by Bitcoin, each block costs some $5600 to mine (mostly in electricity).
At the current rate of 700 transactions per block, that works out to some $8/transaction. This is currently nearly entirely paid for through inflation.
So don't kid yourself and come away thinking that transactions only "cost" is negligible - it's currently just *subsidised*. There's a difference. Now there is of course work into aggregating transactions, minimising the fees long-term, eg through lightning this and sidechain that, but as it currently stands transactions require a huge inflation-granted subsidy to be considered secure. Let's not forget that.

The Fed removed a few trillion worth of securities from circulation and replaced them with a few trillion worth of reserves. This means a graph of reserves will show a spike, despite that these *swaps* of financial assets have not altered our buying power much at all.

Similarly, if only the US would start accepting AUD for transactions no conversion or fees would be necessary.

It's a swap.
For every dollar put into circulation this way they remove a dollar worth of high valued financial assets. We lose Treasury Notes from the government that trade for $X, and gain Federal Reserve Notes from the Fed that trade for $X. We're not enriched by this, our buying power is not increased - it's a straight up swap.
Had the government actually gone along and spend a few $tn into existence outcomes would have been incredibly different, but it hasn't, so they aren't. What we see instead is a monetary base increase without a corresponding increase in spending that achieves stuff-all, basically.

@_date: 2014-12-23 04:10:41
Let me get this right. Loss/gain refers to your wealth, your assets. And you, on a bitcoin forum, are claiming that only how much fiat you own matters?
That you can't make a gain or a loss on a house, stock, bitcoin or anything else until you convert that asset into fiat? That nothing but how much fiat someone owns matters when it comes to determining their wealth?

Prices are set by supply and demand, not some vague-supply-and-demand-and-quantity-of-money.
QE increases the measurement we call the monetary base, but it *decreases* our holding of other financial assets. That is, $1tn of QE would be removing $1tn worth of securities from the private sector, whilst adding $1tn worth of reserves.
Now whether you hold $1000 worth of securities or $1000 worth of reserves, your wealth is the same. Your ability to assert demand is the same. So why would anyone expect QE to drive up prices, and/or devalue the dollar?

Due to them stockpiling USD.
We give them USD in exchange for imports. They save what they want, they buy exports with what they don't want. Ultimately when/if they decide to dissave that USD, those exports will still be purchased, for that's how much we owe them.
Thing is - if we decide to import less, they can still save all the USD they want. They need simply buy it off fx markets. The trade imbalance would still exist, we'd simply be both exporting *and* importing less. So decreasing imports does not necessarily imply decreasing the trade imbalance. However, foreigners deciding to stop stockpiling USD *will* lead to a reduced trade imbalance.

All a stagnant underemployed economy is is one taxed too highly for tge government's level of expenditure. Simply lowering taxes whilst keeping government expenditure the same would see growth. And it could do that - it's not like the government's going to run out of USD.

That's not true - formal currencies are [invariably backed by the state]( Quite easy to see why too - the state levies taxes in the state's currency, therefore you need to seek it out and/or store it to survive in the world.
Consider [hut taxes]( The British colonialists didn't get Africans to accept their currency by convincing them that it was rare and therefore somehow desirable, they simply levied a tax against them and bam, instant demand for the British currency. So no, currencies aren't "mostly independent of government say so" - the fact that the government levies trillions of dollars in taxes payable solely in USD is in fact the driving force of the entire fiat money system. If it weren't for that $3tn levy over 300mn citizens, whyever would the USD dominate so much?

A few of those would also appear on a list of cons. Eg "be your own bank" (responsible for your own security), public ledger (come on, who actually needs this other than law enforcement?

Free/1 penny tsrcts, depend on the current heavy block reward/mining subsidies. Once that decreases either security must decrease or fees must rise.
All the send/receive money 24/7 points (5 dot points?) is only true if you consider bitcoin money, which many people don't. One also has to wonder how bitcoin differentiates itself from paypal there, which has the added bonus of sending actual fiat money of any one of many different currencies.

Nono, I agree. If foreigners weren't stockpiling USD, the US would simply have a lower trade deficit.
All I'm saying is that the way you worded it made it sound like foreign countries are begrudgingly accepting USD to buy treasuries, which is fortunate, because we need them for the US's trade deficits. In reality, it's *because* foreigners are stockpiling USD that the US has a trade deficit in the first place.
All that said though:


Currency manipulation is a big reason for buying USD and sitting on it, irrespective of the return on that investment. China kept the yuan artificially devalued doing just that - that it was earning real returns at the time was just a bonus, but not the principle reason they were doing it.

There's a **lot** wrong with that introduction.
The biggest that stuck out to me:




Wrong wrong wrong wrong. Fiat money has value because it's not just paper, but a [tax credit](
The government spends and loans tax credits into existence, tax credits that you need to continuously redeem them if you want to be legally allowed to own property, earn an income, purchase goods/services, etc. We call these tax credits "money", and if you don't have enough of them you basically cannot function in life. That's why we value them so highly, why people will trade the majority of their life in pursuit of them. It's also why it's rational to have a retirement plan - a way to continue to be able to spend these tax credits once you're no longer working for them yourself.
Taxes are what underpins the whole of fiat money. If the government wasn't creating tax obligations, it'd find that it couldn't spend its money into existence and have people willingly accept it.




Wrong again. The central bank only gets to choose the base cost of money, the risk-free interest rate. From there the actual money supply varies with demand for loans from credit worthy customers that can afford that rate (+ the bank's markup).


(explanation that banks are limited by reserves)
Most wrong of all. There's a half dozen links [here]( from some of the world's institutions closest to money creation that completely discredit the theory that banks are limited by reserves.
Banks are limited by capital constraints and demand from credit worthy customers, **not** reserves, for loans *create* reserves. Heck, some countries (eg Australia) don't even have reserve constraints.
I don't know when it was first published but it's a -very- outdated piece that.

On a linear chart, the vertical axis may go "$1 $2 $3 $4". Going up one division means going up one unit of value.
On a log chart, the vertical axis may go "$1 $10 $100 $1000". Each  division represents a multiple of the previous division. On this scale, going up one division means the value has gone up 10x. Going down one division means it's gone down to 0.1x. Other scales like "$1 $2 $4 $8" may be used as well, with each division representing a doubling (rather than 10x).
Log charts are useful for viewing relative changes, and especially for values that climb exponentially such that the end value is a huge multiple of the starting value. Using log charts to show Bitcoin's value is contentious as exponential growth cannot be expected to continue forever, yet they may give the impression that *"if this trend continues, Bitcoin'll be at $200000000 by 2030"*, but anyway. They have their place.

Your statement was: "If the banks suddenly decide to lend it all". That implies that we're currently supply side limited for loans, that the only reason credit isn't exploding is because banks are being tight.
Your data does not back that up at all. You even say this in your reply - that it could be because households are *trying* to deleverage, and that we are therefore demand limited for loans. Not supply limited.
That was simply my point - banks have excess reserves not because they've "decided not to loan", but rather because we don't want to or cannot afford to borrow.


And what further complicates it is even in past times, when banks have had zero excess reserves, it is not correct to say that they couldn't have legally loaned more.
See, even in boom times, when excess reserves are zero, banks can borrow at the Federal Funds Rate - let's call this X%. By simply marking up this rate to cover risk and derive profit, and onselling this marked up rate to customers, say at X+3%, banks can loan to new customers *even when there are no excess reserves*.
It is for this reason that when you borrow money for a car loan nobody else has to go without a loan - banks simply borrow what is required and onsell the loan to you. In fact, it goes further - initially the bank doesn't even need to borrow, as when it loans money to you its reserve position is already met by the newly created deposits. It's only when you spend that loaned money and it pops up in a different bank that your bank actually has to go looking for more reserves, which it can always buy at a price fixed by the fed (the FFR, or X% above).
We are for that reason *always* demand limited for loans, and there's nothing particularly noteworthy about today's situation except that the Fed is allowing reserves to pool instead of draining them away through liquidity draining operations as it usually does.
@_date: 2014-01-22 01:32:35


Banks used to get 5%+ risk-free. Even then, because they were profit maximizers, they used to lend out for 7%+ despite that it required taking a bit of risk.
Now they're getting 0.25% risk-free - virtually 0% - but they "can't be bothered" loaning out for additional gains. Doesn't that seem odd to you?

Wait. So if interest on debt exceeded tax revenue, people would suddenly stop loaning USD to the US government? Would they still be willing to keep it as cash and/or loan it to households in this hypothetical?
Because in my mind, the US government is always going to be the safest entity you can loan USD to, which is why it always gets the lowest interest rates on debt. But you do not agree with this?

You haven't factored in speculators at all there. Speculators don't work on what the exchange is doing right this second, but rather what they think might happen in the future. They work on *speculation*.
To a speculator, someone provably destroying 1mn BTC would make them consider BTC worth more. After all, that's 1mn the exchanges will never see again. Now if there was 1mn BTC that had been mined a long time the past, but never ever touched, these people will weigh the probability that the keys have been lost, just as all those other BTC assumed lost from when it was essentially worthless.
So, to some probability, speculators'll assume those coins permanently removed. They'll value it accordingly a little more, for the likelihood that those coins had been removed.
Now what happens if someone demonstrates ownership? That probability goes to 0%. There's just no way to spin it that demonstrating that X coins, previously believed by many to be permanently lost, are not in fact lost, could be anything other than bad for the price.

Or the supplier could accept AUD and there'd be no need to exchange any currency at all.
Of course, the supplier being based in the US kind of needs USD to pay their taxes, and they know everyone around them will accept USD for the same reason... and they're (rightly) reluctant to accept a currency that isn't so immediately useful to them. Bitcoin falls into the exact same problem there, which is why currency exchanges are, and will remain, a thing.

The money multiplier theory is a complete [furphy]( in all this, irrelevant to how banks actually operate.
Banks can buy money off interbank lending markets at a rate managed by the Fed. The weighted average of this is the Federal Funds Rate, which the Fed targets (currently targeting 0&lt;x&lt;0.25%).
To maximize profits then, Banks simply mark up this rate and onsell it to any and all customers they can find that they believe can afford their rates.
That's all you need to know. Banks buy money at the Federal Funds Rate, and onsell it at their market rates, with demand for loans by credit worthy customers determining how many loans are made. The money multiplier theory (a supply side view of money, where you alter the money supply and banks magically make more loans) just doesn't come into it. We have a demand driven money supply. The difference is that when you/I borrow money for a car *nobody has to go without* because we've done so. More money simply enters circulation.

I'd agree with most of that except for this bit:


The foreign sector draining the US private+public sectors of USD is a large reason *why* the US public sector is stuck running deficits.
Think about it - if the US public sector was running a balanced budget, every USD that China and co puts aside would have to have come from the private sector, putting it further into debt. Better to have the issuer of the USD supply China with its USD savings than the US private sector, which is revenue constrained in how much it can borrow.
Also, the ability to run trade deficits *is* a benefit for the economy as a whole, at least today. Imports are a real gain for your economy (they're other people giving *you* stuff), exports a real cost (you working for someone else's consumption). Trade deficits are then you consuming more than you pay for, and in exchange all foreigners get are free-to-produce fiat. There's an argument to be made there that the US should never offer positive return on treasuries to ensure these deficits are never paid back with interest, and if you were to argue that I would agree.

If countries like China and Saudi Arabia were not stockpiling dollars, *there would not be a trade deficit*.

I generally am of the belief that the government is not in control of its bottom line.
By simple accounting the US public sector's surplus/deficit is the mirror image of the non-government's surplus/deficit.
To say that the US government is in control of its budget is to argue that the US private + foreign sectors are not in control of their own. It's arguing that the single government budget, determined largely by automatic stabilisers, wins out in a tug of war vs the combined budgets of millions of Americans and foreign entities, each with their own saving/dissaving preferences of USD.
Personally, I don't believe that to be true, and I believe there's ample evidence that even [harsh attempts]( to force public sector deficits down do not work. That when it comes down to the tug of war over whether the public sector will dissave or the non-public sector, the non-public sector tends to win out - even under harsh austerity.
Hence no, I wouldn't use the word "ability" (which makes it sound like deficits are of the government's volition), but rather "stuck" or "forced". They'd have great difficulty reining them in without wrecking the economy.


Fortunately not a problem when we're talking deficits run by the currency issuer. Japan's the best example of this. The aging Japanese private sector has been saving yen for years, putting the government into immense yen-denominated debt (over 1 quadrillion yen of debt now!), but it doesn't matter. Japan's credit-worthiness, in terms of yen, remains unquestioned, just as nobody thinks twice before loaning USD to the US or GBP to the UK. Currency issuers, quite simply, are not ever denied the same currency they issue.


The US non-government receives more money from the government than it pays in taxes. This makes the whole of the US beneficiaries to the desires of the foreign sector to stockpile USD.

Which is bad for security. If we want the network to remain *at least* as secure as it is today (and presumably we actually want it to be *more* secure), once the block reward is gone, total transaction fees will have to amount to *at least* $3mn a day.

Ability implies it's of their volition. It's not.
Stuck implies they they're going to do it whether they want to or not - and I would argue there is high political pressure to "rein in the deficits".
Even with the tea party in charge, they couldn't "pay back the debt" if they tried - at least not unless the non-public decided to dissave their USD savings.


See, I agree with that, but then your colloquial phrasing is: "Hey, they're letting me run larger deficits!" - when in reality it's "Hey, they're not paying me as much in taxes as I'm spending!". That is, the government basically is just left with the balance it finds at the end of the financial year which it doesn't have a great deal of control over one way or another.

Imports are paid for with exports.
If we import less, we sell less exports as a result. That's how trade works. They give us X, we give them Y. If we stop buying X, they stop receiving Y in return - for why would we give them Y if we're getting nothing in return?
This is explained well [here](
Free floating currencies don't change this - they just act on top of it. If you buy less, foreigners get less of your currency, so they can buy fewer of your exports. In any case, imports are still ultimately paid for with exports.

Yes, but the point is, to keep the network secure you need miners to be aptly rewarded.
Currently, that reward is ~$1mn/day. Going into the future, as I said, you need to accept either: much higher total transaction fees *or* a less secure network. If it's not at the moon by then (for sufficient tscts to cover the fees), it'll be left insecure and a poor store of value.
I'm also not very keen on the calling it a store of value really. Like Doge, all Bitcoin can promise you is 1BTC = 1BTC. In terms of real value, you're completely at the mercy of the market/who you can find to sell your BTC to, and lately that hasn't been looking too rosy for BTC. But hey.

Right. And stopping block reward halvings after 2025 also wouldn't affect the economics of mining because 2025 is far away and it'd be better for miners overall according to some guy on the net.

Just so you know it isn't "free money". To get $1mn worth of QE money, you have to surrender $1mn worth of very liquid financial assets. Your net wealth doesn't actually change, post-swap.
If the Fed was literally giving money away inflation would be through the roof, but it isn't, so it isn't.
Also.. note that when someone buys a stock or real estate, no money is depleted. It's just changed hands - now another "rich person" (presumably) has it - the previous owner of the stock/real estate. So I've never understood the argument that "QE money is just in stocks at the moment" - someone had to *leave* those stocks, acquiring that money, for another to buy the stock.

What, and you're saying that central banks can't do that? Why do you think the SNB's balance sheet [has been ballooning](


Actually for a myriad of reasons, that's not true. People would spend that windfall, and/or use it to pay back debt (which in turn enables them to take out more debt sooner than they otherwise would have), and this in turn results in more production - assuming the economy can meet the increased demand. If *it can't*, you'll get either shortages and/or price increases. You're arguing that the latter will always occur one-to-one, but there's nothing to say that it will. That's probably the least likely outcome, if anything.
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:02:08
No, I'm saying there's such as thing as [money markets]( / [interbank lending markets](
Banks issue loans. These create deposits. Transactions move funds throughout the day fairly randomly between banks. If a bank finds itself short of its reserve requirements at the end of the day, it [borrows funds from a bank]( that finds itself in surplus.
If, for some reason, liquidity dries up and banks aren't lending to one another, they can always turn to the Fed and borrow directly ([discount window lending]( but generally before that point rates on those markets will increase past the [federal funds target rate]( leading to the Fed performing [OMOs]( and restoring that rate to target, ensuring that banks *are* able to borrow (and lend) reserves to one another - that there's never a shortage.
In any case, for credit worthy banks (a status banks keep by loaning to credit worthy customers), those reserves are *guaranteed* to be able to be acquired. The Fed assures it - it's its job to ensure that the interbank lending markets are operating smoothly. Hence why if a bank thinks you can afford a loan, they're absolutely going to issue the loan. They can sort out there reserve position later.

The SNB devaluing the CHF meant that its balance sheet was growing yes. That it was owning more and more foreign assets.
That article centers around that - that there's a risk the SNB may have those assets it's acquiring lose value. Fair enough. That's not to say that it couldn't have kept on going indefinitely - there's no financial limit on how long the SNB could have kept on doing as it was doing - just that it may end up wasting Swiss wealth in doing so. That, again, it may be in their country's best interests to drop the cap.
Put another way, imagine you had someone capable of producing Bitcoins, and aiming to implement a cap at $100 USD/coin. They could do that easily, by simply placing an unlimited sell order at that price. What the zerohedge article is talking about is the seller of these coins then getting concerned about the USD they're accumulating (when people buy BTC off them), that they might end up losing wealth in it, and so dropping the cap as a result of those concerns. It's not that they *couldn't* keep on selling Bitcoin at that price, it's simply that they've decided that it's no longer prudent to, that they're unnecessarily risking wealth in doing so, and that perhaps it's not in the best interests of the Bitcoin economy to do so.

Right. Question: when was the last time a bank turned you away due to not having enough reserves? Have you ever heard *any* bank turning away a credit worthy customer due to that?
You haven't, have you. Proponents of the money multiplier theory would have you believe that they're doing it all the time though. And that adding $1 of reserves to a bank would lead to the banking sector finding $10 more in loans to write - for some reason. I don't know, perhaps they'll *make* the customers appear. And that equivalently, whenever you take out a car loan, the bank will now have to turn someone else away due to you depleting their reserves. It's a theory that's obviously very out of touch of reality, yet oddly many people come away from their cursory web searches believing that's how money works.
Reality is, as is so often the case, is actually far simpler.
Banks loan to any and all credit worthy customers that come knocking on their doors. If they think you're good for the loan, they'll issue it. This loan in turn *creates* deposits that we can hold as savings.
So it's not the savings of some little old grandma that the bank is loaning you, but rather the act of borrowing is *creating* the money that people then save. It should be no wonder that a credit crunch leads to people seemingly having no money, and that QE does little to improve that. Because all QE's doing is bolstering reserves, but banks not being reserve constrained means it does little to increase money in your or anyone else's accounts.

Proponents argue that it'd be hugely *stabilizing* to the value of fiat, as it's effectively a "minimum demand labor standard".
That is, if the fixed wage is $10, then you know both that you can always turn your time in to *at least* $10/hr, but also that you'll be able to pull a worker out of the JG by offering only slightly more than $10/hr (in the same way that firms can pull people out of takeaway stores by offering just a few cents an hour more). So labor becomes the standard on which fiat is based, with the fixed wage serving as a general price anchor.


The program buys "from the bottom", only employing people that would otherwise be unemployed. Those people are given a wage, and should those wages be spent in such a way that the private sector need expand, the JG shrinks. So profit motive all fully exists in the private sector, and it takes priority over the JG by offering wages higher than the fixed wage - same as today with the minimum wage.
Comparisons to communism are ridiculous - there is no private sector in communism. With a JG, you have a similar private sector to today, a similar public sector, but unemployment is replaced with fixed wage workers. It ends the waste that is unemployment.

Existing miners, existing valuation, has been built on an implementation where as the reward tapers off, transaction fees increase in value. You can argue as much as you like that this new system may be "better" for miners, but ultimately you can't get around the fact that you're *changing the economics of mining*. For better or for worse.
It's right there where you say "if we don't change this, we can't tell people Bitcoin has low fees!". You can't both say that, *and* say you're not changing the economics of mining.
As an aside, I do find it interesting that Bitcoin is currently subsidising miners to the order of [$10/transaction]( - block size change or no block size change, Bitcoin's either going to need to accept drastically reduced security or see a *huge* increase in both the number of transactions performed *and* the fees paid if we're going to allow this subsidy to continue to be lowered over time. .. You may well need to let "low fees" go at some point.

But in both cases the spread between the risk-free rate and the mortgage rate is the same, or at least very similar.
That is when the FFR was 5%, banks could invest completely risk-free and receive 5% returns. Or, they could loan to a customer at 7.5%, and get a bit more money - at the expense of taking a bit of risk.
Today, the FFR is 0.25%, so banks get 0.25% in a risk free fashion. Or they can loan to customers in the 2% range (similar spread to before), and get a bit more money - at the expense of risk.
If banks didn't like that spread - if they felt that 2% markups over the risk-free rate weren't enough to cover the risk - they wouldn't say "fuck it" and exit the market - they'd price their loans higher. And they'd get those customers that other banks figure are not worth the risk.
I'm just not seeing how interest rates being too low can possibly be a sign of a supply side constraint on lending - just like anything else, ow prices are a sign of ample supply for given demand, not the opposite.

Your response is similar though. It's that "if we removed minimum wages, in bad times people can just become night watchmen for the landed class Kenya style for $2/hr, it'll be fine". And then in good times, they'll be picked up more productively.
A JG is saying that private sector jobs that cannot produce a minimal amount of value are not worth having. That firms that depend on super-cheap laborers to, I dunno, replace easily automated tasks should exit the marketplace.
The reason for this is a) those firms aren't getting much from that labor anyway - we're not benefiting, it's literally ultra low value labor. b) those people in turn are *receiving* only ultra low value wages, lower than society would like to consider acceptable. and c) you're making people's livelihoods subject to swings in the private sector, whereas with a JG there's a reasonable floor imposed that serves as a very strong automatic stabilizer *bringing* stability.


Wow. So offering people full minimum wages for voluntary labor is "gulag", but starving people until they accept ultra-low wages is just "the market at work"? We should embrace the latter but sneer at the former why exactly?

With fractional reserve, you still have the promises of the people that owe you money. These themselves are worth money, and banks can borrow against them and trade them in exchange for the reserves they need.
What's happened here is the equivalent of someone going to the bank and stealing, or setting fire, to all those promises. Those financial assets. This leaves the ~~bank~~ cryptsy still owing the money to clients, but with nothing to show for it.
It is worse than fractional reserve. It is taking people's money when insolvent. To pay back past debts no less. Their actions are closer to Madoff's than that of any reputable bank.

Depends entirely on what the CB is targeting and the term of the bonds.
Generally, CBs target short-term rates, with long-term rates adjusting to predictions of CB policy (as long-term loans can be thought of a series of short-term loans with the rate set in advance). Higher volatility on CB policy = higher long term rates (as they're harder to predict).
Japan CB policy is easy to predict - rates will be zero to negative always - and so long-term rates also are zero to negative.
CBs are not limited to only setting short-term rates though, they can also opt to directly set long-term rates, or influence them via the like of QE.
The second factor is the term the government chooses to issue its bonds over. If the government is issuing short-term bonds, and the CB is setting short-term rates, the bonds will simply go for the rate the CB selects. You can see this in any currency-issuing country you care to look at - the government can always choose to borrow at a rate simply selected by the CB.
Should the government *choose* to issue longer term bonds than the CB is directly targeting, it'll suffer some more volatility and pay a little more for the privilege, but ultimately seeing as it's the nominally lowest risk entity you can loan that currency to it's always assured the best attainable rate in that currency. And that rate again, is still tied to CB policy.
It's why Australia pays more interest on AUD than Japan does yen, btw. Nothing to do with debt, everything to do with where the CB wants rates to be (and market predictions thereof, if you're extrapolating for longer term bonds).
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:39:35


The *issuer* sets the risk-free nominal return on free-floating currencies. Lenders of free-floating currencies don't get a word in edge-wise.
That is why Japan continues to be able to borrow for negative interest rates despite world-leading debt. It's why the UK/US/Canada/Australia can still borrow at rates their respective central banks set with nobody batting an eyelid.
Markets increasing rates against you is a crisis specific to people that are borrowing something outside of their control, like households, Greece, your business maybe - etc. For the US, it'd be unprecedented. Japan would have to run out of yen first, but despite books that don't make a lick of sense they still seem no closer to that today than they were a decade ago.

Greece is not an issuer of a currency, nor is it nominally risk-free to loan to. It's about as related to the Euro as Toyota is to the yen. Possibly less so, as I wouldn't be surprised if the Japanese gov't cares more about Toyota than the Troika and ECB do about Greece.
To reiterate: if you are borrowing a free-floating currency you issue, *you* get to set how much interest you are going to pay on it. *That's what it means to have a central bank setting interest rates*.
This is easy to demonstrate too. You only need the assumption that a gov't would sooner print than default: or better, rather than having markets "assume" this, [write it in to the constitution]( With this simple promise in place, the government instantly becomes *nominally risk-free to loan to*. Being nominally risk-free means that people would always sooner loan USD to the gov't over anyone else, and this means the gov't will never be short of lenders, which means it can never be forced to print *or* default. It can always borrow more.
That's the topsy turvy world of borrowing a free-floating currency that you issue. You literally can't run out of it. This is a very foreign concept to people that are familiar with credit cards, bank loans, etc. But that's because they're *not issuers*. They get confused, don't realise the significance of the difference.

A "token currency" that government employees would continue to accept their wages in, because the Bitcoin private sector would need to trade with them to be able to own land (or pay rent to their landlords). In effect, not a great deal would change.
The US government would be able to continue to print money, and that money would continue to be valued highly due to everyone's need to have it. Public sector employees would be paid in USD, private sector employees would need USD - you'd very likely even find that the USD would remain the dominant currency of trade. It's just simply more convenient to trade in USD than going government employee -&gt; trade for bitcoin -&gt; private sector -&gt; trade for USD -&gt; pay taxes.

I somehow doubt Visa requires 180MW per 100k transactions/day. Extrapolated, that'd be some 270GW of power they'd need to operate..
It all depends on the mining fees of course. Pretty much every dollar spent on tx fees+block rewards ends up going towards electricity, so as the reward diminishes (and security declines) so too will the energy wasted. If Bitcoin ever really takes off though it'd be a real problem, proof of work being "destroy so much electricity securing the chain that it's not worth being a bad actor for how invested you are" after all..

Well, it really depends on how the upgrade occurs.
If a day comes when Bitcoin is seen as less secure than a rival cryptocurrency, its value will ever-slide as people buy into the new currency. That was what I was imagining. After some date, few would be looking to buy Bitcoin - your old wallets would be worthless. You literally would not be able to find a buyer, a better currency has superseded it.
If Bitcoin is "upgraded" via a new currency float (Bitcoin 2.0) and a fixed-exchange rate, I guess there'll be no problem converting lost/stolen wallets to the new currency. This is what you were imagining then.
An advantage of the first technique is that if the vulnerability somehow uncovers the [78% of Bitcoins]( thought to be missing from circulation, those that manage to convert to the competing cryptocurrency before those crash down the exchange rate won't be hurt. The latter would have to end the fixed-exchange rate before these crashed down the value of Bitcoin 2.0 versus the USD, and anyone that has not yet converted (ie lost wallets) would be worthless.
So I guess just cross your fingers that the upgrade to Bitcoin offers a fixed-exchange rate with your current wallets and that a huge amount of Bitcoins aren't discovered once it's crackable down the road. If both of those hold, then yes, lost wallets would then be recoverable and "upgradeable".

Note that there will always be high base demand for the USD, merely by the US government demanding that you pay your taxes in it.
If you do not pay a sufficient amount of USD to cover your taxes, you lose everything basically. This creates a very real base need for the USD, and is how currencies were spread throughout the world. By the currency-issuer demanding you pay them in that currency, or else face penalties. Africans didn't care that the currency was backed by gold, they cared that if they didn't find a sufficient amount of it, [they lost their hut](

Actually, if the land value taxes are levied in USD it matters not what currency you do your transactions in. You'll buy the USD on exchange markets, and that currency will have worth - despite the fact that the government can "print more of it" at will.
If the government abolished all taxes but a land value tax, allowed any currency to be used for trade, the USD would continue to have high worth. Because people desire to own land on US soils, and to do so - they need to buy USD.
@_date: 2012-11-13 10:21:47


How much do you value owning or using US land? Because I'm guessing pretty bloody high. At that, there's not a chance you'd value the USD low. You, or at least many people, would value it as high as the government wants to you to value it via taxes.
We've already agreed, the government could make you value the USD *so much* that unemployment would rise (although I argue it shouldn't - it'd be pointless). That you'd sooner hold onto this "perpetually devaluing" currency than employ someone with it, because you don't want to lose your land.
You can't have it both ways. Either the government has so much control over your yearning for its currency that it can create unemployment, or it is forced to have a "low value" USD for lack of ability to make you desire it. Which is it?


This does prop up the USD exchange rate, yes, by encouraging even international buyers to hold it. It means the US (not just the government!) gets to consume more than it produces, running year on year of large trade deficits just so that other countries can acquire the dollar to use for trade.
It *is not required* for fiat money to have worth in the slightest. Australia/Singapore/New Zealand all get along just fine without their dollars being used to price oil.

It need not tax so highly that there's high unemployment for either. As long as there's some unemployment, there's slack in the economy and the government can deficit spend without harmful inflation.
It's when there's too much money chasing a fixed amount of resources that you get inflation - that's where the government needs to tax. To restrict the amount of buying the private sector is doing of that resource, to make room for itself. If it's made so much room for itself that both the public sector and private sector are ignoring the resource, it's just wasting output potential. There's nothing to be gained from doing so, at least not from the government's point of view.
@_date: 2012-11-13 10:29:59

Of course, if your business is highly mobile you can go elsewhere.
The vast majority of services *must* be produced in the country that consumes them though. Couriers, barbers, tavern owners, supermarket chains, cinemas, restaurants, landlords, electricity generation, mining (if your country has resources), etc.
All these services then require imports, and under floating exchange rates all imports must ultimately be paid for by exports - so once again floating exchange rates fix up the discrepancy. The need for services at home becomes a need for exports to be produced at home, and the floating exchange rate ensures that the export market remains competitive enough to ensure the services industry (and populace) can import what it needs/desires.
The *cost* then of too high a level taxation is more people working in the export sector (as the few lucrative businesses have moved elsewhere, leaving more less efficient businesses filling the gap) - not "government gives up and packs its bags". That's just not going to happen.

This is absurd. Why would the government levy taxes so high that nobody could afford to live there and/or work there? That gives the government *less* - in fact, zero - buying power, not more.
And what is the government doing with this money? Is it paying its own employees a sufficient wage to be able to afford a life + their land taxes? If so - there's still going to be goods/services being produced because those government employees then have a disposable of a sufficient amount to employ a private sector.
If not, what on Earth is the government taxing so highly for? Taxation and interest rate setting are how the government keeps the private sector at a size that the public sector can consume the resources (including labour) that it desires to without harmful price-level inflation, there's no point in taxing so highly that there's high unemployment that the government itself doesn't want to make use of.

Bitcoins *could* be adopted as the US currency, but I really hope it never is. It'd be even worse than the Euro as a model to adopt, and that's saying something.
Firstly, inflation of the price of some goods is inevitable, as is deflation. You can only ever fix one good or basket of goods and everything else must scale around it. The Fed chooses to make a basket of commonly used goods/services inflate at 2%. With Bitcoin, we peg the value of 1 Bitcoin of the past to 1 Bitcoin of the future, and *everything* else scales around it. It turns out that this is a whole lot less useful than keeping prices of commonly used goods stable.
As an example of where Bitcoin would be a disaster: if the amount in circulation ever fell. Say due to a consumer confidence crisis as per today, where people start hoarding. With less in circulation, it means lower wages to keep everyone employed. The thing is though - wages are extremely [sticky]( downwards. Rather than fall, unemployment rises. This can be seen in the [US today]( and in Greece/Spain where unemployment is &gt;25%, and virtually everywhere else in crisis.
If you have your own currency you can mute that effect a whole heap. Keep employment high. If you're using a fixed quantity currency - you cannot. You instead end up with a "money shortage" crisis, like in the embattled Euro nations today. An entirely artificial crisis, one come about by a poor selection of monetary system.
Worse still, is it means trade deficits are a draining of wealth from one nation to another. It means the US trade deficits would result in unemployment in America. Under the Fed, this needs not occur. Under Bitcoin we'd have no choice.
Additionally - inflation is a real concern. If China pulled the stunt they did over the past couple of decades under a US using Bitcoin - that is, printing currency, selling exports to buy and hoard the currency - the US would have suffered unemployment as China acquired Bitcoin through attractively priced imports. Nearly as bad, when those Bitcoin inevitably come back from China - there'd be high inflation. Under the Fed, there need not be. It has powerful tools at its disposal to remove excess funds, under Bitcoin we only have government taxes. Not good.
So no. It's not a good foundation for a country's economy at all.
**tldr**: Keeping unemployment down would be a real problem under Bitcoin due to the downwards stickiness of wages, and price stability may be an issue too.

Once again "as long as somebody else is willing to run a deficit of $100, I can run a surplus of $100".
You're saying that as long as you can find someone that *doesn't want* to save dollars, that wants to save other assets, that you'll be able to save dollars. That's all well and good, but it doesn't change a thing.
**If** dollars are the things we want to save, and **if** we are successful at saving dollars, than someone **not us** has accrued a lot of debt or otherwise dissaved dollars.
It's why in recessions the deficit always blows out the wazoo. Demand for dollars as savings goes up, we hold on to them with every ounce of strength we can, we collectively have a lot more control over our own budgets than the government does of its (largely determined by automatic stabilizers/taxes that vary with spending in the economy etc) and the government ends up in deficit. Funding our surplus.
Bitcoin doesn't really change this. If we all decide to save Bitcoin at once, then whoever has the weakest control over their budgets will end up in deficit. You see the same in the Eurozone btw: everyone wants to save Euros, so nations with the least control over their budgets (be it tax avoidance, comparatively weak export sectors etc) end up in huge Euro-denominated deficits. All such that other nations can have Euro-denominated surpluses.
So for your next reply, please answer, what happens if the asset we're trying to save is specifically money, the topic of the conversation?

As long as the government levies taxes in the currency it issues, its currency will have worth.
As long as its currency has worth, government employees will be happy accepting it as payment, as they know they'll be able to trade with the private sector for goods/services.
At that, I take a tax-based view of fiat currency. This holds up in reality - [all dominant currencies]( have been government issued, and when those government's stopped issuing them we returned to bartering - not to coins. Additionally currencies were spread to Africa not by convincing the locals that they were backed by precious metals, but by imposing penalties if their [hut taxes]( were not paid.
At that, I cannot agree with these authors that believe that "any day now" the USD may be replaced. It'll always be there, and it'll always have value. As long as you need it to live freely in this country, to own land (see [land value taxes]( - not feasibly evadable), you will desire USD holdings and the government's currency will have worth. It'll likely even continue to be the dominant currency of trade, even if it's not mandated as such - as it's convenient, and you *know* it'll cover your tax obligations.

People's savings are very slow. Think retirement funds, etc. Normally these savings aren't stored as cash, but rather in things like bonds.
Those bonds, they're excluded from the money supply, and thus not counted in velocity calculations.
Recently, the Fed's made bonds largely worthless investments (by lowering interest rates, making them trade for close to their face value), and then gone on to buy trillions of dollars of them (quantitative easing). This moves savings from bonds, into what we class as "money".
Now that those savings are classed as "money", rather than "bonds" (not money), they factor into velocity calculations, and as those savings are slow moving, velocity has been falling.
**tldr**; the Fed's been making money velocity fall by effectively redefining some asset classes we normally consider "non-money" as "money", increasing the denominator of "money velocity = GDP / money supply" equation.

You said essentially: "money's currently in bonds, hence slow".
In reality, it's the other way around. Quantitative easing is the Fed buying bonds, removing them from circulation, and leaving reserves in their place. Reserves are included in virtually *all* measures on the money supply, 10yr bonds are included in virtually none. Therefore, velocity measures *decrease* post-QE, as there's now less bonds to count and more "money".

Money can't be "stored" in bonds/stock market etc.
You *buy* bonds/stock market etc, giving your money to the seller of those assets. The seller now has that money. What are they doing with it, and why is it sitting idle?
The answer I explain [here]( It's basically the opposite - the Fed's *adding* money, but it's doing it by *removing* bonds from circulation. Just as those bonds were sitting as slow moving assets, the reserves it's replaced them with are *too* slow moving assets. Now normally, we don't factor bonds in the money velocity equation, but we *do* factor in reserves, hence falling velocity post-swap (QE).

It's effectively a tax on savings that subsides debt.
When a central bank believes the economy would benefit from more spending, it lowers interest rates. This discourages saving, encourages spending - including of money you don't have (by taking on debt).
This kept the world growing well for quite some time. Whenever demand dropped, central banks would lower rates encouraging spending, and vice versa as unemployment picks up. Problem is, you hit zero percent and this usual control stops working. You now either need to go negative (and hope people don't perform bank runs), considering that on the whole taxing people of their savings (negative rates) probably isn't as encouraging for people to spend as simply paying them less money for saving (reducing positive rates), or you fiddle around with long term rates hoping to encourage spending there (QE).
This conundrum has kept this recession going on for umpteen years, but if OP is correct the ECB is considering going negative, hoping that'll bring about more spending in the economy such that more people can have jobs. I don't think it's a good solution at all, but that's the logic behind it. Discouraging saving through taxes (levied by the CB), encourage debt by subsidizing it through those same taxes.

Government fiat has value because it has a unique entirely unique to it, for which there is no substitute : it can be used to discharge taxes of the government that uses it.

Hence the whole country's willing to work for XXX, which means it dominates trade in the country.

The real constraints on a currency issuer's spending are just that - the *real* constraints.
That is, *every* gov't, no matter what currency they're spending, can only possibly buy as much as their economy can produce. It doesn't matter how much "wealth" they have, if they try to buy more steel than the economy can produce the only possible outcomes are inflation and/or shortages. Ditto for "research", for highways, for bridges, or for private goods/services. Eg, if you were to slash taxes in a highly employed economy, such that the private sector can consume more, all you'd see for it would be higher prices and/or shortages. The economy can only produce so much after all.
Thing is, gov'ts that *choose* to borrow something outside of their control bring an additional set of constraints - those of finances. They need to always be seen to be running a sustainable budget, or else they may be denied the currency they choose to operate. Exhibit: Greece, Argentina, Zimbabwe.. actually, *most* the developing nations, which the IMF (among others) readily lend more USD than they can afford to pay back. They get stuck in a debt trap all too familiar to many currency-*users*.
So because of financial constraints, you end up with government's leaving their economies partially unemployed to ensure that they don't run out of "*money*". This is not something a currency-*issuer* ever has to do, although admittedly some do it voluntarily due to misguided notions the public/politicians have on debt.. eg the UK post GFC (where the leaving party had ["used up all the pounds"]( such that the new gov't ["has to be frugal"]( - they don't, but we apparently don't know any better - and it's all lead to sadly all-too-predictable outcomes - see my made-in-paint graph [here](


When someone spends more than they've earnt - eg taken on debt - another has received more than they've spent. One person dissaving has lead to another person saving.
That's literally how money comes to be. Just think of money as a ledger of who owes who what, and you won't be far off. If someone spends money they don't have, they *owe* work, eg, are in debt.
The act of borrowing money literally creates it. Contrary to the popular sentiment that banks are in the business of "loaning out savings", they're actually in the business of *creating* money by issuing loans, and those loans ultimately end up being saved by others. That is, it works backwards. You "saving" doesn't allow for others to borrow, rather others borrowing money into existence has allowed you to save. How else could it even work?
For more on that, see [here]( and for more in depth the BoE paper it cites [here]( (PDF warning).


The dollars you are saving were created when another took on debt. Someone, somewhere, spent more than they earnt such that you can earn more than you're spending, saving the difference under your mattress.


If you set your own interest rate on debt, and your own credit limit, why would you ever insist on paying that debt down?
Think about it. The reason households do is primarily so they can retire. They also don't set their own interest rates, so they can't keep rolling it over lest they'll hit their lender-imposed credit limit. Currency-issuers however *do* set their own rates, they can set those rates to be real negative or below, and they set their own credit limits, *and* they don't retire. They persist through generations. So why would they pay it all back? And when? Why that date, and not another?
No. Currency-issuers ought simply run whatever budgets are conducive with full employment without being so expansionary as to be inflationary. There's no need for them to pay back the debt by any specific date, and so if doing so would put people out of the job and not improve price stability, they really oughtn't do it. There's a good (but long) parable [here]( that may assist you on that.


@_date: 2015-02-23 07:55:45
Except money owed does equal money saved by others. Yes, not all this is represented by physical money, but only because we've invented bank ledgers such that that's not necessary.

It sounds like you want to reject MMT on the grounds that it doesn't fit with how you want the world to be. You have to be very careful not to do that - I'm sure you're aware it's not at all logical to do so. But grats on acknowledging that it's a factor :)
The thing is. We have a state. We have a state that taxes in a specific currency. MMT simply argues that that being the case, the state can cause job losses by taxing too highly. Mosler likes to argue that you don't have unemployment in barter economies, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's right. The moment that you have a monetary economy though, with a gov't imposing taxes on people, you have to be careful not to allow those pieces of paper flowing through the economy to seize up the system.. as has been the case the last few years.


You'll note that MMT downplays monetary policy with many arguing that rates should be at real 0% or nominal 0% all the time, and that we largely get rid of central bankers. They argue that monetary policy has unclear effects on demand (thanks to the interest income channel), and that it's ineffective at the ZLB anyway.
What they generally prefer is fiscal policy, with far stronger automatic stabilizers and what they call a price anchor (in a [job guarantee]( doing the heavy lifting on demand management/price stability instead. This doesn't require nearly as much micromanagement - as demand increases, they automatically cut back, and vice versa.


He's not getting it. He starts with "redenomination of everything won't change anything, therefore you're arguing to redenominate *currency*, but not contracts". In reality, MMT is not arguing for a redenomination. It's arguing for *tax cuts*, leaving people with more money to spend and save.
It's just, should people decide to save more currency, there's literally less money to go around. It's a drain on the economy. To maintain spending at a level equal to whatever employment was before, you're going to need to reduce taxes and/or have the gov't spend more. That's all. There's nothing about redenominating currency whilst keeping contracts the same or anything like that (1hr22min in if you want to watch again).


How does lowering taxes benefit debtors more than savers?
The *only* reason the existing budget is no longer enough is because of savers. In fact, if no one was ever willing to "save" dollars over the course of a year, the govt's budget would always end up balanced. It's only because there's people putting aside USD that's leading to deficits in the system. And if the gov't fights those deficits via austerity, you'll just end up with unemployment/waste. Exhibit: the EU.


The value of a government's currency is determined primarily by the price the gov't pays when it makes purchases and how it values assets that it loans its currency against, along with taxation measures to ensure that demand doesn't push prices above what the govt's willing to pay. Nothing changes with Bitcoin there. If people were to decide they no longer want to hold more than a minimal amount of USD, the budget would end up balanced, but nothing else really changes.


This may make you feel better: MMT doesn't care a great deal for competing currencies. You're free to have them, just the gov't mustn't accept them as payment for taxes. Canada's already like this (two parties can settle transactions however they wish - USD is readily used in border towns), evidence that MMT's right, and that fiat isn't dependant on "legal tender" laws for currencies to have value. People still like hold CAD, even in border towns, as they need it for taxes (and so it's the most widely accepted currency in the nation accordingly).


Sure, but now you're paying people to provide you with the service of holding USD for you until tax time. You haven't escaped USD - you've just offloaded the duty of holding it. Come tax time, you get the USD you need, they get their cut for providing that service, and the tax man remains happy.


Nope. There's no sure bets in finance, and I really would have thought this sub would have figured that out by now.
Quick proof of this: if you *knew*, 100% sure bet, that bitcoin was going to be worth $1000 this time next year.. it'd already have been bid up to that price by all the investors that knew the same, less the nominal risk-free rate as set by the Fed (currently near-as-makes-no-difference 0%). That bitcoin *hasn't* been bid up to astronomical heights let's us know that it's not a sure bet that it's going to go to the moon. Nor dogecoin/litecoin or any of the other altcoins for that matter.


Being required for taxes is enough. It means there's 300mn people in the world's largest economy that are dependant on them. That means there is an unfathomably *huge* market for them.


Eh? Bitcoin therefore gold standard? Might have to explain that cognitive leap to me ;).

@_date: 2015-02-26 15:19:20
Parts are interesting. Parts of it I believe to be incorrect. Eg:


There's nothing unsustainable about a currency issuer borrowing the same free-floating currency it issues. In fact, sovereign government debt is how you *break* the seeming impossibility for people to acquire savings in a debt-based monetary system.
Think of it like this: money is created through debt. For you to acquire savings, you need another to take on debt. But if there was an entity that can acquire debt without concern for its own revenue position, it could supply us with whatever savings we need for high employment/growth.
And it turns out there is such an entity - the issuer of the currency. Currency issuers are not ever denied their own free floating currency by markets - it just cannot happen (and even if it could, the issuer could just QE some of its bonds into reserves - a non-inflationary manoeuvre anyway). Lost on the author of that article, it's for *this* reason that Japan is yet to run out of yen - because they're borrowing just that, *yen*.
The Japanese gov't is forever paying Japanese people more yen than it's taxing them, and they get to hold the difference as savings. Savings where, for once, the debt is of no real consequence (except for whatever we voluntarily impose on ourselves due to irrational fear over monetary sovereigns owing sums of their own currency - eg the sales tax rise that Japan should have never implemented).
A few notes where the author's gone wrong:


Free floating currencies keep current accounts sustainable. That the Eurozone does not have individual currencies is what is causing their system to break down.


Utter nonsense. Unsubstantiated, no supporting argument, just nonsense.


Zimbabwe/Weimar/Germany/Hungary/Argentina all had huge debts due in currencies they don't issue. They attempted to print the currency they *do* issue to pay back the debt they don't (or in Argentina's case, simply buy more USD than their economy can actually earn/support). That's never going to work.
I don't know about the rest (nor in some cases the specific incidents the author's referring to), but I would be surprised if they're not in a similar boat. 


Nonsense. Compare Greek before and after Euro [here]( Hasn't it been great?
About all the Euro's allowed Greece to do is more easily live beyond its means as a country for a **very** short period of time before those means caught up with it. If they'd had a free-floating currency, and only borrowed in terms of that currency, they would have never experienced a sovereign debt crisis.


Nonsense. And why is it always gold? Seriously, ***who cares***.


Lol. And what if gold was $1tn an ounce?
I tuned out past there. It just got incomprehensible. Went from "Debt is bad" to "therefore gold = boom". Nonsense.
Anyway. If you want me to elaborate on anything, even the rubbish at the end, let me know (my goldbug care factor is somewhere around 0 ;)

That's a misrepresentation of the MMT argument.
MMT argues that a shortage of money can lead to an economy *underperforming*. Mosler puts it best in this debate [here]( where he likens taxes to a plastic bag over a runner's head. If taxation is too high, the runner can not run as fast/is stifled, and at best we can tax at an appropriate level such that full potential is reached.
This is contrasted to "mainstream" where people seem to genuinely believe that, through debt, the gov't can somehow allow the economy to "exceed"/"go *beyond* its means", at least until it can't borrow any more. This is nonsense of course. The economy is only capable of so much, and the best we can do is ensure that the gov't isn't stifling it by taxing too highly for its level of expenditure. Money isn't going to allow us to exceed that, for money is just what we use to *facilitate* trade. It's the lubricant, as you/FOFOA say, and if the gov'ts being too stingy with it (/equivalently, taxing too highly), that trade will not be able to occur.
Essentially, answer me this. Do you believe that if the gov't massively increased taxes tomorrow, and did not alter spending, that it'd be harder to run a business? Of course you do! All MMT posits is that perhaps the rate of taxation most conducive for high level of employment *may not be equal to that of a balanced budget*. I mean, what evidence do you/mr FOFOA have that a balanced budget *is* an appropriate budget for the times? How do you know that the level of taxation required to bring one in wouldn't stifle production?
If there's anything I've missed, do let me know. I will point out that FOFOA does not seem to recognise that Weimar/Zimbabwe tanked their currencies by buying foreign currencies, and conflates a gov't buying its own bonds w/ a gov't buying real assets with "printed money" as if these two operations are identical - when they couldn't be further apart in effect. The latter, Zimbabwe, was a gov't trying to buy more than an economy can produce (=inflation), the former is just an asset swap (Japan/USA). FOFOA really needs to acknowledge that these two operations aren't remotely the same (I feel he may have an ulterior motive there in trying to pass them off as equal - probably owns a lot of gold).

You're aware that the risk-free rate in real terms has been overwhelmingly positive throughout the dollar's history right?
That is, if you have dollars, you've been able to acquire *more wealth*, in real terms, without having to do any work or take any risk yourself. You need merely leave them in US govt bonds/notes and/or in an interest paying bank account. You can't ask for much more than that.

Money's *not* a shared delusion, it's not entirely circular like that. That they dominate trade certainly adds to their value, but people would value them even if they didn't as they're *the only* things in the world that can discharge taxes.
Just think of Canada. In Canada, nobody's required to accept the CAD - any two parties can settle transactions however the wish. However taxes must be paid in CAD. This leads to many border towns that'll readily accept USD.. but guess what. The CAD still dominates, and it's not because Canadians are entirely deluded. It's because possessing CAD is a necessary requirement to be able to function in Canada. There's nothing "delusional" about it - it's just cold hard reality.

Nothing. Nothing would happen, as the govt would be removing one dollar worth of assets (in bonds) for every dollar it prints.
Think of bonds as a nominally risk-free sidechain of USD. Anyone can convert USD in to bonds to earn interest, and anyone can convert back.
The price of this conversion is set by the Federal Reserve, the ratios are set by us.
There's many other ways risk-free interest can be paid though, for instance the Fed since 2008 has set up *another* sidechain, called interest on excess reserves. So you can earn riskfree interest on USD by converting to bonds, or pretty much the same amount by simply keeping the dollars in savings.
If we pay back the debt by "printing", we just delete the bond sidechain. All those dollars get moved in to excess reserves instead.
Thing is, those two forms of savings are compatible. They both represent people that could not find better opportunities to invest, that accepted (or were forced to accept) the riskfree rate. There's no reason to think that the bond sidechain reduces spending in the economy any more than the IOER sidechain. And if they're not different, closing the former sidechain does nothing much at all.

And meanwhile an equivalent chart of the holdings of bonds will have had an equal and opposite dive.
We "lost" a few trillion dollars worth of bonds, we "gained" a few trillion dollars worth of reserves. It's like having the bank tell you that it's moved money out of your savings account, that was earning 0.1% interest, and into your check account, where it'll now earn 0% interest. Your wealth hasn't increased, you're getting ever-so-slightly less interest, but suddenly you get hysterical because when you look at a graph of money in your checking account you see a spike - clearly your bank's printing money! Clearly money's soon going to be worthless!
Again, nonsense. QE (swapping bonds for their market value in reserves) is not inflationary. If it was, the US wouldn't have experienced a period of recent-record-low inflation whilst "trillions" were being "printed", and Japan, the first QEr, wouldn't have been stuck in a trap for a decade+ by now.

If the US *had already issued* $22tn in bits of paper - call them USB - and they were worth and traded for $22tn worth of USD already, then swapping those USB for an equal value of USD would not be inflationary. *Please* explain the mechanism behind which it could be.
I mean, what if the issuer had dozens of names of the pieces of paper it issues (the US govt literally does!). Why would swapping these assets already released cause problems? By which mechanism?
The Bolivar examples do not work. They are not the govts turning past deficits in to USD, but rather running a new deficit the year or printing to purchase new stuff. Whole different kettle of fish.
To clarify, the US govt has already run the deficits. It's already spent more than it's taxed, it's already bought the stuff. You're arguing changing those from bond funded to reserve funded would change things, somehow. Why? How?

Because the question is *why* do we value it.
Saying "I value it because it has value" just isn't good enough. It's an incomplete answer - eg other people also accept yen, so why do we use USD? You may naively say "because you're required to" - but that doesn't hold up then in Canada. There has to be an answer, and that answer is the one I've given. Because government fiat has a unique use to it, for which there is no substitute.

I have two questions, as simple as they come:
1. Do you believe Bank of America could borrow USD cheaper than the US government?
2. Who sets the price of money to big banks?
The second is obvious (the Fed), so just focus on Q1. Actually, I'll break it down for you.
If Bank of America *could* borrow USD cheaper (at the price of USD as set by the Fed) than the US government, there's arbitrage to be had. Borrow that money, lend it to the issuer - the issuer that constitutionally cannot default, and has the means not to. Zero arbitrage is when banks _cannot_ borrow money cheaper than the government.
This fits the reality we see perfectly. It's why the Japanese government can still borrow yen cheaper than anyone else - because otherwise, there'd be nominally risk-free profit to be made. It's why no country has ever run in to problems borrowing its own free-floating currency.
Note: they don't even need to "print money" here. The issuer can just print bonds, as they're guaranteed to sell for a high price in terms of that government's own currency.


You can't start with "assume the bond market needs easing" - my whole point is you can't get in to that situation in the first place. Exhibit Japan/UK/US etc etc.
Remember, free-floating currencies are _new_. Before the 80s, nobody really used them. Heck, the UK wasn't on one until near year 2000. Most of what you know is antiquated, dangerous, knowledge from days of fixed exchange rates and governments borrowing assets outside of their control.

Gold has one major difference too - by choosing the gold standard, you're effectively creating an open-ended buy order for labor at a wage equal to the rate at which they can mine gold.
By doing this inflation is capped by the limited supply of gold, but deflation is capped by the ability to panhandle for gold. When spending starts falling (due to gold as an investment), real wages start falling and unemployment starts rising, panhandling takes off. People rush to gold towns to resolve the spending shortage. It has built in inflation, deflation and employment controls.
(This incidentally wouldn't work so well today, as gold is mined more by capital than labor these days - but back in the day, it worked well - surpluses of labor lead to more mining lead to more money lead to more employment/less mining, etc).
Bitcoin has no such mechanism in place. Unlike the gold standard there's no way that people can convert time into BTC at a relatively fixed rate, and as a result it's quite unsuitable to try and run an economy off. If it had that fixed rate mine, labor wages would be relatively steady (ie skilled labor may trade at twice the fixed labor-mine rate), prices would be steady, and money-shortages (ie unemployment) would never present. But it does not, so you have to put up with massive volatility instead.

The govt has *already printed* $22tn worth of bonds.
It conjured those financial assets from thin air, and used them to buy things. Goods, services - they competed in the real marketplace, affecting employment and having the capability to bid up prices.
If the govt printed $1mn in bonds and gave them to you, you'd be every bit as happy as if they printed $1mn in reserves and gave it to you. You'd be able to buy a $1mn yacht either way, it is and was real financial wealth, already created.
What we're now talking about is removing the former, and replacing them with the latter. An asset *swap*. One that doesn't make anyone wealthier, doesn't increase anyone's buying power, only (ever so slightly) changes the liquidity. And it is slight, as banks already manage the exchange seamlessly on your behalf as you need it.

There's no numerical limit on debt outstanding.
There *is* a limit on how much is actually for sale in USD. If the govt tries to buy more than is for sale (or allows the private sector to try, eg by halving cutting taxes), hyperinflation may result.
Similarly, things going unbought represents wasted opportunities. Doubling taxes tomorrow would hemmorhage sales and force a lot of people out of work, so the govt really should not do that.
What should be aimed for is the middle ground. Aggregate spending in the economy such that selling stuff (including labor) is easy, but not so easy as to lead to the currency rapidly depreciating.
What's debt then? Just the aggregate sum of past deficits/surpluses. As issuer of the USD, govt need worry about it no more than the Japanese govt needs to worry about how much yen it owes. It cannot run out, despite that it could still make bad decisions with that power.

I'd say M3 isn't terribly useful if prices are what concern you.
See, government bonds don't change M3 in the slightest. Yet deficits can be very inflationary - after all, the bonds created in deficit spending are extremely liquid assets that can be exchange to/from money very easily. The government creates an asset - a bond - sells it at auction, and the buyers of that bond can convert it to/from money at will, whenever they need to spend. M3 doesn't cover that, yet those bonds represent real purchasing power to their owners. At that, L is far more relevant.
L also doesn't change with QE, hence the negligible inflation we see today despite the large changes in M3.

There's a huge amount of idle labor at the moment that could be providing more goods/services for us to consume, yet you believe we can't allow them to - why? Why do we need to leave this labor idle? Why do we need to lower consumption in a time where we have so much capacity to produce more?
When you think of "real economic resources", today we're leaving more idle than we have for many years - yet you see this as necessary. That because during the boom time people were able to find jobs delivering 50lb bags of dog food, they can't today.. for some reason. Perhaps because we've run out USD or something.
To me this is simply a crisis of insufficient spending to employ all willing labor. It's effectively a money shortage, like what's going on in the Euro zone but not as bad. The thing is - with fiat money, you don't need a money shortage to present everytime people begin to pay back debt.
If you merely allow the government to supply the money everyone needs to pay back debt through deficit spending no shortage need present. If people want to have positive net savings - just let them have it, so be it, provide them this through deficits. If they want to go on a debt binge - ok, that's when the government ought back off and possibly even run surpluses. But it makes no sense for the government to back off before that point. It'd then just be manufacturing a shortage of a man-made resource, of money. A shortage of a resource we have invented leading to real resources such as labor going idle unnecessarily. Permanent loss of potential man-hours of labor, consumption and investment we'll never get back. *That* is real economic wastage. Those hours of labor have been lost to us forever, as have the skills they would have created, the work ethics, and along with the poverty this creates comes additional problems such as crime. It's a mess, and all because of a shortage of spending.


I agree that doubling all nominal values would not change anything.
What about instead though, looking at those people currently unemployed that cannot register any demand in the economy - and giving them a wage. They can then spend that wage demanding essential goods and services that the private sector can easily expand to produce. The result of this would be a larger private sector producing more goods than before.
Remember, you only get inflation if the total amount being spent on transactions is increasing *faster* than output. If you clone America so that now you have two, you have twice as much money but you also have twice the output - no inflation has occurred. The same applies if I demand beer from a brewery that has excess capacity - no inflation need occur. That brewery just hires more workers from the massive stock of labor, the unemployed, and prices need not rise, only output. The whole point is that today there's ample capacity to produce more - but with spending not increasing, labor remains idle.


All evidence points to wages being incredibly sticky downwards. You can see it [here]( and even in this AskReddit post [here]( Humans just aren't happy to work for a fraction of what they used to the moment spending dries up. That long term adjustment period is unnecessary in fiat money - we can and ought to make wages relatively steady and have the price of goods/services scale around them. This suits human nature far better than having the quantity of money fixed and having our wages and contracts volatile in price.
Not just that though - there's nothing that says the market clearing level today would be at all close to a living wage. If we manage to make the market clear but that clearing rate isn't useful for anything, we haven't solved the issue - just masked the problem. We want the market to clear at a rate that people can afford the essential goods/services they need to get by - if spending in the economy is insufficient for that, it needs to be be increased (my solution). Not each wage payment reduced (your solution).
With modern technology there's far more than enough potential output for everyone to have a living wage - the real economic resources allow for it, we just need to ensure that the man-made resource, money, does too. We can't allow a money/spending shortage to leave so many without a living wage - with or without a minimum wage. All that said, personally I'm for the abolishment of the minimum wage - but it's no nirvana. It wouldn't solve the spending crisis we have today - the symptoms would just present differently - namely in working poverty.


I'd wager that if jobs weren't so scarce right now fewer would be looking at cheating the system.

Woahhh hold on a second there.
The total transaction volume does not at all determine the price of a Bitcoin, or its "market cap".
If people are using Bitcoin to transfer fiat, every single buy order of Bitcoin (bidding up the price) is negated by the sell order at the other end of the transaction, bidding down the price. I buy 1 bitcoin for $20, send it to you, you sell that Bitcoin for $20. Your sell order counteracts my buy order, it ought be price neutral.
What actually holds the price up is a lot of people buy Bitcoin without later selling, holding onto it in the middle - those users (cynics would say speculators) are a far larger determinant of the market cap than the number of people merely transferring fiat through Bitcoin.

The jobs digging holes don't, no. But those workers receiving a wage can create demand in the private sector where they could not before, demand for new goods/services.
Quite simply, the private sector will not grow to meet demand if it is not registered by people trying to buy things - it simply will not grow to meet the desires of a bunch of homeless/jobless people, no matter how much they desire goods and services. Give those people a job though, a wage, and the private sector can grow to meet their demands. If you want to grow the private sector the most important thing to do is ensure that everyone that wants a job can find one.
Also, economics is no zero sum game - that's simple econs 101. Give homeless/jobless people a wage to employ the private sector with and everyone benefits.


For this, you're going to have to explain your issue with public sector debt. Is it that you believe it'll lead to a currency collapse, or that one day the government will run into problems issuing new debt. Because I reject the latter - the currency-issuer will never have difficulty finding someone willing to lend it the currency it issues. There is no safer loan one can make in the currency, and accordingly interest rates on government debt will always be low, irrespective of how much debt it has outstanding.


To deleverage you need to accrue financial assets. Deficits, be them funded by new bonds or new cash, both serve this purpose - they both bolster banking reserves, both bolster your savings.
The Fed is not increasing our financial assets through QE, it's merely performing an asset swap. It makes no one richer for doing so. If I own a million dollars worth of bonds I'm no worse off than someone owning a million dollars in cash - and swapping the former for the latter is no form of deleveraging.
For the non-public sector to deleverage en masse, that is, for the non-public sector to run a surplus (put aside savings), you need public sector deficits, for the public sector deficit = the non-public sector surplus.


Why do you see the government printing pieces of high-valued paper in the form of bonds as inherently different to printing cash?
I mean really, please explain to me the difference in no unclear terms. Why do you believe that printing bonds - pieces of paper that trade for pretty much their face value - to be not overly inflationary, but printing cash - pieces of paper that trade for exactly their face value - extremely inflationary? What's the difference?
To me, what matters when it comes to inflation is the buying power of individuals. If we're funding our deficits with new cash or new bonds - the buying power of individuals is increased by the same amount. Both ways, a $1tn deficit is funded by $1tn worth of new financial assets. Why do you see them as inherently different though? Why is adding $1tn to the private sector in very liquid assets in the form of bonds less inflationary than adding $1tn in very liquid cash? Because that's what you're claiming - that the latter is inflationary, but the former not - *why*?

They surely wouldn't be loaning it to anyone else if they're not to the government.. so are they just predicting a total collapse of the currency the moment interest exceeds revenue? That doesn't seem likely to me.

Once again, interest rates can't shoot up short of a complete collapse of the yen.
Stop thinking of a currency-issuing government as a business - if you issue the currency, lenders care not what your debt position is at, for it has no impact on whether your bonds will be paid when they fall due or not. Lenders know they'll always be paid back in full, so you always get the cheapest possible lending. It doesn't matter that the books make not a lick of sense, bonds will always sell for high prices - and you don't even have a counter example.
No free-floating currency issuing government has ever run into any problems issuing debt denominated in that currency. Japan's testing this more than any other and yet they get the world's cheapest lending, as ought be expected when the outlook on the central bank lifting rates over the term of the loan is zero. There just isn't a counter-example - bond markets have never moved unfavourably against a nation with all debt denominated in the free-floating currency they issue. What you're describing, what you believe will happen, is completely unprecedented.


That's completely incorrect. The government creates and sell bonds to **spend**.
Work it through.
First up, the non-government has $10tn in net financial assets. The government wants to run a $1tn deficit. So it prints $1tn worth of bonds, sells them at auction, and spends the money it raises. The non-government has purchased the $1tn of bonds **and** received back the money the government has spent. After the $1tn deficit, the non-government is $1tn richer. They have the same $10tn in net financial assets they used to, but now they have an **additional** $1tn in the form of newly printed bonds.
If the Fed comes along and swaps those $1tn of bonds for $1tn of cash, the net financial position of the non-government has not increased further. It's just changed the makeup of their NFA, their liquidity.
Your argument would only hold if the government were to sell bonds to put cash in a vault - *then*, and only then, would it be a straight swap. Bonds go out to the non-government, cash comes in, cash sits in a vault where the non-government can't touch it. Obviously this isn't what happens when the government runs a deficit - a deficit is cash comes in from bond sales, cash **and** bonds go out. Governments sell bonds to spend, do not forget that.

The Fed's ensuring that banks are loaning to one another at 0% interest, and that they will continue to do so for the forseeable future.
Why then would a bank loan to another bank for 0% interest today if it could buy a 2yr bond returning any more than that?
And looking further into the future, if expectations of Fed set interest rates on the interbank lending markets over the next 10 years is 1.5%... why would a bank not buy bonds returning 2% today?
At that bonds won't "go down precipitously" unless the market decides the Fed is going to lift rates to quite a high level, something the Fed would have to be mad to do and is completely contrary to the course of action the Fed has laid out.

$0.30 per transaction, 261k transactions/day.
Gives ~$78k/day to run the network (post-inflation period).
Costs ~$40k/day to sustain an attack against the network.
I'm still yet to comprehend how this model is intended to work post-inflation, particularly in that if the value of transactions were to go up, so too would the value gained from attacking.
It seems flawed to me, a model both dependent on inflation to work, whilst simultaneously requiring promises of "fixed supply" to give it the value it needs. I just don't see how that transition is supposed to work, it either becomes prohibitively expensive to transact, or insecure.

Which gives us an idea of how high transaction fees will have to be. To secure the network as adequately as it is today, it takes ~$20000/10 minutes. (25BTC reward, I'm being generous on BTC exchange rate).
This means that if the average transaction rate is to be 10 transactions per second (higher than the current *limit*), 6000 transactions per block, the fee will have to be $3.33 in a post block reward world.
If we want to keep low fees, say no more than 15c, the Bitcoin network will need to see an average of 222 transactions per second (20000 / 0.15 / 600), each paying 15c.
We could of course allow for miners to get less, but this will mean a less secure network. Ideally, a larger network would be *more* secure than today's, so we should probably multiply those figures by 10. That is, $33.33 fees for 10tps, or 2222tps @ 15c. The latter is a low-ball approximate, as it assumes that processing transactions have zero real cost to miners, ignoring any storage/processing overhead of processing that many transactions.

A better question, is how can anyone expect them to know what the interest rate "should" be ahead of time?
That is, the moment they choose a currency to tax in, they're somewhat locking it in as the dominant currency of trade (see Canadian Dollars - no one's obligated to accept them or pay wages in them, but seeing as taxes *must be* paid in them they dominate in Canada).
Now real interest rates are determined largely by what you decide to call "money". If you choose Bitcoin, a fixed money supply, you'll see completely different real interest rates in the economy than if you choose a cryptocurrency that grows at 2% per year, than if you choose gold, than if you choose Freicoin, than if you choose a cryptocurrency that deliberately destroys coins (ie half the transaction fee is destroyed) or "oil-backed money" than if you choose a cryptocurrency that recycles lost coins etc. Yet you/others are asking these interest rates to be locked in ahead of time - how can anyone claim to know which would yield the best results?
Would a 2% growing money supply function better than 0% one? Would a 3% be better than that? Would tieing it to the rate at which we can extract an arbitrary resource, gold perhaps, be better? What about a deflationary resource, like oil? What about silicon? Which should we choose to call "money", and why?

If you don't differentiate that you're not talking about the conventional definition, anyone who's taken Economics 101 would take "hyperinflation" to mean a rapidly rising price level - as would many that haven't.
Clearly, Bitcoin cannot experience monetary supply hyperinflation, but it could certainly experience price level hyperinflation (ie the standard use of the word).
The statement in Wikipedia's opening paragraph that you quote really should not be there - if you read down the page you can see that money supply is only *one* theoretical cause of hyperinflation, a severe supply side shock is another.
Any output collapse of an economy would lead to hyperinflation without a rapid withdrawal of money, and for Bitcoin, as would a loss of faith in Bitcoin being *the* cryptocurrency to use.

On what do you base this assertion?


A completely fixed money supply would make for a horrible monetary system to run an economy off. Bitcoin has a place in this world, but it's not as the foundation of a country's economy.
I go into it in more detail [here]( but essentially high real interest rates mean low level of spending. Low level of spending means a low level of income and fewer jobs. What's the real rate of interest on Bitcoin today? Look to the exchange rate chart over the past year - extreme.
Quite simply, very few businesses could not possibly hope to be able to get high enough returns denominated in Bitcoin to repay *any* loans, meaning investment would plummet. Even spending money - most businesses would find they make more real profit by simply hoarding cash than trying to do business. So why would they do the latter? Same story with consumers. Nobody could hope to borrow for a mortgage - nor would they be willing to spend but a fraction of their savings on essentials.
Not just that, but think about it in the first few years - how would they acquire the Bitcoin they all now require for taxes? By exporting to the rest of the world. Instead of simply being self-dependent, they now depend on the rest of the world to acquire the Bitcoins they've decided to base their economy off.
Imagine if we did something similar - imagine if the Swedes had a natural resource that no one else had, and we decided that we were going to base our currency off it on the grounds that it is limited in supply. That puts us at a massive disadvantage - and Swedes in great power. We need to supply them with exports to acquire this currency to operate, they don't need to do anything other than supply us with this resource that they don't even use themselves for much. Our country's quite at their mercy, how much they decide to sell that resource for etc. I see Bitcoin as little different here to a place like Nauru. They'd be at the complete mercy of early adopters, early adopters (/speculators/hoarders) in a position of great power over their whole economy. Why would they subject themselves to this?
The gold standard had a lot of similar issues to the above - but there in the early days country's tended to simply invade country's that had a lot of this resource they'd decided to call "money" and seize it - this is not an option available for Nauru. They'll have to acquire the Bitcoins they need to operate solely by exporting, that is, their people providing real goods and services just to ship their efforts off-shore so that they can acquire the thing they call "money".. that's their choice of monetary system imposing a *massive* cost on their economy and for what? What appreciable gains?

If I have $1mil worth of bonds I can bid up the price of goods very nearly as easily as if I have $1mil of cash.
I may need to sell them first to do so, but no matter - there's always a willing buyer available for they are *very liquid assets*. That buyer loses no buying power for holding these effectively zero interest bonds - he too can swap them for cash at a later date should he choose to bid up market prices like I have today.
Bonds are not the deflationary "hold on cash" we pretend them be. Printing very liquid high value assets in the form of bonds is little different to printing cash when it comes to the inflationary impact of the governments spending - the only real difference is that without interest being paid on reserves by the Fed the latter would allow for more loaning. Now that interest is being paid on reserves even that isn't a problem should we want to lift rates in the future.

It is true that it could be anyone in the non-public sector, including foreigners, that's saving in yen. For much of the debt increasing period though Japan was actually running a trade *surplus* as foreign reserve banks [decreased]( their holdings of yen. This has turned around to a deficit now as foreign central banks are increasing their holdings, I'll give you that. My point in general though was that public sector deficits are merely the non-public sector saving in yen, be it the private or foreign sector, this is what is happening today.
I personally don't think we'll see yen inflation until the economy's closer to capacity. Japan is hugely [underemployed]( hence the stagnant GDP - inflation isn't going to turn around until that decreases, and then there's no reason to expect that inflation to be any worse than the couple of percent any other nation sees.

The prime determinant over what loans are made in the economy is real interest rates.
Real = nominal (what you charge) + the rate of deflation.
The latter is outside of anyone's control with Bitcoin, and the former cannot go below zero or you'd be better off simply keeping off your Bitcoins in your wallet.
Compare this to today, where the Fed today has made the risk-free interest rate *real negative*. It's still not enough to encite sufficient loaning to keep the economy fully employed, but it's something you can only see under an inflationary currency. Under a deflationary currency the risk-free rate would always be at least the negative of the rate of deflation, and if that's high you'll see low levels of loaning and spending, potentially far lower than the economy could support leaving people and capital unemployed.

High enough to overcome our savings desire and go on to reach full employment. If it's not deficit spending enough, our savings desires are unmet and the paradox of thrift sets in ensuring that some go without any savings/jobs whatsoever. Best explained in this parable [here](
A [job guarantee]( is one theoretical approach at finding that level of deficit spending automatically.


Households and businesses are deleveraging faster than ever before. The government is providing the savings they're using to do so via its deficit spend, but it's proving not sufficient to provide us with enough to both deleverage and spend at the same time. So some have reduced spending in their attempts to deleverage, this can be resolved by simply deficit spending more.


You still don't understand. The Fed has been trying to cause inflation, but it just doesn't have the tools for the job. An asset swap is not inflationary - it's replacing a piece of paper worth $1000 with cash worth $1000. It just does not achieve anything meaningful.
The holder of that piece of paper could have spent money consuming if they so desired to, but they did not, they wanted the near zero yield bond as a value store. Replacing it with zero yield cash does pretty much nothing, if they were ok with zero yield bonds they'd be ok with zero yield cash.
There's just no point in time that these swaps will retrospectively *become* inflationary, they're a non-inflationary maneuver and always will be. The best the Fed can do is lift *expectations* by saying that it'll achieve its goals of inflation, but without actually having any tools to do this it's no better than a [scarecrow]( that the market is growing wise to.
If we want inflation, we need to actual increase spending to get it. Take our deficits too high and you'll see it, but there's a huge amount of wriggle room before we reach that point. And of course, with an inflation targeting central bank, inflation doesn't rise with too high deficits - interest rates do.


Hardly. You're just the most recent in a long line of people saying the same.. except they used to be talking about last decade. Every single person that's ever taken the [widow maker bet]( has come up worse off - think you'll put your money where your mouth is this decade?

Gold is more feasible to run an economy off than Bitcoin.
Under the gold standard the currency is pegged at the amount of time it takes to mine a unit of gold, with all prices scaling around that. If a money/spending shortage presents, more people run to the hills and mine - more money is created, and the shortage resolves itself.
Under Bitcoin, the total supply is fixed. Prices deflate, the real rate of interest will tend to be positive which could well lead to crisis's of insufficient spending - only now there's no recourse. People can't mine more Bitcoin when the spending crisis presents, we instead need to wait for internal devaluation to reach the point that people are willing to spend again - internal devaluation being the [extremely painful]( process that Greece/Spain is currently going through.
So whilst Bitcoin certainly has its niche, I'd really hate to see an economy built around it. The damage a crisis of spending can do is not to be understated, and in Bitcoin that crisis is likely to be more severe than under any other monetary system.

It's not an IOU of $100, but $100 worth of IOUs.
Bonds are literally printed until the whole value of the deficit has been raised. The market at that point is indifferent as to which of the two options they take.
Further, unless these are koningbucks, it's very different again. The govt cannot run out of USD. You can.
That makes your IOUs look like those of Greece or a householder. They're for something you have little to no jurisdiction over.
Meanwhile, the US govt created the USD, it created the body within itself that manages it, giving it all the tools to ensure that it can fulfill its constitutional requirement to never default. And because it can never be forced to default, it can find itself a shortage of lenders for the nominally risk free interest it provides.

Why are people happy to sit on ~zero yield bonds, but not happy to sit on zero yield cash?
Why does swapping those bonds for cash suddenly motivate them to chase returns? Because that's what you're claiming - that if we replace a zero yield high value asset with the cash equivalent, investors will suddenly get motivated to chase yields where they did not before. Why?


You don't even need to use them as collateral. You can simply sell your zero yield bonds and chase gold/stocks/what-have-you with cash without taking any risk yourself. But for some reason, prior the QE, you were content not doing this. You were content sitting on your bonds that are returning negligable interest. You weren't selling them, you weren't borrowing against them - you were merely using them as a safe store of wealth.
What you're claiming though is that if the Fed were to come along and replace those bonds with cash that return literally zero interest, suddenly you'd be motivated to chase gold/stocks/what-have-you. Why? What changed? Why did you go from being someone content with just storing wealth in ~zero yield bonds to someone suddenly seeking risky returns? Doesn't sitting on zero yield cash better fit your profile?


There is. Bernanke thinks he can create inflation expectations - everyone knows he's printing "billions". Thing is though, that trick only works until the markets grow wise to the fact that what he's doing is not actually inflationary. Every round suffers diminishing returns - at that, I would bet against you, that QE will be revealed to be non-inflationary. It'll be revealed that when in a liquidity trap, we may as well fund our deficits with cash over bonds - there's no real difference. Time will tell I guess.

Only at the moment, due to low use. I don't really think this should be touted as a benefit of Bitcoin.
You need to pay enough to reserve you space in just 1mb block of data mined at a fixed rate - if Bitcoin ever sees real use, this fee will become non-trivial. Small transactions will become non-viable.
That's *good* though, as every block needs to reward at least a few thousand dollars to cover the power requirements of a strong network - ideally going into the future (to pay for a network large enough to be completely adversary proof), tens of thousands. As the reward falls off, this needs to be raised entirely by the transaction fees in the block - if they only paid enough for a small network, Bitcoin would not be secure.

You're assuming there that banks loan reserves, that the money multiplier theory as taught is a decent representation of reality.
The thing is though - when you have a central bank targeting interest rates on the interbank lending markets, it does *not* apply at all for well-capitalised banks. Any well capitalised bank can simply look at that interbank lending rate, mark it up, and on-sell it to customers. As long as they maintain their credit worthiness by only loaning to credit-worthy customers the only limit to how much money they can create in this fashion is how many credit-worthy customers they can find, they are never limited by their own reserves.
This is backed up by theory ([MMT]( and recent papers (2010) published by central bankers themselves. ie here's the [Bank of International Settlements]( on the theory that banks loan out reserves:


And here's [the Fed]( on the same:


response of bank loans to monetary policy seem to
be driven by demand fact
Accordingly, interest rates play the far larger role in determining how many loans than reserves, something the money multiplier theory misses completely. It's interest rates that determine how many customers they can find and therefore how many loans they can issue, not reserves.
Importantly whilst we historically use bonds to soak up excess reserves and establish a floor interest rate, it's not the only way. We can simply pay interest on reserves, as the Fed now does. ie if the Fed wants to ensure that no loans go out for less than 10% interest, it can simply pay 10% interest on excess reserves. No bank in their right mind would loan to a customer for less than 10% interest if they could get more by simply leaving their excess reserves as excess reserves, accordingly a floor rate of interest has been established *despite* excess reserves. That is, we don't *need* to keep excess reserves at zero as we have historically done. It's one way of implementing monetary policy, one way of establishing interest rates - but it's not the only way.

There's price fixing, which is the government mandating that things be sold for certain prices. This causes either surpluses or shortages. You can attempt to apply as many different price fixes on as many different goods/services as you like, with each control causing a lot of problems. This is what you're thinking of, but it bears no resemblance to monetary policy.
Monetary policy is altering the supply of money such that X sells for Y. You can only do this for one good or basket of goods at a time. Every other price will scale around it, so you choose one good or basket of goods that makes for a smooth running economy.
Under the gold standard we decided this good ought be gold. So we altered the money supply that gold was fixed in price, with every other price in the economy scaling around it.
Today we target a basket of common goods/services. We alter the money supply such that this basket rises in price by 2-3% per year, and every other price scales around this basket. This makes running businesses considerably more efficient than a volatile currency - you'll note nearly all Bitcoin vendors price in USD because doing so shields them from the volatility of Bitcoin. It works well for labor - we get to get continuous raises, far better for morale then a different paycheck each week - and it works well for long-term  contracts. Prices are predictible, a useful quality.

So gold has been traditionally chosen. Something that inflates very slowly - wages were similar at the start of the 1800s to towards the end.
You've now looked at that, gone "that was good", and concluded that a fixed supply, which would have lead to wage deflation over the period, would be even better. This is where I'm calling you out on it - you're drawing conclusions from a model of relative price stability and saying *therefore* a price deflationary model would be just as good. Or maybe even better.
Yet under a price stable model, real interest rates can be very low - approaching 0% even. Under a deflationary model, real interest rates would at all times be higher. They'd yield two very different amounts of spending, and if *one*, the gold standard, would lead to high employment - why would the very different model of deflation also lead to high employment?
To me, it seems you have nothing to back this theory but ideology and a *longing* for it to be the case. Nothing substantiative. Yet supporting evidence, or at least a well worked theory, is what I would need if I were to ever believe that Bitcoin would make for a strong economy.

Regardless. Back to the original topic: the only difference to the net financial assets of the non-public is *not* the amount of bonds the Fed holds, but rather the difference in value the ones we continue to hold have because of QE. Agreed?
Because this is a substantially smaller number than the total number of dollars "printed". Which again, is the difference between mining and QE. With mining, every single Bitcoin mined enters circulation as brand new net financial assets. With QE, the dollars "printed" are met by a withdrawal of a near-equivalent amount of net financial assets, the only real impact is the difference in treasury prices *because* of that QE, a vastly smaller number.

Austrian economics seems to not care if the money supply is fixed, grows at a few percent per year (gold), or even decreases in supply every year (like Bitcoin, it is estimated that 1% of coins are lost every year). If they cannot justify or even see a difference between one choice of money supply (Bitcoin) and another (gold) it is quite hard to take them at all seriously.

The normal way to devalue ones currency is to simply buy foreign currencies. China did this for over a decade, they received a heap of USD in exchange for sending a heap of exports off shore. Argentina continues today, as do no doubt many other nations.
It's really quite pointless. You're selling foreigners a unit of your currency, below market rates, so that they can employ your people and take their produce - and all you get in exchange for your people's labor is a multiplier effect and units of their currency that you don't dare spend for fear of your protected export industry.
Anyway, that's the normal approach a currency war takes - once another nation starts trying to buy your currency in return, it just becomes a race to the bottom and everyone loses. Assuming other nations don't respond in kind, that a currency war does not take off, it definitely leads to more exports, as it's your reserve bank forcing a trade surplus with other nations.
I find these calls that QE/inflation targets of just 2% are in any way a currency war simply a media beat up. You're quite right, even if they were to bring about inflation in this manner it'd hardly help the export industry, for inflation ought increase the cost of everything - including exports. The one exception is if investors start to move away from the Yen for fear that it's no longer a good store of value, this'll result in a trade surplus and will result in exports.
So why try and aim for inflation? Because it lowers the real rate of interest. It makes spending less costly for savers, and makes loans cheaper for borrowers. That is the textbook reason for why Japan/the US is aiming for inflation, and except for expansion of investment, it has little to do with exports.

A money shortage can easily lead to *labor* sitting idle.
Look at Greece/Spain - they've opted to make money something outside of their control, and today they've simply run out of Euros. There's not enough in circulation to keep people anywhere near fully employed, and today &gt;50% of youth are unemployed as a result and there's just nothing they can do about it. Nearly everyone's working less hours than they want to, businesses are closing all over the country and people are emigrating away just to move to countries where there *are* sufficient Euros (or other currencies) in circulation to keep them fully employed.
It's all very reminiscent of what happened time and time again under the various gold and silver standards, a crisis simply of a "money shortage". A shortage of money, something we have invented, keeping the real factors of production labor/capital etc from being employed. In the past, you'd simply go to war and steal more gold - then you'd have more "money", more people could be employed once again. That solution isn't a good option, yet it's littered much of our history when nations have run into a money shortage.
Bitcoin has no measures to prevent money shortages so far as I can tell. It offers no guarantees that it'll lead to high employment, and I have every reason to fear it'd do the opposite. If it leads to an underemployed economy, which I fear it would, it leads to a reduction in real wealth generation.
Ideally, the government would always ensure that it's spending and/or loaning enough such that everyone in the economy can afford to put aside what they desire to save, pay their taxes, and spend sufficiently so that everyone desiring to work can do the same. I don't see any way in Bitcoin that that can be remotely ensured.

No. If you place one million bets on Satoshi, some will return virtually nothing, some will return more than the bet, but the average return - the expected return - will be 98% of each bet.
$1000 worth of bets will, on average, turn into $980. Re"investing" that $980 in bets would turn it in to $960. Repeat until the casino has all the gambler's money and they have none. This is how casino's make money - by having a positive expected return for them, and a negative for you.
Now I may get "lucky" or "unlucky" and end up with more or less than this average, but the more samples the closer your average return will be to the expected return. It's why you can't beat the casino regardless of what betting scheme you use - the odds are stacked in the house's favour. It wouldn't be a business if they weren't.

If Bitcoin leads to an economy where unemployment is higher than alternative monetary systems, it would be leading to lower wealth.

You overcomplicate things far too much, leading you to the wrong conclusions. QE isn't inflationary simply because for every dollar printed, a dollar worth of financial assets are removed from circulation. One for one, with every $ added a $ worth of financial assets are removed.
The Fed prints $1000 to remove a bond worth $1000 from circulation. The net financial assets of the non-Fed part of the economy do not change, only their liquidity has (and only ever so slightly at that). Our ability to bid up prices, to purchase goods/services remains unchanged.
See, whether you have $1mn worth of bonds or $1mn worth of cash, your net worth is the same. If you own $1mn in bonds, you always have every ability to sell or borrow against those bonds should you want to bid up prices.. that you're holding them simply indicates that you'd rather save today. Swapping virtually zero interest bonds for zero interest cash isn't going to suddenly change your spending/savings preferences. QE merely swaps the latter for the former, the effect should be more or less non-inflationary... which is what we see.
About all that can be said for QE is that it helps the Fed keep inflation expectations at its target - if the Fed says "we're going to see 2% inflation this year and we're going to print money til we get it" people are going to expect to see 2% inflation. The market is [growing wise to this]( with every additional round of QE however.
If your theory was correct, had the government printed $3tn (enough to employ every unemployed person in the US at the full minimum wage for over 15 years) to give as tax refunds or build infrastructure, the effect would have been little more inflationary than the Fed buying bonds. Would have lifted M1 by the same amount and you make out that that's all that matters. This is simply not true - the former approach would have been far more inflationary (and seen a larger increase in real GDP) than the latter approach.
Printing money to remove financial assets from circulation does not alter our net financial position in USD denominated terms. That means it grants us no additional ability to bid up prices, nor to place demand on the economy. It's that simple.

It's limited. Cryptocurrencies aren't.
If we were to discover a way to easily convert between elements or a huge natural source of gold, make no mistake, it would be worthless overnight.
If we were to discover a way to make infinite different clones of "gold" each just as limited as the first and each with identical properties - I wouldn't want my nation to choose one willy nilly to store its wealth in. There's just no guarantee that other nations would recognise that store of wealth as valuable, yet that's what you need for your nation's reserves. Others to recognise it.

That it's not going to be replaced is a very important feature if you are to pump billions into it, to try and store wealth in a world-recognised fashion. ie, if you are a central bank as the article goes on to talk to about.
We all know that if the bank just started its own fork, premined a few million coins before announcing it.. nobody would care. They haven't stored any wealth, for their coins just wouldn't be wanted by anyone. How can they/anyone else be sure that BTC would be that different going into the future?

Your post takes a very supply sided view of jobs. Of wealth creators, "productive people produce" and employ, etc.
What this neglects is that you can only ever sell something if you can find someone willing to part their cash for it. That total spending in the economy = total income, and that you want total income to be high enough for everyone to have a job. Money shortages can, and do, lead to cases of productive people being unable to find work. ie today there's plenty of willing productive youth in Greece today, but 58% of them can't find jobs for a shortage of spending.
What I don't see is how Bitcoin can ever promise that it won't lead to insufficient income for high employment, like what's facing much of the Euro zone today.
I am aware the Euro is fiat - but it does have a lot in common with fixed money supplies or the gold standard. Individual nations can end up with a shortage of money, just like under both those systems.

Bank losses had nothing to do with people trying to withdraw their money - this in itself causes no problems under the Euro or any other central banking system as a well capitalised bank can always borrow on the interbank lending markets (or directly from the central bank via the discount window) to cover their required reserve position. It'd be a silly monetary system if a mere bank run led to banking collapses - today, they do not.
The hold on withdrawals was not out of concern of fractional reserve banking (again, when you can borrow from the central bank its irrelevant) but to keep funds captured to fund the bail-in, to cover the bank's financial losses.
These losses came largely from holding [Greek bonds]( [Like all market participants]( they assumed government bonds were a safe store of wealth - yet they lost upwards of 50% in a [haircut]( That's to say nothing of all the loans to the Greek private sector that were defaulted on as a direct result of the severe austerity imposed on Greece by the troika.
Now if Cyprus wasn't part of the EMU, they could have done like Iceland. Yes, Iceland's exchange rate took a dive - but unemployment and growth has been improving steadily since (see the graphs at the bottom of [this]( article). Cyprus is not going to be so lucky - the trajectory they're on is most definitely that of Greece.
EDIT: To some extent the losses are besides the point: the real harm that's going to come to Cyprus in the coming years will be in the form of job losses, youth unemployment, reduced output. When you have you own currency, you cannot protect everyone's wealth if they (or their financial institutions) choose to gamble, but you can at least ensure that at all times they are producing and consuming all they desire to, that a shortage of money in circulation need never prevent people from working.
If the currency is outside of your control though, a sudden loss leads to a scurry for savings, leads to an economy with insufficient spending for high employment. This means real incomes fall, real production and consumption falls, and the way of life of everyone deteriorates. This is something that Bitcoin can help you with no more than the Euro, but had Cyprus kept the pound it needn't have been a problem.

Artificial rates? Interest rates are always "artificial" in that they're always based around your arbitrary choice of monetary system.
If you base money around Bitcoin, you'll end up with different real interest rates than if you base it around gold, or a cryptocurrency that continues to slowly grow, or a cryptocurrency that recycles lost coins or charges demurrage (ie Freicoin), or a cryptocurrency that destroys coins (ie half the transaction fee is removed forever), etc.
Your arbitrary choice of monetary system ends up determining interest rates, there quite simply is no such thing as a "natural rate" of interest.

An issue I have here is that it seems that you believe that via money supply trickery we can temporarily live *beyond our means*.
I cannot believe that for a second.
We are at all times limited by the real resources available to us, and are at all times consuming (or wasting) all we are producing less what we are net exporting. How can we possibly be living beyond what those real resources permit?
What I argue is simply that we should never allow our choice of money supply to prevent us from fully making use of the real resources, such as labor, available to us. Tie our money down to arbitrary metals or a completely fixed supply, and *money*, a resource we have invented, may well end up holding us back from being able to fully realise those real resources available to us. And for what? Because that previous level of production was unsustainable? How can that be so?


It didn't have widespread adoption until King Offa got involved. Wikipedia [1]( [2]( and [Currencyinformation.org](


Consider what happens if a bunch of nations sharing a currency all decide to save at once, say due to a global recession (these *do* still occur with commodity money).
Now under the gold standard, this savings desire can be resolved by more mining of gold, eventually it'll be satiated and spending can resume. The private sector can create net savings, no problem there.
Under government fiat, the government sector can run a deficit to satiate the savings desire such that spending can resume. The public sector can create net private sector savings, no problem there.
Under Bitcoin? Well, for that look to the Eurozone. That's a prime example of what happens when you have a money system that does not allow the private sector to create net savings, *nor* governments to supply those savings. What happens is the nations with the strongest export sectors manage to acquire their savings from those losing theirs, and the remaining countries - their households have to acquire their savings from one another as net savings cannot be increased. Accordingly, not everyone can be afforded an income, employment drops.. you end up with the economy performing well under par, all due to a shortage of a man-made construct, money.
This would be Bitcoin. A money supply that does not allow the private sector to create net savings *nor* the government sector. That's just the Eurozone, and it is bad.

The concern over deflation isn't that the currency would collapse, but that output would collapse.

Not because they were inefficient or had poor products - just because those bakers didn't make good financial traders.

Just because I recognise that real wealth is the result of human labor does not mean that I believe money to be neutral. If there's two money systems, one that leads to unemployment and the other that is fully employed, the latter will lead to higher real wealth. I believe that a poorly designed monetary system vs a well designed one can make that difference, therefore I do not believe money to be neutral.


Of course. We are always constrained by the real factors of production. Try and exceed them, and you'll see prices rise instead of output. This can occur on smaller scales too, ie you may exceed steel production capacity before exhausting labor.
'70s stagflation was an example of this - energy constraining production whilst labor was still idle.


Savings *does* equal investment. This is an accounting identity that is too often found inconvenient and simply glossed over. You can't just do that, they are equal at all times.
In your example, rather than creating more fiat through bank lending, the firm perhaps sells $1mn worth of bonds to the public. The savers buy them, moving $1mn to the firm which it uses to buy a robot.
What do you have there though? Savers still possessing the same $1mn in savings, just now in the form of bonds instead of fiat. They now have a tradable asset worth $1mn in the place of their $1mn of fiat. A firm now has a new robot worth $1mn (the investment), offset by $1mn of debt. The robot manufacturer now has $1mn in income they previously would not have had.
    Savings    Savers          Firm  RobotManu
    Pre:       $1mn            $0    $0
    Post:      $1mn (in bonds) $0    $1mn
That is, the robot manufacturer's increased savings equals, to the dollar, the investment by the firm without other savers in the economy have lost a single dollar. Investment has directly added to savings in the economy.
Yes, this time it's in the form of assets instead of fiat, but the effect is the same. Those savers can sell or borrow against their $1mn in financial assets, they have not "lost" their savings in any meaningful way by purchasing those bonds. Furthermore, those Robot Manufacturers now have $1mn in savings that *they too* can loan out. Even without fractional reserve banking, the same $1mn can be lent over and over and over again in the form of bond sales. It's just the nature of money. Loaning/investing it, in whatever form, ultimately is equivalent to creating more of it.


FWIW, I personally feel interest rates shouldn't be tinkered with. If it were up to me, I'd keep the risk-free rate at zero (where it would [naturally be]( if the government ceased bond sales) whilst simultaneously aiming for zero unskilled wage labor inflation, and I would use fiscal policy to achieve it.
I do believe that having real negative interest rates (such as today) is a bad idea, as it makes it impossible to store wealth in the currency - I can easily imagine it does lead to people making bad, desperate, investment decisions just in a vain attempt to store wealth. So to that degree, I am in agreement with the Austrian school.
That said, I disagree with the sushi economy parable. It, as is so often the case with Austrian economics, is assuming a fully employed economy from the start and Krugman's fiscal policy recommendations breaking it. Economies are rarely fully employed, least of all many around the world today. Try the scenario again, but this time with 10% of the people sitting on their hands at the start, and you *can* increase output merely by mobilising them.

But your concern is that loaning may start increasing, right? That was your analogy about Ted, earlier, burying money - the concern that it may end up being loaned out when it'd suddenly become inflationary.
My point is - the Fed can stop this at any point by simply lifting rates, and it doesn't even need to remove excess reserves to do so.
Tomorrow, if it wanted to, it could lift the IOR that it pays to 10% and you'd nearly instantly start seeing your saving account returning 10% discouraging you from spending just as quickly as you'd see mortgages increase to 13%+. Modern theory, including those two papers I link, suggests that that would drastically reduce the amount of loans that go out, *despite the excess reserves*. At that, where is the concern that QE may lead to rapid inflationary conflagration when we can reduce loaning and encourage saving anytime we want?
Surely you agree that no bank would loan to a householder for a lower interest rate than it'd get for leaving its reserves as reserves.. at that, does IOR not grant us the ability to reduce loaning anytime we desire despite what the theory of fractional reserve banking in the instance of excess reserves may suggest?

Don't you see the problem there? If Zimbabwe adopts Bitcoin, and its people decide that they want more than a few BTC in their economy, they need to sell real stuff to foreigners (or depend on charity, your other two options). We get diamonds, they get bits. If Zimbabwean households decide they want to net save a few more thousand BTC, they need to export yet more diamonds.
Ok, perhaps the problem's not yet apparent. But how does this work in aggregate? Say two nations both want to use Bitcoin. If a crisis of some sort leads to them both wanting to net save 1000BTC, you end up with the problem of [mercantilism]( - an economic policy that fails in aggregate because it supposes that every nation should attempt to export more than it imports, so that they can increase their supply of *money*, so that they can all have jobs.
This is a problem unique to if your money comes from outside of your nation. Half the drive towards mercantilism was due to so many countries deciding to call "gold" money, so that there was the eternal tug of war between who got to save in gold, and who had to dissave. The Spanish Empire called Silver "money", which meant they had to dig it up in Peru to be able to employ the growing population at home meaning the action of pirates on the seas caused immense economic damage to the empire. Etc.
It just doesn't work. On the other hand, if you choose to make money come from *within*, it's all perfectly sustainable and flexible. When your people decide to net save, the government can simply run a deficit - ensuring that at all times the saving desire is met and there's sufficient money being spent for full employment. If your people want to buy something from overseas, that's fine - they export something to equal value. They're no longer exporting just to import "money" (ie bits if Bitcoin, or fiat if USD), now they export to buy real goods and services. They no longer need to suffer unemployment due to money shortages, for an appropriate deficit ensures that saving desires can always be met.
It is true that this depends on a benevolent government, something that Zimbabwe does not yet have. I'm just saying, using Bitcoin - a currency from outside the nation - you're going to find as inflexible as using the rand, or the USD. It doesn't solve the problem that to bring in "money", you need to send real goods and services overseas - and that if multiple countries decide to call the same thing of fixed supply "money", you end up with the problem of mercantilism. It's no solution.

This video beats down but a strawman, a bunch of hypotheticals that bear no resemblance to reality.
I mean, the government dropped fiscal policy due to people stopping lending it the money it issues? What rot.
That just cannot happen - no matter how much debt the US government has, you're always safer loaning USD to the US government (which has the printing press) than anyone else. Hence why free-floating currency-issuing governments don't ever see bonds spike.
Anyway, so ignoring that that just doesn't happen, the government then moves on to quantitative easing (which the author clearly does not understand at all - the government doesn't "spend" QEd money), but this becomes hyperinflationary? Even more rot. The Fed's not even hitting its minimum inflation targets today.
Anyway, so they drop monetary policy. After dropping fiscal policy. And they then move onto stealing, Cyprus style? Why would the government do that when it has every capacity to borrow USD? Oh right, no one's lending the US government USD anymore. Or they've run out of USD or something. What rot.

Under Bitcoin it is impossible for everyone to save BTC simultaneously as for you to save 1 BTC someone else must dissave that same BTC.
Under fiat, the currency-issuer can always run deficits to allow whatever savings the non-public desire. That is, if the non-public sector desires to save $1tn USD, the US public sector can simply run a $1tn deficit. We put aside the after-tax savings of $1tn as, well, savings.
Currently we make this hard, by pressuring the government to try and "balance its budget" (ie "cap our level of savings") - but there's no need to be tight with money like this. The government's no business - we can simply allow it to run whatever deficits are required to satiate our desire to save, such as spending in the economy is such that we can all work for an income should we desire to. That is, the government can **always** dissave USD to allow us to save USD.
Under BTC, that's impossible. The government is limited in its ability to supply BTC savings to us, and there's no recourse if we try to save more than that. Just a government that's run out of BTC, meaning it has to pursue austerity. Under austerity those with the most secure incomes (most likely the wealthy) will continue to succeed in putting aside BTC, but this time it'll be at the expense of those with less secure incomes that will likely lose their jobs (source of income) altogether, rather than the government. This is what we see when governments pursue austerity (be tight with money) - unemployment and overall inequality rises. Under Bitcoin the government would have no choice but to pursue austerity when we start trying to save and so I can only see inequality rising under a hypothetical BTC-run country.

No, income is what you need for employment.
See wealth is a stock, income is a flow, and employment is a flow. If you want to employ someone from a stock, you'll eventually end up with none left. Your wealth will deteriorate. Your "wealth" is a bathtub of water, income is the tap, employment is the plughole - if you're trying to pay people with wealth alone you'll soon end up with none.
For this reason businesses only employ people based on how much money they receive or expect to receive, not based on how much money they have on hand. You can't long-term pay a flow with a stock, you need to pay it with a flow.
Hence employment is based around how much income there is in the economy. If you have not enough income (which is equal to consumption), employment will fall off.


And yet your only historical example of a deflationary currency is the gold standard - an incredibly different monetary system.
Under the gold standard the environment places an open ended bid order for labor, promising to pay anyone willing to panhandle a certain amount of money a relatively constant rate of money. It's equivalent to a Bitcoin model where anyone willing to devote their labor to manually mining can always earn a nominal rate of Bitcoins. This makes a *massive* difference - for one, it anchors the price of unskilled labor. For two, it ensures there's never a jobs shortage. For three, money shortages just can't present long-term, as they're corrected by the market - not enough money? More rush to the mines. Too much money and wages are inflated? Leave the mines and work for a higher wage elsewhere. It's a relatively stable system, based around the fact that people's time is convertible to gold. It's not so different to a fiat money system based around a [job guarantee]( system.
Bitcoin though, the amount of money decreases over time (with lost wallets). Labor cannot solve a money shortage, as there is no open ended bid order for unskilled labor placed by anyone. Jobs and money shortages can present, and there's not much anyone can do about them. Keeping employment high was just not one of its design goals.


It won't become a currency until a government begins taxing in it. As long as you need USD to pay your taxes, you *have* to acquire USD. You don't have a choice in it. If a government were to begin taxing in Bitcoin tomorrow, it'd become a currency overnight.

The scary thing is all those people looking at using Bitcoin to generate fiat profits.
That's simply unsustainable. It's very ponzi-esque - you can only withdraw as much USD as others are putting in, and it's impossible for everyone to make profits in that manner. The latest to the game will always end up finding that no one else is putting in, and they're left with nothing - the money they put in was withdrawn by the earlier profit-seekers.
Now a *store* of value is perhaps possible provided that Bitcoin is always the only crypto-currency, but even that I find a bit shaky. It's all well and good that the number of coins is limited, but when the number of forks/clones/alternative crypto-currencies is infinite.. I wouldn't assure anyone that their value is safe with Bitcoin.
But that's just me.

There's nothing natural about money, it's a man-made construct.
If we decide to tie our money supply to how much gold we can dig out of the ground that's going to give a completely different "price signal" between savings and investment to if we decide to tie it to copper, to oil, to the decisions of central bankers, or compared to completely fixing it in quantity. These will all yield completely different loaning regimes, completely different spending patterns, and completely different levels of employment and growth.
How can you look at the gold standard and say "That was good" and then continue to say "so clearly fixed would be ideal"? They're completely different systems that will yield completely different results! Besides, if deflationary is so good why not have an outright deflationary money supply? I dunno, one where half the transaction fees paid are permanently removed from circulation - would that be even better? Why/why not?

It's a buyer spending Bitcoin, BitPay immediately putting that Bitcoin up for exchange, and the buyer immediately putting USD up for exchange to buy that Bitcoin back. It's effectively the buyer paying USD for their own Bitcoin, with BitPay and the exchanges taking a cut along the way. But that's the cost of proselytizing I guess.

Historical review [shows otherwise](
Currencies traditionally are a creature of the state - we work for them, because if we do not we cannot pay taxes. Without taxes, we cannot earn an income, own property, or basically function in a country.
This is the case whether the currency is backed by gold or true fiat. eg, Africans didn't care that the British told them their coins were "rare" (how would you even know to trust them?). All they cared about was that there were consequences if they could not acquire enough of them to pay their [hut taxes](
If you're going to claim otherwise, you need to be able to explain why the Canadian dollar - which is [not required]( to be accepted for any commercial transaction - dominates in Canada. The chartalist explanation is clear: because Canadians need the CAD for their taxes, giving it value, making it dominant. As far as I know, the "faith based fiat money" theory has no explanation for this phenomena, other than sheer luck that Canadians all agree to value the CAD.

Why can't the government manufacture a "liquidity trap" any time it desires through lifting taxes? Can it not always discourage consumption in this manner?
At that, why don't we just forget about government debt and make this the new "normalcy". Always spend "new cash" to the extent that everyone's employed, when/if lending picks up, lift taxes - when/if spending drops off leaving unemployment rising, lift spending (or lower taxes). Strong automatic stablisers such as MMTers advocate for would do this entirely automatically.
To me it seems there's no amount of unemployment that boosting spending towards labor cannot solve and there's no amount of inflation that cannot be prevented with higher taxes. What more can one ask from a monetary and fiscal system than one that keeps everyone employed at all times and prices stable?
If you don't like that, how do you feel about interest on reserves? Through IOR the Fed can implement any floor interest rate it desires - even without using bonds to soak up excess liquidity. That is, if the Fed pays 5% interest on excess reserves you'd never see a loan for less than 5%, and similarly you ought find a bank you can leave your money with that'd return you 5% interest on your savings account. At that if you don't like the idea of using taxation to keep consumption at a level the economy can support and prefer interest rates (ie the status quo), what problem do you have with using IOR to achieve this? Why should we use bonds, which carry all the hysteria over government debt and lead us in situations such as today with so many million unemployed?

Because they can't, they're not in a bubble.
The market assumes that the government would sooner print than default, and accordingly it *has* to be granted the lowest interest lending attainable in the currency. There's just no two ways about it.
No bank is going to ever lend out a mortgage for a lower or equal return to what they can get on bonds, accordingly bonds can't "pop" short of a collapse of all USD-denominated lending.
If the US bonds market were to pop, or Japan's or any other government's where the bonds are denominated in the free-floating currency they issue, it'd be a historical first. It's literally never happened before.

It's all well and good for you to invent a new way of harvesting wood that costs 1000x as much as the current techniques - *that does not mean that the price will jump such that you can sell at that price*.
Same story with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and everything else. Just because a bunch of mining hardware gets switched on such that these are now 10x as expensive to harvest does not mean that the prices of these coins will rise to 10x the current price such that that new mining hardware is profitable. Rather the opposite, mining will remain unprofitable until such time as demand pushes the price up a sufficient amount, *or* until such time as enough miners are switched off that it is once again profitable to mine.
Think of [supply/demand]( charts - Bitcoins are of fixed supply, meaning that the price is **entirely determined by demand**. Not by how costly you can make them to mine.

Bernanke is performing an asset swap to the tune of $120,000,000.00 per hour.
Asset swaps do not increase anyone's buying power nor wealth. Markets set prices according to demand/supply, *not* total money out there/supply: if Bernanke is not increasing demand via increasing banking liquidity inflation to be expected is minimal at best.. as we have seen.

Then we simply reduce spending directly through government expenditure, by lifting interest rates or by increasing taxes. This isn't nearly as hard as you're making it out to be.


Simply not true. CPI is low, as are [alternative measures]( Unless you're on some fringe site that makes money off peddling fear - ie shadowstats - you're not going to see otherwise. America is not in a state of stagflation, just the far more traditional case of low demand causing low employment.


Where's all this money coming from? If government deficits, clearly we've stopped it at the source by lifting taxes. If higher velocity, removing money has a massively amplified effect - it'd be easy for a few days to cough up the $10k but soon many would find there's not the wheelbarrows of cash being run into their stores they used to be. Either way, higher taxes solve the problem.


Because it wasn't tried. Even Argentina today is trying price controls instead of reigning in the inflationary deficit.
You may now go "ah-ha! there's your problem, we'd be just as stupid and not raise taxes/lower deficits either, even when they're proving inflationary", but all you have revealed there is that the government - if it wants to - can screw things up badly for us. There's nothing new there.
This isn't a realistic hypothetical though. Contrary to what you think we have *heaps* of space in monetary policy to control inflation before needing to even touch the budget. The budget isn't drastically different to what it was under Bush, I see no reason to believe that it's going to be the cause of high inflation anytime soon. Nor do I see any reason to believe that the Fed cannot lift rates if it decides that spending needs to be reduced.
All that aside though, personally, if I had a shot at changing our monetary system.. I'd implement an independent body that sets the rate of a land value tax with the goal of controlling inflation. If Argentina had such a body today it'd simply raise that tax and inflation would be nipped in the bud. I'd additionally stop the Fed from adjusting interest rates, stop issuing bonds bonds, and just have deficit spends introduce cash straight into the system - ending concern over government debt permanently. If we need more spending the independent body just allows the government to deficit spend further, if we need less it lifts rates. If we implemented strong automatic stabilisers the independent body would hardly need to do any adjustments at all. But that's just me/my preferred solution.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:06:28


What? Why? Will I/you/everyone not still need fiat to pay back the debt incurred in creating the fiat in the first place, and to pay our taxes?
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:59:54
ELI 15 and apologies for the long reply, it's hard to describe our monetary system in anything less:
When the government wants to spend more than it taxes, it prints some promises to pay back X after a certain date. It sells these at auction, and people and institutions purchase them. These promises are called bonds, or securities.
The difference between the face value, X, and the auction price is the rate of interest the government is being charged.
So whenever the government deficit spends, that is, spends more than it taxes, it is creating financial assets, increasing the paper wealth of the non-government. Before a $1bn deficit there may be $10tn in financial assets and cash, after the deficit there's still the same $10tn but now an additional $1bn in newly created financial assets. The non-government has purchased these assets (bonds) but received back the very money it spent buying them as the government spends - it is wealthier for the deficit spend. You can see this right there on the [US debt clock]( - the green "household assets" figure includes the very securities that make up all those red numbers.
Government surpluses are the opposite - a destruction of paper wealth. Now I would argue that the government ought always run deficits sufficient to satiate our desire to save and then spend suitable for full employment although not so high as to cause inflation (which may mean surpluses when demand for savings are low), although many people and economists believe we ought limit these savings, out of concern that one day the government may find a shortage of people willing to buy these promises from the government to pay $X of the currency the government issues, and that at that point the government would have to resort to money printing instead of bond printing - something many believe would be very inflationary.
Anyway, so that's bonds, where they come from, why they have value. They're a promise from the currency-issuer to pay X of the currency it issues at Y date, and therefore there's a queue a mile long of people willing to purchase them (every auction is massively oversubscribed).
Now the next bit is a bit more technical. Money is created through borrowing. It's where it comes from. When a bank issues a loan, it creates a deposit in your account - and that deposit is simply new money.
To keep the rate of money creation and spending through borrowing consistent with what the economy can support without being overly inflationary, the Fed alters interest rates - making borrowing more expensive when the economy is at capacity, and cheaper when there's heaps of idle labor/resources.
It currently does this by altering the supply of bonds. When the Fed needs rates to go down it buys bonds off the banks, supplying them with cash and draining them of a safe place to store their savings. More bonds (supply) for equal demand = a lower price = a higher interest rate, remembering that the difference between the face value and the market value = the interest rate.
When it needs rates to go up it does the opposite, selling bonds it's previously purchased, draining banks of cash and offering them an alternative place to store their savings than in household mortgages - a safer place, government bonds. Fewer bonds = a higher price = a lower interest rate.
So by altering the supply of bonds vs cash, a floor rate of interest can be established, a rate that banks would never undercut. See, if a bank can buy a bond returning 5% interest it'll never loan to a householder at 5% interest - why would you, when loaning USD to the US government carries so much less risk? A ceiling rate is also established - if bonds are returning just 2% then any other loan considered very safe, such as an overnight interbank loan, would go for 2% interest. These overnight interbank loans are what the Fed is actually targeting (the federal funds target rate), and it alters them via altering the supply of bonds.
So anyway, that's the Fed - how it alters interest rates and how bonds play an important part of monetary policy (so important that when Australia "paid back its debt" the government continued issuing bonds anyway as monetary policy is utterly dependent on them - Norway is in the same boat).
The next question is QE, and why it isn't inflationary. Firstly, QE is the Fed continuing to buy bonds even once rates are already at zero, in the vain hope that banks will get so frustrated by these cash reserves that they'll create/find more customers to lend to. So the floor interest rate is already at zero but Bernanke's desperately hoping that he can frustrate banks into making further loans. Needless to say, it's not terribly successful - a cursory look over GDP/employment figures reveals that. It's also not terribly inflationary though, as it matters not to me whether I have a piece of paper that is valued at $1bn or cash that is valued at $1bn, my wealth is the same. I can buy a street of houses with $1bn in bonds, I can buy a street of houses with $1bn in cash. My ability to bid up prices, my ability to create asset bubbles - I can just as easily do both with bonds as I can with cash.
Whilst banks may be frustrated by sitting on a heap of zero yield cash reserves, they're equally frustrated over sitting on a heap of zero yield bonds. Now that the Fed has already made bonds virtually equivalent to cash - by lowering rates to 0% - nothing much at all happens in swapping one with the other. The principle purpose of bonds is to soak up excess liquidity when we need higher interest rates - when we're not using them for that purpose they really may as well be cash.
The most Ben can really hope for is by creating inflation *expectations*, which are inflationary, but the market is now wise to this - with every new round of QE the inflationary impact is less and less, a problem for the Fed summarised beautifully by geerussel [here](
Now the disclaimer: this post draws heavily on [MMT]( but is not too far out of mainstream, with Krugman also [admitting equivalence between bonds/cash today](

Not at all! If so, every fork of Bitcoin would have the exact same value as the original. Clearly not true.


I mean this is just an outrageous suggestion. If I print just one TheMania dollar, it'd have the same value as all GBP out there added together? Absurd.
No. It's best that you think of currency's as assets - the price is determined by how eager people are to sell the currency vs how eager others are to buy it. In the case of regular currencies, these are rooted in exports - demand for GBP is created by people that desire to buy British exports (inc. tourism), and sellers of GBP are those looking to buy exports from other countries. On top of that you have speculators and people looking to store wealth in currencies that are not their own, but the main determinants are the strength of one's export industries vs their demand for imports. If they demand more imports or choose to store wealth in alternative currencies, their currency depreciates - if more foreigners demand their exports or to store wealth in their currency, it appreciates.
Now in the case of Bitcoin and people using it to transfer fiat, their actions do not raise the value of Bitcoin. It's a buy order immediately followed by a sell order - the same amount of fiat enters Bitcoin at the buy as is removed at the sell. It doesn't lead to a permanent appreciation.
If they choose to hold on to Bitcoin though, more fiat enters but none leaves until they sell. The more people buying and holding, the higher the value. The problem, and where people call it ponzi-ish, is that if people are holding on to it merely to make more fiat - the fiat they extract is the fiat new "investors" are pumping in. A few people can extract more fiat than they put in, but it's impossible for everyone to do this. A few at the end end up putting money in but taking no money out, they've provided the profits the others have reaped.
Now I'm not saying Bitcoin is suffering that problem for that would be heresy on this subreddit, but it ought be a genuine concern. People need to be buying Bitcoin to use in a real Bitcoin economy, with no goal of making profits on converting it back to fiat (preferably they don't want to convert it back at all) - for not everyone can derive profits in that manner. It's simply impossible.

The thing you're missing is that bond printing is little different to printing money.
A promise from the currency issuer to pay $1000 at X date is as safe as the money it is denominated in, accordingly these bonds *always* sell for high prices. In fact, they sell for prices at the central bank's choosing - they will always trade within a couple of basis points of expectations of the central bank set federal funds rate over the term of the bond.
Nobody ought be outraged over the government printing $1tn worth of pieces of paper called cash to fund a deficit but semi-OK with the government printing $1tn in pieces of paper called bonds to fund the same deficit. They have the same impact on our buying power, the same impact on our net financial assets - *both* forms of funding a deficit increase the non-government's NFA by a full $1tn. One way we end up with $1tn worth of additional cash, the other $1tn worth of additional bonds, but it matters not - whether you/I own a few thousand in bonds or in cash, our wealth is the same. Our ability to buy things, to place demand on the economy, to bid up prices, is the same.
That's why the "money printing" over the past few years has had no adverse impact on inflation despite dwarfing taxation. It was the individual deficits themselves, each only adding a comparatively small amount of USD-denominated NFA, that had the potential to be inflationary. The Fed now converting those gradually accrued NFA from one kind (bonds) to another (cash) does not change anyone's wealth or anyone's buying power in the slightest. It's a non-inflationary maneuver.

If you have fixed supply of something and high demand, the price will be high. If you have infinite supply of something and high demand, the price will be low.

You're letting your ideology rewrite history there. From what we know of history all but informal currencies have [originated with the state](
The state defines and manufactures the coins, it taxes and pays people in that currency, and that becomes the currency of trade. See, Africa didn't adopt the British pound because it thought it was neat that it was backed by something the British claimed was rare - they adopted it because there were penalties if they couldn't collect enough of it to pay their [hut taxes]( That's the most obvious case of how taxes drive a currency, but the same thing has happened in (as far as I know) every case that has been well studied. And when the state's currency breaks down? The "market" returns to bartering or currencies such as rice.
Same with Bitcoin - it won't form a nation's economy until a government starts taxing in it. And I hope that day never comes.


This is where your argument becomes absurd to me. We've had currencies based on electrum, gold, silver, rice, copper, bronze.. these will all give *very* different rates of interests and yet you seem to think this is just no big deal.  Interest rates fluctuate even more not based on how close the economy is at capacity, but because of things like trade deficits, gold mines running dry, new gold mines being discovered, new mining techniques, gold being lost to war, "New World" discovery.. eugh, that last one makes my skin crawl.
Imagine finding your economy being in recession due to a lack of money and the only solution being to start a war with Africa to capture their massive natural gold reserves! Crazy. Yet that's the kind of thing the world did for hundreds of years, because governments chose to base their money on something you find in the ground. If you're nation's running dry - you just capture one that has more! Craziest thing to me was the collapse of the massive Spanish empire largely coming about due to pirates blocking their boats bringing silver into the country - such an arbitrary decision, basing your money on a resource you largely find in foreign nations, and then a blockade leading to a collapse of the entire economy.
And yet Bitcoin would have that exact same problem, but with even fewer solutions! There cannot be a Bitcoin "New World", there cannot be more Bitcoin reserves found, you cannot hope to run continual trade surpluses with Bitcoin wealthy nations.. you're left perhaps with war looking as the only feasible option to get out of recession, as has so often happened in the past. Your nation is suffering a spending crisis but England seems to have a lot of Bitcoin? Go up and seize it! I mean, what else could you do?
Eugh. It'd be a horrible, horrible currency to base an economy around. Again, I hope it never happens. And no, it'd be nothing like the gold standard. You say that gold is "relatively fixed in supply" - yet wages managed to *increase* over the [19th century]( Under Bitcoin, they'd have to have fallen considerably - as you say, there was considerable growth in this time. There could be no two ways about it. You may like the gold standard, but it does not translate that a completely fixed money supply would yield similar results.

@_date: 2013-06-13 20:13:48
I very highly doubt that.
The whole point of "reserves" is that they be recognised and valued by other nations, so that you can defend your currency when/if desired.
Additionally the nations with the largest reserves have got them principally via currency manipulation - when you want to foster your export sector, you sell a few newly minted digital dollars on fx markets and buy USD. This bolsters your reserves - China's ended up with billions of them doing just that.
I just don't see where Bitcoins fit into either use category. If you're competitively devaluing you'd do it by simply buying USD, the currency you directly want to devalue against.
And if you're buying them to store wealth/prop up your currency in the future you need to be darn sure that what you're buying will be recognised by other countries in the distant future. USD fills that role well - you *know* that there's 350mn taxpayers dependent on it. Bitcoin though? Who's going to be the first country to pump billions into Bitcoin and why would they expect other central banks to recognise it as "wealth"? Heck - why even Bitcoin. Why not just fork your own crypto, and call that your nation's reserves?
I just really don't think a few businesses around the world accepting it is going to hold up when it comes to a nation's reserves. Several hundred million dependent on it, *yes*, a few businesses no. Without a huge guaranteed market, no nation would dare hold them as a reserve asset. I just don't see a catalyst here where suddenly every nation will decide that Bitcoins/Litecoins/Feathercoins/PPcoins/what-have-you-coins are going to be recognised as "wealth" going into the future. The USD is easy to see, as is any other tax-backed fiat - but cryptocurrencies? I just don't see it.

Here we'd be putting 25 million people into work with this spending, getting some billion man hours of additional production *per week*. That's a lot more bread being produced. Again, if you double the amount of bread being produced you have to double the amount of spending just to keep prices steady, let alone rise.

Very true. Bonds don't offset the inflationary impact of government spending, their functional purpose is to soak up excess liquidity that would be introduced if the government simply spent - and even that is only required when interest rates are desired to be above 0%. And even *that* is only required if the central bank isn't selling its own bonds/refinancing measures or paying interest on reserves.

Because real wealth is created by people working. If real interest rates are too high such that people and capital are left unemployed, that is a real loss of potential wealth that you never get back.
Yes, from the perspective of someone loaning a fixed supply quantity they'd be "destroying wealth", but only because you've chosen to fix your quantity of money. Had you not, had a central bank simply provided them with a -1% real interest loan, they could have gone on to produce whatever widgets they desired to whilst not "using up" or "destroying" any real wealth. They would just be adding to it, instead of sitting idle.

The reason I keep a fair portion of my savings in AUD and AUD denominated assets is because I know those AUD will be valuable to some 22mn people that live in the country I do. They need AUD to pay their taxes and pay back debts, if I have AUD I'm assured that I can trade with them in the future. There's going to be demand for them for as long as the government levies taxes.
The reason I should keep wealth in Bitcoin over Litecoin is... because..  see, that's where I get stumped. If BitPay added seamless support for paying with Litecoin tomorrow, why should I choose one over the other? How can I be sure that my money will be safe in either, long term? Yes, Bitcoin can always incorporate features from other altcoins meaning that it's never going to be left behind - but why would anyone trust their wealth in it in the first place?
I just can't see any *need* for Bitcoin that cannot be fulfilled by the infinite number of potential altcoins. That makes the "fixed supply" point of Bitcoin moot for me - what's the point in having a fixed number of coins when the number of potential altcoins is infinite?

Don't fret, brevity isn't my strong point either ;). Enjoying/learning from the discussion so far.


I would absolutely agree with that. I do want to stress that real wealth is created by people, not by printing presses.
The thing is - constraints on nominal wealth can impede real wealth generation. If people are withholding currency to the extent that people are ending up unemployed, it's potential for real wealth that has been lost forever to us.


I read to the end of the chapter, however I take a very different view on savings and investment.
Specifically I believe I can explain what he considers nonsensical in this paragraph:
*In sum, we are apparently to understand that while saving and investment are "necessarily equal" and "merely
different aspects of the same thing," yet saving reduces employment and incomes and investment increases employment and incomes!*
Firstly, yes they are the same thing. This is an accounting identity, we know it to be true. The question should be though, which of the two (if either) is volitional? Do we decide to save, and does that increase investment (as Hazlitt argues), or do we decide to invest and does that increase our level of savings?
The answer is simply the latter. We do not, in aggregate, decide to save. Generally, if you decide to increase your level of savings someone else must have had theirs decreased. If you decide to lower your level of savings, someone else must have had theirs *increased*.
The latter is easy to see. You have $50k, and you decide now that you want to consume. So you spend it all on a holiday down south, and what have you done? Put $50k in other people's bank accounts. Shopkeepers, innkeepers, pubs bars you name it. If they also want to decrease their level of savings, they'll have to repeat this until ultimately the funds settle with someone that's content to have their savings increase, offsetting the reduction in your level of savings.
In aggregate, we are (mostly) not in control of our level of savings. As another example - look to the Euro zone. There, nearly every business/government/individual is trying to save, as they think they'll need more Euros for the future or they need to pay back debt. What do you see? A heap of entities that have been unable to reach that goal. Governments, millions of unemployed people - these are all entities losing their savings (/increasing debt), all because others are increasing theirs. ie Germany, running a strong trade surplus but in doing so draining other nations of Euros.
So we are not, in aggregate, in control of our level of savings. Deciding to save then does not lead to increased investment, it in fact just leads to Keynes's paradox of thrift and increased unemployment.
What about investment though? Clearly, any credit-worthy business that wants to invest can go to a bank and borrow money. As banks are not reserve constrained, this is not dependent on savings (I'm happy to go into this if you like). They then buy a new robot for their factory floor, and what have they done? Invested - and created money in doing so. They've created $1mn by investing $1mn in a robot for the factory floor. This $1mn that they've spent has ended up on the robot manufacturer's bottom line as income. Ultimately, that $1mn is going to flow around until it's saved away - meaning that this investment decision has lead to an increase in savings in the economy. Investment drives savings, not the other way around.
The above is as succinct as I can summarise [Savings is the accounting record of investment]( by Moore.
So yes, investment = savings, but they still mean different things. We cannot, in aggregate, decide to lift our savings. Trying to do so just means a collapse of production. We *can* in aggregate decide to lift investment though - firms will do this when there's sufficient demand for them to do so. This increases our wealth and our real production capacity.

I'd argue that Treasury Notes will at all times go for the lowest interest rate loaning attainable in USD, which yes, is a rate set by the Fed. I don't believe QE comes into it - if the Fed stopped QE tomorrow, Treasury Notes (eg short term bonds) will still trade for ~0.25%, the risk-free rate.

Firstly I apologise for the absurd length of this.


They're right on that point. The total amount of money out there is the total amount everyone has spent more than they've received, ie is a form of debt. When you take on debt, you're creating more money. Pay back debt, you're destroying money.
You can see this straight on the bank's books - when they give you a loan, they're legally allowed to mark up your account as having X new dollars (the loan) which is balanced by the bank's liabilities increasing by an equal amount. When you spend that loan and it pops up in another bank, the receiving bank now has a surplus of X dollars and you/your bank owes X dollars. Through the interbank lending markets your bank borrows back from the surplus bank enough to cover its reserve position, ending the money creation process. Pay back your debt and the reverse happens - money is destroyed. The same happens when the government runs surpluses - surpluses destroy money (well, destroy paper wealth in the form of bonds at least), deficits add.
This is a large part of what gives money worth - if you have $5, it means the rest of the economy owes you $5 worth of *stuff*. It's redeemable for stuff as that money was created by people/institutions etc borrowing, money they now owe, money you now own. They'll offer you *stuff* in an attempt to get that $5 back that they need to pay back their debt.
I say "a large part of what gives money worth" because taxes are the other part - as long as the US can enforce taxes in the currency it issues, you will seek out its currency - regardless of how you choose to store your wealth in-between visits from the IRS. This is the government levying a tax against you, giving you a debt that you need to repay (to stay out of jail or keep assets), so really it's just another example that what gives money worth is debt.
Before the government levies this tax outstanding bonds are of course "government debt", and makes up our savings. That is, if all money is debt, and you divide the economy into three sectors (private, public, foreign), private sector savings = public sector debt + foreign sector debt. If the foreign sector has a lot of savings in USD (as a reserve currency, it does), then either the private sector is in a lot of net debt or the public sector is.
In the case of the US it's the public sector with a lot of net debt, providing both the private and foreign sector with positive net savings. Your bank, your pension fund, China and other nations saving in USD - they're all holding our bonds, our government's debt, as USD savings.
Fortunately the government can sustain huge debt because the Fed would sooner print than allow the US to collapse, making its debt as safe as money itself - a belief that doesn't hold for individual countries under the Euro. Hence Europe can't allow high government debt, they attempt to force it down - meaning that households end up short of the savings they desire. The paradox of thrift sets in leading to shocking levels of unemployment, etc etc, all for a shortage of money/spending/savings, whatever you want to call it.
This system only works provided you allow your government to accrue debt. The UK's struggling economy, the Euro zone - all problems created by limiting how much debt government's can accrue. The latter, they don't have much choice, for their choice of monetary system. The former is just misguided. It's lucky Japan did not take the same approach as the UK - it's natural for a risk adverse aging population to desire high savings - savings the Japanese government continues to provide. Whilst they've been losing productivity (a side effect of an aging population), they have at least not suffered a jobs crisis on top of that.


We don't allow it to do that. The government has to sell bonds, assets or levy taxes to raise revenue, banks are only allowed to create money by loaning to people, and the Fed is only allowed to turn paper wealth representing debt into money (which is also paper wealth). If the latter does not change interest rates, not much at all happens (ie QE), for it does not lead to higher spending.
Well, that's not complete, we also allow the Fed to purchase foreign currencies or gold - which *could* make for more jobs. The former would create export jobs, the latter jobs mining gold + the associated multiplier from both (ie exporters spend their money in our economy, as do people selling gold). Both are far from ideal - the former is selling USD to foreigners below cost to have them employ our export sector and take their produce, the latter does the same with gold sellers - in each case the recipients of the Fed's purchasing stand to gain from being the gatekeepers to "new money". Unfortunately, those are the only options we've allowed ourselves.
But obviously these are just self-imposed restrictions. Many believe that removing concerns over public debt by allowing the government (or the Fed) to employ people directly with new money would be [the best option]( in this crisis.
Beyond that, some economists believe we can always print money instead of bonds ([MMTers]( that if we can print one form of paper wealth we can print the other too, provided we either still adjust interest rates (ie by offering interest on reserves) or adjust the overall deficit such that low interest rates are not proving inflationary. Oh, and of course many believe that we can never print money. When questioned how the Fed's managing to monetize debt far faster than it's being created the answer tends to be "wait, you'll see".
I do agree that the concept of the US running out of USD is an absurd concept. Or, as David Cameron would currently have you believe, the UK running out of British Pounds. It all dates back to the gold standard where a country genuinely *could* run out of money, much like one could on Bitcoin.
We ended convertibility just 40 odd years ago, but didn't change much of how our monetary systems and governments operate when we did so. We still haven't changed much, the government still has to sell bonds to borrow the money we create by taking on debt, deleveraging leads to money/spending shortages, etc. Imo, if there's just one good thing out of the GFC and the Euro crisis it's that it's lead to a questioning of this system.

Your nation made the mistake of losing monetary sovereignty and chose to join a currency completely out of your government's control - the Euro. This has carried severe consequences to the nation's economy - over the coming years it's going go [backwards like Greece (or worse)]( but you believe the solution is to move to a currency that your government would have even *less* control over?
If you want jobs, if you want incomes, you need to ensure spending is always high enough for everyone to have an income. Bitcoin can no more offer you that as a guarantee than the Euro - and in many ways it'd be worse. Whilst I feel your pain - if you want a strong future you should bring back the pound. Not just move to yet another currency you have no control over.

You are right that monetary policy is not the be-all end-all when it comes to inflation. You forget the other way to stop it though, reduce the deficit or even run a surplus.
There's literally no amount of inflation that cannot be stopped with higher taxes. There's also no amount of unemployment that cannot be solved without more spending on labor-limited goods and services.
If spending in the economy has exceeded what the economy can support and prices are starting to rise instead of output, simply raise taxes, reducing the buying power of consumers such that spending falls to a level the economy *can* support. Automatic stabilisers do this largely automatically.


It's not true at all that the only thing giving fiat currency value is "faith". The government's fiat currency is the **only** thing that can extinguish your tax obligations and to pay for those debt repayments we all have to make to keep our collateral.
There's just nothing faith based about the value of the dollar - if the government were to find inflation a concern, it could stop it in a heartbeat by implementing a high land value tax. Anyone that doesn't pay the tax loses the ownership of their land, forfeits it to the government. How could anyone describe the rush to acquire USD that this would cause an act of "faith"? The tax removes money from circulation, reduces buying power, inflation is stopped in its tracks.

If they're merely using it as a payment mechanism, ie buying bitcoin to transfer it to someone who will sell it, it does nothing. It's then just a buy order and a sell order at the current market rates, they cancel out.
For Bitcoin to be valuable - people have to want to hold it.
@_date: 2013-02-18 09:19:22


Only if it could reliably store that wealth. Merely being limited in supply does not guarantee that - Litecoin and any number of Bitcoin clones are just as guaranteed, but going nowhere.
For Bitcoin to reliably hold its value, you really need an economy to form around it - with people not speculating, but just holding their money with it because it's the common currency that business transacts in. If it turns out that such an economy could not smoothly function it won't stay in that state for long, and then your wealth is lost.


Not at all. The number of different ways a non-coercive money supply could be implemented are basically infinite.
A Bitcoin clone could be made where the money supply grows perpetually at a rate of 3%/yr. This would allow for some real GDP growth with price stability. A Bitcoin clone could be made that continuously deflated - one that destroys half of all transaction fees would do this. This would cause deflationary prices even with zero real GDP growth. Every single system would grant different spending patterns, different consumption patterns, and different levels of employment.
Why wouldn't people voluntarily prefer to hold their wealth in a continuously deflating Bitcoin clone? Because, once again, it'd only have value if an economy forms around it, and people know that. People would reason that a deflating money supply would be bad, that it wouldn't make the basis for a decent economy, and that it'd never happen. No government in their right mind would tax in it, it'd never take off.
Now I reason just the same way about a static Bitcoin - I feel price stability is a pretty important attribute of money for business, and I feel that Bitcoin will not stand on its own as the foundation of any major economy *ever*. That its niche is informal trading places, and as a means to transfer fiat from a-&gt;b. Neither guarantees investors a return on their holding of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-17 09:10:33


Did you just bring out the "job creators" argument? No business in their right mind expands if there isn't demand for it, if your theory had any merit Greece would be booming right now - there household mortgage interest rates are &lt; 4%. Greece is merely what happens when even a 0% prime interest rate is too high to get entrepreneurs to borrow, and under Bitcoin I'd expect no different. Low interest rates are far from a guarantee of high borrowing.
My mind actually hurts trying to wrap around what you are saying. First off, the economy is booming - 95% of labor is employed, all is well. It's producing all it can, and therefore consuming all it can. Then a crisis hits, people start saving. At *some* point in the future it's reasoned that consumption will return to prior levels, as those savings are once again spent. But hang on, if we could previously produce all that was being demanded - why do businesses expand now? When demand for their goods/services is low? Does your place of work find the best time to take out a loan to expand is when you already have excess capacity to produce? I find that hard to believe.
But then you've gone further and said that there'll be "increased future consumption", that these savers will spend *even more* than they saved.. for some reason. Presumably because they're getting interest on their savings (how? from those businesses borrowing?). So due to the expectations for increased future consumption, businesses go full throttle ramping up production far in excess of current demand. All because they reason that one day those savings, that are providing them with the loans they are using to produce what isn't being demanded, will return to circulation *with interest*.
This, to me, is not a coherent argument. Not to mention that real interest rates on Bitcoin are going to be heavily affected by deflation (which increases the real rate of interest), which *increases* in recessions.

And what if some kind of shock - chance of war or famine perhaps - leads to everyone trying to save at once? Then spending dries up, unemployment rises and real wealth production stops, or at least slows. The resulting loss of output and incomes leads to more people trying to save, and you soon end up looking like Greece. Losing massive amounts of potential output, all for a shortage of spending.
Bitcoin has no measures to prevent this. Any time everyone tries to save at once due to an external shock, real output will decline. Jobs *will* be lost. There's just no two ways about it.

Your income is another person's spending.
Deflation is like having high interest rates. It encourages people not to spend, and especially not to borrow. To save money (in deflationary currencies, perhaps even in a safe at home), so that they can purchase even more with it tomorrow.
This means that there's less spending in the economy, which means less income, which means fewer jobs and lower real wealth generation (ie output etc).
That's where the concern about deflation comes from - if people would prefer to sit on the currency than spend it, and if nobody has any tool to disincentivise that behaviour and it is not self-regulating in some manner, then we may see a collapse in real standards of living all for our choice of what to call "money".

@_date: 2013-02-23 07:08:43


I agree with this, *some* spending will occur. But what's to say that this level of spending will be anywhere near what is required for high employment?
Remember - it's *production* that creates wealth, that improves standards of living. If we're not producing all we can, if we have a heap of people unemployed due to people not spending, we're sacrificing real wealth today for imagined monetary gains. If people are hoarding leading to high unemployment, this costs us more wealth in real terms than anything else. You see today in Greece/Spain what a spending crisis looks like to the "wealth" of its citizens - [it's sickening](
At that, unless someone can show me that BTC would somehow lead to high employment.. I don't want to see it adopted. I'd much rather have fiat, that encourages spending, work and real wealth production, than a deflationary currency that discourages actually producing.


The real rate of interest is still at the very minimum the negative of the deflation in prices, and again, I have no reason to believe that this level of borrowing/spending will correlate to high employment.
Without that guarantee, I wouldn't like to see it adopted.


Paradox of thrift. If everyone tries to save at once, spending collapses, average incomes fall, unemployment rises. Again, I see no reason to believe that BTC would be immune from this problem.
It doesn't matter how big a fishing boat you buy - for you to acquire savings by selling fish you must find someone else willing to part with those savings. Fiat promises slight year-on-year inflation, discouraging hoarding - encouraging spending, encouraging income earning, creating employment. We control interest rates to control spending and (until recently) keep it consistent with what the economy can support, keeping employment high. It's a far from perfect system, broken down as of late due to an unforeseen set of circumstances that even 0% rates are too high for full employment - a problem that really should be tackled by fixing our monetary system but I suppose that's too big for politicians to touch today.
BTC promises year-on-year deflation, encouraging hoarding, discouraging spending, discouraging income earning, reducing employment opportunities and there's no ability to alter interest rates to keep them consistent with high employment.


If speculators drive the price up, it becomes harder for people in Nauru to acquire more BTC. If a savings drive takes hold, employment drops, and those unemployed - with no savings in BTC - have immense difficulty at acquiring any more from foreigners.
They have to somehow generate $100 worth of exports to send off-shore just to acquire one more BTC. This makes it harder for them to acquire more BTC to get out of a savings glut.. again, like Greece today. Sharing a currency with Germany means that those without jobs find it immensely difficult to acquire more of it through their export industry, for the price of one unit of currency is fixed outside of their control - by Germany's export sector, rather than changing with market supply/demand for their own imports/exports. Greeks need to wait for [*internal devaluation*]( which takes a lot of time - that is, they need to wait until they all value the currency less, are willing to work on lower wages etc. A BTC using country would experience the same thing. The BTC is priced outside of their control and so recessions are protracted, with extremely painful internal devaluation being the only way out.


Now you're just talking about getting an entire country to speculate on the future of Bitcoin and hope for the best. You'd have as much luck selling me that argument as you would if you were telling them to base their currency around Apple shares.

*Just buy dollars*? Come on, you're smarter than that. For people to be able to "just buy dollars", there must be a sufficient number of people working those government jobs to supply them to the forex/BTC markets. Yet you then say:


Which doesn't add up at all. No, people will work happily for those government jobs denominated in USD because there's all those people looking to "just buy dollars". They're the ones supplying it for those buying it.
At this, the government can be as big or as little as it likes [tax a lot, spend a lot = big government], [tax a little, spend a little = small government], either way as long as it has the power to enforce taxes/seize property people will work for its currency and its currency will have value on forex/BTC markets.


How has this sudden surplus of dollars such that everybody can afford their mortgages come about?
Money is created through debt. There simply can't be a situation where everyone has enough to pay back their debt + interest to keep their collateral that being the case, not outside of the government running a huge deficit. And even if a deficit *is* proving inflationary, the government can reverse that and make its dollars scarcer by running a surplus. The only way I can see the currency becoming worthless as you suppose is if it's via a government lead deficit, and this is assuming that the government takes no measures to correct this before it is dumped. Oh, that and/or an output collapse - ie if we suddenly stopped receiving oil. That being the case though, all the BTC in the world isn't going to help you..

I do personally agree that having real interest rates negative is bad policy, as are real positive interest rates for risk-free debt as that's giving people money for merely having money (not unlike deflationary currencies..).
Personally, I'd keep interest rates around the rate of inflation, real zero, and use fiscal policy with an emphasis on automatic stabilises and [price anchors]( to manage demand in the economy.. but even that isn't an option under a fixed money supply.
Bitcoin removes monetary policy whilst simultaneously nerfing fiscal policy. It doesn't offer any "automatic" features to regulate demand.. I do not believe it'd lead to prosperous society. It definitely has uses online, is a fascinating invention, but it's not one that should be used to run a country's economy.

The entire basis of our current monetary system is around the fact that interest rates massively affect spending and therefore employment. This isn't a disputed fact among economists.
In Bitcoin, real interest rates are outside of anyone's control - at an absolute minimum, they're the negative of the rate prices are falling.
Today, interest rates are at zero and there's *still* insufficient borrowing/spending for high employment. Under Bitcoin real interest rates would be well above zero today, as real GDP is climbing (al beit slowly), making the employment situation worse than what we see today.
Other than that, I agree with much of what you said - including that real wealth can be created without employment (ie robots making cars) and that not all employment creates real wealth (ie hole-diggers)... although I'd argue that paying someone to do the latter may lead to higher productive work of course.
Personally, I'm completely unconvinced by the argument that Bitcoin wouldn't hurt us and so I still don't want to see it adopted - I believe you're similarly fixed in position - so with that stand-off, let's revisit this debate when/if we have some empirical evidence to review :).

Even then, central banks can't go too far as once customers start noticing that their banks are charging them interest on their savings account, people will just withdraw cash and keep it in their own safes instead.
This is all nominally of course, in real terms interest rates can be negative in a currency that is inflating. A BTC future does not support that either though. For good or for bad, it's just not a currency built for lending.

Not at all. Deficits **add** to our buying power, they do not remove from it. Walk through it:
1. We start off with $10tn in NFA.
2. The government decides to run a $1tn deficit - that is, spend $1tn it does not have.
3. The government prints $1tn worth of bonds and sells them to us. Our NFA has not yet changed, we swapped cash for bonds.
4. The government runs the deficit, spending the money it raised at auction.
5. We have received back the $1tn we spent auction in the form of government expenditure, but still have the bonds we purchased. We are now at $11tn in NFA in total. The government's deficit added $1tn of new financial assets to our paper wealth.
6. Repeat ad infinitum. No money is used up, deficits merely add to our paper wealth.
Not much at all changes if you replace "prints $1tn worth of bonds" with "prints $1tn worth of cash". Both ways, after the deficit we have $1tn worth of new paper.
Bonds are one of the most liquid assets one can own other than cash itself, they do not prevent anyone from spending in the slightest. You can borrow against them, you can sell them - the difference between owning $1mn of bonds and $1mn of cash is pretty much negligable when it comes to your buying power. Deficits we are used to were funded by the former method (primarily for historical reasons, because under convertibility - where money was outside of the government's control, bonds *had* to be issued to raise gold-backed money), but not much at all would change if they simply swapped over to printing to fund deficits.. as they largely have as of late.

I was curious about one other scenario - as the block reward continues halving, could we expect it to get *cheaper*?
For that I figure today there's [~60k transactions per day]( an average of ~415 per block. Currently miners are receiving 25BTC per block, or ~$1.20 per transaction processed.
To maintain the current mining pool (and their power/capital requirements) by the time the block reward is insignificant we'd need some 24 times the number of transactions per day as we have today, assuming a ~$0.05 USD transaction fee. Ideally we'd want a far larger pool, at least 1000 times the size, to make a 51% attack hard for even a government from achieving ($10bn to $50bn).
So if we can get the transactions to ~1500k per day, with an average transaction fee of 5c US per transaction, it ought to be safe from attack even once the block reward has gone. If Bitcoin has *not* reached that critical mass by then, it would be vulnerable to attack.
This is assuming I haven't misstepped in my calculations there..

What advantages would Bitcoin have over say, the USD?
Currently Zimbabwe is using the latter, although it's lead to a money/spending shortage and extremely high unemployment. There's just no way for the government to ensure that there's enough USD in circulation for even a few to have a job, the exact same problem it'd have with Bitcoin.
What Zimbabwe needs is to bring back the ZWL. This time, if the government decides to destroy agricultural output through land reforms once again (which is what started the hyperinflationary spiral) they ought withdraw money from circulation at high rates via surpluses. This time, the government ought borrow only ZWL, and not USD - doing the latter exasperated the hyperinflationary spiral and ultimately lead to the destruction of the currency. Not being able to make USD repayments to the IMF Mugabe printed 22.5tn ZWL to buy as much USD as he could at a time when extremely high inflation was already a problem, such a massive deficit (ie spending more than the government takes in) is the exact *opposite* of what must be done during an hyperinflationary crisis. The rest is history.
Why ZWL and not Bitcoin? Because the former the government can run deficits in, ensuring that it puts enough money into the economy that everyone can pay their taxes (description on why this is vital [here]( The latter has the same problem as the USD, what they're currently trying to use to shockingly bad results - continual deficits are impossible, the government cannot spend enough to ensure that everyone can pay their taxes and have enough left over to buy goods/services from the economy.

Whilst I feel for your pain there - you seem to be confusing a few different things in your response.
Even official CPI-adjusted median household wage figures paint a bleak figure for wealth distribution in the US, which seems to be your main criticism.
The thing is though, GDP is the nation's total production. Back in the 80s the US was barely 220mn people - now over 300mn - but gold argues despite this population increase that we're now *producing* less than before. Does that sound realistic? That the USA was producing more goods/services in the 80s than now?
Your own comment even describes how you/everyone else has to work more hours, producing more goods/services to be able to afford the same amount of time off work. Assuming you're as efficient a worker as your parents generation (ie that technology hasn't gone backwards) this alone ought imply that we're producing more than we used to. Higher population, more men and especially women working more hours at least as efficiently as their prior generation (and one would think so with modern technology!) *has to* mean more real GDP. There's just no two ways about it, yet comparing gold to GDP makes it look like production has gone backwards. That's just crazy talk.
Again, the real concern you seem to have is over wages and wealth distribution. That's a whole different kettle of fish.
I'll quickly address your other mixed concerns (non-GDP related, which is what my post was addressing)


The US is in no more danger of defaulting than Australia, the UK, Singapore or Japan. No country has ever been made to default on debt denominated in the free-floating currency it issues - it just doesn't happen, nor has there ever been a hyperinflationary episode because of that debt. You're speaking of a hypothetical scenario here that has never before happened, that the US will be the first country ever to run out of the currency it issues. It's an absurd notion.
Yes, the US runs continual deficits. The thing is, in a debt based monetary system the US's debt = our savings. That is, if you agree that fiat money is debt - that it's created by people borrowing money - then the only way we can, in aggregate, accrue savings is by putting the government into debt. So we do. The government's debt it our savings - don't worry about it. You can see it right there on  under the green "household assets" column.


Much of Europe has decided to borrow in a currency none of them individually can control. If you borrow in a currency that you do not control you can not assure borrowers that you can pay them back. Accordingly, bond yields may spike. See also every third world nation that the IMF has lent US dollars and then forced into austerity when they couldn't pay them back.
The thing is, US/Singapore/UK/Japan/Australia/Canada etc borrow only in currencies they *do* control, and accordingly have never seen bond markets move against them, no matter how outrageous their debt is, because they know that there's no safer person/business/entity that they can ever lend their currency to than the government that issues it.


This really is much of the problem. Liability on labor *is* reducing, meaning that we now have an oversupply of labor. If you have an oversupply of something, the price falls - hence your complaints about the price of labor falling. When we're all underbidding one another and machines for a shortage of jobs, the price of labor can *only* go down. There are many possible solutions to this, but all of the ones I know involve government intervention, sorry anarcho-capitalists.
My personal favorite is a [job guarantee]( as it ensures that there's never an over supply of labor along with many other advantages (including, in the preferred implementation by a few of its supporters, an end of price inflation - anchoring prices to the price of unskilled labor, instead of aiming to make a basket of goods increase in price). In effect a "labor standard" system, where one unit of currency always buys the same amount of unskilled labor as it used to, regardless of the time period that has elapsed in between. I go into the advantages of that system [here]( - it's far and away my preferred alternate monetary system.

That is, if you wouldn't buy in at $15, you logically shouldn't hold either.

Not true at all - taxes are one of the main things that give fiat currency worth.
As long as taxes are denominated in USD, as long as they're required for you to own property and/or stay out of jail, you and every other American *will* seek USD out.
The power to print money is worthless unless people need your currency, making taxes far more important than the printing press. You tax people in the currency, some will work directly for you, the rest will form a private sector trading with your public sector workers. The economy takes off, all based around an currency rooted in the need to pay taxes.
This isn't just theory either - it's the basis of how currencies were spread to colonies. Native Africans did not care that the British currencies were backed by metals the British claimed were rare, what made them seek out the currency was that it was the only way they could keep their [huts]( That they were backed by limited metals was completely irrelevant.
This is were Bitcoin is quite unique. Regular fiat currencies are backed by a) taxes and b) the collateral someone puts up to create more. Those are two real needs for the USD that no other currency can solve - if you've created USD through borrowing, you *must* seek USD out. If you're an American citizen with USD denominated taxes, you *must* seek USD out. Bitcoin though.. it's entirely optional whether you buy some or not. It's more like a easily transferrable commodity than money as we know it.

There's no inflation that needs curbing today, so what makes you think it'd require "drastic tax hikes or cuts"? In fact, quite the opposite, there's heaps of idle labor - the economy could support a whole heap more spending. Hence the low interest rates you see today, the Fed's trying to encourage all the spending it can, however monetary policy ran out of useful tools long ago.


So if I told you and everyone else that the only way you can keep your house is if you can hand me, the government, $10,000 so that I can remove it from circulation.. it'd still be a matter of "faith"? How can that be? Where does all this money come from in hyperinflation such that higher taxes cannot remove it? Why does nobody care that if they don't hand over money to me that they'll lose their house? How is this "faith"?


I suggest you look more closely at those cases. Weimar and Zimbabwe both suffered huge supply side shocks to their economy whilst their governments ran *massive* deficits - Argentina's was a simple case of massive government deficits.
If the government's going to spend more than the economy can support, prices are going to rise instead of output.  Now my solution to all three of these is simply: "cut the deficit and/or run a surplus, removing money" - you're trying to argue though that this wouldn't have any effect? That it's all a matter of "faith", and that the government simply can't remove money faster than it's being created.. created how? Where's this money coming from, and why would higher taxes or reduced spending not restore order?

The number of Bitcoins mined is independent of the time spent mining. It's a fixed mine rate, divided between all miners with more miners just meaning less BTC mined each.
That is, under the gold standard when a deflationary money(/spending) shortage presents, more people run to the hills and mine. They increase the rate at which money is created offsetting the deflationary pressure and the money shortage resolves itself. The price of labor is floored by the rate at which labor can mine more gold and turn it into money. ie if the average unskilled person can mine gold at $1/hr, wages can never fall below that.
Under Bitcoin, there is no built in mechanism putting a cap on deflation. More people can try buying computers/electricity to mine as it's going up in value, but this does not increase the rate at which Bitcoin is mined - it just splits the constant rate between more miners.

That is just ignorant. Austerity measures in Greece [are extreme]( to the point of [increasing suicide rates]( and a healthcare system that struggles to provide basic care.
Yes, they're still running deficits. This is completely understandable if you're just willing to look macro, and it's nothing to do with lack of cuts.
Euros, like Bitcoins (after mining is complete at least) are a zero sum game. If you're saving Euros, someone else is dissaving Euros.
Not every nation can bring in more Euros from outside their nation - that's mercantilism, and it's impossible in aggregate. Those with the most competitive export sectors may be able to (ie Germany), but if they succeed another less competitive nation must be losing Euros. So at best, Greece/Spain can run a neutral balance of trade.
So you have a neutral foreign sector, with the two remaining sectors - private/public - both trying to save in Euros. One of those sectors is composed of millions of individuals each with their own budgets and, for those with secure jobs at least, great control over whether they're net saving or net dissaving. The other has much of its budget dictated to it via automatic stabilisers.
It's obvious which will tend to win in the tug of war over which sector gets to save Euros and which gets to net dissave when you have (at best) a neutral balance of trade, and that's going to be the private sector.. leaving the public sector with a deficit.
So yes, they're still running deficits but it's not due to not being austere enough. It's simply because it's the only way the accounting can work out - it's impossible for all three sectors to save at once (as foreign sector surplus + public sector surplus + private sector surplus = 0), and so when you are unable to run a trade surplus (and some nations always will be unable to, see [mercantilism]( and your private sector is trying to save you will tend to see public sector deficits despite even harsh austerity.


As you should, it's important that we are talking the same language.


And this is where the Austrian school loses me. Yes, interest rates are a major determinant of all spending and investment in the economy. The problem is, there's *no natural rate of interest*. Interest rates are always going to be a function of what you choose to call "money" - a gradually decreasing money supply (oil based money) would have higher real rates than fixed (Bitcoin) than gradually increasing (gold) than bank created money with the government simply printing its deficits (0% nominal at all times).. and no one seems to be able to justify why their "choice" of money supply, a choice which locks in interest rates for as long as they don't change that choice (as we did on gold when it became constraining) is "ideal". Why their choice would lead to lower unemployment and/or higher production then an alternate choice.
The answer is always the same: "I don't know the answer, let the market decide what to call money". It's very idealistic to think that "the market" can solve for that (historically the market has collapsed into [barter and informal currencies such as rice]( but anyway - what do you tax in in the meantime? What do you pay your government employees in? Inevitably the government's going to have to choose a currency, and the moment they do "the market"'s no longer deciding what to call money. The government's done it for them.


Greece has well over a million unemployed people that would be capable of offering any number of services to those that are employed, from unskilled housecleaning/cooking/what-have-you through to far higher skills, but they can't work because nobody's willing to dissave to provide them with an income. This is what economists mean by "demand", it's not that people *don't want* more goods/services, it's that for whatever reason they're not willing to spend to get it. Bleak outlooks for the future, real interest rates too high, etc.
One of the most important things, that too few understand, is that for you to acquire savings someone must be dissaving. If outlooks for the future are so bad that no one's willing to dissave, you're going to end up unemployed no matter what goods/services that you can offer the world. This is what a shortage of money does - if your currency is one where the amount in circulation can collapse, you're going to end up with people sitting idle despite a lot to offer the world.
The EMU is a great example of how not to run a monetary system, it's more or less the gold standard as implemented in fiat.
Bitcoin would have all the same problems.
If a savings drive ever took across a Bitcoin union, you'd run into all the exact same problems. Those nations with strong export sectors would acquire Bitcoins, those with weak would lose them. Those governments would have bond markets move against them for fear they can't afford their Bitcoin-denominated debt, so they'd lift taxes and cut spending. Households with secure jobs would do their best to save due to a bleak outlook, withdrawing spending from the economy - leading to those with less secure jobs losing their source of income entirely. The government would be forced into deficits despite its austerity measures, which'll start the vicious cycle we see in Greece/Spain today - further cuts would be required, another deficit, further cuts, another deficit, further cuts until the economy and infrastructure's more or less ruined.
Bitcoin/the Austrian school offer no solutions to that problem as I understand them. Austrians just don't look macro enough, they don't seem to realise that it's impossible for everyone to save at once (not that they should feel bad, neither did the designers of the Euro) - and that if they were to ever attempt to, that the economy would collapse.

*That's* where they lost you? Why not the second paragraph:
"Fiat money is money with a government declared value, rather than a natural, inherent value."
The government does not declare the value of the USD, and all attempts at price fixing currencies in law (Bolivar/Argentian Peso/etc) ultimately fail. Yet this guy's making out that the USD has its price fixed by government, when all the government actually says is that $1 is worth 100 cents. That's about as much convertibility as the government offers, with its value actually existing by the fact that the USD is the *sole* thing that can be used to pay US taxes. That's where it gets its value - this unique property about it. Not because the government "says it has value", what rubbish.

It's forkable so far as nations could decide not to sit on billions of it anymore, but being a reserve currency isn't at all required for a currency to have worth. It merely allows you to run continual trade deficits, importing more than you're exporting so that others can acquire your currency and put it in their reserve banks.
It's a non-essential purpose, a luxury position allowing you to consume more imports than you export to pay for them that most nations don't have.
The USD though isn't forkable within the US. As long as the government says that your taxes can only be paid in USD, the currency is not going anywhere and will not be replaced. This is one key difference between the USD and Bitcoin - the USD has zero substitutes for two key functions, paying back USD denominated debt (the same debt that creates the USD in the first place) and paying taxes. Outside of markets Bitcoin has been granted due to first mover advantage (silk road, satoshi, ecommerce) it has infinite substitutability. So whilst I can agree there is a niche for Bitcoin in those markets, I cannot see why nations would ever decide to pump billions into the currency. There's just too much risk of substitution, that their stored "wealth" would end up not being recognised on the world stage.

Personally I believe humans are notice outliers and individual price rises despite the many items that do not increase in price (or get cheaper) and so I really would rather not take any anecdotal evidence of inflation. Show me the stats! And at that, for every shadow stats there is a [Billion Prices Project]( (consistent with CPI) and a [Google Price Index]( (deflation!).. so I don't see much cause for concern. At that, I do believe that inflation is somewhere between 1 and 3%, as that's what the majority of institutions calculate it at.
As for shadowstats ("previous CPI methods") - weightings of CPI from back in the 80s no doubt included *all kinds* of relics such as LP players which no doubt are climbing in price. I don't know how shadowstats generates his numbers despite having looked (it seems to be closed source for some reason), but if he's literally and naively using CPI weightings on a fixed basket of goods from the 80s his measurements are not at all relevant to today.

It's of far more interest to the government to tax you in USD. By requiring you and others to seek out USD and redeem it to own property (or to gain the ability to earn income, etc), the government can print what would otherwise be worthless bits of paper and have people offer the government real goods/services in exchange for them. All for the ability to own land, or gain whatever other goods/services that the government requires the use of its fiat for.
If what you say can't happen ever happen did happen, that the government began taxing in Bitcoin - that's when you'd see it *really* take off.. but you're right, I doubt taxation in Bitcoins will ever be a thing. Far better for government's worldwide to tax in their own fiat currencies to give them worth, to give them power over you ;).

I forgot to credit [this]( thread, which is the one that got me thinking.
There, one solution proposed was the mistaken one of "that's ok, we'll have negative interest loans" - and nobody called them out on it. It's mistaken because no lender in their right mind would lend out a negative interest loan when they can simply hold onto BTC, and retain full value.
Which means at all times we are stuck with interest rates that are even higher than the rate that prices are deflating. Which means only high return loans are possible. Spending is obviously the same story - you only ever spend if the return from that spend is higher than the currency is deflating.
It's a real mess, considering that we need spending if we want production.

Bitcoin is not undergoing QE.
QE is specifically a swap, not changing the net financial assets of anyone. Mining is a net financial asset *gain*, where you are gifted 2500mn satoshi by the system. This would be like if the Fed was gifting the banks $85bn a month without simultaneously taking $85bn a month worth of bonds off them.
Sorry if it seems like I'm nitpicking, but the difference is very important. One is inflationary (mining), the other is not (QE).

Debt can be created in any currency, but the difference is that every single USD out there is backed by debt.
Every single dollar is owed by someone, to someone. This ensures that they all have value. If you have net savings of $5, someone somewhere is down $5. They need to offer you $5 worth of *stuff* so that they can pay that debt back as it falls due.
This is different to say, Feathercoins. There, they're created just by mining. There's nothing to say that a Feathercoin will continue to be wanted by anyone. One day, very likely, they'll just be "there" - unwanted, discarded, assigned to long forgotten wallets.
So whilst yes, if we all decided to start borrowing Feathercoins it'd hold the value up until we stopped doing that.. but that doesn't keep demand for them permanently up like it does the USD where every single one in circulation is backed by debt, and where we borrow them because they're widely accepted due to being the only money that can extinguish US tax obligations.

Sure, there's the argument of "only gamble what you can afford to lose", perhaps you can't afford to buy in any more, but you weren't arguing along those lines.

But this is where I've been taking real issue with your stance from the start.
The real rate of interest, that price signal, entirely comes from your arbitrary choice of monetary system. There's nothing natural about it. A money supply that decreases in supply by 5% per year will give a very different "price signal" on interest than one that increases in supply by 5% per year. One can not simultaneously advocate for both a gold/silver standard and a completely fixed money supply, for they'd yield two completely different economies with different levels of employment and consumption.
Why is it that you believe that a fixed supply of money would yield a highly employed productive society over a money supply that increased/decreased by X% per year? Why do you believe your arbitrary choice over money supply growth would yield a more efficient economy over any other?
Until you can explain to me why choosing a money supply that is a fixed supply will yield better results over other alternatives, I really can't begin to accept your theory.

Only if demand is ever-increasing. Just because something is fixed in nature does not mean its value will ever rise, eg despite Feathercoin also being fixed in quantity I doubt anyone expects it to be a completely safe investment.

You're saying that Zimbabwe's currency should be Bitcoin. This is a currency currently outside of the country, meaning that Zimbabwe should sell diamonds and precious resources to import *money*.
Why not instead call something *within* Zimbabwe money, fiat for instance, meaning that foreigners don't profit off Zimbabwe's situation? You are right that using Bitcoin is much of a muchness compared to other foreign currencies, but there are better solutions.
The government can simply start taxing in ZWL, and funding its employees with (extremely cheap to produce) ZWL. Government expenditure then funds taxes, and as long as the deficit is appropriate you can ensure that there is enough money in the economy for full employment but not so much that there is price inflation. Strong automatic stabilisers do this automatically.

I absolutely agree that taxes come first. Debt is merely how we create more of the currency without devaluing it.
I'd also agree that having it created by debt and debt alone is a huge part of the problem today - if demand for credit dries up (equivalently, demand for savings increases) and the government does not fill the hole we end up with unemployment.
I cannot see how Bitcoin offers a better solution though - there if demand for savings increase *nobody* can safely fill the hole left in aggregate demand.
I also never said Bitcoin has no value. I just pointed out that unlike fiat doesn't have taxation and debt underlying it, but rather a few semi-unique properties that it shares with every other cryptocurrency and the liquid market and acceptance that comes with first mover advantage. This, along with speculation on its future, gives it value.

If the Fed then goes along and replaces my bond worth $1000 with $1000 in cash, why do I now suddenly decide to bid up the price of gold when a second ago I was content with sitting on a zero yield bond?

We always in effect fix one good or basket of goods in price. The Fed has chosen to make a basket of common goods/services rise in predictable inflation, and have every other price scale around that basket.
We could, if we wanted to, fix the price of oil and have every other price shifting volatilely around that - but it'd increase the cost of business, and carry psychological effects as your wages are steadily decreased to keep gas constant in price. The majority of businesses aren't using gas as a sole/primary input, far more useful to have labor and general input costs predictable over the cost of gas.
Same with gold. It's useful for extremely little - fixing the price of gold and having everything else vary would just make doing business harder. It'd be a deadweight loss on society, and for what? So that you can point to gold and say "look, it's steady in price"? What good is that if the price of every single other thing, importantly the cost of labor, is shifting dramatically to keep that unuseful price static?

I'm not sure I get you, banks are not tasked with keeping employment high and prices stable, their job is to simply issue loans.
For that, they take the variable risk-free rate (as set by the Fed) that they themselves can borrow at, mark it up for risk + profit, and on sell it to you.
They're not trying to keep prices stable or the economy fully employed, they're just doing their job - lending money. They don't need to lock in rates ahead of time to do that, and where they do (fixed rate loans) they're merely factoring in an additional risk that the risk-free rate may be increased over the term of the loan.

Imagine if hedge funds and speculators were the only ones trading in Bitcoin. If that were the case, it would be completely fair to say it's a Ponzi scheme. The only fiat entering is that from other investors, if they all try to withdraw some would come out ahead (most likely the earliest to enter, earliest to withdraw) whilst others lose everything.
If however the real economy side of it, people using it for goods/services etc, dwarved the speculators - then it would not be a ponzi scheme. It'd then be a legitimate currency. The speculators then are just savers, they can always withdraw as there'd always be other people looking to buy/save in their place for the economy has a large core user base of legitimate users.
So the question "is Bitcoin a sound currency or a ponzi scheme" would be best answered, imo, by "is it mostly speculators or users". At the moment, I would argue it's more on the former hedging on the latter coming about. If the latter never comes, it's a ponzi scheme. If it does come about, it was a sound investment.

This is a common story, particularly along libertarians - but looking at history it seems nearly all major currencies were in fact based [in the state](
The state taxes tokens, tokens it must first spend or loan into existence - the need for these tokens to pay taxes then drives the entire monetary system. When the state's currency breaks down we do in fact tend to devolve into barter, or even rice as a currency - certainly not gold or silver. That's if we're to look at history anyway.

If you want wages to increase you need to first reduce the massive excess supply of labor we have right now. Employers just aren't going to lift wages whilst there's millions unemployed. For that, you need higher deficits.


Once again, I'd rather we did away with the Fed and monetary policy altogether. Have inflation/employment instead handled principally through automatic stabilisers and fiscal policy. But yes, the Fed has not had a perfect run - that I agree with.


The Fed is doing an asset swap. This just is not inflationary, as all evidence shows. You cling to "just wait" and "you'll see", "once it's in the real economy all hell will break lose" - just plain wrong. Japan was doing QE over a decade before USA started, and their problem's always been *deflation*... I'm sorry, but I'm not going to subscribe to unsubstantiated fear-mongering.

Glad you asked! I was a bit roundabout on that in that I carefully it worded it such that all money is "total amount everyone has spent more than they've received".
Essentially only central banks are allowed to create money without creating a liability for themselves, which is why we've placed such tight controls on it in that they can only purchase debt, gold, or foreign currencies. For that I've had to carefully word my reply in terms of spending more than they're taking in, and further down in my reply I end up grouping the central bank in with the government (ie of the three sectors, the central bank is clearly not private or foreign, it's public), yet the central bank can for instance buy gold - introducing USD savings into the system by doing so, at least until it sells that gold.
Whether you're happy to accept that the central banks outstanding money is the government sector's "debt" or not doesn't matter a great deal though - the *vast* majority of money is debt, which is why I did not disagree with the sentiment. If it was all repaid, it'd simply cease to exist except for whatever the central bank has spent on foreign currencies and gold.
If you're willing to accept that the central bank's outstanding money is just another form of public debt, then the simple equation I referred to earlier holds for USD: public sector net savings + private sector net savings + foreign sector net savings = 0. That is, we cannot in aggregate save in the government's currency - one sector's net savings is another sector's net debt, and if all debt was repaid, we'd all have no savings. For Bitcoin a similar equation applies but instead of =0 it's =21mn BTC (less lost coins). An economy built around Bitcoin, despite not being "debt", would be no more immune to money shortages leading to unemployment than fiat currency is when you're trying to force public sector debt to some nominal figure.
If you're not happy with that simplification, it's this: public sector net savings + private sector net savings + foreign sector net savings = central bank's spending on foreign currencies and gold (as it'd no longer hold any public debt or private debt, the only other things it's allowed to hold), but the same conclusion pretty much holds.
I did intend to clarify this but the previous reply was getting a bit unwieldy as it was ;).
EDIT: As for the physical currency, the vast majority would end up back at Federal Reserve Banks. Banks create digital money through loaning, they then buy from reserve banks how much physical currency they think they'll need for their ATMs etc using this digital money. If this digital money was all destroyed by being paid back banks would have to sell a lot of their physical currency, removing it from circulation (read more about how physical currency comes into circulation [here](


Ok, the theory of fractional reserve banking has a concept of "high powered money". That if the government were to create money, banks would multiply it up to 10 times, and that'd be inflationary, which is why we can't have nice things. But if it creates bonds, banks won't multiply them, and it'd not be inflationary.
This takes a very supply sided view to money creation, that loans are (nearly) always limited by the supply of high powered money, and creating more high powered money would always lead to more loans (except for exceptional circumstances such as today, referred to as a [liquidity trap](
An alternative theory is that the number of loans going out is *always* limited by demand by credit-worthy borrowers, and that *that* is limited by interest rates. This is backed by a few recent (just 2010) papers such as [this]( from the Fed and [this]( from the BIS. If this theory is correct, and I believe it to be, then there's no issue with printing money provided you do something to keep the rate of money creation by borrowing and the overall level of spending at a level the economy can support. At that, MMT proponents typically argue for either a) using interest on reserves to establish any floor interest rate the government desires or b) using strong automatic stabilisers to keep the spending at a level the economy can support.
A lot fall in to the second camp, believing we should end the Fed altogether (or at least its interventions in the interbank lending markets) and simply have deficits paid for with "new money" (ie simply crediting accounts without making a liability for the government, much like how the Fed buys gold), with interest rates always sitting at zero (with all deficits being paid for with "new money" we have the equivalent of continual QE, interest rates will never rise). If borrowing picks up we ought reduce government spending, if it ever reduces we ought increase it. Automatic stabilisers (such as income taxation and a [job guarantee]( system) do this completely automatically, and allow us to ensure that all times we're not leaving willing labor idle for a shortage of money.
In theory a job guarantee even promises true price stability - ending the era of continual inflation, as it pegs the price of unskilled labor to a fixed rate. If wage inflation steps in, the money injection from this system falls off, a deflationary pressure - if wage deflation ever steps in money injection increases, entirely automatically. It's very similar to the gold standard, but instead of pegging the currency to gold, we peg the currency to an hour's work of unskilled labor. One unit of currency buys the same amount of unskilled labor after 10 years as it does when the system's first implemented, meaning that despite interest rates now sitting at zero percent permanently due to "printed deficits" savers are not hurt. Their money always buys the same amount of unskilled labor. For this reason it's typically a staple of any MMT'ers redesign of our monetary system - it's a *very* strong automatic stabiliser that serves to peg the currency to labor.
Essentially, they (/I) believe that there's no amount of inflation that reducing overall spending cannot solve, and there's no amount of unemployment that redirecting more spending towards employment cannot solve. Stagflation (ie when oil becomes the limiting factor of production, instead of labor) is solved by a combination of the two - reducing the consumption of oil by raising taxes (ie cutting the deficit), cutting expenditure (ie on oil hungry tanks), or raising interest rates (as this reduces spending by making saving more attractive and borrowing less) to ensure that there's enough oil left over that all labor can once again be employed.


I agree, although personally I'd do away with bonds altogether. There's simpler ways to subsidise savings/make borrowing more expensive than offer bonds - we can simply pay interest on reserves.
You may enjoy [this parable]( on a simplified economy with no banks and a government (actually parents of a household) that simply prints its deficit.

If a bitcoin sits in an account for a whole day and then is spent, it destroys one day.
If a bitcoin sits in an account for half a day and then is spent, it destroys half a day. If it's spent again half a day later, it destroys another half a day. Even if it moves very quickly, one hour in each wallet, a fast moving bitcoin still only destroys one Bitcoin day per day.
If a bitcoin sits in an account for 100 days and then is spent, it destroys 100 days at once.
At that, it attempts to be a measure of hoarding as if you see a spike in Bitcoin days destroyed, it means that a lot of "old money" has started moving.
It's not perfect - it could be gamed by moving your savings from one wallet to another periodically if you want it to appear that there's less hoarding than there actually is, but it's still an interesting measure of activity.

Employment is what generates wealth. A billion man-hours of labor has the potential to produce a whole heap of things, and that's how much we're currently losing to unemployment every two weeks due to a shortage of spending. Real wealth potential, permanently lost to us. Creating more money can solve this, can find those people employment, and in doing so can generate real wealth.
You'd be right that when we're fully employed increasing spending would only be inflationary, today we're nowhere near that point. The economy can absorb a whole heap more spending before prices need increase.


Labor is currently not scarce at all. Any good/service that can be produced by labor is therefore not a scarce resource.


And when I ask for an example of a time when we did not have shortages or surpluses, you're going to apply [no true scotsman]( right?


There's traditional price fixing, ie government mandated prices that inevitably leads to shortages/surpluses, and then there's altering the money supply such that a certain price or basket of prices is relatively constant. The latter certainly can work, it's something we've done since the days of the gold standard.
One way we can keep the unskilled labor wages constant without creating shortages or surpluses is a [job guarantee]( system. Under the gold standard, the government offered to buy any amount of gold for a fixed price - a job guarantee system is the same, but for labor. If you're willing to work for the fixed wage, you're granted a job doing so. Therefore there's no shortage of jobs - it's an open-ended buy order by the government. There's also no shortage of workers to any private firm willing to offer better than the JG's fixed wage or better working conditions. It ensures that at all times there's enough jobs for all people, and in doing so ensures that every willing worker has a wage with which they can demand goods/services from the real economy.


But that's just the problem. There's an insufficient supply of *jobs*. Your solution is have the unskilled race to the bottom, to see who's willing to work for the least amount of money before turning to a more profitable life of crime or welfare cheating. The government's solution to stop that race to the bottom is a price floor, which doesn't solve the jobs shortage - just makes it apparent in unemployment figures. A JG though solves the problem at the root - it ensures that there's enough jobs to go around. It ends the oversupply of labor.
Now your criticism of that will be that they're make-work - but we don't know that. Until the unemployed have a living wage and are having their demands for essential goods/services being met, we can't be sure that there isn't enough work to go around. All we know is that right now, when the economy's not producing enough to grant every one a basic standard of living, that there's not enough jobs to go around.

Nearly a half trillion dollars worth of goods/services a year.
Chemicals, financial services and tourism make up your [3 biggest export industries]( Wikipedia offers a pretty good further breakdown [here](
Basically, everything you import has to be paid for by either an export or by a trade deficit - someone selling you that import merely to acquire your currency, perhaps as a store of wealth or investment. A downgrade possibly makes people more nervous about the latter, shrinking trade deficits (which make up ~$40bn a year), but the main strength of the pound is rooted in your export industry (~$480bn a year).

Why would we ever pay back all government debt? In a debt based monetary system - public debt is *our* savings. We don't *want* the debt to be paid back, ever - we don't want our savings confiscated. The government ought just keep on rolling over, just as it always has. Those assets it's created, those bonds/securities - let's not ever remove them all from circulation. Why should we?


You're a trader. You're smart. Hear me out - if the market assumes that the government would sooner print than default, then the only risk *ever* of lending to the government is inflation right? A risk that is present whether you lend to the government or anyone else - or even if you leave your savings as cash.
At that, over the term of the loan - irrespective of how much debt the government has - if the market assumes that the government would sooner print than default, it will always be guaranteed the lowest rate loaning in the currency it issues. That even 240% of GDP in debt (ie Japan), the government would still be lent money for considerably less than someone chasing a new mortgage - it'd have no difficulty selling newly printed bonds.
So what you're predicting there is not the government finding difficulty borrowing USD - but *everyone*. That all loaning in the currency has ceased up. That if the government's debt gets too high, the Fed will lose control of interest rates on the interbank lending markets, banks will no longer lend out, people will no longer lend out, and the government will no longer be able to issue new bonds for reasonable interest. Just to clarify that that's what you're referring to - a complete collapse of the currency, even though it's only bonds that have been printed.
I do largely agree with this - if the government prints too many bonds, if we attempt to push the economy too far past capacity inflation/hyperinflation may become a real concern. We are so far below capacity at the moment it's not funny though - the economy has huge capacity to absorb more spending before inflation sets in.


The Fed is not increasing our net financial assets, it is merely changing the makeup of them. It's swapping one kind, bonds, with another - cash.
It's government *deficits* that add to our savings - not asset swaps. Irrespective of if the Fed does QE or not, deficits add to our savings. A $1bn deficit *always* adds $1bn worth of net financial assets, and it matters not whether they are in the form of bonds or in cash - our buying power, our ability to bid up prices - is increased by $1bn.
The Fed swapping $1bn worth of bonds with $1bn in cash is *not* increasing our NFA. It's merely changing their makeup.


Deficits absolutely can be inflationary even if they're paid for by bonds. If the government prints several $bn in bonds and uses them to buy up steel, the price of steel will increase - at least until the manufacturers can expand to meet that demand. If we're running at capacity they won't even be able to do that, prices will just have to increase. Likewise if the government decided to buy up low-skilled workers on $50k salaries - this would be very inflationary regardless of whether it's paid for by creating new bonds or new cash.
Don't be fooled - bonds don't put a hold on private sector spending in the slightest. They're liquid high value assets, the buyer of them can exchange them for cash or borrow against them any time they want to spend instead of save. If bond holders were somehow prohibited from being able to exchange bonds for cash or borrow against them you may have a point, but obviously this isn't the case.


We have three main ways of funding a deficit:
1. The government can spend down its savings. A $1bn deficit adds $1bn to circulation. Importantly as the government was accruing these savings, it would have been withdrawing money from circulation - a deflationary pressure. The central bank would have countered this by lowering rates, increasing money creation through loaning, meaning this money the government's now spending has already been replaced in circulation. Spending it then would be every bit as inflationary as printing new money.
2. The government can simply credit accounts, aka print money. A $1bn deficit adds $1bn to circulation - every bit as inflationary as (1).
3. The government can print bonds, sell them, and spend the money it raises. A $1bn deficit adds $1bn in bonds to circulation. There's the same amount of money as before, but now there's a whole heap more of NFA tradeable by the private sector and borrowable against. The buyers of these bonds can convert them to cash virtually on demand, they present little inconvenience to their holders when they desire to spend over save when compared to (1) and (2).
All of these approaches have the capability of being inflationary. If the government adds to our NFA faster than we can expand to meet the extra demand those NFA lead to, inflation will occur. If we have an inflation-targeting central bank (we do), this may present as an interest rate hike instead. But yes, government spending - even if funded by bonds - can absolutely be inflationary.

I would certainly agree that if forking a cryptocurrency was impossible, if there could be only one, gold would be inferior in every way.
Today though, gold offers something that no cryptocurrency can. That it's a truly unique element, of which more cannot be created in any real quantity. Again, if cheap alchemy was discovered or huge reserves were found, it'd be worthless overnight - that's the risk you take.
Bitcoin though, if you wanted within a week you could fork it hundreds of different ways, all with 21mn coins, all with the exact same mining patterns.

Why would a government issue BTC denominated taxes on property values when it could collect them in its own currency?
By taxing in its own currency with penalty of forfeiture for those that don't pay, people have no choice but to seek out that currency if they want to own property. By creating demand for it through taxes, the government can spend its currency in to existence to employ its workers. The private sector trades with the public sector workers for it, and it becomes the dominant currency of trade.
The better question is - why would you use BTC when ultimately you need USD to keep your house?
Even today - if you lose your collateral if you don't acquire enough USD to pay back your loan, then you don't simply "abandon the currency". You'd be abandoning your house in doing so. No. You seek it out, trade your labor for it, all so you can keep that mortgaged property that you've been working towards for so long. I really don't see how you see this "abandoning of the currency" to take place. Sounds outlandish to me.

Actually, you can print money to employ people *without* it being inflationary if output is increasing.
Don't believe me? Take America, now clone it. You've created twice as much money, yet the price level hasn't changed.
The same story happens if you have a heap of unemployed people. Imagine first of all that you have two cities, one with money, one without. One's fully employed, the other has zero employment.
So, print some money and start employing just a few people in the zero employment city. They'll use it to pay their taxes, they may save a bit of it, but for the excess they'll have no use. Other people in that city will need money to pay *their* taxes and stay out of trouble (and to buy imports from the fully employed city), so they'll offer goods/services to the newly employed. A private sector is formed, all due to the public sector employing a few people.
The total effect on the exchange rate of this currency with foreign currencies depends on how much the newly employed import from the outside world vs how much they export, but it need not even have much of a negative effect on that. Long-term, it has gains as the society's now more productive.
This is all well explained in this parable [here](
The problem is, the moment you start choosing a currency outside of anyone's control, one that doesn't even really exist in your nation, you're locking in intractable unemployment. You can end up with money shortages, where after people have paid their taxes, saved the bit they desire, there's none left over for consumption. This means real wealth, what is produced by jobs, isn't generated - all for a shortage of the resource you have decided to call "money". A shortage of something you have invented, to prevent you leveraging what real resources - labour etc - you have available to you. Believe it or not, but the solution to Zimbabwe's problems is to bring back the ZWL.

The real rate of interest is a major determinant at the rate at which you spend. If inflation was 50% you **would** spend money considerably faster than if it was 2% than if it was -50%. This is just irrefutable. To propose the opposite is to say that interest rates affect no decisions, absurd.
Now with Bitcoin the real rate of interest is at a minimum the negative of the deflation rate. I see no reason to believe that that rate would correspond with high employment, and if it does not it prevents real wealth generation.
Yes, computers/electronics sell today despite decreasing in price. This is because to the buyer a purchase today returns higher utility, higher interest, then waiting. If they were deflating even faster, less purchases would be made today. If prices were increasing, far more.

Bitcoin has no real exports. You could argue silk road, but they're priced in fiat, their supply chain requires fiat - they're only using BTC to transfer fiat. This is massively different. It's a buy order of BTC immediately followed by a sell order, it ought be price neutral.

And what advantages does Bitcoin's technical properties have over the infinite number of alternative cryptocurrencies?
That's one thing I don't get - for all the talk about it being ever limited to 21mn BTC, the number of potential forks/clones etc is limitless. Why should Bitcoin have so much value but Litecoin so little? Why should either have value? Is first mover advantage *really* worth a $1bn+ market cap?
Because that's what we're valuing here - not the technical properties, but first mover advantage. And apparently it's worth a heck of a lot, at least assuming it isn't currently in a bubble.

You are right that when output is collapsing the real rate of interest will naturally ease up - and as it's heating up the money supply will automatically put the brakes on further.
The problem is though, I see no reason to believe that this damper would be consistent with the potential for growth of output or full employment. How do we know equilibrium won't be just 80% of our potential? What if we'd need a currency that increases in supply by just 5% per year to have an equilibrium consistent with 100%? What if this is even different from country to country?

You pay with BitPay. BitPay pays the seller in USD and immediately puts up your BTC for sale in USD. You then buy that BTC off them with your USD.
See what you've done there? You've just paid for your own BTC with USD and a seller's walked away with that USD. May as well have paid with USD directly.
And yes, obviously it may not be *you* that ends up purchasing the coins off BitPay, but that's besides the point. In the grand scheme of things it's the same net result - a buy order by you cancelling out a sell order by BitPay.

The US dollar has two main uses unique to it that give it something very akin to "intrinsic value".
Firstly, it is the only thing that can pay off USD denominated debt - the kind of debt people go into to create the USD in the first place. Bitcoin simply *cannot* pay back that debt, you need USD for that, and trying to use Bitcoin to create USD is merely an unsustainable pyramid/ponzi affair. Yet if that debt is not repaid, you lose your collateral - giving people a very real need to seek USD out.
Secondly, the USD is the only thing that can extinguish your US tax obligations. Bitcoin can't do that, you need USD, and just like USD-denominated debt Bitcoin can't help all its users do so. Yet if *that* obligation is unpaid, you potentially end up in jail and/or without assets.. again, giving people a very real need to seek USD out.
Meanwhile what's Bitcoin's intrinsic value over say Litecoin's? The network effect from being the first cryptocurrency? I.. find it hard to get excited over Bitcoin for that.

Thank you.
You can only extract in fiat the fiat that others are putting in. It's impossible for everyone to derive fiat profits in this manner, any more than everyone can come out ahead from a ponzi scheme. If you manage to extract more fiat than you put in, someone else is not going to be able to withdraw as much as they put in for it. Eventually, the buck must stop with people that have bought in but can't find people to sell their BTC for even higher prices to.
What you *can* do with BTC is store BTC denominated wealth - it does this very easily. Buy 1BTC, and it'll still be worth 1BTC in 10yrs time. You can also use it for reasonably anonymous, efficient trade. It's just fiat profits that the majority of people will not be able to pull off.

The "correct" level of spending is one that leads to low unemployment.
If real resources such as labor are going idle due to a shortage of something we have invented - money - it's our monetary system holding back our standard of living for no appreciable gain.


And yet you're seemingly arguing that the best will be returned when the money supply is static. Who are you to say that we won't do better under a money supply that grows at 3% per year, or one that shrinks at 10% per year? How have you come to decide that a static money supply is the optimal money supply?

I don't think anyone in this thread realises this - the Zero Hedge article certainly doesn't point it out - but the Bolivar exchange rate is set by government price controls.
The government publishes what the official rate is, and prohibits exchange for outside of that rate. They had significantly overvalued it, a black market arose as you'd expect, and the "real" exchange rate is far lower than even the price controlled one today is, even after devaluation.
Obviously when the official exchange is so much higher than the black market exchange rate citizens will try to convert via the official channels. They are limited in how much they can do this, with caps of $3000 a year for tourism and $400 a year for internet purchases [(source)]( Nonetheless, even with these controls Venezuala was running out of USD to sell to their citizens below cost. Hence the devaluation of the fixed exchange rate.

Why would the US government change their taxes from being charged in the currency they issue to one they have no control over? Especially after seeing what's happened to Cyprus/Greece/Spain/Ireland etc for them having done that.. it's an incredibly risky move.
The restraints a BTC economy would impose on the government would just be too great - it'd have to drop any desire to ensure that employment is high, it'd no longer be able to ensure any kind of safety net and it'd have to forget about keeping prices stable, and most dangerously - the government's solvency could then be questioned, potentially leading to  Euro zone like disasters where the government cannot afford its debts. Given that it'd lose all those - what does it stand to gain from switching to Bitcoin exactly?

It can simply print more bonds. Due to the owning the printing press the Japanese government is at all times assured the cheapest loaning in yen, a rate the central bank itself sets (for short term debt at least). Therefore they can just keep on issuing short term bonds til the cows come home, there's no need to actually "print money".
Granted yes the central bank effectively does through open market operations, but QE has gone so far beyond what is required to get short term rates down to zero. Even if it stopped printing tomorrow, they're not going to shift for a **very** long time.


Saving in yen is what the Japanese are doing though.
We know this because the government is running a deficit. This means the non-government's receiving more yen from the government than it's paying in taxes, which means they must be putting it aside. If they were not, it would have ended up back with the government. Government deficits are just that - non-government surpluses, meaning that we've put aside money.
When we go on a debt binge, the government runs a surplus (see Clinton years, or Australia up to the GFC), because we're doing just the opposite. We're digging into our savings, taking on debt, doing everything we can to lower our net holdings of the currency : this means a public sector surplus. When we're doing the opposite, we get a public sector deficit. Japan's a risk adverse aging population, of course they're putting aside yen. This means public sector deficits, not that there's anything wrong with that - they're perfectly sustainable due to being denominated in yen.

They'd have a lot of difficulty doing that, as to convert your bolivars you either need to go through the government channels (where the government fixes the exchange rate and allows a limited number of transactions it [deems suitable]( or the black market floating exchange rate, which is far more expensive - 20 bolivar to the USD.
This is what economists mean by the currency was (and *is*) "overvalued" - the value of the currency isn't set by the market, but rather price controls, and as it's way overpriced the government has to ration it off. Now that it's been brought slightly closer in line with the floating price, less rationing is needed, but more adjustments are needed before hopefully allowing the currency to simply go freely floating - if that isn't too much to ask of the socialist government.

Bail-out has come to mean governments or foreign nations giving banks money so that they don't go under. Bail-in is a new term, meaning banks taking money from people's savings so that they don't go under.

It never ceases to surprise me how backwards the American banking system is.
In Australia, most transactions these days can be paid for via paypass/paywave (just tap your card, one second authorisation, no PIN/signature needed for &lt;$100, bank covers fraudulent use) with smart travel cards used for public transport in many cities (tag on/tag off affairs), covering the "quarters on a bus" issue.
Points 2/4/5 are covered by the ease of transferring between accounts via the net or designated phone apps (eg [Kaching]( 4 digit pin is all that's required to make payments, like an ATM) takes a few seconds and is completely free (even between banks) - this is how rent is paid 99% of the time, especially with how easy it is to set up recurring transactions. Between banks does take up to 1 working day however.
That only really leaves point 3.. that via Bitcoin, you can just tell someone your main payment address and anyone can see how much you get paid, how frequently, and to what addresses you move your payments. Personally, I'd rather that this information wasn't so readily available..

So Africa adopted the British currency *not* because of taxation, but because they saw it, and thought it was good? I find that hard to believe.
If I was told the only way I can own land is to pay a land tax in the government's currency, and the government employed some people paying that currency, I would offer those people my goods/services to acquire that currency so that I can own land. Even if that currency was merely fiat! That is how currencies work. That is how they come to be widely used. A government taxes in it, pays people in it, and the market uses it as a result.
At best Bitcoiners can hope for a low use informal economy until the day that a government begins taxing in Bitcoin - if that day should ever come, that economy would be Bitcoinised overnight. If the only way to keep out of trouble is to possess Bitcoin, people will seek out Bitcoin. As long as it's USD that Americans need though, it'll always be just a sideshow. The only exception to that would be if the currency has completely broken down due to hyperinflation by ridiculous government policies, ie Zimbabwe.


*Governments* have traditionally selected gold/silver. Lately they've selected fiat, and that's made a lot of libertarians unhappy, but it doesn't change the fact that it is government selected first, market used second. Well, at least if we are to look to history..


Of course you can run a trade deficit with commodity money. It's merely your country shipping gold/Bitcoin off-shore. It's what drives nations to be mercantile - you know that a dwindling money supply is bad, so there's a big drive for *every* country attempting to export more than they import. All so that they can acquire more "money" that they need to run the economy with. Bitcoin would be no different - it'd lead to mercantilism and/or war.


If the influx of money had never ceased it would have never collapsed. You're right that it was unsustainable, but *only because* they decided to peg their currency to something dug out of the ground of other nations. If it had been government fiat, there'd have been no need for that money shortage to ever have occurred. They could have supplied any amount of money the economy needed.


A level of consumption is only truly unsustainable if it's using up real resources, ie oil.
Here you're talking about it being unsustainable in monetary terms - the only way I can see that happening is if your money supply is based on a real resource, such as Spain earlier. Then you're right, you may find yourself in a situation where continued growth of that money supply is no longer possible. If money doesn't have such arbitrary constraints placed on it it need not lead to such a crisis. The government could always supply as much as the economy, merely by running an appropriate deficit.

Not to mention that fiat is created when people take out loans, and that the only way to pay back that debt is to acquire fiat.

Whilst heralded by sellers, this just moves the risk. Now the risk is with the buyer that the seller may not fulfill his part of the transaction. There's no free lunch.


More accurately there was a shortage of *spending*. Spending = income, and whenever spending is insufficient for labor to be highly employed you're going to end up in a recession.
Under a gold standard, a shortage of money/spending can be countered by more people moving to the hills and mining. Under fiat currency, a shortage of money/spending can be countered by the government increasing its deficit.
Under Bitcoin.. you have to wait for enough deflation to set in that people stop hoarding and start spending once more. This can take *many many years* - if it were a quick process, the Euro zone (where governments cannot run deficits for long, due to money being out of their control) would have recovered long ago.
I'm also really not sure if we ever *could* be highly employed under Bitcoin. People only spend or borrow if their return on that spending is greater than the rate of real interest, to them. We've made this the basis of our fiat money economies today - lowering interest rates when we need more spending, raising them when we have too much.
Under Bitcoin, this is completely out of our control. The real rate of interest is simply the negative of the deflation rate, and the problem I see is that there's no reason to believe that I can see that this real rate of interest will be consistent with full employment. We have nothing like it in history to study, a completely fixed money supply, we have only theories.. but personally, I think it would be a terrible basis for an economy.
The rest of your post I generally agree with. It is more secure, more divisible and easy to send from one side of the world to the other (although it may be hard to turn into fiat at either end).

A deflationary currency is not much different to the central bank setting high interest rates.
If the Fed wanted to, tomorrow it could set interest rates to 50%. This would discourage spending to the extreme, make borrowing very expensive, massively reduce consumption and investment, reduce incomes accordingly (for the total amount being spent = the total amount being received as income), reduce employment, and leave the economy producing a lot less than it is currently.
Yet that's what you advocate - that we make our economy produce less. It's not a goal that's ever occurred to many economists because it just doesn't make any sense. Real wealth is production - jobs create it. Whilst we can offer whatever interest rates we like on our currency, if it's leading to less jobs, we're actually destroying wealth.

If your bank was paying 105% interest p.a., would you not save more and live a very frugal life today?
Because that's the problem, and why a highly deflationary currency would not work. You and everyone else would live *too* frugally, to the extent that there isn't nearly enough work to go around. There'd be a huge number of people *willing* to work, but no one willing to employ them - everyone's saving for the future day when they can buy even more stuff. The economy's left with a huge amount of unrealised potential, all because everyone's saving and nobody's spending.


You know you're gambling on Bitcoin, that it's no sure bet, so you don't mind spending USD. This is different to if Bitcoin actually became a sure bet - at that point you'd be a lot less willing to buy anything but essentials today.
The author's going for [reductio ad absurdum]( He's showing that if BTC were to take off, the economy would fail - and concluding therefore that it won't take off.

Firstly, in step 5 you need to understand that we need to allow for savings. If all money is created by new debt and the government always runs a balanced budget, we cannot, in aggregate, possess any savings in the currency the government issues. If households/businesses are trying to deleverage on the back of a massive financial crisis, they need all those additional bits of paper provided by the government before they'd even be willing to spend as much as they used to. Hence those bits of paper needn't be inflationary, they may simply be being put aside by us, or being used to pay back debt (which destroys money) - as they have been.
As for step 4, you'd be correct if the economy is at capacity.
If the economy cannot expand to meet the demand placed on it by the deficit, prices will rise instead of output. This is an inflation tax, reducing the buying power of households and businesses.
If you have an inflation targeting central bank (we do), interest rates will rise instead of inflation - crowding out private sector investment and making spending more expensive. Any time you see interest rates increase you'd be right to blame the government - they're spending too high for their level of taxation, demand is heating up, and interest rates are being used to stifle investment to allow the government to deficit spend.
Today, the economy has a huge amount of excess capacity. Interest rates can't go any lower, we can't through monetary policy encourage any more spending than is already occurring but there's over a billion man hours of labor lost every single fortnight - there's a *massive* amount of room in the economy to support additional spending, the wastage is simply horrendous. This needn't even be on "big government" expenditure - it could just as easily be tax cuts on middle/low income earners. Both would bring about a considerably larger private sector then we have today.
Effectively, taxes are what the government uses to A) give its currency worth and B) shrink the private sector so that the private sector + public sector can fit in the space of the real constraints of production. Today, the private sector + public sector are leaving a huge portion of real resources underutilised, something lowering taxes or increasing expenditure would quickly solve.

There's a huge secondary market for government debt. If you have one and you need cash to spend instead, converting it to cash (at least for banks) takes next to no time - bonds are incredibly liquid. This is the market the Fed plays in every night to maintain rates, when it wants to lower interest rates it can simply buy bonds off this market, bidding the price up (and therefore interest rates down), when it wants to lower rates it simply sells some from its portfolio, more sellers = a lower price = higher interest rates.
Every interest rate in the economy is heavily affected by altering the price of these "completely safe" securities, at least until interest rates have bottomed out at zero, then purchasing more does extremely little if anything.
More completely though, the Fed typically purchases via [repurchase agreements]( It's still pretty much the same as the above, but the Fed never actually outright purchases these securities - it only holds on to them for a while, temporarily supplying banks with cash until the date agreed in advance that they swap back. At that, the Fed uses them in a very similar to the ECB's [refinancing operations]( - which is where the ECB simply offers money up front that expires after X date, and asks banks to offer collateral for it and bid for these refinancing operations.
As an aside, QE *is* an outright purchase, which is where some observers get nervous - what if the Fed can't find buyers for its bonds, now that no one's obliged to take them they ask. How will the Fed lift rates if it can't find buyers for its bonds? To me that's all phooey, for as long as the market assumes that bonds are as safe as the cash they are denominated in - for as long as they believe the government will [follow the constitution]( and not default, the Fed ought never have difficulty finding people willing to trade their cash for bonds. But anywhere, that's their concern - that the Fed's balance sheet is worthless.

How is that important when the number of potential forks and alternative cryptocurrencies is limitless?
The argument that it could one day replace conventional fiat as reserves I also find quite absurd. The only reason central banks keep reserves is as a store of wealth, so that they can later appreciate their currency should they need to buy more from the rest of the world when exports are underperforming. It's only useful if you can be sure that other nations will want what you're keeping in reserve at least as much as you do.
For this USD works - it's the national currency of the highest GDP nation in the world and required by millions of people to pay their taxes and pay down their debt. The same cannot be said for Bitcoin. Whyever would a central bank start buying up Bitcoin today, well before anyone needs it? I mean, reserves are kept as a safety net - the complete opposite of speculation, yet that's what a central bank would be doing switching over to it today.

This isn't true at all.
The number of hashes per second is quite irrelevant, as is whether the hash is computable on GPUs or just CPUs, what matters is the total amount of CPU/hardware time going into securing the network as that's what determines how much a 51% attack would cost to perform.
If there was a cryptoalgorithm that took an entire second to generate a single hash on a modern day processor for which GPUs/ASICs are completely unsuitable it would still make a perfectly suitable hash algorithm to run a *coin off.

Actually it has two unique properties that Bitcoin will likely never have.
1) it is the sole currency that can be used to pay your US taxes.
2) it is the sole currency that can repay USD-denominated debts, the very same debts that create the currency in the first place.
Both are significant. The first: a government can merely impose a land tax in tokens, saying that unless this land tax is met you cannot own a house. It can then print those tokens, and it'll find a whole market of people eager to work for them to gain the privilege of owning a house. Even those it does not directly employ will trade with those it *does* employ, so they too can receive that privilege - and there, the private sector is born. That is the USD.
The second: the USD is created when someone borrows money. They create an obligation on themselves, a debt, to pay it back + interest. This is a very real need they have to seek out USD that only USD can meet. If they don't, they lose their collateral and credit rating. That, too, is the USD.
Bitcoin has neither of these properties. Unless you're shopping on silk road, nobody *needs* it - and even if you are shopping on silk road you don't need to use it as anything more than a vehicle for fiat. You don't need to hold it for any period of time, neither does the seller. See the difference?
One is inherently quite a stable system, provided the government never trivialises taxes and/or supplies so much of the currency that debt repayments are easy, its currency will have strong worth. The other is on **much** weaker foundations.
