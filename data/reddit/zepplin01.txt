Your hippie utopia dream from bitcoin was unrealistic when the idea was presented and even more unrealistic now. All bitcoin is is an investment, its real world use is impractical and will likely never become widespread. Truth is that all that matters is the price, that's why that's the only thing we talk about lmao.

That has nothing to do with the point I was making.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:31:31
I never claimed bitcoin competed with visa. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:34:16
No it isn't, and it isn't a viewpoint. It's just the simple fact that all stocks and currencies go through the process of being bought and sold, and your naive mind thinks that that can/will somehow change. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:26:58
Nothing, but you're not looking at the big picture. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:00:43
It makes absolutely no sense, especially with cryptocurrencies, when their entire point is to be a *currency*, not something you hold onto your entire life, but something you are constantly buying and selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:01:40
Eh. These types of things had to happen in order for bitcoin to grow. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:49:47
Can't wait for you to show me this actually happening with any stock or cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:33:55
because that is the process every stock and cryptocurrency goes through. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:46:38
No it doesn't, especially with cryptocurrency because all that happens when you sell it is it goes into the hands of another person or company. Every single stock and cryptocurrency goes through the process of being bought and sold, and until you can prove otherwise, I'm better off talking to a wall.

I don't need to tell you, but I will message you back in a year to laugh at you when I'm right.
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:40:13
That's because it's a corporation, not an individual person, lmao. Also a very minor example and an outlier if anything.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:59:04
Of course, it's new. Still a far better investment then bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:30:52
That every cryptocurrency and stock goes through the process of people buying and selling while they raise in price. I'd love for you to find me a single cryptocurrency or stock that got to a decent value in which the majority of people never sold it. It's simply how the market works that people constantly buy and sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:51:47
It won't ever happen, I guarantee it, as it defies basic math for it to happen.

Exactly, no nut November. So you shouldn’t have any nuts during the month, thus you cut them off

I just sold enough to get back exactly what I invested originally ($2000) so even in the worst case scenario I can at least be satisfied that I didn’t lose any money from investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:59:39
This has been debunked many times.

That was a pretty terrible analysis. Why lever up the Equity portfolio? Trump’s enterprise, just like equities in the S&amp;P500 use leverage. According to those calculations, Trump would then be leveraged twice. Had he invested his $40 million in an equity fund (unleveraged) he would have grown his $40 million to about $3 billion. So he did better in his private leveraged investment than equities in their own leveraged business. Another issue that article ignores: Trump has consumed out of his wealth quite substantially. That would have diminished the equity portfolio value even more. So, $4.5b is quite impressive when comparing to equity performance.
