There's outside factors that are moving the price, too.  Asia scared, FUD from other countries possibly banning, rejection of bitcoin with companies, mcafee fucking up altcoins w his tweets, creators selling his share out his coin, etc. Global interest in the coins is changing and governing the Action is coming into question. 
It's not just looking at past performance and expecting the future to repeat it.
PS: I believe a selection of coins will eventually rebound and hope the shitcoins die out. I'm gonna **HOLD** . (That's how I spell it)

If you haven't realized gains, there's nothing to get taxed on yet. 
if you put in 10k simply into a coin and let it sit you're okay. But if you invested 10k and exchanged any coins for altcoins, that triggered a taxable event and you'd owe taxes. 
I would simply download (or write down ,screenshot or take a pic) of all my transactions and have it ready for my tax person when the time comes to do them.

You'd be breaking even on paper. But there is an actual change occurring. The profits don't appear out of thin air. They're connected to each coin bought. So you actually have to sell a coin to gain the profit/loss.
another example. you got 10 coins, initially worth $10 (each worth $1). Those 10 coins grow to be worth $20 (each now worth $2). You have to sell your coin away to realize the profits.

PS: this is what I'm told. Someone please correct me if wrong
You would still pay taxes. If they sat for over a year, then you'd pay a smaller percentage for taxes.
For example:
Put 10k in on Jan 1, 2017 and it grows to 20k by jan 2, 2018. If you cash out 10k, then youre taking out 50% of your coins along with its profits (5k original investment and 5k profit). So you'll be paying long term capital gains on the profits.

Oh I thought we were thinking about investors in it. I was wondering how many people invest in the stock market.

It takes USD. It's an app, it's easy.
