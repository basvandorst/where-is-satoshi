You should see the spat CFB got into with ethereum’s Nick Johnson on why Ethereum isn’t morally/ethically righteous enough to put in a (copy protection) back door to kill projects like Tron if they determine them to be a scam. 
Pretty funny how anyone working in this space can promote the idea that developers be able to arbitrarily censor projects that use their open source code if rightfully attributed / credited under the OSS license. Guess IOTA doesn’t really have that problem since they don’t publish the COO code anyway. Makes the “copy protection” pretty useless. That and a competent developer leveraging another project’s code would absolutely replace a home rolled hashing function anyway to be safe...
They fucked up and looked like amateurs, got caught, now they’re doubling down and using it as a moral high ground.

Given the amount of collusion between the two in the past does it really matter? They may as well be one entity already.

Cool, arbitrary changes to the consensus model... way to uphold Satoshi's vision in the slightest. This is a dangerous statement.

Dunno, but I believe the Tesla fixation here will soon turn to “they’re not that nice anyway” before the new year.
You’ll know it when ya see it

It’s a rather fast payment system when I’m standing in person at any one of the millions of storefronts that accept it.
Other than that, just intangible global market valuation. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:13:44
Right but effective currency cannot be finite supply. That promotes even more wealth centralization and monopolization, and makes for a bad currency. Better for “store of value” narrative since no one will want to transact in something that will likely be worth more tomorrow (separate of market valuation / price) based on the principles of scarcity.
Crypto exchanges are highly manipulated and the value of cryptocurrencies are highly manipulated due to 1) malfeasance and 2) centralization of wealth to whales/miners/exchanges. 
I think manipulation and finite supply are bad indicators of true value versus market value where they are more acceptable measures.

Unless Jihan and the miners jumping in plan to make it contentious as well and force a chain split. Hence his lobbying on twitter earlier for exchgs to support any BCH spinoffs from this HF....:
Realized he can’t attack Bitcoin anymore, so now he’s going to attack BCH and wreck a lot of traders in the process.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:03:02
Then Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It is just code the market has assigned value no?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:00:44
Yeah instead we’ll just fork RSK. Oh but wait, that only edits the ledger on the side chain, essentially your BTC is still locked in the pegged pool address on the main chain. Considering the issues with scalability now, how practical is it to have to wait for the block confirmations necessary? Oh and they’ll take 20% of the tx fees as well.
MAST + Simplicity &gt; RSK.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:21:24
Cute. Little brother is trying so hard.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:47:38
Cast stones... money losing shambles were due to poor Solidity contract coding and security audit. Not the platform itself.
By the way RSK uses Solidity and the EVM... so all of those risks Ethereum has.... this side chain will have.
The only way Ethereum or Bitcoin will be safe running any kind of smart contract is by increasing and formalizing the standards with which smart contracts are coded and audited. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:33:58
It’s funny you have a Tesla logo there... you may not be so happy in a few weeks...
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:27:57
Formal verification helps, but it is still not 100% secure. You have some assurance that the code / contract is secure when compared to the requirements it is validated against. But that also means you have to have the appropriate set of requirements defined, and a specification modeled.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:03:01
What... on the sidechain? Well yeah. I don’t see how mainchain transactions are affected even with merged mining.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:45:36
How is a transaction falling out of the chain due to a pushed patch to reorg / reject block 74638 part of normal operation? They advised everyone to stop generating, and to restore the blockchain data from a snapshot prior to block 74638. Normal reorg conditions require no action such as this and generate orphans and move on. This required direct intervention.
Also you said it was an invalid tx, but at the time t was valid, correct? It seems it wouldn’t have been recognized as an invalid tx until after Gavin’s patch.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:21:36
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:23:49
They were outnumbered because a client update was pushed in about 5 hours and fortunately the nodes/miners updated. That’s still a reversion is it not?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:03:08
Also “smart contracts create unnecessary network bloat.” So then how do they plan to handle the block size / weight limitation that other smart contract centric blockchains don’t have because of variable block size / gas limits.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:49:30
I see so essentially “nip it in the bud” vs an actual reversion, since there was nothing to revert once the initial nodes were updated to reject the invalid block. Good to know. Thank you for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:29:47
This is narrow sighted as hell. Your assumption is there is no market for things different than Bitcoin and its use cases. That is simply not true and the market echoes that already.
By this thinking the world really doesn't need Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, because they all do something similar and any one of them can replicate what the others do with some time and effort. Yet here they are with significant niches carved out in the social media and networking market.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:17:11
Good read!
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:12:28
Paraphrases from and twitter... kind of like “this is good for bitcoin”
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:19:49
So why aren’t there still 184+ billion Bitcoin in existence? Since we’re talking reversibility here, your position is that it should only occur when the protocol is affected and no one suffered losses (except the exploiter who arguably lost 184bn when longest chain won out)... and not when mass theft causes real loss for real people?
Let’s just rewrite history to pretend that bitcoin is still immutable while we are at it.
You don’t get to lecture others on path toward sound governance because you choose to ignore the past of the protocol you support.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:57:55
Formal verifiability how, I am a smart contract coder, OWASP, and code reviewer and I see no way to make any claim that ANY code is 100% safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:11:16
Have learned about it, but there’s no equating formal verification to safeness of complexly coded smart contracts. Which was why I was responding to this while drawing from the claim below that it supports Simplicity as “provably safe.”
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:51:41
“We don’t need smart contracts, they’re not part of Satoshi’s original vision”
“Smart contracts and ICOs have been a bane for crypto”
“Smart contracts will never succeed , they’re too complex”
“Ethereum will fail, Smart contracts are impractical and legally unenforceable”
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:24:15
Better analogy would be blaming http/https for SQL injectable pages.
Also, it’s really just a hold your breath or “just a matter of time” scenario with Simplicity as well. There will likely be a vulnerability and it’s likely to be exploited before it is fixed. The difficulty of secure coding in a nutshell... not being able to know or prevent unknown attack vectors until they’re exploited. You can only prevent against what you know. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:15:11
I agree. Currency is not a good use case for Ether, it is better served as a utility in gas, and speculative asset.
Same can be said for Bitcoin because fixed supply coins / assets make poor currencies versus stores of value. No one wants to pay with something today knowing it will be worth more tomorrow. Better use as SoV and speculative asset / investment. In the same way Gold was a bad form of currency (monopolized and centralized to the wealthy), but a better store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:04:44
Go to twitter and search the Blockstream Devs’ names and “smart contract” and note how they all recently switched their rhetoric from “unnecessary” and “too complex” to one of support. Especially Adam and Greg.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:13:09
Yet the release posits formal verifiability to suggest it is provably safe.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:01:11
Pray tell how one can claim decentralization when your confirmation nodes are becoming more and more centralized due to the computational power required? If I'm the only person with the ability to mine because of the difficulty and resources required, I have a stranglehold over the technology.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:49:17
With a massive backlog and increasingly inflated fees that won't be the case for much longer. Look at OkCoin's release and BitPay at Consensus. There's a real loss of trust in the blockchain. Needs to be restored quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:40:37
ETC yes, ETH no. I assume this is how MySpace investors treated Facebook before they went down with the ship.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:56:18
Yes but they are actively working together to address those issues, where as Bitcoin sits a house divided on the matter.
@_date: 2017-07-19 01:58:57
That and BIP91 comes with the intention to HF for the 2mb block size increase. Not sure why miners wouldn't want that.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:12:01
Is it? I thought blockmain and Unlimited said 2mb was a bandaid and not enough. Why can't SegWit be activated on a 4mb block scalable by the miner? Not advocating that but just curious.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:59:06
No SegWit2x to prevent UASF and BIP148
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:52:02
I will preface this question by saying I Hodl both BTC and ETH, but, is SegWit2x just a preemptive strike by the miners to prevent BIP148? I know everyone seems generally happy with SegWit signaling, but will the miners just HF the chain anyway down the road when they don't get the bigblocks they want or the scaling power? How do you prevent that from happening. 
I'm somewhat concerned this just kicks the can down the road a bit.
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:50:04
No fucking shit. If that's all you know about it you're truly clueless
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:59:05
Now it's a malevolent war zone between two selfish factions... need a viable compromise with self interests set aside in favor of the future of Bitcoin as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:39:05
Fundamentally different purposes than SegWit2x, especially considering the hard fork 3 months following.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:47:09
What does that have to do with LN? An exchange sees a money making opportunity, that about it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:44:36
I'm actually asking because I don't know. Is it, or is it a legit attempt to move forward with some concession?

Barry needs to go away. He's been doing a disservice to crypto for years. Propping up and tearing down based on nothing but profit for years.

Interesting. How well tested is LN by now? Have the risks been measured / mitigated?
