I will never understand the argument of time taken to open an exchange account ?
Its like adding the time to open a bank account to every bank transaction you do.
Yes you have to do it once, but then you are all set for your next transaction.

Source of this hashrate flip theory ?
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:23:27
Because no alt coin claims to be Bitcoin.
They respectfully accept that they are alt coin and proudly say that they are better than Bitcoin. I like concept behind some of them.
But bitcoin cash is trying to impose as Bitcoin, and this is not acceptable in any market.
If Bitcoin cash team come forward and claim that they are better than Bitcoin, it's perfectly fine. But the irony here is that for that they have to admit that BCH is not Bitcoin ��

Give that guy his money back. You are just a wallet you have no authority to ask for a ID or photo. 
Thanks for the heads up I may uninstll freewallet although I never used it but it may be a Spyware or something. After all a scam is a scam.

You can short on bitmex or bitfinex but alternatively you can convert your BTC to USDT or TUSD this is also equivalent to 1x shorting on bitmex.

Not talking about 'Ver' he is a good fraud but talking about those who follow him blindly.  I mean come on guys bcash could do good if they do something innovative but  it hurts to see that all they are doing is increasing block size and trying to impose as Bitcoin?

Raise the ceiling ofcourse.
What kind of stupid question is that ?
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:04:05
I read again and found nothing about speculation involved in mining, or increase in BTC reward when hashrate decrease ( one can get more Bitcoin for less resources)
Now how about you read my comment and answer my question.
And just to clarify my opinion - yes I think BTC mining cost will create a floor value but I am totally aware that in highly speculative and leveraged market price may very well break it.
You stated in your Post that the price is falling and "nothing" can stop it. I wonder why would you base your theory on such an assumption ?
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:14:20
Don't bother buddy. Thread is heavily monitored by FUDders they will simply downvote any arguments against there theory. You can see the most upvoted comment is - true, pretty obvious.
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:21:20
True. 
But as I said above the artist will never sell it dirt cheap if he's not living on the streets.
Secondly you can't actually compare art to a digital currency because every art piece is different and every Bitcoin is same and even if you do compare them then Bitcoin is one of the most famous artwork.
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:09:35
It looks like you totally misunderstood the concept of mining. It's just like speculation ( on a different time scale) 
When Miners will decide if it's worth to mine a Bitcoin or not they will take in account the current as well as future price of Bitcoin. Suppose Bitcoin price drop to 1/10 as a result some miners exit and because of this reward for mining becomes x10 so new miners will start mining. 
This will be same feeling like - ohhh it's so cheap right now why don't I start mining ( or start buying from the market) and accumulate more for the future.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:54:49
So you are correcting a misconception by creating another one ? ��
If someone put a lot of effort to build something he will definitely want proportional amount of money (whatever amount he thinks). If market is down and no one is willing to pay that price he will keep it (until and unless he's totally living on Bitcoin). Miners already paid for their equipments and electricity so they will hold it until they get the right price and the same thing goes for all the Big hodlers/whales.
People who are ignorantly shorting Bitcoin at 6000 in fear and FUD will be buying it crazily in FOMO even if it reaches 8000.

So you told a shady exchange that you are transferring your money out of their exchange ?

Judging by your reaction it looks like you buy at 20k wait until 15k - 10k - 9k -  8k and out of frustration sold at 7k.
Now every time someone says it will bounce back from 6k you lose your temper ��"curse you Hodlers you all should suffer "��

I have no experience with them but ( if) that's the case you are right to warn others. And don't listen to the people who want you to be quite because they think $100 is small amount of money. If it's your hard earned money you have every right to shout about it.
