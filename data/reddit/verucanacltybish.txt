Thank you, so so so much. This is going to save lives. When a parent suffers from PTSD it greatly affects their children. You are helping heal entire families and change their lives for the better. I love and appreciate you and your generous and humble spirit. ��

Do you have a website for your 501c3? I love this idea!

Second this. I did MDMA therapy (privately, not through MAPS) and Ayayhuasca to help with my PTSD.  It saved and changed my life.

Scrolled down looking to see if anyone had suggested MAPS and so excited to see they made a play for it themselves! Way to be proactive, as always, So, another +1 for MAPS. MDMA therapy has saved my life and I wouldn't happy/healthy/sane without their research! Also, shout out to everyone at r/MDMAtherapy who might also be in this sub.

Did not expect to have a little bit of yoga/zen/prana pop up in this morning. HODL your BTC but not your breath; let it go, let it flow.

Thank you! MDMA therapy saved/changed my life! I wouldn't be here without their studies.

From below...   
Please donate to MAPS - the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]( They are conducting groundbreaking research with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is proving to be more effective than all existing treatments.
MDMA is scheduled to become prescription medicine by 2021, and psychedelic therapy more broadly is one of the most promising areas in current scientific and medical research. MAPS is the main organization spearheading the research and conducting clinical trials to get through the FDA approval process is extremely expensive.
In the longer term, psychedelic research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ailments like depression, anxiety and addiction, and replace the pharmaceutical industry with more affordable and effective options.
Here is their cryptocurrency donation page:

You up voted MAPS on the Christmas BTC donation, right? MDMA therapy is life saving and life changing.

I've encountered the same thing. Showing them the math is half the fun of explaining it!

Those charges were dismissed and can never be refiled. He was not tried or found guilty of that.

I'm with you on all points. WS is inflating it while the government is doing what they can to make it illegal. Its going to catch a lot of folks here by the balls. Always have an exit strategy and don't put in what you can't afford to lose.

Is that what is going on?! I've been freaking out that I couldn't log in to Gemini since 10pm EST last night. Still can't log in.  So upsetting. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:26:21
My dad did the same. My parents are preppers. Its amusing but occasionally frightening the level they take it to. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:05:45
Oh, so exactly what I'm talking about. Thank you.

this comment made me fall in love with you a little bit.

Everyone in my family owns gold. My parents encouraged us to buy a little with every paycheck. My siblings and I preferred to collect coins or silver ingots. Silver is kind of a pain because it takes up so much space but you can find some really artful, interesting pieces. Coins are fun for the dates and histories. Some of them are pretty. Gold you have to buy in such small quantities that it isn't that interesting. But, it adds up. Buying little .1 oz chips and then trading them in for full oz feels good man. I'd much rather have BTC or ETH though.

This.  Yes, so much of this. Literally every single day i realize how much more I have to learn, so i research and learn how.much more l have to learn. Its fantastic and a huge driving force for me right now. I love it! And, because I'm excited about it, my family and friends are feeling the buzz. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:27:10
It is just a way to hold value in a relatively stable way. For me, its mostly a way to keep my assets diversified. My dad has always drilled it into my head to not put all the eggs in one basket. I'm now trying to get him to buy some BTC or ETH.

I was one of those 6-8 year old girls at the time.... Bowie's appeal transcends hormonal urges. He's just art encarnate. He was beautiful and magical as Jareth.

Good. You shouldn't hide things in a divorce.
