Your seed is your coins. There is a standard (google bip38 and mnemonic keys) for these seeds. Even if eletctrum dies, you can still recover your coins.

You should probably move your coins from another network/pc to a new, unused address to be safe. Seems like your pc and phone are compromised.

I’ve used  on an airgapped laptop before I got a hardware wallet. But now that I have trezor model t I don’t want to go back. I still have some funds saved with armory since it’s quite easy to use shamir secret sharing, but I don’t recommend armory for daily use.

I did exactly the same thing but with a custom design :). post-Christmas pump will be insane.

Will you ever move your coins?

I did gift a friends two newborn sons each a physical bitcoin, one in 2013 and one in 2014. I said something like this: "hodl them till they are 18 and let's see what they are worth" 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:26:43
check your address/transaction id on something like blockchain.info. If it is there, just wait and don't worry.

I'd buy one, a yellow circle around the b would be even better.

well, if he were to push forward with 2x, he would be very alone since the other supporters withdrew from 2x.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:25:50
I'm basically at a point where I consider that I lost everything I had gox. Reviving gox and "potentially" giving me back something would be the best option imho.

Yes, besides many changes that happened to the Bitcoin codebase but haven't been applied to bcash, Bitcoin also has segwit enabled, which makes the upcoming(~late 2018) lightning network much more usable.
You should read up on sewgit and lightning if you don't know what it means.

Watch this  and you learn what scaling means and what needs to happen to do it.
bcash is just a Bitcoin clone/fork with a basic blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:40:56
It’s decreasing, yesterday we were at ~170k
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:43
bcash has a “emergency difficulty adjustment”(eda) that also previously caused miners to rush mining bcash at a low difficulty. after 2016 blocks the difficulty increases by 4, after which the eda will kick in again if not enough blocks were found in a  given period and repeating the cycle. 
Check the link in my previous post and you will see the cycles in the chart.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:03:03
The problem is not the blocksize increase itself. 
First, the problem is that THIS increase was tried to be forced upon us by a company, that would have paved the way for future corporate influence. 
Second, just increasing the blocksize can't be the final solution and segwit was only the start of what is needed.
I recommend that you watch  for further details regarding scaling.

sorry, was the wrong shitcoin, roger is pumping so many shitcoins that it is hard to keep up ;)

This strongly correlates to the recent 30% drop in hashrate, right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:43:51
"If not I take maybe a $40k hit." well, not quite sure about that TROLOLOL
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:42:24
Yes, that’s the current estimate and may change.

the difficulty on bcash is currently very low and the price is somewhat temporarily, high, making mining bcash more profitable. This causes the miners to switch over to mining bcash (reducing the Bitcoin blockrate/transactions), the miners will return to Bitcoin in about 24 hours when the bcash difficulty readjusts. After this Bitcoin blocks will be found more frequently and reducing the backlog.
TLDR: Bitcoin is currently under attack by bcash and will resume normal operation in about 24 hours.

The Olsen twins aren’t real. There is just one moving back and forth so quickly, that it seems like there are two.

Yes, these 24 words, also known as seed, are used to generate private keys. In fact, one single seed will generate all future private keys. That's the reason you only have to back it up once.
The whole process is explained here (warning: very technical):

I like  much more, it also shows the bcash mempool.

Sorry, I don't have the time to answer fully. 
Google for bip38 mnemonic seed recovery and you will find something useful.

very nice, but could be longer and also a bit more like a infomercial by repeating the same thing over and over again :D

nice and simple, thanks for sharing :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:59:29
there is no way to speed this up now. you could have speeded it up by providing more transaction fee.
