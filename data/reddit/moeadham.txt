Um, Stu is from Toronto. He is a good honest guy, doubt he is having a great time with all this.

This is fun
@_date: 2016-04-01 17:25:03
Agreed. Node count is easy to game. It would be nice to know how many miners there actually are behind these pools.
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:08:32
Voila: 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:45:43
That is because Bitgo already enabled SegWit for all customers.
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:49:16
So. This is a pre-paid credit card? I don't get it.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:48:31
Depends. They have mined 6 blocks in a row a few times already, which is sufficient to complete a double spend by most standards.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:09:42


Thanks, will be in next release.

I recently spent 3 weeks in Cuba and can confirm that Internet is highly inaccessible. Most Bitcoins sites (ex.  Bitstamp) are completely blocked by the national firewall. Only access is if you have a foreign (canadian) cell phone with a data plan.

This seems rather relevant now. Emphasis mine.
*Post by Jed (MtGox founder) Jan 19 2011:*
Hello everyone, MagicalTux is busy getting everything back in order on mtgox so he asked me to post here and answer any questions people have. 
First, **only a small amount of BTC was stolen**. MtGox will refund the stolen BTC to the compromised user.
Everyone's bitcoins are safe on the site. **We still are holding all the coins safely in reserve. The vast majority of the coins are stored offline so they are impossible to compromise.**
He understands the rollback won't be popular with people who were able to pick up coins for .10 or whatever but none of those trades were legitimate so mtgox has a legal obligation to reverse the trades.
I'm sure when you think about it you don't actually want to buy stolen coins and take advantage of the situation.
Things have been very hectic with mtgox since MagicalTux took over. He has simultaneously been trying to fend off persistent ddos attacks, hire more staff, deal with the huge increase in users, improve the code to support the much larger trade volume, ensure regulatory compliance and deal with various security issues. Obviously things haven't gone as smoothly as we would like but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel with more people being hired and the backend changes done. MtGox will hopefully be able to regain your trust in the coming weeks.
The site should be up again shortly. I'm asking him to clear all the standing orders.
Please post any questions you have here and I'll do my best to answer.

a) Can take months, if not years. Depending on the gravity of the attack, you may have to completely move infrastructure. This is a huge task.

They can tell you a certain IP address is telling you something it isn't?  
@_date: 2016-03-25 23:35:26
I very well understand that, but a malicious ISP can very well censor what you know about the rest of the network, and even in a certain case cause your node to fork, no?

Try moving the map around. It loads locations 30km around you.

Hey, the "monthly" fee is if you don't use the voucher by the "use by" date, which was in 2025 when I bought one. 
It seems this is to prevent people using "vouchers" as savings accounts. Vouchers are not savings accounts, they are payment devices. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:03:23
Yep. Here:
@_date: 2016-03-24 18:37:20
It was closer to 20% when I tried? Also, only EUR. I couldn't buy an EUR voucher here... 
@_date: 2016-03-25 14:50:41
But you can trust your local ISP?
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:21:10
Yeah its huge because they are old inputs from a different time. Looks like they might be stuck there forever.
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:35:41
I am a Coinbase customer. So, can I file one of these briefs to also be excluded?
This recent rebuttal by the IRS would be comical if it wasn't so terrifying.

Confirmation times will follow a distribution with an average of 10 minutes, so shorter/longer than 10 minutes is normal. What is not good are the instances where it takes MORE than 1 block for a transaction to get confirmed. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 04:22:04
For context, this was when the specific questions was "say something positive about the opposing side". 
@_date: 2016-09-07 07:23:54
Hopefully not :P 
We worked out a bunch of the compliance and agreements to make this happen.
Enjoy Citizens of Toronto, and great work Rubix! Keep pushing the Blockchain agenda.

Oh God, I'm going to go ahead and say this will end badly. So many IRS scammers already demand payment in Bitcoin, and now they have official looking news articles to point as too.
I really hope they take severe caution on how they approach this, or Ohio could become a bastion for robo-call IRS scams.

Guys this is 100% FUD. 
I can assure you that our investors have literally no interest in the block-size debate. They are too busy for this type of nonsense.

Tl;DR: Monthly expenditures from the Foundation, Buterin said, are now due to fall from 410,000 CHF ($420,858) per month to 340,000 CHF ($349,201) on 1st October. The ultimate goal will be to reduce the Foundation's burn rate to between 200,000 CHF ($205,370) and 250,000 CHF ($256,818) per month.
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:33:00
Yeah this is really the wrong approach. One time addresses don't really do much for privacy either. 
The fungible problem with the current transaction models is a tough nut to Crack. Something like lightning might raise a whole other set of issues on what type of transactions are allowed, and how much information nodes will require/store. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:50:30
No, they store them in plaintext; as they use it as an identifier for your bill payment. Usually it is some other number, but for credit cards, alas, they don't change shit.
I am not saying this is the best way to do it, but it is actually what is happening today with online banks in Canada.
I know people who coded this. It is sadly how it works.
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:54:11
I can explain how this works in Canada.
All banks have a "Pay bills online" function. For example, to pay a credit card bill, you:
1. Log in to online banking
2. Click Pay bills
3. Type in your credit card number
4. Select how much you want to pay.
This credit card number is then stored as a "payee" in your online banking profile (in plain text), but on the Banks Servers.
That being said, I would imagine that SpendBT is still running a pretty manual process internally (spreadsheet with all the credit card numbers, one guy logs into his bank, and simply manually pays each bill).
 does almost the exact same thing.

All out BTMs are recycling cash. This is already happening on the 80+ units we have shipped worldwide. Keep an eye on us!

Interesting. You bring up a valid point, but I am not sure the foundation has unilateral control over their users. What a user defines as Ethereum is their own choice.
I would suggest that if you deposit crypto-currency into a custodial relationship (where you don't control the keys, ex. Exchanges, Coinbase), you are agreeing to the **custodians definition** of the crypto currency, whether you like it or not.
The foundation does not control the private keys of the users. Coinbase does. 
My 2 cents on the matter.
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:04:37
I really like OB, but I have yet to make a successful buy.
I recently made an order, paid, and the seller just went offline, so now I have to dispute it. 
I think there is still a long way to go. You need notifications for a system like this, but making each seller set up an SMTP server is a bit much.
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:01:20
Old news. Bitaccess launched this many months ago. Seems to be a copycat.
