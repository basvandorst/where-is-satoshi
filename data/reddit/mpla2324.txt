sure, I attend SDSU and hes doubting the availability of a capitated currency. He doesnt believe that bitcoin has a future in the modern age because of its constant ups and downs yet he doesnt compare that to the dollar or the euro. Sure it may not be as radical in a jump or a decline but the benefits of bitcoin can change the payment game all together.

an interesting website that is hoping to raise money to support bitcoin backed projects and ideas to grow its value. It also will reach out to merchants about the benefits of bitcoin to them! Support!

and there is no scam at all. our goals are the same as the bitcoin community in growing the awareness and usage of bitcoin to a worldwide modern currency. All our funds are utilized for these projects.

I thought I'd get my 2 cents in or technically my 0.00002295 BTC (at the time of this post) in to launch the idea.

the initital challenge was to even get involved with it because he thought it was a difficult process (little did he know) and secondly he thought it couldnt bring a positive impact so we set out a campaign to use bitcoin as the the medium behind our projects for social and commercial good.

he doesnt believe that an unregulated currency stands a chance in payment exchange because there is no middleman or escrow such as a bank that we have today.
