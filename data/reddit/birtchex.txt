Currently almost 400, but that's our prototype. We are still developing our production engine.

Appreciate the support, we're definitely in good company. Hopefully we can all work together and make Bitcoin a first class citizen in the finance community.

OP and co-founder here, happy to answer any questions you have.
Edit: Sorry for the slow replies, this new account I made is being comment-throttled

It's in the same vein as coinbase, as we allow direct access from your bank account to Birtchex (i.e. no middle men). 
Unfortunately, ACH transfers take 3 days... nothing much you can do about that. However unlike coinbase we do not allow you to place orders until the funds have been processed. We will also offer Dwolla as a funding source, and those funds will be processed immediately (although you still have to transfer the funds to Dwolla, which can take 3 days). I hope that makes sense.

We currently are not licensed at all (to be perfectly clear), but we are in the process of doing so. These things take time, and we don't have unlimited funds at the moment. We will definitely be licensed by the time we open our platform to the public.

Oh man, blast from the past. I remember using that years ago...
Unfortunately no, that didn't even cross my mind.

I can't answer that with an exact number, but expect something like 70-80% of MtGox's fees. We are also looking at a discount program for those who sign(ed) up early.
