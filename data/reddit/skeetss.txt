Thanks for the link! Great info.

How much did you purchase at first? If you don't mind me asking.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:02:05
I completely neglected to think of BTC like currency. It makes way more sense when I think of it correctly.

How does that work? If they're being mined constantly, are others just disappearing?
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:14:49
The more the better bud! Keep it coming, I'm all ears
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:56:13
Love that last paragraph so much. I'll consider just that.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:46:58
Well I'm glad it worked out. I'm assuming you make more calculated decisions nowadays?
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:42:27
Thanks again. One more question, is there any way you can explain what happened on 10 Apr 2013 simply? I'm trying to see what went down but I'm not quite sure exactly.
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:37:34
I gotcha. I thought there were already 21 million. I did some research and found out what you said. Thanks for the clarification.

Also very sound advice. I guess what I'm asking is how does BTC compare to stocks? Both vary but it seems as if BTC is more volatile.

Thank you, truly. I've always been into learning and you're making it easy.

I did, that's basically why I stopped lurking and made my first ever post. It would be nice to invest in something that has the potential to take off even more. Never imagined how expensive school could be when you have a few math textbooks a year to buy/rent so even though I'm thinking small scale, it would be cool to say I did it.

I hear that. Tell my grandkids about the time I bought some online currency on my PC with my plastic money card. They'll tell my kids how weird grandpa is and run off to play with their iBasketball 7S.

I hear ya buddy. I'm looking for exchange rate charts but I'm a little confused by all of the different exchange rates. Is it not a set price? Does it vary by exchanger?
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:53:57
Great advice, I never (for some reason) considered buying in increments. It could be a monthly thing, almost like spending the swear jar money on BTC.
FUCKING BITCOINS

Oh god I'm in macroeconomics and it's all starting to be useful, he said this would happen. I completely hear you there. Seems like BTC is volatile enough where it can outrun inflation.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:28:32
You were a smart person. Thanks for the info, really appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:52:16
Ahhhh I see, so people getting scared.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:36:03
Thank you everyone. You guys really showed me why reddit is awesome. Guess I should try this posting thing more often. I appreciate all the help.
