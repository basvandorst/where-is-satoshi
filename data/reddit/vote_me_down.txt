Would love to see your reaction when you turn 80 and realise you wasted your life being overly cautious in case you become a target for someone with serious resources.
Appreciate that you'll probably never be a big enough deal to be recognised by your neighbours, let alone the government.

Doesn't sound like a "final answer", it sounds as though they've asked their developer to find out what happened to your money.
Never heard back? From just before the weekend to just after the weekend? Give them a chance. If $30 is so precious to you, don't convert it into a currency still in its alpha release.
Yelling "scam" and "thief" at the drop of a hat is fairly childish.

Who knows what extenuating circumstances there are in any event Redditors are so quick to call "liar!" on. The pitchfork brigade have been proven wrong time and time again, yet it continues because so many people - convinced in their own intellectual superiority - stupidly believe in black-and-white.
And most of the time, it doesn't make the damnedest difference. Investing time going to effort trying to prove someone didn't buy Bitcoin for the price they said they did is pointless, especially when this subreddit is built on lies and fanaticism.

You seem to have severe comprehension difficulties...
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:50:18
The irony there, of course, is that the whole post relies on the oversimplification of the problem to feign security.
You won't understand, because you're as gullible as most of the saps who post this nonsense - and that in itself is a very valid problem: if you understand the subject matter while looking at the posts in it really is very embarrassing.
The problem with this post is it doesn't matter at all if the number of bits leads to an unwieldy number. You start attacking the algorithm instead.
It's akin to saying "I've got a 43 character alpha-numeric password, I'm invincible."
Alas, you're an idiot.
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:20:57
It isn't like saying that at all. It's like saying, "You're making a large payment that would usually be subject to our checks, but you've split it into a number of smaller payments assumedly to avoid those checks".
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:19:14
In this case, a valid reason is $item_id is likely from a database, is known to be valid, but has no guarantee whether it's an int or a string representation of an int.
However, $thatitem is likely user input that you've since sanitised and so is probably an int. No need to cast the db value to an int just so you can type-check.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:59:13
In fairness, you do sound like a kid.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:28:00
"sec pro" who assumes an open source project's source matches that of the precompiled binaries? You're not a very good "sec pro".
So it may help you in the future:
* disect is spelt 'dissect'
* security professionals don't really call themselves "sec pro"s
* when someone does good work for free for the benefit of a community, you come off as a douche if you roll in trying to insult him to make yourself sound important, having done nothing yourself.
Edit: Oh, , don't delete your comments, stand by your statement! Oh well. The final act of cowardice.

This is such a misrepresentation of computer security.

As someone who hasn't participated in this thread, let me quietly pull you aside and tell you that you're humiliating yourself, but you're too inexperienced (in both life and software development) to know why.

You've just stopped every product page from loading, and the company is now making 0 sales. Well done.

Okay, so this guy committed fraud and stole $10.
I bet he didn't edit the e-mail sent time - I hope Coinbase look at who they sent mail to at 9:12pm on Wed Aug 13 and follow it up.

You seem to think you're special, that's pretty funny.
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:13:20
I don't see how my response suggests I didn't pick up on the "sarcasm", but you do seem a bit thick so that may be how you interpreted it. The was for how you thought it would be amusing to continue - it wasn't, btw.
@_date: 2014-08-09 22:59:31
I'm not saying the maths adds up, I'm saying maybe he's wrong about something, or maybe he's forgotten he bought some manually when the price dipped. I don't care why his story isn't correct, and I certainly don't jump to the conclusion that he's just flat-out lying. Nor do I feel the need to make sure everyone on Reddit sees him as a villain, and I feel a little sad for the people that consider it important.
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:58:45
It probably wasn't.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:50:34




Odd - your LinkedIn profile says you began a Masters in 2007. Are you pretending to be a child on the Internet?
It's pretty sad if you're pretending to be a kid to get out of an argument, and then walk away thinking you "won".
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:06:19
Haha, no. There was a negative thing posted about Bitcoin, you didn't know enough to defend it, so you tried to go the smartass route. It didn't pan out, so you played the "you have emotional problems" card. Realising at no point could you provide a single counter-argument, you skedaddled. I'd say that sums it up.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:23:49
Sadly I'm not surprised, it's the easiest attack vector in this kind of scenario. I wish it was standard that the exact build environment was described so that the compiled binaries could be compared with the source - which otherwise can be difficult on Windows.
Even then, though, there's nothing to stop them serving up different binaries depending on certain criteria (e.g., number of hits to the site by the user).
@_date: 2014-08-09 18:38:00
Because people like think it makes them look smarter to "prove" someone else wrong. And, sadly, a lot of Redditors lap it up.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:36:10
Haven't heard of one myself, but I've certainly heard of vulns in various containers that can be run in guests leading to exploitation of the host, so it is feasible. Unlikely, but I still wouldn't want to be the first.
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:45:07
You say that as if it was erroneous, to be fixed by adding the type-matching.
I'm struggling to think of a situation where you have the item ID and the ID of an item they've requested, and they can differ by type and not value to the detriment of the system. Do suggest a hypothetical, but I'm doubtful a valid situation exists.
The *actual* correct answer is not doing this kind of check at all, and instead going along the lines of adding a database record (assuming this is database-driven) to reflect an excluded payment type.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:14:04
Ah, ignorance mixed with arrogance.

They're saying that the bet was never actually placed - I don't see how anything you've said disproves that. Sure, it says "Bet: 3" - but I don't see any money get deducted from your account, and your video curiously starts just after you've placed the bet.
And you want $600-800 for how they spoke to you? That's a joke.

An Intranet is an organisation-wide network, which can be comprised of multiple LANs.
Your meaningless call to authority probably sounded good in your head, but even if true, doesn't mean you're correct... just incompetent.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:48:59
Responding smugly doesn't wipe out the fact that you were wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:27:47
Not really. As they've already said, the bet wasn't actually placed. The bug here sounds like if you place a bet within a certain time after betting closes, the GUI makes it appear the bet is placed, but no actual transaction takes place.
Annoying, but it doesn't seem like anyone should owe anything because of it.

People can become targets when they are (mistakenly) seen as owning a currency worth millions/billions of dollars.

Could have saved 5c and done it through your bank. Several years ago, if you'd wanted.
And while you continue to measure the transaction in dollars, you're doing more harm than good to btc.

No, but I like to remind people from time to time. I figured readers here had a better chance of redemption than those supporting the cringe-inducing story from earlier where the guy described himself as a 'digital nomad' no fewer than three times in a post.

[mustyoshi](comment was nothing short of moronic, but you managed to get in there with some idiocy of your own.
Well done, team.
@_date: 2016-05-08 14:31:54
Cool, I assumed you were piping some online shell script from curl through sudo'd bash that downloaded, compiled, and installed it for you. Nice to see I was being unduly arrogant.
I don't entirely agree with the conclusion because of point 1, but yes, I accept it's unlikely that it's the avenue anyone interested *and* powerful enough is going to take.

This is how news breaks of a Bitcoin marketplace getting compromised, and the top comment by a considerable margin is irrelevant snark.
What an immature community this is.

Well done on finding an article on the Internet that agrees with you though, that must have been difficult. Unfortunate that the one you picked comes from the Grauniad.

No. It sounds like you'd be fine creating an artificial separation between "pseudoanonymous currency" and "money", so I'm sure you wouldn't hesitate, but it is just someone's money.

I'm not convinced. There'd be a number of hard drives dotted around the place (dozens? Hundreds? More?), all fairly smashed up. We're probably talking reading bit-by-bit, possibly with microscopes in a very manual process. On each drive until you find the right one. Maybe petabytes, manually read, bit-by-bit.
On top of that, there'd be numerous large sources of magnetism, which could be enough to have an effect on a smashed up drive, especially if platters are exposed.

Except what actually happened was there was a stove glowing brightly red, with a notice next to it saying, "Warning: hot stove".
You then came along, and put your own notice next to the stove, "I saw the warning sign, so I put my hand on the stove. I burned my hand. Incidentally, guys, I'm rich".
People then called you an idiot, which I agree was a little unnecessary. I then asked, "You're rich?", to which you replied "Okay, I'm not really, I lied".
Basically, you added nothing, and did it in kind of a dumb way.
