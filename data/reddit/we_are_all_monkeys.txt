Me too. I'm going all in if it hits $900 again.

Well, this is totally naive.

This sounds like the rantings of some 14 year old kid who just read Atlas Shrugged.

Just starting out with Bitcoin, so can I ask why not? As I understand it, they don't hold your private key and it seems pretty simple. Admittedly I only have like 0.2 BTC total so not hugely concerned about security.

Don't bother. You're pissing into the wind. These people are delusional and are one of the reasons why the Bitcoin "community" is such a joke.

What is it about this guy that brings out the loonies? Ross Ulbricht was, and remains, a giant piece of shit.

My understanding (which is probably wrong) is that any coins you have before the fork will remain since both forks will have the current blockchain up until the point of the fork. Any new coins you acquire may or may not become worthless, depending on which fork "wins" in the end. Any transaction you make after the fork "locks" you in to that fork since the other fork will have no record of that transaction.
