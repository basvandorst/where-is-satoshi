if youre sybiled it means your node is isolated, the only chain you know of is the chain I feed you. I dont even have to mine more than one block. I jsut feed you the main chain slowly to trigger your EDA. After a while I mine one block (where I spend the coins) and you give me somt in exchange. After that I let tou know about the main chain and the chain I've been feeding you gets reorged and youbget rekt. GG. Alot faster with EDA.

consider this, if you want to go around a centralization hub on the LN its possible. What if you're like normally I dont mind paying low fees to go through this government watched hub but this time I'd like a less visiblr route, you still can with LN. The centralization problem is not existent. Its more a fees optimization solution. pay less and peobably get watched or pay more and be anonymous.

I know that place and its situated in a village. the real estate isnt worth much to start with. I think 100 btc is WAYyyy overpriced. I would pay in fiat rather than with BTC. Think about it, if you pay with fiat you're on tje hook for a few years on a morgage. The guy is asking for BTC because there is no BTC lending sp hes asking you to pay straight cash and to deal with whatever tax problems you might have. Your BTC will appreciate a shit ton more in the coming years. I think a fair price in BTC would be like 10 BTC today, probably less.

no, pow change can fix all the problems you have. also miners should not be taken into account im conscensus.

Compromises is how you end up in a fiat system where the few decide for the many. Compromises is how you end up with tyrants. You do not compromise for freedom. Giving in to threats leads to more threats, not less.

didnt think of that. I mean if you're sybiled youre generally fucked. so I can just not  feed you any blocks and wait for EDA to kick in a few times.

Hardfork are a concern if they actually split the community a.k.a that people start SELLING their BTC for the fork, creating effectively 2 Bitcoins. BCH is being financed by ALTS and FIAT, it's not a threat, in fact, alot of that money is going to get pumped in the best financial asset existing in the world, you guessed it, Bitcoin. 
The net result is simply BTC oversupplying more fiat to the world and stealing more value from alts. Don't believe me ? Look at the price, that shit is not moving, it corrected a little. If people were taking this BCH seriously it would actually be a disaster. 
Just beware of the paid spammers. They are not kind and polite and they are enraging using retard logic. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:27:55
Consider the fact that most people do not know how fiat money is created. The fact you don't understand totally the technology should not be a hindrance to actually using a currency. In fact you shouldn't even feel bad for it. A currency that requires EVERY USER to understand and know all the intricacies of it is doomed. Mainstream means available to use to our lowest common denominator. If 5 yo kids can't use bitcoins as well as 95Yo grumpy grandpas then the technology is not yet ready for mainstream. It will  get there but now we are the lunatic fringe looking at a dream. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:58:34
while true, its kindof dumb given the position they are in.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:04:00
Think of it as opening a bank account where the bank does not own your deposit. It just lets you use the network they have to transact. But that network is the whole world. And you can be certain that the money transacted is not being created out of thin air because it is secured on the blockchain.

well as was stated on the GitHub the change they are trying to make is far from having conscensus. Furthermore, btc1 nodes are a tiny minority of the nodes out there. The Bitcoin they are building is a business controlled coin which will never have consensus. They are trying to make an attack on the legacy chain and potentially contentiously reorg it. 
since they are trying to Hardfork it contentiously with low nodes count... well the exchanges will not list them because it's akin to theft of user's money and a secrity compromise. If they wanna HF, they can go ahead and do it. They should include replay protection for their user's sake. Also replay protection is harder to do on the legacy chain apparently.

Ive given this much thought lately and I think its sensible to include a regular PoW change every like 5 to 10 years. Idk how much it will give a chance to miner decentralization. I think it will but people will end up hiring the best researchers with the advantages gained from the last PoW period. Idk, just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:21:54
In the theoritical world where indeed many bitcoins were "destroyed" by losing the key. It would eventually become profitable to mine keys to large accounts. However I don't know if that would make the whole thing collapse on itself....
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:45:33
It was intended to be like this. If they wanted organic growth they could've HFed with a lower difficulty to start with and just kept the BTC code. It was all planned. EDA also makes you VERY vulnerable to sybil attacks. 
lets say I isolate your node through a sybil attack. Then I just have to desync you from the main chain for long enough for the EDA to trigger a few times (which will take alot less time than on BTC) then I just mine blocks with very low difficulty and make you accept coins that I sign. lastly I remove the isolation and you find the network back but you're like 1000 blocks behind so I get to keep my BCH because the chain you got geta reorged. 
People do not realize how dangerous BCH EDA ia for nodes. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:20:55
you can just take a short 6 blocks after mining to get pretty much spot price. its not a gamble. Same will go for BTC.

I hope fiat makes it to a blockchain and into the LN. Faster transition to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:27:52
I dont disagree with your definition of a bubble. I think more in over - undervaluations so I guess for me, as soon as I beleive things are overvalued I feel comfortable selling. I think my way of looking at things is better for making forward looking decisions. like there is no point in waiting for the bubble to pop. What do you base your decisions on philosophically?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:49:10
In MY opinion (notice the Me part, because you did ask for my opinion). I think bitcoin is undervalued atm. I believe it will be overvalued in the future. Is that a bubble ? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:46:05
nah I believe understanding is the first block you need for valuation. I think accurate valuation can be done, notice how I didnt say that understanding is ALL you need. It is necessary but not the whole picture. I agree with that chair analogy. You do however need to put that chair in a complex rocket ship to get to mars. The ship can be made.

well those conditions are inherent to the creation of b2x. If you pay for something ahead of time and delivery never happens then you indeed take a loss. BT1 exists right now, there is indeed no technical delivery risk (only counterparty risk). 
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:31:05
well if the 2x chain never happens and you do happen to hold equal amounts of 2x coins and core coins, then its equivalent to combining them for 1btc. I fail to see the difference. let's say its skewed ans you have an excess of 2x coins, what happens then ?

pow changes are already coded in by lukejr. its a matter of flipping a switch and walling out all those asics from real value creation. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:25:46
you cannot distinguish actual growth curves (think facebook exponentianality) from bubbles. They look exactly the same. A bubble is an OverValuation of the underlying asset. To be able to call a bubble you need to be able to value correctly the underlying asset. It is impossible to do without proper understanding. What OP is pointing at is not if bitcoin is in a bubble, but that unqualified people are calling it a bubble. They might be right, but it would be a gambling call.

I always show part 1 of zeitgeist addendum so they understand how money is made and if they really want to know how banks are crooked, part 3 of the first zeitgeist is gr8. I think bitcoin doesn't make much sense if you don't understand how money is made.
