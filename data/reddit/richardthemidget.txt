Yeah, just too bad that 99.9999% of the world doesn't use bitcoin. And those who own bitcoins "hodl" it. 
But just ignore these small details.

One big supermarket adopting bitcoin would already be too much too handle. 
Also bitcoin can lose 50% of its value overnight. And has done so before. 
No, bitcoin can't "save" venezuela. It's not even a discussion.

Holy shit...seriously, holy shit. That's sad.

So after 7 years someone accepting bitcoin on his site is the top voted news on @_date: 2016-01-30 12:06:59
Do a chargeback.

You know damn well what i mean. 
Bitcoin would be completely unusable if a country were to adopt it. I'm not even gonna discuss it. 
And i have no idea what you mean with exchanges. They don't use the blockchain.

What part of my comment is incorrect? Seriously, what is wrong with my comment other than you not liking reality?
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:45:48
Why did you downvote me?
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:21:00
The blockchain wouldn't be able to handle 1 big supermarket using it exclusively. 
Maybe it's time to stop talking about countries adopting bitcoin.

You must've missed this part:


But seriously, if you can't handle people replying to you on a public messageboard without downvoting them then maybe this whole internet thing isn't for you. 
Downvoting people you disagree with it is really, really sad.
