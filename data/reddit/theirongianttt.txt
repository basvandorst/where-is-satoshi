Talked to that guy 5 years ago. He wasn't able to help. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:43
On top of that some guy tipped me, anyone know how I could get my 0.2 btc? What's that, $300?  
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:11
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:21:55
I have it. Am trying to mess with it as we speak. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:02:25
haha buddy I'm in the same boat. Someone tipped me 4 years ago and I wanna see how much it is now 
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:54:01
Okay? Who cares. The mafia knows a good opportunity when they see one, they wouldn't run out on a good business.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:01:21
Okay. Well he's in Japan, so that's irrelevant.

Fiat "scams" is not insider trading. Insider trading is not a scam. It's just people with more information than the rest of us using that information to gain.

@_date: 2014-03-06 16:10:28
If the man has been hiding for the past 5 years, why the fuck would you go dig him up to ask him stupid questions? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:43:11
You can't count cards anymore. They mix too many decks. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:23:03
Why would they stop manipulating the market if it's profitable? Would you? Of course not. Learn to ride the waves
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:09:33


So what. Insider isn't illegal with Bitcoin. It's unregulated. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:13:46
He's talking about security. You can buy security. I don't think he meant a bunch of neckbeards should gather blunt objects and gather outside the guys house. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:43:03
Insider trading is not theft. Theft is theft. Insider trading is legal with Bitcoin. I don't believe he stole anything. Never assume malice over incompetence.

Btc-e has only been out for a year you clown.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:52:02
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:01:58
Sure, but he won't go to jail for it. His business is already dead. If it's revived, it won't be by him. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:08:32


Probably why he left Japan to come to the US. He's fucked
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:48:45
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:45:25
Poker is bullshit too. I assume you're talking about holdem. You can sit there all day and never get a hand. It's all luck 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:43:14


Coming to the US is best, cause he blends in, until he picks the next place to go to.

No surprise here

And how would I go about cracking it..? I'd need a script right? 
Edit: a password i commonly use, would take 1.20 thousand centuries to crack. Thats 1200 fucking years
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:57:01


I used the word, "eventually." Not short term. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:02:29
If you post it to then it's 100% true and verified by adolf hitler
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:34:10
Because EVENTUALLY it will go back up. EVENTUALLY it will hit 2k. If you just hold your coins rather than trying to be Gordon fucking Gecko off of wall street you wouldn't lose any money
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:31:06
Where did I respond sarcastically? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:22:39


@_date: 2013-12-07 01:49:39
Not really. If I know it'll recover, it's just patience. People selling are the ones I'm profiting off of. So, I'll continue being "STUPID," and you keep panic selling and making me money. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:22:55
I have a bank account. I have money in my bank account. I have no idea how to get my money from my bank to a coin. Please, inform me. I'm in the US, shit is impossible. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:38:41
Okay, I found a "wallet.dat" Bunch of stuff like this inside

What do you mean? I only see "export" on my client
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:44:20
This sucks I could buy a car. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:31:02
Even if you are a "day trader," you could still not lose money on crashes like this. All you have to do is hold. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:38:12


I think I will. 


That won't happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:21:56
I believe it wasnt encrypted on 0.4, but 0.5 was where it got encrypted. If i'm not mistaken
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:16:17
If theres a password, doesnt it have to be encrypted?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:23:40
I'll look into this. Like I said, I'd happily compensate anyone who could help, I just don't want to get fucked
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:50:29
Okay, I have phrases in mind. Now what.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:46:12
He could be a teenager
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:25:08
If you invested more than you can afford you're in over your hea anywas. Everyone else should hold. Its in everyones best interest.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:54:06


@_date: 2013-08-23 17:36:24
Sort of. It takes hundreds of years to brute force something without any info though
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:51:41


I did
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:29:49
This is bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:44:32
Okay, just message me when you're done. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:43:52
No I was high, it could be anything. And I've tried every combination of any password I've ever used. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:48:30
I mean I think i'd be better off doing DMT 
But ill check it out
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:12:05
It's in one..
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:42:26
Yeah, I tried them. Didn't work. I'll try again I guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:57:08
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:21:26


There is? So in 2017 I can claim my 28 btc, it'll be tens of thousands at this rate. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:31:49
It does, but not with bitcoin. It works with some of the "pump and dump" alt coins, hence the name. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:03:26
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:44:23
Man... You should go sharkeesha her. Look it up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:14:44
That is actually the sketchiest site I have ever seen in my life. 


It doesn't even tell you what you're getting. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:26:42
Dictionary attack wouldnt work, niether would remembering. So im fucked
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:42:38


@_date: 2013-11-22 20:35:35
No.. is that supposed to work? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:47:11
No, I'm pointing out that large sums of money works to influence some coins, just not bitcoin. I was correcting him. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:32:30
I don't understand his instructions, can you clarify? 
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:45:19
What do I do with this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:56:42
No, you're riding the waves. That's good. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:51:53
I never updated my version. I downloaded it at 0.05, and it's still at 0.05. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:46:23


How would I know this, or find it out? I did it in November of 2010, If that helps. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:36:46
I don't think bitcoin is the right coin to just ignore for 3 years.. I suggest looking into worldcoin. It's a lot more practical, and your return would be much larger
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:19:21
I wouldn't trust my own mother with 20,000, let alone some random guy. Do I have to send my wallet to him? 
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:58:56
AWWWW yeah, highschool all over again. Will try this tomorrow. Good idea. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:30:52
Everyone should of invested an amount they're willing to lose. When you invest, you should expect the worst, that your money will be gone. So, if we all play with money we expect to lose, theres no reason to sell when the price will likely go back up. The only reason you would pull money out is if you're in over your head.
