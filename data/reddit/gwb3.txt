Very interesting answer - thanks a bunch, GD! I thought about this as well, but then was thinking this might be impossible, since someone will just make another type of digital currency to circumvent the regulations. Also with regard to Bitcoin, it seems it is now starting to get traction w/ Merchants (e.g. in the US, Overstock.com, Sacramento Kings). I envision more regulation of the processors, and in the end, even though Bitcoin is a "de-centralized currency" each country will have their own "centralized oversight authority" to regulate the processors - an authority to oversee the exchange of Bitcoin into the country's currency.

There needs to be a focus on retail because any sustainable currency needs to be easily convertible into its equivalent value in the form of a material retail good. 
Without this innate ability a digital currency such as Bitcoin will be highly volatile and speculative compared to other non-digital currencies that have existed up until this point.
This especially would be a potential risk in the context of International transfer since it is a valid concern for both the sending and receiving parties that the digital currency's value could be worth significantly more or less by the time it is exchanged into a paper currency that is easily converted into a material retail good. For example, a Western Union fee could potentially be much more preferable given the choice if a receiving party was only today exchanging their Bitcoin into Dollars that they had recieved a week ago.
If a digital currency wins over retail, it wins over everything.

Bitcoin is way too speculative right now to think of as an investment. 
Don't put any money in that you're going to lose sleep over if you find that it's significantly worth less tomorrow.

Big companies (e.g. Overstock) accepting payment in Bitcoin are the key to its viability in terms of adoption and general use by consumers. The slower this adoption process, the more speculation and volatility we will see in the interim, an inherent flaw that slows this process and threatens its sustainability.
