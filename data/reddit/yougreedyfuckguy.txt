Third time??? Probably millionth time.
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:01:34
Where do you think Bitstamp's million $ per week profit comes from? Magic?
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:32:28
Could you be more delusional?
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:05:48
This is a stupidity test to check if you believe this bullshit.
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:32:58
This is irellevant. You don't need to know the exact figures.
Just knowing that top 5 people own 30% of the supply - this is enough.
"Determine which wallets are used by businesses, and which ones are owned by people"
The ones with no transactions are definitely not USED by businesses.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:17:50
That is 0.01% of people who currently hold bitcoin. Compare that to the total population and you have a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:51:46
So, if I understood correctly, you have boys, girls and middle sex in the county?
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:54:58
Yes. It was his own conscious decision.
Why do we always have to find someone else to blame? There's noone to blame but him and his lousy parents.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:17:18
You're a bad programmer:

La kokaina.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:35:06
I mean, we've already seen a lot of money being "stolen".
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:02:06
Bitcoin is actually a lot worse!
Please, don't lie to yourself.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:31:01
That's right.
The probability of success is continuous function, not discrete like other guys think (49.9999 you can't, 50.001 you can.)
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:14:53
There's a fire in Malaysia!
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:48:29
I can sell you goxcoins for that price. Just like when they were $1000. Equal case.
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:37:15
Booster. He's lying to boost the value of his bitcoins to sell them higher.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:04:20
I could not agree more.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:38:44
you're iWeird.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:34:17
Stolen... Sure. :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:41:03
There are people exhanging goxBTC for real BTC for some factor, let's say 1:0.7. You can find them on a bitcointalk forum.
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:22:51
It's a lie. His username proves it.
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:18:07
Yep, they are totally incompetent. Instant order should buy / sell everything at the current price at the time your request reaches the top of the queue.
@_date: 2014-01-01 09:16:31
They should fix their instant order. Because it sometimes takes fucking tens of minutes to fulfill.
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:37:37
Also this.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:04:06
It's funny how bitcoiners justify everything in their favor.
If volumes were high instead, then they'd say it proves that market is not dead and there are still a lot of people who want bitcoin.
So win-win either way.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:59:43
 deposit x  btc in SR2
 withdraw y btc from SR2
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:41:43
Yes, this is true. But think in terms that the average goxBTC holder believes that will happen with the probability of 27% (therefore the price of $270). If you believe the probability is higher, then go ahead with your plan.
p.s.: I'm a little oversimplifying.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:50:48
Actually yes. Their patterns very much resembles the one of bitcoin few months ago.
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:22:42
Just look at his username.
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:47:17
He looks like a little twink. Glad he's gone.
Moreover, his parents are stupid.
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:09:43
What if I told you - it gets worse with time?
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:34:29
In Norway you get 21 years max for killing 10K people. So... if I kill just one?
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:13:09
They have obviously drugged &amp; tortured him.

Misleading title.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:28:57
I assume update means Linux?
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:38:39
1) Don't get your hopes too high, hoping that any of those 10K+ wallets are lost. Even when BTC was few cents, that was a few grand. Not something you'd simply forget.
This is actually an argument against fair distributions, as people with 50 BTC or so in 2011 probably did lose them and those with 10K+ did not.
2) Let's assume a worldwide adoption. Then imagine satoshi's 10%.
3) Again, an argument against fair distribution. Those 50BTC wallets are probably owned by just a few.
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:03:13
Thanks guys for making the scammers more perfect next time.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:57:28
Things have gotten better a lot!
There are no more delusional "$5000 a coin next month", neither there are foolish "to the moon!" exclamations. And ToTheMoonGuy is no longer here, hyping the people even more.
When the hype is over and people lose their delusi-o-glasses, my work is done. Until ... :)

"he estimated that over 21,000,000 people worldwide could justify the purchase of just one Bitcoin"...
Only if you find Satoshi, kill him, rob him of all his Bitcoin wealth and distribute it Robin Hood way.

Bitcoin investing = investing into bitcoin startups.
Just buying bitcoin is not investing.

You can double spend with 1%, if odds are in your favor.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:50:33
Not, if someone jumps in.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:35:13
Goddamn I hated you.

And then you woke up. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:55:00
Let me lick your asshole.
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:31:16
No, by buying bitcoin directly you fund those rich fucks, like the Wikileaks brothers and many others.
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:41:12
get "any" what?
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:35:09
This is actually not good. The spending should be more gradual, not the storm for a day and then quiet for months.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:13:24
I also didn't payed.
@_date: 2014-06-28 14:55:23
Concurrence should be competition.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:35:22
Do not fucking promise the yield to people, you greedy bastard. To buy a new house you essentially promise about 1000x rise.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:09:55
It's funny how you used just the opposite word you meant to use.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:31:56
It doesn't, unless it breaks $1000 there. Then it's official.
Who'd understand you, bitcoin maniacs?
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:55:46
It's a sin not to steal the fool his money.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:45:37
Dat source code.
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:58:53
With their fees, they should be able to cover that months ago!
There's something more shady going on.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:25:04
Jews are watching Bitcoin. It's a clear sign.
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:50:58

@_date: 2014-01-05 15:22:05
Haha fucking losers.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:44:13
You mean you haven't gambled yet. I can see you are a greedy fuck, all the worst to you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:03:18
In your dreams, you greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:39:44
Just like this April, yeah?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:24:52
Make that 6. Or 7. or 8.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:58:51
You are very rude. A man here asks for help to recover his wealth and you just shove this lesson up to his ass.
He probably feels great now, thanks, yeah.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:48:13
Yeah, those who were promised a huge returns. Think.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:20:55
What fee does Tenpay charge for EU transfer?
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:09:51
Please, you don't have to. It's damaging the bitcoin reputation.
In fact, me and him are rivals, battling for completely different set of values.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:10:34
That's great. I'm really glad for your son. But he should not focus solely on the price, because he might be disappointed.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:20:41
Wow. You are a smart man.
You got to join my cause.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:49:38
Happy to see someone who agrees.
People promising newcomers huge yields, that was never good. In fact, this is one argument against "Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme". There isn't anyone guaranteeing you a profit. Now, there is.
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:14:17
They have computers in croatia?
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:55:17
Yeah, yeah, just fuck off.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:35:41
\me approves.
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:41:21
Even I agree. This is the point. We want a free world and a free currency.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:14:09
The truth is nobody knows. Bitcoin could do both.
I don't like how he's presenting bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:54:24
No, thanks, we don't need any more crappy programmers and code monkeys.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:27:33
It made me pee a little.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:03:09
Fuckers are making million dollars per week in fees, yet they are so incompetent.
Is this the real world...?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:12:51
The ultimate answer: Too many greedy fucks in for the wrong reason.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:16:52

@_date: 2013-11-19 12:38:12

@_date: 2013-12-01 14:38:18
That "Sam" is just as greedy as you. Hope you feel well.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:35:19
You forgot to say he'd be dissapointed about all those greedy fucks.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:36:20
Good, but I was expecting:
Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide. No escape from reality.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:08:30
Support my cause. My cause is being into bitcoin not because of the price rise, but because of the personal and financial freedom.
But, if you ever come near Ljubljana, Slovenia, I pay you a drink :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:36:48
It's as simple as "don't be greedy".

@_date: 2013-11-29 08:53:28
You don't call that investing. You call that gambling.
If you put money in bitcoin startups, that's investing.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:34:05
This is not a case of stacked hashing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:07:39

@_date: 2013-12-24 18:37:57
You are not for real, are you?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:57:59
No, I think you can design a cryptographic scheme where disclosing just one private key doesn't endanger all of them.
This is a huge security vulnerability in my opinion.
edit: In fact, you can:
hash(intial seed + 1) -&gt; first private key;
hash(intial seed + 2) -&gt; second private key;
I've thought that's working this way. Blindly trusting the developers.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:11:20
What if bitcoin value drops 10 times? You then owe the merchant instead? Or what?
You are very stupid, young man. And greedy for assuming bitcoin's only going to rise in value.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:03:10
In your dreams, you greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:49:13

"A currency more scarce than gold."
What the literal fuck? You can say gold is more scarce than copper, because you measure both in kg. Or in pounds, for Murrica.
"A currency where noone, not even its creator, has any more power than any other person."
Sure, if you completely diregard having 1% of total supply, and 60% held by early adopters.
There I have stopped watching and hit dislike.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:08:39
That story is made-up. What idiot you have to be to believe it?
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:53:29
Why Bitcoin? How can you imagine a sustainable currency when a single person owns 400K bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:21:30
He could sign the message.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:37:43
You surely are an optimist.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:50:22
This is a very good question. Have an upvote.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:24:35
I've too contacted them, they said no.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:28:55
You deserve more upvotes.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:47:55
You greedy fuck. Do not suggest future yield to people.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:42:43
No, he just wants to kick your greedy asses. You not liking him is the reason for his negative karma.
Heck, I'm surprised mine stands quite OK.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:05:01
If you believe that, you are really stupid.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:42:07
Is the ending end a new start?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:26:39
Go cry to the Moon Fuck, you greedy piece of shit.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:39:10
Not long ago, it was even worse. People literally promising huge yields. This is one step forward to a ponzi scheme, someone promising you an enormous yield.
It has gotten better, though. Join me in my cause.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:44:23
I care. It's a nice story.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:21:15
Aw, Charlie, that really hurt!

@_date: 2013-11-20 14:33:17
Max Keiser is a prick.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:02:37
So fucking greedy!
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:57:51
You're getting into bitcoin for the wrong reasons. I'm going to kick your ass, you greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:51:29
I'm sorry, but my 5 yo brother would make a better design.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:00:26
This is really bad, thanks for notifying the public. Electrum people are clearly not that smart.
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:37:53
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:05:39
Chose me instead. He caused this mess.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:20:54
Wow. You are not greedy as the others, this is a surprise. Wanna be my friend?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:07:18
Just fuck off.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:54:42
And you're greedy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:58:37
If you want to make "a couple of extra bucks" then sell your ass to some rich old gay businessman.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:23:11
This should be a sticky.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:42:12
You don't need valium. I can lick you, if you want.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:48:17
Yes, coz greedy fucks always bitchin'
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:43:41
Let me cure you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:07:56
Moreover, as adoption grows, Bitcoin is going to more or less stabilize. This enormous growth is only seen now and probably for a few months in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:11:53
You, sir, are a greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:56:56
Don't day trade at all. Don't be greedy, it'll slap you in the face regardless.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:59:27
You wish, greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:16:11
Hello, this is cat. I've traveled *forward* in time 101 years from now. Good on OP for giving back a sandwich and a pizza.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:39:42
500K trades per second? Why do they have such lag, then?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:14:17
Oh you greedy and ignorant fuck. Do not promise the price rise to people.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:43:18
Haha. You got that greedy prick.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:03:11
Yes, this proves a lot. Not!
He just wanted to create one of those "hidden pirate treasury" stories. And fish for donation. His story is not believable.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:16:53
Is his wallet open-source?
If not, then we need an alternative. Badly. Or - we could make the fund to pay him to release it as such.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:39:28
By "everything" it is clear that I meant "everything you have in bitcoin".
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:11:40
Kick your greedy ass.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:16:44
You cannot be serious.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:23:13
Are you are able to think abstractly?
Obviously bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, because it hasn't got an operator.
I have said it's getting similar to that if people recruit newcomers, promising them huge yields.
Stupid idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:19:31
There's ALWAYS at least one person who bought at ATH. Are you retarded or what?
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:36:08
bit is already reserved unit (for entropy). You cannot do that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:30:32
Here you go, the official "You greedy fuck" seal of approval. Hope this makes you a little happier.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:45:53
Well, he was greedy. Betting on something that was already decided.
This is not a horror story.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:49:49
Well, either way, you know who I am and what I'm going to say to that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:52:13
Summon to the Moon Fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:04:55
That's not an excuse.
Slovene translation: To, da je itak že vse v pizdi, ni izgovor, da še mal bl pojebeš svoje ljudi.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:35:49
Not like. It's worse. One person, that is 0.000001% owns 5%.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:28:04
You are a greedy fuck, that's for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:30:09
Wishful thinking.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:12:27
Where's to the Moon Fuck when you need him?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:58:59
I think in 10 years a $10K per BTC could be reached.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:04:23
We've already settled that this is a scam. Read this:
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:05:26
Oh, you really are a greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:11:08
Damn, we are so smart. :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:52:18
Nope. You should never promise a return. Not even suggest it.
This way, we get too many people in for a wrong reason.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:13:29
He could prove the ownership of the private key this way.
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:01:12
200 BTC? You're greedy rich fuck, you don't need that money.

Well, they are not based in Slovenia anymore, they only use a Slovene bank.
This year, their company reported only 10.000€ profit to evade profit tax. They make 5 million € per week in profit!

I completely agree with you. I don't recommend bitcoin to common people, just maybe to some nerd without life, who accepts it as an ideology.

I guess you are pointing out the differences.

@_date: 2013-11-20 12:16:55
Please answer my first question.

Yep, it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:00:14
Don't suggest a future yield to people.
