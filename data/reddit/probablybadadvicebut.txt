hear me out.
This is what I would say to a friend.  You fucked up; you put way too much, etc etc.
If 50k is life-changing money for your family; you basically have to pull out now, take the backlash, and make ammends.
If 50k is just really, really annoying to lose, and makes you look like a fuck; I think you are better just holding on.  
Long term.. *LONG TERM* bitcoin fundamentals are mega solid.  Downward pressure makes a lot of sense; coins were WAY overbought in the previous bubble; and downward pressure has a spiral effect on mining operators selling more of their coins to cover cost; match that with strong merchant adoption.. and there are a lot of things pushing the price down.
Remember: tons of people bought willy-nilly when bitcoin was bubbling.  They bought because the price was rising.  A lot of people are selling because the price is falling.  
But for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, except in markets, but in this case the market will find a bottom well above zero.  
Prices will stabalize, here.. maybe $100 lower.. , marybe $200 lower; but infrastructure is stronger, remittances are coming, circle/coinbase are international; bitcoin ETF seems like in inevitability; and the utility of bitcoin is real.
If you got into bitcoin because you are a "trader" and it's a "fun asset".. you apparently suck at it.  Even if that is the reason, consider the long term potential of bitcoin.
I'd hate for you to lose your entire family inheritance; but you've lost most of it anyway it seems.  What I'd hate even more though, is for you to not only have lost most of the inheritance, but to have sold at the bottom, when if you had just stuck to *LONG TERM* fundamentals, that 623/avg might have been a bargain.
On margin though; how much lower can they go until your position is liquidated?
