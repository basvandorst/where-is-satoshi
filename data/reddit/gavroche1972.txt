Ditto.  I've been to a fair amount of countries, and Morocco was at the bottom of my list of countries.

Anyone else find this to be a strangely written article?  The headline tells you there is no such thing... and then the article includes some examples of correct (but different) usage of the term.

As in that it's not being shown as in relation to USD?  Yes... i noticed that too.  I'm sure they will update that soon..

My guess would be that they have had complaints from other customers in the past... so they want explicit confirmation before they allow.  But then.. just because you indeed wish to deposit money to your Coinbase account doesn't meant that you want that transaction to get stuck in limbo forever.  If you make a valid authorized transaction using your visa logo card... and never received your merchandise, you still have a valid right to make a claim (and are usually protected.. one of the advantages offered by that Visa logo).

Ha.... with what they are charging these days, probably a full coin to be seen.

Whats also funny is that the author of this particular story, while taking a jab at the reporter for not understanding what he was reporting on, goes on to say “As long as there are no laws in place for such thefts...”
Theft is theft.  The fact that cryptocurrencies aren’t regulated doesn’t mean that its not a crime to steal...

I've always wondered... people remind to factor in electricity costs when doing the profitability calculations... but do people that run them at home subtract the reduced heating bill from other normal methods of heating your home?  :-)

Cool..  But I thought BTC vanity plates had to be on a lambo...
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:31:54
So I'm curious... would it be a good idea for a trusted company to come along and act as an intermediary... a middle man... so anyone wants to buy anything (from any vender, regardless of whether they accept BTC or fiat or whatever)....  that company verifies balance in a wallet... then issues payment to vender and submits transaction of BTC to them (with a healthy profit percentage)...  vender gets instant payment from trusted company.... and this company assumes the longer transaction time that comes with a lower tx fee....
edit:  this is essentially what PayPal does for eBay.  individual sellers don't want to deal with getting payment from random people... PayPal is the go between.  I remember back in the day there was PayPal and another payment option... i forget the name... before they went solely with PayPal... or sellers had to arrange for payment directly with buyers.  PayPal made it all fast and secure.

Seems like the growth is from a lot of people that are jumping on the bandwagon fur purely financial speculation reasons, not for a true passion about the technology and goals being sought.  As soon as the dusy settles from that.... if the true believers have left, what are you left with?

I'm surprised they don't understand how much this could affect future business.  Not just from a user trust viewpoint... but from the Banks.  If you are a bank and a number of your customers are reporting issues with a company, they will stop allowing deposits to be sent there by anyone.  If major banks stop allowing deposits, kills their business.  I already read recently that someone was told by Bank of America that they wouldn't allow a transfer to Coinbase.  
edit:  I'm with Bank of America and I've made transfers to Coinbase with no issues, so I took that report as anecdotal evidence.

God is speaking to you.  You know what to do.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:32:06
Ha.... for a lot of people here their BTC has serious sentimental value...
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:26:53
When you say the true believers haven't left, are you referring to Coinbase, or "the cause.". I didn't mean true believers leaving Bitcoin or cryptos.  I just (as an admittedly newbie who has been doing a lot of reading) have been reading all the drama about the direction of Bitcoin.  It's a little discouraging to see such disagreement.  But Coinbase is like the path of least resistance for the masses to buy Bitcoin.  But if you look at progress support, fees, few currencies offered... it's not the best option.  And I don't see why true enthusiasts would use them as their sole platform.

Hey now, play nice. :-)
Sounds like a young person, who is interested.  Wouldn't it be better to attract youth that could very well be the future of crypto currency, as opposed to people just looking to get rich...
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:04:03
Ah, I agree with you completely.  I should have put a smilely face in my post... was just observing that for a lot of people here BTC is far more than just an investment...
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:19:00
Agreed... no reason to not report it.  Something does not have to be regulated to be actionable by police.  
And remember those government agents that stole bitcoin from DPR/Silk Road?  They busted their asses.
And if you can prove who stole them... a court can still order them to reimburse you, regardless of whether you get back the original bitcoin or not.

so... they are investigating themselves for insider trading... lol.  I get that many cryptos love the unregulated world of crypto currencies... but this is a byproduct.

People here are very pompous and think the only world is Reddit.  And they have their fancy abbreviations, acronyms and misspellings to back it up....
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:09:31
I agree.  And what what I find intriguing is recent participation by institutional investors.  They ordinarily participate in regulated markets.  And they have pretty stringent fiduciary obligations.  How do they react to being sandwiched between their client base (to whom they have responsibilities) and the crypto exchanges and players... who aren't necessarily playing by the same rules.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:55:52
Thats not how it works.  I have a credit card processing account for my business, and several times someone has disputed a charge.  Terms of havimg this account state that if a charge is disputed, they can immediately put a hold on money in my account, and i then have submit proof of a valid transaction.  And even though i won each time, i had to pay a chargeback fee.  So if there is a fraud charge on your card, your bank would not need to hire any legal team to go sue.  The bank will just take back the money from the vender if they cant prove its valid.

Hey, newbie here.... i've made a few small purchases with Coinbase.  But i've also et up a GDAX account.  If i make a purchase via GDAX.. is it easy to move the coin i've purchased over to my Coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:33:00
Well... when i log into GDAX, it shows my accounts having $0 balance, so i can't see the bitcoin i am holding over in Coinbase.  So i am not sure what i'm missing there...
Also, the couple purchase i made in Coinbase were from a linked bank account (not a credit card), but i was charged 4% fee... so not sure how people are getting the 1.49% that people below have referenced.
