Yes it can. GDAX is run by Coinbase so it uses the same login and therefore has the same KYC requirements so it's not really an alternative.

That's not what the IRS document says.  The document says mining new coins is income when the coins are mined.  Here is the actual text:
Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities?
Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income.

Holy Crap!  I had no idea those old dual land cards were so valuable!  I have two boxes of MtG cards from the early to mid 90s including a ton of land cards.  Not sure how many dual land cards I have but I'm sure it's more than a few.  I've been hauling those boxes around for years! Will have to open them up and see what I have.

Thanks for the offer.  I took a look at your site and it looks really nice.  I haven't decided yet the best way to sell my cards.  I think I can get more money for my top value cards selling them on ebay, even with the fees, but I haven't worked it all out yet.

I think you are basically asking: How would the bitcoin system be recovered if every copy of the blockchain on every active node got corrupted and unusable at around the same time?
However unlikely an event these days, the answer is: Yes, the bitcoin economy would call a mulligan and say 'eh, lets just forget the last 2/20/200 hours of economic activity' and restore the blockchain files from backups at a time before the corruption and go from there.  The big losers in this event are merchants that sent product out to buyers after the most recent good backup.  Buyers would have their bitcoin restored and also have the products in hand.  The merchants would have neither product or bitcoin.  Something sort of like (but not exactly like) this actually happened back in March, 2013 and was quickly resolved.

Yes. I have 3 to 5 of each type of dual land. Most in Lightly Played to NM/M condition. The most valuable single card I have is a Tabernacle At Pendrell Vale that is in pretty good shape, maybe Lightly Played. I have another card valued in th $400-$500 range but don't recall it's name. Plus I have a bunch of cards in the $15-$20 range. I'm going to get my most valuable cards professionally graded.

That makes sense to me but that's not what the IRS document says. It says:
"when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. "
The key phrase is 'as of the date of receipt', not 'as of the date of use/sale/transfer to another for good or service.

I assume you can't simply mail her cash or a prepaid debit card otherwise you would do that (wouldn't get there in time?).  In that case you will need to find a bitcoiner somewhere near Valdosta that will be willing to purchase a prepaid debit card for her.  She can then buy it from the bitcoiner with bitcoin you sent to her earlier.  
Alternatively, the bitcoiner could meet her at a gas station, fill up her tank for her and accept bitcoins from her as payment.

The first part of your reply is correct but it doesn't take that long (minutes) to create an address for a specific 5 letter word. I've played with vanitygen a bit to generate addresses that begin with 'Ghost' and it didn't take that long.

It makes more sense to me for the IRS rule to be that you don't cause an income event when you mine but you do realize capital gains or loss when you trade your mined bitcoin for goods or services, with the gain or loss being the difference in value from the time the bitcoin was mined and the time the bitcoin was spent.  I'm not saying I would like this rule or want it to come into existence, just that it seems more consistent than the rule they just put out.

You need to spend thousands of dollars on SHA256 ASIC devices to even begin to hope to earn money mining bitcoin these days.  As it is, you will only get very tiny fractions of bitcoin mining with your computer. Not even enough to cover the costs of your electricity.  Bitcoin mining has become industrial scale.  If you want to mine coins for fun look into mining an altcoin.  You may still not make money, but you will at least get some whole coins.

If I had a junk car in my yard I wanted to get rid of I could pay somebody $50 to haul it away.  From the other guys point of view he just bought a car for -$50.  In other words, at the end of the transaction he has a car AND $50.  Similarly, if I bought 1 bitcoin for -$50 I would end up with 1 bitcoin and $50 more dollars in my pocket.  Where did the $50 come from. It came from the person selling the bitcoin.  In other words, somebody said "I'll pay you $50 to take this bitcoin off my hands!"  Who would do that? Only someone really desperate to get put their bitcoin in someone else's hands.

The first task in figuring out an alternative is deciding what effect(s) we want the pic to achieve. The pic can: draw attention to article, convey information about topic of article, explain something about the subject of article, induce specific emotions in reader of article, etc. The physical bitcoin pic achieves many of the above. It draws attention because it's shiny and golden, it indicates article is most likely about money of some kind, for those that recognize the bitcoin symbol it indicates article is about bitcoin. A successful alternative should do at least as well.

Your idea is a good one and I like the domain name, but you are asking people to send bitcoins to wallets you control (if I understand your post correctly). You will have more success getting donors if you present a more professional looking website. You also need to establish a good reputation online so people will trust that you will actually send the bitcoins onto the charities. These things will take time and I wish you the best of luck.

The method requires that your computer decrypt specific files that attacker supplies. This can be done if you setup your email to auto-decrypt incoming emails from known senders. Disabling this will make the attack harder. The paper discusses other countermeasures as well.

I would consider bitcoin going underground as a failure. It would continue to exist but would have little effect on the larger world. Sadly, I suspect bitcoin will only become mainstream when governments figure out how to regulate it, tax it, and track it. They will either do that, or ban it. They can no longer ignore it. However, if they do accept it and incorporate it into existing money systems, bitcoin will eventually undermine those existing systems. That will be interesting to watch.
