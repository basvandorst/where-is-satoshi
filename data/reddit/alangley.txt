This is one of the dumbest posts I have seen on this sub.

Uh. Now the blog entry has been edited. "Insolvency" is no longer mentioned.

~~I'm confused. Does anyone else not have the button to display the address on the device? I only have the mail and print button.~~
EDIT: Solved it. I had version 1.1.15 of the app (the one installed in the device, not the Chrome app), and it turns out the latest was 1.1.18. After updating to the latest one the button popped up. I really wish they'd notify you of this stuff.

A VPN or an SSH tunnel would probably be the safest way to do that. If you don't, make sure you're using an SSL connection to whatever trading site your're using. Also, do not ever accept an untrusted certificate while you're not on a trusted network, or you could be stepping right into a MITM attack.

If that means no more image macros, youtube videos and moon crap, definitely.

I don't think it's something to worry about. If the third one was the smallest withdrawal (or biggest, I don't know how their system works), then it might have gotten processed faster than the first two because it passed a certain threshold giving it higher priority than the first two. If they're of the same size, you can always try customer support, no?

That's BTC-e's chat when someone dumps 100 BTC on Gox.

That's unfortunate.

Symbol? Not sure what you mean by that, but if you're asking how they write it, it's ビットコイン (*bittokoin*).

If bitcoin (or at least cryptocoins) do at one point become a widespread, widely adopted payment method, I definitely think we'll see Satoshi there at one point. Now's not the time, though.

And we're back again, and although the volume reached like 2k immediately after coming up, no panic ensued. I guess DDoS doesn't really accomplish much anymore. Hopefully whoever was behind the attack, if a malicious DDoS really was the cause, just lost a lot of money thinking they'd cause panic.

Why would the amount of bitcoins even matter. That's like thinking you're getting an amazing deal for exchanging a couple of thousands of dollars for a million Chilean pesos.

Heh, that's pretty cool. Might buy a couple of those Amazon codes in the near future.

Those referral links I see thrown around constantly for your site are annoying and made me actively avoid the site. Just thought I'd inform you.

Not sure what the price of BTC is on Localbitcoins for Switzerland, but I know it's awfully expensive in my country. Personally, I simply wired Bitstamp, one of the biggest exchanges, a SEPA transaction after having my account verified. The transaction was processed the next day, allowing me to buy bitcoins at a fair rate.

If anything, we're in love with hashing functions. If you're looking to test it and give ASICs something to do, be my guest:

$2600 not too long after the SR bust. Was present during the recent correction, so I sold in time and bought low again, followed by another deposit of $2600.

**Attracts me**: Most of the stuff that has been mentioned already, but also the fact that there's money to be made in it.
**Puts me off**: Although the fact that it's hard to make changes to the protocol is in many ways a good thing, it can also make it difficult to implement improvements.

I've traded a fair bit on BTC-e and Bitstamp. My experience has taught me that BTC-e simply follows Gox's every move. The volume is somewhat low, which tends to spread orders a lot during volatile hours as the orderbook takes time to fill up compared to higher volume ones. This makes it, in my opinion, harder to make a profit from day trading unless you're *really* on top of what's going on in the market and be ahead of other people. Generally, BTC-e traders seem to be pretty alert at all times. Bitstamp will react way slower to any shenanigans on Gox, but also doesn't necessarily follow it and can decide to do a lot of crazy stuff by itself. I find it a lot easier to profit on Bitstamp.

Make sure you're accessing it using HTTPS, not HTTP. It's been going down every now and then, but HTTPS works for me right now.

Something's definitely going on. It's been frozen on 367.1 for over 30 minutes with a total of about 1.5 BTC in volume.

From the looks of it, the maintenance's purpose was to switch from Cloudflare to Incapsula. I guess things didn't go as smoothly as they hoped it would. Their API seems to be having issues again as well.
