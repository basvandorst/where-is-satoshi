You would just have to send that crypto from your coinbase wallet to a different wallet.
For example, you could create a simple paper wallet, purchase a cold storage wallet like a trezor of ledger nano s, there are a lot of different ways to go about this.

FDIC insurance only covers US Fiat, not cryptoassets.
Coinbase offers the same FDIC coverage for cash reserves.

What?  An arbitrage is essentially a method to make money off of trades, and since no markets are perfectly efficient, they cannot be fully eliminated.


I would argue that an arbitrage is an actual trading strategy, insider trading is not a strategy.  I don't understand how you can try and compare the two.  If we are using that logic, then HFT is unethical as well because normal humans can't compete.

I don't give a shit either way as I don't use BitFinex - I am just saying there is an easy way to clear this whole thing up if TS kept voice logs.

Do people still feel this way even about coinbase wallets?

It shouldn't take Coinbase, valued over a billion dollars, 24 hours to process any transaction.

describing yourself as either liberal or conservative is misinformed in my opinion - each topic should be taken one at a time and opinions should be formed regardless of large party thinking

No, but what they can do is stifle innovation within the States - meaning attempting to put in place laws and regulations which hinder the attractiveness for companies in the space to operate in the US.

Make it illegal for government officials to trade off of insider tips and then put in place a government backed hit squad to execute anyone caught trading with tips.
