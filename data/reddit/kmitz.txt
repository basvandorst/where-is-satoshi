Honestly there IS demand for WP wallet. Every few weeks we see reddit posts asking for this and to me it seems inexplicable that there is just NO functional windows phone wallet available at present. If I had the skills I would make one.
And don't turn down this source of new adopters. I can say I experimented personally this lack of WP support when my GF finally asked me yesterday (after months of enduring my wild passion for Bitcoin =) to buy some btc and have a way to spend them. 
After an hour spent searching on windows store, trying to access coinbase and blockchain website from her lumia 520, I felt so frustated to tell her she just couldn't do it with WP..........!!
 
BTW access to coinbase and blockchain from WP is just shit. You either can't log in or have your screen stutter at every new transaction (for blockchain).
Seriously is there a real technical reason for not having this? Or do we just knee-jerk WP users??

I like the idea, and it seems that most problems raised by others in this thread can be solved.
-&gt; blockchain reorg: wait for x block confirmations
-&gt; multiple transactions outputs: craft a single-output transaction with a small and recoverable amount for the purpose of creating the alias
-&gt; the use of "dash" characters (unfriendly to copy/paste): add a different symbol between block number and address height, such as *327329B766*. **I'd find it cool to use an "at B" (like @ but with "B"), so that we get something that *is* a bitcoin address, the same way we use @ for email addresses.**  
-&gt; mistyping aliases: people will tend to use aliases for small amounts and the "scary" but more robust btc addresses for bigger amounts. I think The user-friendliness brought by aliases beats the downside of very rarely loosing small amounts of btc.
I think this idea provides a very efficient and friendly way to communicate addresses. I already have the vision of ads (highway ads, in the subway, on newspaper..) bearing these aliases so you can buy stuff or give to charities as easily as you sent a sms.
Keep digging the idea!

It's not a prediction, it's a reference for comparison with actual bitcoin generation speed
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:57:55
Red line is daily bitcoin production with 10-min block generation time. Which leads to 2nd halving in december 2016.
Watch the blue line for actual daily bitcoin production, you'll see a sharp drop past July 9.

Sorry about that, which browser and version? Thanks

If you double the reward at each halving you end up with infinite money supply. Whereas scarcity is what gives a coin its value.
Mining is a competing process. Halving the reward will reduce the budget allocated to miners as a whole. The weak will disappear and after the dust settles, the remaining miners will get back to the same level of profitability as before.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:57:34
Ok I reformulate: halving  would have occured in late December 2016 considering a 10-minute block generation time since Bitcoin inception.
**Actual** halving  will occur on July 9th or 10th 2016 because actual block generation time is less than 10 minutes.

What's the difference between listening/non-listening nodes ? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:57:22
I don't know how all this connects, but the shaddy emergence of Bytecoin is mentionned in this very awesome story: 
The tl;dr is that Bytecoin has been released with a purposedly de-optimized mine,r which made possible to fake blockchain history and/or have a big profitability advantage in mining.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:54:45
Definitely **not** a game changer. Look closer, this is *pre-order* for *Shipping begins in March 2018* (
And specs not that impressive compared to the S9...which is 18 months old :-)
And that's only if they deliver...

@_date: 2015-07-09 11:27:51
Ok thanks that makes sense. 
And let's say a specific coin is used as a transaction's input. This coin would be marked as "spent" as soon as the transaction is accepted to the mempool, right?
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:03:12
Noob question: Does a node verify mempool transactions against each other for double-spendings? Because with 80,000 transactions in the backlog that could become tedious. 
Let's say there are 1000 spam transactions in the mempool, with their inputs taken from a unique btc address. The node would have to check that the sum of these inputs doesn't exceed the sum of UTXOs associated with this address. And check again for any new incoming transaction linked to this address.
Is it how it works? I guess there have to be some verification in the mempool, otherwise you could inflate the mempool with spam transactions for free.

You're right, we sacrificed a little bit of the precision in order to show what the increase rate looks like. It's just easier to visualize a continuous evolution rather than a counter that takes a step every 10 minutes on average..! 
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:38:19
Good idea indeed
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:26:20

Don't feel bad, trading bitcoin is okay to me...as long as you don't lose all your money and become a buttcoin troll ;-p
As for guessing the halving date, it depends on mining activity. We just saw a huge increase in difficulty in the last few months so I wouldn't be surprised if it calmed down a little bit.. I would personally bet on a limited difficulty increase until the halving with slightly less than 10-min block generation time, which would lead to a halving date in early July.
But regarding the volatily you might be disappointed! Not much happened on the last Halving Day...
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:35:57
Well..come back for block  to figure it out ;-)
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:15:12
Hey, the "actual bitcoin inflation" in counted in btc/day. We look at how many blocks are produced every day using the timestamp in the block headers. Multiply that by the block reward to get the number of newly created btc per day.

Thanks for your comments! We'll keep adding new stuff until the halving. Feedback is welcome!!
@_date: 2016-02-26 07:12:14
We wanted to give a sense of the increase rate ("how much time to create 1 bitcoin?") and it's easier to visualize it with a continuous evolution. But you're right that's not exactly how new bitcoins are generated!
Noted the typo, thanks a lot for the feedback!

Against the average block time that is set in Bitcoin protocol: 10 minutes per block.
