And how many people use those banks?
BTC's used by a few million people, at most? And with those million people, most are hodling or trading, contributing minimal valuable economic activity.
Banks are used by let's say 5 billion people ... 
And do you think the entire banking sector uses more electricity that Ireland?
So either way you look at it really?

Lol, citation needed. There's just no way that is true.


They can, but that doesn't make it good for the environment. Electricity production has unpriced environmental externalities. You are paying for the cost of production, not the cost to the environment.

\&gt; concern as to how more energy needs to be used to secure BTC if the price increases 
Where did I say anything about that?
Can you be more specific about what you believe? You seem to be saying that dollar for dollar the cost to secure fiat is the same as the cost to secure bitcoin.
There are obvious examples where this doesn't make sense (eg Bitcoin and New Zealand have a similar market cap, but the whole country of New Zealand uses less energy than Bitcoin and only a fraction of that energy goes into "securing" fiat). 
You've waived this away with something-something America something-something, so I'm trying another example:
Bitcoin energy usage steadily increases over time as miners fight to increase their share of the block rewards. Compared to 2 years ago, Bitcoin now uses 14x more electricity but the price is only 4x. So your argument doesn't seem to hold up there either?
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:22:10
Good point, thanks for the contribution.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:05:16






You can say that, but there's no money leaving my account ... banks in Australia need to disclose all their fees and there's strict fines against "hidden fees", so you're really actually not paying fees.


Lol, this is equivalent of saying: I'd encourage you to read up on "engineering" and how "mechanical systems" work. You wanna be any more specific?
Obviously banks, the same as most private companies, have a profit motive. They don't need to make money on charging fees on checking accounts though, they'll make money on other products they offer, and in the difference in the interest rate they offer. That doesn't make it less free.

I guess the problem for me with TA is that adversarial markets are a zero sum game, so there's no such thing as a long term trading strategy. For any successful trading strategy you find, there's a way to counter that trading strategy so that they make the money instead.
To take an example that someone posted today: If the market usually pops when the 50 day moving average crosses the 3 day moving average, then you'd naturally buy in anticipation of that event and sell afterwards. But when everyone starts doing that, then actually you want to buy before everyone else and sell once they start buying. And so on, and so forth.
Worse, because Bitcoin is illiquid, unregulated, and small cap, the actions of a few big players can have a massive impact on the price far outweighing normal market dynamics. All exchanges have been beset by scandals, eg front running, bots, trading on their own order book, etc. So you're not just playing against other players you're playing against the house.
If you're a day trader using TA strategies you found on the internet, you may be picking up pennies in front of a steam roller \[1\]. It works while it works and then you lose your shirt. For most people posting here they are kidding themselves to think they are doing anything more than gambling.

You’re copping flak because every day people post crap like “oh whales keeping the price so they can acquire more” like there’s red button they can push to drop the price.
Ostensibly the only way to change the price is by buying or selling, so if you think about it for more than a few seconds, the espoused theory is that whales are selling their BTC to crash the price and then buying equal or additional quantities at the lower price, which ignores the corresponding increase in price as the market reacts to the sudden demand. More importantly it assumes there is like one whale trading at a time, or that all the whales are best friends.
In reality if some whale crashes the price then its in the interest of a different whale to do a big buy order - capitalising on the other guys risky move to make the money himself.
And that’s why it doesn’t really make sense that an institution would risk customer money to try and drive the price down, just to repurchase the same asset on an open market with extreme volatility where there’s a high probability of losing out.

Right now BTC inflation exceeds USD inflation (until next halving) so it’s actually more inflationary than most currencies.
This is just fact. If you’re trying to spin it to avoid losing face, stop.

But you didn't really address it, did you? You can't just blindly apply this formula and make hand waiving arguments that it all balances out somehow.
Bitcoin's energy usage grows every day, so if your argument is that securing fiat has the same cost, what happens in 12 months time? The cost to secure Bitcoin has doubled, but there's been no change in securing fiat. Doesn't that suggest that maybe you're not understanding the limitations of that formula?
And, why can't you just say BTC is bad for the environment? We may decide that it's worth it, but it's still bad.

It sounds like you're agreeing with me but I'm not really sure? People in 1826 could only dream of the lifestyles that minimum wage workers in the USA have. They are on minimum wage but you better believe they have a flatscreen TV or two and a car.
(Don't get me wrong, not saying that life isn't a struggle for a lot of people out there, but it's a very different struggle to those in 1826 could relate to).
Talking about multi-generational purchasing power doesn't really mean anything.
Rising inequality is a real problem, but that problem has very little to do with inflation, and it's not going to be fixed by Bitcoin (or any other "sound money").
And I mean this literally, not as a put down or raining generic poo-poo on the proverbial parade.

Energy isn't some soft concept like economics ... BTC uses the same amount of energy as Ireland, a country of 5M people.
There's not even a suggestion that the global banking industry uses that much electricity ... and even if it did, to evaluate this properly you'd need to look at per-person energy usage. Once you do that, BTC's energy usage becomes even more ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:12:43


It's very hard to be clear about what you're claiming here ... I assume that you're saying the USA/NATO are footing the energy bill for securing New Zealand's currency.
Pretty abstract but sure, let's move onto my second example?
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:42:39
There's only been small improvements to efficiency over the last 24 months, so no, they are not "far more efficient". And just because a new generation of miner comes out, doesn't mean that everyone dumps their old hardware ... the effect of releasing a miner that was a 50% improvement would only have at most single digit impact to the overall efficiency over 24 months.
But it doesn't matter. Even if energy efficiency doubled your formula still wouldn't make sense, there'd still be a 7x increase in energy usage.
And in a further 24 months, the energy usage of Bitcoin will be even higher ... if not 10x more you have to admit it's probably at least double. And fiat will still be using roughly the same energy it was 5 years ago.
You have to admit, this is a major flaw in your argument and proves that fiat and PoS are likely more efficient than PoW.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:09:09
Ah, so just your generic troll then.
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:38:52
You seem to be avoiding explaining the example I gave:
Bitcoin energy usage steadily increases over time as miners fight to increase their share of the block rewards. Compared to 2 years ago, Bitcoin now uses 14x more electricity but the price is only 4x.
So where is the corresponding increase in energy from securing fiat if MC = MR?

@_date: 2019-07-06 10:14:14
Good question.
The catastrophic failure scenario is a failure in the protocol that couldn’t be fixed, eg quantum computing breaking our fundamental assumptions ... this would probably wipe Bitcoin out.
The other scenario is that some other currency wins, and BTC slowly becomes obsolete over a decade, trading volume drops and people slowly give up hope and sell out. I don’t think this is likely but I guess Libra represents a legit threat in this model.
I think the most recent price jump is really significant- it validates BTC as long term speculative instrument (or a gambling instrument). It’s come back from a big crash with no real change in fundamentals, so I feel there’s quite a lot of confidence that it can recover from anything now. That means it’s not going anywhere soon.

Look at the growth in hash rate: [
That's a 14x increase in energy usage. By your logic, there would have to be a corresponding 14x increase of energy in securing fiat over that same time period? The way you're trying to use that formula does not make sense.
I watched the video - he's talking very hypothetically - I am sure there are some situations where BTC is only using excess energy but the impact is still massive.

- No one can force miners to upgrade if there is a “hard” change to the protocol. 7 entities control 75% of the hashrate, which means they can effectively veto any change. This means they have control over **some** aspects of Bitcoin. True or False?

So for how many people is Bitcoin really solving a problem for as a Store of Value?
Let's say it doesn't really solve problems for the upper and middle classes, and the middle-lower class. These workers all receive annual CPI increases or have investments that outperform inflation.
There's going to be a set of jobs for which this isn't the case at the very bottom. This bottom end does not have savings (by definition) so it's not their savings that are getting "robbed", I assume you mean they are being robbed because their purchasing power does not keep up if their wages aren't increased each year?
For Bitcoin to actually help these people, they would need to be paid in Bitcoin right? Simply having access to Bitcoin doesn't help because they are living paycheque to paycheque so converting to BTC and back to fiat each month would actually cost them more.
So we're talking about a timeline where both a) people are paid entirely in bitcoin and b) bitcoin is no longer deflationary, the latter (and likely, former) of which won't be in your lifetime.

You realise there's like 1000 alt-coins out with similarly limited supply there that are already at 0? Scarcity doesn't create implicit value, it's very easy to create a limited number of things that people don't want.
For example: If bitcoin gets superseded (by some other technology that ends up being better at being a currency or a store of value) the only logical price will be zero (or close to) because there will be no demand for it (except maybe a small army of eccentric hodlers trying to ‘collect em all’).

Each miner may choose to either sell at a loss to cover repayments on their equipment investment (marginally increasing supply), or hold onto their coins in the hope the price goes up (marginally decreasing supply).
If the price does go up then the miners dump the coins they held back which increases supply and decreases the price.
So price may go up, price may go down, story of bitcoin. Hashrate is a side effect of price not a driver.
@_date: 2018-09-11 04:12:45
Looks like the hashrate is following the price to me? Which actually makes logical sense - as price goes up it's more profitable to mine and thus people invest in mining. This is such a simple explanation. Why would it work the other way around?
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:06:59
No, its a chicken and egg network effect problem. There is no benefit to employers to pay their staff in BTC and no benefit to employees to convert their paycheque into BTC to buy things with.
You need motivation on both sides for this to work - and the inflation boogeyman isn't a motivator for people at the bottom end of the wealth spectrum because when you break it down Bitcoin doesn't really solve a problem for them.
And it's not going to suddenly start solving a problem for them until they get paid in BTC, which isn't going to happen because no one is spending it so the business would have to buy BTC OTC and that's going to cost them dearly because of the scarcity. Chicken and egg.
You talk about Bitcoin as a solution to people living paycheque to paycheque - it's just not. Employers need to pay a living wage.

It's hard to argue with true believers because once defeated on the technical merits they'll move onto the ad-hominem attacks or say they "couldn't be bothered reading any more". To summarise:
1. Scarity creates implicit value thus Bitcoin can't possibly go to zero. False - look at all the shitcoins.
2. Shitcoins only don't have implicit value because they aren't sound money. False - the only thing truly unique to bitcoin is adoption.
3. Adoption is not a design property. False - adoption is built into the core of bitcoin itself, both in its role as money (one person gives, one person which is a built in mechanism common to all money) and at the heart of the mining process which was designed to spread adoption across the largest group of individuals possible.
"Soundness" is ultimately a nothing word, but we can safely say that bitcoin is not "sound money" yet because:
\- it's not widely adopted as a means for purchasing goods and services,
\- the price is wildly unstable,
\- frankly it may not technically scale to a point a whole country can use it (waiting 15 minutes for a confirmation is not going to be viable and off-chain scaling is still in beta but looks promising),
\- there's no central bank, governance or regulation (which may be a feature not a bug, time will tell).
And with that, I bid you good day sir.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:37:52
Okay so why would "long term, non speculative investment of miners" affect the bitcoin price?
Again, price is the meeting point of supply and demand. If there's more people that want to sell bitcoin than buy bitcoin, the price goes down until the demand levels out. If there's more people that want to buy than sell, the price goes up.
This confluence happens on an exchange. The price between exchanges is mediated by arbitrage, which uses the same buy/sell mechanism to keep the price as close together as possible.
So where does "long term, non speculative investment of miners" come into this interaction? How can they possibly affect the exchange price?
Obviously, it doesn't. Miners spend money in the hope that the coins they have minted can be sold in the future for enough fiat to cover the costs of their business operation and make some profit. They are betting on the bitcoin price increasing, not causing it.

The reason they HAVE (not had) a lot of influence is because six large miners/pools make up more than 75% of the hashing power ([ These six entities can dictate whether any hard change to the protocol will be accepted or not.

Yes totally agree - there are many challenges to adoption that go beyond the technology, which is why it can be a bit naive to advocate for crypto in a developing country if you haven't lived it.
Setting up physical money changing locations will probably happen, but these are still barriers to adoption. You need to trust the person will actually send you BTC which implies at least a basic understanding of the tech. More importantly the money changer needs to trust they aren't going to be robbed at gunpoint.
Despite it's petro-abundance there's multi-day queues for gas in Venezuela. Can you even imagine that? It's hard to believe if you haven't been there. So if you're not sure when you'll be able to get gas again, are you going to use half a tank driving to Caracas to deposit money, that you'd need to drive back to Caracas to get out the next month? Will the money changer still be there?
I travelled across the whole country on a motorbike a few years ago just when things started to get dicey, and it was already pretty tough - I cannot even imagine the hardships most Venezuelans are facing right now - but I can say with confidence Crypto's probably the last thing on their minds.
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:32:22
But what about Bitcoin2, or Bitcoin3? If Bitcoin scarity is only in the first mover advantage, how long will that be relevant?
The alt bubble was larger than BTC only a few months ago, so clearly first mover is not the sole criteria.
Bitcoin adoption eg replacing money means all vendors having payment terminals that accept BTC. What is to stop the software provider rolling out an update to accept the top 100 cryptos seamlessly (like Coinbase)?
Also, does 21 million even matter as a “whole” unit when the indivisible unit is a satoshi? I guess “Only so many people can have a 100 million satoshi’s” does not have the same ring to it?

Literally yes.
Do a thought experiment- what if mining hashrate increases by 1000% over the next month. Supply changes slightly, demand is not affected. Does this affect price? Why would it?
You can ask “why did hashrate increase”? Maybe mining became more profitable because a more efficient ASIC came online or electricity costs dropped, or the price sky rockets. In the latter case these things are affected by the price, not the other way around.

Why do you say miners all did not want SegWit? They all signalled for it: 
There is no way around their veto power - a hard change requires them to update their code - and no one can force that.
So the OP is fundamentally wrong: miners are not disposable because they cannot be fired, and a handful of miners have total veto power over any hard-changes to the protocol. Sounds like control to me.
@_date: 2018-09-20 02:30:42
Haha, sounds like someone is a little too invested in this to be objective and not resort to personal attacks.
You're backing yourself into a corner on the wording of "disposable and replaceable" ... no matter how you define "we" (the community, core devs, majority of bitcoin users) cannot "replace" one miner for another. We cannot "dispose" of one miner we don't like. That is not within our power.
Also you seem confused about the word "hard". For anyone else reading along "hard" comes from "hard fork", a change to the bitcoin protocol which requires miners to update to avoid creating a parallel chain. Other changes to the protocol are defined as "soft".
I'm guessing "Cryptolution" doesn't understand this which is why he's having a hard time understanding that miners can exert control over Bitcoin. Segwit is a great example where the larger community clearly wanted a change that was good for bitcoin, but it took years to overcome resistance from miners whose economic incentives temporarily diverged from the rest of the community. Eventually, and only when they completely agreed, was the community able to adopt the change and move on.
This is where the "security guards at a tech company" analogy falls apart. A more apt analogy is "heavily unionised workers on a production line that cannot be fired and can block management from making any changes".
We can dress it up however we like, but that's the reality.

There is a massive philosophical difference. Frankly you would have to have your head up your arse to not see it.
In the stock market you buy a share of a revenue producing asset. Each share entitles you to a portion of the profit that entity returns each year, and a return in the event the company is sold. This gives a fundamental value to each share.
The price of each share is its speculative value. This speculation prices in whether the market thinks the fundamentals of the company will improve and at what rate.
Bitcoin is just speculative. The only value in holding a coin is to exchange it, either for fiat or a greater fool. There is no fundamental value underpinning the price.
This is a very large philosophical difference.
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:47:21
Sure, but most of the employers at the bottom (eg Walmart) are still doing wage increases at or above the rate of inflation.
The point of my post is not to say that there are not some people that suffer from inflation - but to say that MOST people do not suffer - because MOST people don't have substantial savings they keep out of the banking system.
They either spend what they earn, keep money in the bank where the interest rate is at or above the rate of inflation, or they purchase a major asset like a house.

I think you're kidding yourself not calling a 20x increase in price (lead by demand and backed by global media exposure) a boom-bust cycle.
The dot-com bubble peaked at 1.7T ([ Crypto peaked at .8T ([ before crashing to less than half of that value.
The high water mark there is close to 50% of the biggest boom in history. Can you think of any other booms since the dot-com that came close?
I hear what you're saying re Bitcoin not being the company but the platform - but that's my point. If bitcoin is the internet and we've already had our first crash, what did we get from it? There's nothing built on the blockchain that produces meaningful revenue yet as far as I know? (except exchanges, they are the ISPs in this example - get rich selling shovels).

This often gets cited but it's just not that simple. If the money supply has doubled, we would expect things to cost significantly more right?
Have things doubled in price? Have you noticed that your purchasing power is significantly lower now than in 2008? Probably not, because it's not that simple:  
Most importantly: Did you earn all your money in 2008 and keep it under your bed until now? If not, then each year you likely received a pay rise from your employer which \*at least\* offsets inflation. This means that inflation doesn't really affect you - in fact you probably benefit from it - because inflation encourages investment which means stronger economy, more jobs, etc.
If you did not receive a pay rise each year, then this sucks - it is tough in the USA for people at the bottom - and maybe there's a rightful place for you here complaining about inflation and speculating on bitcoin. For everyone else (which is the vast majority) inflation is a strawman.

Bitcoin is inflationary and will be long after you are dead. You've said you can't wait ... I guess you mean that literally?
I'm not being snarky, but how is that a major selling point for you? Most people are paid in wages that are adjusted for inflation each year. For inflation to seriously affect you, you would need to have your life savings in cash in a box under your bed. Do you have life savings already?
 
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:09:53
Sorry, sometimes it's hard not to be a little snarky when relatively wealthy westerners (I'm just guessing from your comment) talk about what they'd do if they grew up in a developing country.
Obviously it depends on just how close to the bottom you are, Crypto isn't going to work when you don't have a smartphone or access to the internet. It's not going to work if you don't have a reliable banking system you trust to get your money in and out of crypto, and don't trust bitcoin ATMs to be there long term. It's not going to work if betting on crypto and it losing 75% of its value puts you onto the street. It's not going to work if you need to buy actual food to live on at a moments notice. For these people USD is a much safer bet - everyone has access to it, everyone accepts it, and the value of it doesn't fluctuate wildly.
That's probably why the total investment from Venezuela has been so small (barely 500 BTC / week for 31 million people) despite the tragic situation in the country.
This is not to say that BTC doesn't solve a problem for a certain strata of society, but your problems are very different to their problems.
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:58:15
Just to be pedantic it's not an investment, it's a speculative bet based on scarcity.
When a fund or investor buys shares in a company or property, they are buying a small portion of a revenue producing asset.
This is the as buying USD or gold. You're not investing in USD, you're hedging or speculating or both.

Yeah but how do the employers get it? It's this chicken and egg network effect problem that really stands in the way. In my view that's why we'll never see utopian-style adoption, because Bitcoin holdings are too concentrated for any meaningful adoption.
Let's say Venezuela decides to adopt Bitcoin and mandates a minimum wage of 1BTC/month. All employers in Venezuela (a country of 31 million people) now need to buy at least a months supply of BTC. This pushes the price up so high it's simply not achievable.
You can keep changing the thought experiment to smaller and smaller adopters but you end up at the same result - any serious adoption makes a small number of people unfathomably rich - and no one who has any choice in the matter is going to let that happen.

@_date: 2018-09-07 21:26:13
Hashrate represents a component of *supply*, not demand.
The price is the meeting point of supply and demand.
The bitcoin protocol adjusts difficulty to ensure a block is mined roughly at the same rate regardless of hash power.
So hashrate has little to do with supply, and nothing to do with demand, and thus nothing to do with the price.

\&gt; Adoption has nothing to do with soundness.
You want to think about that a little?
We're talking about Bitcoin as a \*currency\*, which the dictionary defines as "a system of money in general use in a particular country.". Adoption has everything to do with soundness, because if Bitcoin has no adoption it's not a currency at all.
Which, currently, it's not. It's speculative instrument that some early adopters occasionally use to purchase things. Except they aren't really purchasing things in Bitcoin because the items are still priced in fiat. In this case Bitcoin is just the transaction layer ... which -- don't get me wrong -- is still really cool.
But it's not "sound money" when it's lost 70% of it's value in six months. It's just not.
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:16:32
This is a terrifying glimpse into people investing money into things they completely misunderstand.
The \*rate\* of supply of new coins halves every 4 years.
So if demand does not increase the price of bitcoin will FALL consistently. There needs to be 10M USD injected into Bitcoin EVERY DAY just for bitcoin to keep its current price (that is the supply of new coins mined each day which must then be sold for miners to profit).
Yes - that means bitcoin is actually inherently inflationary, and will be long after we are dead.
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:22:01
The point is the data is NOT in the blockchain, which is what everyone else in here that understands Bitcoin is saying. 
There is no way to know what the actual transaction vs trade volume is, but it clearly pretty small compared to VISA because no one can even anecdotally suggest a place where any significant volume might be happening.
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:13:18
Right, but what I'm saying is "buy and hold" even at the scale of some hedge funds may not lead to a dramatically higher price. Bitcoin is a speculative investment which means there's no fundamental price that keeps going up, which means demand needs to outpace supply constantly for the price to rise. A few big buy-ins do little for adoption long term. What's the end game for Bitcoin if it's a store of value? How many people have a legitimate need for a store of value solution given the majority of the world population doesn't have substantial savings?

You're looking at commerce and assuming the merchant sets the price by looking at their costs and adding a few percent for profit margin.
Most retailers don't operate this way - they set out to make as much profit as possible within the market they operate in.
Do you think that onesie you bought online was $99.95 because the merchant was paying 0.5% to VISA, and 1.25% to PayPal, and 4% to American Express? No. It's set because that's what people would pay for them.
The other major flaw in your thinking is thinking that merchants have influence on the means of payment. You think merchants like chargebacks? No, they hate them, but merchants will accept whatever payment method consumers prefer so that they can maximise their sales. Consumers trust VISA and MasterCard because if the item they order doesn't arrive or is different to what they expected, the consumer gets their money back easily.
What you're actually paying for is TRUST.
I know when I order from JennysOnlineSexEquipment.com - even though it's my first purchase with this company and the website looks a little shady - I'll get what I order or I get my money back.
VISA and MasterCard charge a surcharge for TRUST, not brokering a payment, and merchants will pay this any day of the week.

Also there are very few jobs in the bitcoin space – The sheer majority of jobs are for projects creating their own token.

Sorry what? What is Bitcoin catching on faster than? We can't even get Segwit adoption meaningfully past 50%. Volume is flat over last 12 months and down over last 2 years. Number of merchants accepting BTC is 0.0% of total merchants (think about that). There's no killer app. Payments UX still sucks and is way behind things like Apple Pay.
This is a great graph that looks at the adoption of new technology over time: [
As we become a more modern society, adoption speed has rapidly increased. It took 40 years for half of households to have a washing machine, but less than 10 years for half of households to own a tablet / iPad.
Bitcoin's not even on that chart ... maybe we're looking at 10% of households for the purpose of rampant speculation and get-rich-quick ideas, and 1% for societally or economically useful activity.
Bitcoin's not catching on because it's not solving a problem most people know or care about.
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:43:11


That is such a weasily statement, and your credibility in this subreddit is rapidly approaching 0.
Visa and Mastercard are for buying things. Bitcoin volume is mostly bots trading with bots. Lots of activity, very little value.
Do a thought experiment: There’s like 500 merchants accepting lightning? A few thousand stores accepting Bitcoin payments? What do you think actual BTC spend on goods and services is? Honestly it can’t be more than $100M annually ... just going back to fundamentals, BTC clogs up at 7 transactions/sec.
VISA alone does $2 Trillion in TPV each quarter. 1700 transactions per second.
Not even close mate.

If there's not a single real world metric that you can name to explain your positivity about the growth, but you "just know it's there" and believe that growth is faster than any other technology, then that's your own little bubble.

Yeah they are selling their coins at a discount to drop the price so they can buy more coins when the price drops? Genius plan!
Except the price rises as they start buying the coins back, or another investor takes advantage of the coins at a discount and buys instead - so this makes absolutely no sense and continues to be the dumbest theory floating around on this subreddit.
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:27:02
I don't think you're being intellectually honest here ... this is what you said:
**Bitcoin is catching on so much faster than other technologies in history**
Define "catching on" and then list which technologies for which Bitcoin is "catching on" faster.
Store of value:  
\- Is BTC catching on as a store of value? Well not really ... wild price swings make it a terrible store of value right now.
Currency:  
\- Is BTC catching on? No, not really ... and it's catching on slower than most counterparts (Apple Pay, Ali Pay, M-pesa).
Speculative instrument:  
\- Is BTC catching on? Sure there's some activity but volume is trending DOWN so no, it's not "catching on". Bakkt is doing as whole $12m per day (which is so low its almost meaningless compared to any other recognised speculative instrument). Is it beating other technologies in the "speculative instrument" space? I mean it's certainly not beating new financial instruments like CDS's in volume (which is in the trillions).
So what exactly are you claiming? People keep talking about "investment in the space" and "building out global infrastructure" but this is building capacity for adoption that doesn't exist yet ... you can't point to that stuff and say "oh look at adoption".

It's hard not to make fun of - literally every thing that happens to crypto or BTC has someone explaining why it's a good for BTC.
Tether likely pushed up the price, potentially through 2B of fake liquidity, but also because it provided a stable trading pair that enabled a whole new class of trader.
Now it's crashing and that's good for BTC too ... I don't know if I buy it. We saw a nice little pump which has mostly evaporated, and overall trust in the ecosystem drops to a new low.
Anyway, maybe you're right, but it's a trope now so it's going to attract some eye rolls.

The *efficient market* hypothesis says that prices fully reflect all available information in the market.
If the market believed that $100k/coin by 2021 ([your prediction here]( was realistic, then the price would not be hovering around $6k. So we can say with confidence: the market disagrees with you.

That's my point. You live in a little bubble that doesn't reflect reality. You're painting this picture of worldwide adoption "faster than any other comparable technology" that just isn't true by any metric you can imagine.
There's 16,000 Crypto jobs posted in 2019 on LinkedIn, a 2% increase on 2018. That's NOT "fast" growth. That's barely growth at all.
As a comparison, there are 7.7 MILLION jobs in renewables.
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:44:34


But most people do, and if you have enough money where losing 3% each year is a significant amount, then you've already solved this problem by investing in the sharemarket, bonds, property, etc all of which outperform inflation.
Who are these supposed people that keep significant amounts of money under the bed for 10 years?
Also, Bitcoin is inflationary until well after you're dead. Bitcoin inflation is 3.87% at the moment, worse than most developed countries. You seem awfully excited about a totally hypothetical benefit.
Also you talk about the stock market as risky ... did you miss the part where bitcoin lost 75% of its value over the last 12 months?

And you’re betting that BTC is a hedge, which might not be true (eg yesterday purchasing power of BTC dropped more than the stock market dropped).

There's no fundamental price. The price is set on an exchange. You can invent a coin right now and mine it, so it can have hashrate and no price, or price and no hashrate if you really wanted (pre-mined), but that is a totally meaningless argument.
We're talking about Bitcoin's price on an exchange, and the associated hashrate. In this case, the hashrate follows the price as people are chasing the return on mined coins.

Think of it this way. For hashrate to increase a miner orders hardware, someone needs to build the hardware, then the miner needs to set up data centers and negotiate electricity prices etc. This cycle is probably 6+ months.
They are speculating that if they spend $x now they will get eg $1.5x later.
When you are looking at hashrate increasing now, you are looking at the culmination of bets made 6+ months ago. A bet from some miners a while ago that the price will go up.
Likely those bets are NOT paying off right now as the price is lower than the energy costs in many places.
So hashrate doesn’t push the price up. Hashrate reacts to the price. It doesn’t tell you anything about the future price.
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:18:24

That sounds like a complete reversal on your original proposition to me?
Speak to an engineer about boundary conditions. They are the part of the model where the general formula breakdown. Arguing about what followed what when the price was zero makes NO sense.
That said, if you want to play stupid games and win stupid prizes, yes - satoshi started mining before there was a market for bitcoin. Perhaps he set the price arbitrarily at that point, we'll never know. We'll never need to know, because it's a stupid argument.
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:01:17
But do members of the general public care about "accurate tamper proof ledger"?
@_date: 2018-10-25 06:49:46
The minute before satoshi mined the first coin literally the opposite of what you are saying was true: both hashrate and price were 0.
Why are you arguing about boundary conditions? You have been so thoroughly debunked that hashrate leads price I don’t understand what you are clinging to now?
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:28:40

You started with what sounded like an interesting point but you then went on to explain what is essentially supply and demand.
Price at any point in time is the equilibrium  between what people are willing to sell for, and buy at.

I think you make a good point here. There is always “better” and always neighsayers who don’t get it.
I struggle to see how it gets better than Apple Pay (touch your phone to the paywave reader and you’re done) but I guess it is possible.
Something like Bakkt could add purchase insurance via a small fee, giving consumers the same level of protection they get now, and readers/apps to bring it up to ease of use parity.
I guess it is possible the fees could be lower because there are less middlemen, but I don’t often see a discount for paying with cash so I’m not convinced about that.
I guess this is your point - but I just don’t see how it gets better for consumers from here.

These people speculating that the price will jump up shortly after the halvening push the price up now. When we hit the halvening there’s a 50-50 chance the price goes up and down (efficient market hypothesis). If the price doesn’t jump, speculators sell to cut their losses, pushing the price down.
@_date: 2018-10-27 11:16:44
Haha, no it doesn’t because there was no “market price”, because the market didn’t exist yet.
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:30:51
If I needed the $50 bucks because I borrowed the money to buy a shovel, I'd sell for $50.
I would, of course, like $100 bucks ... but I don't set the price. And worse, every day that goes past I am paying interest on the loan I took to buy hardware. So every day that I don't sell, I'm risking that the price goes down and my situation worsens, or that the price stays flat and I'm losing money on interest or electricity.
That means that when the price increases even slightly, I am heavily incentivised to sell. This is similar to the prisoners dilemma - I should withhold my bitcoins from the market to drive the price up, this is good for all miners. However, I have costs to cover, so I should dump my mined coins into the market before another miner does. This may be an explanation for the sudden drops we see whenever the price inches up.
So while you might be right if miners acted as a single entity and miners could afford to hold indefinitely, this is not the case.

You don’t understand how being a merchant works so you’re confused. You might also be stuck in a crypto good news bubble, so disenting opinions make your room spin.
In the traditional system you have a payment processor and a bank. You can see your money in the payment processor instantly, but it only hits your bank account the next day.
This is the same as Bitcoin: you can receive the payment instantly but if you want to cash it out into fiat you’ll need to wait several days for an exchange. As a merchant, right now, Bitcoin is thus slower than VISA.
One day, maybe, the merchant can pay his bills and his suppliers in BTC. Then he will have a nice advantage (no chargebacks and instant clearing) but my guess is this will never take off. Instead, there will be a middleman that offers consumer protections and anti-fraud for a small fee. Merchants will gladly use this because it will increase trust and lead to more sales. Maybe the scales will tip more toward the merchant, maybe not, we will see.

So how do you buy food and other essentials- are people accepting bitcoin in exchange for food?
@_date: 2018-10-07 09:49:17
Yes, the merchant is paying the 1-3% fees. Also, if you have any reasonable volume the fees are fractions of a percent.
Does your supermarket offer you a 1% discount to use cash? No? Doesn't seem like a good argument then.
And no, VISA doesn't have any annual charge. Your bank MAY charge an annual fee if you want a reward card (where you're getting points or other junk).
@_date: 2018-10-03 10:30:55
Yeah but consumers don't care about what payment method the merchant would prefer, and the merchant wants to make a sale.
Consumers want to pay with VISA, Mastercard, or Paypal because the buyer protections are strong. If the goods don't arrive or aren't what you expected, you get your money back -- and even better, all of these protections don't appear to cost you anything.
Do we really think VISA or Mastercard couldn't offer a zero-fee card without fraud protection? Of course they could, but they won't, because that's not what consumers want.

If you were pitching that as a startup I'd be pretty confused about how big your target market is.
The way you've described it is "a currency for people that are breaking the law.". I assume that's what "censorship resistant" means, given only the government can make laws about money.
That's great, and obviously a boon for people living under oppressive regimes (where those regimes do not align with our western values). It might also be a boon for people living under oppressive regimes whose values do not align with our values, eg. does ISIS see themselves as oppressed? Probably. I guess we take the good with the bad.
Still, not sure how big that target market is.

Immutable data has been around since computers. CDROMs were immutable. That’s not what blockchains solve.
If “true ownership of digital assets” is the most important innovation in your life, frankly your life is weird. Please explain how your life has been dramatically impacted by slightly improved gold, or slightly improved currency — more than the invention of the internet, social networking platforms, electric cars, private space exploration — it might be a bit early to call yet given we have had it 10 years and you can’t do anything now you couldn’t do before some other way.

Of course it can be priced in, how ignorant can you be?
Lets say that supply right now is eg 50% lower than it would be otherwise because everyone is waiting for “institutional demand”. Then bakkt opens, and the price stays the same either because they buy OTC from a huge surplus of coins miners haven’t been able to sell, or relatively low demand, or high demand but absorbed by the market - that means it was priced in.
Guess what happens next? It drops. Because after all the anticipation no one is getting rich quick and they jump ship.
Why do you think it is impossible? Because we don’t know what the demand might be? No, but lots of people are guessing. They are making decisions based on those guesses. That means it is priced in! As an example half the people in this sub are holding in hopes of a sudden boom from institutional money. When it doesn’t happen they will sell.
Time will tell - either it was accurately priced or it wasn’t - but you have a fundamental misunderstanding of markets if you think it cannot be priced in.

But seriously, why would a consumer care that someone else is paying the fee? If you had a choice between paying the fee and the merchant paying the fee, why would you pay it?
And don't say that the fees are built into the price already ... maybe they are, maybe they aren't, but unless vendors start offering a 1% discount to pay with Bitcoin it doesn't matter.

Chargebacks are a pain in the arse, but it's a cost of doing business that merchants accept because at the end of the day consumers overwhelmingly want to pay using VISA or MasterCard.
The consumers choose VISA or MasterCard because they want the guarantee that at the end of the day they can always get their money back.
If you had a payment form that looked like this:
|VISA / MasterCard|1%|Get your money back if literally anything goes wrong|
|Bitcoin|0%|No protection|
What are consumers going to choose?
Another way of thinking about this: do we really think VISA/MasterCard couldn't offer a "low protection" service without chargebacks for a fraction of the cost if that was what the market wanted? If the fundamental cost of a transaction comes down to energy, Bitcoin uses like 10,000x more than VISA/MasterCard.

Each day new bitcoins are minted, the supply is increased, thus bitcoin is less scarce each day.
If you want to look at it through a market lens I'm not sure if I agree with your definition, but given the price has been stable for a few months, by definition supply is meeting current demand ... so still not scarce, and certainly not more scarce each day?

The post is about Bitcoin’s ability to function as a store of value - now and into the foreseeable future - not in some fantasy land 100 years in the future where it’s not a speculative instrument with wild price swings. That’s what the post is about.
BTC is currently, and will be probably for a significant portion of out lifetimes, a poor store of value. The trope “1btc = 1btc” is just totally meaningless in the context of real world purchasing power which is the only meaningful definition of store of value.

@_date: 2018-10-14 04:03:49
That’s just arbitrary lines on a graph though. You could draw them pointing in the other direction and say we are going to the moon, both would be meaningless.
Things that will move the market:
- sudden mass adoption of BTC by a country with currency problems, eg increased demand.
- an ETF approval AND a desire to buy BTC by institutions, eg increased demand.
- whales doing their thing with big selloffs, eg increased supply.
- miners doing their thing dumping huge amounts of coin on the market to cash out before another miner dumps theirs, eg increased supply.
- new technology that solves an actual problem, eg increased demand.
- slow and steady organic growth based on meeting a market need like Store of Value or fast cheap international payments, eg increased demand.
Arbitrary lines on a graph don’t predict this stuff. This market is too small, too irrational, too dominated by manipulation that would be illegal in other markets to think that price movements over the last year would have any predictive power.

Firstly holding a big chunk of Bitcoin doesn’t give them control over anything... why would it? Why would they care about decreasing the supply?
Secondly, they make investments to pay their bills. This means investments with yields like bonds and loans not highly erratic illiquid speculative investments that don’t provide interest (and any profit gets handed back to the US Treasury anyway).

I think you are taking the wrong lessons from history. The lesson you should be taking is that no one knows what will happen to the price, and most predictions are wrong.
The halving may be all that is propping the price up.
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:27:45
There's no evidence of that though, you're just making shit up and stating it as fact. It's entirely possible that everyone is desperately holding their BTC until after the halvening, and when the price doesn't pop they'll panic sell. This is not just a possibility, it's the most likely possibility ...
It's an educated market, everyone knows what the halvening is, and when it's going to happen. Supply is halving, so all other things being equal, we should expect the price to rise.
So, literally everyone knows this, and would thus buy and hold bitcoin expecting to benefit from this situation.
This drives the price up. That's called "being priced in".
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:36:58
I mean isn't it horse shit? I've explained why it's probably not even applicable to Bitcoin, there's literally no one who's predicted the price with any meaningful success that I am aware of. Almost every TA prediction posted in here goes to shit a few days later. How is it not horse shit?

I think you're seeing what you want to see. In Australia we have a realtime payments system: zero cost, instant transfer, instant settlement, with a PayID you can choose as your mobile number or email address. I believe you can (or will be able to) attach unlimited metadata to the payment like a JSON blob or PDF of the receipt.
Many countries have something similar, and [SWIFT is going realtime](
BTC on the other hand can have very high fees, can be extremely slow to get enough confirmations, and with your transaction recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see might not be as private as you think.
My point is not to trash BTC. But it's not solving a problem that most people have, and it's not solving it in a way that has significant advantages for the average person. It solves a niche for people living in oppressive regimes or buying drugs online, and it's a great speculative investment for people who got in early (maybe we're early enough who knows).

They don't "just add a 0" somewhere and money magically appears. They also don't "through inflation", that is an effect not an action. They \*could\* relax the fractional reserve restrictions but that's not going to cause hyperinflation.
Hyperinflation is almost always caused by printing buckets of money by desperate governments. The chance of that happening in the USA is similar to the chance of zombie apocalypse. If you want to plan for that, that's cool, but there's an equal chance coke bottle caps are going to be the post-apocalypse currency as BTC.

Because it's less than 13 hours old and it's already wrong, BTC is $10.23.
BTC is a low liquidity, highly manipulated, highly speculative market ... TA is about recognising patterns market dynamics, but that only matters when market dynamics are the overwhelming force.
The BRD's we see a regular basis are not a normal phenomena. The regularity shows how easily the price can be pumped or dumped. A market maker doesn't care about your TA. If there's money to be made pumping or dumping, that's what they will do. And in BTC, those moves have a massive impact on price that far outweighs the market dynamics.
Calling the bottom of a market based on beginner TA with any certainty is stupid, there's no dressing it up.

We all have two choices, we can look at the real problems blocking adoption, or stick our fingers in our ears and rock back and forth humming a little ditty and hoping for the best.
Bitcoin may be revolutionary, or it may end up like Google Glass and Virtual Reality -- once poised to usher in a new technological era but never realised -- because fundamentally they did not solve a big enough problem to get mass market adoption.
Venezuela's national currency is collapsing, they are a tech literate country with widespread access to the internet even in rural areas. If Bitcoin was a panacea shouldn't we be seeing some serious adoption there?

The answer you’re avoiding answering is “no, no one I have ever met has even heard of someone losing their savings”.
In the US, deposits are secured by the FDIC up to $100k per account.
No one has lost savings in the USA in modern financial history.
Bank runs are temporary liquidity problems. Fractional reserve banking is about how much cash you need to keep in hand, not inventing money or loaning out money you don’t have. BOA gets $2B in cash deposits, it can now loan $1.8B to people who want to buy houses. If everyone wants their money at the same time they are in trouble because they lent it to other people, and the FDIC steps in - but importantly it's a liquidity issue not a "we lent out fake money that never existed" issue.
Is the system foolproof? No, as we saw in the 2008 crash, there was systematic incentive for people to inflate the value of illiquid assets (like houses).
Is it safer than keeping your money in BTC? Well, the risks of BTC are pretty clear - massive price swings, loss of private key, theft of coins, etc all of which there is ZERO recourse.
If you want to take risks with your money, put it in BTC and hope for the best. Use BTC as part of a balanced investment strategy. Don't think that storing your money in BTC is a safe alternative to a bank account - that's just dumb.

It's not crazy talk. In actual stock markets with highly regulated exchanges, tremendous volume, and lots of retail investors there's still controversy about whether TA has any predictive value.
In a low volume, manipulated market, [where significant amounts of the volume appear to be fake]( it has literally zero value, because the pump and dump activity completely washes out any trends that TA is meant to help spot.
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:13:01
Right ... so you believe that any given central bank, at some point, will eventually just lose control of the money printing machines and start printing money uncontrollably.
In the USD's case, to achieve hyper inflation they would be printing half the total currency in circulation EACH MONTH. So $7 trillion the first month, $10.5 trillion the second month ... and so on.
So 140,000,000 pounds of cash in the first month. More the next month.
This is approximately the total weight of the Washington Monument, each month.

Because people think it means the price will go up the rational thing to do is buy in anticipation of the event. This drives the price up before the event, not on or after the event.
This means we could expect the price to go down in the short term. People expecting to get rich quick will sell when the price doesn’t rise.

And if you believe that, then it makes sense for a rational investor to buy \*\*before\*\* payday so they can catch the uplift. This pushes the price up \*\*before\*\* payday. Then it makes sense for other rational investors to buy before the other people buying before. This effectively nullifies this as a trading strategy.

The inflation rate of bitcoin is halved (BTC inflation will become slightly lower than the current USD inflation rate).
We will probably see a price crash, as many uninformed investors sell their BTC because they were expecting an immediate uplift and didn’t get one, similar to what happened with BAKT.
Most mining becomes unprofitable because the reward halves – difficulty will drop – but this won’t affect much.
As the supply of new coins is slightly lower as a percentage of the total number of bitcoins, all things being equal, we would expect the price to go up over the long term.
However, as bitcoin is a purely speculative instrument, whether it goes up or down long-term is a coin toss
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:24:54
Okay, you're right, that wasn't phrased correctly ... obviously they hold assets that don't have a yield (eg they are the largest holder of gold). The question was why would they buy an asset with no yield to stabilize their currency?
The fed buys assets to decrease the money supply. A fed reserve asset must be physical, controlled by policymakers, and must be easily transferable. Obviously BTC doesn't meet any of these criteria so it's more similar to bonds - but bonds would give you a yield - so the question was why would you pick BTC over bonds.

Satoshi owns around 1M BTC ($10B USD). In a distant reality, Satoshi could be waiting for the best moment to dump all his coins and cash out. This would crash the market (the market crashed hard when the gox coins were liquidated). It would be a strange long game but if it happened I think you’d call that a scam.

So when you say "Even a few years is significant." what you actually mean is "it might possibly be significant if we see runaway inflation like the 70s again" ...
You'll also note the 70s had super high interest rates. So again, it's only really true if you're holding significant amounts of cash in a box under your bed.
The point I'm making is that for most people whining about inflation like it's some sort of demonic entity snuffling up their money, it's just not.
Most people don't have any significant savings. Those that do have significant savings have them in a bank account that earns interest close to the rate of inflation, or investments that beat inflation like stocks, properties or bonds.
So who does that leave? People in Venezuela, and people that had large sums of money in cash under their bed. If you're not in this category, you're probably just being dramatic.

The key is fundamentals. If you buy stocks you own a share of a revenue producing asset, and depending on the share you will get paid dividends. If you buy a house, you own something that you can either live in or rent out.
When calculating the price of both of these asset classes, they have a fundamental value (eg a lower bound on value) based on future cashflow. 
BTC doesn't have that. It might be worth lots, it might be worth nothing. Owning it doesn't give you anything (rent, shelter or dividends).
On a spectrum of what you can do with your money - gambling is at one end, investment is at the other. Buying BTC is probably less risky than going to the casino and putting it all on black, but way more risky than buying a house or stocks. Given the crazy boom / bust cycle we have seen, the lack of a fundamental value (which would set a floor), and that the main reason most people buy crypto is that they hope it'll go up it's very much closer to the gambling end of the spectrum.
Going into debt to gamble is a very poor financial decision. Going in to debt to buy crypto is ... well, you decide.

You know that’s crazy right? “Never work again” style financial freedom you’re talking about $2M+ after taxes.

Literally everything you have said is wrong.


What about investment in Bitcoin Cash? No, not all investment is good.


Investing in mining equipment does not make price rise.
In fact investment in mining hardware may LOWER price. They spend money up front to buy mining hardware, which they need to recoup the costs of. That increases selling pressure, lowering price.


How? Difficulty going up affects price ... how?

No need to recall anything, you can read your comment in the parent post :)
My point is that BTC has not gone from $3k to $11k in a few months because people have suddenly starting viewing it as a "legitimate" investment.
If you take that argument, then the crash last year was people suddenly deciding it was an "illegitimate" investment.
BTC is a speculative investment. People will buy it when they think the price is going to go up, and sell it when they think the price is going to go down. It's really as simple as that.

 transaction volume is going down (see the chart I just posted), and there's only 5M wallets with more than 0.01 BTC in them ... this does not look good.
More importantly, there's no reason for your average American to adopt BTC. There's been plenty of advances in payments that have simply been ignored by the bulk of the US public, eg contactless payments (apple pay, etc) and these are clear, obvious improvements. BTC is not a clear improvement, so what exactly is going to drive the price up?
@_date: 2019-08-21 22:58:03
Let me caveat this with no one knows ... but the price jumped $1,000 on the news (kinda, [ so everyone who thinks it's going to be positive has bought in and driven the price up.
Now it has to live up to that expectation or the price will drop (assuming the market has priced the information in accurately). Is demand going to soar? Is bakkt really offering something that we don't have right now? We have CME futures and secure custody with Coinbase, the only difference is this is physically BTC settled. Is that what is holding institutional investors back? That doesn't sound right to me, but I have no insight into the institutional money space.

Warren is famous for investing based on fundamental analysis. He is very clear on this - he does not speculate.

Fools gold has significantly different properties to real gold, and is less scarce. Shitcoins can have identical properties to Bitcoin, and can be even more scarce. Each time Bitcoin gets forked (and surely you don't think Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash will be the last fork of Bitcoin) you've got near-identical coins diluting the perceived scarcity of Bitcoin.
Maybe Bitcoin will retain the mantle because it was the first mover and as adoption increases it will make the coin scarcity valuable. Maybe it won't ... it's hard to imagine a scenario where Bitcoin really takes off as a global currency, where the price would need to jump 10,000x, and then the 5 people who own 573,958 coins [1] end up with more wealth than the entire GDP united states [2].
As to your other points:

If that's what you believe then stockpile away ...
On the other hand I think almost everyone actively trading BTC knows about the halving and, if traders think they're all expecting a pump, then I think we'll see a tonne of shorts open up before the halving in anticipation of a sell off when the price doesn't change substantially.
We'll see.

But if everyone just buys and holds, it's not a currency, and adoption will stay where it is now (close to zero).

I like Coke. Some people like Pepsi. Other people drink home brand cola.
Do you think Coke would be the same price or vastly more expensive if none of the other substitutes existed?
Bitcoin may be Coke, but there's infinitely many other cola's out there if someone gets thirsty.
Shitcoins and alts dilute the price of Bitcoin, and will continue to do so. Scarcity alone does not imply value, especially if there's infinitely many functionally identical alternatives.
This is provable by looking at coinmarketcap.com ... some people prefer Coke, and believe it's the one true cola, but there's a dozen other coins with a 1B+ market cap. Every dollar spent on alts could have been buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin is only scarce if you care about the brand name.

No, not in any sense. Owning BTC does not provide you money for the duration that you hold the asset.
You may make money if you sell it for more than you bought it for - that is why it is a speculative asset.
Come on, this is basic financial literacy.
Does Linux have value? Of course it does ... what’s that got to do with the price of bread?

You ever been to a casino and sat next to someone telling you how they watched all the slot machines for three years and this one REALLY pays out? For them, that is research too, it doesn’t make it not gambling - every gambler thinks they have a system.
Here is a thought experiment: you start with an empty table and place a toothpick down in middle every minute. When does it become a “pile”?
A casino is definitely gambling, an index fund is definitely investing, BTC is in the middle somewhere and the rest is lexical - but there’s never been a market for something that is purely sentiment based - there is as good a chance of making money as losing money so I know what end I’d put it at.

It’s not faster transfer because you need to get your money in and out of an exchange first. Paypal had instant transfers 10 years ago - the slow part is getting your money on network.
Also, most countries have free realtime transfer systems now.
And how much cash do you need under your bed for a full year before inflation actually matters? How many people in those countries meet that criteria?

My guess at where we are mis-communicating is that you're not actually involved in the payment industry or an online merchant, so you're looking in from the outside and thinking that it solves a whole heap of problems when in reality it's much more complex.
\&gt; In short, modern payment methods are severely bottlenecked by fiat currency.
This sentence doesn't mean anything. Please explain.
\&gt; Pairing the tech of modern payment methods with the tech of bitcoin not only removes that bottleneck, it provides infinite scalability into the future, because both are software and not vulnerable to the limitations of fiat.
What fricken limitations do you think Bitcoin is removing? Do you know how much money is moved in the FX market, or by Visa and Mastercard every day? Can you name a single occasion you tried to do something at you got an error saying "sorry, can't do that, fiat limitations". So what limitations are you talking about?
I can transfer money instantly anywhere in my country (Australia), I can move it anywhere in the world instantly (Paypal or TransferWise), and I can get physical currency literally anywhere in the world because there's an incredible worldwide ATM network.
WHAT LIMITATIONS?
\&gt; More importantly it removes enormous expense of middlemen.
By enormous you mean between 0.5% and 2% I guess?
So let's look at a merchant: to start getting paid I need a bank with a merchant account and a payment gateway. The transaction goes:
\*\*Customer -&gt; VISA/MasterCard network -&gt; Bank Merchant Account -&gt; Me\*\*
And let's look at crypto:
\*\*Customer -&gt; BTC network -&gt; Exchange -&gt; Me\*\*
So you are replacing Visa/MasterCard with the BTC network, but you still need to go through an exchange to pay any suppliers ... so it's not really removing the quantity of middlemen (one day you won't need an exchange blah blah).
But this isn't really an apples to apples comparison. Customers like chargebacks, and it doesn't matter what merchants like. So if BTC does take off there's going to have to be a "trust" middleware added. This trust middleware will end up taking a small percentage transaction fee but guarantee a refund if the goods don't arrive etc. Then we're kinda back where we started, maybe it's fractionally cheaper than VISA, maybe it's not.
You're also not paying attention if you think Visa is competing on price. All their cash back, points, and sponsoring the goddam olympics proves that the surcharge is not price sensitive.
I guess I was really hoping that I'd learn something in this discussion ... but frankly it's just more "dumb optimism" from someone who isn't close enough to the technology or the problem it's meant to solve.

Okay so we have one:
*BTC* will be valuable to *consumers* because they will be able to *buy things anywhere in world without any conversion.*
That wasn't so hard was it?
Of course this one is pretty easy to pick apart ...
Right now consumers can do this with their credit / debit cards. Almost everyone has one, and VISA/MasterCard take care of the exchange instantly. If something goes wrong you can ask for your money back too!
In a perfect world everyone gets paid with BTC and no one has to convert - I get that - but to get to that point BTC has to win first. So until BTC wins, the process of paying looks like:
You need you register on an exchange, upload your passport and drivers license, take a photo of your face next to a piece of paper with your signature on it ... then you deposit your money and pay a hefty exchange fee, wait a few weeks for it to clear ... then you can buy something from the half dozen merchants in your country with BTC support, with no recourse if something goes wrong.
So if the existing technology is far easier, and cheaper to use than the replacement ... how do we get to the point where BTC wins? What are you basing the idea on that BTC will somehow overtake the current system? What can BTC do that other payment methods cannot?
Could you make the same argument about horses and cars? I don't think so ... there were always people that saw the advantages and could articulate them. Cars would eventually be faster, weather proof, not need acreages, be smoother ...
We already have instant online purchases from anywhere in the world ... how's BTC making that better? There just HAS to be a better answer than "you'll see".


Given the merchant adoption is still pretty close to 0.00% I think we missed our chance to reach takeoff velocity. Over the next 10 years people will continue to speculate, BTC will go up and down, but in the absence of any meaningful adoption people will eventually lose interest and it'll peter out and become a little niche synonymous to online gambling. People will come up with valuable uses of DLT but that won't help BTC.
There's plenty of examples from history of tech getting lots of investment but not quite taking off and eventually being replaced ... betamax, internet explorer, segways ...

“Poor” usually means they don’t have savings - like 78% of Americans living paycheque to paycheque [1].
“Poor people” are not fretting about losing purchasing power on the $1000 they have stashed away each year, they are worried about the minimum wage not being enough to buy food, cover medical bills and rent increases.
It takes a special type of ignorance to believe BTC is going to help people “poor people” with enough savings to have to worry about inflation.

False. Capital gains are taxed separately to your income tax, in most countries one does not affect the other.


To “live on gains” you would need to completely replace your income (say 80k USD) without eating into your principal substantially. If you had 5BTC you would need them to be worth north of say $300k before you start “living on the gains”.
So we would need a price increase of 10x in a year ($60k USD per coin) for this comment to be true.

In terms of float? What is that supposed to mean?
The BTC supply increases by roughly 1800 coins every day.
Both the BTC trading volume, and search volume for BTC is trending down when viewed over the last 24 months. The price is a quarter of its peak. These are all measures of demand, and they all say that demand is down.

The best analogy I have for what you're saying is that you're a guy with a slightly worse shovel trying to sell shovels to people that already have shovels, telling them about how great your shovel is in ways that no one really gives a shit about.
Bitcoin isn't better than fiat in lots of ways. Cash is more anonymous, methods of transferring cash are way easier to use (debit cards, credit cards, wepay, alipay, any country with realtime payments), cash is inherently stable in all developed countries, it's accepted everywhere, the supply is NOT limited which all economic wisdom suggests is much better for prosperity, and cash can handle more than 7 transactions per second (lol).
And while BTC provides the fundamentals of a payment network, that's not a useful distinction, because to make use of that I still need software to drive it. What's the difference to me accepting payments on my site via Stripe or Bitpay? I don't even understand what you mean with "accounting and maintenance", how is BTC useful to me for accounting? I would still need accounting software, it's just getting its bank feed from the blockchain instead of my bank ... big whoop.

Sigh. You seem to be saying that when new things come out it takes a while until they get adopted. That's true.
When the first car came out: it was slower, needed more maintenance, and you had to fill it up with something that wasn't grass on the side of the road.
I imagine you are applying that same analogy. BTC came out, it's technically superior, so eventually it must take over.
This is survivor bias. 
For every invention like the car that transformed the world, there were 100,000 inventions and applications of ideas that never went anywhere.
Can BTC transform the world? It's possible. Can we, 10 years in, start making educated guesses at what the probability of it succeeding is? Also yes ...
Back to the car ... after a few years, cars sure started to look like a decent alternative. They were more expensive, but they could also be parked in your driveway and not require acreage to feed and home. They still needed a visit by a mechanic fairly regularly, but you didn't need a live in stablehand. The benefits start to make themselves apparent. Once the benefits clearly outweigh the cost of switching, consumers jump on board.
However, back in BTC land, there's still no obvious benefit to consumers or businesses. Worse, no one can even imagine what that benefit might be ...
So, maybe BTC is going to change the world ... but probably not, because it's not improving at a rate where it's likely to overtake anything.

Search traffic is down however you look at it: [
The number of merchants accepting Bitcoin might as well be zero that number is so low. They are either corner stores doing MAX $5k/year in BTC or heavily invested in the space (like [overstock.com]( where crypto is a few percent of sales and the most popular item bought with BTC are t-shirts).
You say there's no adoption because the payment experience sucks ... we are 10 years in and we're not even close to catching up to where the market is at (AliPay, WePay, Apple Pay), why would ANYONE look at that and say success is a sure thing? In 5 years someone will be in here saying "look it's almost as good as apple pay this is it boys to the moon!'. No. Wrong. For customers to adopt it, it needs to be BETTER. We're further behind, and moving slower, doesn't that give you a pretty strong indication that it's not ever going to get there?
The world is getting smaller as you say - but you can travel anywhere in the world right now and use VISA/Mastercard without having to touch the local currency. For the end user what's my incentive to change?
Realistically I can't see how we'll ever have a global currency. As long as we have independent countries they will want to have control over their money supply. I don't see the USA or China ceasing to exist in our lifetimes, so I don't buy into that magical hand-wave argument.

Because it doesn’t solve a problem that consumers or merchants actually have.
Consumers can pay more easily by tapping their phone or their card.
Merchants can already accept payment from customers using something customers have (almost all have a credit or debit card, almost none have BTC).
Despite what diydude says (who has clearly never spoken to a merchant) the fees for most merchants are insignificant - if you are doing $30k/month you are paying like $300 bucks a month in merchant fees. That is not enough of a saving to motivate a merchant to try and change customer behaviour.

Are we talking about the same BTC, the one with double digit price swings on any given day, helping people measure whether their pay rises keep up with inflation between 2 and 4%?

You picked "cryptogrip" as your reddit username, so the evidence suggests otherwise, but okay.


Which party (person, business or government) wants every single transaction in the world recorded? I don’t want this as a consumer or a business, so who exactly would drive this? Surely you don't think a government would ever mandate Bitcoin as their national currency?
And if no one really wants this ... why do you think it's such a great feature? 


Can you give a few examples to demonstrate your point? Meeting consumer or business demand seems like exactly how you go mainstream, not meeting it seems exactly how you go out of business.

What? Are you really trying to say BTC is good for the environment? Running a miner on “green” energy in the USA you consume a tonne of energy and the reward is literally a few bucks per day.
And green energy doesn’t mean there is no environmental impact. If the green energy is fully consumed then the grid falls back on coal. It is a savage thing to do to the planet.

This logic is silly, because you can make the same argument about a pyramid scheme, or a pump and dump scheme.
“Everyone else before me got rich, I am sure it will work for me if I wait long enough”
I am not saying Bitcoin is either of these things, but we are at the wrong end of one of the largest speculative bubbles in history, something fairly dramatic has to happen for demand to increase like that ever again.

I think everyone realises that, it's in the news quite a bit. I don't think anyone is suggesting that Bitcoin  addresses systematic inequality.

@_date: 2018-11-12 10:17:18


Well not yet. If you want to do anything with your BTC you probably need to convert it to fiat via an exchange. That's less efficient. Do you have an appreciation of how much energy it takes to move a dollar on BTC vs VISA or SWIFT? Bitcoin is NOT an efficient payment network. It has other cool properties, but efficiency is not one of them.


Um what, that sounds like adding labour costs to me? Again, blockchain has some cool properties like trustlessness, but efficiency is not one of them.


What are you talking about? Companies need to do three things, buy stuff, sell stuff, and pay their employees. This all happens in fiat. What savings are you talking about?


Maybe. Interbank settlement (eg ripple) is actually a really cool application of DLT. Keep in mind SWIFT v3 achieves the same thing with a fraction of the energy usage.




It's about a decade too late. M-Pesa's pretty darn efficient and has a massive market share. Hard to see how Blockchain is going to make it more efficient.


Subverting government is not really an efficiency thing.


Example please?
There's a single example in there that really makes sense (interbank transfers). Everything else is just propaganda.

I'm not sure what part of my comment you're replying too ... my point is that we should not be revering "strong hands". Strong hands are damned near useless to Bitcoin because they don't actually use it, they just hodl. If we want mass adoption, stop celebrating accumulation by a tiny minority.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:31:31
Why do you cling to this stupid theory? Price is multi dimensional, the number of people googling Bitcoin does not directly correlate to price. It is but one factor in a host of other factors.
The fact you were completely wrong about the bottom before this crash after asserting the current price would be “mathematically impossible”, not to mention the fact that interest has gone UP while price has gone DOWN should give you something to think about before you post this crap again.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:19:01

It is hard to imagine a scenario where it rebounds. If you look at a tech adoption curve, the “early majority” segment were horribly burnt and lost most of their money. Why would they come back? Is there another segment of the market that can pump enough dollars to raise the price again?

What is the accumulated uncertainty and error on your model? eg. for each assumption you've made, what is the ± and how does that effect the end result? If you're a math nerd, this is stats 101.


Assumes growth in 2018 is going to match 2014-2016 which is a pretty huge assumption. Best case the error is ± 50%


Okay sure just drop data from the model if it doesn't fit ... let's be super nice and say this adds another ± 25%.


Okay so I guess we just make up a number here and say it's probably ± 200%
So now we take your number, $5,800, and we add in all the accumulated uncertainty and you'll end up with something like $5,800 ± a very large number.
This number tells you whether your model is worth anything. Coming out with $5800 with an uncertainty of  ± $5000 doesn't really tell you anything - which is exactly what you'll find when you do this properly. Big assumptions, selectively choosing the data, and guesstimating isn't make predictions - you're flipping a coin and pretending you're good at it.

You haven't actually addressed any of my points ... and ironically while criticising my anecdote you then go on to make your own.


Right, selling for more than you bought it for is literally how you make money trading.
If they sold it while the price was crashing to 20% of it's ATH and made "a LOT" of money, then they were lucky they made it out with their shirts on and good for them. They bought in extremely early and they held through a lot of uncertainty. Those people were the innovators / early minority cashing out - will they be back? That's literally my point.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:49:12
Can our planet afford either of these then? It is like Easter Island, we are such a dumb species :(
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:43:44
There was no escaping Bitcoin during the last rise. Again, we're talking about 3% of the entire US GDP. There were mainstream news articles every day in every western market. Anecdotally every second taxi I took, the driver was talking about Bitcoin and alts. Every time I got a haircut the whole salon was talking about crypto. Whole chunks of my friendship group that don't use their computers for more than Facebook were buying crypto.
If you look at the innovation adoption curve ([ then last years boom was the early majority, and they got burned badly.
Pretending that the "early majority" is infinite in size, or that there's a whole other "early majority" out there that didn't get burned goes well beyond naivety.

@_date: 2019-01-04 17:51:57
But they are not useful, because your model didn't predict a price crash of more than 50% ... maybe you want to say "hopefully these models are useful but I have no idea because there's no evidence yet".
There's more to Bitcoin price than people googling "bitcoin".

But $200B worth of bots trading with bots, is that valuable to society?

@_date: 2019-01-04 14:14:22

@_date: 2018-11-06 08:39:52
If you have any decent volume the fee for the merchant is a fraction of a percent with no fixed fee, and the money is in your account the next morning. Chargebacks are a pain, but do you know why merchants accept them? Because consumers feel safe -- they know if something goes wrong they can get their money back. And because they feel safe, they spend money.
Anyone excited about Bitcoin because it's good for merchants completely misunderstands how ecommerce works.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:10:15
Anyone who talks about strong hands misses the whole point.
Mining, the fundamental underpinning of bitcoin, was created to enable distribution. It was a mechanism to get bitcoin in as many hands as possible.
Centralising bitcoin into “strong hands” is bad for bitcoin, it makes adoption less likely, it makes the coin less likely to increase in value. No one will support system that makes a few people wealthier than small countries.
For bitcoin to work, everyone has to want it to work. The path to success is not shaking off the weak hands, but getting bitcoin into as many weak hands as possible.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:04:30
So then why are you calling it the best store of value on the planet?

Here's my prediction: there'll be a whole heap of new excuses when the model fails to predict the next big price change, followed by some adjustments to the model and a promise that it'll really work the next time.
It's the same story in economics: models are great at explaining the past retroactively, predicting the future - not so much.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:46:45
Timeline doesn't matter, but let's say 2018 just to keep it simple. If you look at the market volume for BTC, millions of people invested in Bitcoin at prices &gt; $3600. Only a relatively small number of people bought BTC sub $3600. Millions of people lost money, and a few early adopters got very rich.
Again, this is the point that I'm making, Crypto burned the "early majority" and they probably won't come back. Saying they'll be back because the "early adopters" got rich doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:40:33
Which post? All your posts have links to other posts, I'm not sure what your argument is.
Using google search index to approximate price suggests that the biggest market mover is your average Joe that googles "Bitcoin".

@_date: 2019-01-15 05:22:08
No, that's not at all what I mean.
I mean that Bitcoin had its moment in the sun and investors were burned to the tune of $700 BILLION DOLLARS (this is the total crypto market cap drop). That is 3% of the entire USA GDP.
There is now a SEVERE shortage of "people who are attracted to the crypto space as an investment opportunity", and in all likelihood, assuming most investors are rational humans, crypto may never recover from this.
To not believe this, you would have to believe that the majority of people who lost 80%+ of their investment would take the same risk again, or that there's whole other chunks of the population that saw everyone else get burned and still want to ride the rollercoaster of speculation again. These are long odds.

Isn’t this cargo cult thinking?
To be able to discuss this properly first look at the dictionary definition of money: money a currency adopted by a country. Bitcoin isn’t money, it is currency.
This is important because whether a currency is a wooden stick with a notch in it or a silver coin or a digital asset doesn’t matter, currency doesn’t “outperform” fuck all. Money outperforms, because it is backed by a country and the relative power of that country.
Arguing that the “hardness” of a currency is the defining property of how successful the currency is seems like you’re missing the point.
As an example the USD is the globally dominant “money”, but it is a crappy currency: relatively easy to forge (paper, unlike other countries in the G8) and hugely expanded money supply (recent QE).

As he said, all you need is one to invalidate your argument:

@_date: 2018-11-13 10:40:07


Let me get this straight. You, as a business owner, would go to your clients and tell them that you're no longer taking their legal tender. Instead you will tell them that they must convert their money to crypto (incurring \*massive\* risk of price swings, on unregulated exchanges, submitting a tonne of personal information for KYC compliance) so that you, as the SUPPLIER, can save less than 1% on transaction fees?
Are you fucking kidding me?
The other examples you've given are just spraying blockchain around like it's some magical sauce. You're not actually identifying any problems and explaining how DLT solves that problem.
Government inefficiency? Blockchain.
Supply chain centralisation? Blockchain.
Paying utilities? Blockchain.
There's actually a simple test to validate whether your examples are substantive or meaningless hyperbole. Replace "bitcoin" with any other tech buzzword over the last 20 years, eg "artificial intelligence" and see if the sentence still makes sense.
**Artificial intelligence**: It can cut off middle men, it can cut off labour costs for companies, it can cut off additional banking costs for companies, it can cut off labour costs for banks, it can stimulate entrepreneurship everywhere, especially in third world countries, it can bank the unbanked, it can lead to flow of money directly to the one who needs it, surpassing corrupt governments, it can cut off government costs, et cetera et cetera. The advantages are numerous and extreme.
Yep ... checks out.
Blockchain solves a very specific problem. It's not magic. There will be some really cool things that get built on Blockchain, but most of the problems you've listed could also be solved (and more efficiently) with a good old fashioned centralised database.

There is not added incentive to be more efficient, that has been the only incentive the whole time. There is no way to make Bitcoin greener, if they made rigs twice as efficient miners would buy 2x rigs.

How many people do you know who own gold? Like not a ring, a legit brick of gold stashed somewhere as a store of value?
This idea that “store of value” is some untapped market is fantasy.
You know what consumers use as a store of value? Houses. Because if it all goes to shit I can live in it. 
Or stocks, because you are owning a share of a revenue producing asset and you can easily diversify your risk across hundreds of companies or markets.
The major holders of gold are governments, and pigs’ll fly before a government decides to buy in and raise the price 10000x overnight - making a small minority sudden billionares. 
As for currency - no one will adopt a currency where most of the world starts at zero, and a few early adopters start with the net worth of a small country - not going to happen.

I mean what's the incentive to use Stellar, rather than SWIFT (which they are already using)? If SWIFT can do the same thing, and there's no technological reason they can't offer it at a similar price, that's going to be tough to dislodge them.
There's an interesting parallel with modern phones and cameras. The best camera is the one you have with you - the iPhone/Pixel/whatever camera has turned out to be good enough to gut the digital camera market - despite the digital camera being technically superior.
Will instant SWIFT payments turn out to be good enough, or will Stellar turn out to be disruptively amazing?

Why would you expect to see a guaranteed return?
If it was more than a 50% chance of it going up then a rational person would buy coins beforehand (which is what you've done) ... this pushes the price up beforehand, which decreases the probability that the price goes up slightly. Because everyone does this we reach equilibrium long before the event happens, which means it's a coin toss whether it goes up or down.
If you don't understand fundamental market dynamics then you shouldn't be trying to trade, just buy some as a long term investment and check back next year.

What's really causing the lack of adoption in the US though? Is it the lack of a good tech solution? Is Stellar solving some problem that has never been solved before and therefor will arrive in a fanfare of adoption, or is it some other blocker and Stellar will face the same problem?
How many people select a bank because it has cheap overseas transfers? Is the lack of adoption of something like SWIFT the market speaking?
There must be a sizeable market of people that send money home (to their family outside the USA), but maybe they bank with a bank that has many branches in that home country (making it cheap &amp; easy to send money home).

That's a pretty tall tail my friend. Not that I want to indulge you making things up on the internet (because who would do that), but let's do the maths on what this made up merchant is actually saving in transaction fees.
Typically a merchant will pay half a percent using Visa or Mastercard (usually they'll charge a 1&amp; fee on using a card so they actually make money on you using a card, but let's forget that). Average convenience stores do 3.5M in revenue each year (per [ That seems a bit high for Crystal Lake, Iowa, so let's assume a cool 2M in annual revenue.
Let's also assume that Iowa sports the highest population of bitcoin users in the word with 1 in 10 people paying using LN. At most this merchant has saved $2M x 10&amp; x 0.5&amp;  ... over a whole year: a whopping $1000.
Why would any merchant risk bitcoin's instability (LN still in beta, bitcoin down 15&amp; this month, 51&amp; the past six months) to save $1000?
We get it - you're excited about bitcoin and LN - but when you talk shit and spread stupid lies it makes the whole community look like ridiculous fanboys.

So then we all agree both USD and Bitcoin are currently inflationary (the supply of both is increasing).
The comparison I gave is to a small degree apples and oranges, but it’s hard to talk about purchasing power (the core concept of inflation) in any useful sense because there’s not a lot of evidence anyone is actually spending it (HODL yo).
You have to pick your timeline carefully when you say it has negative inflation - in the last 30 days bitcoin has lost 40% of its purchasing power (when traded to fiat). Most other timeframes you’re right - purchasing power (to buy other fiat) has increased - but this is by chance not design.

I'd check the math on that, you would either need to own very little BTC initially or buy a crap tonne of BTC at $3800 to bring your average down to $4200. eg. if you bought 1 BTC at $8k you'd need to have bought 10 BTC at $3800.

The BTC volume is very low, and USD is available and more importantly accepted everywhere in Venezuela. Most importantly USD hasn’t lost 85% of its purchasing power this year.
So my opinion is that while a few people are using BTC as a store of value, it is not really being used as a currency.

Once bit twice shy. There will be a lot of downward pressure from people that bought at $6-20k that didn’t get out during the crash that will want to get out if it hits $10k. Once you’ve lost your savings once, a good chunk of the population won’t be keen to make the same mistake again.

Re-read my comment as I don't think you understood it.
Specifically, if you cannot tell me any useful information about transactions on the bitcoin network, how is it "superior accounting"?

That's not a reply to my question.

His point about the futures market is a good one - if your cost of electricity is higher than the futures price, then it doesn't matter if you're funded with long term capital, it makes more sense to shut down and just buy the coins if you really believe it'll go up.

The jury is out, and BTC’s price is not correlated to the cost to mine a coin. We were for almost a year well over the price, and for months now have been well under the price.
In reality the jury was never in. This argument made no sense economically, I can spend $100 making something that only fetches $10 when I try and sell it. Miners need to sell their coins to cover investment in mining gear, buyers don’t care what the cost for the seller is.

America is as backward as it gets when it comes to paying, so adoption will likely happen somewhere else. The USA still signs for most credit purchases, Australia swapped to chip-and-pin like 10 years ago and contactless like 5 years ago.
