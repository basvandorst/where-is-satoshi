I would imagine it probably has something to do with delays on their transactions. outbound delays would be accounted for by the hot wallet/cold wallet explanation by Brian. inbound ones? not sure what would be causing that. Doesn't seem to be bitcoin related as transfers from the same wallet to circle showed up in minutes and cleared before the ones to coinbase even showed.
I suspect there may be code gremlins they are grappling with at the moment. probably not a big concern as it will be sorted, but still somewhat worrisome.

Has there been a sudden rush to remove assets from coinbase, requiring the top off, or was it a case of miscalculation that caused hot coins to be transferred to cold storage? Perhaps a combination of the 2? Suggesting you need to move coins from the cold wallets to the hot wallet, while it explains slowness perfectly, It is extremely similar to MtGox and I don't think it helps to calm public nerves as much as you think it will.

seeing as people were effectively spamming the blockchain at 1M blocks just to clog things up for days on end, do you really expect those same sort of people to sit by idle with 8M blocks and not try to fill them for shits and giggles? The "8M limit doesn't mean 8M blocks" argument is a poor choice at best.
As for the idea that somehow 2M limit would be just as hard or harder to go past if needed, it would at least have historical data for the effects on the network to look to. going above 1M so far has not been done by the main network and has minimal information to work on. You can simulate the futz out of it, but that doesn't take into account the actual network effect the limit change would have in the real world.
Find a smaller jump in size and put it through. Show everyone the world doesn't end and there isn't some unforeseen issue as a result of larger blocks. The go from there. Most of the opposition to larger blocks is not some conspiracy as many seem to think. It is coming from a position of lack of knowledge. nothing is going to provide the same argument for larger blocks better than doing it in a reasonable way and looking at the result.

Ok so my question is, how does this decentralize mining? As with all other manufacturers the chips/miners will be sold to anyone who can come up with the money to buy them. This includes already massive farms on other equipment. they will still buy in bulk many times greater than the rest of the people buying the hardware. Seems like BitFury has found a buzzword to cling to to make their story one of "us vs them" where they portray the good guys. The only issue here is that they are no different than other chip manufacturers and miner fabricators. Thier story as i see it seems to mirror KNC, Bitmain, and spondoolies. public sales of hardware to finance their own farm that can mine until paid for, then be sold as a cloud product for greater long term profit.
Please, someone tell me where i am missing something. i don't get the hype other than for new hardware that sounds to be leap and bounds ahead of previously available equipment.
@_date: 2015-12-17 06:08:06
ok, so they are stating they intend to sell lots of chips to whoever has money and that their advertising campaign behind it is "decentralize, decentralize, decentralize". Again how does selling a product in the same way as multiple other companies do/did some new form of worship worthy endeavor?

The comment suggests there were times when both sides did not respond in a timely manner. Based on the fact they want to public the communication thread, i suspect it might be a case of coinbase not looking as bad as the researcher in this instance. It could also just be a case of coinbase wanting to point out why this report went to shit and their actions that might have caused it. In either case, i don't think the way this is worded suggests a 42 day ignore by either party. Simply that 42 days had passed where there were delays that shouldn't have happened.

With the increase of the blocksize, there is a potential for the resource requirements of running a full node to increase beyond what home users can deal with in various places(and in this case he is a developer who travels and wouldn't be able to work with live data as a result). this is one argument behind not going to such a massively larger blocksize in one go. the counter to that argument for people who support the 20M size seems to be that you can just rent a virtual machine if your home PC/connection isn't up to the task. the problem is that the current virtual server market does not have a cheap and easy option that would also support running a full node for very long.
The point i am making is that you cannot in one instance brush away an argument with the idea of moving users to "cheap virtual machines" and then also brush away evidence that the cheap virtual machine offerings also don't cover the resources required.

no, but clearly even gavin is not expecting it to take 20 years either as he has a proposal to increase the block size yearly. you don't suggest an increase schedule like that unless you expect to be hitting a wall by that time. The argument of "well it won't be that big right away" is silly since clearly it is expected to fill right up within the first year.

Keep in mind the site is in Mbit and he keeps talking about Mbytes. the difference being 1MB/s is 10Mbit/s.  the site you listed shows the global average for upload being 10.7Mbit, right at about the speed he is talking about in his example.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:09:06


this goes both ways. seems to be 20MB or nothing at this point with no compromise anywhere in site. 20 times the current limit is absurdity in the near term and is looking far enough into the future that it really doesn't make sense to many. this is of course if you ignore the initial proposal for 20M that included yearly increases after that was implemented, suggesting the initial increase would somehow be insufficient almost immediately. i suppose that is really the only compromise thus far for the increase camp. the idea that 20M should be fine for years to come, but it still has high hopes for radical increase in network uptake that have yet to show any reality to them.

And what of the stats that show in the past year there is a steady decline of nodes, without such a change to the monitoring code? it only seems to be in the last month where it has leveled off and i'm fairly sure this won't hold forever. it is merely a result of the blocksize discussions. there may still be some statistics anomaly going on here since certain things do get blocked or ignored by bitnodes, but there is still an overall downtrend with the number of nodes.
I think there should be a more complete statistics available with filtering options. some sort of connection and statistic reporting method that would allow such a site to gather its stats without nodes needing to have an available open connection. regardless of the blocksize stuff, this sort of information would be useful.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:50:38
why would more space result in picky miners? they have more space and as such can cram more into a block. this results in greater returns for them. the only limiting factor to this would be the time for the larger blocks to propagate and not become stale. this is only incentive to keep blocks small if other miners are purposely making smaller faster blocks.

when watching youtube, how much of your upload speed is required? that is where there would be concerns with bitcoin and larger blocks. download outstrips download by large margins. you also have to consider in your youtube analogy, there are 2 participants in the transfer. you and youtube. in bitcoin, there are multiple nodes connected to each other. something more similar would be comparing it to torrents and considering both the download and upload required for such activity.

If that is the route bitcoin community plans to go, might as well change the name to gavin coin and let him do anything he wants as sole coder and gate keeper of the network. This shouldn't be a popularity contest. we are not looking for a new class treasurer for our highschool.

Personally i think increasing the blocksize is needed and useful. it is the matter of by how much that i think is the main item of contention. based on your reply i read into it(potentially incorrectly, so please forgive me if i read it wrong) that you expect a massive blocksize increase to create an environment where the market increases immediately and in proportion to that increase (essentially build it and they will come). in that sense it is a dream of bigger market, and by default, bigger pricing. this seems to be the biggest driving factor behind public opinion of massive increases right now. it is hope that drives the decision rather than an actual need. 
I think this has to be looked into by everyone on every side of the argument. What motivates your view on the issue? is it a technical need? a financial need? a moon wishlist? If not a technical need for now and near term, then it is a hope for the moon and doesn't have a very stable footing.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:25:35
I too find myself opposed to Luke, but at the same time i have been reading his posts on reddit of late and agreeing with them before actually reading the name of the poster. i find that a lot of the posts calling for support of gavin are all focused on 2 things. popularity of the person, or persons calling for the change, and the hope for this to be the next moon shot for bitcoin. there are very few points being brought up with rational thought that have backing information. we have at least 2 different extremes being argued back and forth with exaggeration being the primary fuel to both sides. the better move seems to be somewhere in the middle and i hope it is found sooner than later.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:41:53
The problem i see with a predetermined increase is that we don't yet know the effect of a single increase, let alone a timed interval of increases.
when the 1M blocksize cap was put in place, the wording of discussion about it seemed to suggest it would be used as a means of testing the result. we have yet to reach the end potential result of that testing and are putting in place plans to increase the cap with limited information. The only justifiable reason for a tiered increase overtime is the idea that the network will only get larger and need more room to grow, with no real numbers on the table for this speculative time table.
we need to either leave the blocksize as it is and see what the result  is of bumping against the hard limit, or do a reasonable increase (personally i think 2-6M should be the target, but 8M is not completely unreasonable) and see where the network goes. based on that we can then evaluate the results and determine if further increase is needed, and at what rate.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:01:05
keep in mind that the 20M fork is just the beginning. it is expected to be increased annually. anywhere from 30-50% / year after.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:57:43
but the counter proposals are all met with immediate outrage and name calling. somewhere between the 20M and 1M proposal clearly makes the most sense right now. increase the size, but be reasonable with the increase. then analyze the results. 20 times the current limit with eyes on future increases beyond that is silly with the current information we have. Especially when you see that the current limit was put in place due to a problem that is never addressed when talking about an increase.  it always seems to get met with "yeah, the small block size was put in place to prevent a spam issue. But we need more transactions to fight the evil visa!!!!NOW!!!!!!". really not much sense in the extremism on either side.

The abuse of the network that resulted in the 1M cap still is possible. it is more difficult but still possible. This is why the move to massively larger caps is worrying to some. the potential there for bad results exist, and although the common response is "blocks won't fill up right away", it is based entirely on expectations. i think this is why the smaller initial increase with a mechanism for future increases is looking more promising. it gives a chance to see how any sort of increase works on the network. the inital 1M size was a test essentially. it was something to prevent abuse of the network, and was used to try and see how the block fees would react in a limited max size. going bigger will tell us new things too.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:11:56
have not seen anything about gavin and 8M blocks. have seen posted his math was a bit off initially and 8M would fit his figures better, and i saw the community suggesting values from 2M to 12M instead. personally anything up to 8M would be fine. it gives a bit of info into how the network responds to such things before going forward to higher. really think a smaller jump is best since saying "those doom sayers have no basis for their claims" really holds no weight since we have nothing to base it on other than the scenario that presented before the 1M limit was put in effect. network is massively larger now compared to then and i think a more cautious approach is best for all involved.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:53:05
and what is the upload on each of those connections you listed? i have 100Mbit down but my upload is 20Mbit. obviously i would have little issue with hosting a full node at home, even with massive blocks, but that doesn't mean my connection is typical of the world. 
I also find it interesting how bitcoin is a global ledger, but lets focus only on certain parts of the world when we talk about other aspects of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:35:47
i think you have some good point and clearly have more than a passing familiarity with the block size increase and reasons for it. that said, i still think a large number of the most vocal people still expect 20M+ to be their ticket to the moon and unless they yell loudly enough, people will steal their money from them. the same can be said for some of the people who refuse any and all increase to the block size. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:28:17
After going to that link and reading through, i find it interesting that initially Gavin seemed to pick a soft limit out of nowhere as an experiment to test how many use defaults. Then Mike Hearn suggests larger and it goes into effect(although slightly lower than the math result Mike suggested). i this sort of a pattern we can expect for such things? gavin has an idea to raise a limit, Mike backs it but bigger and gavin says "ok, here we go" with no further discussion? Is there other places where this might have been discussed that makes the git conversation look different than reality?

Speed, somewhat. in some locations upload speeds are dismal. with larger blocks there is a chance of some people being taken out of running a full node(keep in mind, some people still use the core software as their primary wallet).
the larger concern is the amount of bandwidth over the corse of the month. many people calculating the usage of larger blocks are either looking at only the download capacity of well served portions of the US, or Europe and completely ignoring the upload required. They also ignore parallel connections and suggest that a single download or a small number of peers (less than 10, with maybe half of them sometimes needing data from you) in their total calculations.

@_date: 2014-01-11 07:14:39
Mostly due to the nature of p2pool. it is theoretically possible in the sense the code could be changed to allow control of the hashrate however since p2pool is distributed as a source readable format, this would very quickly be found.

I understand what people say the function is. 1 and 2 bullet points on that link make sense. It is bullet point 3 that i don't get. i run 2 machines that would be classified as full nodes since one is bitcoin-qt(now called core) and bitcoind with the full blockchain. With the validation of transactions and blocks it would require some sort of actual processing power in order to verify the data provided. at no time other than a new sync do i see either of my servers with any appreciable cpu load. That is where my questioning lies with the term "Full Node" someone like me running the default bitcoin software, with a full copy of the blockchain as well as allowing connections from outside nodes looking to sync and relay transactions, or would it only be someone such as a pool or massive solo miner with backing hashrate for their bitcoind that are considered full nodes? Like i said i'm fairly sure validation is only possible with some sort of backing hashrate since anytime i have run bitcoind or bitcoin core there is almost nothing in terms of cpu usage to report from either app.
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:16:24
it only makes sense in terms of pool rewards. every diff will result in the same number of coins unless the hashrate stays constant and the diff stays the same through multiple change periods. the diff is changed at a set interval (2016 blocks i believe). this is regardless of how quickly they are generated, or at what diff. The more hashrate will not change the amount of BTC awarded other than in proportion to another amount of hashrate.

How are people determining "Full node" status? From your posting it sounds like a "Full Node" is bitcoind running with miners solo mining(or pool nodes) directly attached to it. That being the case the only incentive for doing so is if a block is solved. otherwise it is simply wasted hashing power. This is also what the linked article suggests. Transactions are validated by miners hashrate, not by bitcoind itself.

What i don't understand, is why is everyone praising the dog who shit on the rug? When Gox Announced the cause of their issues everyone was quick to jump up and point out this is something that has been known since 2011. Since that time nothing has been done on the dev side of things to curb the effects of it. yet when they find that not only is gox effected, but a decent portion of the exchanges and other such payment tracking systems, they "jump right on it". This is not a quick turn around on this issue. This is a panic mode repair. 
to top that you have places like Kracken blasting all the other exchanges who have halted withdraws to protect their customers simply because they are arrogant. malleability allows transactions to be rewritten and caused to be delayed. this is true of any transaction and any exchange regardless of how they coded their system. it is indeed an issue with bitcoin as it is currently implemented and not an issue of how exchange internal code tracks transactions.

I suspect this may be something coming, but to quell current fears they found someone who could quickly perform an audit. As a result they chose someone who is well respected in the bitcoin community, as well as being someone who is well versed in security best practices. In the end its not as good as an in depth audit of coinbases systems but it is a good stopgap solution to tide people over until they can come up with something better and possibly more regularly scheduled.

I object to people taking an article like this as a means of advertising their rival service. it is a shady practice and immediately tells me they are not to be trusted. add to that his paid shill comment below and you can see clearly they are a subpar representative of any company. Think of it in similar terms of the BFL accounts that flooded bitcoin talk crying foul anytime someone had something negative to say. before that it is comparable to sock puppet accounts flogging new alt coins such as solidcoin by constantly trying to talk down about any other coin. I had a similar reaction to Litecoin people who thought the best idea to get their community support was to call bitcoin useless crapcoin that would need to be destroyed so they could take over. it is a bad practice and not something anyone serious would employ.

For many it is since it is fairly easy for online stores to add bitcoin support. For places like overstock and such, not so much. Cost of implementing bitcoins into their own payment systems and training employees on the new procedures are considerable. This is why online companies such as datacenters and hosting services accepting bitcoins rarely catches my attention. Tigerdirect and Overstock on the other hand raised my eyebrows.

Didn't he initially not "held his hands up, apologised, said it was a mistake and he'd fix it" and instead initially said something to the effect of, "I compiled it and it doesn't effect anything, if you want clean code compile from official source".
In reality, package maintainers should be doing direct ports from official released code if the project is to be named bitcoin or bitcoind. if however it is released as ljr-bitcoind or such and has a description of changes he has made to the code, that is completely different and completely acceptable. I also think this was exactly what he had done too once there was public outcry. he removed the blacklist from the bitcoind release and created a new package that designated itself as a modified bitcoind with the changes he initially had included.

They also posted to twitter about bitcoin and the response was poor. Many of the concerns would have been out of place a year ago, let alone today. I suspect bitcoin as a community needs to strive to better educate the public on practical use of bitcoin. Several people still thinking that if Green Man Gaming were to add btc it would be a risk for them due to BTC value fluctuation. I pointed out services such as coinbase and bitpay that convert at checkout to avoid such issues, but that's just one thing that i think more people need to be aware of.

The problem is you are comparing 2 different types of entities. A bank is for storing your money and doing things such as loans. An exchange is simply for converting your currency using trades. I have yet to give any information to a bitcoin exchange that wouldn't be required for a Fiat exchange. Really not sure what sort of shady exchanges you are using requiring a selfie, but i would run the other way if i were you.
EDIT: i would laso point out the information you are saying is too much is directly a result of using your fiat to purchase your bitcoins(or the other way around if you are selling). there are no such requirements for acquiring the bitcoins, or spending the bitcoins. bitcoin is neither broke or being nosy/intrusive. Traditional currency markets are the problem you have.

not really as you would still need to run multiple copies of the software. i think technically with setting different ports and forwarding them properly, you could have tons of nodes running behind a single public IP using NAT and each one would be considered a separate system just like if you used multiple IPs and multiple systems.

The hashrate behind GHash is massive. Telling people to move away however, really isn;t going to help ensure the GHash pool hashrate is not used for an attack of some sort. Most of GHash.io is the result of CEX.io. CEX.io has a fuckton of miners and could at any point turn that collective hardware against the network. If there is still a market for them to sell their hardware, or the hashrate that hardware supports, they will continue to sell it. If however they find that en mass people are dumping their hashrate and their product is no longer of any use, they might as well turn it against the network and make a quick buck before fucking off into nowhere. 
instead of constantly bitching about the hashrate and telling people to fuck off from CEX and GHash, how about someone puts up a competitive service? I'll sell off my hashrate at CEX and buy hashrate at any new service that is similar in its ease of use, and their pricing. Keep in mind there needs to be significant proof of it being a reputable exchange that isn't going to take deposits and run off within a short period of time like many have. Ideally i think it should be some of the asic manufacturers. Produce a warehouse full of the damn miners, put them online and sell the hashrate with a small maintenance fee. give the option to take the hashrate in delivery in the form of physical hardware. it is a fairly simple product and i'm surprised it hasn't cropped up from half a dozen different brands by now.

people keep stating that the reason for going with ghash is because people want a large pool with no variance, but they forget that a large portion of ghash is from cex.io purchased hashrate. last time this was a big issue on reddit, cex and ghash said they would implement the ability to redirect purchased hashrate to remote pools. this has yet to be done.

    You’ll find that user enumeration is possible on Facebook, Google, Dropbox, and nearly every other major internet site.
I would like to point out Coinbase is not any of these social media, or filesharing services. Your argument would make sense if perhaps bank of america, chase, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, E-Trade, or any number of other financial services were to allow the sort of information into the wild in the same manner Coinbase does. You may want to set your targets for who you are emulating a bit higher seeing as you do provide a financial service, not a social media experience.
    You’ll also find many leading payment services allow user enumeration, including Paypal, Venmo, Square Cash, and many others.
In the case of paypal, it seems to reveal an Associated Business name if the account is a business account, however i have not yet seen any emails that return the end users full name when simply requesting money. I cannot speak about the other services you listed since i've never heard of them, perhaps pointing again to coinbase going after low hanging fruit to support their claim.
    While not “unlimited”, it is intentional that Coinbase users are able to send invoices to an arbitrary number of email addresses.
Comparing to one of the sites you brought up in regards to being similarly capable of revealing user data, Paypal limits the user to around 6 requests before a captcha image is required to initiate more requests and unless i'm missing something, the API does not expose this request feature, and certainly does not return the end users information simply from a money request.
I really hope this gets the attention of someone at coinbase. I am a user of your services and while i don't seem to have my information plastered about the internet as a result of using your services, your approach to this issue is suggesting to me i should be looking into alternatives for your service. I'm probably one of the more level headed sort of users you have who don't jump to immediate hysterics and this should probably be a concern of yours if i have this reaction.

Solidcoin appeared to work fine until it turned out the master nodes were all controlled by the person who made the coin and he could manipulate the network at anytime he wanted. Add on top of that the fact he had a small collection of other people who would advertise the coin on bitcointalk and irc and such, claiming they had one of the few master nodes. only later they realized the private keys were given to them by the solidcoin author and he still had a copy....
Might want to look into some of the alt coin history before touting a feature like this to see the drawbacks to it.
On top of this i would also like to point out one of the biggest issues with early alt coins was the prevalence of premines. basically the person who made the coin would initially mine a crapload of blocks at very low difficulty. they would then get everyone else in on it and wait until the price jumped up, then dump all the early mined coins on the market at massive profit. Darkcoin while having no premine as those other coins had, it does seem there were massive flaws early on in it development that allowed massive amounts of coins to be mined. there has been atleast 3 changes to the calculation for block rewards as a result. This essentially has the same drawback as a premine. It might not be seen as one, but it works essentially the same.

See here is where this article does everyone involved a disservice. at no point does it get hard numbers on the amount or frequency. it simply takes what the user says as 100% fact and doesn't account for the personal bias the user has for their activity. This has been seen before in articles and posts online about banks closing accounts associated with bitcoin. many of those accounts actually had volumes in the thousands of dollars a week, but were reported by the terminated user as being "just a normal amount, nothing strange". unfortunately this article seems to be mostly a witch hunt pointing a finger at coinbase with little information to backup the claims. This with the fact it seems to be a random blog type website with no backing company, or any sort accountability for their content suggest there might be another reason this was posted(especially when mixed with some posts here pointing people to rival services). I'm not saying coinbase didn't pull a fast one here, but this article is just an accusation with little fact and vague accounts from the biased parties who think they have been wronged.

@_date: 2014-01-09 19:58:30
It does matter because cex,io hashrate cannot be pointed to another pool. it only mines at Ghash.io. Even if you sell your cex.io shares the hardware still mines at Ghash.io allowing that pool to maintain a large portion of the network hash rate. if you have owned hardware you are mining with, point to another pool. If you bought GH from CeX then your best bet is to sell it and then use the funds to purchase miners from cex, although this just adds more money to their coffers to expand their hardware. really this should have been a thought long before now.

I think something people are missing is the issues with delays as noted in this article are not a result of bitcoin, or coinbase, or any other option for coins available within the US. The issue is the banking system used for USD. The long delays in getting your bank account confirmed are present when linking different bank accounts also. linking my savings bank account to my primary checking account required small transactions to be made by the bank over the course of a few days. transferring money from my primary account to my savings takes a few days. 
My primary bank is fast to show pending transactions when i purchase things, but i know other people with different banks takes days for things to show up in their online transaction listing.
This is an issue of an old system being out of date and under performing in general. It is not an issue with the services built around bitcoin or bitcoin itself as both tend to be very quick when doing a bitcoin to bitcoin transaction. only when going from the banks to BTC services do the delays start to happen.

@_date: 2014-01-01 22:07:57
I don't see how you can argue that more blocks more frequently somehow makes litecoin superior. You still have massive pools generating a bulk of litecoin blocks in the same way you have massive bitcoin pools doing as such. Take a look at the size of the top 3 pools for LTC, wemine,coinotron, and givemecoins. Hash rates of these pools being 22GH/s, 14GH/s, and 12GH/s of a total network hash rate of approximately 90GH/s. You still have a significantly large portion of the overall hasrate for the LTC network in a very small portion of the pools. The reason you see more pools generally is because of LTC fanboyism more so than with bitcoin, not because of some sort of inherent benefit of the way litecoin works. As more and more large farms and asics come about for LTC you will see the bottom half of the pool list for LTC drop away as people see it more and more pointless to mine at these places.

That was my thinking as well. In fact most of the online wallets and exchanges and such that are replying to the mtgox notice seem to either be stating that the "issue" has been noted for a long time and that their systems are not vulnerable to the same issue as mtgox. Coinbase is one of the few that specifically mentions they made additional changes specifically for this issue as of now, but also did a review of previous transactions to ensure it had not happened previously.

1% seems a bit high for the overall amount of p2pool, especially as it scales. as it is with the 0.09% that is still about $300 / month i think. Seeing as he says mostly he needs to sit and think about where p2pool needs to go and how to solve certain problems, i don't see that as a problem. add to that the $3000 given to him by litecoin foundation, i would say for the 18 or so commits(some were just merges of other peoples trees) he did since then paid handsomely.
Really the best chance here is to either fork p2pool and have a team of devs on it, or come up with something new that does a similar task with a new dev team. It is rather odd that a bitcoin pool software dependent on the idea of a decentralized network is in the hands of a single person. he takes in work from others, but really it's less of a collaboration of ideas and code and more of 1 mans vision, and in the vision, the spoils go to the top dog.

6000 nodes run by random dsl, and other such users is far superior to 6000+ run by 4-5 companies also. this seems to be the concern for many people. the biggest argument against this seems to be "drive space is cheap so stop whining" but the number of current people hosting on virtual servers, or dedicated servers they use for other projects is rather large. these people will eventually have to drop off along with home dsl/cable people. if this happens quickly with no alternative node providers, the network becomes weak.
For me, i think increasing the blocksize makes some sense, but at the same time i don't think it needs to go to such an insanely higher value compared to where we are now. at least, not without some sort of tiered nodes and/or blockchain pruning mechanism that would allow node diversity to remain.

both mac and windows were based off previous software ideas from Xerox so hardly an apple invention.
Iphone and Android Phones/OS were based on the idea of a PDA + Phone. Microsoft already had windows CE(not to say they were first or alone, there were others) on PDA devices before the Iphone released in 2007.
The Ipad was based on an old idea. One that simply needed updating. As early as 1989 there was a touchscreen tablet that ran essentially MSDOS.

Any sort of backing evidence for this other than "This random user said they did nothing wrong, but coinbase is tracking their every move"?
In the one case i can see why they were flagged. Buying multiple btc in small amounts daily/weekly for sales on localbitcoins will look suspicious and that alone is reason enough for them to close the account.
In the case of the other one you have someone who said they were terminated for purchasing cannabis, with no indication that they transferred the coins to an outside wallet before buying the product. This again was someone doing regular purchase of coins, most likely in relation to their cannabis purchases, so linking the 2 activities is not really a surprise.
I realize there are a large number of bitcoiners who insist any and all tracking of their purchases is terrible, and that places like coinbase are somehow the devil, but lets not run away with an idea just because an article pops up with a claim like this.

Does anybody have direct statistics on the transaction fees for each block and how it correlates to block size?  i can see on blockchain.info that the overall transaction fee amount has raised since this time last year, but it doesn't seem to scale in the same way that the number of transactions has. the average number of transactions in a block has more than doubled since last year, but the fees barely added half again on top of what they were. this seems to suggest a decent bit of transactions with 0 or extremely low fees. this would inflate the issue much more drastically than it would seem at first glance of average block size by itself. it could even potentially be deliberate to provide the proof of urgency for the blocksize increase. i think this might be something worth looking into.
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:13:03
20MB blocks would mean we could see the blockchain grow by as much as 3GB per day (give or take a bit). This works out to nearly 90GB per month. This is easy enough for people with dedicated TB drives for their nodes and reasonable bandwidth but if you think the majority of the current full nodes would be able and willing to deal with such expansion of consumed resources, you are going to be shocked if this sort of usage becomes the norm.Obviously initially the usage won't be 100% of block max size to start out with, but even so it is a genuine concern.
I look forward to what Gavin has in plan in his blog posts to deal with such concerns, since the only thing i could see dealing with the storage issue would be aggressive pruning of the blockchain.

Don't think i'll take part in the outrage of others here, but i do think the response might have been a bit of bad taste. 
That said, although a few people not using their service anymore due to being upset at this might not be a huge deal to them. Perhaps customers of grubhub like me finding alternative services as a result of those that are upset might be of some interest. 
I order through grubhub every night i work. This is at least 3 nights a week, sometimes more and i have yet to have an order less than $35. Certainly larger orders(sometimes order for the office), but nothing smaller. i had never heard of foodler before. granted i have not done much looking around for these sort of services, but seeing it mentioned here made me check it out. Seems decent enough. will be looking into it more before using it, but probably will be using it to compare with grubhub in the short term.

I'm not sure how the 20Mb blocks is any better against your argument. the result of the transaction spam is the same. large increases in storage requirements that will displace full nodes and move more towards large organizations being the only ones able to maintain such nodes.

I'm interested in the results. mostly to see how easy it will be for 20MB blocks to be instantly filled with spam with minimal investment of time and money. one of the rally cries of people in support of the 20 fold increase is that "20M blocks won't be filled immediately". this test might show that someone could potentially make it so the new limit is immediately moot.

Keep in mind 20MB blocks, if full, results in 1TB of data / year according to someone else who replied to me elsewhere. a portion of people wanting to run a node hosted elsewhere are looking at virtual machines. while there are companies who offer vast storage space available, many have very limited bandwidth options matched with them, or their AUP that states what you can and cannot store on their services. currently this sort of clause generally targets MP3s, Porn images/movies, and illegal content as these account for a large portion of what customers wanting to spend $1-$20 / month on a virtual server want to store. This also tends to be the most demanding usage for these services, hence why the provider wants to prevent it. with that said, it is more difficult to find a place to host a bitcoin node without going to a considerably more expensive service, or fully dedicated, and in the future if it becomes an issue for certain providers, they will disallow it on their lower packages making it more of an issue for the general population to have the ability to run a node.

The thing is that what bitcoin.org is asking for is considered best practice for https sites. It is not something specific to bitcoin, nor does it effect bitcoin directly. it is something they should be supporting as part of their best practices security. To put it into perspective, i have a website with 0 users(it hasn't launched yet) that supports the feature that is being requested, and it has done for something like 6 months. It is not a hard thing to implement and really should be a non issue for circle to enable especially since they already support HSTS but with a short time period. Also seeing as both circle and coinbase use cloudflare for their sites, it is possible since circle has a short HSTS time and coinbase has a long HSTS time.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:48:52
This is a logical step. At this point they probably don't know how they were compromised and as such cannot create a new hot wallet with cold storage coins on existing systems. To prevent the newly transferred funds from also being compromised they are bringing new systems(or most likely newly reinstalled systems) online with known good code and with best possible security precautions and procedures. It would be considerably faster than an all out audit of their systems and allows them to get things working again while they do a full audit of their systems.

How often are you attempting to send a dime to your fellow persons? If you want to have a equivalent pricing to handling raw cash in bitcoin, then create a wallet with small value of coins you wish to send and then send the wallet to the person you wish to have 10 cents. boom, no transaction fee just like cash. Now to compare the fee of sending the 10 cents over the bitcoin network and "cash" try going to WU or something and see what the cost is to send the dime, hell try the USPS. report back and tell us how prohibitive the fees of bitcoin are again.

The problem comes from increasing too large too quickly. even coblee seemed to suggest that the current node numbers are low and massive increases in storage and bandwidth would probably result in a significant drop in full nodes. if there are not replacement nodes at the same rate of those that drop off you could start to see a domino effect on the network.
Add to that the problem of a decent portion of the community being outspoken about centralized features of bitcoin, and i just can't see it working smoothly if it is a sudden change without supporting features such as pruning.

The same way they feel safe with their money in traditional banks even though they have gone bankrupt, or get robbed. in the case of traditional banks they are fdic insured(should be something similar in EU). If Bitstamp can recover and have no issues paying out the massive demand we are about to see on their hot wallet, then this should boost trust more than it damages it. The reason MtGox was so damaging wasn't because they had issues with withdrawals, it was because they had the transparency of solid lead with no accountability. if Gox had been bought and someone funded the refunds, it would have ended being a punchline but at the same time it would have been a story of success.

@_date: 2015-05-10 16:58:47




how so? more audience for using bitcoin, or more merchants in no way correlates to nodes. most users are told to use a light wallet that connects to third party systems for blockchain history. most merchants connect to third party companies such as coinbase or bitpay for processing payments. In neither case does the number of nodes increase.
As for more miners, that simply creates larger pools. in the days of solo mining more miners = more full nodes but that is far from the truth today.
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:00:59
miners mine the blocks. If they have a choice between 2 implementations and they support one of them, that is the one that moves forward. IF you try to move forward with another implementation they don't support, you have a very small, very unprotected network.
that said, if all exchange points move off and the miners are stuck behind they have useless coins they can do fuck all with. The only way this cold war threat of mutual destruction works is if the miners blink first. You are far more likely to have the exchange points scammed before the miner blink. The problem there is by the time the miners do blink, the exchanges could be ruined.
in the end, it is complicated and in no way are the mining farms in a submissive role.

This is a simple overview of the potential of kicking the can down the road with a blunt instrument assault like just doubling the blocksize but it does characterize the argument against larger blocks in the short term.
To put some context on it, who are the large organizations likely to become the designators of large scale bitcoin nodes as you have described? Almost certainly organizations such as coinbase who have the money and resources to not only setup systems capable of datacenter scale full nodes, but also the capital resources to buy up large mining farms to ensure not only are they relay nodes, but also the block creators and transactional layers on top of the bitcoin network. That much control could, and would likely result in such an organization creating their own consensus rules once they had sufficiently controlled full node and miner aspects or had colluded with other such organizations to enact rule sets beneficial to themselves.
In much the same way I see Gavins actions since his involvement with XT client, I now view the actions of Brian Armstrong. I am suspicious of their motives and fearful for their future actions of success, whatever they might be.

To be air there were some delays. I know payouts from slush took a bit longer than normal. that said, I think the delay is partially due to the p2p nature of bitcoin and what peers are connected to what. Would be somewhat nice to get the network mapped in such a way that you could tell what is connected to where and if there may be some bottlenecks due to the way clients are configured by default to accept a small number of inbound connections and other small things such as improper port forwarding or strange filtering rules.

The fix is simply updating to the patched version. Not sure what fix you think is being ignored.
This also obviously doesn't fix the behavior that allowed this to happen. One of 2 things happened to cause this, and I'm not sure what would have worse implications.
1.) Code review is extensive but done by people who either don't understand the code that is being submitted, or don't understand the codebase they forked. 
2.) Code review did not occur and untested code is merged simply due to the person submitting such code having "dev team" status.
Both are disastrous and should be the focus of the BU community. Either you need more people reviewing code before it is put into play, or you need better controls to avoid certain members of the dev team from putting whatever they want in the production code. Possibly a bit of both. What is painfully clear is that you don't need to be running around claiming to be a victim of evil doers who attacked you and then denied your fix. It helps your cause least of all.

The period of time where the network difficulty is not changed. It is not adjusted daily, weekly, or on a per block basis. It is adjusted once every set number of blocks. How long that is, is entirely a result of how quickly blocks are generated. When i said cycle, i meant this:
Diff set -&gt; blocks mined -&gt;retarget block hit(2016 blocks since last diff) - Diff set...
It is a cycle.


Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. When the hashrate in the scenario i have presented drops off, that will not be every couple of weeks. As i said, check into the namecoin network before it was merge mined. This has happened as it would with a fork that would very suddenly drop the network hashrate, on either side of the fork.


In my example it is not a theoretical, it happened. The reasoning behind it was that difficulty of namecoin would drop to a point that if you switched to mine namecoin, you could mine enough that once exchanged to bitcoin, you made more than trying to directly mine bitcoin itself. The way it worked was that people would see they could mine namecoin and make more than mining bitcoin, switch networks and mine namecoin at a profit until the diff re targeted. Once the new difficulty took effect and people noticed they mined less on namecoin than if they mined bitcoin directly, they would switch. this left behind namecoin miners with a significantly higher difficulty and significantly lower network hashrate. they would slowly get through to the next retarget block where the diff would then be set much lower since it took so long to get to this new retarget block. This would draw back in the people who had gone back to bitcoin. This repeated for some time until namecoin was set to merge mine with bitcoin. This leveled the network speed so there was no benefit to hopping back and forth. 
Hopefully the more detailed explanation of the namecoin situation helps with understanding the potential issues with trying to fork without miners on the network.

I don't think WU would be unused if bitcoin were in major use by the general public. it would however likely become a service that used bitcoin for transactions.

basically hashrate "dropped" causing the higher diff to make blocks take longer. It might also be due to severe bad luck or the equaling out of rather good luck at another point in the previous blocks of the retarget period.

I think the BU community needs to ensure they go through their code base at this point and patch up to the latest core release. They can ignore any features they don't want to implement, but the bug fixes in shared code really need to be copied over.

I would also point out a decent portion of the debate with block size and things like SegWitness are revolved around the networking aspect of changing such things. Propagation times and how the network would react to them. He should have a unique perspective on such things that would be of some help in decision making.
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:01:01
Well they probably will, especially with the way they jump to "this is a core bug" defense once finding this. At a certain point though, if you plan to be taken seriously, you have to either maintain all your own code, or admit that fixes for the code base you forked exist outside your repo.

Timing of the drop might suggest downward pressure as a result of sudden sales of coins. The kind of coin reserves you could expect a large farm to be able to unleash at any time to hinder market prices to bend other miners with similar reserves to their will.

I think more along the lines of using the same base bitcoin protocol and consensus rules, with added local api and software on top of it such as lightning style networks.

Ok, was just curious if it had been a transaction directly out of circle to something other than your normal wallet. Sounds like it was. Usually the way I deal with thing in and out of places like coinbase and circle is to transfer it to my wallet, then from there send to final location. It just seems to be easier.
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:24:34
Your point seems to be if there is a fork, core becomes the smaller network and classic the larger one. Not sure how you plan to do that if the largest chunk of the mining power currently available supports core. Your thought experiment really doesn't make much sense compared to what i had said.
 If you want an idea of how abandoning miners might effect the network and the exchanges, consider how namecoin operated for some time. Miners were using hop strategy to mine for a short period at the start of a new block cycle. This would drive difficulty way up. they would then jump out and back to bitcoin as it was more profitable. They left a very small fraction of the miners behind who would progress the blocks till the next difficulty calculation. The difficulty would then drop way back down. The miners who abandoned namecoin rushed back getting to the next retarget very rapidly. They would stay until the diff went too high again and then abandon the network.
This is the same sort of action you would see by trying to force the miners onto a new fork they don't support. If you think it takes a long time for transactions to propagate with a day or 2 of transaction spam, i wonder how you feel if it takes weeks/months due to way too high of a diff and not enough miners to advance the block count. The only way to push forward with a fork that the miners do not support would be to also adjust other aspects of bitcoin such as setting difficulty to retarget sooner, and potentially to start lower. It would effectively become an altcoin.

I think you may be reading more into what I wrote than is there. I don't feel his conviction at 22 for his crimes amounts to a hill of beans for his trust worthyness in matters of today. That said, I don't think even Mr Ver would argue what he did was illegal. He makes no attempt to hide it, or put a spin on it. merely states what he did, and that he was charged and entered a guilty plea for it. Weather he  or you feel what he did should be illegal is a different thing entirely.

The rest of the story seems to be if you think what he did is wrong or not. Not in the sense of what he did doesn't mean he should be a felon, but more of a case of should the laws be changed to allow for his activity. As it sits now it is illegal and he agrees with the fact that what he did was illegal or he wouldn't have signed a plea agreement stating he was guilty.

Don't know how big the Switzerland branch is, but EY in general is flipping huge. Anytime you are mentioned as one of the "big four" in any industry or service, you are probably pretty massive. $29.6 Billion in revenue for 2016, and over 231k employees. EY is also responsible for helping the Australian government auction confiscated bitcoins, and they launched a blockchain challenge for startup funding in specific areas. I would say that EY is looking to bitcoin and other such tech in multiple areas and that this is not going to be the last we hear of them in the bitcoin news.

    Perhaps. But then again, you read into my post... 
Because you directed an attack right at me. You may have thought it subtle or something but lets be fair here, you stated your point rather boldy and loud.
    And how many laws have you violated today? Were your violations intentional or a mistake?
This is hardly subtext. Meanwhile the assumed thought from your side was that I was somehow attacking Ver by pointing the facts of his conviction. He wouldn't argue with them I would imagine.
    The point is that there's more to the story than "Convicted felon" that puts this into perspective and questions the OP's honesty and character.
Yes there is more to it, and I posted that more to it. The details of what he was charged with(as you requested) and why. He was charged with 3 offenses.
* Dealing explosives without a license (18 U.S. Code § 842 (a) (1))
* Storing explosives in a manner not conforming with regulations (18 U.S. Code § 842(j))
* Mailing injurious articles (18 U.S. Code § 1716)
You issued a request that someone post what he did in uncertain terms so you could argue with them. The response you got didn't have anything to argue with having had the "firecracker" defense explained away so you took to "but everyone does something illegal all the time" approach with a follow up directed personal attack.

It is a fair statement. I still feel like changing the units between mg and g for the 2 values wouldn't have really been as helpful. Besides that, I feel any effects of the 3000 mg vs 3 g values is mitigated by the 49 lbs of explosives (or explosive devices as I'm sure that added a decent amount to the final weight).

"Roger Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for selling explosives on the online auction site, eBay. " - Pulled from the first search result on google for "Roger Ver Conviction"
He sold agricultural explosive devices online while unlicensed to do so. He stored his inventory in a residential location, and used the postal system to distribute them.
Before anyone comes back with the "it was firecrackers", he had 49 pounds of them and they contained 1000 mg of explosive powder. The max size allowed for consumer grade firecrackers would be 50 mg. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 11:25:27
1000 mg was how it was listed in the article about the company who made the devices being told they had to cease sales. It also matches up with the units listed as the max for consumer sales.

as someone who has been questioning the massive jump proposals, my only criticism of this idea is the built in predefined time frames and sizes. In this case it seems to be predefined as a doubling, so it makes some sense.  
On the other hand, i would suggest 2MB now(by the end of the year) with a re-evaluation in 6 months to make a plan for the end of 2016. No predetermined value since we don't know the result of 2MB. it could have unforeseen issues, or it could work so amazingly well that going much larger might make sense with that information.
In any case, I'm glad to see the blocksize increase proposals getting more reasonable.  Nothing set way off into the future, or increase being outright denied, or massive increases into even more massive increases with no data to back it up. It will be interesting to see where we go from here.
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:44:58

Do you expect the spam to suddenly not have any effect in a larger block? It will still be an issue, but it will be a different issue. It will be a case of artificially larger blocks. This in turn counters the argument many have been making for some time about raising the blocksize doesn't immediately make them that size. In the case of persistent spam, it would.  Anyone running a full node not already prepared for a spike of activity 20 times larger than previously possible would be effected. hence why i have been suggesting a much more conservative increase. Mr szabo might also be being conservative mostly due to him having no data to work off of for a blocksize increase as we have never removed this limit before.

He doesn't live in a third world with cobbled together bailing wire and tape internet. His experience with his internet is just as valid as the experience of yours suggesting 100Mbit. I Fit closer to his experience than yours at a 5Mbit upload, but even still your argument is terrible as it seems to be "but my internet is great, you suck". Even looking at the US alone you are going to see a very wide range of speeds. The US is massive and as such makes it difficult to narrow down a general use case for what is a reasonable level of network connectivity to expect. Even the US Gov has a lower expectation of what the US has available. They list Broadband as a service with 25Mbit download, and 3Mbit upload. The Upload being the important part of that for full node use.
Now add in the rest of the world and you see that you really have no general high speed expectancy. If you only look at one or 2 examples, we might as well make blocks 500MB tomorrow because you can get 10Gbit connections in south Korea. Never mind your puny internet is only 100Mbit.

With as much "censorship" posts around here, it is rather hard to swallow the concept of an over reaching conspiracy to keep information out of this sub. sounds more like a small group of people posting outside of the rules or baiting the others to their cause by playing the victim. Has not been a day that goes by recently that hasn't had half a dozen posts i have run across stating their view on bitcoin XT, blockchain fork, and blocksize increases that didn't at some point try to curry favor with the viewers of the thread by claiming to be part of a censored majority being held down by "the man". I'm finding it harder and hard to take anyone serious who takes this means of parading around their ideals.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:22:05
It has been, but it generally gets struck down by the flurry of comments from people who insist the network is currently being held back by several hundred times what it should be right now. I think seeing the growth from a short term doubling (short term meaning increase by end of year, then wait a year to watch the result) would provide evidence of either a need to go to much larger blocks, or a need to go with much slower growth, but growth none the less.
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:57:42
I don't see there being more inherent danger in a hard fork vs excessive block growth for the sake of future proofing with limited data on such a move. there is danger in both, but either can be swept away as negligible by any number of arguments.  That said, i personally think taking a look 1 year after a doubling of blocksize makes sense. That is not to say it would be an increase at that time for sure, just that it would be looked at with historical information rather than expected or hopeful modeling. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:33:05
Looking at the pool locations and hashrate values won't tell you the story. many large mining actors are splitting their hashrate these days to sort of hide their size as well as increase their luck rewards. The story is better told in the construction pictures and videos as well as the sales numbers of mining hardware.

Thank you for your input on the matter. You seem to have a fairly level head on this matter and have come to the conclusion that there is no side to pick here as there are issues with the presented ones. I too find myself with similar situation with the presented options and personally find something more conservative in the 2-3MB range much more reasonable. Still not sure how it got to a point where you either leave it alone or increase the blocksize to 8 times its current value. It just seems like too much of a jump with limited justification.  I also find it hard to get behind the idea that the increase of such a size should also come with built in updates to a larger size (doubling in many proposals) within a predetermined time frame. I am actually a bit curious what your thoughts are on the idea of creating an increase schedule before even implementing the initial increase?

it doesn't in the sense that it takes the project needing work and throws it out while creating a new project with different contributors. Essentially tossing out bitcoin core and the devs who are focused on it and replacing it with BitcoinXT with a smaller number of contributors that allows for sweeping changes to be made with less review and argument. This i find to be the worse case scenario, and the biggest reason to not support XT. The changes to the blocksize are far from the biggest concern out of the XT fork.

I can't say that miners should have no vote in this since they are the ones doing the transaction table building, and initial relay of the blocks. they should have a say in the matter. The market will have its say via usage. if usage spikes and blocks are too small, fees rise and miners are then forced to increase to collect more fees. they can try and force out larger fees but it is counter productive at a certain point as you can cram in more transactions and reap the rewards that way while the network grows, or try and squeeze more out of the people sending coins and watch transactions stagnate while adoption stagnates. In this way they have both control, and are at the whim of the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:32:32
What percentage of mined blocks currently are these low fee transactions? Are only certain pools including these in a higher percentage?
My thought process on this is that spamming the mempool doesn't really do much as long as transactions are above that fee rate. But, if pools are specifically selecting these spam transactions in order to delay other items from the mempool, then you find the actual attack. If that isn't happening then you will see the higher mempool is simply a propaganda tool.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:50:07
It is also unlikely to be as big a challenge to increase the limit in the future. Much of the debate now stems from the fact we don't have a historical precedence for the large jump in blocksize to look to for information. this would not be the case after this BIP were implemented.

I just wish each generation of miner didn't ramp up efficiency and then decide to double overall device power usage. This thing uses about twice the power of the S5, and does 4 times the hashrate. If it did twice the hashrate at the same power, i would have bought one right away, even at this sort of inflated price. as it sits however, don't really have a place for it.

Yes, but miners will not go with something that will potentially result in wasted effort and lost profit. That means if there are no other nodes that will relay their larger blocks, they have done effectively nothing. there has to be a network of nodes for the miners to consider using something other than the bitcoin core specs. That said, the idea of launching a large number of classic nodes specifically to inflate node numbers as a means of instilling confidence that a switch can be done with no interruption to the miners.

Launching nodes of classic (or any other implementation) is not an attack. Launching an artificial number of nodes by a small portion of people just to enact a hard fork is however. especially when the idea is for launching a large number of nodes on cloud instances with the idea being to forget about geographic diversity as long as the fork gets pushed through. 
This is in essence the bitcoin equivalent of letting lobbyists determine policy.

He intended it as a means of holding off people who might maliciously create excessively large blocks. at the time, most full nodes were run by users directly as their wallet and were doing so on their home systems. If someone suddenly started making 1G blocks with misc data, or you had groups of people piling on data to form consistently large blocks, the bandwidth requirements  as well as storage requirements would snowball well past the point the network could sustain. 
The blocksize was set to a 1MB hard limit, with the soft limit being set much lower at the time. Eventually the soft limit was raised by pools and individual miners until the full hard limit was reached.

I had minerlink disabled on my miners. they did still connect back to minerlink regularly even with the feature 100% disabled. Not sure it was ever a problem, but certainly was something I wanted to stop so i managed to setup special dns servers just for my miners to get them to resolve all minerlink urls to 127.0.0.1.

Your blog post is taking an argument with a portion of the bitcoin community in the first sentence.
    One of the most talked about topics in 2016 when it comes to Bitcoin is the lack of a good plan for growing and scaling the system into the future.
Your introduction really does point to your point with this posting, it is not to provide information about current ability, or to provide factual numbers to the greater community.  What it does is suggests you don't think things are going the way you want them to, and you want to provide your argument to the world about what is wrong in your view, and why they too should see your perspective. If your goal was to simply provide information about the current abilities of bitcoin, then you opened your blog post with the wrong approach.
Reading through the blog post, and your responses here shows you certainly have a vision for how you think things should work, and are presenting arguments to support it. The fact it goes in line with the same argument that has already been had a number of time, is what is talking about when he says 
    Please don't drive another divide in our community. This issue has been resolved, don't open old wounds let them heal. 
As this is the same argument, against a small portion of the scaling issue that is directed at a change with many different issues working against it.

Your example is too broad. The BCH and Bitcoin story is more like taking debian, repackaging it with some tweaks and not calling it ubuntu. or if you want a more recent comparable distro(as ubuntu is much more different than debian at this stage), think ubuntu vs mate. Yeah they are strikingly similar but if the mate devs tried to call it "ubuntu too" and changed the logo color, canonical would have gone apeshit(and rightfully so). Especially if the mate people constantly tried to play themselves up as "the real ubuntu".

What i don't understand with this device is why people would want to hand over control of the bitcoin network to 21inc? These devices only work in 2 situations.
* 1.) Pools disolve and each device could theoretically mine blocks itself on a regular basis. (not possible at this stage of bitcoin)
* 2.) All devices mine to 21inc pool(s) and send back to the client a portion of the mined coins.
Obviously situation 1 is a idea of the past. It used to be possible for smaller device to directly mine but this won't be the case again anytime soon.   
Situation 2 essentially makes it so that 21inc has the largest pool, if their devices take off. In this case they are able to build the largest farm without paying for electricity since the person who bought the device takes on that cost. This can then be used to mine a large portion of blocks and take all transaction fees for themselves while splitting the reward with the device owners. as block reward dwindles this will be less and less split around along with more people with the devices causing a smaller payout for each device.
In the end you wind up with the largest possible farm setup with nearly no costs and a planned obsolescence. It will be touted as the greatest thing ever and as the PR finally starts to lose momentum, the company moves on to something else or folds outright leaving people holding the bag. This is the only benefit i have found to the device as it currently sits. All of the cases listed in the quotes above seem just as possible without the miner as part of the device.

Don't know i really care all that much to be honest. I keep hearing about censorship and how certain things are banned, but yet i know of all the things that are banned and the arguments behind them. You would think that wouldn't be the case since i only view information as posted here. The more i watch, the more i see Gavin and his followers playing the victim to push an agenda. The launching of XT and the media blitz popularizing it just hits me with a sour note. Adding to that the quote from 2011 about unilaterally deciding things and really i find less and less reason to trust Gavins decisions are purely for the greater good and not for his own reasons or personal gain.
in any case, it is politics. How the Blocksize patching goes will forever change how bitcoin works in the future. Not entirely as a result of code changes, but in terms of political wrangling done by different people to pull the masses to support their idea for purely ideological or ego driven reasons. Hopefully nothing terrible happens as a result.

It stems from the several attempts at breakout cryptos that have forked the bitcoin code, then went about pissing down on the heads of anyone who mentioned bitcoin. 
This ranged from people trying to get rich quick to people making a coin specifically to make fun of bitcoin. Each time it has varying success and each time it has left a stink that won't wash clean. So far the only coin i have put any faith in outside of Bitcoin is Litecoin, but even then the community behind the coin sometimes drive me mad with their call to overtake bitcoin. Silver to Bitcoin gold was the best thing i have ever heard as a means of advertising an altcoin but it is shunned today as though it were some big insult.

I was hosting a server for a friend and he had someone he knew taking care of some things on the website he had on the server. My friend asked me to take a look at why his website was so slow and it turned out his other friend had installed bitcoin on the server and was maxing out the cpu to mine his own bitcoins. I had no clue what bitcoin was, just that it was causing the virtual machine to max out cpu and cause the site to be slow. Killed bitcoin and told my friend to yell at the other guy. A few hours later i was running bitcoin myself on my own computers just to play with it. eventually decided it wasn't worth the effor since bitcoin was still really cheap (was sub $1 if i remember correctly). Made a backup of my wallet and wiped out all my bitcoin installs. 
A few weeks later i see a yahoo article about bitcoin hitting $30 each and i sort of panicked. Frantically went to find my wallet and setup bitcoin again. From there is was a mad dash to get registered on an exchange as the price started to plummet. Finally sold at $10 only to see the price jump back up again almost immediately after i sold. I made a reasonable amount of money. Just wish i had those bitcoins today. Would be worth a fuckton more now.
First transaction was 12/7/2010. My first block was mined later that week with 2 more a few minutes/hours later.

    We can increase the availability of the Bitcoin blockchain by publishing a well-established static prefix to a CDN.
Could this be teamed with an option to be set on the client so that full node users could setup their own cdn and advertise it to peers for initial sync? This would allow bitcoin to utilize cdn for initial sync, but still offer a decentralized option for source.

I think you might have hit the nail on the head with where the blocksize focus should be. near term 4-5 years out at the top end for now. Nothing too complicated (meaning not vote based or complicated calculation based). The only place i sort of diverge with your thought process is on the increase rate. 
Double from the onset seems to make sense. To me as 1MB to 2MB is a fairly big increase, especially seeing as how long we have gone with this limit in place. From there i think double is optimistic at best, especially without any information from the initial doubling.  
Really i would love to see 2MB limit put in place before mid 2016 (Jan-Feb probably get my vote, but potentially anytime before September would suffice). From there we can see where we go and have a set new limit by mid 2017. Sometime between mid 2017 and 2020 we can go for the final increase before revisiting a long term solution if something hasn't changed before then. That is not to say the time before then is wasted, I'm sure people will still be working it but clearly with less vitriol and personal attacks.

Sounds similar to Solid coin where initial network seed was to provide 1000+ coins to multiple different wallets held by trusted members of the solidcoin community. these wallets created "super nodes" that would authenticate and confirm blocks and transaction. The idea was that eventually the network would gain additional users with the required large number of coins to also be "super nodes" and as such, remove the centralization. the problem there was that because they were all in it for the money, they could(and did) collude and ran the network to benefit each other rather than the greater network. this is the problem with the idea of a PoS system where initial coins are distributed to specific members or foundations with the idea being to sometime in the future not have those people/organizations in control of the network.

Unless the distros and stand alone devices are using something other than core(currently i know of none that use something else for full node support out of the box) then your argument doesn't make much sense. This probably is what is contributing to your downvotes.

This is why in money laundering, there is generally a legitimate source of funds that is tied to the launderer so that clean money can mix with dirty money. The same should be happening with coin tumblers for them to be effective. teaming up with pools, online gambling sites, exchanges, faucets, and merchants would help ensure clean coins are always available to tumble with.

And the solution is to put trust in an even smaller number of people who decided to throw a fit and fork all while allowing a public hate campaign against anyone and everyone who didn't agree. 
I still don't see how anyone who is in favor of XT is using any sort of centralization claim as a reason for their support. XT in no way solves or even attempts to solve for there being a central effort for protocol decisions. It is just an attempt at a hostile takeover of the throne.

Personally have no need for coin tumbling. Like you the only reason i can find for such a service is to hide illegal activity. I suppose it could be advertised as a privacy thing for the type of legit services i listed, but i don't think it really makes sense for those type of companies to get involved with tumbling services that are mainly for hiding coins from the types of activities you suggested.

The reality is larger blocks would do exactly neither of these things. I keep seeing people put something about a rise in price with their large block proposals. It is a carrot being dangled in front of people to make them put little thought into the argument and simply chase the moon. It is counter productive as it seems to correlate blocksize with specific price returns. This makes it seem like the larger the block, the higher the price so might as well make blocks as large as possible so you can make the best return. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:11:52
I think it would be far better to have the blocksize work similar to diff. If x number of previous blocks were at the limit, increase blocksize y amount. if x number of previous blocks were below limit by z amount, lower y amount. it adds complexity but at the same time seems to limit spam issues a bit better than just increasing year over year by set amounts.

no but payment to them of a large enough size would take coins from multiple receive addresses and the transaction would link them all to that 1 purchase. It doesn't disclose all of your coins, but it would expose more information than i think most would expect.
@_date: 2015-11-28 12:05:48
well, we have yet to see anything from them regarding the decentralized pool. If they end up going ahead with it and put something out that can be used by anyone, on any device, and can be split into smaller sections(if it isn't split able you might as well solo mine, it ends up the same thing), then perhaps they will get less criticism. For now they have proprietary goals and only talked of decentralized pooling once they got the brunt of the community backlash for their released hardware. Time will still tell if this is them paying lip service to maintain a growing audience, one that currently is essentially bankrolling 21 inc who could be just pulling a KNC, or it might be magnificent execution of decentralized mining goals.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:49:52
Yeah but the limits seem to be tied to moon musings. We are not at 100% right now (yes i know, we are towards the upper end of the blocksize) but for some reason bip101 starts with increasing the size to 8 times what it currently is, and then again doubling that within 2 years. That is not conservative by any stretch of the imagination, unless it is clouded by some concept of the price being tied somehow to the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:44:27

I don't think i could correlate the rally with "XT has been convincingly beaten". I understand the stance against XT, but i don't think trying to pin the rise in price with an anti-XT sentiment makes much sense.
That said i do think some of the extreme fear mongering we have seen throughout the blocksize debate/talks has had somewhat of a negative effect. Clearly the sky is not falling at a round about 80% fill rate. i think 90-95% will be seen as a similar nonevent.
There does however need to be some well thought out plans with a reasonable execution time laid out. Preferably sooner rather than later. Personally i still think doubling the block size now(nowish really, within 6 months) is the best move. It sends a message that the idea of depending on 1MB blocksize for side chains and fee markets is not something that is expected or hoped for. I think that would quell a decent portion of complaints being hurled at the core devs direction.

Functionally i don't really see a difference. just seems like a way of distancing the XT name from the bad press of being petulant fork child that it is. Distance from mike and thrust gavin into the spotlight for it as some sort of calling beacon. The software is the same, and still managed by the same people as it has been. With gavin as lead, he has a fancy title. I'm going to add this to the list of things that XT has done that seem to be part of some spectacle meant to bring in a cult following not due to technical prowess, but more so due to political wrangling and shit throwing.

yet that is exactly what XT does. It trades one team for another made up of 2 people.

They would know those addresses are yours unless you are using some sort of web service. I think i may need to explain what i'm saying a bit more.
i have been mining for a while now. Generally i get payouts well below 1 BTC and at every new pool i switch to, i use a different payout address so i can keep track of where my coins come from. 
So lets say bitcoin address is simple 4 character numbers  for shits and giggles. i mine at pool 1 with address 1122 and i take in a total of 0.1 BTC before deciding to switch to pool 2 where i mine to address 3344 and i mine 0.5 btc before switching to pool 3. At pool 3 i use address 6689 and mine 0.4 btc. I now have all the payouts for those 3 addresses in my core wallet. it shows as a single 1 BTC value. I then purchase something online for 1 BTC and send the coins to the merchant from my wallet. these coins in that transaction will show as from 1122, 3344, and 6689 as the input addresses. This exposes those addresses to the merchant as a single source and they can then keep track of all transactions into and out of those addresses and tie that to that one purchaser.
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:27:56
You kind of have to expect that. The blockchain just grows and grows with no pruning. Both time and popularity increase storage requirements at a fairly high rate.

add to that the fact the ones who were selling coins were not doing so once or twice with friends or family. they were skirting around laws requiring them to register a company and have that company registered as a money transmitter.  for some reason committing a criminal act is fine as long as you are part of the same community...
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:29:48
unfortunately that is exactly what it is. PoS systems require you to start from a position of trust, usually of unknown parties. I might have slightly more trust in a system that starts with PoW and after some time of running(2/3 of total mined sounds like a good place to start), then switching to a PoS system. unfortunately you still end up with trust issues. With the PoW to PoS switch now you find that the system can then be bought through purchasing coin/shares outright, or by acquiring companies/organizations that already have a stake. That actually sounds considerably easier than trying to corner the mining market by building or buying miners.

If the miner is not the point of the device, and running the software without the miner isn't the point, what is the point? surely you can do the same thing as the $400 device by buying the pi and running the install script as listed above, and tieing their dev software to a wallet with purchased coins, or coins mined on something like p2pool with a third party mining software.

the status page is  as noted in the footer of the bitwage website. Must have changed at some point. Bitwage team should look into having this added as a rewrite in their webserver. It helps with people who have it bookmarked from an older site.
As for the twitter, you are right, it does say to hit up the bitwagesupport twitter handle, or go to bitwage.com/slack. My take away from that is that the twitter description has not been updated since the website redesign as bitwage.com/slack  doesn't exist.  does however. This is another rewrite the bitwage webserver team should consider implementing.
