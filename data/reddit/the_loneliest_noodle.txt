57.3% of reddit traffic is US.

And yet, you countered with another estimate and still think you're right and calling people idiots for providing data saying you may not be.

I was just replying to that comment. It may be dumb to say "but it doesn't make sense because it's morning!", but it's not wrong to assume if you're talking to someone on reddit, odds are higher they're Americans, on an US run website, so getting offended by it also seems silly to me.

Pageviews is 61%, users is 57.3%
Also, I didn't call you butthurt, I called you a cunt because you're the type of person who unprovoked calls other people idiots and make sweeping comments about "Americans", aka, a cunt.

Alexa was the first link I found that seemed trustworthy. Though the numbers do vary pretty widely between about 40% up to about 60%. Even on the low side, that's a huge majority when you consider the next highest ranking is the UK at less than 10%.

And there it is, now I can call you butthurt (and projecting).
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:09:49
still projecting?

All of them are estimates, and I point out the number varies almost immediately below. And no need to be a cunt about it, then again, you are the kind of person who seems to be offended by the fact redditors tend to be American, so...
