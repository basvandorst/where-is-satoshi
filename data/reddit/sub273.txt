From the picture, the fact it’s in Brighton, and on their website they accept BTC payment, I assume it’s these guys

Sensible stewarding.  
As an away fan visiting WHL with a 6 year old boy, I remember them allowing me to take an unopened bottle of water in.
The steward said that he was meant to confiscate it but they’d only charge me £3 for another bottle inside.
I so hope it was this bloke!

And at no point did I say that Bitcoin being doomed to fail was my opinion.  It’s just my evaluation of the risks.
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:46:27
Is correct.

Is this a sub for encouraging gambling addiction?

No, that’s where you are wrong, I don’t think bitcoin is doomed to fail, but I used the word “likelihood” as I’m a realist.
There are huge and multiple challenges ahead before bitcoin can become a reserve currency, even more for it to be a useful medium of exchange.
The Bitcoin bet may come off, but that’s still what it is, a bet on none of these hurdles bringing it down.
I get the arguments for, I really do, but that doesn’t make them bulletproof.
Right now there’s a long, long way to go, so anybody recklessly weighted to bitcoin, let alone crypto in general as per the OP is hugely exposed.

I think you are massively overestimating the number of people who have researched what they are buying and have formulated an opinion after evaluating both the long term economic and/or cryptographic reasons.
The vast majority of people who have bought crypto are in it for quick speculative gains.  Let’s not pretend otherwise.   You won’t find many newbies buying in to Bitcoin even after the recent  rise which is ridiculous by the standards of other asset classes.
If Bitcoin does go parabolic again (and let’s be clear here, there is absolutely no guarantee of that), then you’ll see the uninformed return en masse.
At that point, you’ll probably be rich and I’ll be the first to say “well played sir/madam”.

Got it.

Meh, syntax.  Massively overrated stuff ��
@_date: 2019-08-13 07:34:29
Point taken.  Skin in the game is one thing, disproportionate and reckless evaluation of the risks related to the game is something else.
Memes like this do little to appreciate the relatively high likelihood that Bitcoin, let alone all others crypto will ultimately fail.
I think we’ll have a much better picture by the end of the coming recession.  If money runs to gold and BTC holders bail to offset losses elsewhere, it’s pretty much game over seeing as it’s adoption as a widespread medium of exchange is just an increasingly unlikely pipe dream.
Strap in and buckle up, I’m sure it’ll be a ride either way!

Uh the fact there was an 80% drop suggests plenty did sell and there were few buyers for it.  That happened during an economic boom.  Now place that scenario in a recession.  Think this through, man.
@_date: 2019-08-13 08:30:54
It’s possible though I don’t think probable as it was such a tiny part of the market.  It was likely due to a massive overextension in bubble-like conditions which this market is prone to demonstrating.
Folk want in on the massive rise and out on the massive fall. 
Relatively few people buy in or bail out because of fundamentals.

“i guess its all just luck” is the correct answer!

Well my mate sold a small amount earlier to “take profits”, so there’s literally at least one other reason right there.

Reader here, I can't comment.

Though I appreciate where you are coming from re: speculation and price, to say people with no knowledge of crypto won't pay $100 is equally as invalid as saying someone with no awareness of say Tesla, would refuse to pay $10,000 for one of their cars so why would they pay $100,000?  A lack of understanding doesn't validate the opinion, rather the opposite I would have thought, no?
