The only thing I consistently do is Lose
Same as in poker. I can't make pocket aces come up. I can't flop a set. I can't convince the dumb tourists to bluff all in into my set. 
Winning is out of my power, out of my hands
All I can do is fold fold fold and lose consistently until the opportunity comes along.

nah dude the only way for a gambler to become a trader is to blow up
only then do we learn how to lose properly, and only then do we consistently win
the only way to learn is the hard way, then its branded into your skull and you're finally wise

Anyone with a brain knows an application like Silk Road combined with cryptos, especially the fully anonymous ones, are just a step away from an online marketplace for nuclear weapons, sanction evasion, fentanyl
All things Trump dislikes
