Yes, congress disbands and manipulates corporations all the time through legislation. A corporation is a total legal fiction. Corporatism can only exist through the state in the first place. 
Corporations are truly equivalent to the state in every sense. The protection from liability that a corporate person provides can only be provided by the state. 
So in summary, Corporations are the Government and the Corporations can easily become the Government. They are two sides of the same card. It is the monopoly on force that the state possesses that fuels the entire machine. The self-interest is just the human factor; you can't change it. All people desire power. You can only accommodate it to meet rational ends: Corporate personhood is not the way to do it.

Not bullshit.
The whole organization is a corrupt parasite against the people. They don't play by the rules nor the numbers they forge. 
The fact is The Fed is a proven fraud. Under that premise and the unilateral power they have over our money supply, they can do whatever they damn please. 
The CIA, FBI and everybody else isn't allowed into their buildings for a reason. It's as Federal as Federal Express private mail. 
Wake up. You guys are fooling yourselves if you think this organization is your friend. It's remarkable you haven't realized they've turned Congress against the people.

No, only 20% does. The rest goes to private shareholders across the globe. 
In addition, the last president that tried to disband it (Kennedy) was assassinated. Go figure.
Andrew Jackson, who ended one of the Fed's predecessors, was nearly assassinated. 
It's a very powerful organization to say the least.
