True that, analysing naked graphs, reading momentum, having some patience is the best that which can be done while being safe.

Sorry babe you may get sell if someone pays you to fuck your dad ain't the case with me, and I'm one of them who have made money off Bitcoin over the years so I would prefer the other way around, paying you to make porn with Dad or mumma!

If we're serious on the term Mainstream, IMO it hasn't actually reached mainstream yet! Bakkt and Institutions are still Awaited!

If you haven't yet, then don't risk to sell. If you haven't repurchased yet then don't risk that as well
\*not a financial advice.

Agree! People are buying for the money, not for the tech. Many don't understand the concept!

True that, technical analysis always fails in case of bears. And it's all over bear whether Dow, Crude, Crypto or other finance.
Moreover, especially i believe in cryptos that's the way to mass adoption, i think 40-50% of current btc buyers has purchased in last one year because of the Hype. Now it's almost  -85% mature ones are ready to buy same in the pasts when it was $2 from $35, a 94% correction. Totally Agree, matures ones are being saturated while new ones always keep coming.
Stability is that what drives crypto crazy, media is now saying bitcoin isn't boring :P
On that note, i would say  will not be used as currency in future it will be more of a store of value or assest, fast protocols are coming,    whosoever can replace visa or master, i also see Bitcoin's use as the most suitable trading pair for crypto as time flies people will be habitual of trading in Sats.

It's hard to accumulate 1M BTC if we go outside whether we switch to OTC, big players are in accumulation and if I'm not wrong we won't still be having 1M BTC available to buy if in case whales know they are being traded to a single guy.
