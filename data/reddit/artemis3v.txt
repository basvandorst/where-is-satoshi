It is currently illegal. Meaning: you go to the black market and get outrageous prices (and risk getting fake bills). That's what happens when a country foolishly pegs its currency to some arbitrary amount for a foreign currency, then fails to satisfy the demand at this arbitrary price, thus opening the floodgates of corruption (after all, only a select few do get the foreign currency super cheap, and proceed to resell it at black market price). Dolartoday.com is the defacto site for the black market price.

Some people are naive to believe the web ui is good enough, it isn't. Bitmain products web password is separate to the ssh password, which is often neglected by lazy/uninformed miners. If you just change your password for your Antminer using the web interface, you can still ssh to it using the very dangerous default... So ssh to it and change the password NOW (type: passwd in the cli).

Back in the 50ies, Venezuela was very wealthy, and there was a policy to favor immigration from European post-war stricken countries. Many people came and established their families over decades, but with the current situation those who can are returning back to their home countries, and their descendants try to get the citizenship from their fathers etc. Unfortunately some countries (Ie. Italy) make it nearly impossible to obtain it, even tho its technically their right. The Italian consulate only checks 4 people per week, so 16 per month 192 per year, in a country with hundreds of thousands of people with Italian ascendancy. You could easily win the lottery faster than getting the damn appointment, oh and there is a corruption ring related to it as well... of 30 million its guesstimated about 3 million have left the country, and only around 10% do so legally, due to many obstacles both in Venezuela and the country of destination to legalize their stay (ie. obtaining a working visa/permit, etc).

IMF is estimating this year inflation for Venezuela will reach 13000%. The problem is the government stubbornly fixating prices of everything, and forbidding free market, adding more fuel to the fire: causing shortages, encouraging the black market (because its illegal to sell above the decreed prices, but nobody sells at the delusional prices they set) and rampant corruption (officials need to eat, after all...).

While BTC halved against USD, VEF added a zero or so... In December (BTC at nearly 20k USD) it was like 1 billion VEF per bitcoin, but currently (BTC at nearly 10k USD) is nearing 3 billion (check localbitcoins.com). Venezuela is under hyperinflation, induced by a "real socialism" economy policy, eastern soviet block style... Bitcoin and most alts are far more solid at this point, even imaginary game currency (ie. WoW gold) is far more valuable.

Electrum 3.x onwards can make bech32 (bc1) addresses, but so far only Electrum 3.x onwards can send to these. You can send to anything from it tho. When everyone else supports sending to bech32 addresses, there should be no reason to use legacy or "3x" anymore. Catch 22 anyone?

Cryptos often behave like the price of metals, they go up when the economy goes bad. (People get rid of their stocks/bonds/forex and hide in metals/crypto). But they are not identical, you have to be aware of news in the crypto world affecting their price from time to time.

Because some people don't have any means of accepting electronic payment of any kind. Among other scarcities, physical money is one of them. About 90% of the ATMs are empty, so when one gets refilled, a long line forms and only the fewer lucky in the front can get some, just like everything else under socialism. Also thanks to the magic of Hyperinflation, a monthly wage for a full time job is about 5 USD.

Transaction fees have gotten out of hand. Why have we not implemented Lightning Network transactions in all wallets already? Why are the major sites like Localbitcoins or Bitpay still using non Segwit addresses? Can you afford 33% for 5 block confirmation, or 10% for a 25 block confirmation? And thats with you manipulating the fees in your wallet software...

LocalBitcoins is also shown as green, but if you try to transfer funds to it, it presents you a typical 1xxxx address.

We use LocalBitcoins to turn it back into fiat for daily needs, as little as possible since any fiat you don't spend today, has half purchasing power tomorrow.

Yes it is too late. PCs are useless for this unless you are into trading. You need to spend over 2k in USD for a very noisy industrial (but small) computer that needs a lot of power as well just to mine a few USD a day.
If you just buy and hold it might earn you more in the long run.

In modern hyperinflation the "paper money" becomes very scarce, so much that there are two different exchange prices for paper money vs electronic money. Before September, it was guesstimated that only 1% of the total fiat existed in paper form. Modern hyperinflation does not even bother with "printing", they simply add zeroes electronically at the central bank... When you have people willing to pay more for money in paper form, it immediately becomes scarce.

Some people do (especially the few that get the gov subsidized food boxes), but the most used payment method is electronic debit card (which uses small pad terminals that need dialup or mobile connectivity) and more recently some sort of sms code exchange that banks accept as transfer.

Unfortunately to become "the most secure os" you need to be open source, so that third parties all over the world can audit your code and certify that, yes, yours is "the most secure". Anyone in the cryptography world knows that your algo must be published to withstand peer review, or is useless. Same here... There is no security in obscurity.

Bitcoin is easy because the gov can't stop the transactions. Send USD (or food or medicine) and it gets seized at the borders, and in every single "checkpoint" both the police and the military decide to deploy at random whose only real purpose is precisely to rob money. This is a country where the humanitarian aid needs to be literally smuggled in...

Localbitcoins. People may not obtain gov distributed dollars anymore, that older system was completely dismantled around the time Maduro came to power. There is a gov controlled "auction" where very little is "assigned" to private participants, serving around 2% of the national demand.
Internet is garbage but not zero, coverage is limited mostly to main cities, around 40% with frequent (long) interruptions; which is why Bitcoin or any other crypto has not really taken off (I'm hoping BIP 174 improves this situation).
With an annual inflation nearing a million percent, the purchasing power of the bolivar is insignificant. Unless the person has some sort of income in (ANY) foreign currency, they simply can't live. We are talking about living a month with the equivalent of 5 USD, and probably 1 USD by December, just like it was two months ago before they changed the currency and slashed 5 zeroes from it while "increasing" the min wages etc.
The government absolute disdain and inability to deal with the economy is what is ending it all. Add rampant corruption and crime to the mix and you get an idea what this country currently is like.

The bolivar (VEB) was 4.3 VEB per USD in 1983. In 2008 it was replaced by the VEF, at a rate of 1000 VEB per VEF, back then it was around 5 VEF per USD. In 2018 the VEF was replaced by the VES, at a rate of 100000 VEF per VES. Right now the gov says 67 VES is one USD, and the "parallel" (free/black) market where the 90% of the USD are obtained from, says around 300 VES is 1 USD (it was 100 VES a month ago).
So 300 VES = 30000000 VEF = 30000000000 VES = 1 USD in 2018...
Even non blockchain based imaginary (infinite supply) money from games have stronger value than the bolivar.

True, but unfortunately "critical mass" is far from being achieved. People don't get paid and pay in Bitcoin, there is always the need to exchange into fiat for 99% of transactions.

A new currency does nothing if you keep socialist economy policies in place. That is: "central planned (command) economy", meaning: prices are fixed, earnings are fixed, the exchange of foreign currencies are fixed, etc. And the giant corruption this promotes...

3000000000 are $7500 at true (black) market price (400k).
There is an artificial gov price (50k?) that almost nobody can get to, and those select few who do, immediately sell it back at the black market price... profit!
