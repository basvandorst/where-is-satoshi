Suppose I'm in a pool with a 1 GH/s miner, the rest of the pool has 99 GH/s, and there's 100 GH/s other miners. So the pool gets (1+99)/(100 + 200) = 1/2 of the block rewards and I get 1/(1+99) = 1/100 of that, for a total of 1/200.
Now suppose that someone brings 800 GH/s into the pool. The pool now gets (1+99+800)/(1+99+800+100) = 9/10 of the block reward, but I only get 1/(1+99+800) = 1/900 of that, for a total of 1/1000 of the block reward. More people entering the pool makes me worse off.
Finally, suppose someone brings 800 GH/s into something outside the pool. The pool gets (1+99)/(1+99+800+100) = 1/10 of the reward, but I get 1/(1+99) = 1/00 of that, so 1/1000 of the block reward. Same as if they were mining on the pool.
The important thing here is that my average reward is the same as if I wasn't pool mining (aside from fees), but my payout is much more consistent. Pooled mining reduces variance.

First result for 'buy music for bitcoin' leads me to [this page]( I'm not buying it to test, but it says to send an e-mail if the payment doesn't complete 'within one minute', which implies that they're not waiting for confirmations. [This site]( lists a delivery time of '1-2min'. Also, I'm pretty sure Bitpay accepts 0 confirmations.
If you have a shipping address then you can (theoretically) report them to the police, sure. But if you're shipping something, it's not going to take any shorter than a day anyway so you can just wait for the confirmation.
But really, forcing users to wait 10 minutes on average for the electronic thing they just bought is going to produce a pretty terrible user experience. They're told that Bitcoin is new and awesome and shiny... and it takes longer to buy things with than with a CC?

You can't just ask each node 'hey, do you have Epic Fail Compilation vol. 24', because that'll take ages.


I don't understand what you mean by 'giant lists of user-patterns'. If I pick any youtube video and search for its title, I'll get it, even if that video is something nobody's ever searched for before.

Hard in the same sense that it'd be hard for you to drink the ocean through a straw, yes. You can make one-way functions that are (assumedly) impossible to invert given the physical constraints of this universe, but that doesn't mean that they're impossible to invert in the mathematical sense.


Well, if one-way functions don't exist then it turns out basically all of modern cryptography doesn't work, so your existing system for holding your money breaks as well. When I say 'everybody thinks they do' I mean that basically all of modern cryptographical research is predicated on that assumption, because without it it turns out there's not really much you can do. If you want 100% proven secure public-key cryptography then go prove P != NP.

Well, if blind people are supposed to use the CLI, and the CLI isn't usable... I went to go look something up but now `bitcoind help` is just giving me `error: couldn't connect to server` even though I'm running bitcoind in another window. I had to restart it 3-4 times, and I have no clue why it's only working now. 


If none of the major wallets are accessible and usable, that's bad. (Good on the MB developer for working on it, though). Ideally all of them would at least *support* screen-reader software so that blind people wouldn't have to trade off between features and being able to use software.


OK, so I run `bitcoind help keypoolrefill` and it tells me it 'fills the keypool'. That's... not helpful. When would I want to use this command? What are the dangers of using it? Why can't it automatically fill the keypool? For that matter, what *is* the keypool? The `help` command isn't helpful; it seems to know that you already know how bitcoind works, which is bad help UI.
Why does just looking up help commands even require a server connection?

It's not, obviously. But it is a weakness compared to the traditional electronic banking infrastructure.


You're not, but I see a lot of people on here saying that not only will cryptocurrency replace the current infrastructure, it'll be Bitcoin specifically.


Yes, and we're still paying for those sins, so to speak. (How's that IPv6 transition going?) 


They went after e-gold and Liberty Reserve because they were operating without a money transmitter licenses. As far as I know all the big US exchanges have a license. You haven't provided any evidence that the US has even *tried* to shut down bitcoin; if they wanted to try, they could pass a law saying that operating a Bitcoin exchange is illegal.


My point is that I don't like the current state of online communication. I think that it's a ramshackle mess that just happens to not have collapsed yet, with depressingly little formal math behind it; look at CryptoCat, where this guy was able to promote himself as writing this amazingly secure new online communication system despite the fact that it turns out he was actually pretty terrible at crypto. I'm inherently skeptical of *any* new cryptographic system that doesn't have some nice solid proofs behind it.

I don't know if it's possible to cheaply and economically transmit to a satellite.

The only case where you don't lose completely is where you're using some multisig thing where it sends the tx amount and address to your phone.

You can't use 2-of-2 multisig because whoever loses could just decide not to sign the transaction.

But malleability means that if you 'chain' transactions off of each other it's no longer safe for *you* to include them in the same block. If I want to make 10 transactions out of a given output (and I can't combine them because, say, I make transactions on demand), then without malleability I can just generate the 10 transactions, broadcast them, and wait a block or two. With malleability, I have to wait for each tx to get a confirm before I broadcast the next one, so it takes 10 blocks.
And as I said: most wallets will allow you to spend off an unconfirmed transaction that *you* generated, because presumably you're not going to try to double-spend against yourself. This is an unsafe operation in the presence of transaction-modifying relayers.

If you generate 1 billion keys every nanosecond (which would require a really extensive computer network) it would take about 10^12 times the age of the universe to generate a particular key. I think the odds of you losing one of the keys to a multisig address are vastly higher, and it's still possible for someone to generate the same multisig address as you anyway.

Suppose your hashrate as a fraction of the total is x, and you're currently paying off a fraction y of miners paying them n bitcoins per hash. Then your income without paying is 25x, and your income with paying is 25x/(1-y)-ny/(1-y). We get that this is  only useful when
25x &lt; 25x/(1-y) - ny/(1-y)
25x(1-y) &lt; 25x - ny
ny &lt; 25x-25x(1-y)

A public key Q is an element of some group with generator G, and the private key e is the number such that Q=e*G (i.e., the discrete log of Q to base G). S = d * P = d * e * G = e * Q. So it's the same basic principle of Diffie-Hellman, except conventionally Bitcoin key operations are written additively and not multiplicatively.
The more elaborate explanation that I wrote before your edit about DH:
So there's this mathematical concept called a 'group', which is basically a set that has an operator (in this case we'll call the operator +) that satisfies some relations:
* There's some identity element e such that e + x = x + e = x for all x
* (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
* For all x, there's some element -x such that x + -x = -x + x = e
You can multiply a group element by a number in the obvious way: 3*x = x + x + x, -2 * x = -(x + x) = -x + -x, etc. Bitcoin public keys are all members of a particular group based on an elliptic curve with a chosen element G, and private keys are numbers. If your public key is Q, and your private key is p, then Q = p * G. Going from p to Q is easy, going from Q to p is believed to be very difficult.
So, in this situation, d * P = d * e * G = e * d * G = e * Q.

Payee generates the (Q, d) pair at some time in the past. Payee then generates the (P, e) pair, call it a blind, and sends a transaction to the address H(eQ) + Q; in that transaction, they include P. For each transaction the payee sees, they check whether they have some blind P', and then checks whether the output of that transaction is Q' = H(dP') + Q; this will be the case only if dP' = eQ, which is true if and only if P' = P. The payee then computes the secret key for Q', which is equal to d + H(dP), and spends it.
The reason this works is due to the mathematical details of the elliptic curve cryptography Bitcoin uses, which I don't have time to go into just now.

I'd guess that it'd take about a second to start executing code on the target system. If the malware waits a minute or two, do you really think you have super awesome ninja reflexes that'll let you unplug it beforehand? Do you think the average user does?


The main 'payload' can be stored on the USB disk itself; all the malicious keyboard has to do is trigger the execution. Just run through various sequences like `win-r d:/a.exe` or `alt-f2 /mnt/media/a` or whatever until you get something.


While it's true that on Windows a malicious USB drive could just autoclick through the UAC prompts, if an attacker has executed code on a Linux machine they can, e.g., ptrace all your processes, muck with your .bashrc to set $PATH such that `sudo` tells the malware your password, modify your browser state...

Here, I made [a plot]( The blue line is the ratio of increase of the debt in nominal dollars (i.e., 1.10 means a 10% increase), the green line is the percent increase in inflation-adjusted dollars, using Table 24 from [here](
If you don't adjust for inflation, the debt increase does start getting larger around 1970. But if you do, it gets 'bumpier', with both high and low increase, until around 1980, where it spikes up to 17% or so and doesn't settle back down until 2000.

I don't buy it. Wiki edit history is a straight line, not a tree (at least in MediaWiki and most other wiki implementations); the version that's displayed is usually the latest version, but can sometimes be the latest *approved* version with certain extensions enabled. Wiki edits don't 'validate' earlier versions in any meaningful sense.
None of your examples really work.
Git is a tree, but it also supports merging branches, rebasing them, etc. It's also perfectly normal to have multiple divergent active branches, but this is considered abnormal in Bitcoin. It's also not true that everybody has the same view of the commit tree because they have unpushed commits, private branches, etc.

Right, but if the attacker gets enough 'future blocks' on the chain, then the median of the previous 11 blocks will also be in the future (about an hour in the future) and so announcing a block whose timestamp is 'correct' will fail because it'll look like it's from the past.

Also it's not true that the optimal attack against an n-bit hash is O(2^(n)) time; Grover's algorithm lets you do it in O(2^(n/2)) on a quantum computer. Which is still completely impractical for a 256-bit cipher, of course.

Attacker takes 1 BTC, splits it up into ten thousand 'dust' addresses via a 'normal' transaction, and uses those dust addresses to generate fake transactions.

The reason it's called a 'peer-to-peer' system is because it's a peer-to-peer system. Bittorrent is also one of these. So are DC++, eDonkey, Gnutella, etc.


I just searched the codebase; the only place the string 'torrent' shows up anywhere in the code is in `build-aux/m4/ax_boost_filesystem.m4`, which... I think it detects whether there's a specific version of a particular library. Not really P2P.

Let's do some math. According to Blockchain.info, the [global hash rate]( is about 40PH/s. The most efficient miner listed [here]( is 1.5 GHash/J; let's bump that up to 2GH/J. That means that the total power usage is about [20 megawatts]( (I used petameters because there's no 'hash' unit and I wanted to make sure I didn't mess up my dimensions somehow). So that's about [$333 per block]( probably less. There are around [400 transactions per block]( so the average electrical cost of a transaction is about $0.70. I think the author got the cost/transaction and the cost/block confused.
edit: She replied with the source for the $250 number; it's from [here]( which uses some really inefficient numbers (650W/GH is really high these days). And the article even points that out. So I think it's a combination of her only reading the headline and the author writing a headline even they know to be false.

Oh, I just noticed that you're using 'number of unique addresses per day' as a proxy for the number of people using Bitcoin. But your model assumes that that's proportional to the number of users, and you don't have any justification for that. What if it's the same group of people, they're just using Bitcoin more? Then there would be more uniques per day because of change addresses, most processing services generating a new address per transaction, etc.

That's not really answerable without me making lots of assumptions about a hypothetical quantum computer that I don't know enough to make.

The blockchain has nothing to do with this. All that a key update is is a message with the old key signing that the new key is valid. You don't need a blockchain for that. Bitcoin did not invent public key cryptography.


You can only receive *new blocks*. What happens if I transfer my key and the door misses the block?
Also, here's an attack. I'm somewhere in a coffee store. A and B are thieves who want to break into my house. A stands near my door, B stands near me. A initiates an Aureo unlock and forwards the challenge to B, who broadcasts it to my Aureo. B then forwards the response back to A. So unless there's some kind of manual authentication step where I have to say 'yes, I want to unlock my door' there's a huge problem here.

I agree that the process needs to be improved, but I don't think that 'just switch to Namecoin and let users choose their own CAs' is the solution, nor is a web of trust.

There exist formally proven optimizing C compilers, so I don't think that this is true. Proving the entire Bitcoin Core client might be difficult (I really don't want to think about formalizing a graphics library), but proving the part of it that signs transactions, verifies them, etc., would be easier.


You're missing the point; it doesn't take a dozen people to introduce a backdoor, it takes one person to 'forget' an array bounds check, or to mess up a string copy, and a dozen people to not notice. If that can happen to OpenSSL, one of the most widely used security libraries out there that provides security for a good portion of the Internet, why can't it happen to something relatively unused like Bitcoin?


Backdoors don't have comments saying 'THIS IS A BACKDOOR I AM EVIL!'. It can just look like a forgotten check, or an = instead of an ==.

In your case, it doesn't guarantee that the parties won't be able to determine the private from the working of the computation. For that you need indistinguishability obfuscation or something similar. You seem to confuse SMPC and obfuscation throughout the entire protocol.

Sure, and if someone steals that BTC from you you're completely fucked. If someone initiates a fraudulent bank transfer it's very much possible to get that money back.


MD5 [took about 12 years to break]( the fact that Bitcoin hasn't been broken in 4 years definitely isn't a proof of its security. In fact, there *is* no proof of its security under standard hardness assumptions (security of its primitives, P != NP, etc.), just evidence in the form of nobody having published any showstopper exploits yet. If you want Bitcoin to underly *the entire planet's financial infrastructure*, you should want stronger evidence than that.


You're making it sound like every single government is twirling their mustaches and trying to figure out how to shut it down. Have any of them seriously *tried*? That's like saying that your sand castle is invulnerable because nobody's kicked it over yet, when nobody's actually bothered.


Sure, and SSL is a specification written out in however many pages.

Wow, there's a lot of wrong information in this thread. Anybody who says that quantum computers can 'break any code' is 100% *wrong*.[1]
1. *A general-purpose quantum computer that can factor numbers on the scale to be a threat to Bitcoin is at least thirty years  out*. In fact, there are many quantum physicists who don't think scalable quantum computers can be built at all!
2. There is no proof that a quantum computer can instantly invert a SHA256 hash, or instantly break AES256, or whatever. Quantum computers can factor and solve the discrete logarithm problem efficiently, which means that you can go from a Bitcoin public key to the private key with a quantum computer. But bitcoin addresses are *hashes* of public keys; the public key itself is only revealed when you spend from it. So in the presence of quantum computers, the only restriction is that you never spend from an address twice. At that point, the protocol would hopefully move to post-quantum signatures; the reason these aren't used now is that they're very, very large.
3. Quantum computers *can* brute-force SHA256 exponentially faster than a classical computer using [Grover's algorithm]( However, implementing quantum-SHA256 would be extremely difficult, and at any rate we could just go to SHA512 and negate the speedup.
[1] As a trivial example, quantum computers can't break one-time pads because one-time pads are literally unbreakable.

Ah, ok, I did misread what your SMPC protocol was.


But the blackmailer can coerce the voter into retaining it. To elaborate: suppose your encryption function is *E_K(P, R)* where *K* is the key, *P* is the plaintext, and *R* is all the randomness necessary (nonce, IV, etc.). If the blackmailer knows they can get access to *E_K(P, R)*, then they can tell the voter 'when you generate *R*, write it down and tell it to me so I can make sure you voted the right way'.
It is possible to design protocols that are immune to this; a simple one is that your personal keypair also contains a 'blind' that is added to your vote when you encrypt it and then subtracted when the vote is computed. The voter can then say that their vote is whatever they want by lying about the blind, and since there is no way to find out what the blind is, the coercer cannot prove or disprove that they're lying.

Yes, and when I trigger a bug in a bank's Web interface that results in me stealing someone else's money, I'm just 'sending a message'. When I put my hand in my pocket, point my finger at someone, and tell them 'your money or your life', that's just me sending them a message.
All modern digital financial transactions are actually done via sending messages. If I get paid via my employer sending money directly into my bank account as opposed to a check (which is itself kind of a message!), do I not have to pay taxes on it?

The golden record was put in Voyager more as a symbolic thing than anything else, because Voyager's trajectory was designed to take it out of the solar system. It's not like Voyager was just launched just for sending a message; that'd be incredibly stupid and a waste of money.
Also, the golden record was the second such 'message'; the first was the [Pioneer plaque](
For more prosaic concerns: how would you encode multiple gigabytes of data in a way that's easy to read? You'd also need to supply, in addition to the blockchain, instructions for how to 'parse' it (SHA256, RIPEMD160, etc. are not universal constants!). That's hard, and it's not really clear what purpose that'd serve.

@_date: 2014-04-10 03:25:42
Oh hey I found the bug.
`org.multibit.viewsystem.swing.action.SendBitcoinConfirmAction.actionPerformed` tries to convert the number of coins to nanocoins (i.e., hundreds of satoshis) by passing it to `com.google.bitcoin.core.Utils.toNanoCoins`. The format that expects is the same as [the BigDecimal(String) constructor]( which doesn't allow commas. The value it passes is ultimately obtained from `org.multibit.viewsystem.swing.view.panels.AbstractTradePanel.getAmount`, which calls `org.multibit.Localiser.bitcoinValueToStringNotLocalised`, which calls the default English formatter... which inserts commas!
Ultimately I'm not sure why it's doing this sort of number formatting, since it seems to be localizing and then parsing and then localizing the number of bitcoins.

Really? What test do you have that distinguishes my output from its output? I ran all the tests they mentioned on their site and got similar results (similar Monte Carlo errors, similar entropy, etc.)
e: Here's my output:
    
    ~ $ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1000 count=100000 | ent
    100000+0 records in
    100000+0 records out
    100000000 bytes transferred in 6.323384 secs (15814318 bytes/sec)
    Entropy = 7.999998 bits per byte.
    
    Optimum compression would reduce the size
    of this 100000000 byte file by 0 percent.
    
    Chi square distribution for 100000000 samples is 248.02, and randomly
    would exceed this value 61.11 percent of the times.
    
    Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4900 (127.5 = random).
    Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141964446 (error 0.01 percent).
    Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000021 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).

I don't think you can make this argument, given that the difficulty/hash rate are increasing roughly exponentially, which suggests that we haven't found the actual equilibrium rate for the current block reward/total fees. Similarly, decreasing the total reward by, say, 50% wouldn't necessarily decrease the total hash rate by 50%; it's a complicated scenario, because the marginal revenue that a given miner gets out of adding more hashrate depends on what fraction of the current hashrate they have.


Again, not necessarily. I think that the economics of bitcoin mining is inherently nonlinear and so you can't just say 'double the number of transactions means double the fees means double the hashrate'.

It'd be trivial for a malicious browser extension to do this.

It's possible to securely generate vanity addresses; basically, you generate your half of the public/private keypair and give the generator your public half. Then they generate their halves until their public half plus your public half has whatever vanity property you want. They tell you their private and public halves; you add your private half to their private half and get the full private key. This is safe as long as you never tell them your private half. The flaw apparently was that there was a 'generate private key' button where you would *tell them your private half* and they would give you your private key... and then keep a copy for themselves.
If you want to get all fancy about it, it's because ECDSA public and private keys are isomorphic as groups, but only the 'public group' has an easy-to-compute group operation (assuming computational Diffie-Hellman is hard) and the isomorphism is a one-way function (private -&gt; public is easy, public -&gt; private is hard).

This is a good point, though you'd have to make it so that the average user only knows about their 'seed' key and doesn't have to be aware of the blinded keys. And you'd also need a way to manually generate a new address and add it to the keypool because you're probably not going to get 100% of all bitcoin software to support this.

The entropy of some random variable is a measure of how much 'information' it contains; if you have a coin flip, then since there's a 50/50 chance for each alternative, it takes 1 bit to store the result. But if it's a biased coin that lands one way 90% of the time and the other way 10%, there's less information since I can 'predict' ahead of time that it'll land heads both times; in this case, the information content is -(.9 * log_2 .9 + .1 * log_2 .1) = .46 bits. In the extreme case where it's a double-headed coin, the information content is 0 since I already know what'll happen before I even flip the coin!
Entropy is related to the quantity of different passwords; if each password has equal probability of being chosen, the entropy is just the log base 2 of the number of passwords. But if certain passwords are more likely, the entropy goes down.

Unless the attacker is wealthier than the parties or has more money to burn or whatever.


Like I said, Bitcoin can be arbitrarily inefficient if the difficulty is high enough. So basically anything else could be more efficient.


You already have a problem; if you have a way to reliably communicate to all the other participants, you don't need a fancy [consensus algorithm]( you can just have the leader *tell* the participants what color to paint the bike shed (and you can modify that slightly if you don't trust the leader, want to tolerate Byzantine failures, etc.). 


And the leader can also make up new members and send the coins to them to influence how the vote goes.
But this is besides the point; you could probably come up with something clever to use Bitcoin to take a vote, which is fine. But taking a vote isn't 'finding truth' and Bitcoin still isn't the 'ultimate truth machine'. It's not even clear to me what an 'ultimate truth machine' *is*; I think it'd be more accurate to describe Bitcoin as 'permanent irrevocable storage' or something if you were inclined to do so. But it's not truth.

Oh wait, I misunderstood what was saying.
If you have an ASIC that computes SHA(SHA(input)) then using that to break a SHA256-hashed password is simple: hash the hash and then run the ASIC on it, using common passwords and salt guesses. (Of course, if your ASIC hard-codes things like the length of the input or the value of certain bits, you're probably screwed.)

Also, bitcoind is bad from a UX perspective. Why does it tell me to create a .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file instead of creating it myself? Why are the manpage commands ordered alphabetically instead of by purpose (mining-related, account-related, address-related)? Although I guess that one's on the distro manpage authors, but the output of `bitcoind help` is similarly unhelpful, mixing in rarely used commands like `keypoolrefill` with common ones like `listreceivedbyaddress`. Why doesn't it say that it's daemonizing when I run it instead of just doing nothing and looking like it's hanging? Plus now people who want to use it have to learn a whole new technology set; most Windows users aren't familiar with the command line because cmd.exe is *extremely* painful.

    mkNat a | a &gt;= 0 = Just (Nat a)
            | otherwise = Nothing
And then you don't expose the `Nat` constructor. Now the only way to get a `Nat` is to use `mkNat`, so you can guarantee that `unNat` will give you a non-negative integer, and if you force the compiler to give you errors on non-exhaustive pattern matches you can make sure that you always handle the negative case.

1. If you wanted to make it tricky you'd give it a completely different extension like notawallet.doc or something and put it in a random location on disk. Extensions are just a convention, they don't actually mean anything. (Though you'd have to do some hackery to your client to get it to read from a file not named wallet.dat if you're using the reference client).
2. I can read the first 4 KB of a random file in about a milliseconds on my SSD. There are about 300,000 files on my computer owned by me, so it'd take all of 5 minutes to find the wallet. Less if you renamed it to something ending in .dat. Probably even less if you only looked at files with sizes in a certain range, recent modification time, etc.
3. Malware can generally list all the files that the bitcoin-qt process has open, which probably includes the wallet (I don't know, I haven't checked; this is also OS-dependent). So no amount of renaming will save you.
In short, this doesn't actually do anything. Instead of going through all that pointless effort, just pick a good password and be done with it.

You can't look at an article about the speed performance of D-Wave's adiabatic quantum computer and use that to generalize to all quantum computers everywhere any more than you could look at ENIAC and generalize to a modern i7 CPU.
The entire *point* of quantum computers is that there are certain problems that they can solve exponentially faster than a classical computer can because they don't work the same way as a quantum computer. Look at [the start of the Wikipedia article on Shor's algorithm]( integer factorization cannot be done effectively on a classical computer (as far as we know) but *can* be done on a quantum computer.


Sure. But using quantum computers for factoring isn't 'magic', it's one of the most well-established uses of them, which is why people talk about 'post-quantum' cryptosystems.

I don't think it'd make sense to silently accept a self-signed certificate because then if someone hijacks your DNS and redirects google.com to 66.66.66.66 they could just give you a self-signed cert, which defeats the whole 'authentication' component of SSL.

Google uses a lot of signals to present results, but it's wrong to say that the amount of actual searching is 'very limited'.

Hm. One approach would be for the central authority to have two kinds of keys, flipped and normal. A flipped key is treated as a vote for the other option. When you get your key, you're also told whether it's flipped; you can't prove who you voted for, since you could just be lying about whether it's flipped. But then you have to trust the authority to correctly 'unflip' votes.

No, you said that it breaks public-key cryptography, which I interpreted to mean 'it breaks all possible public-key cryptosystems'.


I'm saying that we have exactly as much proof that quantum computing breaks all asymmetric cryptography as we have that classical computing breaks all asymmetric cryptography (i.e., none). (Personally, I wouldn't be completely surprised if efficient factoring is possible, but I do think that there are cryptosystems out there that are immune to quantum attacks.)


No, you posted a link showing *one particular implementation* of lattice-based cryptography is vulnerable; there exist [other implementations]( that aren't vulnerable to the same attack.

No, it sounds to me like they do actually understand how change addresses work.


I got bored, so I sourcedove and found the origin of the 'no transactions over 1000 BTC' bug. Apparently it's because for some reason the code path that translates from the string entered into the 'send' window to the number of nanocoins to pass to bitcoinj involves 
1. Taking the text field and parsing it into, essentially, a BigDecimal.
2. Formatting that BigDecimal as a string (here, a comma gets introduced if it's greater than 1000).
3. Parsing that string as a BigDecimal (and here the comma chokes the BigDecimal parser).
It's weird that there's this extra round-trip of BigDecimal -&gt; String -&gt; BigDecimal when it should just be String -&gt; BigDecimal. That's what I was saying: a bug like this indicates a weird design somewhere in the codebase.

Actually impossible and 'impossible to the best of our knowledge' are two very different things. Proving that Bitcoin is secure would involve proving P != NP, which is one of the six great open problems in math right now as recognized by they Clay Institute.
That being said, I do think that P != NP, and I do think the Bitcoin protocol is not fundamentally insecure assuming that the relevant primitives are secure (though I'm much less certain about that!). But I'm not absolutely 100% certain.

1. You'd have to do all the transactions off-chain because the minimum fee that will actually get your tx included is about .1 mBTC (plus or minus a zero somewhere).
2. At current prices the most popular redditor of all time, (who has about 3 million karma) would have accumulated a grand total of $14. So what's the point?
3. If this ever gets valuable enough to be interesting, people will start being stingy with their votes and posting whatever they think will get the most upvotes, as opposed to actually interesting content. It'll make karma-grabbing a hundred times worse.

Well then, shouldn't it actually say what a keypool is? The entire help text for keypoolrefill is "Fills the keypool." I could figure that out from the name, so why even bother having a help entry?
I tried to start up bitcoind again to check the wording of the description, and it did the same thing: server was running but not responding. All I can tell is that it's doing something CPU-intensive. So that's also bad: there's no feedback at all on what I'm doing. `strace` tells me that it's reading all the blocks on disk into memory... why doesn't it say that? And why doesn't it respond to help commands while it's doing so? `bitcoind` is not a well-designed program for humans to use.


When did I bring up anything about passing a law requiring wallets to be accessible? 


Yes, because the author wasn't able to find any interface methods that were *good*; by the sound of it, there are no desktop bitcoin interfaces that are usable by the blind. Presumably web wallets are more usable since browsers are accessible, but they're also much less secure.

Except most users aren't on systems that have a development toolchain by default (i.e., Windows), so checking the source code is useless.
Plus, where are you getting the hash? If it's from the same place you're getting the code, it's just as vulnerable to being MITMed. Even if it's signed with a key, you need some way to know that the key is valid.
And you also have to do this for *every single thing you install* because the current desktop security model is 'once a user runs a process, that process can do whatever the user can', which includes keyloggers, messing with other processes' memory...
Basically, saying that Bitcoin security is easy because you can post an encrypted wallet online and not get owned is like saying that your house is safe because you installed a super-strong deadbolt.

They're not provably secure in the sense that we haven't shown that P != NP yet, i.e., we haven't actually proven that cryptography is *possible* outside of one-time pads and other cryptography that has a legitimate information-theoretical proof. It might be that RSA, ECDSA, AES, and all these other primitives we rely on aren't actually secure at all. They're only provably secure *under certain unproven assumptions*.
Of course, that doesn't mean that P = NP. It very well might be that there's no way to break SHA (although I've heard from some people that factoring is suspected to have 'too much structure', so RSA might be out sometime in the next 20 years). But it's still not a *proof*.

1. Transforming from a linear scale to a log scale will change your R^2 values.
2. Since adding more parameters can only increase your 'best' R^2 value, you can run into overfitting where people add like five parameters and think they're meaningful.
3. You need some reason to believe your model is the correct one. If you have 500 data points, I can give you a 499 degree polynomial that fits every point *perfectly*. Does tha tmake it an accurate predictor?

Forks are nothing like cancer at all. A cancer is an abnormal cell growth that can spread to other parts of the body. I.. don't understand how you can compare that to a fork.
3. I explained above why the virus analogy doesn't make sense; not all viruses have DNA, and the reason viruses don't get cancer is because they're not organisms for which cancer makes *sense*. Plus you probably don't want to compare bitcoin to something that invariably kills the host cell.
The point of an analogy is to explain or clarify. The virus and DNA analogies do neither.

This is demonstratably false. If you have the public key (*not* the address, but the actual key; in general this requires actually sending from the address) and a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, you can find the private key in a reasonable amount of time via a variant of [Shor's algorithm]( So address reuse is not safe in the presence of a quantum computer, and there might be other attacks as well (for example, you can't use any of the 'use bitcoin addresses to sign things' schemes).
Even if it was a brute force search, Grover's algorithm gives you an exponential speedup, not a '1000 fold' one. (It'd be very difficult to implement RIPEMD-160 or whatever on a quantum computer, but that's an entirely different problem).

Sure, but part of the problem is: how do you compile that open source compiler? [Someone might be trying to fuck with your compiler]( and so you have to bootstrap by writing a compiler *by hand* in assembly. That's hard.
Plus, different compilers will probably have different optimizations, different memory layout strategies, etc. I wouldn't expect two different compilers to compile a simple hello world program into identical assembly.
Even if you know your compiler is trusted, even if you're comparing identical compilers with identical invocation flags, it still might not generate identical binaries due to the aforementioned randomness.

The Spanish peso doesn't exist any more, but it didn't 'collapse', it was replaced by the Euro.

You generate your private half and your public half at the same time. You use your favorite address generator to generate some private key and public key, then tell Vanity Pool the public key. They do a bunch of computation, and eventually give you some public half so that the sum of the two public halves makes a vanity public address. They *also* tell you the private half for their public half, which you add with your private half to get the private address for the vanity address. The reason why this works is a bit involved.

I'd say that this is only true if you know the history is 'large'; it's definitely possible for another node to generate a short, low-difficulty history.


This is definitely not a valid assumption to make, given that nodes can vary from the occasional GPU miner to ASICs to the people running huge farms. With Bitcoin you basically have different levels of trustworthiness in each node, and you need &gt;50% of the trustworthiness to be non-malicious. 


The non-miners don't really participate in the consensus generation, they just provide input. A PBFT-based system would presumably also tolerate an arbitrary amount of malicious input.


This is a fair point.
In general, though, what the OP said originally is still wrong. PBFT is a distributed trustless consensus algorithm that came before Bitcoin.

If they can do this quick enough, then they can set up a series of nodes that would listen for transactions, reconstruct the private key from the tx (which reveals the public key), and then broadcast a new tx sending all the coins in the transaction to their own address.
Now, I don't think that the NSA has broken ECC, and if they have I don't think they can break it fast enough for this attack to be impossible, but it's not true that breaking it doesn't give you an advantage.
Also, I'd bet that plenty of users have one address that they spend from repeatedly, so normal users would definitely be affected.

Sure, the idea of a blockchain is really cool and I'd agree that it does things that haven't been done before. I just take exception to people saying it's the first answer to the problem, as if nobody had any idea how to solve BGP before Nakamoto published the blockchain paper.


According to Wikipedia (the most reliable source in the world!) there exist solutions with arbitrary amounts of traitors assuming that you have a signature scheme. So I guess in that sense it actually *isn't* unsolvable. Anyway, Bitcoin can't handle more than 50% of the miners by hashpower being malicious, which is a different kind of failure mode.
I just take exception to people saying it's the first solution as if nobody had ever managed to come up with *any* solution to it before Nakamoto did. Sometimes it feels like people want to build him/them up as this amazing cryptographer-king that came up with everything completely on his/their own, and it annoys me.

But that's just an ideal, and making slavery illegal is forcing everybody in the country to conform to it. The point I'm trying to make here is that you can't say that trying to force other people to behave in a certain way is categorically bad because that's what every federal law or universally enforceable ethical principle (such as the NAP if you're into that sort of thing) is.


So it's not OK for states to legislate about marriage equality, because that should be handled at the county level... except it's not OK for counties to do that, because that should be handled at the city level, etc. Where does it end?


Maybe the state I live in is a repressive shitheap, but the country as a whole isn't. In that case, unless I can push through a federal law I'm out of luck.

I don't know if that works. Micropayment channels have both a built-in time duration and a maximum amount of money they can transmit, so you'd wind up with a situation where you create a 100mXBT micropayment channel that expires in a month, and then you have to create a new channel every month or whenever you use up your 100mXBT allowance.
Micropayment channels seem more suitable for things where you know all the transactions are going to happen within a short amount of time.

This seems like it'd be a good way to make the Tor network choke and die under the traffic surge. Plus a lot of sites will just completely not work if JavaScript is disabled. It sounds like a good idea but realistically the Tor browser is not ready for the average Internet user to use as their day-to-day browser.
Plus even if they did, it requires them to use it *all the time*. One fuck-up and you can be connected. Do you think the average user has that sort of discipline? Bundling the Tor browser with an OS sounds like a good idea but in practice it doesn't work.

I suspect that there's a significant psychological cost to having to pay for something, though.
I read about an experiment at a university once where the experimenters put out some cookies by the cashiers; one day, the cookies were free, and another day, they cost 1 cent. Since they were by the cashiers, the added cost of buying the 1 cent cookie compared to taking a free one was basically nothing, but they found that significantly fewer people were willing to spend one cent on something than were willing to take it for free.
To put it another way: I'm pretty sure that streaming services do actually pay the artists per play, and there's certainly no technical reason why they can't charge per play right now. So why don't they?

Right, but the problem is this: A solar panel effectively gives you a certain amount of kWh free per month. Any excess over that you still have to pay for at normal rates from your electricity company.

Solar panels generally don't give you enough electricity to run your entire house off of them.

1. That's primarily bound by bandwidth, not latency.
2. The latency from where I am to my server is about 40 milliseconds. It was also 40 milliseconds 3 years ago. If we used the same 'double every 18 months' prediction, it would be 10 milliseconds.

So if I have 5 units of trust in A, and A has 3 units of trust in B, then I have at least 8 units of trust in B? So I trust B *more* than I trust A? And there's no way for me to trust B less than 8 units?


That's not what trust means in a cryptographic protocol.


Hashcash doesn't have a public ledger. It's sort of like a challenge-response protocol, except where the challenge is the same every time (the client keeps a database of responses so that senders can't just reuse the same hash, and the hash solution has to include a datestamp that's accurate to within 2 days).


I don't think that you can learn anything useful about the trustworthiness of someone by sending them $5. If someone's really hoping to con someone, they're not going to potentially blow the entire thing for less than the price of a good meal. It only works if you're working with amounts where 'take the money and run' becomes actually potentially worthwhile, and then at that point the people *sending* the money might not want to send it.

Their page makes a big show about how CSPRNGs are insecure, but I was able to get similar output from all their actual entropy tests with my software random number generator (running against some data I generated from `/dev/urandom` on my system produced as much entropy/bit as theirs did). Plus they plot the entropy pool size as if it's meaningful; I can easily input a megabytes of zeroes and tell the kernel 'by the way, increase your entropy estimate by a megabyte'.

* Not only does it have null, it has null *and* undefined.
* No way to overload ==, +, etc.
* == *and* ===.
* `this`. I've gotten bitten by that *so many times*, especially when I'm writing callback-heavy code, which is what JS encourages you to do.

You know what else has this property? The current system. Every tx that pays fees has value to the miner. The problem is that there's also value in broadcasting small blocks because of orphans; some pools believe that the current 'standard' transaction fee means that the expected decrease in value due to a longer propagation delay if they include that tx is less than the fee they'll collect.

OK. Well, I tried fitting a triple log-linear curve and I got R^2 = 0.95, so by my calculations in 90 days the price'll be about $17M. 
Then I tried fitting a quartic curve to it and got R^2 = 0.91, which means that in 90 days the price will be $701.
Then I tried fitting it to a degree 60 polynomial, R^2 = 0.95, and got that in 90 days the price will be -$9M.
So now I don't know what to believe!
To be less sarcastic: *lots* of things tend to have good R^2 values when you plot them on log-log scale by the nature of how R^2 values are computed. Hell, I just tried doing log-log regression against f(x) = x from 30 to 1000 and got R^2 = 0.90 even though my fit gives me that f(1100) = 2190 and f(1200) = 3146. To be even sillier, you can always fit a curve with n points exactly with a degree n-1 polynomial, but that doesn't mean it's the most accurate model of your data.

Huh, TIL. I was wrong.

You can also do this with [OpenOffice BASIC]( which has a filesystem API.


1. Does anybody even use ActiveX any more? Even if they do you need to actively choose to run it.
2. Firefox extensions can also do effectively arbitrary things.


According to [this link]( PDF viewers don't allow embedded executables to be run; the attack relies on running an existing binary on the disk. And so any Linux PDF reader that wants to be fully compatible has to support this.
I do agree that the package infrastructure makes it safe, although there's a fairly huge problem: any key that you add to your list of trusted keys can sign any package, so if you add someone's key so you can use their repo, suddenly they can sign your coreutils binaries. (Also, you'd think that admitting on that the centralized solution of a trusted package manager is superior to the decentralized solution of 'find software on the Internet' would be heresy...)

I'm sure that if Visa/MC stopped processing all transactions for a day or two people here wouldn't downplay it as 'minor inconvenience'.


And then when the attack ends, all that extra mining power is going to go away because it won't be as profitable any more.


1) If the attacker is smart then they would have their coins spread out over millions of addresses.
2) I get the feeling that *any* sort of address-based blacklist would be a very controversial move and not instantly adopted.
3) Even if it was, it's not like they have the ability to force miners to instantly update their nodes.

I don't think there's a good interface provided to the package manager; it's secure, but I wouldn't call it 'easy' unless you know what you're doing. I just launched Synaptic and searched for 'torrent' and in between the torrent clients (I have to manually click a button to get a screenshot? why?) is a bunch of system-related stuff like libapt that the typical end user has no business messing around with as well as developer libraries for torrent clients, which are going to be completely useless to said end users.
Also, don't let some of the decentralization fetishists here hear you advocate a centralized package manager as a more secure solution ;)

Your system has the problem that it favors kids who take classes with lots of questions. The reward should be relative to their grade overall on each test... except that favors kids who take classes with lots of test as opposed to project-based classes, so it should be relative to their grade in their entire class... except again, number of classes isn't necessarily going to be standardized, so it should be relative to their GPA, maybe with some kind of 'AP bonus' or whatever to incentivize taking harder classes.

I'm not talking about the keys used for communication; they're completely irrelevant to my point. Whenever I talk about keys in this post, I'm referring to what you're calling 'coin keys'.


One of the problems of bitcoin pseudonymity is that people might reuse addresses, and if they do that then it's possible to build up associations such as '1ABCD1234... = John Smith'. It seems like your system has the same problem if I keep collecting money that people pay me into one monolithic coin.
Of course, I can just generate different coin public keys every time someone wants to pay me, and maybe you'll enforce that in the protocol somehow. But then I can also just generate different bitcoin addresses every time someone wants to pay me as well. In other words, everything I would have to do to be anonymous under your system would also let me be anonymous under bitcoin. Because that's what your system is: bitcoin with no address reuse.


This is almost exactly what a bitcoin transaction is.

@_date: 2015-08-02 02:33:03
Sorry, this is completely wrong.
There are 10^(48) addresses, which means that you need to generate about 10^(24) to get even odds of a collision (this is the so-called birthday paradox). If there are 7 billion people on 1 billion planets in 1 billion galaxies and each of them has one address, then that's 7 * 10^(27) addresses, which basically guarantees a collision.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:27:16

How are the two different? If I have a bunch of coins and I spend them, then the flips will all have the same 'flipper' public key, which means that the flipping isn't anonymous. Same for if I'm the payee and request a bunch of coins be flipped to the same key.
As far as I can tell your entire claim of anonymity is based on the fact that coin keys aren't the same as the keys the payer and the payee use to communicate, which... doesn't have anything to do with anything.

The ratio of 'number of trials needed' to 'total size of the group' isn't linear, it's a square-root relationship.

@_date: 2015-08-09 19:09:01


And with bitcoin, you can make sure your public key changes after every transaction.


It sounds like [BIP70]( Why does the payment request even need to go in the blockchain? Presumably the payer and payee have some means of communicating already, they can just use that instead.


Again, in general a bitcoin transaction for, say, 100 mBTC might actually spend the outputs of a 70mBTC transaction, a 20mBTC one, and a 10mBTC one.


This is also true if I make a payment of 100 BTC to one address, 20 BTC to another, 2 BTC to a third, and 1 BTC to a fourth.

One example is the Internet: ISPs act as the hubs, and residential systems and servers and everything are the spokes. It's essentially like having a lot of centralized systems that are connected to each other in a distributed manner. Another example is [this airplane route map]( if Houston or Denver 'failed', many nodes would be disconnected.
In a distributed system, all nodes are in some way 'equal'. They're not *actually* equal; some nodes will obviously be more interconnected than others. Note how in the decentralized example, taking out a 'hub' node can cause massive connectivity loss, but in the distributed example no single failure can cause a network partition. One example of this would be [the US highway system]( Even if all the highways in any one state were suddenly destroyed, you could still get to anywhere from anywhere.

I think it'd be better if they kept the keys separate, personally. The universities might have different security requirements for them and they're used for fundamentally different things.
Actually, I just had an idea: have the Department of Education sign the university's key as part of the accreditation process. Now you can properly deal with the university's diploma certificate being compromised: just use OCSP to check the certificate status. And unlike browser OCSP, you can hard-fail if the check isn't valid, you don't have to cache (because diploma verification rarely needs to be instant and is a low-volume process), and you can enforce fairly strict timing requirements on stapled certificates, so you don't run into the issues that make OCSP completely useless.

Your argument is predicated on the idea that manually acquiring more bitcoin and sending it to whatever smart device is some horrible, awful process. But it's a process that the user is going to *have* to do at some point because one of the following will happen:
* The price in bitcoins of the service goes up, either because the value in bitcoins goes down or because the 'absolute' price goes up.
* They start using the service more.
* The miner becomes obsolete due to hash rate increase.
So, if the user is going to have to perform this difficult task in order to continue using their smart device (or to use it at *all* if they're a heavy user of whatever service), why should they pay dozens of extra dollars, plus dozens more in electricity fees, just to put off this mandatory 'setup'? Especially given that the setup process should only need to be learned once, and should transfer over to other smart devices.


That's an interesting example, because the *right* solution is for the computer to defrag itself at midnight every month or so, so the user doesn't have to think about it at all. And if the embedded miner could somehow be guaranteed to make enough money for whatever service it is, over the lifetime of the device and across all reasonable use cases, maybe it'd make sense to embed a miner. But you can't make that guarantee.
The fundamental problem is that embedded miners only make sense in a world where:
* The process of acquiring bitcoin and sending it to a given address is very difficult for the average user
* Lots of businesses accept bitcoin and are willing to get on board with whatever microtransaction system this winds up using (Bitcoin with larger blocks, Lightning, whatever).
I don't see that as happening.

The problem is that the statement that measuring a system in superposition puts you 'inside the box' with that system in a way that can later result in you retroactively having measures a different outcome is flat out wrong. If Alice has an electron and measures its spin and finds it to be spin-up, then Bob comes along and interacts with the Alice-electron system, he won't find it to be in a superposition. Alice's measurement collapsed it, so he will always find it to be spin-up.

The point of the article as far as I can tell is that contract law is a mess and contract litigation is a mess. I have no particular opinion on that, I'm not a jurist. The author then goes off on this tangent about how obviously those "scams" weren't actually scams, they were just GPG Contracts, which makes about as much sense as me saying that by reading this post you are entering into a contract where you agree to give me all your income in perpetuity. You might think that that's not possible because contracts require consent, but actually in a MistakeNotDotDotDot Contract only I have to consent! Your loss.
The author then talks about using GPG to authenticate identities, which... again, this was only ever a problem in certain circumstances.

That's not a good excuse. Most languages don't have a function named 'mysql_escape_string' that actually doesn't escape strings depending on your character set.

Either there are servers with some insanely high clockspeeds, or this person's laptop is from the 90s.
The author is also completely ignoring inter-node latency and the fact that presumably the math involved in secure multiparty computation is a bit more complicated than `i++`. The author is also *also* ignoring the question of how many 'steps' it'd take to do any computation worth anything. Are the fundamental operations of the scheme they had in mind additions/multiplications in some field? Are they boolean operations on bits?

My answers from least serious to most serious:
1. I dunno, how would you design a perpetual motion machine?
2. Take out all the networking drivers.
3. Use a formally verified OS kernel like [seL4]( Note that this obviously means you're not going to be using Linux, and I have no clue how hard it'd be to get existing software to run on an seL4-based OS, or how performant it'd be, etc., etc., etc. You also run the usual risks of formally verified software: you might not have verified the right things, or you might've handwaved some step (CompCert has had bugs found in it because there were parts that weren't verified). Even then, your userland code isn't going to be formally verified; I don't even want to think about defining semantics from scratch for something like nginx or Apache.
I'm not even an OS expert, this is basic background knowledge for people who are familiar with OS design.

So that means that, even in the 75% case, homicides due to prohibition make up .75/(1+.75), or about 42%, of all homicides. Which still doesn't support your claim.

They're claiming "No data can be stolen, even if a server is compromised." which... doesn't make sense. Clearly the server has to have *some* way to read the data, so if the server gets sufficiently compromised then the attacker can read it too!

has not provided any firm technical details beyond repeating 'self-healing meshnet blockchain decentralization' over and over. When I asked him how his 'secure OS' would handle stack overflows he said that it would require blockchain consensus before adding anything to the stack. It's obvious he doesn't know anything about OS design or security and I honestly can't tell if he's a scammer or just incompetent.
See my comments [here]( and elsewhere in that post.

Yeah, but if you assumed that single-threaded performance was going to grow exponentially indefinitely [you started having a very bad time in the early 2000s]( By my eyeballing of that graph, we 'should' have clock speeds of around 30GHz or so by now. But we don't!

But the technology for the 'contracts' the author mentioned has existed for about as long as we've had actual contracts. You don't need GPG for them given that generating new identities in the offline world is fairly resource intensive.

If you hire someone to kill someone in order to protect a website that sells drugs, that supports the claim that you were running the website at the time. The allegations themselves aren't evidence.


If Ross claimed he had secretly been brainwashed by government mind control and thus was not responsible for his actions, there would be no way for the prosecution to disprove this. But obviously that shouldn't work as a defense.

If I give one person the keys to my front door, another person the keys to my car, and a third person the keys to my safe deposit box, that's not more secure than me keeping all three of the keys myself.


Maidsafe is basically just storage. You can't distribute arbitrary computation in this way because nobody's managed to solve the secure multiparty computation problem in a way that's efficient. If these servers are going to do anything more than just store data and provide access to it, they're going to need to decrypt the data at some point, and neither Google nor Amazon is interested in letting the entire world see all their secrets.


So the hard drives won't fail, the operating system won't crash, the network connection will never go down? Does that mean that if I call my server a 'heating appliance that computes' I never need to perform maintenance on it?


The point of a data center is that all your data is near each other and so you can get petabytes of data all with microsecond latency. You *cannot* get that same latency if your data is all around the world because the speed of light is not infinite.


There are some cases where you want high latency, high bandwidth data transfer, but that's irrelevant. You can cross the ocean by cargo ship but I'd much rather take a plane.


What does this mean? If I have one, what's stopping me from disassembling it and pulling data off the drives, or from doing other nefarious things to the system?
