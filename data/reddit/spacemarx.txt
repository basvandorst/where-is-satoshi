I only ask because I have heard that it does and wanted to learn for myself. Thank you for your concise explanation!

I will not deny that that comment seems anti-bitcoin, but there are also comments that refute/question what the OP said.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:37:51
Thank you!

Maybe it means people care about their nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:31:20
I like how there are even more now.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:08:29
How exactly is that evidence? I'm actually interested.

Why is a UASF a good idea?
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:22:02
The tweet says bitcoin, just because he doesn't support segwit doesn't make it spreading propaganda. This is an idiotic misrepresentation of what was actually said, and you know it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:49:14
Can someone tell me why a UASF is a good idea?

Well, I'm going to use how Leon Trotsky defines propaganda as being used. "'Propaganda' in the evil sense of the word, is the name that people usually give to the defense and spread of such ideas as do not please them." - Leon Trotsky, Women and the Family.
It really is an apt description to how propaganda is being used in this context

Not exactly, they are acknowledging the issues that bitcoin is having, if you can give me comments that have a good amount of upvotes that actually are "rejoicing at bitcoin's mess" then I can accept it as evidence.

How do the channels work?
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:53:53
Is the lightning network separated from bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:33:56
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:17:42
Apparently you.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:43:58
Okay, he's against segwit; that doesn't make it propaganda, the title is purposefully misleading.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:32:46
That makes sense, are lightning transactions processed off the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:24:48
Being against segwit doesn't make it propaganda. It isn't verified context, it's just clarifying his position. Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make it propaganda.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:41:18
That's the best thing!

Not in modern times either, it is being used incorrectly. By using leftist you are trying to portray certain people as following the marxist school of thought. Marxism =/= liberalism.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:53:24
"Leftist" doesn't mean what you think it means.
