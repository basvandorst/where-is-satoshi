True or false? 
Don't rock pastebins usually have a datestamp with the time. 
Strange that Gonzop is more interested in asking Nanashi about data rather than asking Tux what happened. 
Based on past chats, Tux is very good at hit and run comments, and doesn't get sucked into name calling. 
That said, I don't understand why anyone would make the effort to fake this stuff.

If you're an exchange registered with the SEC that's probably true, but Gox isn't, it's just a guy with a website whose terms and conditions we've agreed to when we signed up, and he can trade his way out of debt (or deeper into it) just like any other business can. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:12:26
... And then pays them out to 80,000 disaffected Gox users who sell them all again. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:52:49

I think you'd be better looking at Ken Shiriff's blog. ( I think. Google it) He explains how to spot TM in the blockchain using push2 (I forget the details, but you'll see what I mean). A better methodology would be to link those transactions back to user accounts rather than speculate over withdrawal patterns that might result in false accusations. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:04:32
At the very least it shows the casual contempt which Gox had towards security of their customers coins. How can a half-a-billion dollar fund not have a system which knows exactly where and how much BTC are in it's control of at any moment? 
Edit: This admission is clearly ground for negligence.
Edit2: At the height of Bitcoin's value this forgotten wallet was worth a quarter of a billion dollars.

PayPal would be a logical place to offer a Bitcoin exchange service. Not a trading platform but a buy in or out gateway. Like a Coinbase service. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:39:09
Yeah an interesting problem. If the case were made, whoever bought those Bitcoin, wherever the end up, legally they belong to Mt Gox, and should be returned. This makes the innocent buyers of those coins ultimately liable for the loss. 6% of all Bitcoin in circulation is currently worthless. Like an anti lottery.

Green class action is for US citizens only. Canadian one is for Canadians only. Selachii are asking 2 BTC upfront for not going a great deal. Their final costs may rise to 7 BTC total by the end of the process. 
This offering is not for a class action, it's for the admin job of filing your claim with the bankruptcy court, something I hope will be done online when the time comes. Seems expensive. 
My thought on this is to wait for the bankruptcy proceedings to reach the next stage when there is hopefully more information available before making a decision. 
These are my views, not legal advice. If it goes to court, the money ends up in the hands of the most deserving: the lawyers.

Just been reading BF website. Here's two of their 3 aims: 
Protecting Bitcoin
Cryptography is the key to Bitcoin’s success. It’s the reason that no one can double spend, counterfeit or steal Bitcoins. If Bitcoin is to be a viable money for both current users and future adopters, we need to maintain, improve and legally protect the integrity of the protocol.
The reason no one can steal bitcoins? We've just had 1 in 12 bitcoins lifted from under our noses. Do go on.
Promoting Bitcoin
In the context of public misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations, Bitcoin needs to be clearer about its purpose and technology. Allowing the community to speak through a single source will enable Bitcoin to improve its reputation.
Well lets hear you speak brothers. Do some reputation improving. Its not enough to say there's one rogue exchange, the reputation of bitcoin is that it allows for rogue exchanges.

In aviation if you had as many planes crash as Bitcoin has exchanges crash you'd conclude something is wrong. It may not be the plane design, but there is something fundamentally flawed in the system that makes this continually happen. Stop blaming the victims. Exchanges are an integral lunch pin of BTC's interaction with the rest of the world. The system demands thatcher trust them. It's nice hood saying "leave your money in there for a short a time as possible". That's not the solution.

I don't see why. I get all the decentralised beauty of BTC, but if the community wanted to make it right for so many of it's members that would be a much more powerful positive endorsement than hanging people out to dry. I mean people are committing suicide over this. Lets set a fucking precedent. Anyone that loses more than half a million bitcoins can appeal to the community for help, make a case, and if the community agree, fork it. that's a currency I want to have a piece of. Thats a much better currency than the currency citibank lost 400m of today. And great PR for BTC to compare outcomes from these two stories. A positive outcome for BTC holders while USD holders lose it all. Watch the adoption spike.
As I understand it, it's ultimately a decentralised democratic decision anyway. Miners will decide if they want to fork or not, and whatever the majority decide is what happens. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 07:16:22

One last thought, cos I'm really ranting now. And this time it's more on topic. I got a bit tired of hearing this idea that if you lose your bitcoin key then consider it a gift to the community as the value of all other coins theoretically goes up. So as ~6% is lost, I posed the question on Reddit, "Would you be willing to donate 6% of your bitcoins to Goxers if the coins are found to be unrecoverable?" I wasn't really expecting anyone to say yes, but the barrage of insults in the replies was so down-heartening I deleted the reply.

@_date: 2014-03-05 02:29:43
Not sure about the last paragraph, but is this what MK meant when he talked about persuading the court to allow him to return coins with coins? I really hope not cos a Goxcoin is worth 5% of a BTC on bitcoinbuilder, and seeing as they have forensically tracked considerable BTC to Gox's control I'm not going to be fobbed off with a Goxcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:25:20
An outrageous bit of racist stereotyping. Why not give us you're analysis of how their "slanty eyes" or diminutive stature will effect the price too? FFS! Good luck making money out a market using analysis based on prejudice and bigotry. 
If this was going to happen it would already be happening. The price only went as far as 1200usd when any and all Chinese investors were able to buy in. So you really think it's going to reach 1000x when just a corrupt elite are able to buy in?
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:56:19
I was a bitcoin evangelist, but I've been turned off bitcoin this month, not just because I've lost money on Gox, but moreso because I'm discovering the reaction and motives of my "fellow" bitcoiners. There's a really unpleasant greedy streek. That's not the ethos I thought was behind bitcoin. Creating an open system, that responded to the community that uses it. It's become a mix of big investor interest with all the mainstream financial PR techniques, and small time sharky dealers thinking they can get rich if they just stand on the people around them. If I get ever my coins back I'll sell them within minutes and be done with bitcoins even though there's clearly some more upside years before the whole thing eventually crashes.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:50:23
I think that's a valid point, but i think you underestimate the value of bitcoin as a means of transferring money, and are failing to see the adoption it has had in the last year. I think 250-300 might be a more realistic settling point. We'll see how China reacts when it wakes up to Monday morning. The next two weeks will be a continued decline until there's some clarity from PBOC, but even if that comes in favour of BTC, the damage is done. The fear that PBOC could pull the plug will forever be there looming large in the minds of those that have just lost a pile in this fall. They won't buy back in in the same numbers. Lots of downside, but not much upside risk.
Longer term, 12 months, we'll see more steady rises, but nothing stratospheric, as Wall street starts to come on board and apps and userbase grows slowly, and the memory of Gox fades in the public perception. But I think it will take a long time to be back to 600.
My opinion may well be wrong, and others may well be right. No one knows the future.

I wondered about that, but in the end I concluded that these were the words of someone that's had a really stressful fortnight, not much sleep and is speaking in a second language. It sounds to me more likely to be denial on his part, and clutching to the hope something can be saved. Hope I'm wrong, wouldn't it be good if he'd just misplaced the key to the safe deposit box, but having lost a much larger chunk of my savings that I can afford to I'm trying to move through the stages of grief, from denial, to anger, and all this speculation keeps dragging me back to denial. In fact, why am I looking at Reddit again? Grrr.

Ask DPR how that works. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:29:32
Adam, I've got so much respect for your opinion, but this feels like a way of sideliniing the debt and claims of all the bitcoin holders at MtGox so that someone can step in and buy it up. (can you confirm that mtgoxrecovery.com aren't behind this scheme and an attempt to buy gox? Do you have any links to this group you want to disclouse?). The court demands a 50% agreement for debt restructuring from creditors. This feels like a campaign to get that 50%. 
If people want to trade their claim, then set up a currency, or exchange, which allows individuals to opt in to it. (Note that bitcoinbuilder is shutting down because presumably there isn't an appetite for it, and it's too much effort to run). 
But what you're suggesting forces us all to join in to what seems like an expensive to manage solution, while relieving the pressure on Gox to find the coins. It really feels like being fobbed off so someone can muscle in on Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:56:27

I'm so sick of hearing that BS. SN clearly wasn't talking about 7% of the total economy being wiped out. If you really believe it then donate 7% of your holdings to people that lost coins on Mt Gox. 
If you think that's the net effect of Gox's collapse on bitcoin you're dreaming. Try massive reputational damage for bitcoin that's put adoption back years, and litigation with their banking partners which poses a real threat to the infrastructure of all exchanges and bitcoin as a whole.
Enjoy that donation.

I don't get how this will work. Gox are still under bankruptcy protection in Japan which prevents them from making any spends.

Can someone illuminate me on my mistake.

Here's an alternative view; After the hack of 2011 MK decides that he's going to design his own cold storage system using php and some old starbucks cups. He diligently juggles all the coins out of the old cold storage printing the keys on the inside of the used cups. But towards the end of the php script the cat walks on the keyboard and stops the process. MK doesn't realise there's still 200k to go and sweeps up the cups so far and puts them in a cupboard. 
A few months later MK's mum comes to visits and finds the cups in the cupboard and start using them to make her little baby coffee in the morning which he carries to work. While he notices a strange taste he doesn't realise its the printer ink dissolving and disappearing into his gut. 
Eventually someone steals enough btc through TM that MK has to go looking for the cups only to discover what maman has done. Horrified by the loss, he inserts an endoscopic camera in his arse to try to find the ink particles and reconstitute their pattern through their magnetic signature, assuring everyone that they coins are not lost just yet. Sadly the camera forces him to bow everytime he stands up and he is unable to shit until all the ink particles are found, causing a slightly terse smile on his face.
I think you'll find my theory is consistent with all the evidence we have so far.  
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:28:46
Yes, that's true, but usually when they confiscate something, they take it out of your reach. Like a car or money. They don't just leave it with you with a warning not to use it. Thinking about it, in a sense he was using it, as a reserve fund for the exchange, so without spending it he'd have been breaching the confiscation terms. 
Ah who knows. I'm no lawyer. I'm basing this on having watched a couple of episodes of Law and Order.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:41:55
Yeah. Bam. Although it would be nice to know which bits are more and which bits are less.
It sounds like he turned to the other exchanges for investors revealing the situation, and they leaked the draft info, and released the joint statement revealing the insolvency to the public, rather than deciding to wade in to help Mt Gox investors and the name of bitcoin. Their entitled to make their business decisions, and I'm sure they did the maths and it didn't add up.

I had a little peak and started seeing a few bugs but then I hit line 1009:


I haven't done much digging around this issue (so perhaps someone can enlighten me on this) but I was curious at what was at that domain (since it seemed the email was going to Mark Karpeles). When I went to the staff page[1] I could see his company Mutum Sigillum LLC takes care of the administration for that IRC network. That same staff page used his nickname MagicalTux and the corresponding page[2] links to his "Professionnal PHP5 certification"[3] but that lists his name as "Robert Karpeles" and not Mark Karpeles. Does anyone know why this is? Did he change his name between 2006 and now?
[1]  [2]  [3] 
Edit: After more digging and looking at his test scores and code, I have come to the conclusion that this guy's skill level is not what he thinks it is. Here is my favourite: 
Notice his fix to stop local file inclusion vulnerabilities in PHP, apparently he has never heard of a null byte.

Well yes that's all true. But the problem is bigger than Gox. We still don't know which of a number of scenarios played out at Gox. But regardless, each scenario represents a real threat to BTC exchanges and their users. So far I haven't seen much momentum towards addressing the risks: owner accountability (who even owns BTC-e? ) with an industry wide insurance/consumer protection scheme, proof of non fractional reserves, systematic organisation-wide security protocols and use of banking standards of security, transparency of law enforcement actions...
I'm not saying I know the answers and these are them, but I'm saying I don't see anyone presenting solutions. The response has been to blame Gox or Gox users while the issues remain unaddressed. 
And PS if Gox ever tried to come back the only way it could hope to survive is if it would need to be all over these issues in such a transparent and convincing way that it would leapfrog every other exchange to become the most trustworthy exchange.

The hacker from last weeks leak is offering our personal data to anyone for 100btc. - to cover their own losses. We've all been fucked once, now this hacker is fucking us again to save their own arse. Nice community we have here.
Account balances are already revealed in this database dump from today. Having everyone's private account details in the public domain may make it harder to verify your claim if/when the time comes to make it. Especially if someone else has copies of our ID.
I wish the hackers would consider the fact that we've all been fucked once, and having them dump this information in public in fit of petulant anger is probably making the process towards recover harder.

I think even the Japanese Bankruptcy laws will work quicker than that. 
What's found and available should be uncovered pretty fast. The rest will drip in over years. 
Anything that trickles in a year from now, we can all stare at them on the blockchain, and think there's my money, right there. The protocol prevents their recovery without a fork. Just saying the word fork on this forum is blasphemy. So Goxcoins will drop in price with time as hope fades.
Aside: I've always thought that tracing stolen coins is actually a big threat to the survivability of Bitcoin. Anyone buying coins may find that some of what they've bought is stolen and has to be returned to it's owner at their expense. With 7% of all coins in circulation stolen that makes buying any new bitcoins risky.

Yeah, this moral hazard thing has gone a little far now. There isn't another major exchange that doesn't have serious risks associated with it. 127000 people were invested in Gox so it wasn't that looney an investment. 12 months ago there weren't really any alternatives. And everyone has been blown away by the magnitude of this loss. So while I get the point I think its a little harsh to preach I told you so when the events have surprised everyone.

In the comments Ken says: Ken Shirriff said...
Andy: I can't figure out what MtGox lost for two reasons. First, if signature malleability is their problem, the "bad" transactions will drop out of the system leaving only the "good" transactions, so there's nothing unusual to find in the blockchain. Second, I don't know what addresses MtGox uses.
MtGox transactions have failed often in the past due to a bunch of issues (missing fee, transactions too large, double spends) as well as invalid signatures. So it seems like there's a long history of faulty transactions.

Same pattern with two other time stamps both within a few minutes that *might* be related. Feb 7, 2014 12:11:42 AM (three wallets with total ~120kbtc) and Feb 7, 2014 12:36:31 AM (two wallets with total ~50kbtc)
However, those 10k wallets (I looked at 2-3) and they seem to be fed by a similar pattern and may well be related. But even if they are, they could belong to anyone.

No they won't, you smurf. They have to be funded by bitcoins, which mean someone has to buy bitcoins to back them. 
The Winkletinkles have already bought and own all their coins, so their Winkerfund won't make any impact. Some investors will give their cash to Winkydink Inc., instead of buying BTC direct, but they're probably not the wild and crazy types like you who are happy to see it all vanish into a decentralised cloud of hacking and theft, so that's all extra money BTC wouldn't see otherwise. 
Second Market though is yet to stock up so they will have an impact on the market. 
All these yanks bleating about how many BTC they are going to buy is just a pile of willy waving. They won't make anything like the dent that 1bn chinese looking to circumvent currency regulations made in November December. Can't see more than a 5-10% blip coming. 
Hopefully the legitimacy these funds lend BTC will drive adoption by creating some reliable regulation, and that will indirectly move the price upwards.

Looking at a couple of these 10k wallets it looks like they are all fed from similar patterns that *could* be consistent with feeding from an exchange hot wallet management system.
It looks like its not inconsistent with an exchange with a lot of volume, but Gox wasn't the only exchange. Given the volume, 1,200k BTC, it could be Bitstamp and the movement coinciding with when they shut up for the day to react to TM? Iwas that the 5th?) or BTCe? 
Or it could be Gox...
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:23:44
interesting, thanks
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:25:17
Lol. Downvotes won't stop it happening if it's true. Time will tell. 
1200 happened because Chinese money was using BTC as a way to escape their country. Now that's restricted its hard to see another cash influx that would ever drive the price so high again. 
Mass adoption is a long way off and looking less likely right now given that all the mainstream Bitcoin news is about security and massive losses. 
Currency success isn't measured by the exchange rate. It's measured by adoption, and exchange rate is an indirect effect. 
If you buy the cyclical models, based on the previous spike cycle the price should settle out around 300. Then we'll see what it does next. Hopefully that will flush all the moonchasers out of the market and take some of the volatility with them. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:30:34

I've felt this too. And a really unsympathetic, antagonistic attitude towards investors that lost out. The logic is that you're stupid cos you lost money, now stop spoiling our party with your whining. 
This is a massive issue for BTC. 7% of the value disappears, the most recognisable exchange exposed as a grossly amateur operation. People keep saying Mt Gox is not Bitcoin. But right now, it absolutely is. In the eyes of the public, the lawmakers and investors Bitcoin is a at best a laughing stock, at worst toxic, because of Gox. It's the ONLY story, and if you can take your eyes off the chart hoping for the line to breech 700 then you might start to see that this issue is far more important the Winkelvii going into space. 
The price isn't holding steady, or rebounding, defying Mt Gox news, it's down from a steady 900 because of Gox. Voorhees is dreaming if he thinks we can just bury this with some poetic prose. This needs fixing, and if Bitcoin wants to avoid regulation, and a massive set back in adoption, then it needs fixing from the inside, (the community, and the BF) not by some Japanese court that doesn't know a bitcoin from a chocolate button. But the community wants to blame the victims into silence, and the BF is in disarray. Why aren't they performing the forensics tracing the coins, why aren't they issuing information in the absence of any one else. Why is this being forced to happen in an uncoordinated unconfirmed way on reddit. 
Bitcoins are supposed to be traceable. I find it staggering that weeks into this no one can tell me where these coins are? This is a financial and PR disaster that has the very real risk of totally derailing Bitcoin. Yeah, lets talk about something else.

@_date: 2014-03-28 09:49:51
I'd guess it was more about adoption than volume. The same money moving around the market more often (increasing volume) doesn't create wealth, it just moves wealth, and does so even more efficiently. However new entrants bringing cash into the system not only increase capitalisation but also establish a wider base for BTC to be used as a currency and consequently adopt the characteristics of a currency. Both of which make it more valuable (a higher price).
That's my opinion. Nice question. Thanks.

@_date: 2014-03-30 05:26:31
It seems this analysis focuses on looking at historical prices rather than market fundamentals.
I see two mechanisms at work. A steady growth and a sudden growth.  I also see a volatility caused by speculative traders following graphs (network effect).
There's been an overall steady growth of adoption with a reflection in value. In November a big spike was driven by large scale adoption from China. That adoption may now be at risk, and that risk is reflected in the price. The sudden growth is being reversed. If Chinese investors are removed from the market the price will drop further, if not, it will likely rebound. Well know in 2 weeks.
Assuming a continued rise in adoption then the underlying price will continue to rise steadily after a correction for Ed Chinese outcome. It will continue to exhibit volatility. However I believe that the reputational damage of high profile losses (will curb new users adoption and the steady rise might not be slowed and possibly reversed. 
The chances of rapid growth of the past being repeated as a new market is suddenly exposed to Bitcoin are low because it's hard to see where such markets exist. 
Of the BRIC countries, India has very restrictive capital controls (not even allowing paypal). China I've mentioned, Russia has recently ruled against Bitcoin, and Brazil (I think) already has as much adoption of BTC as anywhere else.
The MINT countries might be a better hope. I don't know enough about the banking systems and capital controls in these countries to know if it's likely. (Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Nigeria). Of the 3 countries I've visited, Nigeria feels like the most promising hope for BTC. - a statement which in my mind speaks volumes. But fundamentally BTC benefits country with capital controls that overlooks BTC, but that will always be a temporary situation so this method of rapid growth will always be followed by retraction as governments react.

Yes, that's how I read it. I think the consultants were actually employed by Janssens/mtgoxrecovery, and MK allowed them into Gox gave them privileged info because he was hoping to sell Gox to them. But when they found the extent of the trouble they bailed and someone leaked the draft crisis strategy document. This explains it's tone critical of MK. 
But in an attempt to write off the +$400m BTC debt to allow restructuring they are trying to shift that debt over to Goxcoins and let us carry the debt. That's how it seems to me. But if anyone can present another explanation I'm happy to hear it.
Edit to clarify.

Let me have a go at a TL;DR from my understanding.
there's 120 wallets each with 10,000 btc in them. They are all linked because they have all been marked by someone sending 777 satoshi to each one from the same address (an android wallet) 
The 10,000 BTC all landed in their wallets on the 5th of Feb
The link to Mt Gox is that few others could have this much coin, and the 5th of Feb makes it coincide with auspicious period at Gox - tenuous but worth investigating.
Correct/add if I'm wrong.

The threats I see is that it will become an institutionalised tool as corporate money flows in. Which won't kill it but will kill its ethos.

MK knew everyone was watching. It was all over the place. Reddit, bitcointalk, LTB. His buddy Shrem knew about these coins. Even I knew about them. He was hardly going to pocket them in full view. 
I woke up to an email from lord almighty Bitcoin saviour OJ claiming credit for having forced MK to fess up about the coins. Undecided which of the two I find more slimy.

Where am I misunderstanding : Coinbase costs 1pc to convert currency, so 2pc total for dollar to BTC to dollar. Compared to 3pc for PayPal, but with no consumer protection. PayPal is insured and regulated so can't run off with your money, and will pay you even ifvthe get hacked.  Coinbase, who knows. 
And if the price is shifting between buying, transaction confirmation and selling, the merchant can lose out? Seems like not much advantage over PayPal.

Well youre confusing Newsweek with Reddit. That would be called false representation, which would cost newsweek a lot of money and the journalist their job. To print a quote journalists take contemporaneous notes, which are admissible in court as proof of a record of a conversation, or more likely they were recording the conversation on their phone. Perhaps if you really give a fuck, honestly and genuinely care enough, you can email the journalist and they can tell you which.

We'd already seen this 200k moving on the block chain. I was happy about it a week ago. Now realising how it's been found, I'm sad about the other 75% which seems irrevocably lost.

I'm not sure that's credible enough for a joint statement with such power. Unless the 'five families' know more than they are saying. The Two-idiots blog need to reveal more info about their source for this document.

Is it also consistent with preparing to launder it? The timing seems funny to me for preparing a hot wallet. Surely Gox would get the claims in first. There's going to be a fair percentage that don't claim their coins cos they have trivial amounts, or because it's illicit money. The process of letting people apply for claims will take a while, probably a month at least, dictated by the court. Why move the coins into hot wallet until you need it?

Investors often confuse the usd value of bitcoin with it's success as a currency.
Bitcoin fails to be a viable currency when it's volatile. It won't gain mainstream adoption until there's a consistent period of price stability. Ironically it looked like we were starting to have that in the last months.
@_date: 2014-03-11 05:46:02
How would that work? You attack the servers and somehow get access to their back end, which shows you the software they use to create the wallet passwords?
If that many coins had moved on the blockchain even over several days wouldn't it have shown up like a red flag?

This correspons with a previous chat in which he said fiat holders would be converted to shareholders and Bitcoin holders would be paid out with BTC. He said that in response when asked why the Bitcoin debt was not included in the bankruptcy filing. - this is all from shit I read on reddit so who knows. 
Let's hope he's found some coins cos Gox is not worth 400m. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:40:52
If they'd lost all hope the would have filed for bankruptcy and started liquidation, not bankruptcy protection. However the question remains is Mark delusionally trying to recover the Bitcoins, acting out of desperation or does he have a realistic chance? I only know what I've read about him and between the insults I'm hoping he's technically savvy enough to know his limits. But hope is all I have.

MK and his lawyers aren't so stupid as to realise that there is evidence on the blockchain. I think this article gives the most coherent explanation so far. 
Maybe the keys were stolen or locked during the attack. That seems the most likely explanation that fits their actions and statements throughout. 
I think MK is still liable for gross negligence for Gox's security practices, and while I don't predict MK going to prison, I do see him being bled dry by civil claims. I feel for his wife and kid, as I feel for investors who lost out.

The coin will be worthless because there's no information in the market, and doubt causes the price to crash. Bitcoin builder is trading at around 5% despite the fact that people claim to have found half the missing bitcoins in Gox wallets. There's no clear correlation between price and risk because the situation is so opaque, and that decimates the value of this proposed Goxcoin.

I think he's lost more than the keys, he's lost the addresses too. It could be scattered all over the blockchain in tiny wallets. I suspect the wallet management software failed and he's now got no record of where these coins are nor what the keys are. 
Perhaps he hasn't listed the BTC cos in the ToC it states the coins remain the property of their owners. This could be argued to make a difference at bankruptcy, and it would take a subsequent civil case you prove liability through negligence to make mk/gox/tibane liable. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:45:28

That's my point. I'm sure a technical solution can be used to reliably show how many bitcoins an exchange has, but a malevolent exchange could just lie about their liabilities. They could lose bitcoins and then just claim to have customerbase with smaller balances to make it seem like they can cover everyone's accounts.
So it's not really possible to prove an exchanges solvency.

Hey Ryan, as well as taking legal advice, also take a moment to think about the ethics of what you're going to do. if you think it might jeopardise the slim chance of this situation ever being resolved for half a million Gox users (which if you need legal advice, I suspect you might), as well as the damage to bitcoin, then please weigh that against the excitement and thrills of being at the centre of this storm, and write your blog in a way that respects those people. 
FWIW As an investigative journalist I've been fed amazing scoops, only to discover when the dust settled that I was being played and my ego and aspirations blinded me to it. You say you have ALL the pieces. Are you really sure? Have you had this confirmed from more than one source?

Why is everyone so upset at the thought that this is the guy, or that he's been discovered. What does it matter. Chill out everyone.
Newsweek isn't Reddit, they have professional journalists who know how to research a story and understand liable laws, invasion of privacy laws, the legal consequences of inaccurately report quotes, have editorial guidelines to follow, and end up in court if they don't. 
Why don't we launch a crypto currency valued on the identity of SN, if it turns out to be this guy the price goes up. You can sell if you like.
I bet he lost the keys, and is so pissed he doesn't want anything more to do with it.

@_date: 2014-02-27 16:00:22
They have, every time they've been quoted. 
Kolin's run in with CFO(?) of Gox said they said they were solvent.
Sarah from Gox Support quoting the company line said in an IRC "your bitcoins are safe."
And in IRC Karpeles says he's not lost the coins yet, they are just temporarily unavailable, (paraphrasing).
I have just read a post in which the poster describes finding 200,000BTC in the blockchain in one of Gox's addresses from the last time Gox showed their solvency.
Loosing 744kBTC over two years without noticing? That's half a million dollars a day. Every day. No Fucking Way. It's there somewhere. And it will turn up.

Thanks, you've more than answered my question. 
My question was actually in relation to Gox's "lost" coins. Given an absense of movement on the blockchain one theory has been that the private key(s) was stolen. 
If someone obtained a copy of the private key they couldn't "change the locks" without moving the coins and being visible on the block chain.
They'd have to delete or corrupt Gox's copy of the key to prevent their access. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:20:15
So would this theory account for their missing fiat as well as coins?

Oh, Ok. I understand now. I feel bad for spamming my misunderstanding all over Reddit. Its just a mechanism for sharing out whatever is recovered. Still not entirely sure what happens to the coins recovered from Gox as they are found. Do they stay in a repository, a bit like a gold reserve on which the value of Goxcoins are based (along with the addition of assumed future value).
Thanks for clarifying.

I don't know if this is relevant but Jed has a new startup and may be reorganising funds for that. 
I read somewhere that the 7th Feb coins had been mined into that account, so unlikely to be Gox deposits. 
I could be wrong on both of the above but something for the technically able to check. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:46:38
Reopening has to be approved by the court. That's not going to happen in 10 days time. Reopening has always been Gox's intention. That's why they are in bankruptcy protection and not in liquidation already. It's no secret.

Is it confirmed that Mandalah was hired by Gox, and not by whoever MK was trying to offer Gox too. More likely it was the potential buyer who hired Mandalah, no? Or maybe Mandalah was the potential buyer. The language in the leaked report didn't read like an internal document, but more like a plan for someone taking over.

But effectively they do though Adam. They get ~$400m of debt written off, and that allows them to restructure and find a buyer/shareholder to cover their fiat losses. 
They can take this proposal to the court and say, we've found a way of sidelining the debt from lost bitcoins, and here's an investor to cover the lost fiat. 
Those of us holding bitcoins get nothing out of this. the Goxcoin is little more than an acknowledgement that we lost money. It removes the incentive to find the coins. If it was a system that allowed us to opt in by pledging our future claims to mastercoin or whoever, just like you can chose to buy in to Bitcoinbuilder, then fine. But this can't be something that Gox uses to sideline their debt in court.

I think he has the bombshell ready, but the court process will determine the drop time.

This is all a bit "People's Judean Front". I don't think new money comes into B*C when it's so confusing for new entrants. 
We should all be fighting the Romans!

Sell your 401k and buy bitcoin? Seriously?

Hi Mark, thanks for taking the time to meet me when I was in Japan. 
I had a couple of questions: Jed has said he sold his shares to Brock Pierce, who confirmed that to me, but I understand you don't think the sale is valid? Can you explain why not?
Is there a legally binding step you could take now to pledge any future monies that flow to you to be put in trust for the benefit of creditors?
When did you become aware of the sale of BTC by the trustee announced at the last creditors meeting?
