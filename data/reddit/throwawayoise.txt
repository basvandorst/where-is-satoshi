What exchanges are you at?

These are dark days for bitcoin in Canada. The new year is supposed to bring in good things - within the first two months two of the largest (out of three) bitcoin exchanges shut down. Vault of Satoshi because they weren't as profitable, and Cavirtex because of a compromised security system.
I think this isn't necesarily a sign that bitcoin is doomed, but that it is still extremely early in bitcoin's overall maturity.

If I'm not mistaken, withdrawals are still frozen at the moment. Why wait unil the end?
When a company says they are going out of business, that is a good sign to get out earlier rather than later.

When I heard about vault of satohsi closing, I used my fiat and bought bitcoin and withdrew the bitcoin. 
There is nothing you can do other than wait and to keep trying to contact them. I believe when they announced that they were closing, they'd be scaling back their staff. They might not even having anyone working their full time.

Did you withdraw in fiat?

With all the hacking against exchanges in 2015, I'd be hestitate to have an account with any exchange that doesn't have tons of VC money behind them.

Here is how I read that article:
We are closing down shop immediately. Don't give us money - we don't want it. We don't want any of your money or business. Do not make trades with us. We are shutting down our trading engine on March 20, 2015. If you have money with us after March 25, you have complicated things for both of us. Get in line with everyone else that complicated things. 
{If we told you that you didn't maintain 100% of our reserves, it would be a shit storm. It'll be easier for Cavirtex to tell you we're all good - otherwise, shit storm}.
