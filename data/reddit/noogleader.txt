Says the guy stealing the goods and getting mad when he is asked to pay for them.
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:28:48
Yes that is what he is saying. Infrastructure brings stability and wealth long term to the people. Most infrastructure spending(or Bonds/Loans) are paid  back through taxation.  To not pay back these bonds and to leave it as debt is theft. These bonds are peoples wages, material cost and outside cost necessary to produce the needed project.
Essentially you intend to steal the benefit without paying the cost for it or theft.
This may go against your libitarian thought process but I see libertarians as theives not willing to pay for the goods they are using and ruining.

If your represented in government by an elected official it taxation isn't forced.
\&gt;&gt;They could voluntarily make whatever agreements about poaching they find agreeable and anyone who used their land would be required to abide by those agreements or they wouldn't be allowed on the property.
This simply doesn't work. poachers gonna poach. they already are operating outside of any good faith and the beleif that a peice of paper or agreement is going to stop poaching without enforcement for leverage is simply niave. No one can prevent 100 percent illigal passage onto their property.

In other words. We don't want to compensate you appropriately for your time but we will take a 6 digit raise for ourselves for all your hard work.

Or they could retroactively adjust all wages going pack to 1970-75 and adjust to inflation. In other words pay people so they can keep the same buying power today, tomorrow and the next day.

How do you increase the amount of coins without mining them?
Hate to break it to you but they are not making new coins. What is happening is they promise you coins and when a new group of "investors" (Marks in my book)comes and buys in they pay you out. This is ultimately unsustainable.

If the pizza gets larger at the same time as we divide it into smaller fractions what does that do? Or if the pizza shrinks... ? The reason I ask is that is the situation bitcoin has.. it's price is not fixed and so it can go up and down in price just like we can make a pizza bigger or smaller then divide it into smaller fractions.
If Bitcoin became $1 mil a coin That would make 0.000001 of a Bitcoin equal a $1 US and we still have two more decimal places to go. Assuming all 21 million bitcoins are still around(i understand some are unavailable to use)in some form by then the bitcoins could cover the entire function of the current global finacial market and then some.

I buy a spread of multiple currencies to reduce risk. Etherium, Litecoin, Ripple. 
Bitcoin though is what I started with. I bought some when I was in college when they were cheap(about a Nickle a piece). 20 dollars and just about 400 bitcoin. I spent a few of them passing them between friends and stored the rest of my wallet on an old thumb drive. I am glad I never threw that thumb drive away because I had over $456,000 on it. 
I got on here awhile back because I wanted to be able to convert them into cash which I thank everybody who gave good advice because I now can get cash out whenever I need it. 
I got it into my head though that just like stocks it might pay to diversify to take advantage of lows and highs and to lower overall risk. 
It might not be helpful but maybe you could look into alternative coins that are priced lower to buy in. You still get similar results to bitcoin and when you want to buy bitcoin you can sell them and buy up the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:12:23
This is spoofing done poorly. You are sopposed to cancel the buy before it completes not buy then sell immediately. The goal is to make it appear like there is ton of demand to artificially increase the price temporarily.

Actually the only thing that backs any currency(this includes debt) or commodity such as gold is subjective or a better way to put it our collective made up value we put  upon it. 
It isn't like we can go out and say that one turkey is equal to two hens without agreeing first that one hen is worth a half of one turkey can we. All parties involved must agree upon the value in order to properly make a trade. The trade is an agreement of value and is this not umchangable. I could argu my hens are superior to other hens and are worth at least 1 whole turkey a piece and that would if i could get someone to fall for it change the subjective value of my hens. In the same way we can change the value of the Turkey. Now replace Turkey with Debt and Hens for Currency. All these items have value only because we collectively say they do.

That only works if the merchant also buys things in btc and doesn't convert back to fiat.

The vendor doesn't buy things in btc yet, nor does he pay his employees in btc, nor does he pay his bills in btc. What the vendor does is sell those btc to get fiat. You hurt bitcoin.
