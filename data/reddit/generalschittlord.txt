uhhhh, thanks. was curious about that.
i did mean STARKs, not SNARKs.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:49:51
STARKs are much more efficient than SNARKs.

money moves between alts/BTC. it’s a cycle.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:44:10
XMR attempts to hide TX via obfuscation. zcash accomplishes this with encryption. ZEC’s the only alt network whose privacy is mathematically provable. monero is garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:53:54

works fine for me. you’re not being forced to use BTC.

what is this ceiling you speak of?

@_date: 2017-12-08 11:10:12
depends on what country you’re in, and what you want to trade.
side note: if you want to make money with alts; should find one you really like, hold for a minute, and support it. constantly switching between them will most likely end badly for you.

1. “holds no value” global market disagrees (that’s why it takes $16,000+ to buy 1 BTC)
2. if the federal government could kill BTC; would’ve already done it.
b) federal government doesn’t need a cumbersome block chain to issue currency.
3. we’re already outcompeting them, and exchange-rate reflects this fact. CME, CBOE, NASDAQ, NYSE are joining in, this basically means it’s game over for shut-down threats from USG.

@_date: 2019-03-08 16:15:53
imo, futures have a negligible effect on bitcoin. mostly because bitcoin’s “production” is guaranteed, and no outside forces can do anything about it. gold can be suppressed via futures since gold production can be controlled. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:27:33
with currencies like zcash/monero you most likely will need to go through an exchange that performs KYC. being said, once you take your ZEC/XMR off an exchange - the exchange doesn’t know what you’re doing with said currency. very much like how your bank performed KYC on you, but doesn’t know what you spend your cash on when you pull cash out of the ATM.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:05:57

1) scarcity's an illusion: untrue! bitcoin's block chain is most secure. very difficult (possibly impossible) to replicate.
2) all markets on the planet are manipulated via whales. no exceptions .. example: goldman got fined for manipulating the aluminum market not too long ago.
3) bitcoin's value is derived from a free market.
4) altcoins are tools. some will stick around because they come in handy.. but BTC is the standard

he's somewhat correct - BTC more closely resembles money, not currency. people get confused since BTC has enough characteristics of a currency that it passes. suppose BTC would become an actual currency once fair market value's established.. but that could be $5,000, or $1,000,000..

for a true bubble; needs an exponential rise; almost immediately followed by an exponential fall... BTC retested support; has been slowly accumulating; forcing an upward trend..back to bubbles.. on a chart a bubble would look like an inverted V, not a plateau. if we were in a bubble; would've been a few weeks ago. the term bubble is dumb also.. are we only describing normal market cycles, or what.. because that's what BTC just went through.. we're currently accumulating

pro tip: whatever altcoins are most suggestioned - prolly should avoid! those are baghodlers/crumbsnatchers trying to sell you their bags.
off the top-of-my head; here's how to do rough research an alt network. 
1) does this alt network do something BTC can't, or won't do?
2) can it be used as a tool to improve your BTC experience (fungiblity, etc)
3) volume - avoid illiquid coins (must be top 20 at least)

“tied to quite a centralized system”
this is a highly subjective statement. decentralization is a buzzword. censorship resistance is the important metric.
“would worry that the miners/whales/devs might face more pressure to form ties to other corps/govs as bitcoin gains popularity”
basically answered your own question here:
“significant proportion of bitcoin is currently owned by a minority of people who are either anonymous or not well-known to the general public”

vast majority of alt investors convert their BTC to alts, and vise-versa (not dollars).
you’re trading your alt vs BTC, so BTC-alt rates are most important, because most investors are looking to return to BTC when selling their alts. due to the fact when you buy an alt you’re (basically) short both USD, and BTC; it’s good to track both, but most legitimate alts will out perform USD.
if you originally bought your alt for USD, then BTC doesn’t matter as much, but still matters.

compartmentalize: 
1) pay cash for BTC.
2) never mix cash bought BTC with exchange bought BTC.
3) use exchange bought BTC to buy stuff.
4) don't share an address with anybody you don't trust (cash bought)
in-other-words: treat your cash bought BTC like money you've buried deep in the woods.
can go on, but that's the simple basics...

i'd say it's possible.
it's really no different than saying "unlikely".
here's what you need to know:
the plan's to make IMF's SDR the global currency.. SDR is a USD weighted basket of currencies. BTC is basically an automated SDR, but deflationary. BTC already beats SDR exchange rates, so one could make an argument BTC might become the global currency!

best way to learn's by making mistakes! unfortunately, trading's a dark art. learn how support, resistance, and ranges work from a technical angle. brush-up on your fundamentals.. you should hone your game theory skills, and study behavioral economics. game theory; when utilized in conjunction with behavioral economics is the foundation of fundamental analysis..     
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:45:22

pro tip: apex fundamental traders know what a market's going to do; long before any T/A dependent trader. fundamental trading in the most basic sense combines behavioral economics with game theory.
T/A waits for charts to confirm what fundamental traders already know!

side note: gold will be brutally punished.

(assuming USD) when you buy bitcoin via USD; you're making a bet BTC will rise in value against USD (like USD - gold). so, now you're vested in BTC (long). to buy an alt is not too different.
you take BTC, and convert to an altcoin.. you're now expecting the alt to rise in value against BTC.

we used to straight-up give BTC away on twitter, and other places.. you read that correctly lol
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:28:17
people say that because they keep their $ in BTC; rather-than a bank (been a great idea).. people usually only convert their BTC into fiat if they cannot pay in BTC. so, they only keep the amounts of $$ they need to operate in fiat world in accounts that can be seized (usually small amounts).

bitcoin's not fungible enough! if strangers can identify you; terrible for coin control. might not seem like an issue now, but when BTC hits the $4-5,000 range; you'll be a major target. think of yourself as a bank without the bank's security. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:21:38
depends on what you want to do with it.. if you want to trade; keep BTC on an exchange.
if you want to hodl for a while; put BTC in cold storage.
if you're planning on buying stuff; use an off exchange wallet like purse io, or something like it (i'm a hodler wouldn't know which is best)
