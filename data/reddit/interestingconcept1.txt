Why do you say that?  Player levels?  Obviously will take time to get back to those levels.

Even the absolute largest poker sites (Pokerstars, etc.) do not have this functionality.  This would require an absolutely insane amount of work, and I don't think its fair to ask this of a site that is being run by such a small team.  Certainly would like it as well, but just dont think its fair to demand this out of such a small operation.
Also I am not sure even most players would want it as I think it would allow you to see everyone's dealt cards?  Many players would prefer to not have as it puts players that play a lot of hands at a HUGE disadvantage.  Allowing players to change names to relieve this introduces new problems, collusion easier, etc.
Overall it really is truly very tough to make a really good, secure, safe poker site.  Demanding this type of functionality out of a very small run poker site is simply unfair IMHO.

Very interesting.  But would this allow each player to know the initially dealt cards to each other player?  If so, is there a way to do it so that each player CANNOT know the other players' cards?  The issue I see that, although the deck is provably fair, this allows other people to heavily datamine each player, which is FAR worse IMHO.
Also do you agree it would take a long time to develop a poker client using this method?

You can't detect the phone call.  But you can detect the irregularities in play as a result of it.  Same 2 people always playing together, etc.
