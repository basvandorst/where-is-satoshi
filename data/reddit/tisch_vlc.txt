Okay, thanks :)
The numbers were just approximate but I guess the point stands.

Maybe that wasn't a good choice of word, what I really wanna know is if investing a really low amount could translate in earning something like 20€/month.

D... Dad?
Jokes apart, What do you mean by filling out surveys?
And thanks a lot for the insight, I guess my idea wasn't as good as I though! :)

Thanks for the numbers, that way I can almost objectively see how it's a bad idea to try it!

Okay, thanks. I'll give it a try :)

Hey! This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this.
I have a very low income and every cent counts. I had the idea of investing a really low amount (&gt;30€) in a crypto currency and withdraw something like 5€/week, is this feasible? I have no interest in risking a lot of money for a chance at winning a lot or becoming rich, just a ~~low and steady~~ extra source of ~~capital~~ money.
Edit: a friend of mine is really interested in the topic and thus I understand the basics of it, but he's obsessed with becoming rich (he also doesn't have financial problems like me) and I cba to ask him for advice lol.

Well I wouldn't mind having an extra "job" to earn money sitting in front of my PC..

You're browsing reddit, should I tell you how to spend your time? Jesus fuck people are sometimes so dumb. Also, you know nothing about me and I didn't ask how to improve my formation. Go back to life and learn it's basics.
Tell me how successful your life was/is 39 y/o redditor.
