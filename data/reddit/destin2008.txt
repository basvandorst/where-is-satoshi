$7600 Is this a new BTC price?
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:53:02
I believe here is your answer:Mentioned already on another btc sub,  a quote from the Forbes article:"Once Bakkt has tons of digital tokens stored in its “warehouse, institutional investors can trade all day without having to report transactions to the blockchain".

 Nano better than bitcoin, copper better than gold.  
Aluminium wedding ring is the way to go.

BTC 24H low is $7866 and dropping
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:17:14
I like your comments, you seem knowledgeable and calm about it
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:39:20
Asides diversification,  
One, $1 ALTcoin needs to go 400&amp; to bring $5.  
But then one BTC only needs to go up 0,0001&amp; to make extra $6.  
In other words, you will still need thousands of ALTcoins to gain same profit.  
Besides, you don't have to own 1 full BTC to enter the market.   
All you need is a fraction of it to start trading :D.

BTC 24H low is $7730
Is it about time to BUY?
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:53:10


 And what &amp; of the world use to use PC or mobile phones 30 years ago? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:53:04


Yep, more like 5 days ago
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:11:29
I did too, but I meant to hold until it hits over 20K  :D  
I figured  6,400 or 7,400 makes no difference..
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:55:21
BTC 24H low is $7657 
Is it now best time to BUY?
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:12:10
Good Lord, you are brave!
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:36:34
That would be great, I wish good luck to all of us :D 
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:09:15
I bought &lt;6K on last drop.
If it droops below 7400, would it make sense to sell and repurchase at ATL?
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:14:56
I am good either way.   
Would be nice to load some more on the downward
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:20:26
hope for it , then I can buy me some more btc
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:55:00
Crossed my mind , except  I am 60% down with all the ALTs and would be nice to get some back.
If I knew better, I would never trade BTC for some coins I am stuck with.
