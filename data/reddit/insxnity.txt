How fucking stupid are you lol
12 hours != 28 minutes.
My top posts had 0/negative votes for the 30 minutes. 
Both of these subs are nothing but people jerking themselves off and yelling about how bad the other one is lmao

There was a post here where a guy asked how to sell and got death threats in his PM's. Reddit is an overall terrible place to go for anything related to bitcoin, B¢Ḩ, or the whole lot of it.

Lol have you seen the people in this thread? Highly upvoted comments under the top saying that if you don’t believe you should not sell you’re an idiot. A guy bought in at 20k coz y’all were saying BUY NOW OR U MAKE NO MUNEEZ and it dropped to 11k days afterwards, and now he’s an idiot for wanting to sell after losing half of his money with no guarantee of keeping the rest. Makes sense.

Without accusing me of being a BCash Shill (I only own doge, don't worry), would you mind explaining why it's worse or any different than BTC? All I hear in regards to other coins (especially BCH) is that they suck and btc is god

But the politics are retarded. It’s two groups of people concerned about vastly different issues who spend less time concerned about the technological aspects of a technological currency and more about how the fictional “other side” is a bunch of brainwashed shills

They need to fix TX fees and times before this becomes more commonplace

If it's a brain wallet, you'd need about $72 [source](

1. All currencies other than bitcoin are just copying us right fellow hodlers? its not like the community here only promotes positive news about bitcoin because they own it and make money if people continue to buy it. ^^heil ^^bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:08:56
Because you’re being misinformed by people with an investment in bitcoin so you’ll buy more and drive the price up. 
People would buy BCH because it’s a better currency, but the people here don’t want you to know that
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:12:56
It’s almost like the people here have an investment in it or something 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:52:18
That’d work, probably. You need to transfer it to an out of Canada account, have them withdrawal, and shoot the cash to you. 
Also take a look at paxful if coinbase let’s you send to other wallets 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:07:31
I have more money in BTC than BCH, but it’s not hard to see that BCH has obvious advantages that BTC simply fails to address, even if they’re minor, such as insane miner fees and clogged mempools
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:51:45
M0ds own BTC too...
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:14:36
everything is a conspiracy against bitcoin dont you know?

Get your news from people who dont depend on you buying their product for their success. You don't listen to car salesmen to figure out what car you're going to buy, because they want you to get what's most profitable for them. You listen to 3rd parties. Check tech news sites, learn the facts for yourself, watch the graph itself, and stay out of reddit for news

as someone invested in neither you’re both retards arguing over which internet coin is better

Can't find one on Reddit mobile

I can’t believe this sub finally became aware that yelling HODL and telling everyone to buy as it rose to 20k might have been a bit of a mistake 
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:07:15
Another stupid question, when the computer is solving these "riddles", are they actually just random complicated math, or is it essential to the mining process?
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:25:30
We all started having no idea how it worked or what it's use was. It's a hard concept to wrap your head around at first, because there's not much to compare it to

Best time to buy it was then. Second best time to buy it is righ now

For those of you who were curious like me:
100,000 bolivars = ~$52
Their largest bill, a 100 bolivar note, is worth about 5 cents.

Kind of newb here, if bitcoin is produced like that, and halves every so often, who controls this, how do we know it happens, and how could we prevent someone producing more bitcoins on a large scale?
