Welcome. I think Bitcoin is a fantastically asymmetric bet, and for a noob, Coinbase is a good way to buy.
That said, I would strongly recomment NOT being a noob  before you invest a "good part" of your savings. Buy some, play around, really dive into it and increase your experience &amp; understanding before making a non-trivial financial committment.

Yes. Segwit elegantly deals with a number of issues that are important to eventually resolve, but a credible solution for scaling without running into artificial fee pressure is not one of them.
Also, we should understand that, soft fork or not, segwit is a big change to the ecosystem as a whole. It fundamentally revises the blockchain datastructure, introduces a totally new class of nodes between today's "full nodes" and "spv clients", and it creates a situation where products and services that don't re-code at a pretty basic level will no longer necessarily understand the full intended meaning of all transactions.
Again, from a computer science standpoint (my background), it's elegant and should ultimately be done for various reasons, but from a practical standpoint, it's a huge change for the ecosystem, and also does not credibly address the most important issue at hand today: scaling tx throughput without eliminating bitcoin's current free-market tx economics.

Very much disagree. If Bitcoin expands, Casascius coins suddenly get on the radar of traditional numismatists. They are very much not at all known outside of Bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:05:28
That's making the probably false assumption that nodes and miners implement zero soft safeguards. In the absence of a pre-set hard consensus blocksize, I'd certainly implement some sanity checking in both my mining code and my block-relaying code.
And that's just it... It's best to leave to the market what *can* be left to the market, since a free-market will almost always develop far more optimal solutions than some central planner could've. Only if there's overwhelming empirical evidence to suggest that the free-market can't handle some problem should other solutions be considered.
@_date: 2015-12-30 05:10:54


Me too. I'm getting to the "screw it, let's fork 'em" point, as are a lot of people. I'm personally less and less willing to compromise on some solution that doesn't credibly retain the free-market for blockspace. I don't want to re-live this fight in 6 months or 2 years or whatever. This has been horrible enough as is, so let's fix it now to keep bitcoin's free-market ethos forever.
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:01:39
Some argue that since this means miners individually select blocksize, there'd be chaos on the network as miners create blocks which may or may not get rejected by other miners. Personally, I think that argument is quite thin and naive, as it totally ignores the extremely powerful economic incentives for miners to communicate to each other what blocks they'll accept and what they won't. If you had 25BTC riding on this, you'd probably make sure in a hurry that you're producing a block that others will mine on top of. 
That communication incentive is also an example of the free-market working. A limited blocksize fundamentally assumes that free markets don't work.

Bought my first coins in the rubble of that first Goxing. The fact that BTC rebounded pretty quickly to &gt;$14 and stayed there for a bit was indicative that such a fledgling currency had some meaningful community support behind it.
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:41:23
Yes, obviously run of the mill uninteresting gold coins go for small premia; my whole point was that many Casascius issues engender many of the key things that can make a coin go for extreme premiums (where premium in this case is multiple of underlying btc, analogous to multiple of gold/silver spot for PM coins).
I would not say that about any if the other later physical bitcoins (Titan, etc). While often nice coins, they just don't have the history.
And there are indeed a number of historical coins that go for six or seven figures (100x+ spot). Some Casascius coins have the lineage to *potentially* be such key coins decades from now.
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:00:46


I think that's due to a measurement change in what "counts" as a full node. My understanding is that the ~6000 node count now only consists of nodes that allow incoming connections; eg, have opened up port-8333 on their firewalls. By contrast, the older 5 and 6 figure numbers also count client-only bitcoind/qt instances.

Yes, they should. I think Jeff Garzik did a great job of providing some structure to what "scaling" should mean, at least in the near/medium term, namely - avoiding a "Fee Event" where blockspace becomes artificially scarce and fees rise. Given that understanding, Core's timeline here is acutely lacking as it does nothing to credibly handle that issue. Unfortunately keeping bitcoin transactions cheap for as long as possible does not seem to be a priority of Core's.
Note that if segwit were implemented on main-net tomorrow, and we got one of bitcoin's characteristic adoption waves where nearly every metric goes up 10x in a month, we'd hit the blockspace wall regardless of segwit.
There's certainly a lot to like about segwit, long-term, but let's not confuse it with real near-term scaling.

Satoshi, 2008: 
Satoshi quotes aside, *any* proof of work system that's successful will ultimately result in hashers competing on electricity cost for pure hash production. This is effectively the definition of an efficient free-market. This is a huge success, not a failure.
While it's therefore inevitable that mining industrializes to some extent, it's obviously critical that bitcoin retains its essence as a decentralized system, which means that there must be *enough* unique miners that no single entity or group can coerce the system. "Enough" is clearly subjective, but there are a few things that make obviously catastrophic centralization unlikely:
1) It's not just about the raw cost of producing the commodity (hashes) itself. At a certain point, the margins on raw hash-production will be razor thin, and so miners will likely have to compete on higher order services (processing "non-standard" txns, geographic issues, ui/ux, etc). Thus being the absolute lowest-energy-cost producer matters a lot less.
2) Also don't forget that pools are just collections of individual largely independent small miners (and 21.co should amplify this). As long as switching costs from one pool to another are small, this is fine. If a pool were to abuse their position, component miners would switch. It's a one-line pool-config change right now, which is indeed sufficiently low-friction. Remember the GHash.io scare of 2014? What's GHash's position now? For any non-old-timers reading, this also happened in 2013 with BTC Guild, and in 2011 with DeepBit. The market sorted it out naturally every time.
3) There is no such thing as a natural monopoly: 
tldr: Free markets really do work. Let Bitcoin be as free a market as possible.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:08:17
Used to think that. But remember Professor Bitcorn, for example? When June 2014 came to a close, and people called him on his terrible prediction/statements, he just said something to the effect of "well, I'm still right, I was just wrong on the timing". And only those of us that care about Bitcoin remember at all. Never mind the fact that his original statements belie so much mis-understanding of econ/finance/tech in general, *and* he was resoundingly proven wrong empirically - he's still a respected professor at Boston College and endured essentially zero flak for his aggressively wrong statements from anywhere except deep in the bitcoin community.
The problem is that the negative public statements *do* negatively influence the progress of Bitcoin in the short-term, and there really aren't any consequences for incorrect hostile/negative statements on any timescale, even once they're *proven* wrong.

Fair points, in general, and certainly the right perspective to have for people who've had little exposure to Bitcoin but are hostile. After all, most of us thought it wouldn't work at first glance, right?
In Blythe's case, though, she's obviously thought quite a bit about Bitcoin and decentralized tech, and has at this point thoroughly intellectually rejected it. 
But I do agree that it's generally not productive to "vilify", especially not easily, and that people can change.

I think the correct sentiment is roughly: "Everything that *can* be left to the free-market, should be." If you take transparency as a fundamental design goal of bitcoin, then it follows that money-supply is one of the things that probably needs to be well-defined up front.
But the minutia of the economic system, which includes things like fees, blocksize, tx-throughput, how many inputs a tx can have an expect to get relayed, etc, can and should be left to market participants unless there's overwhelming empirical evidence to suggest that for some reason the free-market is broken in some context. 
I personally think that pure free-market breaks are pretty rare. Believing that we need a blocksize limit explicitly to create fee-pressure is a fundamental rejection of free-market efficiency.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:20:22
Indeed - we should let bitcoin scale as much as possible early in its life. Cheap, fast, global transacitons is a pretty good way to generate interest and adoption, and make bitcoin something that's important to people and economically relevant. Without that interest and real economic importance, bitcoin's likelihood of becoming something of global relevance, that can materially enhance freedom around the world, becomes a lot less likely.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:52:13
Yeah, a tiny blocksize that encourages high fees while bitcoin is young may strangle the baby in the cradle, allowing the demand for cheap, fast, global cash to be filled by something else for a while. Especially insidious is that if this happens, the idea that a crypto-coin can hold value long-term will have been successfully attacked, which will hold back the whole idea of crypto store-of-value.
*Eventually* a pure uncensorable public cryptocoin should gain considerable market-cap, but hindering  cheap tx throughput early reduces the likelihood that it's Bitcoin. And if it's not Bitcoin, it's going to take a long time for it to be something else.

[Here's a link]( to the bitcointalk thread with an excerpt of what you wrote since your original press release is [throwing a 500](
As you can probably tell, it still pisses me off that you threw Bitcoin under the bus like that (on top of losing 550,000BTC one way or another).
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:04:01
Indeed. 
I have to say, a few months ago, I probably would've accepted something less than BIP101, but now I think this whole affair has exposed an even more serious problem than strictly the blocksize issue: Core dev does not appreciate free-market economics, nor the demands/needs of the user base. That *must* change. If they propose an immediate 2/4/8, that's not sufficient as it's now clear that the core (haha) problem is a fundamental mis-alignment between Core dev and the community. I don't think that's going to change via a temporary compromise on blocksize. 
Furthermore, on the local issue of blocksize itself, enough damage has been done to the community already with this public and acrimonious debate that we might as well get it over with once and for all at this point. We need to keep blocksize significantly above the free-market equilibrium, as has been the case for bitcoin's entire history. Eventually the free-market will price txn fees to balance dropping coinbase rewards, orphan risk, and tx demand. Any solution that doesn't credibly let the free-market do that is unacceptable and is an affront to why we're all here using and developing the world's first electronic user-driven free-market currency/asset. I don't want to have this fight again, and bitcoin is beginning to gain real global relevance and mindshare *now*.

And, again, if this becomes a significant enough problem that it truly threatens bitcoin's core ethos - ie, the reasons users find utility in bitcoin - the free-market will develop a solution. Maybe miners pay node operators for priority notification of transactions and blocks... (IIRC dealt with this here:  )
Or maybe it's something else - the point is, I don't know, I'm just one person. But I'll leave the market to work it out rather than dictate something.....unless and until there's overwhelming empirical data to suggest that the free-market is somehow fundamentally broken.

That statement is pretty much always true for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:18:29
Three questions:
1) Do you think there should be a free-market for blockspace, where miners decide how many transactions to include in each block, and what fees they'll accept? 
2) Do you think Bitcoin requires any individual to be able to run a fully-validating node on cheap hardware in order for the system to retain its key essence of a non-centrally-controlled currency? Or do you think that the network consolidating somewhat with "server farms of specialized hardware" (to borrow a satoshi [quote]( ) would still be ok?
3) Do you think there'd be support for a mining pool that's transparently run (in the US or EU) as a non-profit, with the explicit goal of increasing bitcoin adoption and giving users a voice, via hashpower, in the bitcoin protocol's development?
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:09:25


IIRC, the analysis of the nonce distribution which led to the conclusions about a single farm (presumably satoshi's) doing most of the mining in 2009 indicated that it was a few dozen machines (&lt;50), probably somewhat ordinary machines individually. 
Regarding the gentleman's agreement... Do we know how many coins artforz mined in the end?
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:48:25
I think the point is more that there should be a free-market for blockspace, and that devs shouldn't intentionally hinder certain uses of blockspace in favor of others; let the market figure it out.

Look at premiums on gold coins vs the underlying gold value. They can be well over 100x. Numismatics (coin collecting) is really about the history, rarity, beauty, and meaning of the piece.
And no other physical item so perfectly tracks bitcoin's path; Casascius coins are the first to exist, to prove the concept initially as a means just to spread awareness of bitcoin in general (hence why many of the 2011/12 pieces are dirty - they were in our pockets every day), always extremely limited production, with the "mint" eventually getting shutdown due to ridiculous regulatory overreach from FinCEN. 
That kind of history is what makes a *key* piece for collectors in thr longrun.
If Bitcoin becomes what we think it can become, I think these coins can see extreme premuims in the longrun, even at extreme bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:41:31
The unexpected emergency fork of March 2013 was resolved in a matter of hours because there's huge economic incentive for ppl to get on the longest chain as quickly as possible. Bitcoin fundamentally relies on economic incentives, and actors responding rationally to them. This is possibly the key fact that core dev doesn't fully appreciate, leading them to think they have to centrally engineer complex economics into the code directly instead of letting the free market work its magic.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:42:49
Soft fork or not, a fundamental reorg of the blockchain data-structure which creates a new class of a sorta full-nodes, and obscures transaction meaning from old clients.....is hardly "safe" in practice. 
In the strict academic sense of maintaining a single longest uncontested chain, yeah, it's "safe". In the practical sense, it's a *huge* change for the ecosystem that's going to necessitate tons of dev hours across hundreds of products/services to fully deal with.
Granted, it's a more elegant data-structure and solves a number of issues that we should put on the roadmap and ultimately solve, but framing SW as a "safe" nearterm deployment that's a "solution" to scaling is disingenuous on two fronts.

Quoting fully for posterity:


Also, as of Feb 10, 2014, we only knew of transaction malleability through someone showing this could actually be exploited (publicly). We disabled bitcoin withdrawals, started searching for a solution (reached normalized txid), and at the same time re-checked all cold wallets. By the end of Feb. we found out that it was unlikely we had enough BTC (we did find some later, however) so we contacted the court and proceeded with civil rehabilitation from there.
I still believe normalized txid should be a thing, as it's the only way to keep track of whatever you sign and push on the network. There are efforts to make transactions immutable, but there is no guarantee there won't be a way to overcome that in the future.


Ok. Can you please provide a link or txid for the "1000 BTC event"? ("Blockchain or it didn't happen," right?)...

The point is that because it's so volatile, it's probably best to do your own fundamentals analysis, and then just fiat-cost-average in while the price is below what you think is "fair value".

No, it is not better to work with Western Union. They won't be looking for the truly best way to do things, exactly because of the huge legacy infrastructure (physical stores/booths, corporate headcount, etc) that they maintain. Consciously or not, every decision they make will have an underlying self-preservation motivation. It's not easy to cannibalize your own business, no matter how obvious the sea-change is. Blockbuster and Kodak couldn't do it.
Essentially, Western Union can be replaced with bitcoin ATMs. WU likes to cite regulatory compliance, but there's no reason robust KYC can't be done by an ATM.

Obviously a lot of the 2009 coins are likely to be Satoshi's, but half or more of the total are probably early miners, many of whom probably just ran bitcoin-qt as a curiosity for a few hours or days (mining several to dozens of blocks in the process) and then shut it off.

Some of the most rare can sell for 20x face value or more (specifically, the Series-2 0.5BTC 2013 Silver variety). But most of 2013 brass coins sell between 1.5-2.0x face value. The silver coins sell for a greater multiple.

Very nice. More data (eg, funding position, funding siblings, etc):   
  
Personally, I think Casascius coins have a good shot at being fantastic collectors' items years/decades from now if the bitcoin ledger is still around (and possibly even if it's not). There are other physical bitcoins (and alts) around now, obviously, but none are tied to the ascendance of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general like Casascius coins are. As far as collectibles go, the story and history often matter more than even strict rarity, and Casascius coins uniquely have both.

Indeed. Now let's remember what Satoshi said about lifting the 1mb blocksize cap 4 years ago:
  
  










  
  
Note that if you read more of Satoshi's writings, you'll see that he considered micropayments (which are only possible with small tx-fees) to be a very important use-case for bitcoin.
tldr; I agree with Satoshi on this - the blocksize limit needs to be increased.

Thanks for the answer. Unfortunately I'm a little disappointed with this view. I've followed your involvement with the bitcoin community since one of your first posts on bitcointalk, and have generally been happy with your involvement in the community.
However, encouraging alt-coins is problematic. Decentralizing everything is great. Decentralizing everything with a new blockchain and new native unit is not. Whenever an engineering decision has to be made about introducing a new token, it should only be done as a last resort. 
Perhaps the most important thing blockchain tech can bring to the world is better money (this should resonate with your strong limited-gov views), and by encouraging an array of dilutive me-too crypto-currencies, the adoption of any single strong crypto-currency at all is hindered. Without the strong single store-of-value, bitcoin's political influence will be minimal.

It wouldn't change my opinion of bitcoin at all. The code is open-source. Who initially wrote it doesn't matter. What matters is how well the tech works, what properties it has, and how it evolves from here. 
Once people fully understand that it doesn't matter if Satoshi is Nick Szabo, an NSA employee, or Ben Bernanke, they are on the path to actually understanding bitcoin.

I've considered that point, and obviously I cannot with certainty say that's not the case without selling all my coins.
But my thinking (while admittedly being a hodler), is that it's best for the idea of crypto-scarcity at all that *bitcoin* obtains and retains significant value quickly. If another coin were to surpass bitcoin (which I think the door opens up to for the first time in bitcoin's history if it becomes expense/high-friction to use), then the argument that a cryptographic asset can't be scarce (because of alt-coins) becomes a much more reasonable theory.
That's not to say that something wouldn't *eventually* become a long-run high-value stable crypto-asset, but I think bitcoin being overtaken would introduce enough doubt into crypto-scarcity that it would set back the entire ecosystem significantly.

Agree that Bitcoin will evolve. I'd caveat that with an assertion that the core state of the ledger will persist through the evolutionary process. Sidechains effectively offer that exact goal. 
   
   


  
Yes and no. Centralized services may indeed change faster, but their changes do not necessarily stick or create meaningful network effect. With open protocols, myriad 3rd parties have integrated the protocol into their services, and there's generally very strong incentive to evolve these protocols in a compatible way. Switching to something new is just a huge pain. That may result in slower evolution, but it's probably stronger in terms of adoption, at least for protocols that get past a certain threshold of adoption.

In my experience, retail merchants only require a few second wait. Remember that what one or more full confirmations give the merchant is transaction security; ie, assurance that the coins you gave him are indeed considered his by the whole network, and that you can't go spend them again somewhere else.  
  
But double-spending isn't easy, and coffee is cheap. Furthermore, transactions generally reach &gt;90% of nodes within a few seconds of initial broadcast, so even if you *did* walk out the door and then try a double-spend, most miners would just eject the 2nd transaction from their mempools (queue of transactions waiting to make it into the next block) because they already see a transaction spending those coins from a few seconds earlier. This sort of "how many nodes know about this trans" analysis is what Bitpay and Coinbase likely do in order to consider a 0-conf trans low-risk.  
  
Furthermore, newer services like Blockcypher are trying to standardize that analysis and process/API so that 0-conf acceptance really becomes on a non-issue for most "normal" sorts of purchases.

Yes, main-chain (in a permissionless system) will probably always require some non-trivial consensus time for assurance against irreversibility; 'tis the nature of practical byzantine consensus. 
But it does not have to be expensive to transact. There are plenty of success-case equilibria of bitcoin's price, hashpower, and tx-vol that yield fees in the pennies per tx. Those are the longrun equilibria we should be striving for, not some fantasy situation where bitcoin main-chain transactions get very expensive, yet magically bitcoin still wins.

I became interested in Bitcoin because of a [white-paper]( titled: 
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
In the first paragraph, the author discusses how a major motivation of the system is to bring down the "minimum practical transaction size" and to enable "small casual transactions" electronically. The key to achieving these goals is to make transactions truly irreversible (so there's no mediation cost), and the only way to credibly do that, is to make the system such that no one entity controls it. 
It's clear that reducing the cost of electronic transactions is a design goal, if not *the* design goal, from which various other features (irreversibility, decentralization, uncensorability) follow in order to meet the goal(s).
It's a good read. You should check it out.

And in 2012, only $2m in VC money was raised by Bitcoin companies. It's easy to forget just how much the ecosystem has expanded in only 2 years.
@_date: 2016-01-04 05:33:36
Two things:
1) Wallets no longer require running a node.
2) We don't conclusively have node counts from years past.
Expanding on each point:
1) The only decent wallet you could run used to be the Satoshi client. This was before you popped up on bitcointalk, here, or twitter, so I assume you're unfamiliar with how the ecosystem used to look. 
Obviously a lot has developed over the years. Web wallets of all sorts, SPV clients, etc. People no longer have to run a node in order to have a wallet. That's the gist of it.
2) Some of the data points thrown around are for *all* nodes, regardless of whether they were "full" nodes, as defined by being an accessible relay node on port-8333. That stuff is *now* tracked pretty well by bitnodes and others, but it wasn't before, and the numbers are often confused and unspecific with regard to whether full-node client software that *wasn't* relaying was included (which is *not* a "full-node" by modern terminology).  
One specific data-point we *do* have, though, is from [Dan Kiminsky's 2011 talk at Black Hat]( where he notes (slide 29):


^ where "active inbound set" means clients accessible for *inbound* traffic on port-8333
For reference, Bitnodes currently reports ~5500 full-nodes. Consider the overwhelming dynamic is probably  above, it's not unreasonable to conclude that the expanding userbase *has* significantly increased the number of people/companies willing to run full-nodes for purposes other than having a wallet.

I agree that they had their hands full, and that re-launching with hot-wallet multisig is great, but I still feel like Bitstamp missed an opportunity to show the power of the blockchain during this incident.  
  
They could've just signed a transaction with the cold-storage address's private key to assure everybody, beyond doubt, that the bulk of customer bitcoins are safe. That would've been a really cool demonstration and assurance to the community, and the media story would've been as much about that, than about the hack itself.

Some alt experimentation is good, yes, but that idea is overblown.  
  
We didn't learn much from any of the alt events you note. Those outcomes and dynamics were pretty much all obvious. Some of the current "Bitcoin 2.0" projects are more interesting, but we're talking about &lt;1% of total "alt" coins/projects total.  
  
Overall, alts are a net negative for the Bitcoin ecosystem. The alt-circus makes the whole idea of crypto-currency look like a joke, and also gives credence to the naysayers' credo that you can't have digital scarcity because of alt-coins. That holds back ecosystem development and investment in general. That notion will be overcome in time, but the ridiculous hype, scams, pumps, and absurd rhetoric surrounding alts doesn't help.

I didn't mean to imply any conspiracy theories. I believe that in the overwhelming majority of cases on both sides of the argument, people genuinely want what they think is best for bitcoin. This boils down to a difference of opinion over what tradeoffs are best to make at this point in time. 
Personally, I think it's most important to leave as much about bitcoin's dynamics to the free-market as possible. This means keeping the blocksize limit much higher than the average blocksize, such that the demand for blockspace by users is naturally balanced by the fees miners will accept for their services. Jeff Garzik treats this idea of keeping bitcoin's to-date free-market economics intact here: 
It seems clear to me that there's lots of headroom to raise blocksize-limit observing that Moore's/Nielsen's law works in our favor. Incidentally, Satoshi observed this too:


  
Note that Satoshi also realized that as a practical matter, bitcoin nodes would consolidate. That doesn't mean "centralized" so long as there are sufficient independently motivated node operators, and it remains affordable for anyone to access credible blockchain-state information. He also considered on-chain micropayments to be desirable, as he understood that getting bitcoin *used* by as many people as possible results in both the most technical and social security as possible. The more lives bitcoin touches, the more people are motivated to make it work and keep it valuable...and the less hostile governments and other actors can attack it.
That's the bitcoin I signed-up for 5 years ago - one that would be allowed to scale simply and rationally, where we understand the tradeoffs that need to be made, but without sacrificing the key points of scarcity, censorship resistence, and building a global p2p cash that's as frictionless (low fee) as possible. Those are the features that ultimately lead to both the highest market-cap possible, and the most global impact in terms of monetary freedom for humanity.

Read the whitepaper:  . First paragraph makes it clear that a major motivation for *creating* bitcoin is to reduce the cost of "small casual transactions" over an electronic medium. That is, to make *electronic cash* viable for the time.
Core may have strong and good ideals, but in my opinion, bitcoin needs to be good *money* (and to be clear, uncensorability and scarcity are key aspects of good money). 
To me, the vision Core has outlined is taking Bitcoin in a direction that reduces it's ability to be good money. Thus, I cannot support Core's vision, whatever the purity of the ideals held by the humans who maintain that client implementation.

The "logic" goes something to the effect of:
"If blockspace is not made artificially scarce, miners will include up to an infinite number of transactions per block; thereby depleting the blockspace resource and putting an undue burden on everyone else to store all the free transactions in their copies of the blockchain."
Yes, that argument totally ignores the obvious reality that miners have operational costs, and economically rational miners will not include transactions that cost them more to process (orphan risk, plus other per-tx ops cost) than they represent in fee revenue. The argument is a fantastic example of sky-is-falling narrow-minded linear thinking that's divorced from economic reality. And related, FWIW - if one does not believe that miners in net are going to be rational economic actors, then one cannot believe that bitcoin can possibly work. Yet that is the assumption small-blockists are effectively coming from, whether they realize/admit it or not.

We all know the rules are defined by the &gt;50%. Not the 100%. That's what I bought into 4.5yrs ago. If you bought into something else, then you miscalculated.


The most corrupt thing going on right now is manipulation of the conversation to suppress certain views.


Technically, but not economically! And that's a huge difference. You guys need to accept (and appreciate!!) that bitcoin will be defined by the economic majority (&gt;50%). You cannot stop it, and all you are doing by putting up this fight is causing unnecessary damage to something that I do believe you truly value, despite the fact that your actions are causing material damage.


If bitcoin can't show that it can continue to be what its users (hodler-weighted) want it to be, then it's clearly possible that a less-economically significant faction is capable of controlling it, which would be a horrible outcome, as that group is less likely to have the same economic motivations (eg, seeing bitcoin gain value). Thus I reach the opposite conclusion: the case for bitcoin as a long-term store of value *depends* on its ability to fork periodically, when users demand it, regardless of whether there's a sub-group in a prominent position of some sort that disagrees.
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:51:18
Fees *ultimately* need to pay for the network, yes. But make no mistake that bitcoin is in a race to become globally, economically important. It does represent a threat to government and large swaths of the status quo financial system. If it becomes seen as a legitimate threat *before* enough people/companies/institutions rely on it, govs, etc, can actually do a lot of damage. Cryptocurrency will be an important thing no matter what, but I'd rather get there as fast as possible with bitcoin.
In that light, there is much security in large "adoption" numbers. Yes, that probably entails it becoming impossible to run a fully-validating node on a 5yr old laptop, but I think that's a prudent tradeoff. Further toward the adoption end, I think it best to keep bitcoin as cheap to use as possible for as long as possible. This was my understanding when purchasing my first coins in 2011; it seemed a good plan then, and it still is. That vision is what I bought into. It is *absurd* that an anti-DoS hack tossed into the codebase as a temporary measure is now being used as an economic control/policy tool. In 2011/12, virtually no one would've thought this would happen. 
The thought then (as now for us "large blockers") was that miners must be net econo-rational for the system to work in the first place, so there's really no such thing as a block that's "too large". Miners will find a market-clearing equilibrium blocksize, both in terms of their own orphan risk vs the number of txns they include, and an understanding of what size blocks other miners will accept. I can see an argument for a "sanity-check" sort of blocksize limit, which is what the original 1MB limit was for years when block sizes were &lt;&lt;200kb, but I digress... 
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:46:47
The point is worth understanding... Bitcoin is a multidisciplinary project, of which economics and free-market incentives play a huge role. Adam was late to the Bitcoin party *because* he took a broken pessimistic view of Bitcoin's economic dynamics (essentially he didn't believe the incentives could work for long in practice). And the blocksize issue is showing us that that's where the expertise breaks down for many of the technically-talented core devs. 
Blocksize is *not* just a technical debate, it's mostly an economic one, and even a philosophical one (eg, do you "believe in" the ability of free-markets to come to natural solutions, or do you think these things need to explicitly econo-engineered at the code level?).

I think that video was shot in 2013. The transaction(s) over which Charlie pleaded guilty to "aiding and abetting an unlicensed money-transmitting business" actually occurred in early 2012, if memory serves.
It's worth noting that virtually nobody cared about bitcoin in early 2012; serious people considered it a toy at best. Also, Charlie made plenty of mistakes, but he didn't have SR "involvement" so to speak. His guilty plea was related to doing transactions with *another* MSB which in turn did business with SR vendors, as far I as recall from reading the indictment a while ago.

It's absurd that there are so many smart people who don't understand that bitcoin will inevitably be 'governed' by occasional nasty disagreements ultimately arbitrated by a hard fork, and that that's ok; a strength that ensures survival, even.

I understand the point, and agree things can be done to make the blockchain more efficient, that segwit suggests a more elegant blockchain structure that would be good to ultimately implement, etc...
But there *is* a more important economic/philosophical debate happening *now*; eg, should fees rise in the near-ish term to incentivize use of on-chain bitcoin txns to be primarily settlement use cases, or should we do everything we can, in the near-term, to keep fee-pressure at bay for as long as possible thereby allowing market-forces to determine use-cases &amp; solutions?
Pessimists and central-planners like the former; truly free-market oriented folks tend to prefer the latter.

It's a reasonable proposal to *actually* scale bitcoin, credibly, in the foreseeable future, without a lot of complication, and isn't just a can-kick that guarantees we'll have this ugly fight again soon.
While it's not quite a pure free-market play, in that it still leaves blocksize limit as a hard consensus rule, most of the time it probably will work out to a limit that's sufficiently higher than the free-market equilibrium such that there's no artificial fee pressure....which is why it's a good proposal.

As I recall, Adam didn't think the system's economic incentives would hold it together for long. That's a rational-enough position to take when thinking about investing; though it suggests that Adam analyzes bitcoin's fundamental reliance on the self-interest of the economic majority differently than those of us who bought our first coins in the single digits or less. 
We at least thought it *could* work, and wasn't doomed to a tragedy of the commons situation. Call it trust in the free-market, if you like, but it does more or less boil down to a belief in a set of economically motivated actors to act net econo-rationally....or not. If you believe in the power of the economic incentives, it seems unnecessary to build new economic-controls into the system (you know, such as a blocksize limit that's not multiples larger than average block size).

Yeah. As is discussed further in that twitter thread, bandwidth is obviously also a major concern. But that also tends to grow exponentially over the years. Specifically, it's observed to grow according to Nielsen's Law, which argues that bandwidth increases by roughly 50% every year. This is why Gavin's original blocksize increase proposal contained a roughly 40% per year increase (eg, staying well under expected bandwidth growth over the long term).

I don't think you're appreciating how much of a toy bitcoin seemed in 2010. Yes, many in the community at the time *did* foresee what it *could* become, but it still seemed a quite distant theoretic outcome. Only a few hundred people cared all that much. Contrast that to now, where Bitcoin makes myriad headlines every day, and is being discussed at many of the world's largest banks, central banks, and governments... The current reality seemed quite theoretical and far off in 2010/11. Against that understanding, and the fact that average blocksizes in 2010 were orders of magnitude under 1mb, it's not too hard to understand why Satoshi didn't feel much urgency to resolve the large block DoS issue more thoroughly at the time. 
But I do share Mike Hearn's recent sentiments on the issue:


patch this entire dispute would never have happened. He'd have put in some
kind of automatic timeout or limit riser because the plan was to remove it
all along, and then it'd be you guys arguing for putting a limit in place,
Gavin would object, it'd be controversial and nothing would happen. But
Satoshi never anticipated this bizarre attempt to turn the project into
something else and so figured he'd just remove it himself later. Too bad.

VC funds typically have requirements as to what the money can be used for. Almost by definition, a "Venture" fund's capital (especially the big ones) is to be used to buy equity (or often convertible debt) in companies.

Why "For a sufficiently large miner"? And what is the critical difference that a larger blocksize makes in any of these (inevitable/obvious) realizations that there exist economies of scale in mining?
Even if blocksize stays at 1mb, higher bandwidth miners have an advantage, so your logic would say that the highest-bandwidth miner will eventually become the sole miner. The same logic would say that the lowest energy-cost miner will eventually become the only miner... Indeed, such arguments are routinely used by folks who don't like the idea of POW (or Bitcoin) at all, insisting that it'll eventually centralize and defeat the entire purpose.
In reality, the tiny relative advantages, even in a commoditized market, tend to not be enough to yield a monopoly. Oil companies are perhaps a decent example; ie, the definition of a commodity product and long-running well-understood very mature industry, and yet there are still lots of them. 
The long-run equilibrium is actually that they start to vertically integrate and compete and differentiate at higher levels of the service stack. If I'm not mistaken, has some solid commentary on this...

I think in a *currency* crises (such as present in the EU right now), bitcoin will do well as modern gold.
In a *liquidity* crises, such as in 2008, I think people will be forced to sell bitcoin in order to cover debts denominated in fiat. That'd be the initial response anyway. The secondary might be buying (or hiding) bitcoin as an "exit" of sorts from a broken system.

Let's do some math...
From the Coindesk article about the Wedbush report:


1) Calc the total economic activity Wedbush is predicting to run over bitcoin in 2025 from the above three markets:
(10%)($5.9T) + (20%)($744B) + (20%)($924B) = **$923.6B**. 
2) Let's approximate the total supply of bitcoins in 2025 as the full 21,000,000 BTC issuance. 
3) Now let's calculate how much purchasing power each bitcoin would need in order for the whole system to transact $923.6B in one year, making the conservative assumption that all bitcoins are used for this (ie, none are sitting idle in cold-storage, etc). That means we need to figure the velocity of money for the economy (eg, how quickly a given unit changes hands during the year). Velocity is about 1.5 for the dollar. Let's say it's double that for Bitcoin (since bitcoin has a lot less friction). So, **V=3**.
Money supply = Total transacted / Velocity ... So, M = $923.6B / 3 = **$307.8B**
And now for the dollar-purchasing-power per BTC:
$307.8B / 21,000,000 = **$14,657 per BTC**
Lots of approximations and assumptions, but that's the guts of what Wedbush is really saying.
It's nice to see Wall St. firms starting to do the same calculations many of us made in 2011.

Well, it can happen in a country whose debt is not denominated in a currency that the country can freely print more of. Greece owes Euros, but does not control the ECB, so the only options are: stop using the Euro, or steal Euros from someone (eg, the citizenry). 
To be clear, the way out in a crises for countries (like the US and Japan) with massive debts denominated in currencies they control is simply to print more currency and use it to pay off creditors.

That assumes miners are irrational. If there were no cap, they'd keep blocks smaller than infinity in order to win orphan races. There's some equilibrium between probability of losing an orphan race due to a block that takes longer to propagate, and making up for that potential in transaction fees. That directly translates to some required average fee per KB, for a rational miner. So there's the fee market, and the pressure to keep blocks from getting too big relative to expected propagation time.

I wish both sides would just ack that the appropriateness of the permissioned and permissionless approaches vary with use cases. 
In my opinion, the permissioned ledger case effectively nets out to an upgrade to certain types of existing distributed databases, so in those cases where an organization needs to retain 100% control of their tech stack, upgrading an existing database system to use a blockchain-based permissioned sys *might* make sense. In my opinion, that's just not very interesting, though; at least, not compared to what "blockchain" has meant for most of the past 6 years. 
In contrast to the permissioned case, the *public* ledger is an entirely new thing that humanity hasn't had before; yes, it's also "just" a database technology at its core, but its public nature enables all kinds of new applications (such as credible electronic money).

I think ensuring that bitcoin maintains its status as ideal money is pretty darn important. As with all money, low-friction is critical to its usefulness. I do not think it's a smart gamble to leave the blocksize hard limit right around average blocksize. That's an impediment to adoption and network-effect; two other things which give money value. See "Fidelity Effect".
Furthermore, Core has shown that they *want* higher fees; ie, friction when using the money: 
That's awful, and incredibly disappointing. I realized in 2011 that Bitcoin is the best money the world has ever seen. For the first time, I'm questioning for how long that will remain true.

Huge gap between everyone can run a node on a 5yr old netbook, and "datacentercoin". By incentivizing rising fees now, you're making the wrong tradeoff. We don't have to walk either line yet (higher fees, centralization). *Eventually* it'll make sense to let fees rise vs risk meaningful centralization of nodes, but that's probably several halvings off.
No need to take the absurd risk of degrading Bitcoin's network-effect 7 years in.
@_date: 2016-02-23 14:24:37
If not for the fact that Core has shown that they *want* higher-fees (which breaks Bitcoin's claim to be ideal money), I *might* agree with that, though it's still a dangerous approach to take. 
But given  , I have little confidence that things will actually get fixed when the time comes, since Core doesn't seem to think that Bitcoin ceasing to be ideal money is a problem.

Stunning arguments. 


I assume you're referring to the March 2013 fork which took a couple hours to resolve. If you're asserting that when fees rise, core will immediately rally the community for an immediate hard fork, refer to your first quote above.
You and core both do not see high on-chain fees as breaking Bitcoin's property of ideal money, and/or you want Bitcoin to be something other than ideal money. That's the root disagreement.

Yeah, thanks for the lesson, but I've been aware of that since I read the whitepaper in 2011. And it's a good design. The alts that go for tail-emission strike me more as economic-meddling/over-engineering than anything else. Let the free-market take care of it via tx-fees.
What you "fee-market now!" guys needs to realize is that while tx-fees will provide mining incentive long-term, block-reward is still likely to be dominant for several more halvings. Furthermore, the only rational stable miner-income model when rewards are small is a high volume of low-fee transactions (low-vol high-fee is a fantasy that can typically only be enforced by monopoly/central-control).
The ideal path for bitcoin - and the one that we all implicitly agreed to follow during bitcoin's early years - was to keep tx-fees cheap while tx-vol was low, and that as tx-vol rose and reward fell, the vol would make up for the falling rewards while fees would hopefully still remain low (which would be the case if vol is high enough). Obviously there's variability in that and a number of possible equilibria, but we should be *striving* for low fees/friction - ideal money - and we're losing that ethos. That isn't going to just be a great loss for the purchasing power of my cold-storage, it's a great loss for humanity.
And FWIW, have some goddam faith in the free-market. Economic transitions don't need to be "managed" by developers at the code level any more than central bankers should need to "manage" the money supply. With sufficient transparency, free-markets allocate optimally.

Well said. For one thing, a Fee Event opens the door for alt-coins to compete with bitcoin (on bitcoin's core turf) *for the first time* in bitcoin's history. It will also slow adoption in general even if alts never become a threat. 
Some might argue that that's tolerable, but I think it's a huge gamble that's both unwise and unnecessary. Bitcoin is in a race to become as globally economically meaningful as possible, as fast as possible. It is far less vulnerable to state-level attacks if it's entrenched in the fabric of the global economy. To forego opportunity to make that happen as fast as possible is really missing the forest for the trees.

This is extremely disappointing. Since it opens the door for transacting bitcoin to become far more expensive than it needs to be, it puts bitcoin's network-effect in question for the first time. 
Since first considering the implication of alts in 2011, I've held the position that they cannot compete with Bitcoin's network effect in any domain in which Bitcoin exists. Only niche markets. Well, if the ecosystem gets behind this "consensus", that position changes. Never before have alt-coins had a legitimate chance to take market-share from bitcoin in a sustainable way, but they perhaps will if this "plan" becomes the uncontested roadmap.
This is a very sad day.

@_date: 2016-02-20 23:37:31


That's very backwards thinking. Since we *can* easily scale, while keeping fees low, we should. It's been the design all along, and if you'd asked virtually anyone in 2011/2012 if MAX_BLOCK_SIZE would NOT be raised well in advance of it creating fee-pressure, you'd get a very obvious "of course it'll be raised." It's nuts that we're still sitting here with a 1MB limit today.


Segwit is cool and all, but it's actually a huge change, as it's a fundamental change to the blockchain datastructure, *and* effectively introduces a new class of semi-full node. Both of those are far far more impactful on the ecosystem then going from 1MB to 2MB (or I'd assert, even much higher) on one const. I do think segwit is elegant and should ultimately be done, but just because there's the technical possibility of doing it as a rather inelegant soft-fork, does not mean we shouldn't take the obvious low-hanging fruit scaling solution and do a max-blocksize hardfork first.


First of all it's 17 months (*July* 2017), over which time obviously quite a lot can happen in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Like order of magnitude increases in many metrics. Unless there's tremendous empirical evidence to suggest that we should take a complex path that hinders ability to scale relative to an easier path that doesn't, I don't think we should.

If all the losses happened *during* the June 2011 hack, I'd expect to see one or several very large on-blockchain transactions that would somewhat obviously be associated with the event. Hence, I favor the theory that the hack led to stolen code or an installed backdoor which led to vulnerability exploitation over time.

The following will depend on your own personal character/preferences, but you may find that you feel a certain piece of mind holding a little bit of your wealth in an asset that no one can sieze or censor. That is theoretically the benefit of gold too, but gold is extremely difficult logistically in our electronic times. Bitcoin fills the need incredibly well, and people (yes, law-abiding, nothing-to-hide folks) do find valuable security in that, despite bitcoin's price fluctuations.

Well, you can do it in a *permissioned* way. That is, you can just assign some set of authorized validators to append content to a ledger (resolving any conflicts) that gets replicated throughout the network. Then use some nice cryptographic signing techniques to authenticate individual users of the system when they wish to add messages to the ledger. No blockchain necessary or probably even desirable in this case, and you've got a nice replicated ledger/database.
But that's essentially just a centralized API, since you have to assign validators. It therefore has nothing to do with Bitcoin or crypto-currency in general.

It's not about people having these sitting on their desks, or thinking of them as miners at all, really.

It's unknown what sort of commerce and machine-machine interactions will arise from that. And that's the experiment.

One of the core advantages Bitcoin has versus gold is that it can be directly used in the economy. It has direct utility as a medium of exchange. Gold doesn't anymore, and now that it's de-coupled from the financial system (since the peg was killed in 1971), my thesis is that it will slowly bleed its monetary inertia and head towards its industrial use value ($300-$400/oz or something). 
Arguing that bitcoin would be fine without some real use as a normal medium of exchange relegates it to the same class as gold; basically an industrial good. It'll have uses, but it will be nowhere near as "monetized" without meaningful touchpoints into everyday economic activity. 
There may be some middle ground; eg, if there are *enough* merchants/services worldwide who accept bitcoin that it's therefore valid for savers to consider it a store of value since they can always directly use it without going through the existing financial system at all, if they need to. **That right there is the essence of real censorship-resistance.**
So it should be clear from that that *more* direct use, more merchant acceptance, is a good thing and something the community should still seek.

That's the only way to do it. The wallet provider could also probably get fancy with nLockTime transactions (&amp; multisig?) to assure you that funds wouldn't move until you expect them to, and that you can revoke/prevent the funds from moving if you choose.
While you'd still be reliant on the centralized wallet provider to service the subscription payments, it would still be *much* better than forking over your CC to a merchant and having to *request* through them that they quit sucking money out of your account when you're done with the service.

Been "hoarding" for years prior to Daniel's article, and I certainly agree that people simply holding the coin is very important for Bitcoin's overall development. Higher market-cap fuels a number of very productive feedback loops. 
I also contend that it's critical for bitcoin to carve out direct use cases. Using it as a, you know, Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, certainly qualifies, and for all the reasons I laid out above, is critical. It's *not* putting the cart before horse to care about this now. It's understanding where the ultimate value comes from, the stage of development/adoption bitcoin is in versus potential competition, and the optimal path to ultimate widespread success. 
There's no reason you can't have both hoarding and spending, and it should be obvious that a bitcoin economy featuring both simultaneously is quite a bit stronger than either in isolation. I spend bitcoin often, and I top up my wallets often. Perhaps you don't know, but bitcoin is a pretty frictionless medium of exchange, so you can do that sort of thing...

That's not true at all. The radical *transparency* of the bitcoin blockchain is often hailed as a feature supporting financial and asset transparency, etc. Many of the ledger-type uses of bitcoin require this transparency. So the best you can probably assert is that adding *optional* stronger-privacy features is uncontroversial. 
And of course there's regulatory nonsense that bears mention. It's an open question whether the regulatory response to bitcoin would be harsher than it's been if the blockchain were opaque, by default, at the protocol level. My guess is a lot of people don't want to run that test with the bitcoin ledger, especially at this point.

No prob. It was an interesting thread. Cool that Ray is active on the forum.




You are, unfortunately, correct. People think in units, not percentages, despite the fact that the former is arbitrary but the latter is not. I remember seeing some CNBC snippet of Maria Bartiromo back in spring 2013 where she said (paraphrasing): "Can you believe that just one of these Bitcoin things is ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!??!" 
...anyways, the flip side of your argument is that people now consider bitcoin "expensive" and therefore don't bother buying/adopting, but if we used bits as the common unit, then people might think "wow, I can get 40000 bits for just $10?? What a deal!" (ahem: dogecoiners).

This is true. Many of us who hodl, supporting the value of the coin and therefore the entire ecosystem, realized a long time ago that a critical feature of bitcoin is its *assumed* ability to adapt to attacks as necessary. This hasn't really been tested in any meaningful way yet. Now that we're faced with a situation that, for the first time, threatens bitcoin's status as a free-market currency, it's time for the bitcoin community as a whole to update their software such that the system retains the ability for tx-supply to meet tx-demand.
But don't sit by and watch. Support BIP101. Support Bitcoin Unlimited. Hash at a pool that supports those. Politely explain these things to people who don't understand yet. The theory is not that bitcoin will magically correct itself to fend off the attack; it's that the rest of us will *act*.

Yes, it is. The kind that can drive use of bitcoin, as an investment, currency, and technology. All of which will drive price higher, btw, which also means more security, and a wider userbase to experience and appreciate the monetary freedom that bitcoin represents.

This is what formed my opinion of Charlie's attitude toward blocksize (and also made me lose a good bit of respect for him):


  
That's exactly the type of econo-engineering argument used by Core. It fundamentally dismisses the idea that a free-market can allocate resources optimally, that miners are rational, and it implicitly takes the view that PoW mining is a tragedy of the commons scenario and therefore cannot really work without centrally-planned economic-engineering. I think it's terrible that so many in the crypto-coin ecosystem seem to fundamentally not understand how markets work.


Raising the blocksize such that it acts as a throttle (eg, having max_block_size close to average blocksize such that fees rise) is exactly what needs to be avoided and what takes away the free-market dynamic that would otherwise form between users who demand blockspace and miners who supply it. So while Charlie may technically be in favor of "increasing" the blocksize, unless he's in favor of increasing it such that max_size is much greater than average size, it doesn't matter, and it's a bit disingenuous to imply that he's a proper large-block supporter.
As for some discussion of the mechanics of how a market-based approach (versus a Core-dev central econo-engineering approach) can work, I strongly recommend reading the following:

Here's mine: leaving a hard-cap in place amounts to deliberate economic engineering. The genius of bitcoin is that it leaves everything it can to the free-market. Blocksize should and can be one of those things. Lift the cap, and miners will choose blocksizes that balance demand for blockspace with the cost of producing and transmitting blocks. In every key variable, bitcoin opts for leaving details to the free-market, and I think blocksize too should fall into that overall philosophy which has served bitcoin well since the beginning.

I've used this app a bit. Seems to work fine, and I love the idea. More development (separate wallets, etc) needs to happen, but this is a great proof of concept. BUT, what it *really* needs is to auto-notify the recipient that they received a tip! I've been sending people bit-millis, and then having to go post a link to the app on their wall for them to even know they got anything. Is there ANY way around this, or is this is a Facebook permissions limitation that's unsolvable?

Hit their site:  . Says they're revamping the technology. Makes sense - they've had some issues since they relaunched the website with new services last month. Time to get it right, I guess.

Ah, cool. Thanks!

Can't be weak-minded, especially in new markets. Understand why you're taking the position you're taking, do your due diligence, and then don't knee-jerk react to anything unless fundamentals have changed that require you to modify your thesis.

It doesn't matter if you earn bitcoin, or not. Or even if someone hands you some bitcoin out of the blue. You should still make your own analysis of where bitcoin is going and why, and either hold it until your target, or simply sell it immediately. 
99% of people who think they can "time" the market are fooling themselves. Just do your own fundamentals analysis and act accordingly.
A bunch of the short term newbie speculators are simply going to get burned and then go around bad-mouthing bitcoin, which is both bad for bitcoin, and bad for themselves.

I would also like an answer to this question. Even just an update on the status of the CoinLab integration...?

Having been in btc for years, I consider a bump down to $31 from $34 to be noise. Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. We are bootstrapping a new global digital decentralized currency from nothing. This has never been done before. The market is finding a price, and that's an incredibly difficult and volatile process. Be prepared for 50% swings. I've held (and bought) through 90% swings. If you do not believe in bitcoin for the long-haul, sell now. If you see the potential, just build your position and then ignore the exchange rate for at least a few years.

Interesting topic for sure. Realize, though, that you're arguing to back to the backing itself. Bitcoin and gold are very similar. Bitcoin simply takes gold's advantageous monetary properties (limited supply, recognizable, durable, divisible, fungible, etc) to their intellectual extreme, and adds fantastic electronic transactibility. Gold served its monetary role because of its fundamental properties. People used gold to back OTHER things because of these properties. Bitcoin can and probably will similarly be used as the backing for other currencies that are missing some of these properties (gold-backing lent the dollar limited supply properties; that was the entire point. Bitcoin can do the same for various scrips, and is far better in an era where near-frictionless electronic transaction is necessary). 
In short, currencies get backed by other things because they lack one or more of the fundamental properties that make a good money. What is bitcoin fundamentally lacking?
