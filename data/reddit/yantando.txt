Do you have a link for that?

Tell that to Silk Road.  I get what you're saying, but the government can confiscate bitcoins like they can gold.

Trezor has made my life easier for day-to-day spending bitcoins.  I don't keep more bitcoins on my phone than I'm willing to lose by a single malicious update.  With auto-update I'm one update away from losing them.

Anybody know any background on these guys, a lifetime is a long time.

ddg master race reporting.  I honestly can't stand other search engines, if ddg doesn't give me good results i'm 2 characters away from another search engine that will, with the added ability to go straight where I wanted to in the first place.

I'm not going to do that for one app. Even without auto update its still not wise to rely on.

Is your beef a moral or legal one?
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:51:58
lol he ran pretty fast.

No you wouldn't.  If you did that you would go to jail, no questions asked.  You'd do what everyone else does when they get a gag order/nsl, you'd shut up and do as you were told.

Yes, that's capital gains.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:46:42
Nope.  There is is 3 or 4 memes on the frontpage here right now.  That's 3-4 too many.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:59:11
OK, I'm not trying to make it a contest or anything I just want to know when the users signed up who thought it was OK not only to post this garbage but defend it. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:26:59
No memes.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:19:22
No. You guys are like pigs covered in shit who just love their filth. Memes are the shit in case you were wondering 
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:38:15
I try to stay quiet most of the time, but the fact that memes were not only frontpaging here, but complaints against them were getting downvoted was very annoying.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:12:02
It's not a sense of if humor issue. It's a shitty post issue. It happens to every single subreddit that average redditors find. Every single time. I've been here for years and it is the worst thing about this site. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:40:40
Just wondering if this is your first account? A few months is not a long time. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:05:26
Honestly it got bad after digg v4. You were one of them weren't you? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:54:37
That's how this place was until then idiots showed up. You go start a place that smells like shit and leave us alone.
