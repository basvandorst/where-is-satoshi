Haha don’t be hard on yourself when you realized you missed a golden opportunity :)

Couldnt be happier to be able to buy the dip !!! For once it happened at the right time!! Will it be the last??? Not sure but no matter what happens it is an amazing discount that i wont miss!!

Haha no started buying recently when it was about 7-8k. Still new in the game
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:47:15
Looks like it will go down to retest 10k, maybe even lower. The wait is almost over though, don’t miss this opportunity because it will start booming seriously next month —&gt; the train is departing now :)))

You should really stop with your “ bitcoin is up 300% this year “ when asked why bitcoin is down. If i am looking to invest now and that i am not getting any profits from these 300% then i don’t care because it doesn’t guarantee that it will keep rising even though i believe so.

I believe coinbase has an insurance for stolen btc as long as it’s under 250k or something like that. You should check it out and contact them to see if your case is eligible, not sure if it’s if they get hacked or if you do.

Unfortunately i am forced to sell some btc that i have on my trezor for my business expenses.. been trying to avoid this but i literally have no other option. Frustrating to sell in october but that’s life.. What is the fastest way to sell the btc i have on my trezor for usd ? Should i transfer it to coinbase and cash it out? Thank you

Am i the only one who waits for the dip to accumulate more, and then only buy a little bit thinking it will dip more and it ends up going back up in a minute ? Lol. Should I wait for the dip again or buy it a couple hundreds more expensive before it moons? There are news about china imposing tariffs etc so not sure about the timing. Thanks!

Why are you saying to take them off asap? Did something happen?
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:12:22
Bakkt is definitely a factor but you’re right it won’t be the only factor needed for it to grow. The way I see it is that everyday there are positive news about mass adoption, just today square crypto hired one of the most reputed bitcoin developers to facilitate its use. Things are in motion and there is also this prophecy that says bitcoin will be at 16k in October. Not a big fan of prophecies but it actually makes sense
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:15:29
Been waiting for this !! Glad i didn’t fomo at around 11k, time to buy the dippp

Best way to lose your money is instant gratification. You gotta be patient, and emotionally detached. Best of luck :)

Who can help me stay optimistic with the recent crash? I believe in the long term project but I have to admit I haven’t seen this one coming. I am hodling no matter what, but need to focus on the positive because it was pretty brutal for a crash. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:52:22
Maybe it’s time to consider the prophecy is wrong...
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:11:52
If the pattern goes on, chances are we’re gonna witness something extraordinary. Brace yourselves hodlers, patience will soon pay off!!
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:59:26
Lol. What about btc in the red zone?
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:44:22
Im pretty sure they were people trying to control the market before too, the thing is that whenever it dips people are accusing “whales” when in fact this article shows that bitcoin has always worked that way and that those sideways actions are actually good. As of today, everything seems to point out we are in the same process which means we will have an exponential rise over 3000%. The prophecy makes sense to me for the first time and those small bumps on the road are actually needed for the price to moon.
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:56:50
It did happen twice though in the past, following a pretty precise algorithm so far. I am not saying it will happen for sure, but infrastructure won’t stop this from occurring. During last bull market, I am pretty sure there were skepticism regarding that law because at the time, when it was around 300$, who could’ve thought it will rise to 20k? This is just Bitcoin, nothing is impossible anymore. I also doubt whales won’t let it moon for the simple reason that very powerful people believe in the technology and bought bitcoin. It’s good to know we have some elite on our side too :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 02:47:57
Upward obviously. There is only one way and the way is up!!
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:52:35
Can someone explain why most alts are in the green and not btc? Are people converting back to alts?
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:55:14
No one really knows, but i think most of us want him to be correct. That being said, i hope things will start moving soon, i had big expectations with all the hype surrounding bakkt and september-october so it’s hard to see it stagning.
@_date: 2019-09-05 01:10:15
Brace yourselves
