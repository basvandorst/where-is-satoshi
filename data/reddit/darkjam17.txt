Wow! If you're being serious that's amazing, thank you! 
I'm using Android currently, so I'll go with the app you suggested. I had a wallet before but deleted it. When I clicked on my address to see what it was, it was sort of a random jumble of words. Is that what the address is? I just want to make sure!

It's sort of hard to explain, but basically the bitcoin was sent to my email. To use them it gave me a link to the website Snapcard; when I clicked the link it had me set up an account with them and when I completed the first two verification steps (confirming my email and cell phone number) it showed me how much bitcoin I had but to send/ receive bitcoin or to buy anything I have to complete the second steps of verification which is some information about myself, taking a selfie with an I.D. and taking a separate picture of my I.D.

Thank you! I try to practice reading and writing a lot because it's the main way to connect with people. 
As for my problem, I'm not taking this is a loss. I figured I might as well turn this into a positive and keep my account information safe until I turn 18. That way, I can slowly accumulate small amounts of bitcoin when I have the extra cash. It will also force me to save the bitcoins, who knows though, maybe in a couple of years the price will triple and I'll have an extra $20-30 bucks in bitcoin. I'll use this as an learning experience for the future and I'll be more careful by doing more research.

I'm not using much time honestly. I figured I'd give this a shot instead of totally letting it go to waste.

Nope! I had that app before but it wasn't working that well for me. The one I currently use is SlideJoy. It shows ads on your lockscreen and it does it in an unobtrusive way, thats the part I really like.

I can't thank you enough, I've backed up my account and i have a copy of my password in a few places safe.  
I should do a lot more reading on it though, bitcoin is a lot more in depth than I thought. I didn't go into this completely blind, but I definitely didn't spend enough time reading about all the small details of it. 
As for my wallet address, I've found it and I'll PM it to you. Thank you for the links and all the help!
