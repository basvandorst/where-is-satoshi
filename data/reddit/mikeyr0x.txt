Ledger wallet. Works as a browser plugin on macOS or Windows. Jaxx also works fine in macOS.

HODL. You seem uneasy by your messages. Just dont act on emotion and you'll be fine. Its only a matter of time.

What wallet do you use? I'm using Jaxx for a little bit but hesitant to move more funds from coinbase as it seems too new for me.

No bitcoin exchange/broker is fdic insured, thats big banks only.

I think most take that long. It sucks but whatever they lock in your buy price. Just have to be a little patient. Quicker to keep some funds in gdax or another exchange and buy instantly if you can.

Wait for Monday

Coinbase is good. No issues here. Their bank account deposit takes a while, about 7 days but has 1% fee which is the lowest I think.

Ahhhh. I was wondering how I got a buy in  yesterday when no other sources reported a crash that low.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:37:55
Depends what they announce! But think there will be fair amount of btc articles in finance publications online.

Same. Really sad to see all of these people jump in threads with no real issues just joining the hater bandwagon.

Good call about coinbase on mint. Small but nice to have there.

Same, no isssues here with coinbase. Its all depends on how you use it. Buys go through pretty quickly and they have a good system for automated recurring buys. Buy on any exchange and then transfer out asap into a wallet where you control the keys. Dont hold too many BTC in exchanges and split your estate across wallets.

Yeah they are having real issues handling scale this week. Unfortunately it tells a lot to the market that they cant keep up with the demand. No excuse imo but still I deal as their platform makes it easy for me to buy on the regular. I wonder if my recurring transaction will go through this afternoon.

I'd probably slice myself with it just for punishment

O, I was expecting to see a bunch of valuable Warhol, Banksy and Kaws artwork....

Whats the preferred exchange and wallet right now over coinbase?

Amazing to see the uplift in adoption and news just in the past few days (weeks?). This is big with Bovada, they are the biggest online sportbook.

Old news
Seems like they are just going to display coinbase balances in Fidelity accounts, like Mint does currently.
