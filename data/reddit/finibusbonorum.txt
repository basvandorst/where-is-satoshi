Where I live, I have zero practical use for BTC... So for now at least, it's a purely speculative investment. Still, I know about the underlying tech and believe in it. I think I am ahead of the curve and I want to throw more money into this!

I agree. I don't know anyone, with any demographic, age, education - - that has any interest in Bitcoin. This is in the age bracket of 27-55.
Ah, except that since I've been mentioning it at two or three occasions, one coworker and one relative have asked for some links to read.
For the most part, I think that Bitcoin is an extreme niche. Few people have heard of it. *But it's all over the media,* I hear you say. Well - - *we* notice that, but "most people" don't.

I beg to differ. There have been international rules for banks, minimum cash reserves and such, since forever. The housing bubble caused those rules to be tightened to the point where some banks are having a to set aside literally *billions* in cash, just parked in an account, just for the sake of "what if" and to satisfy those rules. There are strong and strict regulations concerning transfer of funds, and of cash. The requirements for anti-money laundering monitoring have been increased. 
Plenty of existing rules have been revamped, new rules have been applied, and yet more are coming.

The wording "semi-log" made me too think of a scale that is neither linear nor log. He means a log scale on one axis. I would probably call it a single-log scale. The X axis is linear.

But that's a risky thing for a retailer to do, especially when when he's so open about accepting crypto.
A retailer still needs to balance his books. He still needs to file a statement. As soon as crypto is more than a negligible part of the business, it's gonna show!

I just jumped onto the bandwagon last week, kicking myself for not throwing a couple hundred into it way back when - but better late than never!
So far I am purely speculating. Not doing much, just seeing the numbers rise while I try to figure out how much risk I am willing to take = how much fiat I am brave enough to exchange to ETH (because right now that seems to rise even faster than BTC).

Forgive the noob question, but I think that keeping things in software seems safe because I have that software backed up, and I have the passphrases / seed words backed up. 
A hardware device seems *risky because what if you lose it?* You can't have a backup of a hardware thingy. I haven't understood yet how hardware makes it more secure in terms of risk of *loss.* (In terms of risk of getting it *hacked*, I understand.)

1. What are their actual fees? Their website doesn't list anything at all, it's just a psychedelic headache and a link to the Play store. In comparison, Bitstamp fees are 0.5% and they support SEPA transfers (very useful in Europe).
2. How do you actually buy BTC with this app? How do you put money into the app? Do you need to have a credit card or bank account linked? Neither the website nor the play store description tells me this.
I'm surprised at the hype for this app, simply because there's so little description about it.

To be fair, that's not special to banks in Denmark. The 10000USD limit is all across the EU and probably in most other countries that adhere to reasonable anti-money laundering regulations. It's an unfortunate consequence that the small folk need to be bothered in order to (get any hopes of) catching the big fish. And still the banks fail hard at this. 
Same for paying a fee to let them play with your money, most banks I know of charge a quarterly account maintenance fee. It didn't use to be like this, but then again the interest rate used to be a lot higher so the banks had plenty money even without stealing from the poor.

No, because we can read. 
It clearly says, "Eat out from £5" and then as a subheading it says "including four favorites from £15". 
So pick any of those four, pay £15 and up. Pick among the other 896+ restaurants, pay £5 and up.

The reason to run the core software is to support the non-2x coin, right? Because it won't support the fork nor the forked currency? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:49:41
Except how could you do that while the coins are in cold storage like a Ledger? 
Any exchange where you set that order would need to receive all your coins before it could execute it, and you obviously don't want to hold lots of coins on the exchange just for that.
I guess there's no way to get around having to keep an eye on the market, is there? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:44:35

See, that's just speculation - nobody knows. That's why it looks like a repeat, and my statement above still holds: This is not sustainable organic growth but rather worryingly explosive and I think it'll collapse again. To a higher bottom than last time, sure, but these peaks are driven by entities with a short term agenda.
