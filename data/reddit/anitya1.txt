It's an investment in your company. We set up the starter option to be an alternative. From what we've seen in the market, the starter option is a reasonable option compared to going to a law firm that'll charge you ~$500/hr.
We hope that you'll consider all the terms in the expected value calculation to make your decision. The price is merely one term.

New Yorkers don't need permission to use btc either. This is for companies that are looking to grow into meaningful financial intermediaries.

Haha nope. Just a dude who left the traditional law firm world after growing weary of an ossified legal industry that doesn't understand technology or invest in r&amp;d. Figured teaching myself how to build software was a better use of my time. This is just a project I've been playing with for a little while.

The key issue is the expected value of investing the resources to get a BitLicense. For companies that can make a strong case to DFS, I suspect the decision to invest the resources is clearly +EV.
Focusing primarily on the short term cost for one step distracts from taking into account how getting a license plays into your overall strategy for gaining competitive advantage in the long run.

The polarized reaction here is interesting. What do you think about Coinbase's actions?

Thanks for the input. If you take a look at the features page, you'll see that we'll walk you through the process so that you end up with an application that's tailored to your needs. We use automation to make things simpler, but not simpler than they need to be to do the job right.
Also, we're still testing out pricing and what works for people. Overall, it's important to consider the expected value of investing the resources to get a BitLicense. The price is just part of the equation.

I mentioned this in another comment but I'll include it here also.

Also, keep in mind that this is just an initial prototype. The services are currently set up to be independent of one another so companies can pick and choose based on their particular situation.

What do you think about Brian Forde's way of thinking about this when he said:

This is useful info. Did you have all the policies and procedures in place before you started or did you have to generate them?

I'd be delighted to.
The industry has a lot of work to do to bring our legal infrastructure into the 21st century. I decided to experiment with BitLicenses with the goal of building more modern tools for this kind of work.
