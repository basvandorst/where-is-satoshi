I've sold it. The buyer seems to not liking it, I dunno.

And if it's dead, where can I restore the wallet? Where should I type those words?
@_date: 2016-08-13 08:32:27
That's true, that's why I'm using it.

Currently Google Voice is not supported as soon as our USA numbers are non-fixed VoIPs. But other countries might work.

Hi! In fact, free numbers are totally the same as the paid ones, the only difference is that they are public, not private ��
@_date: 2016-04-25 12:28:45
Fixed, thanks.

Sending an SMS is responsibility. Allowing users  to stay anonymous while sending an SMS means taking attention from governments, we don't need it yet.

Please note that now we support not only US numbers. Go check our FAQ ( for restrictions. There are some.

The techology within is a secret ;)
The aim of Smsogram is simplicity. You don't need to setup APIs, we don't need your email/real name/phone etc - you just buy a number and use it!

Smsogram is under Russian jurisdiction right now. Of course if they force us, we'll have nothing but saving IPs. But who cares about IPs ;)
Thank you, we'll add more information to the site.
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:25:43
Sorry, not yet. ASAP we'll fix it

Allowing anonymous  messages sending is a law break. Therefore we only allow to receive them ��
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:09:05
ASAP I get first customers :D

Smsogram is for receiving sms. That means, you buy a number and then specify it within some service like Telegram as your number and successfully receive a message, seeing it in Smsogram :)

Yep
