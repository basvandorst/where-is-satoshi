it has been sent from an exchange, any idea how long should i expect to wait ? i have never waited more than 30 minutes for a transaction to confirm once its on the blockchain.
thanks for giving me some hope.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:53:53
thanks for your reply.
in order to get the four confirmed, i should expect few days for the first each time to confirm ?

when you move huge amounts, not that you don't care about 22$, you want to be EXTREMELY SURE everything will go smooth and fast.

thats funny to read in every post how many people care about their retirement in their 20's 30's while they are not even sure to be alive the very next moment.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:27:12
are you aware that you pay for retirement far more than you could even get even if you live until the age of 80 ? are you aware that retirement system is a great failure ? are you aware that the only reason retirement age is increasing is its failure and that its still continue until it breaks and that you loose all your money ? 
if you want a retirement, build your infrastructure, dont rely on a salary, build your own income, that, either you live 20 or 80, you can rely on that income, not on a company that can fire you any time, not on a state corp that can run with your money and you can say nothing, thats how you build your retirement and above all your FREEDOM.

awesome continue building other's wealth fr 2 cents ( keep in mind if you get paid even a million dollars the company makes 100M$ ), but i think a skilled person like you knows that.

i agree with that, if we fully recover then there will be no despair, but if we go to below 5k from here people will completely loose confidence.
