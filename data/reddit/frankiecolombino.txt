So many people just read the word ‘bitcoin’ for the first time! ����

Regardless something needs to be done. we are operating under laws that can result in a tax liability even when a net loss is realized. absolute lunacy.

How old is this? National debt at 14T?!? LOL.. Those were the days......................

a date of this being reality is hard to estimate but among a slew of other events here are some things that have to happen:
increased scaling solutions i.e. mass adoption of lighting network or other 2nd/3rd layer solutions that will enable truly cheap and instant transactions to take place. that will make accepting bitcoin to be feasible for the likes of walmart, amazon, macy's etc.. will begin with these companies immediately converting back to fiat and slowly evolve to them holding a portion and then all of it.
breakthrough in the wallet convenience/security conundrum - currently most secure wallets are very complicated to the general public. most user friendly wallets are not secure enough for irreversible transactions (and are also still too complicated for non-tech folk).
increase in price so large that volatility is decreased. people aren't going to routinely spend btc if they perceive that it can still greatly increase in value. and the masses (not devout hodlers) will not want to have it at all if they perceive it can still drop &gt;40% in value over a short time frame.

Beautiful work anyways. Bravo ����

Have fun in prison my dude. Tell DPR I said “hang in there”.

Your assumption that normies would understand that this is a crypto related art piece is a stretch af tbh. 
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:58:41
THIS IS BARTAAAAA
@_date: 2019-12-27 00:14:58
Ahhhh. Right you are.
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:28:00
Pretty sure those are downvotes.. I've never seen a comment or post with that many downvotes.
@_date: 2019-04-27 14:14:44
To be fair, if there were no KYC’s required across all crypto exchanges and platforms laundering money would be easy as fuck.

Even though it's ten years old it still does not have enough societal infrastructure built up to function as a viable currency. # of retailers accepting is in decline. # of ATM's is in decline. Most people accepting will ultimately want to turn it back into fiat which adds time and costs to a process that is easily solved by using fiat to pay for goods/services/employees etc. The only functioning use cases as of now are: 1. A store of value for long term holders and people buying the low prices we are seeing now. 2. By far the world's best method of moving massive amounts of wealth in a short period of time.

when, if at all, is it morally acceptable to abort a bitcoin?
i would argue somewhere between 1 and 2 quadrillion hashes
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:50:44
Welp... We found out Peter Schiff's reddit username. 
You make alot of valid points except " There are so many alt coins out there, some are in fact better" - there is not a single ALT that is close to being as good as BTC in terms of security/immutability/censorship resistance. AKA the more important characteristics. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:31:48
Agreed we don't celebrate our birthdays on the day we are conceived. Bitcoin wasn't alive until the genesis block...
inb4 ethical debate about when bitcoin can be aborted

The biggest benefit of this movement is that it keeps exchanges honest and deters them from not holding enough coins to cover customers deposits. If we did this with fiat at banks across the world it would be catastrophic. We do not want exchanges to become similar to fractional reserve banksters. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:55:28
Sure it could. I was responding to the guy that said it had already happened. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:53:38
Ahhh I will be enjoying that sub.. thanks for the heads up, my dude!
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:45:55
This is silly. Assuming 14M accessible coins. Getting to $3,000 in the first place required the market cap to increase by $42B dollars. Getting to $1M from $3K would require a market cap increase of $13,900,000,000,000.00 - You read that correctly. 13.9 TRILLION DOLLARS. LOLOLOLOL

Our current system has a ton of horrible attributes but yes I have thought this through. Don't underestimate how much worse it can get. Believe it or not, the avg person (globally) is richer than they've ever been. Also refer to Venezuela for a good example. Imagine that on a global scale. 
EDIT: The 8,000 people you referenced already own the vast majority of land and production assets so their status in hyperinflation town wouldn't change anything. They'd just have an easier time pitching slave wage to starving people. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:04:42
Any valuation in this range would require the US dollar, Euro, Pound, Yuan, and Yen to go through extreme hyperinflation simultaneously. Could it happen? Global debt is 3x the global money supply and almost all new money requires debt for it to be issued. So it could happen but being 'bitcoin rich' is not worth the societal fallout that would occur in that hypothetical scenario. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:11:27
I would say it’s inflationary by default given that 12.5 fresh bitcoins are created every 10 minutes. However, given that 4-6 millions coins (including Satoshi’s) are essentially lost an will never enter the circulating supply, you could argue that the supply has had a net decrease over the past 5 or so years @ 657,000 mined per year.

Lol, we found em.

Not entirely honest, if you bought $100 of BTC last year Coinbase would've tacked on $20-45 in network fees and commissions.
