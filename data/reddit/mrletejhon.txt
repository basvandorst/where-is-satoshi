I have my scripts running. I'm just saying for the others.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:03:57
Yes, you can go to:

But what if it doesn't get approved and we downvote the real news.
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:20:26
The post looks more like a add to me

I talked with one of the artists and joked about paying him in bitcoin. He was not amused. And told me that bitcoin was never going to work... So I'm might say rip-off.

Not as common as in America. But I just checked and there is quite a lot of places where you can pay using bitcoin. Soriana and Extra are extra common stores in all mexico. And I saw you can pay almost all your bills using bitcoin.
It looks like a good service. Haven't tried tbh. I might give it a shot this December.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:19:05
Yes pretty good service

Check this out:


Looks like Soriana is "Accepting" bitcoin

Well you can pay using bitcoin on all 7 elevens. So it's something.

I've been trying to make videos in Spanish talking about bitcoin. They are not as great as him speaking, he is really way too good. Nevertheless I will keep trying.

What if we manage to manage some storj/sia/maidsafe nodes ?
@_date: 2019-02-13 08:17:59
What would you consider for a mesh network for TX broadcasts? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:08:07
Nice work !

So in the picture the bills of 50 are they stacked in 1 dólar equivalent? 
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:42:08
220.42 USD
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:57:52
So the problem is not bitID, more like the wallets.
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:57:23
It's cool. I think the fact you can't easily set the derivations path (aka chose you signing address) Makes it a little harder to set.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:41:01
What's bu ?
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:24:36
Maybe they could fix their API.

"The price you see on Bitmex is not dictated by your trades"  
It is it's called a future and it's a zero-sum game.
Learn how to trade before blaming the exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:51:36
For the futures it's the settlement price.
For the perpetual swap the difference between the index and the price at bitmex creates a funding fee.
Move the underlying, nothing happends because you are not paying at etoro

Batching &amp; segwit
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:13:47
The real question is do we care about who isn't convinced by bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-10-24 22:49:07
This is a must do. I think the % of change per day could be a nice indicator. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:10:38
Well 1 EUR is 123 JPY. And the charts might be using JPY hoy many bits can you buy
