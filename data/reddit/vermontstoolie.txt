Wellll, some people might be saying that about bitcoin investors next time it crashes.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:59:55
I saw someone confuse this earlier. I am new to bitcoin too, but I think you’re thinking of it wrong. The transactions don’t use much energy, just the mining. The energy used to mine costs money. It’s only worth it if the miners get a return on the money they spend on energy. The higher the price of bitcoin climbs, the more energy will be used to mine bitcoins. The “gajillions of transactions processed daily” would be fine via bitcoin. It’s just the higher the price climbs, the more energy will be used. That is until all the coins are mined at the 21 millionth coin.

People like Cuban because he’s rich, alpha, and brazen. The dude definitely has brains but he seems like a douche who is a bit too sure of himself in all of his opinions he espouses.

It was supposed to be a currency. These fees and wait times are not comprible to any currency. To pay these insane fees while claiming it provides security is silly, since security is a pain in the ass for bitcoin. Something needs to change to bring down fees and transaction wait times.

It’s a fake country at this point. These microstates take advantage of laws of the bigger countries around them to their advantage.

@_date: 2017-11-21 05:34:47
I’m def a noob but I think you’re overestimating the panic this caused in the short term. This is likely more impactful medium term  (1-3 months)

Y'all got your math messed up. 21 million club, not the 1 million club.

No, I thought you were going to take the money out of your 401k. The loan I think is actually a viable idea. But it’s a loan so I’m not an expert on those but those are of course a bit more complex.

Only problem with that is Coinbase is instant (it doesn’t show up for over a week but the price is locked in), where as GDAX you have to wait for the money to clear.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:45:23
Increasing monetary supply doesn’t mean inflationary necessarily.

This guys naive enough to get scammed by someone on Facebook of all places and has $25k lying around to invest, meanwhile I’m scraping by with triple digits in my bank account.

Ahh, taking advantage of reddit’s inherant contrarianism.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:56:35
I think putting money into Coinbase still requires you to wait. It’s buying bitcoin through Coinbase that’s instant.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:52:55
Thanks man! Can finally buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:21:21
People definitely have it figured out, I just started learning about 2 weeks ago, so I’m really the worst person to talk to, it’s just the experts probably get a little tired of explains so they are relatively quiet on threads like this so I thought I’d share my very limited knowledge.
The giant guides likely have your answers.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:19:15
Yes and yes.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:16:42
So the transactions are really using a ton of energy?
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:56:05
I read the bitcoin hype a few years ago and remember it being all about a new currency and no one ever mentioned it being there as a store of value. 
What happened with that? Why do transactions costs multiple dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:51:32
I found at least one [major media story]( declaring that.

Just bought a Trezor, haven’t opened it. What’s the pros and cons of upgrading.

Actually, this isn't what the concern was about, but over the next 2-4 weeks as Tethers are frozen, we will have the perfect experiment to test whether the Tether was or was not artificially inflating the price of bitcoin in the short term. This is actually a really rare opportunity, and we can see if it was FUD or legitimate.
edit: to clarify, the criticism was never that they were going to be hacked, it was that they were artificially inflating the price

Yeah, as fun as it is to hate on him, this is likely just a soft coup in a weird monarchy for the king to consolidate power.

No. Well, yes, but you’ll face a huge tax penalty, and the reason is exactly this. To dissuade people from risking their retirement for get rich quick scemes and keep it in a lower risk type fund.

Then people will think it’s an alt coin. Bitcoin is the brand at this point. I don’t think there’s a good solution to this problem.

Shitty chain, conservative owner who’s  NOT into raising minimum wage, healthcare for his employees, or sticking to slangin’ dough.  Made Peyton Manning shoutout his company after winning super bowl.

After all the coins are mined, then the energy use would be fairly minimal. 10% chance I’m understanding this correctly, but after all the coins will be mined, current state, each transaction would just be sending 2mb of data to verify the transaction but I don’t think it will be a big energy user.

Value of a currency has nothing to do with its viability to purchase something. That’s why decimal points exist. British pounds used to have some funky coin values even when it was the reserve currency of the world and worth a lot more.

Dude, this post is a joke. You sound so entitled like you're making demands. No one knows how much time it will take. It's an experimental currency. Is it too late? No one knows. There's no win-win scenario in investments, especially experimental digital alt currencies. 
It irks you that the top post is someone who made $1m and you didn't? Tough shit. You're allowed to speculate all you want, but you didn't invest then. That's capitalism, that's the free market. Someone took a risk that paid off and you didn't. They win you lose (for now). 
Now you need to take a risk. Is it this currency now or something else? That's for you to decide and there's a high chance it won't pan out.
