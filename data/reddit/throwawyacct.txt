Nah, just customize a few SASS variables to brand accordingly so it doesn't look like OTB Bootstrap.

This is absolutely huge!  Good luck gents.  If you can pull this off, it's a total game-changer.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:00:21
Yeah!!! People "who succeed or actually work to improve yourself" are LITERALLY SLAVE OWNER HITLER!!!!

You're looking at &gt; $100k plus ownership... 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:27:31
This is so true.  Linux is good.  I'm using it right now.  I'm a dumb jock as well ;).  It's better/faster/easier than Windows/OSX.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:22:59
Or, you could cut out the iTunes middleman :).
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:16:06
I think he was implying that registering domain of the guy's name feels a bit opportunistic on your part.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:23:38
He knows what prototype means.  He's asking what you consider it to be in this case.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:38:49
Ohh absolutely, it's magnitudes better than Paypal.  Wouldn't call it top notch, though.  Don't get me wrong, I love Stripe.  Their API is absolutely fantastic.  Just wish there was a quick and easy way to get a hold of them in time sensitive situations.  I'll have to check out their chat feature.
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:46:21
Fantastic talk!  Highly interesting and insightful observations.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:11:48
You know QE is ~$80B each month right?  Definitely not going to benefit the people... read about how it works.  It'll make you sick.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:50:15
The also improved the lives of (or at least mildly influenced) 450 million people.  Think about that!  That's more than the entire population of the US.  What are their lives worth?  What is adding pleasure/entertainment to that huge number human being's lives worth?  There is massive value in that.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:54:15
If you live in the U.S. you pay taxes on the dollar value of earnings regardless of the currency you're paid in -- Euros, Yen, Reals, etc.  Why would Bitcoin be any different?
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:57:47
All of the above? :D
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:38:22
Many reasons.  Not being ACID compliant is one.  Very bad juju when handling financial transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:51:19
Haha, no. Actually, I'm not. The people that know how to do what you are asking recognize the huge opportunity in this space and are already working on it. They're thinking millions.  
Not a chance you're going to get anything more than a wireframe/HTML mockup built in a prototype unless you learn and write it yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:29:42
It's a very poor means to try and avoid taxes though given the permanent and very public record of every transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:12:23
You can also forget a lock combo... or lose a physical document.
@_date: 2014-10-03 02:41:36
Yeah! Political correctness bot.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:50:20
Isn't an Ubuntu phone coming out sometime soon?  An open source OS on mobile could blow this market up.  Get pumped!
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:58:21
You can also do that with US dollars (or any other currency).  It's still illegal to evade taxes whatever currency you're using.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:56:54
The Euro would exists if the US banned it.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:59:53
lol @ the naive.
@_date: 2014-09-30 00:35:44
Ugg... it hurts the eyes.
Edit:  Seriously, the new design is terrible.  It is low contrast, and nothing more than a psudo upgrade to some flat UI trends.  Blockchain.info's devs are some of the most awesome dudes out there.  They are seriously dominating the back end.  But, totally struggling/neglecting the front end...
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:58:33
omg, the blind hypocrisy.
Edit:  Ohh... I just realized you were joking.  
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:33:03
This comment resembles a case of [Stockholm syndrome](

Might want to check with your accountant/tax attorney on that one.  If you sell a product for Euros, the revenue is counted on the books at the US dollar value at the time of sale -- at least in a cash basis accounting system.  Profits gained from trading/hedging/holding various currencies is counted as a capital gain.
It is a gray area though.  Check with your guys if you're doing anything significant.
@_date: 2014-11-11 23:27:36
Dumb question... is changetip open source like dogetipbot?  Couldn't find a repo.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:51:49
60's civil rights thing.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:13:59
Not what I'm talking about.  You're confusing income and capital gains.
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:10:27
Out of the box.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:50:03
Yes. You are absolutely missing the point.  You're also asking the wrong questions.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:39:53
Yeah, no doubt it saves them a ton on time/training/etc... Interesting point on security.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:26:10
She is, of course, correct.  It really warms my heart that she said this publicly.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:19:47
Don't cheat yourself with a tl;dr.  This is an excellent article.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:10:07
Meh, their support is... ok.  No phone when mucho $$ are on the line in a time critical industry isn't ideal.
@_date: 2011-06-04 18:40:38
Probably the result of a few articles hitting the MSM and more people entering the market.
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:35:33
The fact that you (if you are representative of the bitcoin community) even think like that is pretty much a sealed gaurentee that bitcoin will not be take seriously.
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:23:41
Because votes are obvious validations of legitimacy.
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:22:18
I rest my case.
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:16:06
Yeah, a good exchange involves much more that "open source" programing... in fact.  Programers are a minutia part of developing a good exchange.  The "basic ideas" are things that the NYSE and FOREX have thought about for hundreds of years.  I lol at the retarded nerds who think they can effect a legitimate exchange from scratch, ignoring hundreds of years of history.
@_date: 2011-07-13 03:14:13
Where could I find one of those?
@_date: 2011-06-23 09:05:44
The irony in this comment is almost painfully comical.
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:16:07
Good point.
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:51:33
I'm working for a greater cause.  Hoping that the idiots running bitcoin right now will wake the fuck up, realize what they have, and take it seriously.  And, at least have the humility to realize they don't know jack shit about finance and exchanges.
Edit:  They may be brilliant computer programers.  But, they know zero about financial markets (as demonstrated in recent months).
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:31:14
Obvious reply from someone who has never worked in an actual financial market.
Appologies for violating your delicate sense of self entitlement though.
Edit: looks like the nerds like to censor by downvotes... Because, everyone know that concencious equals truth.
@_date: 2011-06-07 15:52:04
As a "user" I can confirm what 54mf said.  Most 14 yo's can use paypal or a credit/debit card.  Not so much for bitcoin.  Long way to go to make this practical, but I believe cryptocurrencies are here to stay.
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:19:45
Agreed.  It will get bigger, and other crypto-currencies like it.  This is the next evolution in money, imo.  There are just some giant hurdles that have to be crossed for bitcoins to become legit or even considered by other financial circles.  And, they aren't technological.

I had a lot of success with 'Instant Echecks' while playing online poker.

I'm here for the gangbang...
@_date: 2011-07-12 06:47:21
Thanks.  That is an awesome reference.
@_date: 2011-06-04 20:14:57
What happens to your bitcoins if your computer blows up and/or you lose your address?
@_date: 2011-06-04 20:52:06
Yep, it's called arbitrage and people on Wall St. make big money doing exactly that.
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:13:04
Bitcoin is a fucking joke and far from being anything other that a nerd's playground.  Sorry for the cold hard reality.
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:34:09
This mentality is exactly why bitcoin will fail... and I say that with the best of intentions.
Think about this for a second genious... My dementia afflicted grandmother can figure out how to use the USD.  But, there is not a G'damn chance she will ever use bitcoin.  If only computer geeks can effectively use it, how the hell do you ever think it will become an accepted currency?
I'm saying this with the best of intentions...
@_date: 2011-07-11 16:56:35
Haha, thanks.  Actually, that turned out to be a problem with my ability to spell.
