You're right, I shouldn't have said "you mean".  My bad.  You could definitely be right.  Who knows.

would you prefer it if your city had limited things to 1 lane while we wait for teleportation technology?

I also just did it!  I loved bitcoin then tried to use it.. weeks later my funds weren't sent.  Today I spent 50 damn dollars to move my remaining funds out of my wallet, still wondering when it will happen.  I just sent some Raiblocks to my wallet and by the time I tabbed over to my wallet account the funds were there.  For free.  Amazing

Raiblocks remains to be seen, it will probably be slower than today but still fast.
Iota will be faster the more volume it gets by design.  
That's why I invested in both.  They use DAG instead of a blockchain, which is why they do not have the same issues.  I would agree that BCH, LTC, etc. will have similar issues as BTC today (though at higher volumes than the current BTC volume, due to their higher block size).

I agree with you.  I am a big fan of AA, and the idea of people mining bitcoin performing electricity arbitrage is certainly interesting.  But it does not answer the question, and the bottom line is that a *ton* of unnecessary power is being wasted in Bitcoin, so it is not environmentally friendly or sustainable.
An unfortunate part is, the higher the price of bitcoin goes, or the lower the cost of energy goes, the more unnecessary power will go into it because it will be more feasible and profitable relative to energy prices.  High energy prices are not good for anybody.

Same argument as folks who say that bitcoin will fail because it hasn't transformed the world yet

Thanks for the helpful info!

Increasing block size to 2 or 4 or 8 mb does not mean it will increase to 300-1000.  That is slippery slope BS.  By your logic, maybe we should make block size 1kb and have a *truly* decentralized system.
What do you think of lower time to mine blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:25:59
anyone invested in btc does so because they foresee mainstream adoption.  otherwise they are just tulip hunters.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:43
Specifically for the application of payment, if DAG works feeless, secure and instant like it does now, I don't see any reason to use a blockchain
I am sure blockchain will continue to be very useful for technologies other than payment where DAG is not

It's wasted because it's unnecessary to use that much power for the network.  
It is unfortunate that low energy prices or high btc prices, which I see as both good things, could now cause increased environmental pollution, which I see as a bad thing.
Some other posters are saying well, the price of energy should rise.  I disagree and believe higher energy prices due to increased demand is bad for everyone, and higher energy prices is a bad way to limit mining resources

I am getting spooked by the fee increase.  
I tried sending $15 to test a transaction, using the breadwallet "economy" option for fees.  It has still not gone through weeks later.  The regular fee option is like $15.
Bitcoin does not have forever.  If it never fixes the fees, it will be superseded by a different crypto.  If it doesn't fix the fees fast enough, it will be superseded.  And all bitcoin has going for it is its adoption, relative to other cryptos.  If it loses majority adoption, I really fear for it as an investment.
It makes me scared.

you actually can.  I won't post them here because I'm sure that's against the rules, but you can check my post history for which other 2 cryptos I am interested in which do promise these things. One fully works right this moment.  The other has a certain technology coordinating things which some argue make it centralized, but which the devs claim will not be needed once the technology has more adoption.  Both use a technology other than blockchain, called a Direct Acyclic Graph.

good interview - i have a couple questions:
in response to when lightning will be here, she says it's been out since January.  Since none of us are using LN channels to avoid fees up to $50 right now, clearly that is not the answer to the question which was being asked, which is when will we see the benefits of lightning.  so when is it going to actually get here?
in response to how hard it will be to use, she says it's automatic and happens in the background.  really?  if that's true and there's no opening a channel and do this and do that BS that I've seen thrown around here, that's awesome.  But that's not what I've heard?

wasted energy = energy consumed without providing a significant-enough benefit to people
for example, throwing gas in a pit and lighting it on fire is wasted energy.
wasted energy is bad in the environmental sense, because energy consumption generally is from energy sources which are environmentally unfriendly.  even solar panels, wind, etc., while green and better than traditional sources, are net negative for the environment.
more demand simply does not lower prices, no matter how many ellipses you use while stating it.

Look at the chart for raiblocks, a cryptocurrency that actually works like everyone wishes bitcoin did. 
Bitcoin proved people will invest in crypto, now better tech is being rewarded.
Id trust ethereum to keep moving, but have you tried transacting with bitcoin?  It blows.  And transacting is all it does
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:20:53
thanks!  what I have heard about opening a channel doesn't seem so automatic though - even if it could automatically select who to open it with, my understanding is you have to make a decision to prepay a certain amount to the channel.  any comment on that?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:37:20
If I am wrong please tell me why!
i already told you the term "wasted" is in terms of environmental impact.
I think you have an interesting point regarding making solar and wind more competitive due to constant demand.  But I disagree with the net outcome.  Mining ops run 24/7, and would just be a base increase in demand for an area.  A mining op doesn't want to turn off some or all of its computers some parts of the day.
If we have 2 kW daytime demand and 0.5 kW nighttime demand for an area, and we add a 1 kW mining op, we now have 3 kW daytime demand and 1.5 kW nighttime demand.  The demand is still variable, and we would need the same amount of adjustable-power-generation (coal for example) to fill in the gaps.  
Solar and wind energy are more environmentally friendly than coal, yeah.  But they are still not environmentally friendly in general; that is, creating solar and wind energy projects and consuming their power causes environmental pollution.  So having more wind and solar is only a good thing if it means we need less coal / etc

because transacting with BTC is infuriating!  See my just-posted thread (edit: now deleted), I tried paying $50 fee to get my BTC out of my wallet and it is stuck!  The recommended advice is to pay *more* to a miner to accelerate two previous transactions. (Edit: I was thankfully able to double spend instead of paying a miner, but I still paid $50 and was freaking out for hours figuring out how to do it and waiting to see if it worked)
Meanwhile I also moved XRB today, which took literally seconds and was free.  My second transaction appeared in my wallet before I even had time to tab over to it.  THAT is what I signed up for when I bought BTC after listening to Andreas!

you mean you'd rather have everyone move to another city, because they aren't dealing with the traffic
increasing the block size to 2 or 4 mb would not exactly be a travesty like you are portraying it
I am not a BCH fan due to the politics.  They're not BTC's only competitor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:40
What do you think of the idea that futures will actually allow lots more investors to enter the bitcoin (buying the coin itself) market, since they can now hedge?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:22:49
Very true!  I look forward to the stress testing as it gains popularity
