no, it needs to hold steady for a few more days for my deposits to clear, THEN it can take off :-)

agreed, and also its good practice to transfer to a wallet so that you have the actual keys. that way you have a paper trail when, not if, the tax man cometh.

Since he stated "I might need to cash out", to me that implies he is selling BTC and transferring that money to his US bank (since he explicitly stated his bank is in the states). Any transfer into or out of the bank that equates to over 10k will file a CTR, and yes, I believe this applies to ACH transfers as well. 
On top of that, if you were to say, make multiple transfers to get around the 10k limit, that could trigger a suspicious activity report and be considered structuring.
In reality, simply transferring 10k from his exchange account to his bank is no big deal, just that a CTR *may* be generated and sent to the fed. Has nothing to do with the IRS, just that the deposit was/is tracked and there is a record of it in case anything suspicious or illegal is suspected.

Yes, if you deposit *in a bank* any amount over 10k (or several deposits which amount to 10k), the bank will fill out a CTR report (currency transaction report). This is basically to combat money laundering and gets reported to the fed.

i am stuck in a spot where quite a significant portion of cash is being transferred to my bank so i can buy in, but its taking its ever loving time, and the damn price keeps going up!! stop it damnit!! lol.

This is the most stable I’ve seen BTC ever lol. It’s like no one wants to make a move because they know a bunch are selling at 17, so they don’t want to push the price up lol.

Tell me about it. But it’s a much larger amount than what I would normally transfer, so they are doing some extra checks, etc, which I don’t blame them. But it still sucks.

Understandable. It's been a while since I've taken BSA training, and I know the rules regarding cash transactions, however, I do recall that somewhere the bank secrecy act has a treatment for ACH/EFT's. Either way, OP has nothing to worry about regarding this transaction.
And yes, I know its sent to the Treasury... I and my co-workers simply use 'fed' as a general term for anything gov't related, sorry for any confusion!

Ha! Oops, I should clarify the ‘few dozen coins’ is in LTC. I only own a few full BTC. The majority of my bag is in LTC in terms of # of coins.

So I’ve used CB almost exclusively when I first started, and now I have recurring weekly buys set up in Coinbase. 
I have everything stored in a Ledger currently except for a few dozen coins that have racked up from weekly buys. 
Im curious to try out other platforms. Gemini has me interested. How does it compare to CB Pro?

This. Crypto is obviously legitimate enough to warrant this type of hearing, and just by bringing it up they legitimize it further. 
If they were smart, they would be buying as much as they freaking could. Imagine if the govt quietly purchased a few million BTC and held it in reserve. That could go a tremendously long way in terms of financing budget line items in the future.
