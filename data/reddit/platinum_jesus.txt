A typical country's currency denotes the photos and icons that represent said country. Can someone please explain the significance of each person with respect to Crypto Currency, or Global culture?
From what I can tell, it's just academics?

Let's say I pick up the tab at dinner because my buddies don't have cash. I'm very interested in being paid back instantly. Typically, they'll do e-transfers which cost $1 each and are a pain in my ass to redeem because of the "secret question".

Canada is not a part of that, so unless China wouldn't allow $10k CDN worth of Yuan to leave the country, then it would be fine.

Bring the Yuan back to Canada. You don't have to declare more than $10,000 at customs, then you can exchange the money in Canada for a more favourable exchange rate.
