You may actually be retarded. Unless rich to begin with, then you would just be inefficient and stupid.

You're totally right! Why look at Bitcoin as a currency at all? I personally use the voltage in wires from Bitcoin transactions to fondle my anus. Get over yourself.

I fear you are dumber than you sound.

Okay, thanks for your response. I agree completely with the idea that volatility is dropping over time with adoption which in this case is really market cap. I also understand how Bitcoin works and am a proponent of it, the long analogy I dont think was needed.

1. Nice salt
2. I never argued that it doesn't have a price? My argument is how it's traded negates the actual use of it.
3. Also completely possible due to loans and leverage. Ever wonder why quantitative easing involves cutting rates? Because it creates cheap leverage for people to invest.

I totally agree with you there, our current monetary systems are not built for our benefit.

I think a meaningful step in a crypto war for crypto users would be to use crypto at will every single time they can. If that is the case then it's like marijuana in the United states for illegal states. Use is so prevalent that laws are almost forced to come to legalization or partial decriminalization or they have to publicly face the wrong they do.

Okay, the thing is gold as a heavy physical asset (unless you're trading gold securities) is super inconvenient to trade around obviously. I guess if you look at it purely as a store of value then your "enormous upside" is the same for any other asset without a significant intrinsic value. A good store of value is going to maintain its price level somewhat consistently which Bitcoin doesn't do unless it is used as a stable currency. I just don't see the merits in that argument.

Okay, dude your idea on why they want to ask you about crypto is just not correct. Maybe when you can actually buy things with crypto and not just trade it as a speculative device then a bank as an organization may be slightly worried for their own sake but the individuals processing your loan really care fuck all about which things you buy. For the lending standards (you are literally asking them for money and expecting them to not look at anything) they are required to look at what things you buy especially investments.

I like your point on Bitcoin being a sort of way to avoid big brother. And essentially we just need to reach a tipping point of adoption before  Bitcoin can stabilize and transition to currency. But yes with risk comes reward and everyone has their own risk tolerance but I wouldn't necessarily say concentration is to grow wealth. Concentration in this is example doesn't address the fact that it can grow or completely deplete wealth. Two sides of the same coin I suppose.

Why so?
