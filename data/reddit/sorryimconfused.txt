I thougjht this notion was crazy at first but with Mike Hearn cheerleading Ethereum threads. Reddit bots also being used to spam for Ethereum. I beginning suspect a lot of people who were previously invested in Bitcoin invested in Ethereum and worked together to pump the price while attempting to discredit Bitcoin. I still think its an interesting project but I really feel there is high level political game being played right now to shift power to a token those people own.

Bought plane tickets recently, laptops in the past months. 
I have bought a lot of things over the past 4 years using them.

There are no other cryptocurrencies that focus on security and stability. There are also no other cryptocurrencies that have as much hashing power in sheer watts as BTC. The distribution despite having so much more hashing power is better than for example Ethereum.

You shouldn't respond to trolls, it legitimizes them.

One is a secure store of value that slowly updates and focuses on stability. 
The other is a highly experimental EVM client that runs code put on the blockchain. It is interesting but its a very dangerous store of value considering the layers of complexity.

The switch would actually be a lot easier than you suspect.

You should do a histogram of lines of code he contributed to the Bitcoin Core codebase. I think you would be surprised.

Which? Only other interesting cryptocurrencies don't fill the same niche since they are implementing very experimental concepts that could have major bugs and cause massive loss in value. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency which holds a lot of value and stability and refinement of the protocol is the focus.
I don't agree with this guy though. I think multiple clients run by different people is the best situation for the Bitcoin protocol. It breaks up stakeholders and the community votes by picking a client.

I'll be skeptical until the BTC arrive in my personal wallet.

I think its IBM + Linux foundation, you may but right but only one way to find out.

A lot of exchanges prevent you from withdrawing large amounts, so you are forced to slowly withdraw your funds over the course of a month if you have significant amounts.

It will go through eventually, a miner will eventually add it because there are a few miners who will add any transaction. It can be a few days though sometimes.

I disagree, I think reading other peoples code is very fun.
Didn't see any code those just a readme.

Yeah, it was overtly an ad, but most people just read headlines and move on.

Gnunet is preferred in my opinion, it does not uncessarily add cryptocurrency, doesn't have the issue of people squatting names and is a really robust system.

Bitcoin/Blockchain is the consensus solution, that is one of its biggest accomplishments.

Thank you, I did end up finding it. Its a very interesting project and I just got into golang so I will have fun reading through this.
