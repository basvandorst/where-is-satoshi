Are you... are you still in High School?

The breadth of Trump's knowledge is comparable to a trickle of piss in a gutter. The guy's obviously, glaringly stupid. I don't know if you're a troll or an idiot, but you need to take a good long look at yourself.

All of those things were handed to him by circumstance. His only true talent is exploiting America's eternal love of snake oil salesmen.

Don't need to be omniscient to know things that kids in high school know.

I mean, he learned what the Nuclear Triad is for the first time when a reporter asked him about it on the campaign trail. This has happened a number of times with all sorts of things, most recently water purification kits. But hey, I'm not going to change your mind when part of a weird, Trumpian collective Dunning-Kruger thing.

He doesn’t have to make you a cake with a specific design, but he has to make you a cake.

Oh, noticed your username includes “Pepe.” Not going to waste my time arguing with one of old male Paris Hilton’s amoral head wound victims.

A lot of people live places where there *isn’t* a different baker. Why do you want the world to suck? I’m guessing it probably caters to how you look and how you are.

I feel for you as a musician, but comparing infinitely, freely reproducible files to a house just doesn't work.

SCOTUS screwed that one up. A business should not be able to refuse service because someone belongs to a category but should be able to ban problem individuals. In other words, Coinbase should not be able to discriminate against Milo because he’s gay, but should be able to refuse him service because as an individual gay man he is a total piece of shit.

No, it’s “MAGA people are extra stupid and shitty and as I’m a sane, decent person, arguing with you is beneath me and a waste of my time.” And you’re probably wasting *your* time because you should be figuring out which Jersey Shore cast member is the most racist so you can elect them President next.

I guarantee if you ever lived in a world where restaurants refused to serve you or motels refused to rent you a room you would cry louder and longer than anyone on the planet. And hopefully someone would be there to say “cook your own food” or “sleep in your car.”

Nah, it’s always pretty clear when a place bans people because of class discrimination rather than them being problem individuals. Nowadays nuance is on life support, but everyone knows that these individuals aren’t being de-platformed because they’re “conservative thinkers.” Anyone pretending otherwise is dumb or lying.
