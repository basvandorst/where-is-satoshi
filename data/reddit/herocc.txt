Tried doing that on my server once, didn't work out. Good luck to PlayMC, and that they fix it!

Is bticoin a new alt coin or something? :)
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:21:45
Scroll down a bit, TwitterBot still has it.
@_date: 2014-01-02 04:07:51
The website is down for me. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:04:24
I created the key myself, but I don't think my PC was compromised, and I shredded the key after I was done with it. 
I checked with Gmail, and with their logs, there is no breach outside of my IP addresses.
I am following that tutorial partially to help me create my Cold Storage, thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:01:57
I would like to run P2Pool, but I cannot run a full Bitcoin node. Is there another way?
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:46:03
BitcoinTalk doesn't have 2FA, and I just got a PM from him claiming that my stolen funds were unrelated. I checked the address, he took many others ttoo. There is no trace of it anywhere else.
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:38:32
I am doing a virus scan now. I will no longer be generating addresses from here. 
I have an old netbook, and I am going to keep that is Armory Cold Storage. It is not connected to the internet.
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:27:36
Yes, it is a vanity. I left my computer on for a while and generated it using VanityGen. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:09:00
Bitcointalk, about a year or two ago. Windows 7 Home Premium x64 (this one). Yes, I think I was.
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:31:17
Just finished. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:44:22
How do your friends react when you tell them, if you tell them? So far the only reaction I have gotten is they thing I am crazy, Bitcoin is a scam, or have no idea what I am talking about.
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:45:02
I would do it. Just make it secure and open source.
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:46:24
Android ClockworkMod ROM. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:47:40
Yep, even your first satoshi is something to give yourself a pat on the back about!
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:27:20
Yes, I also want to know about the price for BITCORN
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:34:29
The problem is, I might have had too many backups. I lost track of how many I had and if they were encrypted or not. I still have access to the address and can sign messages to it, but I cannot get the funds back. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:57:02
Use the bitcoin tip bot!
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:32:35
I use Authy for 2FA on my Android phone. I use CWM ROM so I thought that was secure enough, but it might have been elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:36:38
Some are Armory Files (Encrypted) some are Wallet.dat (Encrypted) some are blockchain.info (Encrypted). I have so many I may have lost track of them, or maybe I accidentally saved an unencrypted one.
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:26:32
May I have a bit of a bit in Bitcoin please?
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:37:02


@_date: 2014-05-20 01:36:30
I used to run a node, but the bandwidth and hard drive space got to much. I have been waiting for this feature in Bitcoin Core, is there another client that does?
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:58:10
Happy cake day, from a guy who missed his twice. :-)
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:40:19
True, I have heard of lots more lost, but for me it is a lot. I don't have a job or steady income, and I have been working on getting this for about 2-3 years I think.
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:48:16
How many features are still untapped. There are so many possibilities that Satoshi has provided, available to be used! MultiSig transactions, all of the coming features for core, the openness if it all. It is awesome!
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:33:18
I got an email from them too, but that address was not generated from their site, it was on my own computer.
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:03:57
Awesome! May I please have some?
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:42:54
VanityGen on my personal computer.
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:24:09
The article is alright,  though. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:22:02
What is the purpose behind that? Why run a Core node signaling for BU, instead of regular Vore or regular BU?
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:41:18
Bullet 1 and 2 aren't bolded, 3 and 4 are.

Supposedly the Ledger Nano X (and maybe S) is going to get smartcard / gpg support in late September
@_date: 2016-11-10 02:45:23
Does it support android pay?
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:51:25
I don't encrypt my hard drive, but if it becomes a law that you can't, I plan to start.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:12:59
This is great! Although they did say that Bitcoin had a CEO.
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:19:12
What website is that? The comparisons look neat
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:58:27
How did y'all get that expert flair? I want one, too!
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:35:32
UASF isn't a software implementation (yet), its a UserAgent string added to core. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:22:28
Not every computer has a dedicated GPU and a way to access it via a browser, and usually requires extra software. A CPU doesn't need extra software, is accessable to the browser, and every computer has one
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:46:20
I love you too!
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:27:25
Got this too, wonder who is actually sending it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:54:56
I got this too, was your email leaked from coinbase too?
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:04:02
I am getting a 502 error when I try to visit your site.
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:00:50
Nah this is running a full node, it's different
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:28:36
They are telling glyph to remove bitcoin features.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:11:46
Yes it is. It just uses Scrypt instead of what bitcoin uses.
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:42:00
I don't veify myself on anything. Over to BTC-E!
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:33:42
Where do people get all these emails? 
@_date: 2013-06-11 11:31:22
Darn. I didn't want network fate to move that fast. Oh well... Oh and good job!
@_date: 2013-09-07 13:11:56
Bitcoin is going to the sky's! That's a flying unicorn!
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:55:32
Keeps reminding me how awful the TX fee is...
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:55:54
I think they are updating due to the android glitch. Or, everyone was rushing to get their coins and crashed the server.
@_date: 2013-09-12 21:54:15
Looks awesome! When you release, this will be my new wallet. I love the multiple protocol part. Let me know when you release it!
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:02:03
Yeah, saw that too. Feel bad for the guy who bought it.
@_date: 2013-09-07 13:26:17
Looks cool! Share it with TradeFortress. He may like it. :-)
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:51:49
That is actually a great idea!
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:15:09
Yes, there have been several.
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:27:22
Oh, sorry didn't see that.
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:54:05
Cool! I wonder how your coworker will feel when you tell her how much it is worth now. Make sure she keeps the paper wallet safe!
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:54:08
I am sorry, but can you give us some proof of all of your statements on this thread? There have numerous news articles from trusted sources supporting that YOU are lying, and apple IS removing apps because of bitcoin. 
For example, here is one:
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:27:01
Good for you, this is one of the biggest tips I have ever seen!
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:36:12
Search for VanityGen. It is on github. There are also websites, and some threads on BitcoinTalk where you can get one. If you make one yourself, it may take a while. (From what I understand, it generates lots of address, trying to find the right one)
And yes, you can get one for altcoins, but you need a generator for that specific AltCoin
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:15:56
You will never find my email. Never! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:42:29
What did you download? These are codes, there is nothing to download.
@_date: 2013-09-07 13:24:09
Eventually, it will confirm. It may take a while though.
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:38:39
Where is the group buy? I want one!
@_date: 2013-09-08 02:10:28
I see it. It is strange, PayPal = eBay. PayPal ≠ bitcoin. EBay ≈ bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:29:53
I need this
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:33:05
Cool! I literally just got an invite. Great job!
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:30:43
It may have been. Depending on where he downloaded the jailbreak from. It may have been an infected file, or a backdoor.  I am not an expert about jailbreak,  but that is what I have heard. 
Can another apple user confirm? (I use Android) 
You are right about the Mac anti-virus though. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:34:18
I remember the days when I thought $200 was expensive. Ah, memories!
@_date: 2013-09-07 13:23:12
There will be TX fees, and by then bitcoin will be more popular, so more TX fees, and they will hopefully even out with reward today.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:50:49
Ah, OK. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:50:23
I would make it rain, but I do not have enough Bitcoin to give them.  :-( (Unless they wolud like some dust for future TX fees!) 
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:51:38
I see that now, I missed it in the title. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-10 11:39:39
Consider the demand high. :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:47:53
A vanity address is an address with a word in the front. Like 1Archive or 1HeroCC. A regular one is nothing special in the front
@_date: 2013-09-07 13:19:57
Good. Good for you iPhone Google auth users. Android authy user unaffected. :-)
EDIT: Woah, guys, I meant this as a joke. Sorry if I offended anybody. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:23:16
Yay! Thanks for your good deed!
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:59:15
Unfortunately, apple makes it hard to change. Your data is on an apple account. That is music, apps, email, etc. Currently, you need to restart everything (except for music, which can be transfered) if you get a new android. Everything would be new, and it is hard to migrate from apple to Android.
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:32:39
There was a technical discovery that allowed most android generated addresses to be hacked.
More info:
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:14:29
Good thinking but I don't think so. I use coinbase, but did not get the email.
EDIT: Yes, I checked my spam.
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:36:07
I bet people are using it as an alternative to Lavabit.
@_date: 2013-06-06 11:03:13
Nice idea!
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:52:21
Android planned?
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:56:05
Thermos? You mean theymos right?
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:20:10
Good idea, but I don't think he said he had a Voice account, or used it.
Correct me of I am wrong.

I praise thy, my lord!

*gets down on knees and begs like a dog*
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:26:27
It may probably be less, with this big rise in ASICs.
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:59:23
Yep,  there was just a post about it. Do not click the link. Good checking, though! 
@_date: 2013-08-14 01:47:58
People will stop mining, difficulty will drop, mining will become profitable again, and so on and so on.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:32:36
You better not be serious.
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:45:31
Sell it, there will always be someone willing to pick it up for a large price.
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:16:12
Oh, cool. Didn't know that. Thanks!
