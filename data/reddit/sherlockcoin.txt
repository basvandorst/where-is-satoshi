Counc copy? What s that?
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:24:41
maybe now it s time for nsa to hack bitcoin after the amount is transferred  
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:33:27
Oh, those crypto puns :))))
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:00:51
I assume you are talking about BankToTheFuture
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:03:00
Yep, true
@_date: 2016-08-28 21:32:47
oh damn... spoiler ... I was about to watch that and now... :(
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:59:42
Oh man, you should do a small ICO

I would love to see No Man's Sky Classic :)
@_date: 2016-08-21 14:55:50
Maybe ? Should I press the button ? :)
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:27:58
good point
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:25:58
Well, I didn't 
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:01:30
that looks like the non squeezed logo of ETC: 
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:52:42
@_date: 2016-08-26 20:05:15
That would be funny and sad...
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:37:48
Are they that bad at English or are they using a text generator programs to generate that stuff?
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:45:22
BitGo? Bleah...
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:45:01


I wonder if this is ever gonna happen... 
I understand, you have a point as they are trying to get some money first then fix things later especially in the indie game industry where money is missing ... anyway.. let's see... 
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:29:42
@_date: 2016-08-23 01:18:58
Ah, that s the one..
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:34:37


wow, how can that be? someone is station C listening ? I thought there are only 2 stations, A and B...
Still if you know that someone is listening you can stop the communication immediately and that's a real advantage over the current system
If what you are saying is true, why are they spending millions on this? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 22:47:29
I see...
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:09:53
i heard someone saying that NSA can hack Bitcoin..
@_date: 2016-08-21 17:28:01
Well, my point is they should remove this feature altogether... 
I don t think I actually want to try it..
@_date: 2016-08-16 10:20:51
paper wallet is secure! don't read all that BS about paper not being safe and about the fact that you have to move to hardware ... 
it 's not like a ninja will teleport in your room and steal your paper... 
alternatively you can put the paper in a water proof case or something or metal case in case it caches fire ... 
actually get a   , nothing is more save than crytosteel: stainless, waterproof, fireproof, shockproof ... and you can put the master seed inside yourself alone without anyone watching... what more do you want?
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:11:10
but he is talking about the NSA hack , you see? and he is scared that the hacker is gonna use the hacking tools to destroy Bitcoin when Bitcoin is the currency you have to pay for those tools... 
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:49:29
I heard they have super computers now... ( super popcorn )
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:37:11

sounds about right...
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:57:51
Yes, I understand it's fun but the developer lied saying it's multi-player when is not ... that was funny...
Also, I think Star Citizen has the same technology with procedural gen  planets and landscape and at the same time you can play it with your friends so I do agree with people saying it was over-hyped by tricky marketing techniques and maybe paying gamers to evangelize this stuff... I don't know , it feels kind of awkward that two industries (the digital asset industry and games) are using the same marketing techniques... but who knows.. maybe there is a trend here...
Also it is good for streaming (I heard) so , that's good... you should do that and get tips in Bitcoin ;)
Finally yes, one will die.. ETH or ETC ... we will see...
 
@_date: 2016-04-21 10:13:06
This goes back to the Genesis block... this is why Bitcoin was created.. to prevent prevent people like them to capture the entire world economy..

@_date: 2016-04-21 22:57:15

@_date: 2016-08-25 17:46:21
Well maybe by forcing you to upload a copy in your google drive, dropbox, icloud, backup whatever... you will need to use an old canon or nikon or something... i know this is improbable but i am just being the devil s advocate here
@_date: 2016-04-18 22:19:40

So , be honest, how much money did u spend to create the channel or whatever the name is and to make the payment and get the rest of the money out?
@_date: 2016-04-26 23:05:28
No because PoS can become a cartelle of people owning 99 % of all coins

@_date: 2018-09-11 19:25:24
You don't get it... if you look at the behavior patern of Bitmain, the whole thing looks like fiat money even if there is no force now...


So.. keep in mind , they are big ... sometimes the only place to go for mining gears ... they have a big market share goeing down a bit still... but for them to do that is nasty... it is as if if you want to get around in a green car you have to pay Tesla in their own PayPal like money because there are not that many other companies around or if not , then touch luck.. you need to spend 8 hours on a bycicle or quit life... it is good they are not doing that anymore...

@_date: 2015-06-18 21:54:23
Her argument is that we should use a IOU chain where the coins are IOUs because the $ is stable and Bitcoin is not and no one wants to hold the money in an unstable currency but the truth is Bitcoin is at the moment unstable because it's very small and it's a niche thing.. basically it's an egg and chicken problem... if she doesn't tell people to use it then it will never be stable in the first place because of leak of adoption ... 
In a similar way she is not aware of the fact that not everyone uses $ so you will still have a lot of friction between currencies and therefore a global currency like Bitcoin is better... 
TL;DR: bla bla bla buy Ripple , bla bla bla... 
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:38:54
then we should stop sending mining fees to them...

Collision are hard to find... I guess you need to use something simple like CRC32 (Cyclic redundancy check).
Example of CRC32 collision: 
     “plumless” -&gt; CRC -&gt; 0x4ddb0c25
 
     “buckeroo” -&gt; CRC -&gt; 0x4ddb0c25

Well you can't that's why only one vote per reddit user is allowed... 
Alternatively you can look at the number of coins (the wealthy bitcoiners will get more votes and it is kind of unfair) but it will be impractical for a user to shuffle the coins then vote again because the voting period will be over by then (it takes days for a good shuffle) and we can see if the coins are reused for a new vote without shuffling... 
In both cases generating vanity addresses takes time so this is another way to prevent spam...

After speaking with a friend of mine who is a greek leaving abroad it's all clear... 
The problem is , it doesn't matter how much money you have in your greek bank account and it doesn't matter where you have the money from ... you can only withdraw 60 Euro / day and it's difficult to find a ATM with cash in it and with no people queuing...  
The bottom line is they have no way of telling if the money you have is from abroad when all banks are closed so therefore you can't send money to greece as you would normally do ... 
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:53:25

and the 7th interview 1:49 is with *Marilyn Bochicchio* from **PayBefore** who is very skeptical about Bitcoin

So, they said the transaction is encrypted and Apple is not able to see it. That's good (but I am not 100% sure). However, if this thing is real then we can use apple pay for OTC bitcoin trade... That would be good for traders because they don t have to carry cash around...

Well, Bitcoin is not spending millions of dollar running campaigns either... there is no cost in creating a meme...
However, WU is spending thousands of $ paying lawyers, and one of those lawyers decided to take down some parody images... that is waist of money... the lawyer should focus on something else.. something more important or WU should spend less money on lawyers and reduce their fees on transfers (that will make everybody happy)... but instead they they prefer to invest in aggressive legal departments like this:

Possible ways: 
* ISP Ban port 8333 and eventually other ports used by BTC clients
* ISP Filter all websites hosting web wallets or client wallets
* ISP Create two lanes: the fast lane (with a range of white-listed websites) and the slow lane with everything else. This will affect torrents as well.
I am just saying, it is very unlikely but is possible...

What if some day in the far future everyone will start using BTC and the minners willmstop mining new coins at 21 million coins. Then no one will be able to use the Ponzi scheme argument. If that future will become reality Bitcoin would have reach it's full potential and no one will be unhappy.

The pre-mined stuff is by Satoshi and it is less than 10% 
soon when all the coins will be in the ecosystem that amount will be insignificant... 
compare that wiht 60~70 %.
please don't mistake this with the wealth distribution thing... that's a different story... 
plus the wealth distribution is semi public (like the Facebook guys , Tim Draper and it is likely to change trough stuff like auctions donations and stuff while pre-mined 60% is totally different. why would you want a company something Labs to own almost all the coins? it is like going to a bank and this is not the point of a peer to peer crypt currency.. 
PS: litecoin is not pre-mined either...

I would say: 
* 1) 51% of all bitcoin miners. 
Note: Estimate time is &lt;10 min because they need to reach consensus on whether to do it or not.
* 2) 1 banker.

The brain pass phrase is a set of 12 words from a special dictionary made in such a way so that you can convert that pass phrase into a working private key to unlock the coins . The coins are stored in the decentralized ledger called the blockchain and that ledger is owned by everyone including by yourself if you are running a full node on your computer. 
A brain wallet is similar to a real wallet in a way. If you forget where you left your wallet than your money is gone forever. Likewise if you forget your 12 words pass phrase , your coins are lost forever. The only difference is no one is able to steal your brain wallet from your brain unless that person is Leonardo DiCaprio (inception)

Well, people are doing BTC landing now on BTC-e. Basically, I lend 1 BTC and the trader will give me back 1.01 later on. 
The thing because the trader owns me bitcoin , if the price goes down too fast there is a Margin Stop Call algorithm in palace that will automatically sell that bitcoin to whatever price is there in the market to cover the loses. This is why we get the Margin Call Cascade effect. 
The market is possibly manipulated because some traders know when the Cascade effect will take place especially if they have inside information about this algorithm from the exchange itself. 
Nasdaq is using wide circuit barkers to avoid this:

Your idea is actually good if you own the domain. It is not a good idea to rely on coinbase because maybe tomorrow coinbase will be shut down by a government or hacker and so will be your ability to send or receive money. But if you have your own domain, like for example you go to **rotld.ro** and buy a Romanian domain, that domain is yours for life and you can actually create a subdomain called "btc". In that subdomain you can put a picture or something with your QR code. If the hosting company goes down you can immediately buy hosting somewhere else and re route your domain to the new hosting. 
Now, it should be a nice idea for everybody to start doing that in order to make *btc.doamin.com* ubiquitous just like *ftp.domain.com* 
The only problem is , ISP could censor your btc.domain.com address  or they can take your domain all together however I hope this will change in time with projects like namecoin and Ethereum. 
Meanwhile, go on and buy your domain it looks like it's free:
once you have your domain , buy hosting and then in the hosting control panel make your subdomain "btc"
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:27:00
Yes, why not? We can get full node consensus... Even if that is the case, there are other crypto currencies and I think that in the future half or a third of crypto transactions will be done trough altcoins...

What value because the *value* fluctuates... The reason why the value fluctuates so much is because (1) it is new , (2) it is so unusual and people are not use to it and people did not manage to give it a fixed value (or at least stable value) like gold... after thousands of years it is more or less stable... I am with you but unfortunately we will have to wait a few years until people like Peter will not be skeptical... 
PS: I agree with you it is better than gold due to transport of value ability and no middleman exchange but for now people in develop countries with stable currencies prefer fiat unless they have something to hedge the volatility... I am sore they will have something soon...

Error 522: 
A 522 error states that CloudFlare could not make a TCP connection to the origin server before the attempts timed out. This means that CloudFlare was unable to send the http request to the origin as no network connection to the origin server could be established.
Common reasons why this can occur include:
* Rate limiting incoming connections from CloudFlare's IPs.
* A process on the webserver is consuming all of one or more resources at the origin.
* The domain is on a shared hosting platform where traffic or tasks for a separate domain on the same server is taking up one or more resources.
* Network connectivity issues between CloudFlare and the origin web server.

* Nowadays, Switzerland the default financial haven and for that reason you can easily store your wealth in Bitcoin 
* You can pay for *naughty* things without your wife knowing if she is checking your bank statements
* If you want to go for holiday for example in Europe and you want to change $ for € for example you can save up to 10% if you use Bitcoin (if you know how to use it) so instead of 10 days of holiday you can enjoy 11 days
* Running a big corporation is sometimes difficult and if you use Bitcoin to cut out the 3% credit/debit card fees you can win the fight with the competition, kind of like Overstock.com

The standard transaction fee is 0.0001 BTC ( 1 / 10 000 of a Bitcoin ). 
That is 0.03 USD.
You can even transfer with 0 BTC fee but if you put 0 then you have to wait a little longer (sometimes 24 hours)... 
I never heard someone not being able to send with 0 BTC fee after trying several times...

So what can you do with the 24 gyft points you got from this ?
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:42:02
no problem, people are worried that if there are too many transaction in a  regular 10 min time span, the block size will become too big and therefore other problems like bandwith usage and huge block chain size (although when you download the blockchain you get it slitted in files and you can delete some of them to save space)

I would to like to add that you get to keep your account for free but some countries especially in Eastern Europe are charging a few hundred cents for managing your online banking account and sometimes for SEPA you have to pay 10~15 Euros. 
Finally you get to keep the plastic credit/debit card for 3~5 years until you have to go to the bank and pray for another card. 
With Bitcoin you get to keep your bitcoin account for ever!

* **Question 1**: What are the benefits of digital currencies? How significant are these benefits? How do these benefits fall to different groups e.g. consumers, businesses, government, the wider economy? How do these benefits vary according to different digital currencies?
* **Question 2**: Should the government intervene to support the development and usage of digital currencies and related businesses and technologies in the UK, or maintain the status quo? If the government were to intervene, what action should it take?
* **Question 3**: If the government were to regulate digital currencies, which types of digital currency should be covered? Should it create a bespoke regulatory regime, or regulate through an existing national, European or international regime? For each option: what are the advantages and disadvantages? What are the possible unintended consequences (for instance, creating a barrier to entry due to compliance costs)?
* **Question 4**: Are there currently barriers to digital currency businesses setting up in the UK? If so, what are they?
* **Question 5**: What are the potential benefits of this distributed ledger technology? How significant are these benefits?
* **Question 6**: What risks do digital currencies pose to users? How significant are these risks? How do these risks vary according to different digital currencies?
* **Question 7**: Should the government intervene to address these risks, or maintain the status quo? What are the outcomes of taking no action? Would the market be able to address these risks itself?
* **Question 8**: Should the government regulate digital currencies to protect users? If so, should it create a bespoke regime, or regulate through an existing national, European or international regime? For each option: what are the advantages and disadvantages? What are possible unintended consequences (for instance, creating a barrier to entry due to compliance costs)?

The site looks good but you need to finish a few things... I guess you know that already... 
A few things that I have noticed here so far (I can come back with more): 
* There is no QR code for bitcoin deposit. I want to deposit with my phone. 
* There are all those Alt Coins but for all of them you use acronyms. I want to see the long names of the coins as well so that I know what I am trading. 
* When depositing cryptocurrency it doesn't show how many confirmations I need to confirm, not even estimated time to wait.
* The font is toooo small... What if I am visually impaired?

**I disagree!**
* If **I want to read the news while walking on the street without(few) ads I buy FT**
* If I want to read the news with ads I read a tabloid
* If **I want to learn while walking the street without ads, I buy a book**
* If I want to learn with ads I read a magazine 
* If **I want to watch news without ads I watch BBC -- this is why I pay TV licence for or at least this is how it should be. Alternatively I can go to Cinema**
* If I want to watch TV with ads I can watch any whatever is on
Conclusion it should be the same for the internet. If I want to buy a product why do I need to see adverts when I am paying extra for the product? If I want to buy it and I am not sure why do I have to see adverts next to reviews when the reviews are payed (at least most of them). 
I will switch off the ad blocker for Reddit and other sites that deserve this and have not other ways to support their business model.

Mr Peter Schiff, you use Bitcoin because when you are receiving payments with BTC there is less friction then Visa/MasterCard ergo **Bitcoin has value**. 
You say Bitcoin has **no intrinsic value** but, right now **you are actively PROFITING from this intrinsic value**! 
I hope you understand now that this is what Bitcoin is all about.
Gold is also method of storing value and trading goods but unless you invent a method of transferring gold trough cable or air it is not that efficient.

The discussion is off track now. 
First Meta is NOT a BTC exchange. They introduced Bitcoin as a method for buying Game Tokens but no service for converting Tokens into Btc. Therefore technically is not a Bitcoin exchange. If you want, First Meta is a Second Life Linden Dollar buying service with Btc and GoCoin was the third party company. So, the title is misleading. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:27:09
no, there is no need for that as long as you have a computer. 
You can still receive bitcoin from someone with a smart code if you show a Bitcoin QR code on your phone display even if is black and white screen (QR code is like a bar code with squares instead of bars). 
You can even print that qr code on a t shirt and walk on the street like that... if for some reason you look like someone who needs to be tipped and if there are bitcoiners around people will tip you with their smart phones

Generate 3 Bitcoin keys for example, put them here:

This *new* thing they do with Margin Trading and so on is to increase liquidity in the market but if they don't make safeguards, like special algorithms like [Nasdaq CircuitBreaker]( then this is all for nothing. 
In reality, this service is making market way too unstable and people will choose to stay away from Bitcoin including new potential adopters. In the long run, this will harm the bitcoin ecosystem.

The common criticism is Ethereum is not finished... they have a lot of money and still the project is not finished and it should be finished by now... 
What I know is the project works exactly like that (and I even seen examples of a decentralized crowd fund system) , what I don t know is why it is taking so long for them to finish it... 
Other common criticism ? I don t know... I don't pay to much attention... I guess, some people are afraid that the evil people from the bank sector will do something evil to Ethereum. Somehow it is weird that a lot of developers are working in cubicles and accelerator spaces sponsored by the banks which is very strange... 
Other than that I suggest you download the Beta client and test a contract yourself or go to a meetup.

I don't think the Daily Mail reporters are that stupid. I would like to quote from their article: 


They should have said virtual currencies such as Linden Dollars from the troubled game Second Life. 
All articles about this suicide case have a mistrust way of presenting the story as if she was killed by some assassin or group of criminals in order to get the coins. They want to make people believe that hackers progressed to the point of real violence so that they can reach a bigger audience , e.g.: people with no interest in what's going on in the digital world but sensitive to others real misfortunes...

It is in our nature for humans to explore and to go into new territories and it is very likely that in hundreds, maybe thousands of years this planet will have it's own global currency and so the rest of the colonised planets.

He should apologize, He said Bitcoin/bitcoin is a bubble this includes all other products that are made using this technology or a similar technology including social networks like twister and smart contract systems like etherium. 


I agree with jotaroh that he should apologize because when he made fun of this he also made fun of all the crypto space , crypo social networks, crypto contracts and all people involved into this saying that he is smart and we know nothing. 
When you say Linux is a tulip you also say that all the developers that spend thousands of hours building it are stupid and you don't say that especially when you **use** Linux.

Hello dalovin, 
you should check . They have the answer to your question. 


Exactly, with Ethereum, you can call APIs. Of course one API is not enough but a *basket* of APIs will be enough. Let's say for example you want to make a bet about the weather. If that is the case you make a basket and you put Yahoo Weather, BBC Weather and so on and you use in the bet for temperature for example the average of all temperatures. Additionally you can use agents with reputation ( entities with different types of baskets ). If the bet is small enough, it will be economically non feasible to build fake reputation. Finally with the perfect balance between incentives, the future contract will become unbreakable.  
In the same way with Ethereum, you can build decentralized crowd funding systems. Here you need no APIs or agents. You simply put a if else statement in the contract. 
How about that?
@_date: 2014-11-25 23:16:03
You are right, however, it is really unfair, they have Millions , perhaps BILLIONS $ to spend for advertising and because of that they can easily manipulate the public opinion to think they are the best... 
Unfortunately in the Bitcoin space, there is no budget for advertising and because of that, the battle is like the battle between a ‎light heavyweight and a super heavyweight boxer.... Not really fair, isn't it?!

In my opinion the current Bitcoin Block chain can work well for at least 10 more year with some improvements like pruning and a little increase in max block size. After 10 years i dont know

@_date: 2017-02-24 17:27:28
I think this is a very degraded way to see things... *the economy is infinite*
depending on what you mean by the economy things are a bit more complicated
like for example someone might say the number of goods on this planet is growing to infinity but at the same time a different person like an activist (eco activist) might tell you it is not. From plastic bags to phones and cars... there is no way this will keep on growing. I can make the same argument for services but maybe this can be different depending on your definition of services. 
If you view the economy as an abstract system then indeed is kind of infinite but then again there are other cryptocurrencies not to mention the divisibility of bitcoin.
So it's just propaganda... not telling the whole picture..

plus bitcoin is world wide... FEDcoin is only for US...
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:09:51
I don't know... maybe there are some crazy trading bots ( Trading Bots gone Crazy)... 
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:35:44
Maybe this is what they want... the VIPs ... they want media attention... ;)
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:04:30
Yes, you are right... this devaluing is more like a tax for keeping the network secure..
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:16:52

in order to buy on local bitcoins... yes it makes sense...
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:51:15
look , another one: 
wdf?!... this is stupid... why not making all the blocks 0 transactions ... then they cannot sell the cons because it is impossible to make transactions... 
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:25:58
Oh, than you for posting... if you have anything else -- imgs etc feel free to post 500 bits

Hmmm, interesting... I would like to know more about those naughty bots / scripts ... 
maybe they deleted because it was full of mistakes ( spelling mistakes and wrong figures ) ... that's more plausible... 
Any way...

I think the best solution is for the gov to make them innovate... just force them to innovate ASAP
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:40:02
So the crime was fake: 


PS: this looks like an episode from Braking Bad. 
*Hank then shows a fake picture of Jesse dead on the floor with his brains blown out, which causes Huell to panic and say that he doesn't have any intel about Walt's actions.*

What do you want to tell them?
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:40:17
So, in an Orwellian 1984 like society , you could work for the goverment to convince the majority thet 2 + 2 = 5 ...

ohhh... that's gonna be hard...
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:23:56


Yes, they do BTC articles from time to time... 
I am surprised they said nothing about the low price... 
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:45:36
well, try focusing on top 10 exchanges from this lost apart from local bitcoins : 
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:47:44
thank you
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:02:31
why not? maybe the same people *taking care* of the RUB are *taking care* of BTC... maybe they have something new on their agenda... it is possible...

@_date: 2015-01-04 15:06:15
Yes but it makes no sense to immediately sell... it makes sense to hold 
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:26:43

Here is an interesting one for you : 
"Bitcoin Price" VS "Blockchain" 
It looks like the blockchain technology or the world wide ledger or whatever it is in people's mind is more important than the price itself nowadays... it is ironic...

@_date: 2015-01-20 14:24:09

I was looking at the RUB price ( the raise its in interest rate to 17 percent from 10.5% was for nothing )
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:18:01
yep, this is what I am saying... 
it is not like the down cycle will gonna happen everywhere and people will use bitcoin to convert assets they no-longer need in other assets or keep BTC if necessary 
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:21:50
even if you change your nationality ?
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:08:37
wow, a gun ?!
I thought it's something else ... like a phone case or something.. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:31:17
The only good news is I no longer see big volumes on Bitstamp (like thousands of coins per minute...)
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:58:46
that's Adam in a nutshell ;)
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:20:47

RemindMe! one week. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:31:11
any reply?
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:18:36
yes, true... is like you are shooting yourself in the foot if you are a miner and you sell all at once... 
not to mention the increase in difficulty... 
it looks to me like whoever said bitcoin is the worst asset of the year or something like that bought a lot of mining equipment gears made some coins and crashed the price to make it look like the worst asset of the year...   
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:24:34
Well, what is it? someone must tell us...
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:01:00
Oh, what I wanted to write is: "Who pays for this crap"...
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:59:31
one of them is Adam Guerbuez :)
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:45:20


a few decades... I wouldn't say for *sooo long*... 
plus the culture can be changed trough education...
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:48:20
They are using the same strategy:  (terror / porn)
@_date: 2015-01-19 10:41:57
I hope Ego pay will come back
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:43:48
I just want home mineing again... this is unfair... we should boicot the pool..
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:45:19
Intresting.. let's see how it goes... so far not good
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:08:02
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:26:54
wow... do you actually know their names?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:21:36
and buy the 19k coins from local bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:19:10
oh, it's sound like i am getting some coins after all from gox... 
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:46:01
So , if I don't see a few Peta Hashes drop on the graph it means they are lying ... 
I will keep my eye on

@_date: 2015-01-26 00:36:00
I wish people would give me bits whenever I see people saying I wish people would give me bitcoins.

Nice one... I would like to have some crypto to tip other people because I am out of coins :( ... or maybe I have some coins but I don't know how to see how much I have...
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:23:31
Yes.. let's see.. i don t think they care about mining themselves... too risky 4 them
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:23:41
It looks like I was right my friend: 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:12:32
This reminds me of the Mastercard guy: 
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:21:29


There is a theory that big miners with a very effective and energy efficient mining equipment are selling in order to get rid of the competition (other miners that are forced to shut down switch off)... 
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:33:18
Bitcoin wisdom is not working... do you know any working chart?
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:42:07
who is this in the picture? Mark Karpeles?
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:17:39
I don't know... this is what it says in the youtube description: "D Movie"

@_date: 2015-01-15 15:26:14
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:06:53
I know but it would be nice to coordinate and do it all at once... in that case the price will stay at  for at least a few hours...
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:56:39
So , do you think it is their strategy to take out the competition?
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:56:32
Please do not throw stones at this... it's just a thought... what would happen and how could it be done? 
@_date: 2015-05-14 13:54:49
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:06:17

What's **citizenship based taxation**?
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:53:14
They are keeping 75% so people will go for the other competitor who is keeping less
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:25:55
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:10:56
A system with front door for spy agencies is by definition a less secure system.

I don't understand why I get down-voted... 
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:59:11
well, i think Circle or something is next ... but again ... is just my feeling
@_date: 2015-01-27 07:23:50
The Bitcoin price will go up to 400 , maibe 401 but only for a few minutes than back to 250.

Well, there are many theories... for example, a lot of Bitcoin Cloud mining website are closing down and now they are selling to get as much money as possible. 
Bad news like coinbase is not actually regulated and some terrorist stuff.
People are afraid the market is gonna go below 200 and therefore are afraid to invest again...

yes but if the price of bitcoin goes less than $200 and to my knowledge that's the lowest price per bitcoin is profitable with the current technology then selling a lot of them and making the price go close to $200 ( now 250 ) is like shooting yourself in the foot...
it is not rational at all..

Apple's iMessage and FaceTime and also Telegram encrypt their data, and could fall under the ban.

Well, I was thinking that the owners of the mining farms in China and so on have more brains... they can hold on to the coins instead of dumping them... this behavior is more profitable than what you are saying...

Well, when you have a message on your phone and you encrypt the message for the other phone (the receiver) to decrypt it the communication is safe. However, if you encrypt the message so that only the receiver can decrypt it AND a spy agency (in case of  emergency, and stuff as they want) then you have to ways of deciphering the message therefore the communication is less safe. This is what is called a front door in the encryption. 
What I don't understand is, do they want a front door for Obama and another one for Cameron or can they use the same front door?

exactly... no one writes journals by hand nowadays... just digital...
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:22:51
yes , something like that... 
plus , think about it ... if there is a special key for decryption the message owned by the US spy agencies and another one owned by the British spy agencies... then all countries will start asking for decryption keys and then if one of those keys become public than all your communication is compromised...

It is important to understand that an object (or some other complex thing, like money) that s not fizical (not present in the physical world) is not  ecceserely virtual. 
For example, if you have a cheap way of printing 3 objects and you want to print a lamp, you use a digital file ( like a digital lamp ). Considering you have a cheap PLA fioler and a cheap wire and a lighbolb you end up with a cheaper lamp than IKEA. Therefore if you own a digital lamp is better than owning a virtual lamp in Second Life by making your life easier. 
Same way with having a digital identity. One thing is to own you digital identity thing a tottaly different to own a virtual hero with a virtual identity associated to it.
It goes the same with digital images and images rendered by virtual rendering software. 
Not to mention the definition of money (what you need for it to work) : means of payment, unit of account, and store of... etc... Therefore , Bitcoin is more close to currency than the dollar from Second Life. It's more like synthetic money, not virtual money. 
In a nutshell, Bitcoin is digital currency.

plus the doubling of the block size is a linear scaling solution whereas bitcoin core can increase to infinity using a second layer... 
what do you want , linear scaling solutions or exponential growth ?

CRYPTOCURRENCIES &amp; MINING ARE LIKELY TO MOVE INTO CORPORATE BANKING.
 
1. In the 1970s the home computer was used mostly by home hobbyists. 
2. In the 1980s the home computer moved into corporate banking. 
3. We will likely see a similar movement of cryptocurrencies and mining from the home hobbyist to the corporate banking environment in 10 years.
WE ARE NOT NEAR A TOP IN BITCOIN
1. In 2013, the Bitcoin top was created by spectators and not the market makers.
2. The 2013 Bitcoin price top was engineered by the market makers in a mark-up accumulation strategy.
3. 2013 was not the right time for a Bitcoin top.
BITCOIN TRADING
1. Don’t try to time the bottoms and the tops in price movements. 
2. Focus on the middle part of price movements. 
3. Treat your Bitcoin trading like a business.

The fact that he is using tulips (ergo Bitcoins) he makes the price of tulips even higher because duhhh... he is using this thing... 
A vertical person will never do that. He said it is dangereus and he advised everyone from the precious metal space not to *touch* this thing called bitcoin and yet ... he is touching it... This is disgusting... 
A person with integrity will never do that because as a person who is writing books and who is leading the public opinion he should be consistent.

It is more like the reduction of information stored in a block while keeping the essential data to make it work correctly and to allow in essence more transactions per block. To me that s like making everything more eficient just like compression ( at least lossless compression )

So far I was able to check an older Gab homepage and it dosn't look like there is any hate speech whatsoever... 
There is even someone quoting from the Bible : 


That look very peaceful to me... 
I don't understand why someone would wanna ban a website where you can read quotes from the Bible...

You are missing a point... 
Stable coins are just a trend now because there is a lot of distrust in Tether at the moment and some rich people are smelling blood in the water.
The idea is paper money or gold money was first **unconfiscatable**, **unstoppable** and  **uncensurable** until bankers invented the current banking system (see the scandal with wikileaks loosing banking services and paypal).
Now the value proposition of a stable coin crafted let's say on top of Ethereum is the coin/token itself is unconfiscatable, unstoppable and uncensurable but only if you don't move whatever you have in fiat money because once you do that the bankers can censure you again. 
You might encounter other problems like for example them not having enough fiat money to back that stable coin but let us assume that's not an issue.
Now if a stable coin like USDT becomes the de facto currency, we win because it is more or less unconfiscatable, unstoppable and uncensorable... this is what we wanted isn't it? If Bitcoin becomes the de facto currency we also win because Bitcoin is even more unconiscatable, unstoppable and uncensorable.
The only problem is, fiat money tend to loose purchasing power due to inflation / hyperinflation so if something is pegged to fiat then what happens if that fiat becomes worthless? It is more likely that USD or any other fiat currency like the Venezuelan Bulevard will go to near zero than Bitcoin because Bitcoin is scarce sound money. Plus Bitcoin is global whereas USD or EUR or any other let us say JPY they are all local (nationwide) currencies. If something is global the chance of that thing to disappear is lower.
USDC is like Paypal internal money units: Paypal was great at the beginning but today is terrible (I am planning to delete my paypal account this week).

The fluctuation in price , as in volatility is actually going down... in time Bitcoin will be more stable than every currency with medium monetary supply (btc is already more stable then the Venezuelan B) and in time bitcoin will be more stable than even USD or EUR by the looks of it.

Well, what it appears to me is the fact that Twitter and Facebook are trying to remove the competition, which in this case is Gab. The same man who posted on Gab posted also on Facebook and Twitter and yet Facebook still receives money and Twitter still receives money from users whereas Gab is not able to because of Stripe and PayPal ban... This is what happened with Wiki Leaks... 
Now if your argument is Gab is a platform for hate speech you have to give me proof like real verifiable statistics otherwise I don't believe you...

It is not a product but a service and the service is sending money around, probably from one currency to another.. People have the right to know about how it works (how they claim it works) as in $ to BTC to € . Essentially by moving away from BTC they are harming the Bitcoin ecosystem and potentially the non BTC customers as well. Not to mention that it is not ethical to use an entire community to boost your service / product then on day dump everyone.

That's kind of like an oxymoron... if the smart contract is truly decentralized then the smart contract can only work as programmed and cannot moderate violent speech... 
If the smart contract can moderate trough deep learning then it is not a real smart contract and therefore it is not decentralized...

A nazi style system is bad but something like an extreme form of communism is also bad, don't forget that... 
In the event that the world will end up being ruled by a crazy guy like Kim Jong Un, we want people to be able to talk to each other on websites or blockchain based systems so therefore we don't want websites to be removed from the face of the Internet just like that without a proper trial and without a proper investigation.
Gab said right from the beginning, they are a platform, not a publishing newspaper type of website... therefore they should not be held accountable for what people write on their website... plus they don't have money to integrate the most complex and the most expensive AI algorithm to filter content... 
If you have to start your own social media platform with the most expensive AI system in the world from day one you are not gonna make the new Facebook isn't it... Don't you want to see a new social network platform or you love the old dusty facebook interface too much?

Well, it is well known in your own filter bubble... ( see :  ).
Trust me, the filter bubble is a real thing... I know this because I am a dev... Check my replies to and if you don't believe I'm a dev... 
All what you see in your every day google search is different then if you use a brand new laptop with brand new Internet connection.
Now in regards to Gab, I happen to know a person who leaves in NY who is pretty much the definition of a leftist and she was asking me how to get rid of her Facebook account and join wither Gab or Minds or something blockchain based because she was upset of Facebook selling data and so on... She said she likes Gab because of some religious groups there ( I forgot to say that she is not only leftist but christian leftist ).
So, if you don't have proper statistics then you can't really and you live in a filter bubble you can't really say for sure GAB is a far right platform because mathematically speaking you don't have the data to prove that...
 
If you remove GAB from the face of the normal Internet by telling GoDaddy to shut it down and telling paypal and stripe to also shut it down you remove the chance for a christian girl to find her peers... is that what you want? You want people to stop talking about their religion on websites? Is that what you want to do because you are somehow afraid of some people pushing some keys on keyboards? Now only that but as I said , new websites can't afford expensive AI so by definition if you don't allow new websites to grow you don't allow innovation... is that what you want, a world without innovation because you are, again afraid of some people writing stuff online? If you don't want innovation why maybe you should just go back using your old fax machine...
PS: Feel free to look at snapshots of Gab to see if I am right or wrong:  , search for Gab popular or something.

So what? it's enough to run a gov.. because it's a big number and that s a bit amount of money.. what do you want 100% of the population to pay taxes? as long as the gov doesn't have a transparent way to show the money-flow I agree with anyone not feeling comfortable paying taxes... plus , why do you need so much money as a gov? do you want to go to war or something?


still a big number... maybe he s counting the ones that are not being reported correctly but anyway, i am sure soon the number will be bigger


i don t know

Yes, all the advantages like banks don't want cash but to be honest let's wait and see the day when banks will be hacked weekly or get attacked with bit lockers then it makes more sense to have cash in vaults because there is so much a burglar can carry...

You can create 2 symbolic links in:
For example, in my case I have this \(this is from `ls -a`\) 
`blocks -&gt; /mnt/whatever/bitcoin/blocks/`
`chainstate -&gt; /mnt/whatever/bitcoin/chainstate/`
I have auto mount done with gnome\-disk but in your case you can use /media/whatever/Blockchain
so , navigate to `/home/username/.bitcoin`
and execute
`ln -s /whatever/whatever/bitcoin/blocks/`
`ln -s /whatever/whatever/bitcoin/chainstate/`
This will create some sort of symbolic virtual folder that links you to whatever.. that symbolic link should be persistent and should appear after you restart ... if it doesn't you might want to try the /mnt thing [with automount](
Once you do all of that you don t need to run \-datadir anymore because and just keep the default
If you are struggling you can always prune your node with **prune=999** in **bitcoin.conf** so that you consume only 1 gigabyte of data in your virtual machine and keep it all in there... \(you need to do backups of course...\)

You are comparing two different thing here the you should not be compared in this way... 
If all the cables are under ground and all the nodes are insider private buildings everything is secured but once you did underground or get yourself inside a building or whatever then nothing is secured anymore... 
With Bitcoin you can replace a mining farm with your own or a dozing but still is not enough because you will end up out of resources... 
You are comparing physical security with the security provided by a huge ecosystem highly decentralized and always evolving that no one can keep up with...

Read this article : 
"Intrachain" is a joke.. It is like how companies use the intranet instead of the Internet and at the end of the day they end up using the Internet a anyway trough services like drop box and Google docs. 
Soon they will start using a global coin (whatever that global currency is gonna be) rather than citi coin) because it is much more easy... 
I think we are at the beginning of something and the definition  of what is the block chain is not clear and therefore we SHOULD make up words. 
For what I know even if you have a small JSON object with information about Alice and Bob you can put that in a hash and by doing you basically put that in a block and after ten minutes you make another object and another block connected to the previous one. You can do that using 2 computers inside your company or bank and depending on how well your security is your little ecosystem is gonna be secured but the technology blockchain was not designed to be used in that way and it is ridiculous... 
Basically intranet blockchain is secured by force and bitcoin is set used by many other things... just to name a few keywords to give you an idea: game theory,  free market price discovery, advancement in Asic chip fabrication (never i have seen a technology growing so fast), cooling, VPN private connectivity and so on...
All what I said makes the bitcoin ecosystem gargantuous and strong...  that s why I want to have a different word for banks to show the distinction between the Big Bitcoin Blockchain and some possibly unsecured or not so secured tiny shiti block chain.

The only diff is Ripple has two many army members .. they al tend to vanish after they buy a lambo or after they loose and get salty.. Bitcoin on the othe hand is used and carried on by people even when the market is down.. Bitcoin is the honeybadger.. the two Bitcoin and Xrp will coexist indeed for a few years but I don't see Xrp surviving as there are toooi many compeating projects like Stable Coin X Y Z and Dai and Bank Coin X Y Z... damn even Bitcoin layer two could be adopted by banks instead of XRP... bitcoin is unique because of the network effect , the degree of decentralisation and calibre of developers . Full stop.

The utility goes to zero if Ripple starts printing trillions.. Read the what's written in the genesis block of Bitcoin: Chancelor on the virge of second bailout.. Read "the Bitcoin Standard" . Bitcoin is hard money because it is super hard to produce more of it and therefore stability and utility will come after that soon.. the important part is not the utility now, that part will come later

If they are non-custodial why do they need to know who everything is ... as long as I can sign the transaction off-line if [Blockchain.info]( is down, no one can force me to de anonim myself... if users loose private keys or password is their fault, it is like loosing some fiat paper money on the street, do I have to write my name on that piece of paper?

a very short block time (like for example a few seconds block time) ends up producing a lot of orphan blocks , see Ethereum and unless you a small reward for miners that do orphans from time to time it's gonna be an unfair system. On the other hand it's not good if you have too many orphans and it is very hard to balance the right amount of incentivization for everyone... In my opinion the block time should be a few minutes at least to avoid orphan blocks...

Correct, it was a smart contract keeping mappings of various tokens ... basically all the tokens under the Sun... In a way you can argue that he  wasn't obliged to file any papers at the beginning because how can one know in advance what tokens will be deposited in the smart contract by the users and plus one can argue that he wasn't in control of the smart contract...

Really? Ethereum is so secured that every now and then if forks into two networks... 
Any way, jokes aside... 
The uncle reward thing for orphans is a cool thing but no one is sure  the small uncle incentive is enough .. this project is new and we never tested properly like really use the network like crazy and ddos the network occasionally ... check out older posts how many times bitcoin was DDoSed back in the day when almost no one was running nodes think about what would happen if the number of orphan blocks really start to increase for things like ddos or changes in firewalls and stuff... you can's really say for certainty that this system is 100% bullet proof...

yes, you can co sign transactions or something like that with no proof of work but then you don't need blocks , you can just continuously co sign ... 
I don't see how a non proof of work network where a bunch of transactions are not bundled in a block is less secured then a non proof of work network where they are bundled so why not dropping this concept of blocks all together and then you have a *chain*

So what? So what you have entire warehouses full of ASICs? That's nothing compared to how many buildings banks have that include electricity, gas, food, guns, ammunition, building materials, paper and plastic. What Bitcoin is using at the moment is nothing if you compare to that. 
The blockchain has a big potential, I agree but don't forget that security is the number 1 most important aspect of Bitcoin. Without that you can't run assets or other stuff like that on top of it. The number one application "the currency" has to be big enough for miners to keep on mining. You can't pay a miner with some LTB or Swarm or FoldingCoin for his or her effort of running and mentioning the mining rig for safety because then the process of is too complicated for the miner. It would be nice but there is no good model now for doing that...

Maybe... 
the problem with mining is the fact that almost all the mining is done in China. I don't have statistics to back up this affirmation but it makes sense because the electricity there is subsidised by the Chinese Government. Other Goverment should subsidise electricity so that we can get more mining farms in more countries. Luckily there are places like Iceland with geothermal power. 
I know what you want, you want regular people like consumers to be able to mine as well but maybe in the future someone will make a heater or something with two functions like heating and mining. That will solve the problem.

1000 bits .  Now you have money to give away. What about that?
Well, that's the idea.. I see a lot of people tipping and I see no reason why they should not tip bloggers, vlogers and so on trough a system like ProTip. 
Unlike *ChangeTip* this extension is open source and it does not contain tracking scripts and stuff like that...
If you like a blog like Zerohedge (not that I like ZH but this is the first example that comes to my mind) and you want to support them by paying 1 bit every week (let's say they have a QR code on the page somewhere) you can do that with ProTip. Otherwise you have to disable the AdBlocker, read the article and then click some banners on their website to indirectly give them some money... if you know what I mean...

@_date: 2015-09-10 18:42:11
Despite the fact that this idea looks completely different than what Bitcoin is, I think we can learn something here:
This solution can scale almost endlessly because the main idea is to *divide up the space of possible transaction identifiers*, so that each mintette (here miner) is responsible for some *subset*. One subset can be controlled by ten, hundreds of miners to avoid bad behavior. 
So basically, in other words, in bitcoin if the hash of your transaction is lower than a number and higher than another number then a specific group of miners will take that transaction and therefore the entire network can scale up to more than 7 tps. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:23:06

the thing is ... if you look at their jobs: [ they are looking for people to help them with their mining equipment.. 
so basically their main interest is to get as many coins as possible , hence the name of the project *21e06* ... 
no, it doesn't make sense to build mining equipment to mine against them to decrease their revenue... unless they keep a small part of the coins somehow... 
either when you use the 21 shop or when you use their pool ... if somehow they force you to use their pool and let's say the product becomes spread world wide then if they do something bad , everyone is gonna be affected... 
something doesn't add up..

Everyone is nuts and you are the only person OK in this story isn't it?
It is not my problem fees are *insanely* high... that's a lame excuse... 
and yes... we are trying to make our own system of money here, and it is much more effective than yours ... this system is called Bitcoin and banks are trying to copy it, e.g: Citi Coin and so on... 
If you had so many problems with clients you should have invented a system like Bitcoin a long time ago... if you don't like people queuing just to something and stop being lame...

also what if the protocol requires that you 'mine' a certain hash... some sort of hash that looks like the subset that you want to go for... something like proof of tx... or maybe use something scarce like ip addresses or hashes of ip addresses...

The fact that you pay upfront everything you would like to buy in a month it's ok because it gives reassurance to the merchant that you are really serious... 
However, I am sure a merchant will be kind to refund you if you change your mind... after all this is why we have costumer protection and stuff...

What happened in Cyprus can happen with your money. The only difference is the costs for transacting are lower and the network is more resistant against DDoS attacks.

What about that?
By the way , Bitcoin is e-cash... **Read the white paper**!
How many time have you lost cash? How many times have you been compensated?
To be honest I don't want to pay all my existence for security and the possibility to get compensation when I can protect my cash or e-cash myself as I want ... This is why they get so big because people irresponsible like you...

yes you can send the money back to the tippers but then it is not good for the person who puts the image up... 
if you have a hi res image and you have a not so pixelated image final image you can get your money back and still see the image so it is not ok for the person who uploads the image.. 
likewise if the image is a joke then you loose money for nothing trying to see the image... 
best to let the user decide i guess or a jury... 
finally you should also set up a way to upload a sample...

is not a hash of Sartre , it s simply a piece of data from the blockchain... 
using a piece of data from a block to show that the result (the signed message) is another piece of data from the blockchain is not proving anything...

**tl;dr** : Bitcoin is a tulip mania. Bitcoin is created by an anonymous hacker and why should people trust a hacker more than the state? Some people say they are unhappy with the banking system but still, they should not go into Bitcoin. Also it is true that Mastercard and Visa charge too much for their services but still they should trust them more than some anonymous hacker.

Well look at this quote: 


I think IBM will build let's say the new fiber optic cables and everything and I think every commercial bank will be required to have a special computer that is both a node and a miner. At the same time there will be no reward whatsoever.  
The central bank, however will become the entity that is allowed to push for new software updates like a new elliptic curve algorithms for signing transactions or stuff like that.
In this way if a hacker get's access to one of the hidden cables buried by IBM it will be very difficult to DDoS the network or fork the blockchain... 
I think this is the plan...

Well it's a joke...  asically in the context of banks haiting the word Bitcoin and investing in Blockchain Consultancy Companies... and in the context that bitcoin IS in fact a Blockchain the joke is we should rename to blockchain shares

Yes, and this is why BS is short for Blockchain Shares because it's a joke... it is just trolling... 
Interesting fact, the last Bitcoin Meetup I went to there were more bankers than programmers and one banker didn't even wanted to open iTunes and install a Bitcoin wallet but had no problem accepting a paper wallet (maybe because of fear of being tracked). 
The banker was from the same bank that is currently investing millions in 'blockchain tech' but it looks like bankers know nothing... they are not telling anything to their employees... this is why I think it's funny to give a banker a blockchain share and than say 'haha you have bitcoin now' :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:51:34
Yes, I know... this wallet that I made as and example is not secured but if I make a rush wallet to you with some bits in it I can say to you *use it and see how it goes and don't put too much in it*. 
Then when you are serious about it i can give you a hardware wallet or something... 
I mean if it's a wallet made by someone else it goes without saying that it is not a wallet that you can trust... even if you are a noob... 
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:07:50
yes that s true... 
i bet they will invest in blockchain startups and blockchain consultancy companies as much as they can until they will invest too much...

@_date: 2017-07-31 07:59:32
Yes, good question...
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:51:16
Yeah, why?
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:15:03
not really... there are more factors... if you look at google trends you will see that the "bitcoin" trend is cyclical... I believe that in a few years we will see another *Cyprus moment* and people will revert to Bitcoin... I do believe that it will happen soon because there is too much greed in the banking industry and where there is greed there is fraud so the Selling Proposition for Bitcoin is use it when you are tired of all the others... 
Finally if you want to think in this analogy the profit is the reward and collection of fees but maybe in the future companies with digital assets on the bitcoin blockchain will start giving incentives to the miners in other ways as well..

Simple. If they had one Bitcoin , from you , why would they keep that coin instead of spending it to buy 2 Ant Mining rigs for you to pay you back ROI? A normal mining company would not have so much digital cash at hand. It is good to keep some coins but not that many. It sounds like there was a ponzy scheme and the new investers were payed from th old investers $. Thay got hacked or they are exiting.

Well you know, this is a network and it needs to grow in order to be feasible (in order to compensate for the inflation and keep steady price for example. 
That being said I agree with you but my point is, where are the big announcement from Spotifiy and Microsoft?
They are obviously doing beta-testing but come on... Bitcoin is easy to implement...
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:14:40
Has anyone tested yet? Is it cheaper to pay in BTC?

Owner gets 1$ from Alice with the promise that he will give her 2$ later on. Owner gets 1$ from Bob and gives back go Alice 2$ back. 
**That is called a Ponzi Scheme. **
Owner gets the equivalent of 1 BTC in HKD from Alice and the same amount from Bob. Owner gives Alice 2 BTC. 
**That is called also a Ponzi Scheme. **
Whey do they need to ban Bitcoin?

This is the original advert (not the one with the balloons): 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:16:44
It's kind of an 51% attac. Just done different ?!
No. 
If 50% of the miners go offline we will have to wait instead of ~10min for a block 20min for 4 weeks until the difficulty gets readjusted in the ecosystem (after 2016 blocks generated). 
If 99% of them then we have to wait ~100 x 10 min min and then is back to normal. 
If they go offline 99% of them and back online almost immateriality after then nothing happens.
If they go offline and come back later after the difficulty readjustment then we will only need to wait 0.14 days for the next difficulty readjustment... (that s gonna be the day where the bitcoin network will be super fast like lithcoin)...

Yes, we need a consensus... I would say to name mobile web or desktop wallet "Blockchain Shares Wallet" or "BS Manager" or something and name the coin Blockchain Shares. We can say that in the future you can buy all the 21M shares but for now not you can own only 17M or so...  


I think BS is the best option because then you can make jokes like: "Talk BS" , "are you full of BS" and so on... 
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:03:11
Just go to  and type:
      replaced = $("body").html().replace(/Bitcoin/g, "Blockchain Shares").replace(/฿/g, "BS"); $("body").html(replaced);

It looks like there **are** moments with 0 activity on Bitfinex... however, we should all take in consideration the price on LocalBitcoins. It is unfair to index the price based on the trading on those websites... They don t reflect the real market 100%

Well , i don t think anyone on local bitcoin uses any othar formula for their ads other than the default authomatic formula and that formula is based on bitstamp and since bitstamp (along with bitfinex and okc and houibo) is manipulated i don t think is fair.. 
Long story short , the ecosystem is decentralised but the price is not
