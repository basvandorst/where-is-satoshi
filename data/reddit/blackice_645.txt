I remember about 6-8 months ago, someone on here posted that the only thing that could stop bitcoin would be a G20 summit proposal, and every country getting behind it in a coordinated attack to stop bitcoin.  He thought at that time it would be really unlikely bitcoin would be that popular, and yet here we are.  The fact that theres a regulation proposal put out by countries at a G20 summit makes this a little bit bigger than a fucking tulip.

The fact no one can predict WHEN it will crash leads to the belief that there is no knowledge behind the speculation that this is a bubble.      So again, what is it specifically, that makes bitcoin a bubble?  We know that the US dollar isn't able to be backed by gold, which inherently is only valuable because its rare.  Bitcoin in itself is also rare, so what makes this a bubble?

I'm all for healthy criticism of investments.  1.  This guy is a writer by trade and education.  2.  He is just screaming "its a bubble!!!" yet gives no facts to back up his claims.  Everyone that says "its a bubble!" has yet to give a factual basis for why its a bubble.  Everyone on the pro side of bitcoin has a very good explanation for why blockchain tech works, yet no one is available on the other side to refute those claims of value.  Additionally, everyone who states "its a bubble, get out now!" does not include one important variable, time.  They never say when the bubble will pop, or why.  I remember last month one redditor stated "get out, bitcoin is going to 1000!"  Yet he can continue to say this indefinitely because he didn't qualify this with a time statement, WHEN will it go to that point?  People speculate all the time as far as predicting when bitcoin will go up to x dollars, but no one states when it will pop.  Give us factual reasons and basis for the crypto bubble, and explain when it will pop.

Neither info wars nor McAfee should be considered a reliable source of information.

This is stupid.  Everyone saying its a bubble will never be wrong because eventually bitcoin will come down, whether it be 1 dollar down or 15k down.  Everyone that said bitcoin is a bubble needs to give us solid information regarding WHY its a bubble.  So far all i see is "so and so is an expert in money stuff, and they say its a bubble!"

Translation:  Banks try to become the middlemen again, this time in crypto.  All this bullshit "we're protecting investors" is just them trying to keep the money they have.

The company's name is literally GOLD man.  I don't think they'll be able to accurately predict wtf is going on.
