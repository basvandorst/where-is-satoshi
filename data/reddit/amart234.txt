Been dealing with the same situation with ltc for over 35 hours, here sitting tight, idk what to do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:16:04
I use coinbase and bittrex
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:00:55
bitcoins going to go down do some basic TA
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:21
what I've been saying.

Do you know how many days it takes for a ltc to come back to wallet after not being confirmed by the mempool??? I've been dealing with an unconfirmed tx for over 35 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:55
Do you really think BTC is not going to manipulated to suit the interests of the people shorting BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:13
I tried to manually set my hash but when I sent my tx It changed it to .0001 and my other that's been stuck for over 35hrs was sent with .005 or .0005. ltc network is clogged af I believe and fees are high like everything else

there's bound to be a correction. I think when the futures comes out, they're gonna get shorted hard. When else have you heard Jamie dimon saying anything good about bitcoin or mark cuban. I would wait or look into some alt coins that are taking a dip.

My transaction hasnt even been confirmed let alone pending. So if it;s not exactly clogged, why hasn't my coins been sent. I'm sending from my ledger nano to bittrex. Do you know if either one is experiencing problems with deposits?? I've been dealing with this for a while now.

unless you can get access into your account by providing info to your service provider your shit outta luck. learn from it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:50:43
how much did you send?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:20
Dammit, so is there anything I can do except wait it out? 
I'm sending from my ledger nano to bittrex. Ii'm pretty sure the ledger has been having some problems
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:59
i live in NY and use it just fine. if your not registered yet everything will take longer than usual because of so many people trying to buy and use the service.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:10:14
sorry to say. Never buy anything at an ATH. Ever hear of buy low sell high, you just broke that rule. Lesson learned. If you have to ask if your too late, you are. At least in the short term.

Bitcoin is still a baby, while there isn't main stream use of BTC, there is a growing market of retailers who do accept it. BTC is meant to be used as a currency, but right now it's looked at as store of value to most people because it's so new to 99% of the world. In the future yes, it should stabilize once all the coins are mined and there is a limited supply of coins.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:26:41
Leave it. Understand this is just temporary. BCH will not be replacing BTC anytime soon. What goes up will go down and vice versa. Relax, take a breather.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:21:21
It has value because the people who use the currency says it does. Why is USD worth anything, it's nothing more than a piece of cloth. It is not backed by anything store of value like gold. It has not been backed for a while. In the production of any crypto coin, there is the value it takes to mine that coin. It takes electricity to mine coins, so there is a basis of value in that. There were times when it cost more to mine what a bitcoin was worth on the market. I'm not an expert and someone can please correct me if anythings wrong, for my better understanding, but that's how I see it.
