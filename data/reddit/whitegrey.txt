I agree on that... And I think this would also work as a service or business-case where ppl would actually pay fees for added security or insurance and stuff. Even if this is something we've said we want to get rid of on the normal (Fiat, non-digital) banking sector.

I just started with Bitcoin in general and with small-scale mining only 1 month ago so I have only 0.02 BTC in my wallet at the moment... But I really dig what you guys are doing over there with SeansOutpost &amp; Satoshi's Forest so I've just sent 0.012 BTC on they way!
I know this is not much but if everybody who reads the message here would do the same it should be no problem to enable you a quicker and easier recovery...

You can listen to a preview of their new album here: 
Matter of introduction: The flood victims in Serbia. 101A played a concert there one year ago and really loved it there and as Japan shared kind of a similar history with the Earthquake/Fukushima-events she wanted to support the people there after learning about the flood incident - she's playing benefit concerts now and asked on Facebook how to best support them online when from Japan (where my Bitcoin-move came to play)...

For me it's more like to gain some experience in messing around with hardware and technology in general - and for supporting the network (in addition to running a Node [not a full 24/7 Node but better then nothing]). Like 10 years ago I had sort of a similar 'phase' with overclocking, water-cooling, PC-modding and stuff... I also started with distributed computing years before the whole crypto currency thing (I've been crunching numbers with RC5-56 and RC5-72 on distributed.net for quite a while)... So I'm doing it small-scale and as a hobby, mainly with a few USB-Miners, about 25 Gh right now, makes me just a few Dollars every few weeks - which I donate to NGOs and pledge-worthy projects. So my answer would be; For fun and for good cause - and not for profit... :)

I don't know how this is handled in other countries but over here (Austria) I can only do SEPA-transactions to other (EU)countries directly from my bank account - which means it needs to have sufficient funds on it - I can't go to the bank counter desk and transfer cash money to a SEPA account outside of my own country e.g. -&gt; even if I have the money in cash on hands. With Bitcoin nobody asks me weather my account is funded or not or weather I'm "allowed" to transfer from this country to this country...

**ENGLISH TRANSLATION PART 04:**
The maximum producible (?) quantity of Bitcoin is limited and capped to 21 million and the mathematical creation process is getting more and more difficult over the years. Conventional money on the other hand side is almost arbitrary inflationary - it generates a constantly growing debt mountain which is forcing us to permanent economical expansion and soaring exploitation of human mankind and of our planet.
Too little Bitcoin?
The cap to the maximum quantity of Bitcoin is raising the question how a world economy, -hypothetically- accepting bitcoin as a stateless currency, can handle the „low“ amount of 21 Million Bitcoin. Something is often overseen here:  Bitcoin-users calculate in Microbitcoin most of the time (μBTC, one millionth of a BTC, most recently often referred to as „Bit“). Occasionally the calculation will be done in the smallest possible unit of a Bitcoin, named Satoshi (the hundred millionth part of a Bitcoin). the theoretical maximal amount of Satoshi is 2.1 times 10 to the power of 15 or 2.1 quadrillions Satoshi. Which brings us to the next interesting aspect: The possible future value of (a) Bitcoin(s).
&lt; image: BTC value-chart, BTC vs. Dollar graph from 2009 to 20014 &gt;
The possible value of (a) Bitcoin(s)
The global value of all existing money worldwide is not easy to pin down. However, the so called M2-money supply (cash money, bank accounts, saving deposits) is stated to be about 60 quadrillions US-Dollar - that is a bit more then the extent of the gross world production.
During the next 10 years the cryptographic keys from about 18 Million Bitcoin will be finished calculating („mined“). Because people tend to save or stockpile (hoard) money, we assume that from the 18 Million BTC only 6 Million will be in circulation. Let’s assume Bitcoin have reached 10 percent of the worldwide (currency/money) share by then. That would give us a market capitalization of 600 billions to 6 trillions US Dollar - and in that case 1 Bitcoin would be worth 100.000 to 1 million Dollar. We would make our (daily?) purchases in μBTC and Satoshi. Merchants are interested in such a future because on purchases with Bircoin the 3 to 4 percent of credit card charge, they have to pay nowadays, will disappear.
The much broader fear, that hoarding of Bitcoin will automatically lead to deflation, is unfounded because Bitcoin will be generated for more then 100 years to go by „mining“, only just slower and slower - the Bitcoin is in a state of a controlled and -by algorithm- foreseen inflation process which is slowing down (finally?). Secondly: The higher the rate of Bitcoin rises, the more Merchants and eBay-User will try to get a few of our Satoshi.

Pretty much UK focussed... The only "problem" I often have with gift-cards is the fact that some shops or platforms make a difference in the country - best example is Apple where you need a gift-card from/for your country to buy products from there and most of the time those are not interchangeable for other country cards with the same value. Otherwise I'd total love the concept - but while Bitcoin is "global" many online-shops are not and have different branches and rules in different countries, even when it comes to payment and gift-cards...

**ENGLISH TRANSLATION PART 05:**
Of corse the idea of Bitcoin as a stateless reserve currency could end in a grand failure. Most likely this will happen if something better is appearing after some time. Because the source code was open to public from the beginning on there are alternatives to Bitcoin - many of these so called „Altcoins“ are already touting over the affection of potential users. Some of them can glade with innovative features, others with dogs or cats. Even if Bitcoin will fail as currency, the applied Peer-too-Peer cryptographic problem-solving approach used in the Bitcoin protocol is bound to stay - this ghost is out of the bottle.
&lt; image: doge &gt;
Software developers do realize, when they have a useful protocol in front of them. Just like on the early web in the 90s YouTube and Facebook could barely be predicted, there are new applications emerging right now which are using Bitcoin-technology in unexpected ways. For example, the pseudnymous tracking-capability of the information units on the Bitcoin-Network can also be used to proof the origin or existence of linked documents. Also the whole chapter of Micropayment will be completely rewritten the next few years - payment systems for apps and in-app-purchases should orient themselves on open-source-principles and not on corporations like Google, Apple and Microsoft. Bitcoin as a protocol, meant as a basis for applications, is just standing in its development process just there, where the world wide web has been in the early 90s.
Cryptographic Peer-to-Peer-money is the Bottom-Up-Alternative to the  Towp-Down-money model of the present (age). In front of this paradigm shift bank owners are in fear, because their primary business model - the creation of money out of thin air - is under threat. Even a gist secondary business of a bank, the accounting of high fees for bank accounts and (slow) transactions, is endangered by CryptoCurrency. Part of population who are not working in the bank(financial)-sector should have a deep interest in establishing Bitcoin or one of its Open-Source issue - at least as a worldwide reserve currency.

Phew... You can now find a basic translation to English in 5 parts below! :)
For correct order just set the sort-order to new instead of popular!
I'm neither a translator nor a good English speaker (first language is German) - so it took me about 3 hours - but I think it turned out good enough to get the idea, just don't mind various grammar and vocabulary errors. Maybe I'll put that into a better format and fix some things at some point later on (non-split and cleaned up PDF). If you want to send me a few Satoshi for the time I spent on the (even if only basic) translation feel free to send me a message.

I feel that would be a good idea... I mean sponsoring hackathons, programmers, entrepreneurs and so on. Getting Bitcoin more secure and future-proof helps the marketing for sure (security is still seen as a problem on a broader basis of ppl not too familiar with computers and/or crypto currency in general). I just don't see why it shouldn't be possible to do all of that? I don't care about fighting sports but maybe others do and if they feel they need to support it - why not... Isn't that what Bitcoin is all about -&gt; freedom of choice I mean?

If I like the design I'd def. make a donation just to get this (and limited means always 'special' - so that might even be a plus)...
Ok, you mentioned all of that already...

**ENGLISH TRANSLATION PART 02:**
The currently common money has not managed to keep up with the pace and speed of the Internet: Transferals may take days and can high costs can occur through fees. Different bank branches and corporations are often poorly connected (in terms of networking) and companies like Western Union or PayPal are not very consumer friendly. It’s time for new solutions. Mankind has re-invented money a few times throughout history - from seashells and coins to paper and data on knots and plastic cards. Cryptographic Peer-to-Peer-Currencies such as Bitcoin are the youngest development/evolution in the history of money. It has been researched for years beginning with 2009 (or: from 2009 on).
Basic principle is some kind of E-Cash, which can be transferred from user to user just like an E-Mail - direct, fast and without a bank. Both users don’t need to know each other.
Let’s pretend for example, I have Bitcoin worth 100 Euro on my PC. Now I’m transferring this information onto your PC and the value/amount is yours, whilst it has disappeared from my PC (at the same time/in the meantime). This transfer happened in a time-frame (or even fraction) of a few seconds, without fees (free) and without a bank, PayPal or Western Union. The prospective importance (in future) of this new technology maybe gets clearer, if you ask yourself the following question: What is more important in our life, E-Mail or money?
The fact that one can send value with Bitcoin in a similar fashion as sending an E-Mail and doing so happens even in a network of equal users (Peers) is remarkable, as it is the nature of the internet, that data can be easily copied. Now - how do you prevent digital money from being duplicated and sent out multiplied in fraudulent manner?
Scientists have worked for 20 years on a solution to this problem which is often called the „Problem of the Byzantine generals“ (?) in computer science. In this scenario 2 generals lay siege to a town and need to find an agreement, when to engage (attack) together. They send carriers with messenges to each other. But the carriers can make mistakes and it cannot be ruled out, that/if there are traitors serving under the generals, who carry and hand over wrong information (the traitors, not the generals). Put into context of the Internet the problem stands as follows: How can I, at a Peer-to-Peer-network, informations that represent value, pass on (transfer) to a another person in a reliable manner?
@_date: 2014-04-25 09:01:01
China's Internet-landscape is highly regulated with the "great firewall" and all sorts of other stuff interfering with any stuff the gov denies or thinks of as bad... so if we talk about unregulated use of BTC in China I guess we need to keep in mind that many other things have to be fixed over there first.
I highly recommend reading this article;  and checking out  from time to time.

@_date: 2014-05-05 03:26:44
**ENGLISH TRANSLATION PART 03:**
The most important part: Bitcoin as a protocol
The reliable transfer is guaranteed thanks to a new communication-protocol, actually the core technology behind Bitcoin. The Internet, as we know it today, is based upon various protocols, for example HTTP for the world wide web, POP/SMTP for E-Mail, TCP/IP for the connection of our routers and PC’s. The importance of Bitcoin as a new protocol cannot be overvalued - but more on that later.
&lt; image: „Four types of alternative currencies“ &gt;
The fact, that Bitcoin is often viewed or referred to skeptical and in a way of sensation mongering at public discussion, is maybe owed to the use of descriptive but at the same time deceptive/abstract terms while describing technical complicated procedures: the term „Mining“ for example. It awakens the wrong associations of greedy gold diggers, exploited mineworkers and quick wealth.
A Bitcoin-user who allows the mining-software to „dig up“ is basically handling two tasks: The cryptographic validation of transactions from other Bitcoin-users and to generate new cryptographic keys. Bitcoin is allowing the reliable transfer of value between equal Peers only because the encryption is on an extremely high level. At the moment the network of bitcoin users holds more processing power then the 500 fastest supercomputers all together (worldwide).
For the processing time a single user a.k.a. „miner“ is allocating to the network, he’s getting a reward - fractions of the cryptographic money that has just bee generated. So it would make more sense to call this process maintaining (or caring for) the network instead of „mining“.
I often hear - with „mining“ Bitcoin the same happens - money is made out of thin air again and the next financial bubble is approaching. But the exact opposite is the case!
Especially cryptographic money like Bitcoin cannot be created out of nowhere through issuing a credit, but only through the complex calculation of mathematical checksums. The existence of this Bitcoin can be clearly proven an it cannot be duplicated in a magic way or increased somehow else. This is a serious counter model to our currently used money, which is also sitting in computers for a big part but which can be scooped just by tipping in a number at the process of granting a credit.

Actually I sort of use a MasterCard service to buy Bitcoin over here (in Austria) without actually using a full fledged non-anonymous credit card! All of that via cash4web prepaid vouchers which can be bought anonymously at kiosks (tobacconists) in my country -&gt; 25 Euro, 50 Euro, 100 Euro and 150 Euro are available - this service was actually invented to make online-transactions via credit card service much easier and more anonymous! Head over to  for info. Then I just type in the voucher number on the cash4web to BTC service I use (not started officially yet so no Link here, sorry) and get Bitcoin to my wallet nearly instantly (there can be some waiting time for the card to be activated first - e.g. 10 to 20 minutes - but when that's through the transactions finish in seconds). Works totally fine for me - can't wait to see this in full action later on (I'll post it here as soon as the service has it's official start)... :)
Other then that: Just don't use their cards - and if you still have one just quit the service...

I (for my personal part) would spend more time and money over there if they enable Bitcoin-payments!
At an earlier stage I was backing a few projects a month on both indiegogo and kickstarter - with a volume ranging from 50 to 250 Dollar - and it felt good to me (really depended on the projects tho). But after a while I ran into issues with PayPal (pending trust-levels and so on, too high transfer-volumes) and it became a real hassle because I didn't want to use my credit card either and PayPal was not accepted with all projects - so I kind of dumped it after using these sites for the span of about a year and total pledges of about 700-800 Dollar (I used indiegogo more then kickstarter in the end - I liked their fund-payout-even-if-goal-not-reached attempt)...
Nowadays I see a few projects which are running campaigns over there (indiegogo) but Bitcoin is not part of it so it's impossible to get the the associated perks the Bitcoin-way, even if they accept Bitcoin-pledges on their real/external websites - but just not on indiegogo or kickstarter...

If you have one I'd also make sure to advertise it to some people!

Just donated 5 Euro worth of Bitcoin! Thanks for the Link, please try to push this - the people there really have a bad time right now!
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:48:24
Sounds good to me... How can I help with this? Any newsletter or page where I can find instructions, any mail-addresses where I can ask? Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:34:17
placing my first order in a few days, can't wait to see how it works out (located in Austria)... :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:18:22
They do answer in person it seems! I've got a nice reply where they are asking why I want Bitcoin to be added and supported as a pledge/donation-option... I think I've sent out a proper answer - with a list of the benefits I see in using Bitcoin (in addition to stuff like PayPal - which they'll also add later on it seems).
Anyways this a good project if you ask me, would be great if people can support them :)
@_date: 2014-05-11 04:35:24
Tell me how to do it and I'll try... The link is public tho - feel free to use it or repost it as you like (i was just the first to post it here, otherwise not involved by any means)...
@_date: 2014-05-11 11:11:19
That was very nice and heartwarming actually!
And thanks for providing the BTC address here directly - I'll donate a few bits later on for sure :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:35:39
Are they shipping to mainland (central) EU? If so I might buy some stuff in near future...
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:32:22
"On The Longest Chain Rule and Programmed Self-Destruction of Crypto Currencies" - a paper that's been up on cryptome.org since a few days (Cryptome is a smaller-scale whistleblower-related platform, they also link to WikiLeaks-related stuff).
Btw: I have nothing to do with it, just stumbled upon it - I don't share the opinions stated in there but as mentioned it was an interesting read...
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:16:39
I'm also thinking about running a full node lately... The only Problem is; I have a dynamic IP-address while it's suggested to have a static IP-address... So maybe I'll go the v-server or VPN route instead (downside: location would not be in my country - that just a statistic-thing tho).
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:33:04
he probably mixed it up with the blockchain.info wallet-app...?
@_date: 2014-05-30 02:35:34
I still get the "how do you even get a decent amount of Bitcoin without mining" a lot...
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:32:00
I'll share that - it's a pretty good and easily-understandable one! :)
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:03:57
btw: there will be a Bitcoin ATM on site (no Lamassu tho - some open source ATM from czech afaik)! Even if it's only during that event it's really good news as we don't have any of these in our country so far - I'll make sure to check that one out!
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:30:33
Working on a translation to English atm, it will take some time tho. You can expect it tomorrow I guess (if somebody is faster then me -&gt; feel free to step in first).
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:03:17
Ok, didn't have this information ;) Well, if Linux is your main system then it's not even worth a try I guess... iTunes is perfect on Mac OSX and not so good anymore but still working on Windows... Only with Linux; no Chance... But well, it was worth a try (I'm on a Mac) :p

**ENGLISH TRANSLATION PART 01:**
Why we need Bitcoin
Or: How money is made and an alternative way to it
Since a few years I’m wondering about the fact that many people don’t know how new money is scooped. Just try it out and ask your friends: „How is new money coming into existence?“. Besides getting lots of shrugs you’ll possibly get answers like „the federal bank is printing it (note: in Austria the federal bank is called National Bank - so I’ll stick with National Bank here, keep that in mind!)“. Or „The government is making it“ and „it will be generated (by economy)“.
The right answer is:
New money comes to life when a bank issues a credit.
This can be a National Bank, a bigger local branch bank, a post office bank at a small village. New money is brought into the cycle when a bank employee types the amount into his computer. The bank doesn’t need to take the amount out of the safe from a saving deposit of another client - instead it creates money just out of nothing.
&lt; image: Euro-notes &gt;
In Europe banks need to put only 1 percent of the principal of loan aside at the National Bank as a so called minimum reserve - for a credit of 10.000 Euro only 100 Euro. And even this amount can be fetched back by the bank via credits from just another bank. The fractional reserve banking system is the norm not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Even tho central banks as the European Central Bank (ECB/EZB) are able to control the amount of credit-generated amount of money - mainly just via modifying the percentage of the minimal reserve (pre 2011 that one was 2 percent instead of 1 percent) and via increasing the interest rates which they are charging the banks for issuing credits: Then the banks are more likely to refrain from taking credits and also from issuing credits to their clients or they are more likely to issue less credits to their clients themselves.
Maybe it’s not bothersome to the owners of banks, that most people don’t even know money is created through bank lending. Making money out of nothing is the most profitable business model in existence after all. Unfortunately this leads to the case that more and more debts and interests have to be serviced (or paid), the economy has to grow bigger and bigger and the gap between loaners (rich) and borrowers (poor) is getting bigger. The less people see that loaned money is made out of thin air, the better for the banks.

I'm a big noob it seems! :&lt; How do I collect this (step-by-step)? Thanks for the help! :)
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:20:28
you can also use your bank account to transfer money to PayPal, or you can buy various prepaid bons for online-purchases (gift cards and so on) with cash... So it is definitely is not the _only_ way... But it is a cheap and good way if you have the knowledge and access to the tools needed (a PC or Smartphone with internet access is still not standard in many parts of the world) ;)
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:59:07
I care about how I can integrate it in my daily life and not about anything being posted on the internet ;)

@_date: 2015-05-09 14:31:55
as for small amounts it's not that important to really shut all doors. Cold storage is more likely to keep 'savings' and a wallet is more like a purse with amounts to spend... Better (web)wallets have 2-factor authentication or other security features such as sms-notices to your phone and so on.

0.005 BTC sent to the Food Drive! :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:38:26
Sent them an E-Mail and left a Facebook-shout! Seems like I haven't been the first one suggesting the use of BTC over there (at least on facebook)... :)
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:22:32
Solved: Found and bought it on  - worked like a charm and was a very nice all-Bitcoin-experience! :)
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:03:39
I think proper regulation would help BTC with gaining wider acceptance with the 'average Joe' as there are still many people who believe everything that's unregulated might be shut down by governments or authorities due to concerns over (in this case) fraud, money-laundering, tax-evasion and so on... I myself wouldn't mind if it's kept unregulated or 'untouched' but to be realistic - the bigger it gets ant the more focus or attention it draws the more people will ask this exact question. So I think it would be good to start this discussion today and not tomorrow, just to have benefits of knowledge when e.g. officials ask the same questions. Here in 'my' country (Austria) everything seems to be fine so far :) I'm unbanked, so I'm 'off the grid' somehow already :p
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:55:10
Thanks for the suggestions, such input helps to question my own views as both of you have good points basically :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 23:06:36
If the free worldwide shipping really works you can count me in... Only for 'small' stuff at the moment, but I guess _every_ BTC-sale will boost the stats of that payment method :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 11:11:45
That's all good and so (and I also tried it once)... But maybe a much more efficient way in the long run would be to get actual crowdfunding-platforms to finally accept Bitcoin (via Discovery maybe). This way not only single bands would profit. That's my opinion at least. As for e.g. tipping DJ's and such I think I'm still with you.
@_date: 2015-04-11 19:51:59
In my country it gets more and more expensive to transfer cash money to another bank account or to pay bills of e.g. your network-provider in at their service-shops in person and so on. Basically you are forced to have a bank account by an unwritten law - which tells you; if you don't have a bank account you are not a trustworthy person...
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:11:12
I can back it with personal experience in going unbanked for a while (no bank account at all for a few months) - and that's usually when people turn their heads asking; is this even possible? And from that point on I usually have a good basis to move on :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:22:04
I already added this earlier today... ;)
But nobody seems to have noticed so far D:
They are accepting BTC for quite a while now btw. - so basically the News here is that they are back from hiatus and asking for donations in general.
@_date: 2015-09-15 04:16:00
I also do... Even tho I must admit I use it mainly as a fast option to fund my PayPal account (way faster then transferring money to PayPal via wire transfer). But also in general; I use it more often now - I go to the Bitcoin ATM more often to re-stock my funds, I upgrade my cloud-mining services more often (paying with Bitcoin). My adoption has definitely grown over the last couple of months... Also using services like Bitwa.la now - works like a charm.
@_date: 2015-09-05 07:55:12
Thanks for the info! Donated 1 Euro :)
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:57:44
I don't know the exact split, but part of it will be used for BTC-tips/presents to the attendees (that's the best way to spread knowledge, in my opinion) - so that amount can stay in BTC for sure. And I guess most of the guest speakers from outside will also accept part of their expenses (traveling,...) in BTC as they are BTC-enthusiasts after all... We are aware that every step in the chain involves fees (transfer/exchange,...) - but after all BTC was the fastest and easiest way to go with.

Highly concerned here... During the last - I'd say - 1.5 years this stuff is getting more and more visible to me (location: EU); e.g. I see nearly all of the banks closing most of their personell-driven direct-to-customer stuff and put terminals for registered bank accounts there, going the 'online'-route (chat/video-support, online banking with computerized assistants), and so on.
And at the same time restrictions of e.g. exchanging or sending money without being a registered consumer has gotten much more expensive or even made impossible over here. And they don't even tell it to you if you don't ask... Recently I wanted to do a wire transfer (domestic) via cash, unregistered at a normal sized / popular bank here - which was no problem like a few months back (it did cost a fee, but well - it was possible at least) - and the cashier told me; sorry - you can't, we don't do it anymore since quite some time. When I told him last time was no problem at another town at the same company he told me they stopped doing it 2 months ago. I never read or heard about them doing so in public, so I think it was more likely a 'silent' move to not make a big fuss about it. I had to go to another bank where it still is possible (they told me they are one of the few left in that area accepting unregistered wire-transfers [unregistered not in the sense of anonymous but in the sense of not having a bank account or being a regular/registered customer there], but they charge like 5€ to do so - which is A LOT for just not giving them all of your data)...

I'm unbanked by decision since about a year now - and still alive and happy! It's not easy sometimes - but for me; totally worth it... :)
