If I am trying to keep what I am doing with this bitcoin confidential, does posting the transaction ID risk the security of the transaction? As in, will people be able to tell who I am sending the BTC to and would it reveal any info about myself? Sorry I dont really know how to word this and this is probably a ridiculous question, I just am not the most knowledgable about bitcoin.

So it is the change address...but how do I get the bitcoin sent and the change back into my wallet??

Nvm I got it haha sorry thanks 
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:35:44
So do you know how to get the BTC unstuck? Did I do something wrong when sending the bitcoin that made the change address show up?
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:36:38
I am not sure. How do I check? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:52:08
