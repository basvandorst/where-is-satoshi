I was astonished how slowly my recent Bitcoin transaction took. I think that's a real problem. I guess Lightning Network will help somehow. That being said, even though I knew AOL sucked back in the 90's and didn't invest in it, it had mindshare, and the stock made a lot of people a lot of money. Of course, it turned out AOL did suck and they basically don't exist anymore. However, the premise of online communities, sharing etc lives on, just like crypto will live on. Will it be bitcoin, I don't know, I kind of doubt it. But only time will tell. For now, you can make a buck like those early AOL shareholders. Just don't get greedy and take some profits along the way.

well, I thought was better than on a website... at least its on-device encrypted with access controls. Weak spots I guess are Apple screwing something up or a rogue Coinbase Wallet developer. Thanks for the feedback. Helpful.

What prevents the Fed from just buying up Bitcoin and hodling it themselves (assuming they're not already). They have virtually unlimited fiat to do so. Then they just hold it in a vault like they do with gold?

The total market cap of bitcoin is a fart in the wind compared to the multi trillion dollar federal budget. I think they could come up with the funds to hodl if they wanted. As a bitcoin owner and savvy investor betting on NEVER is when you really make money. Anyway, not arguing. Cheers.

Ok. Trying to understand how that would help. If there are 10 pieces of gold in the world and one person owns 9 of them. It doesn't make the remaining 1 piece of gold more valuable because it can be split up? Asking for real not for drama.

Have some crypto because FOMO. Most people can barely reset a password. This process doesn't bode well for regular  people and thus crypto, IMO.

Fair enough :-) would love to hear others thoughts.

It's an opinion based on real world experience... there is no "reset password" on a crypto wallet... yet it does actually exist in the real world... you've probably used it yourself. Just sayin' there has to be a better system. Not looking to argue, but I am comfortable being able to look at both pros and cons.

Well, they took most of the gold, in fact criminalized it ([ and took us off the gold standard. I don't see why the same thing couldn't happen with bitcoin.
