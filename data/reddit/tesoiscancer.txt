Even pennies of gains = worrying about capital gains
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:57:01
I think people have no clue wtf this means.
I want to see an ESRB of cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:32:22
I want to spend my BTC using shift debit card.
This means daily capital gains tax...
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:04:19
I think its volitle because its extremely undervalued. 
Give it a few years to grow and get boring. Its been boring for months which make it fine right now.
It only becomes difficult during the bull runs, which IMO is a good problem for existing users.

ETFs use United States finance law.
Bitcoin uses crypto for validation, no impact from any government.
These are very different things, one can be regulated, the other cannot.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:32:08
Transaction fees and speeds seem to be fixed with LN.
How about power consumption? Any development to reduce this?
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:53:02


Hardforking is basically a scam. The rest of the world went forward  with the original blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:40:25
If I use Shift card(Bitcoin Debit card), am I going to pay capital gains tax on every purchase?
Did anyone use this last year? How did you do taxes?
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:29:07
Tech moves fast. Politics doesnt.
Wondering how we can get rid of the BS capital gains tax on every transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:53:11
Stretching really hard huh?
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:39:53
Ugh, capital gains taxes kills my most hopeful purpose of BTC, daily transactions.
Guess we will forever have CryptoGold rather than Cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:28:23
Trying to think of other companies that did this during the 90s and 2000s tech revolution.
Dial up is my only idea.
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:51:35
The amazing part is that all these layer 2 solutions are good.
All of them make the environment competitive and force everyone to work hard.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:21:42
Okay, so my issue is that I got a shift card, which is a BTC debit card.
Every transaction realizes in USD, so I need to pay capital gains on every transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:24:04
Also no capital gains tax on USD transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:41:05
Adaptation is more important than anything. Its why Bitcoin is known worldwide and not Peercoin.
It sounds like your criticism of Bitcoin is that it has multiple uses rather than a singular purpose for existence. 




It seems everyone on facebook wants to use Bitcoin as an investment. Libertarians want to use it as a currency. And there are global transactions that benefit from it.
Robinhood isnt preventing or hindering the later. It will only drive up value and increase the worlds effort to implement bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:47:54


What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:31:21
Do we have a solution to power requirements?
My environmentalist friends are shilling alt coins for this reason.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:45:41
Im okay  with Bitcoin being digital gold, but the rest of the cryptocurrencies were claimed to have solved transaction issues.
They need to solve political issues too.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:37:22
Speak for yourself, Trump just cut taxes with no plans of cutting spending.
Inflation is inevitable.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:43:56
Robinhood is charging significantly less fees than coinbase, maybe this is the reason why?
They buy bulk bitcoin and pay the 2$ blockchain fee. Then they let users buy and sell in their internal exchange.
If you dont like that model, there are plenty of other exchanges that can help you get BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:40:23
People talking about Lightning network like its the only layer 2 solution. 
Weve been using exchanges for literally years.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:51:36
On the bright side, now you dont have a car that breaks 3 times a year.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:56:22
I meant this more like Bitcoin on hand.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:37:58
As long as you arent buying bullruns, bitcoin is pretty stable.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:45:38
Its not like people are buying stuff at the local mall in Bitcoin yet.
If 1m more people get into bitcoin because of robinhood, thats 1m more people for your local mall to appeal to.
Give it time, we need in-store purchases, we need wordpress plugins, we need more layer 2 solutions, we need more exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:21:21
As long as they horde the coins, it takes bitcoin out of  the supply and pays the original owner.
Whats the difference?
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:38:35
The supply of gold is pretty similar yearly, the concern is that we develop low cost nuclear reactions that can product vast amounts of gold. (we did chemistry with diamonds despite being unable to for 10s of thousands of years)
My bigger point was that bitcoin is pretty easy to transport while gold is heavy. This makes it appealing where gold is not.
You can pay fees to have it move across the world instantly. You can pay lower fees to send it in a few weeks(which is similar to gold). You can use layer 2 solutions(exchanges) to move it using a middleman. 
Its superior to gold in some aspects, and depending on how difficult transferring bitcoin is in the future, we could see it used as a daily currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:46:48
I think 1.8x better to be exact????
Then batching, then more layer 2 solutions.
Oh alt-coiners, you never listened to your local Cryptonerd....
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:36:40
In 2011, this was the libertarians dream.
Its weird to see how bitcoin has grown and how the government is okay with it.
Its a different world today.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:56:40
This took me back to my masters degree, and hearing you explain it like this makes soo much sense.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:32:06
The vast majority of the population wants money to exchange, most arent doing it to launder money.
Thats how bad socialism has left this country.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:47:41
This is literally what layer 2 is.
Coinbase does this.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:35:36
The bigger celebration is that cryptonoobies are learning bitcoin is king.
For a minute there people were beliving in ICOs.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:34:08


@_date: 2018-02-22 17:40:49


You think?
I imagine that most people are buying on an exchange and never touching it.
This means only the exchanges are doing blockchain transactions.
Layer 2 is already here
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:52:13
On top of this, Bitcoin can increase block size to ease the pain if they truely must.
Bitcoin is going to solve the problems, developers arent going to stop.
Altcoiners have no idea how relentless programmers are. alt coins need to solve problems that Bitcoin cannot.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:58:22
Er Fraud is probably the better word.
Calling your copy pasted code Bitcoin was the fraud
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:45:06
To clarify, if this is to happen again, someone would need to buy 1000 BTC(approx 10M)
Thats good for the market even if they are spamming.
If Bitcoin hits 100,000$/USD, the cost of spamming goes to 100M.
That kind of money would shake the bitcoin market in a fantastic way. Probably driving the cost to higher amounts than 100M.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:15:11
Doesnt matter.
Its fraud to trick people into buying Bitcoin but providing them with a fake product.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:46:14
btw, why is BCH fee higher than BTC? Why in the BCH blockchain are transactions more expensive?
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:39:17
Can we tease bank of america to make them look silly?
I dont want the government to get scared and do something stupid.
If I learned anything from trump, I think we should have a twitter campaign making fun of Bank of America. 
We need more time and investment.
