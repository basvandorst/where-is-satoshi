We will also come and install a new hard drive for you for free! Ho Ho Ho.

I don't run a node or mine but... I like big 
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:25:38
You had me at bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:18:08
How can they do this! These blocks are way too small! They're supposed to wait until we have achieved bulbous blocks and captured Bitcoin before the green lightning. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:54:53
It's great work if you can get it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 03:04:49
These metaphors are 1mb blocks. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:36:48
There is nothing efficient about coffees. In fact, I can't think of a better way to enjoy a cup of Joe than to get deluxe blocks with my Venti. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:41:25
What are trying to do with that thumbnail? Raise the level of discourse?! 
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:06:00
Please put me down for 10 coinbase controls everything votes. You're admin right? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:50:23
You tell 'em Eric. It's time to have a block party! We can roll some dice, shift some crypto, and bloat all the chains 2gether!
@_date: 2016-01-20 03:56:57
Mike is a beautiful man. He likes big blocks and long walks. The eloquence with which he talks. I want to... Oops quitting time. See y'all bright and early. We've got a big day ahead of us. Lots of comments to make... And the accounts! Peace... Not!

In BitttBurgers fantasy world: Core programmers, dressed in white, speak with thundering tone from on high as the rest of us slave away at dreary work. Programmers have subjugated and begun to oppress the innocent managers and industry experts of the world.
The banks are now the weak just hoping to be thrown a merged-PR or two. In the decaying halls, echoes of "TPS reports" and "what about coffees?" can be heard bouncing through the ventilation. But for BitttBurger, there's hope. He's found a chink in the armor. Some magic words that he thinks might pierce the mathematics.
"Behold!", he cries. "Programmers need managers!!!"
and pit pat piffy, the universe stops, collapses, and regenerates as it was in 1980, ready to replay the good old days when men were men, computers were playthings, and men in suits held meaningful power.

I love 75% and 51% would be sweet but I'll settle for 90%. Wait who said 90%? Pure genius. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:04:09
Guess we're really behind this initiative!
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:33:40
Why ruin a good thing? Oh yeah. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 01:44:36
Yeah forget NYDFS. Now we have consider.it to guide us.
@_date: 2016-01-24 06:52:38
The problem with this is bloom filter saturation over the linear decay function makes it very simple to fingerprint each node and leads to centralization. Personally, I'm OK with that. A lot more people use PayPal so we've got to compete somehow.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:57:24
I coulda taken over the chain too, if it weren't for you darn devs. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:49:54
Long-lived forks are my favorite. Instead of 1mb OR 2mb, I get 3!
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:42:34
C'mon Core. Do 2mb. It's the leastest bad option. What are you, chickun? 
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:42:36
Now we know you're lying. Nobody searches the sub. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:20:11
I signed on because sending money to ip addresses is just cool. Satoshi's vision has become blurred beyond all recognization.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:33:45
Who cares about bugs. I want moaaaar space!
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:17:41
5 weeks seems slow. Let's do this. I consider myself pretty good with the code. Imma fork a check out and apply a hotpatch. It won't be pretty but it'll work.
I'm calling it Bitcoin Herring because that's my favorite fish. Since marketing is important I've thought of that too. 
Bitcoin Herring: Bitcoin scalability is too important to wait for Classic and Core. Sink your teeth into Bitcoin Herring. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 08:48:02
Addendum to this advice: Core is actually not not relevant. Unlike banks who are simply not relevant.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:58:14
Pay no mind. Consider.it is the future. It's how all decisions should be made ever. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:43:47
Exactly. We should be designing this for top of the line, state of the art technology. Only PayPal and Coinbase, evoorhees, people like that, need to run a full node. The rest of us can just trust them. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 03:19:38
I want reversible transactions for that we need centralization and for THAT we need us some big ass blocks. Who's with me? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 01:42:23
la la la la 2mb la la la la
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:56:41
Wait, don't go! We still have a chance to turn this thing around and get us some big ass blocks! 
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:00:22
Yes. Yes. Bend to the will of ~~myself~~ the community.
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:45:57
Spit on, chap! This fee business is so tiresome. I propose we initiate a new hard fork that does away with them entirely. Only question is what to call it? 
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:18:02
Fuck yeah. Gimme some xfibity up in this biotch!
@_date: 2016-03-08 07:33:03
NO. You can't have it. We were on our break!
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:30:29
Seriously, we expect the Fed to tighten as they work toward normalization.
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:00:10
Guys what I want to know is how to help his excellence help us? If he and the banks fall who will provide jerbs? 
@_date: 2016-01-20 03:31:29
Apology accepted. Bitstamp not evil. Bitstamp just doing as they're told. But not on THIS issue. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:52:56
Mike, you'll always be in my heart. Stay strong Sport. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:54:07
Just imagine those Block sizes with a 1, next to them. That'd be so fucking sweet. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 21:52:37
I prefer Medium. Tweets are way too small. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 03:03:34
We all need to hold hands and imagine some Big Ol' Blocks!
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:09:59
20? That's just the weekend shift. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 06:42:04
I use a keyboard and am petty by nature. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 05:07:20
That was beautiful. R3's looking for a new mouthpiece I hear. You should apply. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:59:03
To the moon. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:40:35
Long words are long. I have a credit card! Can't bitcoin just work like that? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:44:52
You have to admit they have a very organized propaganda arm and that it's funded by "The Treasury", a sort of ongoing premine to pump the scam. I think that lady's going to have a hard time showing her face on this planet once the shit blows up.
@_date: 2016-01-20 03:14:10
Seriously, I was just talking with my niece about this. She's pretty smart, got a four year degree and all of that so we all try to consult with her on important issues like the Bitcoin Block Size. Wait what is the block size now and what do we want it to be? Going to try and bounce some ideas off her and will come back with her response.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:53:45
When do we get some bigger blocks?! You know, the kind we can really hold on to? When I think about bigger blocks, I just can't think about anything else. Damn. Please Kore. I don't have much but I need this. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:39:17
You can learn to love small blocks. But fuck that, I like big blocks and I cannot lie! 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:14:03
It was me. Need some extra cash for this weekend's party where we'll be enjoying the musical stylings of SirMixAlot. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:42:35
Goddammit. What the fuck do we have to do to get some big ass blocks up in this bish?
@_date: 2016-02-16 00:16:27
What do we want? Moon! 
When do we want it? Now! 
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:17:53
I'll take Two Weeks (tm)!
@_date: 2016-02-12 01:32:48
Let it go! No don't! Am I doing this right? 
/Cheer up Gavin. You'll take us to the moon someday. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 23:06:50
Good to see he's sticking to his guns!
@_date: 2016-02-16 00:15:31
Why the /s? 
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:14:03
Low blow. We're on consider.it now. Duh! 
@_date: 2016-10-07 05:46:33
We're going to need verification.
@_date: 2016-10-03 02:05:25
Sup. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 02:36:45
Blockchain does, silly. What's with the third degree over here? 
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:18:57
We like it a little shiatty.
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:50:51
Cheerio. Can confirm. I am British, concerned about leaving the European Union and buying an absolute shit-ton of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-29 16:09:36
Spot on, old chap.
