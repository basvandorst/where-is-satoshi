did you just call reverb256 a but fuck?
but seriously, in your fantasy world where BTC is banned, CC would instantly become the majority of the economy overnight, guaranteed, that's why they haven't and never will.
but in your fantasy land, when they throw the switch, the personal damage liabilities alone would be a wonder to see, like watching some brutality snuff film vs a helpless cute fluffy something involving ***much pleasure and demented reveling***

a lot of times when i see a frothing comment like this i can replace a few words and it's perfectly accurate.
replace bitcoin with "central banking" for a sane version
also, about the drug shit:
this is why it would be hypocritical to blanket ban btc because "illegalness"
* "Ban BTC because illegalstufff"
* "Why Is BTC BAnned?"
* "Because it's illegal because it was used for illegal things"
* "what about fiat isn't it being used for illegal things?"
* "oh, right...."

siezing ebay for illegals slippin through is like banning water because terrorists drink it, and sadly the broken association game that is used against our liberties

if they do auction them they can't ban them afterwards, now that would appear brazenly free of principle and entirely oppressive
also, this proves the govt. is competent and capable enough to give this guy his well earned money back

the volatility in bitcoin is directly correlated to the volatility of fiat, it's all the gimmicks and magic that keep the thing from splitting at the seams and exposing the lie, then the *real* ponzie scheme would be revealed.

and people aren't as keen on internet censorship as they are on a total BTC ban, the former involves some technical knowledge to wrap your head around and would have a "softer impact" on the people who care about censorship but don't see blocking an "illegal website" as censorship or oppression, which is wrong, but things will be twisted to make the monster look like a sheep much easier through this route
