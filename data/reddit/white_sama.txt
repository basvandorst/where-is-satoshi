$1 is already way too much. Off-chain solutions only centralise bitcoin. Bitcoin is the blockchain, bitcoin needs to happen on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:04:55
Why would someone buy BCH at 8k though? That's not the price.
Again, that's because of consensus (and sementics). The whole argument of the BCH people is that it shouldn't be like that because BTC doesn't have legitimacy anymore.

My post was obviously sarcastic.

Just because it's compatible doesn't mean it's the same.
Bitcoin introduced crypto to the world. It promised a truly decentralized network with its blockchain technology. And now what does it do? Look for ways to get stuff off the blockchain. To me that isn't bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:43:53
Crypto is confusing. You are nitpicking to serve your own interests.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:13:47
Then maybe bitcoin as a whole is obsolete? Bitcoin needs on chain scaling to remain true to itself. If you think on chain scaling is impossible because it would take too much space... We're not getting anywhere. Crypto has had a lot of traction lately. Not "buy your coffee every day with crypto" traction, but all that financial investing has opened the floodgates for new transactions. Keep in mind that these transactions will disappear once the price stabilises.

Becauses it acknowledges that BCH exists and is used, and that's a problem around these parts.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:58:07
People are so addicted to seeing BTC's bubble go higher and higher that even the slightest disruption must be silenced until it can get to 10k or something. Who cares about tech, scaling or usability. I WANT IT TO BE WORTH MORE AND MORE AND MORE.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:56:14
Too bad I'm not the only one who thinks that way huh. Maybe we'll win out in the end, or maybe the blockchain in its purest form will die. Oh well.
This is just a hard fork. Some people chose to stay on the legacy chain and continue it with their own update. Which one of us is Bitcoin's ETC is up to opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:12:08
Because I'm here for bitcoin, and segwit isn't bitcoin. It's not the blockchain. It's not satoshi's vision.
I do not care what "institutinal investors" think. I care about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:26:57
I'm not saying you're wrong in any way. If we truly want to shoot for crypto (and bitcoin) to replace fiat, then we need a lot more scale. But to me, that scaling needs to happen on chain if we really want bitcoin to stay decentralized. So unless we find solutions to scale on chain in time before mainstream adoption, bitcoin can't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:22:07
So ETC isn't actually ethereum is what you're telling me?
Core has changed Bitcoin's rules and now you say "if you don't agree with the new rules, you're not Bitcoin". I say "if you don't agree with the original whitepaper rules, you're not Bitcoin".
Bitcoin isn't a brand. Bitcoin is an idea. Bitcoin is a revolution. Trying to tie bitcoin to a brand is just pure marketing speak, which works wonders if what you're doing is trying to pump the price up.

Why isn't making the blocks bigger a viable solution? Do you know how cheap storage has been getting recently, and how cheap it's going to get? And not everyone needs to download the full blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:07:24
Bitcoin has gone on for years with tiny 1MB blocks. If we ever get to 1GB blocks, flash storage will be so cheap by then and internet speeds will be so fast that it probably won't change much.
We probably will never need 1GB blocks, but I'm just saying it wouldn't change much.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:47:02
I don't think it's meant to confuse people (if you don't have the brain cells required to see that btC and bCh are two different things, leave crypto please...). It's more of a symbol of legitimacy.
Bitcoin is an idea. Bitcoin is the whitepaper. Bitcoin is its blockchain. If some other crypto uses its idea, its whitepaper and its blockchain better than the crypto called "Bitcoin", then this crypto is more "bitcoin" than BTC is.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:08:10
So Bitcoin is a brand that only the guys at core are allowed to use because they were the first ones on it?
Satoshi would probably be very sad to hear this.
Nice strawman btw, I never said all crypto is bitcoin, only those that use bitcoin's whitepaper and blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:54:06
This shouldn't let them influence over the whole currency for its lifetime. I'd say they've been more than rewarded at this point.
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:02:01
It's John McAfee we're talking about here. If anything, he probably needs to stretch his neck up.
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:55:24
Agreed. If the current miners don't like where bitcoin/crypto is going because they're not making fiat millions a day anymore, may they sell their hardware so that people with bitcoin's vision take over their business.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:46:42
True... Bitcoin might not be big enough for the "antminer monopoly" to be comparable to the "google monopoly" but still... Pretty damn steep slope to climb for any startup.

The activation of UASF may create two blockchains
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:08:30
The problem is that they've usurped the power. Chips are being sold at a stupidly slow rate, letting the "big miners" keep their share of the cake and thus their unfair influence over the market.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:53:47
But these companies aren't comparable. Because most of them don't produce hardware, only software, and all of them were the first at what they were doing. They're the ones who created the monopoly. Now it's too late. We're in a situation where we have to launch a new search engine and go against google while expecting to be competitive and profitable during the first year. Now does that seem possible to you?
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:18:27
Sure, but electronics engineers with a deep understanding of the bitcoin algorithm aren't just lying around you know. The dev costs are too high right now for new chip makers to just rise out of nowhere (and even if they did their chip probably wouldn't be as powerful and thus not many people would buy them).
Unless someone with big money that doesn't expect to make a profit and only wants to support the vision steps up, this situation is a lock.

Does anyone have info on Exodus? I've been using it for trading purposes but I don't know what their view on the forking is.
