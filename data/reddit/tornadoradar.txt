Man I'm hoping they open up again.  Ready to toss in for 10 of them.

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:02:42
you mean a slice right?  instead of dividend
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:03:16
I'll wait.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:21:33
Money changes people man. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:40

@_date: 2017-12-27 10:55:11

The east coast of the us isn’t up yet.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:04:00
I thought fdic was per account type per person.   So having two checking accounts is still just 250k of checking protection.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:00:04
mines about 14% right now.    he's been realllllyy good over the years 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:16:44
You can.  It’s just not wise.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:31
if its over priced then why are you buying? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:28:42
thats not how you hodl
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:39:33
Over 250k per account exceeds fdic. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:14:22
Well arn’t you lovely.   I was asking an honest question.  What is your thought process on why it’s going to roll back to 1k? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:27
I'd buy ledgers for each of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:49:41
and you said....
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:28:10
uhhh not gona happen in our lifetimes 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:05:50
Thank you for your statement. We will be reporting this back to wife.exe 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:07:39
What’s your logic on that statement? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:24:20
Can we pick the staples to be used? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:51:41
I really wish the fines against our banking industry would be in the form a multiple.  aka:  5x earning for best quarter during period where the offence took place. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:15:42

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:02:54
Get a cpa and financial advisor.   
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:15:11
I'd say keep them in all 3 and hang on.  
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:48:09
So electricity really isn't free then.  you have to pay off those panels and gear. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:59:42
so you have a shitload of extra solar just in case your farm needs it?   when it does do your miners go offline? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:40:30
what was your solar cost?  including batteries. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:47:05
If you;re over 250k in liquid you really should be talking with a financial advisor and cpa. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:53

@_date: 2018-04-04 20:20:40

@_date: 2013-11-18 19:02:10
When you look at the finite supply of them, logic would suggest the value is going to go up in time. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:30:25
Main stream news will fuck it up. They have a talent for that.
