100% agree with the relevant regardless of price point. But a victory for the bankers doesn't have to come by way of total crypto annihilation. Push the price to $1000 resulting in a 90% loss y/y and they will tout their "success" ad nauseum. BTC is on the world stage and so goes the price, so goes the confidence in it as a medium of transaction. Plenty of things in the world people find useful but in comparison to alternatives are logistically useless. Also, you've made no mention of exchange regulation, which was the point of my post and discussion I was starting. Plenty of other posts for you to blindly fanboy on.

I'm talking about eh future of Bitcoin, not if some people still make a profit if it drops to 2K. And you are fundamentally incorrect about not losing if not selling. Plenty of people hold stock from bankrupt companies that they never sold. Did they not lose. Plenty of people own GE stock at $50. Do you think they feel like they haven't lost. The bankers who care for nothing other than their profits will try to destroy Bitcoin if they see profit in it. Just because its a loss "on paper" does not mean that it isn't a loss. The opportunity cost in itself is alone tremendous. I've held since 2012 and believe in the future, but lets no be naive about peoples greed (bankers and hodler) and fear of loss (holdrs).

You're right, it's not. Go long, go short, convert to fiat, sleep well at night. Wake up, repeat.

The point is so that people can bet against all the other people who just want to buy it and to bet on what they think the future price might be with out the exposure or hacking/ban/tech risk. Its a financial instrument "derivative" for people to use to make money or to hedge risk.

Anyone who is familiar with this man knows his predictions are about as reliable as a broken clock. Those of us who also trade equities have watch this man "cast doubt" on the stock market, calling for "DOOM' and "Imminent collapse" since 2010. He been wrong...for the last 8 years. This is how he gets on TV and promotes his own interests. He resides somewhere between carnival barker and charlatan. This is the true definition of FUD. He made ONE good, but not unique call in 2007 and apparently earned himself a monthly appearance on financial TV show du jour to the end of time.
