Excellent news!

Here's what they did for us in the last couple of weeks. Suggested reading:

I imagine that is of a great concern to some of those posters who appear to be housewives or interesting in gardening with some kind of exotic plant. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 09:18:52
So who do you think did this work for the latest release: 
@_date: 2016-03-06 09:55:29
Yeah but I am a new users and I was not posting about juicers a few weeks ago :-)  I am just surprised by the fact we have some users who's posters would suggest they have no interest in software now posting about some fairly technical topics. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:04:13
One thing for sure they are doing what is in their best interests. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:48:21
My account is new, how can I buy one of these :-) ?
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:57:31
Should be up in a while when segwit gets implemented and before the Classic guys find the next thing to complain about.  If you take away this fake news then bitcoin has never looked in better shape.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:48:52
Can you send me a link.  My wife is good at complaining but has no reddit account.

I think it has nothing to do with Devs vs Miners.  Last time I checked the devs went to HK had a meeting with the miners and came back with an agreement. This is a fact and no need to reply saying whatever.  They came to agreement and announced it. 
The problem is the agreement is not in the best interests of Coinbase and so here we now have the situation where the Gavin and assorted collection of trolls come on here every 10 minutes to post reasons why the block size should be increased.  Never once do I see these posters saying anything about all the new technologies such as LN, micro-payment channels as a means to increase capacity. 
Same thing again and again and again and again repeated by a bunch of trolls saying sky is falling.

And what date was this? Do you realize just how much bitcoin has changed and how much has been learned since that time.  I used to say I will never get married but years later I got married.   
@_date: 2016-03-06 09:51:10
Okay thanks, now added you to the list of foolish users who have nothing really to say other than to repeat the same thing again and again and again.  
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:25:22
How funny. Do you really think a bunch of bitcoin redditors are the best people to decide what's needed? I'll leave it up to the professionals who have guided bitcoin over the last few years. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:22:59
Would you like everything to be rushed as soon as possible like they did for Ethereum and the dao before everything came falling down leading to huge problems for Ethereum?
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:35:20
After many months coinbase already just started to ask for more verification.  Already gave them everything twice!  What do they want now!   oh and the verification button doesn't work so I can't buy right now anyway. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:06:26
My buys are also on hold now after verifications before and after I've been buying for the last 2-3 months.  Interesting thing is I don't think I received any advance notice of this with email.  Just went to the buy page for the first time in a few days and now asked to click a button (that does not work) asking for more information.  Great work coinbase ! 
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:11:20
I did same and friend also had problems and ended up with a $25 / day limit so he ended up using a different exchange as he could not get past the ID verification of his US passport. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:12:42
I never had a problem until today. Suggest you try hitting the buy button.  You may find it does not work.
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:24:46
Ethereum is pretty much doomed at this point but interestingly the price is still holding up.  I would have expected it to be down to $2 or less by now. Any ideas what's keeping the price up?
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:23:51
Don't worry yourself over it.  The sky has not fallen down, my transactions all confirm quickly and the trolls are still busy as ever. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:06:29
haha seems like it.  They stopped my buys without warning after a long period of normal activity and after two verifications.  I wonder how many times they want to verify the same image of my passport or bank account?
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:05:21
I believe it was agreed that work would start putting together a hard fork proposal during the month of July. Don't you think it's a little early to start getting worried about this on July 1st ?
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:37:01
So if I write down something really technical in Chinese, make it looks real,  and post it on a forum would everyone believe that too?
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:27:43
I am not qualified to say if I am for or against anything. I leave it up to the experts which clearly both you and I are not. ps. Your posts might be better received if you stick to posting on r/btc with the other trolls. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:37:48
Good idea.  Give up on the 100+ core developers and move to the part-time one single developer classic product.  Pure stupid FUD.
