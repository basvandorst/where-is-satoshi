looks to me it was also just a profit taking, since the price was exactly 1000.00 euro

China doest everyting to lower the bitcoin price. Stop buying the BS
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:20:56
Exactly 1000 euro was hit....psychological profit number. No biggy...price will be back in 2 days.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:14:39
Dont really get why this is a big connection. What if the ETF is approved. Then Wall street will pump millions in bitcoin making the chinese richer. Why would the chinese government dont like there people getting richer? They dont like money leaving there country, but this is the opposite?
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:30:39
China will adopt bitcoin like Japan has. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:08:20
Is there something as the hashrate becoming too high or is it all just positive? Governement computer joining the network to test there influence capacity options?

Bitcoin finally is going strong worldwide. This is the time to strike and make it a possible option to counter FIAT. To benefit all users we need a sollution NOW. Even if SegWit is not the best choice, it is the only fully programmed and tested option to implement NOW. All parties agree that we need bigger blogs. Lets build it after SegWit.

as a basic, positive faith in bitcoin
more adoption
more acceptance
and segwit :)
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:36:59
11th of March is the ultimate deadline, so I think it will be sooner like last time..
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:22:12
They can just rebrand and try again? There are other ETF request, so im sure there is always a way to try again in another format.

Smart move. Hold on to the end of 2020 (next halvening) and dont be temped to trade, because 9 out of 10 you lose money.

better buy now.. 
With the effects of PBoC announcements weakening, possible COIN ETF approval on March 11th, and technicals leaning extremely bullish, price projections between $1440-1580 may soon become a reality.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:19:23
I really dont care about the pros and cons of Segwit/BU. I just dont want a far smaller and less skilled dev-team working on bitcoin, especially not making a hardfork!

@_date: 2017-03-18 21:58:51
wait till the price of btc is down to 500usd and see what the BU miners decide... my guess is they figured out if btc dies of like that its bad for business..

Both parties fear each other of a 51% attack if they HF. Roger already said the would dump his 100k coins on the BCC chain
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:23:02
Im not buying it. The price was exactly 1000.00 euro, so it looks more like a profit take to me.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:36:36
why to the upside? because it also went up when the blocked people?
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:14:32
There is no technical or other reason why it cannot reach 5000usd. Since the potential and already market penetration of bitcoin it will happen in X amount of time.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:11:11
I think it will have more impact if Ver sells all his coins in one time on the segwit chain :(
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:51:06
just wait till this saturday and post again :)
im 100% certain it will tank..
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:14:16
If there is a HF and the bitcoin hashrate gets split into 50/50  (it seems segwit/bu are 50/50 divided), is the security of both networks in danger?
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:01:38
Every hour that passes it becomes more logical that they wont make a decisions.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:34:32
Bitcoin runs on miners. Miners earn much more money with BU and they have more control. They dont like to lose this.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:48:55
Yes, until the ETF bitcoin honey pot gets hacked and bitcoin tanks to 500USD again.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:23:28
if BTC/BTU splits by HF, then Roger will dump all his BTC on core's segwit-chain price will tank?
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:48:59
this drop isnt a single event...aslong as the HF lures...nobody dares to hold big money....I can see 550usd
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:23:35
buy on the rumor, sell on the news...
it will tank eitherway back to the trendline and 100EMA. 
no worries...we will see 2000usd in 2 months.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:13:09
segwit and just bitcoin going mainstream (spotify, netflix, ebay, aliepress, uber, airbnb,amazone, etc...)

@_date: 2017-03-13 11:09:35
For now it seems the community is 50/50. If bitcoin forks it might not be bad in the long run. My only concern is that 50% hashrate (1.75 TH/s?) might be temporary vulnerable to attacks? Has anybody an idea on this scenario?
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:45:05
 ?
BU = for the miners,  
SegWit = for the people
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:38:48
and what would they do exactly?
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:25:51
this is the reason why the ETF will not be approved (although they will not say)... they want to be able to demonetize bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:40:48
pullback to 1050 usd is healthy for a big up to 1400usd

Great news. Lets see what the price does. Will we see a big pullback before everything settles?
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:14:05
I just cant understand why he just let core go for SegWit. It will drive the price up to 3000USD and he can retire as a multi multi millionair. Buy a big boat and enjoy the caribbean.

The huge deal here is that there are 2 ETF approvals (Winkelvoss and SolidX) in january 2017 that might get through so these millionairs/billionairs can spend big money in BTC. It not like you to go poloniex and put 100million in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-15 10:16:08
Now that the leverage is prohibited in china. It is mathematical impossible that bitcoin can go to 40k in short amount of time?

Im just hoping the price wont drop below 700USD, because no matter how positive the news is...if it mentions china/audits/regulation, the price drops...
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:50:55
I think this is excellent news! The big crash from 1166USD was due to massive margin trading debt pay off. This cant happen anymore since its prohibited in china.

May be approved, may attract, may this, may that... this is no news, this is a rumor..

Bitcoin technology meaning just the PoW blockchain tech? This has nothing todo with the bitcoin ledger thus price influence?!
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:21:25
I was thinking about monero, but future releases of bitcoin will also have anonymity...so I dont see a great future for monero in a year or so? The are also working on smartcontracts for bitcoin...so ethereum is also a questionmark to me.

on what legal grounds will they do that?
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:00:23
lol...looking for a good buy back? :) 
There are pretty bright minds that think you should hold on.. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 09:44:29
They will not be pro bitcoin if they cant tax it properly. The government needs money, so they cant have a system that make them lose money.

Bitcoin cant be hacked, exchanges like coinbase can be hacked. So just take your bitcoin from the exchanges and cold store them.

We need Segwit aka SCALING asap...!! Let them talk about the blocksize after thats online. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 13:43:29
Bitcoin might go down to around 850 for a quick bounch up to new ATH. However...there are no banksters. They only thing banksters of government can do is buy up bitcoins and they are welcome to make us rich.
@_date: 2016-12-28 13:44:07
both will hit this target in 3 days....but dowjones will crash in january and bitcoin will burst up (like gold/silver).

Drugs is also illegal. They seem to have it all under control :) Fact is that it only gets more popular when you make something illegal. They better make it legal and tax it.

bitcoin is going for the tipping point of critical mass adoption(!)
- CLSA Sees China's Yuan Plunging 19% by 2017 in Most Bearish Call; 
- ETF Winkelvos for bitcoin on 10 januari; 
- Megaupload 2.0 (Bitcache)is set for release on January 27, 2017; 
- ETF SolidX Bitcoin Trust (XBTC) decision 29 jan;

This is really good.
Now they need to make it law to use trading fees, so bots cant trade unlimited.
@_date: 2016-12-27 07:33:41
Lets just hope he can compromise with segwit. He says bitcoin will suffer with segwit and bitcoin has no future the way things are going now. Lets hope the bitcoin Jesus doesnt destroy bitcoin with his ego.

Core and BU should do humanity a favor and come together to make a deal on scaling. The world needs bitcoin NOW !
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:54:44
Maybe they can settle the lawsuit on the agreement that they signal for segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-23 09:42:33
YOU have been scammed?
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:37:43
obviously... 
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:53:07
So now hackers worldwide will try and make use of this backdoor for themselfs (maybe even try to use it for DDOS purpose)... maybe even governments will try to shutdown these miners with this backdoor?
@_date: 2017-04-24 07:15:31
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:30:37
with 130k bitcoin he can hold this up for 338 months, 28years
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:11:46
All sides should stop bitching and come together to scale. Its a duty to humanity to come to consensus as we all need bitcoin as a currency NOW.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:44:15
@_date: 2017-04-21 07:06:16
imagine what the price will do if segwit is anticipated
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:32:30
So is there danger to the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:24:03
omg this is serious....antpool can use a DDOS style attack on other blockchains with there sold devices...   Is this deliberate backdoor without informing there customers even legal? Can Antpool be sued over this? Will they be sued?
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:33:06
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:28:58
Just thought about the price of bitcoin is Ver's coins were frozen...
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:00:13
Its core's first suggestion, but ofcourse they can change it. Segwit will happen this year. Just a matter of when.
@_date: 2017-04-16 09:14:24
it makes bitcoin more valuable

If this guy really is satoshi and he has 1 million+ bitcoins...why does he bother selling companies..
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:33:33
True, we should ask everybody in the world not to attack the network that contains 20 billion usd. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:53:30
So now hackers worldwide will try and make use of this backdoor for themselfs (maybe even try to use it for DDOS purpose)... maybe even governments will try to shutdown these miners with this backdoor?
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:25:33
Is this a trend or the normal exponential adoption rate? If this is normal we early adaptors will all be driving lambo's in 2 years.
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:19:26
who else in the future?
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:56:46
Maybe they can settle the upcoming lawsuit on the agreement that they signal for segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:29:22
UASF should be known by the end of next month...then 2/3 months implementation?
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:37:42
BU is to stall, because no company on earth like to miss out on 20/30% profits. It fair they do this, but now others can act and block it.
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:11:27
We need scaling NOW. Power to the people (SegWit) and not money to _extra_ profits for miners! Japan is about to explode with bitcoin for retailers this summer!
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:54:26
Maybe they can settle the lawsuit on the agreement that they signal for segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:05:57
UASF = Power to the People
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:50:57
Core will get Segwit in this year. They only are planning to time it correctly with the least amount of resistance. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 06:36:56
so what problem is there then? people who like to use segwit do and others dont?
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:42:46
Good luck with your businessplan electricty bill setback in china 
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:45:15
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:58:55
BU is defending chinese miners from 20/30% extra mining efficiency. Now the chinese government are making they pay extra for there electricity :) 
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:57:21
Maybe they can settle the upcoming lawsuit on the agreement that they signal for segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:07:59
No bitcoin is never a safe investment...LIKE ALL OTHER STOCKS. 
It is how ever a very good risk/reward ratio asset. I would def advice to buy some and hold is atleast till the next halvening (3 years)
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:11:30
maybe not so aggressively
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:43:19
omg...we just started day 1....just wait a year orso...we need segwit/lightning for fast confirmations and easier phone apps to pay with nfc. We are just getting started!
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:56:28
Maybe they can settle the upcoming lawsuit on the agreement that they signal for segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-13 12:40:24
BU is 3v1l
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:17:29
Now BU is at 33.9% I didnt catch the miner that left?
Beside there ASICboost problem if Segwit gets in....the Chinese miners might have another problem on there hand: 
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:41:50
Its chinese miners getting rekt by government over electricty bill :) 
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:03:50
Ofcourse. You can buy 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin if you want.
@_date: 2017-04-18 05:24:04

The chinese government now claims the ASICboost bonus :) 
@_date: 2017-04-17 07:27:09
its more obvious to me that bitfury will start developing chips that also support asicboost.
@_date: 2016-12-22 07:59:52
you must be mad to sell from now on.. just wait till end of 2020 (next halving) and retire.. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:00:43
So now hackers worldwide will try and make use of this backdoor for there purpose or governments will try to shutdown these miners?
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:29:57
To me its 100% that Segwit is getting pushed in. Only question is what will happen to the price the first 6 months. Its extremely bullish for bitcoin, but Ver promised he is dumping his 100+k coins (making himself poor).
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:42:21

@_date: 2017-04-18 13:15:26
if bitfinex stops and the bitcoins are lost...its bullish for bitcoin? it makes bitcoins more rare. There are a lot more exchanges now a days, so I dont see a bitcoin price danger?

@_date: 2017-04-08 08:28:04
What if...BU miners first borrow all the money they can get. Buy bitcoin with 5x leverage and then tweet out they accept Segwit. They will earn more money in 2 weeks then they can do mining without ASICboost the next couple of years..

Its far better to sell after such a big run up and set a lower buy target. This also makes you money...and more safe in this situation. Expecting today atleast 100usd correction, but wont be surprised it is going to be 30% to the daily 50 EMA.
