Sell while you're ahead! Bitcoin to 0 by march!

While bitcoin is dipping, you should read about other markets (mainly stocks) and perhaps learn how to diversify. :)
I'm up 25% in 7 months from equities. Sounds slow compared to bitcoin, but at least it has actual value, is recognized internationally, and won't dip 50% in a month. 
Also now I can sell some stock and buy some more bitcoin now that it's at 11k.

Hey shut up with your logic! 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:29:06
No it isn't.

Bitcoin is speculation that can result in anything, including a complete loss of your principal. I.e. 0 dollar
But likely it won't even go past 8k is my bet. I think it'll probably turn around before 10k even

Not really.

And it worked. Some of the top responses are about how "there is a 90% chance that bitcoin will grow" based on this article

Yeah, he should mortgage his home, use his student loans, and/or sell a kidney. Throw it all on bitcoin:)

You actually do have to opt in to overdraft fees when signing up for your bank account...

Low but positive inflation is considered a good thing. Unless you want people to hoard cash and not participate in the economy.

You're poor. Or more poor. Good morning :)

People laugh to cope with traumatic situations.
It's ok friend. You can always just retire at 80.

Enjoy your riches and don't look back man. Congrats on the gains.

No, it isn't. No one with any modicum of investing knowledge pays 2.5%. 
My largest fund has an expense ratio of 0.03% and my stocks are all, obviously, 0%.
Stop spouting bullshit

Yeah he actually is. Literally 100% of his post was wrong. 
No one says stocks are a good store of value. They're risky. Funnily enough, bitcoin is a shotty store of value and is way way worse than risky stocks. 
The fees also aren't 2.5%. I pay something like a couple dollars to buy 70k USD of stock. You pay 30 bucks to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin.
And just because you don't understand a valuation or because rare companies illegally  lie or fudge financials doesn't mean the other 99.99% are magic. This is also hilarious coming from a subreddit where bitcoin is given hilarious valuations all of the time.

Yep, those plant bulbs sure were pretty revolutionary at the time, too. They were rather unique and beautiful I hear.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:54:52
You're right. Tulip bulbs didn't go to zero either. They just became mostly worthless.

Get a few accountants and lawyers and cash it out and pay only a little bit in income tax and the rest in long term capital gains.

A share of stock is a piece of ownership in a company. If the stock market 'crashes' you lose maybe 40-50% of the value in U.S. dollars but still own equity in companies. If bitcoin crashes it can go to literally 0. And you own no physical asset or legally recognised business equity or anything else. You have some math tied to some other math.
