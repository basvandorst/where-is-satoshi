"fast" is the pun.... 
Depending on what you order and if they have it in stock will determine how early you receive your order.  They buy wholesale so you have to really watch their lead time.
(Pre Order) (On Order) (In Stock)
You have to be very patient if it is not in stock.  
Batteries are another terrible thing to order.  China's regulation on shipping batteries are very strict and add additional time for transit.
That being said; If you can wait and want a good price this place is awesome.

Ah, sorry for the late post then.  I just noticed and was giddy.  
They use BitPay as the back-end to handle the transaction.

Did you pay with a fully funded paypal account or use paypal as a pass-through for your credit card?
I paid with my CC through paypal and ended up filing a charge-back with my CC and they are now working with paypal to get my money back.
Paypal will re-open a post 45 day claim if you speak to them over the phone.  Explain that this was not a pre-order and unknowingly violated paypal policies.  I also had the paypal rep google "butterfly labs scam" and she quickly re-opened my claim and got a manager.
this site also helped when reviewing the terms/claims about date estimates.
Technicially I am still in limbo because BFL has not sent paypal back the money.  They have not responded to any communication from me, paypal, or my CC.  My order on BFL says "Complete / Cancelled"

you are a shill &amp; correct.  i am sure that me getting my investment will make the next delusional person happy. anyone that receives their orders now will not reach ROI so good luck to anyone still waiting for the 65nm chips from BFL.  i congratulate bfl on pulling the wool over the hopeful public's eye
