Everybody gets rich off Bitcoin except Bitcoiners. It's something you people just fail to realize. 
Here's a hint. All these investments from all these companies and how many bitcoins are they buying exactly?
Yes, that's right. None. Not 1 coin. They're not touching that shit. They're too busy taking dirty fiat dollars from Bitcoiners. And the Bitcoiners absolutely love it. 
Stockholm syndrome.

It's so odd how with these general finance news items the op's never post what it has to do with Bitcoin. Really never!
And when asked you always get some smart ass reply like "it's obvious" or "figure it out".
Let me try it again anyway. Why don't you tell us what this has to do with Bitcoin?

The US is bullish on Bitcoin?? What? 
Who exactly are the US and how many coins did they buy? Can't wait for your answer. Seriously.

Where is the racism part?
Really, if this is already racism to you then you must be policitally correct beyond anything i've ever seen. The thought alone already makes me sick.
