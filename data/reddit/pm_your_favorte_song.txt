Right now large scale, efficient energy storage doesn't really exist. I don't know the exact thermodynamics behind it but I think that mining bitcoin with left over energy is more efficient than building huge batteries with our current technology. Also I think the model for adoption of the two schemes favors Bitcoin mining a lot. 
If we were to employ your battery strategy then a company with lots of capital would have to invest in expensive materials for cutting edge batteries and then ship them around world (wasting a LOT of coal/oil for transportation!). The costs involved in setting this up are probably prohibitive which is why we don't see anyone doing it.
On the otherhand, any average Joe in a region that has cheaper (excess) energy can invest in some mining rigs and turn a profit on the cheap energy. What Demeester is suggesting isn't that this is some magical energy transportation scheme but that we can create value from energy that would otherwise be lost because we have no good way to utilize it.

Except that you can't magically turn Icelandic geothermal energy or Saharan solar energy into oil or coal. The energy lost in the mining/transaction process is irrelevant if the energy would otherwise be thrown away.

I think pizza is a bad example as the 10 min confirmation time is nicely aligned with the time you need to wait for the pizza to be made, but obviously what you're saying is right. I don't want to have to wait 10 minutes when I pay for my groceries.
