I bought at 8,217. If it dips to 3k I will stop doing whatever I am doing and buy $100 worth.

Yeah being poor sucks :(

Bought at 8k decided it wouldn’t dip below 4K but wanted to stop a chance of it hitting 25k before buying. Once it dropped back to 6k I bought more. Overall not upset with my purchases.

Interesting.

Coinbase. Idk how helpful that is to you.

Well I don’t know how the new exchange places operate. I figured that it wouldn’t be that simple but just inquiring as to whether he read the terms of service upon signing up. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:37:47
Well what about their terms of service? Does it mention that they own your account and your just using it?
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:17:16
Sounds about right lol
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:00:00
Right but if the terms of service states that they have the right to terminate your account at any point for breaking any rules, such as maybe buying and selling to unauthorized places then maybe that’s what happened in this case.

It’s very possible. But regardless Banks are opposed to bitcoin. I’d say if you OP are 100% sure that you’re not trading illegally, then get a lawyer and fight it.

Under that assumption I’m on your side. Lol I was just questioning whether or not they have some rule that allows them to do what they did. If they don’t have some loophole then I’m assuming getting a lawyer will win him something.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:40:16
I’d mention that you’re looking into getting a lawyer and see what that live chat tells you.

Wait are you saying you were audited by the IRS and slapped with a fine of $200,000 in tax evasion for not claiming video game currency?

Does their terms of service say that you only use the accounts and not own them? Also is your bank attached to it? Some banks have been very against Bitcoin and may have sent Kraken something to close your account.

And if his bank is connected then possibly his bank too.

I believe this guys comment is overlooked. Naturally you do not own WOW coins. Blizzard does. They already do taxes. Bitcoin varies in that there is no single entity that owns it that could potentially take it away being the rightful owners.

As in you may owe money?
