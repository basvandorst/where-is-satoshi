Bitcoins money is flowing into ETC at the moment. Massive amounts. That's why the price drops and will continue to drop.

I'd also suggest to leave your country. Go in a tax haven. Nice island in the Caribbean maybe.

1 year is way to less. There's a ton of addresses like that but still in use. Make it 3 years and no incoming transactions either and you might have a bit a more proper number.

I'm following the path Venezuela is taking since over 15 years. It was clear from the start to what Chavez will transform it. I saw friends leaving Caracas after it was clear to them that their business there isn't sustainable anymore. 
A populist became president. A guy who put anyone in his inner circle in places of power. Sure, have the power plants under control of people who have no idea about what they are doing and then wonder why it's suddenly dark. 
I don't know in what ideology you are stuck. Maybe it's USA bashing or a glorification of corrupt systems with leaders who talk about freedom and fill their pockets worse than others, but if one of us has to do some research it's clearly you.

You definitely have around 3 of my addresses in there then. And they aren't abandoned. Not much value, but I'm sure there are a lot others who have value. With just 1 year I'll take your number and divide it by 6. As I estimate that for every abandoned address you catch you get a greater number of storage spaces in your pool.

Ah, I was right. USA bashing is the reason. Look, I took one look at Chavez when he came to power and said: "This country will go to shit". And it did. Had nothing to do with the US.
I say the same now with Turkey and Erdogan. It's no rocket science really. Narcissistic people - like Trump - ruin countries if allowed to stay in leading positions, simple as that.

Oh my, I feel sorry for any dumb-ass buying into that. The country is basically bankrupt and so they look for a magical way out of the self made misery. 
A real magical way would be open and fair elections, respecting the courts, demonstrations, a stop of willful nationalization of private property, trying to unite and not separate the country, a stop to nepotism and that damn populism really helps nobody. But populism lately got popular in quite a few corners of the world.

I'll give it a go! Thanks for the work you put into it, so or so. It's a cool idea, with a bit of tweaking it's helpful.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:52:18
Actually not. Guess I wasn't the first one with that idea. Will look into it, thanks!

Why? You can still tax income and I could as well go and buy with my money a gold bar somewhere. Nobody would know I have it. Same like Bitcoin. The state could also tax exchanges.

If I would be Russian I would change my money now to Bitcoins. The ruble is loosing value fast. If Bitcoins are affected at all I'd say just in a positive way.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:34:04
I second this. I started with Bitcoin and had a lot of Litecoins. But the whole negative attitude, hate and anger really drove me away. Sold most Lite- and Bitcoins for Doge. 
I've never seen myself as one side or another. I bought a bit here, a bit there, mined a bit this and that. We are all in this together, and especially Litecoin and Bitcoin now really have nothing to fear. 
So I thought, but I see so much love in Dogecoin and so much Greed/Hate in some other Cryptos, it's just sad. 
How about we concentrate to get the currencies mainstream? Now isn't that a goal we all share?

Simple question: You want a good product or rushed out crap? If there are flaws they need to be fixed. I see to many companies pleasing their marketing department or holding and keeping deadlines just to put an unfinished product to the market.

Shibe here. I don't think it's banned from the Doge subreddit. That would be wrong, I and most shibes would welcome to be tipped, no matter if in Bitcoin or Doge.

No this is not me. Why do you assume this? Or did you just try to insult me? Ah right, I forgot, I'm out of the friendly Dogecoin subreddit. But to your questions:
If you work for a company and get a paycheck the state knows what your income is. That has nothing to do with the currency that is used to pay you. Of course papers can be faked, but they also can if you get payed in any other currency. Money can be given cash in your hand and no traces are left. 
If you have an income trough Bitcoin mining it's different. That cannot be traced. But sell books online and spread the income over some accounts and nobody can ever tell. No difference.

Those two sides are soooo much divided, there clearly will be a fork sooner or later. The question is not if, but when. 
BU has now what... 40% of 75% necessary? And that dickhead Chandler is switching too now? Might happen quite soon. Fools shoot their own foot everyday.

You think people buy Bitcoin to make money. 
That is only half the truth. People who don't - yet - understand Bitcoin buy it to make money, while people who do understand it buy it because they are fed up with the rotten financial system that gives banks and the government an unfair house edge.
They are fed up that they enrich themselves while you are stuck in a system that isn't sustainable. Stuck in a system that makes your wealth decline on default.
And THAT's why we aren't in a bubble. It didn't make "click" right away by me either, but in time it does, and there is no going back. 
Also I laugh about bank coins and government coins. Talk wolf in sheeplefluff.

I need to get money from A to B, so really, whatever does the job does it, and BTC seems not to do that job at the moment as reliable as others, so the sarcasm just really confirms my thoughts of a total ignorance in the BTC sphere at the moment.

Holy fuck, okay, whoever is threatening legal and patent action in the Bitcoin sphere is automatically my enemy and has lost all and every support he might have had!
The ability to fork is an important one and while I might not agree with your fork, I will defend with everything I have the right to do so!

Who cares? Concentrate on the tech and innovations. It was a huge ride up, now it's a huge correction. High time that anyone who invested in crap icos and scams has to second-guess his investment. 
If you believe in the tech and what the blockchain can do and you did your homework when investing in your coins you will sleep quite sound.

Is anyone really surprised? I mean it's the US, the country straight out of Idiocracy. It's going down  the drain since a long time, since they allowed coorperations to take over. Why anyone would want to live there is behind my grasp.
But it's only one country, and one on a fast downward spiral. Freedom my ass.
Companies will just settle in more modern and tech friendly places. And China might once more see a chance to pick up a win for itself.

You didn't travel extensively. I usually meet 2 types of Americans. The ones who travel a lot or even live abroad and the ones who think it counts to travel inside the US. The first group never talks like you do, only the second group. 
The first group usually realizes how freeing it is to be actually out of the US and how much is wrong with that country. 
I did travel half the world and I'm spending every year at least 6 months in different countries, and the US is rock bottom on my list of places I want to live. Just above Pakistan and the likes.
It's an oppressive and dumbed down country. 
Don't get me wrong, I love the US people! I am very thankful for what you guys did in WW2 and the Americans I meet are cool people. Super friendly. But the country itself is a real shit-hole unfortunately.
