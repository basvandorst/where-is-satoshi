Coinbase issued 1099K’s as a result of the summons from the Department of Justice. Under US law, income has to be reported whether or not you receive tax documents such as 1099K, 1099-MISC, etc.

With respect to specific lot identification, the identification must take place before the end of the settlement date. One idea for documenting this, is to send yourself an email so that you have a time stamp.

If you sell for the same or less, you are correct. However, see our other responses with regards to using losses to offset other income.

The 3.8% net investment income tax under Obamacare applies above a certain total income amount. Self-employment tax (social security and medicare tax) on self-employment income probably only applies to regular cryptocurrency mining activity.

Mining will give rise to ordinary income and expenses. If the activity of mining is substantial as trade or business, this might subject net income from this activity to self-employment tax. This is a fact and circumstances driven area. If the equipment was used in a trade or business, various expensing and depreciation options may be considered too.

For people subject to US taxation (US citizens, green card holders and US residents), spending cryptocurrency is deemed to be “selling” cryptocurrency for USD at the value of whatever you purchase/spent it on. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:59:13
The quick answer is maybe, but not directly. It depends on the facts and circumstances. 
Generally, there are two different ways to profit from cryptocurrency. The first is trading, buying and selling, which will give rise to capital gain treatment on gains and losses.  The second is mining which will give rise to ordinary income and expenses. If the activity of mining is substantial as trade or business, this might subject net income from this activity to self-employment tax. This is a fact and circumstances driven area. If the equipment was used in a trade or business, various expensing and depreciation options may be considered too.

Presumably, you would show a cost basis of $5,000 on date X and adjusted sales proceeds of $5,200 on date Y for a net gain of $200.

Your CPA will need information that can be easily entered onto Form 8949. 
You could either prepare a spreadsheet with that information or use one of the online tools that will provide a pro forma form 8949. Some tools are free below a certain number of transactions. The problem with a spreadsheet will be allocating your cost basis among different sales and tracking cost basis going forward. The online tools should do that for you. 
In the end, the more organized you are and the better your documentation, the less time it will take your CPA to prepare your tax return. Time is money. $

If you got a 1099K, then almost certainly the IRS has it as well. 1099Ks are usually not reported to the states as well, but many states have information sharing agreements with the IRS, and vice versa.  
All that really means is that you should be reporting gross sales of cryptocurrency at least to the extent of the 1099K amount, regardless of whether you have a net gain or loss overall. The IRS doesn't have any cost basis information, so you have to provide that on your tax return to offset the gross amounts. 
This is similar to the old 1099-B issue with stock sales when the IRS wasn't provided cost basis information. The taxpayer could be trading daily with large net losses. Since the IRS only had the gross sales proceeds, they only saw income. Taxpayers had to provide the cost basis information.

Taxable events include: 1) mining new cryptocurrency, 2) sale or exchange of cryptocurrency for currency or cryptocurrency, 3) according to some, when you have a “fork” event.

Through December 31, 2017, you may be eligible to claim a casualty loss on your itemized deductions. Beginning January 1, 2018, casualty losses only apply to property lost in a federally declared disaster area (FEMA). Otherwise, you would declare a capital loss.

Yes, your clock restarts. However, if you did a partial sale, the clock does not reset on the portion not sold.

At this point, there is no specific guidance. FIFO method seems to be safest from a government challenge. There may be an argument to use LIFO and specific lot identification methodology. It’s important to keep and maintain detailed records to support the method used.

See answers above related to what constitutes a taxable event. Converting cryptocurrency to US currency is a taxable event on its own. Transferring US dollars from the exchange to your bank account is not.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:46:33
Generally yes, for wagers using cryptocurrency in a gambling environment, ex. an online casino. Otherwise, not.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:09
Safest: The short answer is to recognize the forked currency as ordinary income based on the fair market value on the date received, with no cost basis. The IRS has not issued any formal guidance on this. We will come back to this question later to discuss other methods. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:27:27
Excellent question. The answer is yes, and your cost basis is whatever was reported on your 2013 W-2 related the payment in Bitcoin. When you sell, you will tell the IRS what your cost basis is on form 8949.

Generally, yes. Potentially you might have deductions associated with this mining activity.

All sales need to be shown, but you could aggregate sales of the same cryptocurrency on the same date. Cost basis needs to be apportioned to each sale. You could aggregate cost basis from multiple lots or multiple dates and apportion them to a single sale with a date description of “various”.

If you have a large increase in income year over year, then the estimated tax penalty will be based on your prior year tax liability, which was much lower. In that case, as long as you've covered 110% of the prior year's liability, then you will stop the penalties and pay the balance due by April 15th. The 110% could be 90% if your income is below a certain threshold. Please be in touch with us if you would like more help. crypto

Yes. It does not matter if you convert into fiat. See answer above for treatment of conversion from crypto to crypto.

The form does not allow for thousands of pages. You can put a summary totals on the appropriate locations on the form. Further, you can attach your detail schedule to your return. Some people believe that you can put "available upon request" in the description in lieu of detail attachments. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:26:03
It should, no matter your business, since the form is transmitted to the IRS. It is not clear to us at this time what the IRS matching protocol is for 1099-Ks, but it would be an issue if you were audited. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:15:43
Your detailed records should be sufficient to support the gain or loss reported on your tax return meaning that you should be able to account for every transaction showing cost, proceeds, and any investment expenses related to that. The keyword phrase here is "every transaction." Also note that the IRS is known to accept reasonable estimates in certain situations. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:31:19
See answer above regarding timing and documentation.

We "obviously" agree. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:19:44
If the price of BTC did not change, then it doesn’t really make a difference because you bought and sold BTC at the same rate for $0 gain. If there is a price fluctuation, you would have a short-term gain or loss on the BTC transaction. Due to the volatility of the cryptocurrencies it’s unlikely that you can ignore the BTC trade.

Reposted from elsewhere:
Most people believe that it is a taxable event. Prior to 2018, there may be an argument that conversion of one cryptocurrency to another qualifies for like-kind exchange treatment. However, no official guidance is available for 2017 and prior.  
Even if you have no other income or expenses in 2017, you would still need to file a tax return provided that you want to take a position that crypto to crypto is subject to like-kind exchange, you would have to fill out form 8824. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:19:09
It depends on your total asset base when you leave, and a few other factors. The IRS has an information page with more detail here:  
Below the threshold, there would be no taxable event.

Yes. Currently, there are three long-term capital gain brackets for US Federal income tax: 0%, 15%, and 20%. Most states do not have different tax rates on ordinary income and capital gain. Massachusetts, for example, is a notable exception for short-term capital gains.

Yes. In addition you may have a reporting requirement on your individual return with form 8938.

In general:
The first method is to pick up ordinary income at the price of the forked currency when you took possession of that forked currency. Taking possession is the critical aspect. 
The second one is you allocate basis based on either fair market value or the number of forked currency that you received. In this case, no income is deemed to be received at this time. 
The third is to pick up no income and allocate no basis.
At this time, the IRS has issued no guidance on how this transaction should be taxed.

Best to report losses. 1) You can use up to $3,000 per year in net capital losses to offset other ordinary income. 2) Any excess carries forward to future years. Most states use the same methodology. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:30:06
We believe that average cost is not a valid method since it's usually only available for mutual funds. Highest-Cost First-Out or Highest-Price First-Out would fall under the category of specific lot identification. As we said above, specific lot identification must have before the end of the settlement date and cannot be retroactive after the fact.

In 2017, the annual gift exclusion amount was $14,000 per donor per recipient. In 2018, the exclusion amount has increased to $15,000. The lifetime unified estate and gift exclusion amount, for gifts in excess of the annual exclusion amount, was $5,490,000 per person in 2017. That amount has now increased to approximately $11,180,000 per person in 2018, and increases using the new inflation index. We say “approximately” because the new CPI inflation index has not yet been calculated, so the increase cannot be determined. 
Gifts in excess of the annual exclusion amounts need to be reported on a gift tax return, which generally has the same filing deadline as the individual income tax return, plus extensions. Gift and GST tax compliance is one of the more complicated areas of tax law, and the 5 page gift tax return is often not as simple as it looks. Speak to your CPA or trust &amp; estates attorney before you do something, as there are often ways to transfer assets more tax efficiently.
