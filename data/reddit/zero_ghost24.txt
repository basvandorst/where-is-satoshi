Amazon won't ever use Bitcoin.  Why would anyone use it as a currency?  I will get banned as anyone in the know understands the heavy censorship that takes place in this toxic subreddit.  But with its high transaction fees and LOOOOONG transaction wait times, who the fuck would use bitcoin as a currency?

You also can't day trade on coinbase, not in any profitable way.  Sure, CC/Debit cards are instant delivery of coins/tokens but the limits are often so low.  
You know a lot of stuff.  Perhaps try this debating stuff when you are sober.

Now you know my portfolio? lol
Go to bed and sober up.

I see you skirted around addressing anything I actually said and just stuck with talking about Bitcoin's high price.
High transaction fees.  Long transaction wait times.  The context was Amazon using/accepting bitcoin.

Except all the coins based on the Ethereum blockchain .

me too.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:01:22
Indeed, it is.

Hah. He made nice and went to bed to sober up. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:55:42
fair enough with what you just said.    
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:42:08
Oh okay.
So what are your thoughts on Bitcoin being used a currency with its high transaction fees and wait times?
How much does it cost if I want to send (pay for something) with oh say, $100 worth of Bitcoin?  How much is that going to run me in fees?

So when the value of your bitcoin drops hundreds of dollars, you then sell some of your bitcoin and then buy more. 
Buy High, sell low. Good strategy
Your words. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:42:56
Lol, k bro.  Right
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:54:16
So you are day trading your bitcoin for the 2 other coins that coinbase offers, LTC or ETH while paying those 4% CC/Debit card fees? 
Okay. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:44:20
I believe that you are drunk.  We agree on that. 
What coin did I shill for? Quote me, I won't edit anything I wrote.  Waiting.
Amazon purchasing crypto domains ( to resell) is a long ways from "amazon accepts bitcoin"
