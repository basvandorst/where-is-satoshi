Their currency is not worthless just because of the number of units.  
It's now worthless because nobody values it.

This is comparing apples to oranges.
Tumbling racks up btc transaction volume.
Change address counts everything.
Completely meaningless to compare.
This is like holding a dollar between me and a friends leather wallet and having it hooked up to a microchip to vibrate in the giga-herz range, then claiming we made trillions of dollars in transactions.  Fucking retarded.

That is the real problem with alt coins.
Imagine Monero gets even halway BTC's market share.
BTC will fork and clone it's code, using the superior ledger people will use the BTC fork instead.

This isn't really inflation.  It's not so high because there is just more money around.  There is but not to that degree.
It's complete distrust in the currency.
It's not worth anything because nobody believes it is worth anything.  It no longer matters how many units of said currency are around.
If you for BTC you have a coin with the same # as BTC.  It's not worthless because of inflation.  It's worthless because nobody thinks it's worth anything.

It is a very hard tax fraud case to bring.
First off, ignorance is an excuse so not knowing you needed to file it stops it from being fraud right there.
Second off, they would need crypto experts to process said case, costing more than $10,000 immediately.
Third off, they have to somehow prove you were selling your coins for more than you bought them for but there is no good way to do this.  You can show the average price that day but then you can see a stupid spike where somebody messed up a sell order and sold a BTC for $1.
Fourth off, they have to prove you even received anything for the coins.  GL proving you own the address that has the other crypto you traded into.
also, "Show me the wallet that held 10 bitcoin for the last year" you can just pick any random address groups with 10 BTC in it.  Actually I would just tell them I don't know how to do that and they can't have my wallet to peak because that would be giving them the money so they can't get fucked.

That is how they are 'seized', they give them the key 99.9% as a deal.
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:21:54
This.  If you bought at 10k you did it to hodl for years, or you are daytrading like a crazy person and must be rich.
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:55:32
Are those the same ones that said BTC will go to 0?
why do people listen to them again?
The US can't default on it's loans btw it will just print money and sit at 10%/year inflation for a decade or two.
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:09:17
That is not how it works at all.
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:14:02
They give up security for speed, that is all.
Any advantageous mechanisms the Alt coins are using can be copied and used with the BTC ledger instead, which is a better ledger than that alt coin's.
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:07:33
They can't be, if they were in any capacity they could still buy all of BTC.  The marketcap is smaller than apple's cash on hand, 1/8th of Amazon.  Any population really buying in would make it soar.
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:05:12
The address creation between ETH and BTC is very similar, just a different algorithm.  
You can fork the BTC ledger and copy ETH programming, copy Monero, Etc.
That is why people want BTC.  The Ledger is most valuable, fairest, the oldest.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:23:03
You swap your tokens for theirs then undue your payment.
Holy fuck it's not that complicated to come up with an i

inb4 the ETF is either a ponzi or gets hacked, then we all tell them they should have just bought the coins themselves.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:39:28
I'm not sure it will, the lower it gets the more attractive it is to normal joe's that can actually buy a whole BTC when they are looking at stuff to invest.

Minors can void contacts at will. 
So realistically nobody will work with a minor. 
The blockchain is math it doesn't know who you are. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:20:54
uhh no.
The depositor has to move his coins out of the orginal address before the 51% double spend is complete.  Otherwise the receiver can just broadcast the transaction and gain the coin anyways.
The depositor has to send a message to deposit, it get deposited.  Then they do the 51% attack to undue that deposit.  The first transaction is still signed in the mempool, broadcasted.  So they have to move the coins during the attack so nobody else can process the original broadcast afterwards.
It is very obviously done on purpose.  
They can show you never deposited coins into their account and you still owe them, thus they can sue you for what is owed.  They don't have to do anything about the attack, you were paid for the coins they are still waiting for so they sue you for them.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:15:43
Yeah the same as all of apple's factories, IPs, workers, and stores being stolen.  No difference there.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:21:33
That is a lie.
@_date: 2018-10-04 07:16:07
You think USD inflation is going to make loan interest go down?  
Are you retarded?
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:18:22
BTC is inflating.  It is not deflationary and it won't be until 2044ish
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:45:14
I just forked BTC 10million times, guess that is why it fell.
I don't think you understand what a fork is.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:43:47
People holding from $20k are definitely in capitulation right now.  Well people that bought in then.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:51:56
The GOP is in control and spending like crazy, we are heading towards a depression.
People are liquidating for some capital to buy stuff cheap later.
Check out these mortgage rates, 
These overpriced houses and cheap capital are not going to last in a 10% interest rate market.  Shit is going to get crazy.
Also goes to show you how bad the economy is for most people now.  Imagine buying your house at 18% interest.
You would need to be paying 30% of it's cost a year at minimum, ideally 50% of the house a year.  Our wages are shit compared to the 80's.

A tether clone, does not bode well for the future.
The tether and clones will collapse one day, it will be horrific.  A run on the banks like it's 1929.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:22:05
yep, just a meme, i'm sure nobody from 2013 made any money with the hodl
I mean BTC only went from $100 to $5k how can you make money off that strategy.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:26:19
Yep, the US government can't go bankrupt, they can just print away the problem, 10% inflation will evaporate the debt in a couple decades real easy.  We had 10-18% loan rates in the 80's we can have it again.
The US government owes all debt in USD per their own laws.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:42:59
Not on a single investment. 
But statistics don't lie, and on average it does.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:31:24
Please do, that would guarantee it going back to $10k instantly as some billionaire decides to pump in 100mil.

Do you live in a country where the banking infrastructure is the same as the majority of the people on the planet have access to?  If not you might not be interested.

This is how they got Gdax down from ~$13 to $0.01 for 8 minutes.  They got a bunch of stop losses to sell like crazy making a flash crash.  Then somebody bought 1000's for under a nickel each and a few minutes later it was back to $13.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:32:12


An unbelievably small amount right now.  BTC marketcap is at $78 billion.  Places like fidelity have a trillion dollars, a few of these guys offering crypto funds and getting 2% of their market into it would buy it out completely.  The price would skyrocket.
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:37:20
Hyperinflation, 10%+ a year inflation.
These countries will just print their debt away they won't default.
everybody holding fiat will lose, being owed debt in fiat same thing as holding it

A good way to see if the investment firm you use is working to stay ahead of the curve is to look at when they implement bitcoin.  If they are slow take your money elsewhere.  
It shows a lack of innovating and adapting to the market to be on the slow end of this, ultimately revealing problems in upper management and company;y decisions.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:23:53
That would be the people buying video cards last year.
BTC would be the equivalent of buying stocks in Ford and Chrysler etc.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:52:56
The USA cannot default on it's debt.  
It will just print money first.
