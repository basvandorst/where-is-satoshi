Cool. Ok, now on Cryptsy, I'm going to guess that this box, "Trade Key" is the remote address of my friend on Coinbase.  I guess it's just a language thing.
"Trade Key or Bitcoin Address"  makes it a bit 
clearer. Have no idea at first glance what a "Trade Key" is.
Wait, I'm totally wrong. dunand has the info.

Then he told Nakamoto he'd accepted an invitation to speak at the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters. "I hope that by talking directly to them and, more importantly, listening to their questions/concerns, they will think of Bitcoin the way I do - as a just-plain-better, more efficient, less-subject-to-political-whims money," he said. "Not as an all-powerful black-market tool that will be used by anarchists to overthrow the System."

Ok, from cryptsy, I needed to allow that address to be used, then reply to an email, and then an Auth Key thing.  Once that was all worked out, happened in a flash. But something Mom I'm sure could never figure out. Now I'm using MultiBit which seems ok, a bit crude on the GUI, but works.

I was peripheral to bitcoin until I heard Ted Cruz speak, and realize one crazy Canadian dude could shutdown and wreck the USA financial markets. At that point, I became a believer in bitcoin, and I guess the rest will be history.

Yes, murky. If you never go to fiat, no scanning is necessary, but once you go to paper dollars it is, or so I was told by an ATM maker. But I'm not even sure that is correct. Maybe someone can clarify that one?

A. Go to coinbase account. 
Click "Receive"
There is no address there, just an email box option.

It's easier to add a coinbase.com bitcoin payment option then PayPal. Think it's 99% certain PP/ebay will grab coinbase.com. They just have it all working.

Lots of numbers floating around, but the reality is, if all drugs are legal tomorrow, would you, me, friends, go out and try to kill themselves? You can do that with alcohol right now. It's pretty easy.

Generally Chase is one the more forward thinking banks. Just don't think the news is making it up the ladders there to the smarter people.

Portugal? They seem to have it worked out.


'This Is Working': Portugal, 12 Years after Decriminalizing Drugs
By Wiebke Hollersen
Twelve years ago, Portugal eliminated criminal penalties for drug users. Since then, those caught with small amounts of marijuana, cocaine or heroin go unindicted and possession is a misdemeanor on par with illegal parking. Experts are pleased with the results.

First time ever for me too. Coinbase broke on a recurring transaction. Looks like some software issues brewing there. I sent an email off yesterday, have heard nothing back from them. 
Not the way to run a company that handles money. What's happening there? I deal with Chase, they pick up that phone. 24/7. Love them or hate them, they respond, on the spot.
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:53:51
Yes, for the full text I was referring to Chase. Not coinbase, as a responsive entity.
As of today, they still have not responded. I'm ready to move on from Coinbase. 
Thought they were a cool, SF company, changing the planet. Looks like I was blinded by the hipster web site, and Kalifornia vibe.  
Suggestions for another vendor?

I can connect my JP Morgan Chase account to them. For now, can live with them. And they just got another $100M in funding. Backed by top West Coast VC firms. The creme of the creme of the top.
Think they are pretty solid. Well, getting there. Tech support has been dismal, but they are on a hiring blitz, so hopefully that also will improve.
And can move coins out anytime. No issues. But for sure looking for a back up or 2 to CB.

You could set up an automatic $10 a week buy.  Just one click on almost any exchange. 2 less Starbucks a week. Make coffee at home those days. 
I use coinbase.  I’d lose my key for sure, so I give up some authority to coinbase, at least I can move $$$ between Chase and coinbase with just a click.

So how out of touch is Jamie D is with the world?
Come to NYC and plunder, take back cash to the Pacific. NYC is SOOOOO old school at the top, would blow your mind how many out of date thinkers run these companies. "We make money the old-fashioned way. Why should we change?"
Not sure home much longer that kind of thinking will work.

Your friendly govt will print more money. No problem. They've been doing it that way for eons. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:12:05
When it gets too easy to make money, that’s when u may want to park some of your cash elsewhere.  The FANGS are steady but boring, so u make 50% in year? Boring, but steady.  
We are still in the early stages of a Bitcoin bubble, think lots more to go. But don’t expect a steady ride. Sorry to say there are people out here that are out for blood, they’re called traders. Most of them go by the name of C++.  They have no mercy.  
So diversify.   Just a tip. :-)
And do your yoga of course.  But I digress from the topic at hand.

I live and breathe the future. 
Dear Mr Dimone: 
CHASE, you are in BIG TROUBLE. But Citi is way worse off. 
These companies are being run by people just worried that they'll have a job next month, now they are trapped in $6500 Manhattan rents; so the innovation has stalled. NO ONE want to be the guy/gal that says:  Hey, lets think out of the box. NO ONE. The job risk is too high.
So they are gone. Well lets not say gone, but lets say, considerably less important. But the writing was there, oh so obvious. CHASE will be around forever, but do you want to work with a dinosaur of a bank or a hot startup? 
NYC/WALL Street is not moving past 1987. They can't. It's a mental thing. The Bay Area start ups are about to eat Wall Street banks for lunch, banking for the 22st century, get ready! :-)
plaid.com: WOW! Banking execs have NO idea these companies even exist. It's not in their world. They don't have to be. They have trillions of $$$s to watch over, but one day, they may be a bit surprised. Maybe they'll catch on, but have my doubts. But who knows?  They may go on a buying spree.
At Plaid, this is so awesome, submit your CV in JSON! Chase, I really doubt, really that they even know what a "JSON" thing is. It's just not in their world. Why should it be?




We give developers the tools to integrate with bank infrastructure. Access and authorize user bank accounts faster than ever before.

We're going to live on. It will take out less than 1% of the earths population. We will need a way to "barter."  Some form of currency, food of course is number 1, but after a period of a year or 2, we'll realize life is going on.
We'll adjust. Or Elon has taken us to mars already.  We'll be save there. Hopefully! :-)

This is NOT my idea, his explanation was detailed. Just don't have the damn link! Remember him being a serious academic at a university.
Global Warming over for sure. That was his main point.
The actually reduction in population would not be that tremendous. More like a statistical correction. 10% reduction in population still leaves BILLIONS of us still here.
Ocean pollution would drop to almost zero.
And for some reason, "income equality" would be a thing of the past. Not sure of how he figured that one out.
Of course you have that pesky radiation. In 30 years, things would be pretty close back to normal. 
Nature would rebound and fix all.
As above, not my idea, just thought it was an interesting "view point", crazy as it may seem.

I was in Stockholm. People seem pretty happy to me.
I was in Brooklyn. People seemed pretty happy to me.
I was in Central Park. Everyone was happy.
I was on Martha's Vineyard. On a nude beach. People were joyous.
I was in a dusty alley, down the path from another dusty alley, under a little walk way in Varanasi. 
People were super happy, and very stoned.
Just my life experience. :-)
TL;DR  Be Happy. It's all you got going for you. Don't worry so much. Someday it will all be over. Enjoy it while you can.

“We see this as part of the total sublation of the state,” said Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet’s director, who gained fame earlier this year when he published online the blueprints to a pistol that could be manufactured with a 3-D printer. “I know I sound like some kind of weird Jehovah’s Witness, but we’ve only just begun. We admit that we are ideologues.” 
What is the "canary in the cave", will be the first politician that tries to shut down coinbase.com.  That is your clue to who is evil, for that one person, be they Democrat, Republican, is the epic center of knowing, we are losing control of the people (who ever we are), and that is where the web of power lurks. For they see where control will crumble first. I don't think it will come from Wall Street. For these bitcoins meetups are packed with bankers. So I am so curious to see who says first: WE MUST SHUT THIS DOWN. And then follow the dots . . .

And Ok article, still a bit of sensationalism, "OMG, the Silk Road" . . . but rest of piece is worth a read.
Bitcoin gives file-sharing a brilliant twist. In essence, it has created “a decentralized virtual currency that uses a peer-to-peer consensus system to confirm and verify transactions,” two researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis concluded in a recent study. And François R. Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, made this assessment in a new report on bitcoin: “It represents a remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions (which could issue their own bitcoins) or even by governments themselves.”

The Times is not really run by a bunch of old white guys, there are a heck of a lot of cool people there. Believe it or not. They are so pro Marijuana (not pot, like in your kitchen), the articles you can smoke. David Carr? The guy is a legend. The old guys (and gals) are gone.  Really. But they have to give the other guys some column space, they just have too. If you don't read that paper, you are missing out on some amazing journalism. Like it or not.

Yes, I'm doing it purely for the academic experience. Think students would go wild with it. Really could turn them onto science here. My goal here is to visualize the mining process, in real time. 
Daily I'm talking to friends, students, store owners, no one knows what the heck a bitcoin is, so far. It's not even on their radar. Trying to change that.

Wow. Thanks. Looking at it now. I seem possessed by bitcoins, yet I own none. Guess just the idea of "be your own bank", fascinates me!
