You may want to check out [ShadowCash](  They have zero knowledge anonymity, and are launching a decentralized marketplace ShadowBay/S-bay within their official wallet.  Its in competition with OpenBazaar and will be out in the next couple months. Some more info: 
They also have encrypted messaging in their official wallet similar to bitmessage, and plan to implement voice, video, and file support soon.  They seem to have a very big team of hardworking devs.

So weird, you have the same exact decimals .00172674 as [this other person]( who just entered the 1 BTC club.  What a small world.
You may want to consider moving those coins off of a third party wallet service.  Remember if you don't hold your own private keys, then you don't own your bitcoin.  You only own a promise to pay bitcoin ;)

Plan is to hold and support an honest system rather than scam fiat systems.  There is no exit strategy.  Bitcoin is the exit from a failing system.  Also head has been above water for long time now.  Not all of us began investing in 2014.

Yeah its an uphill battle for sure when competing with Bitcoin's network effect.  But having one of the first decentralized marketplaces, along with a true anonymous coin that is also functional and user friendly will attract a fair amount of users in my opinion. This is enough to seed the market, and create the potential for something bigger.
