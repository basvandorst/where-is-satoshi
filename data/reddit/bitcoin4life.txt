The fastest way to get into mining is by buying one or more of these (shipped out within a day!): 
I love mine :)

Hmm, not sure about that move. Shares are currently 7% higher on btct which means I stand to lose quite a bit of money by moving my 60+ shares.

No problem - yeah, it must be customizable. I've made many a bitpay purchase and they've always run on 0 confirmations. Perhaps another merchant reading this can advise. I'd lean towards your e-commerce package perhaps not recognizing the bitpay payment success (thus, not completing the order within your system).
Happy to be the guinea pig :)

You likely won't find anything more affordable or that will arrive in your hands quicker than this: 
Sure there will be much better performing miners released in a month or two, but time is money. I was convinced to sell my GPU miners back in November because BFL was "just about to" take over the mining market with their new hardware - haha!
The auction listed above happened to be local to me so I was able to pick up a batch of ASICs SAME DAY and I'm already producing bitcoins - take that BFL!!! A lot of people laugh at these little miners but I'm confident that they'll pay for themselves and then some. BFL is likely still a long way out and I have my doubts that other manufacturers are about to "take over". There is still plenty of time for GPU/smaller ASICs to make money (wish I would have known that in November!).
I don't know what your goals are, but if you just want a damn ASIC in your hands ASAP to start minting coin, you can't beat it!

I just spoke with support. This will NOT be available on iOS. Apple refused to allow them to incorporate BTC payments in their app. They were so happy to be supporting bitcoin though. Copy/paste from support email: "Today has been crazy! But we are so excited"

Considering bidding. What's the opinion on bidding on these regarding the upcoming mining atmosphere? (i.e. will a bid of ~50BTC ever pay for itself?)
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:47:39
Someone asked them on Facebook but they have yet to reply. I think more people should be asking that question until they reply - it's pretty important at this point.
@_date: 2013-06-06 08:55:50
Ha! I was told the same thing about my GPUs in November and was advised by 100% of people I asked that keeping my GPU miners was a supid idea what with ASICs coming out any day. I forever regret that decision - could have made me very profitable had I thought for myself! Show me a single other ASIC that is shipping. Also, I believe the question was "Is anyone shipping?" ... so the answer was valid.

You have to click an acceptance form like this: 
When I clicked accept, that finely worded pop-up appeared, however.
Concerned it didn't take.

Just day-trading on all of the exchanges. I wouldn't call it arbitrage (tried that for a while, definitely NOT profitable considering the time involved). This hasn't been a problem on other exchanges (CampBX rocks!), but I just didn't realize how crippling Gox's verified account is for someone in my position (high volume trader).

Where's my damn invite!!!?? Looks cool.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:40:56
You are awesome! I was able to follow your instructions and purchase a gift card in under 15 minutes on my PC. Bonus - if you have the Blockchain app on iOS you can just snap a picture of the QR on your pc and instantly complete payment!
Thank you kind sir!

I cannot withdraw a single USD. I have a limit of $10k/day (up to $50k/month). My only option now is to either convert to BTC (losing money due to trading fee) or just sit and hope I eventually can get a trusted account :/
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:39:52
I own some G.ASICMINER-PT shares on bitfunder. How do I go about converting those to regular shares? Do I PM DeaDTerra on bitcointalk? Is there a minimum quantity? I had heard ~250 shares is the minimum they are willing to convert?
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:15:24
That's all I needed to hear - I will wait patiently. Is this a problem that just popped up today? Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:20:24
Awesome - that worked! Quick question though, isn't that the last sale value, not necessarily the current high bid? What would I need to change to show the current high bid? Also, would be nice to see how many coins are willing to be sold at that price, if possible.
**edit** - perhaps something like this?  echo $last["return"]["buy"]["display"];
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:35:15
Yeah - pain in the butt. I'm about to just buy a plane ticket to Japan :/
Again, this wouldn't be a problem if my funds were currently in BTC, but as it stands, they are in USD and come with silly transfer restrictions.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:17:06
If it were in BTC, this wouldn't be a problem :) My rate is well below 0.5% on Gox now, but even at that low rate, it would cost a pretty penny to convert my USD to BTC.
It's just silly restrictions on how many of MY OWN usd I'm allowed to transfer TO MYSELF. I really hope I can figure this out or my trading will have to come to an abrupt halt!

I was going to do a group buy, but didn't want to wait 1+ weeks for my precious little miners to arrive (due to rapidly increasing difficulty). I happened to find this local auction (and already picked some up!) on BitMit but even if you're not local, this guy is still probably the quickest seller (albeit for a slightly higher price): 
As the saying goes, time is money!
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:47:48
I did send him a PM but have not heard back. Will have to wait and see I guess.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:51:32
What is the hashrate of one of those units?? I can't seem to find any info other than where to bid!
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:52:40
I just placed an order and paid in bitcoin. While bitpay did confirm that payment was processed, I received no automated order acknowledgment from you guys and when I log into my account on your site, it says I haven't placed any orders. 
Also disturbing, the items are still appearing in my cart as if the order was never placed even though I DID pay.
I will shoot you an email with my bitpay receipt so you can look into this, but wanted you (and others) to know that the bitcoin solution may be a little quirky at present...

Thanks for your reply! I'm sorry, but I'm not very fluent in PHP - this is my PHP (api keys nul) and I'm not quite sure where I should insert that line that you're suggesting: 
Could you advise where it might go?
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:53:03
pm sent. The sky's the limit once trust is earned.
