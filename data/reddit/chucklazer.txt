I love oversimplified things.
If we stopped building war ships and guns for our military, what exactly do you think would happen. That everyone else would too? Unfortunately there are bad people on this planet and we need to defend ourselves or we will assimilate to whatever culture can will it's way onto your land.

Blah blah ya ya that's sweet and nice and all but you still didn't address the main point. What non-voilent crime deserves life in jail? That was the original question. He was simply making a point, not complaining. Because you're analogy is funny. *punishing me*? no, it doesn't affect at all.. he's just simply stating facts. And really, you're answer was just a waste of everyone's time because you're going on about some bullshit. Go fuck off. "Well unless that is you're prerogative heyucck heyuck.. where's my fedora?"
I bet u/rrtson was exactly that kid. Runs to his mom and tells on his older brother. He still has issues with it.
