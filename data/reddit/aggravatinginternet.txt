I'd just say they're wasting their energy talking. Then I throw my set out the lambo window and peel out.

If amazon starts accepting bitcoin I would let Bezos tattoo 'amazon prime' on my butt.

Can't you use an American exchange? 
Without knowing all the facts I'd be suspect of malware from a phone app.

This is just speaking for myself but I am big into personal liberty and I support bitcoin because of the potentiality to disrupt the ability of governments to suppress freedom. I support privacy and the idea that people should be free to choose how they live even if their decisions are unpopular. Like many, I came from a sort of libertarian background and thus 'mak[ing] money' is secondary to what I see as the potentiality of a better, freer future society.

There's a lot of opinions masquerading as facts in here.

That gave me an idea! If bitcoin gets a lot more popular people could run little businesses wherein they serve people like that. One party would come to a place of business and drop off the money, the other could come and pay the other party at the address they liked. It could all be anonymous, as much as that process could be, people would be able to get rid of their bitcoin, or buy it, without any oversight audit-able by the government after the fact.

Do you happen to know if that 3% fee is applicable if I run my bank card as debit? I've always done that with the thought that the merchant will save a bit of money on their end but never knew for certain whether I was correct or not in assuming that it would.

We all need to be steadfast and support solid ass coins like bitcoin and litecoin to weather this onslaught of 100,000 shitcoins that's coming at us.

He's not even 'funny stupid' like Krugman. I'll save other readers the time, these vids will make you worse off for having watched them. I am now perturbed.

Just wanted to say this post is amazing and you seem to have a knack for  tackling technical concepts in a way that lay people can understand.

I always wondered why Buterin was so damn skinny...

Did something come out about some new robbery or something? I've been wondering when criminals would catch on to bitcoin robberies being preferable to cash ones for a while now....

Is there any solid idea coming up for having people exchange cash for btc, or vice versa, anonymously? I don't even know how that could work but it would be awesome if so.

No.
