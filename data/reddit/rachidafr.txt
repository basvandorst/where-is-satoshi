True. Really awesome book.
@_date: 2019-07-06 06:54:51
Not really free of politics.
@_date: 2019-11-26 11:28:53
This shows once again all the interest of Bitcoin. Imagine the fees with the traditional financial system!
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:34:50
Best marketing campaign ever for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin will fix it!
@_date: 2019-11-27 05:36:24
You made me dream 10 seconds man!
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:35:12
One is even better than the other :)
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:46:38
Too bad :(

History repeats itself often and that is why it is essential to study past cycles in order to better predict future cycles.

Hard work stays the best way to become wealthy.

It is Bitcoin but also all the codes on GitHub.

Best Mom of the Year!
@_date: 2019-11-29 06:22:11
Bitcoin is the revolution.
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:50:10
Beautiful animation.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:29:44
Congratulations to your mother for participating in the rise of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:56:30
Bitcoin protects what you own.
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:22:21
Lightning Network is essential for the future of Bitcoin and its mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:57:23
Great marketing campaign for Bitcoin with a reverse psychological approach.
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:23:25
Kraken is one of the best exchanges.
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:26:59
Great article.
Block after block, Bitcoin continues to build a better and fairer system for everyone.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:11:15
Thanks Jimmy Song.
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:22:16
Really amazing news for Lightning Network adoption on Bitcoin Blockchain.
@_date: 2019-12-31 10:11:09
Hearing these people criticize Bitcoin with false arguments should open their eyes to many people.
These people are afraid of the fairer system that Bitcoin built block after block.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:27:17
Bitcoin is the next big thing for sure.
@_date: 2019-12-31 11:28:39
Symbol of wealth.
If you can afford a Lambo, you have to be extremely wealthy.

The current price of bitcoin does not matter.
Bitcoin is here to stay and it's a solution for the future.
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:05:30
Impossible to predict with a specific date.
I think that Bitcoin will see its price reach $100,000 in the future but I can not say if it will be in 5, 10 or 20 years.
@_date: 2019-12-03 18:06:44
I had never really asked myself the question, I thought it was purely arbitrary.
I am amazed by all the comments on the possible meaning that Satoshi Nakamoto would have given to this limit of the number of BTCs that could be mined.
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:57:17
Whose fault is it ? To the governments of western countries mainly.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:36:45
What coherent person would leave such a quantity of Bitcoins on an exchange?
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:07:30
Obama did not say Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:21:39
Fun :)
@_date: 2019-12-08 20:27:56
Proof of keys is coming. We will see which are the best exchanges.
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:25:26
Bitcoin is far better Western Union.
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:11:07
The mere fact of appointing Lagarde to this position shows that the political system is totally flawed.
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:39:33
Funny illustration.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:12:13
See Bloomberg improvise cryptocurrency expert makes a good laugh.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:42:51
So true.
Time to buy and to accumulate more Bitcoins.
Those who sell now are jerks.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:42:13
They will be able to wait a long time.
Bitcoin will bury them.
@_date: 2019-12-26 08:21:18
Because of its dominant position, Google has too much power with YouTube.
The company can afford to censor dozens of YouTubers without any justification whatsoever.
There is no respect on their part and unfortunately, there is nothing we can do because of their power.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:10:51
Be patient and resilient!
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:30:03
Is HODLING Bitcoins considered as passive or active?
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:36:06
The most disturbing thing is that Google has still not communicated on the subject in order to give justifications for these bans.
@_date: 2019-12-08 20:41:16
Thanks for this great answer!
@_date: 2019-12-23 09:26:17
What is the point of posting an article dating from 2009?
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:26:59
For many people in the world, Bitcoin = Blockchain.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:43:36
It's the perfect time to accumulate.
It's Santa Claus who comes before time :)
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:52:49
Bitcoin best investment of the upcoming decade.
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:44:47
Bitcoin allows you to transfer very quickly, at low fees large volumes without the need to answer questions (as banks do) or risk of blocking.
Your money really belongs to you with Bitcoin.
