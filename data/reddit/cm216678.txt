I understand exactly what you mean. But if your current exchange was Coinbase for arguments sake, what would entice you to move?

Yeah, agreed on both counts. But until its shut down, I'll run with them.
bankmecu were the most blunt with their response - almost rude. BOQ were similar (not rude) stating its too volatile. Not sure how the volatility affects them. Ill-informed, knee jerk reactions I suspect.
ANZ surprisingly asked to arrange a meeting to discuss and open the account. Not holding my breathe on that one.

Thanks all. Yes ASIC listed Pty. Ltd. ABN/ACN, etc.
Just had a call from BankWest who were more than helpful offering me a business account.
I was very frank and open about the business, the transfers and my AML/KYC policies and she assured me that they were happy to assit.
+1 BankWest!
(interestingly a subsidiary of Commonwealth Bank!)

Thanks for you comments. Based on the likely regulatory requirements for AML and KYC policies, I would imagine that 100% proof of identity will be mandatory in any legitimate exchange. Thoughts?

You mean on deposits and withdrawals I assume?

Yes, I thought they may have been a little more progressive - especially being "the peoples bank". They were very blunt and dismissive, almost rude. Not sure of their motivation, fear of the unknown I guess.

My whole strategy is honesty, security, trust and support. Based on these values, I don't want to have a core part of the success of my business built on deceit. I realise it will be a bumpy road (as with most disruptive tech) so its par for the course.

And we wonder why we're having difficulty achieving a large scale adoption for bitcoin. For the average punter, this is quite complex/"too hard basket"...

This may be the best written ELI5 for hashing yet. Great work!

Yeah, that sub too!
