This is the first thing I tell people that I know getting into bitcoin. Doesn't matter what you have, someone else will want to take it. Easiest way to lose bitcoin is letting someone get access to the device you use to manage them. Once they have it, you're beat. Even if you know which of the 50 people you told you have 10 bitcoins in savings was able to get access to your devices, what are you going to do? Do you think they will keep it? It will be gone within hours filtered through a number of different wallets. Good luck proving they own that wallet you traced it to.

[Bitcointalk Thread](
[Last posts by the creator Jine and an explanation as to what happened](
[Reddit post for Bitlc.net](
[Twitter for Jine](
So further reading, everybody is labeling Jine as a scammer and saying him and this Erik, which I can't find a last name for, ran off with whatever coins were left in the pool's wallet.

Could have been better, I would have made a folder with the password.txt executable and used the shortcut to point to it. I would instinctively open the password.txt and ignore the shortcut file. If it was just a shortcut file, I'd still be suspicious but might go for it.

When MtGox was hacked all usernames and e-mails associated were leaked out and are still out there. [This post]( says that it was from that list. Can confirm my e-mail used then also received one of these e-mails.

That's awesome. Love their equipment, too. Even got one for my Mom a year or 2 ago.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:31:16
Appreciate it, thanks.

hmmmm custom laptops for BTC? Ok, interesting. [Sager\Clevo]( laptops for BTC? Fucking sold.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:18:54
2nd this, want to dig into this too. Already taken off the server.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:10:44
This. Seized when FBI\FinCEN seized MtGox's Dwolla account. IMO, they just want to ignore anything dealing with this and continue business as normal. I've tried to have my withdraw pushed through but they never got to it after 8 months. Just asked them to cancel, sold for BTC and sold on CampBX.

No no no, thats not how it works. It has a set amount of caffeine. But, as you hodl, that caffeine will have a larger affect on you when you are ready.

Don't forget to put a wallet.dat file on them
@_date: 2016-11-10 15:40:33
is now deleted so just assume this was a NSA ploy to tie bitcoin addresses to reddit usernames.

That is actually a good point. We not even close where we need to be for large storage drives with high IOPS.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:55:01
10tb drives are becoming mainstream now, what do you think is going to happen in 4 years? Do you think we will still be limited to cheap 4tb drives? No HDD storage is going to increase exponentially just as the blockchain will.

Have had a WellsFargo account strictly for bitcoin for a few years. I've used MtGox, TradeHill and CampBX. No issues so far.

Singles are much different than Jalapenos. I got my 2 Jalapeno's on June 13th. I believe my order number was 4419. Paid on Aug 8th 2012.

Screw it, [just sent .1]( Hopefully he makes use of it.

Withdraws do not go through immediately. I withdrew 13btc on 11-26. [Here]( is the blockchain transaction showing it didn't actually go through until 11-28.
Edit: If you didn't know, you can check the address this was withdrew to in your account history, it will show where it went and if you look that address up on blockchain you can see if someone initiated the transfer from MtGox's side yet.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:06:28
I think you can e-mail them and ask for an increase once verified. I'm at $5k a day which might be the highest but not sure. Got verified last year.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:46:57
Some sites won't even let you login without the code. CampBX is one of them. There is nothing there to re-verify or add to another device without logging in. Would likely have to open a support ticket or something and wait for a response. 
With MtGox you can choose what you want to require 2FA. I don't have mine enabled for login but only for security changes and withdraws. MtGox doesn't give me the key or the option to add to another device. Back when I first enabled it, I never backed up the QR Code or anything so I couldn't move it to another device only disable and add a new one. I wound up eventually rooting and grabbing the key and adding to another device.

I've had litecoin on my Bitcoin system for ages. Used to Mine LTC when it was easier. I wonder if something new is being downloaded along with the client. Worried about my BTC at home, guess I'll find out if I have anything left later.

I've opened an account with Wells Fargo specifically for bitcoin dealings so if anything happened when I was first withdrawing money, my main savings account would be separate. Person I was talking to when opening had no clue what it was at the time(2011). I've had $60k + go through my account and no issues. Have kept withdraws low to not arouse too much suspicion. With the all time highs recently, I've been selling what I have left, transferring 15k in at a time. Spoke with someone at my local branch and bitcoin has been a hot topic there and they seem to have no issues so far. Seems their stance is as long as I'm bringing money in, they'll be happy to take it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:04:18
This. Plus you get Gyft points back which you can then use for additional cards.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:16:02
Just wait until they buy bitcoins, then when it comes time to pay him the price rises and they won't need to use as many, saving money for the city. Will catch on quick.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:20:07
If you really wanted to go this route, you could always contact Gyft directly and see if they can work with dell to get something setup. Does look like you can already do this through egifter, with a max of $500 per card.

Keeping the spirit
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:49:44
This is not the first time I've heard this happen from MtGox, even with 2FA enabled. I can't say for sure if it is the exchange but I've hat 16k sitting in mtgox since june, and I've had much more in my account and nothing has ever happened to my account.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:20:14
How did you pay a %5 fee? I have about 15k stuck in gox and 4k of it has been processing since June 16th.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:53:29
Of course it could happen. Hopefully good things happen with India and continues to happen with China.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:08:59


Me too. Please, let us know if you ever find anything.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:45:09
Saw someone do .25 shortly after I sent mine. He's almost up to .7 BTC now.
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:13:08
... Was that really a $530 tip? wat
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:46:22
If it shows it's been sent already there is no way to reverse it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:27:18
Awesome. Time to cash out more BTC to Gyft. Amazon Christmas shopping time!
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:47:04
Send all to a BTC exchange. Withdraw coins slowly, maybe to multiple addresses, no need to even sell. Nobody would ever know where they went.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:26:43
No, check account history when you are logged into MtGox. It shows every transaction that your account has ever had and it will list the withdrawing address there.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:49:13
Yep, ~$300 for jalapenos which I received in June. Made close to 10BTC since. Cashed out most as Gyft cards.
@_date: 2013-08-22 16:38:53
As someone who had 2 units delivered, one has already failed. At least I've made back what I spent, almost 8 BTC already.
