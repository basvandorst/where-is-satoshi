Let them all stay poor and stupid.  It's all they are capable of.

There is inherent value and utility with Bitcoin, as a store of value.  But it's not a good medium of exchange right now and plenty of altcoins do that much better.....also smart contracts, privacy, etc.  Bitcoin has fallen behind and making no indication is plans to catch up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:40:59


We will agree to disagree.  The US gov't does not back the value (purchasing power) of their currency.
The gov't certainly engages in activities that contribute to the dollar having value, but it doesn't guarantee the value as they did when it was backed by gold reserves.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:12:49
I never suggested that it did.  You are trying too hard.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:39:02


And the technology behind Bitcoin is what makes it a better store of value than other alternatives like gold coins or comic books or whatever.   And "better" is a matter of opinion, but for many people it is.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:56:55
And they use absolutely none of that to back the value of their currency.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:21:31
doesn't matter because fees are too high to spend Bitcoin anyway.   But people don't spend their dollars because of 2% inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:28:46
Ok you are one of those people who won't even say "Ethereum".  I'm bored.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:03:53


The Venezuela one and also the one in India that lost 100% when the gov't arbitrarily said it was suddenly worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:07:13


Only problem is that you can't buy hardly anything with Bitcoin and the gov't and banks control you converting to fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:58:47


Yes, of course.  I would say it's 50/50.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:19:20


Ok we can agree to disagree about that.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:21:40
I wasn't aware of that, but I see what you are saying.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:06:03
Bitcoin is highly regulated and will be even more strictly regulated in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:05:13


No they didn't.  The price didn't drop from his comments.  It was a non-factor.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:13:26


Yes, it's called conventional use of the English language.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:02:42
Yes people are so delusional they don't even know they are slinging bullshit.  It was designed as a currency and promoted as a currency and only when it failed as a currency do the proponents start saying it doesn't need to be one.
But the market doesn't stay delusional forever and Bitcoin's value with drop even more if it's not really useful.

Not much of the world left once China, India, Russia, EU, and USA has it banned.

He didn't just start building his portfolio yesterday.  He's old and those were probably good options in the 1950s.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:50:19


No, they forked off primarily to have a larger block slize.


Bitcoin can't continue improving without forking, which is what I said.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:42:46
Good points.  And he is about as part of the "Establishment" as you can get.  Anything that challenges the status quo and the Big Banks is a threat to him, either directly or indirectly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:03:25
Dude deserves it and just shows that there are some Bitcoiners out there with sick money (and big hearts).
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:42:54
Agreed about EFF.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:14:26
This is actually pretty good, and entertaining.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:16:37
It is a fork off of Bitcoin core.  So you are perhaps suggesting that Bitcoin core should never fork at all and should remain in its current technological state forever, with no improvements, no changes.  Because when it does, it won't be Bitcoin any longer.  Many disagree.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:42:50
Yes China is out of the game and India has been for awhile.  Of course people will say they don't care, but they will care when the EU and USA follows...and they likely will, before long.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:38:37


No that argument assumes positive change and growth, through forks, or "amendments" in your example.  You are just making an analogy that agrees with me.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:58:28
They are charging those people with facilitating terrorism, just because they mine cryptocurrency.   That's how they justify it and of course it's an attack on individual rights.  The USA and EU and China and South Korea and India and Russia, etc have all attacked individual rights when it comes to crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:59:38
Yes exactly.  If it doesn't slow down soon, EU and USA will crush it.  I will get crushed in there too, but just saying, that is what is likely to happen.
And most everyone in the USA and EU won't care.  1/2 of them will believe whatever "terrorist" propaganda is shoveled down their throat along with all the other sh*t that they eat with a smile.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:39:12
It was pretty much inevitable and the higher the BTC price goes, the more adoption there will be and the more gov'ts will crack down on crypto.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:40:22
That would be them reporting something is factually incorrect, just to further your agenda.  Yes, they did successfully steal your brand and the market has decided it was a successful theft.  More forks will try this and most will not be successful.
So good luck with the guerrilla tactics, but probably won't work if the market decides otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:14:54
They claim it is Bitcoin, because they claim it is more accurately represents the attributes and goals laid out in Satoshi's whitepaper.  And they do have some valid points.    
Which is truly Ethereum?  Ethereum or Ethereum Classic?  Both sides have valid arguments there.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:09:10


F****ing greedy elitists who only care about price appreciation, and who invite more government regulation.  It's much different than Bitcoin's more noble and ethical roots.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:33:34
It has always been the biggest threat to Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.  I've said that for the last four years.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:49:22
If Satoshi's vision was $100 miner fees to transfer some funds,  then Fuck Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:06:20
He has been paid in BTC for years, so I'm sure he was already super wealthy.   He still deserves this and much more though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:57:24
I don't know. I'm not a mind reader like you. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:37
The conversation is above and speaks for itself.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:41:30
Yeah I have FB friends posting about it now.  Bitcoin and crypto have definitely turned a corner and the mass adoption stage has begun, unless the more goverenments shut it down like China and India already have.  And those are only the two largest countries on the planet, by far, so it's no big deal.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:47:44
Don't you think that paying $10 fee to send $100 payment is real world value use?
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:04:16
But most people have a use for traditional banks, yet they were too lazy/dumb to get in on the crypto revolution.  So therefore Bitcoin is evil.
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:03:19


Because there are plenty of dumb motherfuckers out there who believe every word.  It is a War and there are no rules in love and war.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:39:28
I agree with you there and Monero is my favorite coin.  And you sound like you are a woman...you must be very intelligent, because most women are not into crypto and are confused and bored by it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:39:57
Yes Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash do protect privacy to a large degree vs other electronic payment options.  They aren't 100% effective in 100% of cases....neither is cash.  Monero is obviously even better.
