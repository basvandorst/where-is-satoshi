I'll just put in my two bitcoins. Congress believes that the only real use for it as a currency is for illicit financial activity, like buying drugs, money laundering, and funding terror for example. As a digital precious metal, it's not really useful except as a speculative instrument that has no floor, where value investors see it as a bargain. Value investors see no value in it, not because they don't understand the technology, but because there's nothing inherently tying the useful technology to bitcoin. That's why they say it's a bubble by definition. So, these Congress-folks have been briefed on bitcoin by mainly expert investors, who have explained to them that the only true value of bitcoin as a currency (as opposed to being a speculative bubble where there's always a dumber buyer) is for illegal activity. That's something legislators can't ignore, but it's also very tricky to get the wording right. These things will go through several phases of amendments and be interpreted in every way possible before it ever comes to the floor for a vote.

You're correct that this is why most people buy stocks. But, Buffet and a whole slew of value investors analyze all the valuation metrics of a company, brand strength, and crucially, calculate a margin of safety for each stock. This is the biggest difference. You will never have margin of safety with a speculative asset like bitcoin.

Price watchers - Do yourselves a favor and end this fantasy. You're doing exactly the opposite of what every successful investing professional has taught throughout history. There must be a part of you that realizes you're not investing, but gambling. And watching the price means, basically, you're hoping there are people in this world more careless with their money than you. If you're not ready to lose your entire gamble on bitcoin, or some 90% of it, don't buy it. There is no "dip" or "peak" with it, only collective irrationality, price manipulation, or last- sucker-out fire sales. If you want to invest, learn how to value an actual revenue-producing asset like a stock, bond, commodity, real estate, natural resource, etc...  You've been dumb up til now. Time to get smart.

@_date: 2018-05-18 16:10:05
Saving is not the same as hoarding. Also, I'm sure there are countless thing you would purchase right now if you had the money. The point I'm making is, say you have 20 bitcoin worth a total of $164,000 USD. If you know it will be worth more in the future, why would you spend any of it? Now, if that's the only "currency" you have, you would be forced to spend it on necessities like food, water, electricity, shelter..., but with everyday purchases you would be severely disincentivized to ever spend. Guess what happens to 75% of the jobs in the United States in this scenario. They disappear. So, despite these forces you're talking about, there are logical economic conclusions you can make if it ever actually becomes widely used. And these conclusions suggest it is impossible that it will ever be widely used as a currency unless it becomes an INFLATIONARY asset, which incentivizes spending and creates jobs and growth. In that situation, why not just use fiat?

 Value investing is one of the most complex things in the world. There is so much to learn and it is constantly in flux. It takes serious intelligence to do right and profit.

It's just incredibly risky.

Ah... thanks for the article. Although, the author is using his current bank holdings (most of which he bought at bargain prices AFTER the crises started) to argue that he profited off of government bailouts. This is not accurate. Buffet himself actually bailed out Goldman and aided the bank bailouts by investing in them when everyone else was selling. This is why he's so rich. Finally, you have yi understand the nature of the bailouts. They were loans to the banks that were paid back in full. I'm not defending it, or saying it was right.
But now, if bitcoin is reliant on the banking system collapsing. Isn't this bit of history a mighty lesson that it probably won't ever collapse?

 I see. There is a sliding scale to risk in his mind. Tech stocks with incredibly high multiples like Amazon and Netflix don't make sense because 10-20x growth is already priced into the stock. That's very risky. With Crypto, it's impossible to value properly because it has no earnings. So, while the risk of Netflix or Tesla is high down the scale..., any crypto currency is much, much further down the risk scale. It's not the same at all.

I have to disagree, but you make a good point about the elites. Gold was a terrible currency. To help combat the Great Depression, faced with mounting unemployment and spiraling deflation in the early 1930s, the U.S. government could do almost nothing to stimulate the economy. To deter people from cashing in deposits and depleting the gold supply, the U.S. and other governments had to keep interest rates high, but that made it too expensive for people and businesses to borrow. So in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cut the dollar’s ties with gold, allowing the government to pump money into the economy and lower interest rates. Most economists now agree 90 percent of the reason why the U.S. got out of the Great Depression was the break with gold. And the guess who had all the gold when this happened. The elites. So, you say the elites are massively benefited by fiat. Well, it was much worse when they were hoarding gold. At least with fiat, the elites have to deploy it through investing or spending to combat inflation.

@_date: 2018-05-18 13:23:09
 Fantastic. You've learned what speculative prices are all about.  And, now you've become one of the true believers who buy it at any price because now it's about bitcoin's eventual adoption. However, there are some deep logical flaws here. 1. HODLing has a different term...., hoarding. I know you're all trying to stabilize the price or boost it or whatever. But, the hoarding nature is detrimental to its widespread adoption. You want it adopted? Then collectively you would use every single bitcoin you buy and spend IT as a currency. But that's not what's happening. 2. There is a reason why HODLers are hoarding it. It's a deflationary asset. Deflationary assets, if ever used as a currency, eventually fail as a currency due to...  guess what... widespread hoarding. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:24:58
One thing Munger and Buffet hammer home is to ask the question "What if I'm wrong?" before committing to an investment. You, being a bitcoin speculator, cannot ask that question, because if you did, you wouldn't gamble on this irrational belief of yours. You actually believe that every company that doesn't adopt bitcoin will fail. You actually believe that bitcoin will "revolutionize" capitalism. But you have exactly zero rationale for bitcoin's current price and future price. I'll do it for you. If you're wrong, which in my opinion you are terribly, you lose everything you gambled (It's not investing) and your worldview only gets more pessimistic. Now that's funny!

I love terms like "revolutionize" and "disruption," especially in an article that makes absolutely no mention of Bitcoin's usage as a currency. I've followed this train for a while now. It has morphed from "Lambo time ��" to "buy, you brave souls ��," to "I just used bitcoin as a currency, YAY," and now to straight up accumulation, buying the dip, and HODLing (hoarding). This is what happens with deflationary assets. They get hoarded and never get used. I actually thought it would take far longer for this to happen to Bitcoin. Either start using your bitcoin as a currency, or contribute to the problem by hoarding and accumulating. These wall street douchebags are coming in to keep the speculation and volatility going so they can rob grandma's piggy bank.

Sorry bud. This is fantasy thinking. Who's gonna force companies to innovate..., and what do you mean by "truly good products?" Time and time again, deflation results in hoarding.

Actually, Buffet is right about this with respect to the current state of bitcoin. And you're not wrong about what happens if it ever gets adopted on a massive scale. The price will converge to something and the limited supply will make it a deflationary currency. However, you should understand two main points. 1. Nobody has any idea what the actual convergence price of BTC is. It could be $8k, $1k, $1 million, or $20 bucks. 2. If it does get adopted, its deflationary nature will cause people to hoarde it as opposed to spending it. So, this either will prevent it from ever being widely adopted (probably why it is being speculated on so much, or HODL'd by so many), or cause it to fail as a currency.

I'm so tired of this willful ignorance of monetary policy. The Fed "prints" money in an economic recovery. This is not a tax and it's not taxpayer money. When inflation gets to unhealthy levels, say, above 3%, the Fed "burns" money to control it.  You don't call this an anti-tax. Why is low, but non-zero inflation healthy for an economy? To prevent cash hoarding, which is what happens with deflationary currency, and to promote spending/investing, which is what creates jobs and increases overall wealth. You don't believe this? Well, then ask yourself, why the fuck are Bitcoiners so fucking obsessed with Hodling and accumulation? There is another word for this. Hoarding. It's the natural result of a deflationary currency. And this is the reason why widespread adoption is a fool's dream. Time to stop being stupid.

Historically, gold has a horrible rate of return, but it's less speculative than cryptocurrency. Now, when you say cryptocurrencies, I'm assuming you mean the ones that aren't outright scams, which apparently is limited to only a handful. And of those, like bitcoin, that aren't scams..., the volatility and potential downside is far too great to expect it to be a good store of value.

It does make sense to save some emergency dollars of you need liquidity. But, i agree it's not good to just hold cash. Bitcoin is very risky to store your money because it's so volatile and literally could collapse at any minute.  There are no underlying earnings that can act as a floor for its price, so it's impossible to value properly. Gold is far more stable as a value store, and actually does have baseline value. A blend of foreign and domestic stocks, bonds, REITs, and natural resource ETFs is the best way to grow your money.

 If you're going to do this, hold for at least a year before spending, unless you're going to realize a loss and use it as a tax write off. Normally, holding for at least a year will make you liable for 15% of the gains in taxes. The short term rate is much higher, if you earn a normal income. That said, converting dollars to bitcoin to make purchases also involves converting back to dollars. This will not change any time soon, so stop fooling yourself into believing that you're actually using bitcoin as a currency. You're not. This practice is equivalent to buying Apple stock and then selling Apple stock to buy pizza..., as absurd as that sounds.

Do you understand rate of return? If it can only purchase 350 loaves of bread, and that is constant, then it has zero return.

I'm talking about investments..., stocks, bonds, property, REITs, natural resources, foreign markets. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:57:19
 your best argument is that there is a very unlikely scenario where the U.S. government fails to meet its debt obligations, which will cause a default on its bonds. This would result in runaway inflation and a "bank run" (look it up), which will result in another great depression. Crypto has limited supply, which theoretically will allow it to hold value, like gold, through these credit crunch events. But, whether it would actually hold its value is only speculative since it's a highly volatile and speculative asset and does not have a commonly established value, unlike gold. So, it's a pure gamble as to whether it would actually be better than bank holdings in the very unlikely event that the U.S. actually defaults on its debt obligations. In other words, your premise is most likely wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:52:40
 It's not a research paper. It's common sense. 1. You buy bitcoin with taxed dollars. 2. You pay a capital gains tax when you use bitcoin for a transaction. 3. You pay sales tax for whatever you buy. It's the same as with buying stocks and selling them to make a purchase. But stocks are not pretending to be a currency.

Bitcoiners, time to stop fooling yourselves. Even if the premise that "purchasing power" of the dollar has dropped was true, you're belief that bitcoin will solve this is totally flawed. We could have always used gold as currency, and we could always switch back to gold. But we don't..., not because of some hairbrained big banker, fiat is evil, wall street, government conspiracy..., but because controlled, moderate inflation is the single most effective tool in making an entire planet wealthier. This is counterintuitive and probably makes no sense. If so, go learn more about economics, crises, and the world in general. 
Furthermore, purchasing power has not fallen at all. It has grown significantly. You have to factor in wage increases and consumer prices to get to actual purchasing power. Unless you're just focusing on non-inflation adjusted dollars, which is fucking moronic. Whoever wants a world where you can stash away cash that does not devalue is totally ignorant when it comes to finance. The answer is right there. What if everyone did it? You'd get a deflationary spiral and stone age depression. Full adoption of bitcoin as a currency would result in the same thing. Stop fooling yourselves. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:39:40
That makes no sense. The dollar is not a speculative instrument. It's a stable currency that steadily devalues over time in order to maintain economic growth. You are disincentivized to hold dollars in your mattress, and incentivized to put them back into the economy. That's how real currencies work. Bitcoin will never work that way. Get it?
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:20:44
 Your bank is making 20+% on your credit card.  Those 3 bitcoins need to make at least a 20% return for you to break even. 20% annual returns are very rare for any investment. If you're not trolling, you're fucked.

Yes, they are two different taxes, unfortunately. You pay a sales tax on the good based on a local tax rate (unless you live in New Hampshire, Oregon, and a few other non-sales tax states). You have to also pay a capital gains tax on the $6, which is typically based on your normal income tax rate. Capital gains in bitcoin is taxed just like any investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:17:20
You are totally ignorant. Your points make no sense. And you don't understand that... so, unfortunately, you can't be helped! It's very unfortunate, but not many people care. I actually do care, but you're so fucking done over, that you are unable to learn. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:12:15
You're right, but I'm arguing against doing it with Bitcoin. Also, I'd argue against doing it with individual stocks. If you're going to DCA, it's best to do it with underlying indices, a roboadvisor (which spread across ETFs), or a 401k about (which typically invest in a blend of ETFs). Congrats on killing it with Netflix. That is one hell of a stock. I've got a similar story with a few tech stocks like Nvidia and Google. Good hunting. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:35:02
So there are some fundamentals of investing that you totally miss/ignore when making that very risky assessment that bitcoin is better than the traditional vehicles. One is margin of safety. Bitcoin has none, so there is no room for error in your valuation of its price. That means you're subjecting yourself to insanely high risk based on this belief in bitcoin. Another is intrinsic value. Again, bitcoin has none other than the concept that it's limited, which can be said for thousands of other digital tokens. You're making a gamble because there are no earnings behind bitcoin to gauge its value. So, just understand that you're not "investing" in bitcoin. You're speculating/gambling. And don't say you weren't warned.

@_date: 2018-03-23 04:52:52
 If your bitcoin, before using as a currency, had gained in value since you bought it, then you're liable for the capital gains when you use it as a currency (which, under U.S. tax law, is the same as selling it). It's the same with buying and selling any stock that gains in value. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:34:46
 Hold cash. Resist your basic human instinct to buy high and sell low. You learned a lesson. Now, learn the fundamentals of value investing. Read "intelligent investor" by Benjamin Graham and maybe "a random walk down wall street" by Burton Malkiel. Or just passively invest in a robo advisor like wealthfront and call it good. You're coming in at a bad time, but you can profit from pessimism of you're smart and patient. Avoid crypto bullshit, and you'll do fine. Get in it for the long term and diversify to minimize risk. Robos do that inherently. Get in the right mindset, and in 10 years you'll be wealthy and laugh at the poor bastards looking for speculative schemes like bitcoin. Do it right.

 I'm not sure I follow. Each time you sell (or use bitcoin to buy something) in the U.S., you pay capital gains (long term or short term depending on how long you've held it). The repurchase does not affect that tax implication. Even if you sell bitcoin and immediately buy bitcoin for the same amount, you are liable for the capital gains. It's the same with stocks. If you sell Apple stock and buy the same amount of Apple stock, you shoot yourself in the foot.

 Bitcoin is a product... oh, I get it now. A "product" is defined as anything offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need. In this case the want or need is getting rich.  Just like every scam in history. If not that, then the illusory hope that when the world collapses and all fiat inflates to nothing, bitcoin and the blockchain will be left on computing devices running on faith in bitcoin alone, and people will use these ideas of currency as actual money to barter for their needs. I can't wait until the day when I can tell a breadmaker that I own bitcoins and try to convince him to take them for some bread. We can record the transaction on a physical ledger that will be like a blockchain, because I'll tell my buddies and he'll tell his buddies, who will tell everyone they know that the transaction took place, so there's no fucking denying it. That's why I'm hodling and constantly buying the dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:45:31
I think you're confused. Demand for digital currency can fluctuate wildly. So you're hanging your certainty on the supply alone without any certainty regarding demand. The demand is purely speculative, meaning the only reason there is demand is that people like you believe the price will keep going up. But once the steam runs out on the speculation side, demand plummets. Price plummets. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:08:04
This is too funny. Six articles come out today about bitcoin's demise, the coming tax horrors for those not claiming their gains, and its infeasability as a currency.

 I think you miss the point. If you're buying bitcoin with USD in order to use it AS A CURRENCY (isn't that the whole point of this enthusiasm on this sub?), you get hit hard on taxes. Yes, if you INVEST in it, it's just like a normal speculative gamble on its price, like betting black on the roulette wheel. If you gamble on it for the purpose of using it as a currency, then you've baked in a lot of risk and the added punishment of capital gains+sales tax. Mentally, I've found it very valuable to split dollars up into investment versus currency. You put them in 401k or Roth, and you don't take the initial income tax hit... that's 30-35% more dollars earning for you and compounding. If you compare that to buying bitcoin, you've already taken a 30-35% hit that you'll need to make up.

Chartists are wrong half the time. Bitcoin price movements cannot be analogized with stock price movements. The psychology is different and the valuation floor based on fundamentals doesn't exist.

That's not something I'd hang my hat on. Time for the final drive down. Have fun fellas.

You lose out on gains as an investor in the currency. Say you buy 1 bitcoin at $7,000, sell at $9,000, and immediately buy at $9,000. The $2,000 in profit is taxable at 40%. So, you lock in only $1,200 in profit versus just keeping it. Hold for at least a year and pay less taxes.

 So, are you investing in blockchain? Bitcoin's future use as a currency? Or its speculative growth in price. In any case, it's a horrible investment because it is impossible to accurately price. So anyone claiming that they're "investing" in bitcoin clearly doesn't understand the difference between investing and speculation. Nothing inherently tires bitcoin to blockchain (i.e., blockchain can be used without Bitcoin), so putting money in bitcoin to invest in blockchain is dumb. Believing that its future utility as a currency justifies its current or future valuation is equally silly. If everyone does that, it will never actually be adopted as a currency since it'll always be a speculative "asset," like gold. So please be clear that you do not "invest" in bitcoin. You speculate on it. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:59:22
 No, you're confusing the scenario. If you use a bitcoin and then immediately buy another one to "replace" it, you pay a tax on the capital gains of the bitcoin you used. The fact that you get to select which one you use (if this is even possible, and if it is, good luck keeping track), doesn't avoid the fact that you still pay tax on the capital gains.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:51:22
 It's the perfect scam. Make it complex enough so that smart people who don't understand investing believe that because something is complicated and most people don't understand it, it must be a good investment.

But really what has happened is a collective bandwagon fallacy of naive people who think they are smarter than everyone else actually believing that bitcoin is going to replace real currencies..., and that somehow by buying them you're supporting a game changing cause.

 No need to bear with you. You and I have a fundamental disagreement, and I believe you're completely wrong and naive. You think fiat is a scam, well history is not on your side. You think I've been brainwashed, but I'm merely participating in the economy whereas you're expressing fringe views that most would consider ridiculous and frankly silly. Stocks have yielded on average 7-8% returns since pretty much the founding of this country. We've gone through recessions, depressions, crashes, and still it rises steadily. You're wrong about why people invest in gold too. They invest to speculate on its value. That's why gold rises during recessions and decreases during boom years. It has a horrible average return though. And no one accepts it as currency. 
My wealth is in a blend of stocks, bonds, natural resources, REITs, foreign developed and emerging market stocks, municipal bonds, yieldcos, and cash. I use a 401k for tax advantage, a roboadvisor, and an individual stock account.
There are many good reasons we went off the gold standard. I'd suggest learning them and leaving behind the fringe beliefs. You're really shooting yourself in the foot.

Misleading. The Fed is slowly raising interest rates, which means they're essentially taking cash out of the economy and literally burning it. The opposite to printing money. You people wishing for a crisis and societal meltdown are sick.  If you really want to bet against the system, you can buy short ETFs and waste your money that way. Bitcoin price will collapse if your sick wishes come true. Don't you get this? The market corrected in February by 12% and bitcoin went down 50%. It's correlated to the stock market. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:42:40
Bullish, as in, if there was actually a single asset in which blockchain technology was inexorably tied, it would be very valuable, but there isn't. So, for those who continue to mistake the value of blockchain with the value of bitcoin, it should be noted that bullishness on blockchain for the sake of it being the only valuable technology tied to bitcoin leads to the logical conclusion that bitcoin itself is worthless. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:40:51
That MIGHT help slightly, but is most likely irrelevant. You always pay a tax on capital gains, but yes, you can technically select which bitcoins you are selling which can either minimize the amount of capital gains you pay taxes on, or the rate at which you pay. If you have bitcoins that lost value, you can use those to make purchases and get a tax advantage. The accounting gets tricky, but I think you're mistaken regarding "replacing" new bitcoins with old ones. You get no tax advantage that way. Also, I seriously doubt any exchanges will optimize your account this way. If you use a single wallet, then there is no way you can select which specific coins to use. So, most likely, LIFO/FIFO rules are irrelevant.

 I'm not sure rampant inflation and a stock market selloff will correlate with bitcoin buying. If that was the case, i think we would have seen the price of bitcoin increase these last few days.

You can Google it. It's a standard term in finance and investing. Valuation fundamentals have to do with things like earnings, sales, revenue, yield, debt, EBITDA, price/earnings, etc., etc., etc. There are also concepts like margin of safety that are completely time tested to minimize risk and maximize return. In other words, minimize speculation. You should start understanding that companies like Apple, Google, Chevron, and Berkshire undoubtedly have inherent value....  the simple way to put it, is how reliable and predictable are the growth and earnings of a company, and how under or over- valued do you believe it's price/market cap are? If this is jargon nonsense to you, then it's best to admit naivete, and start learning.

In the 5 stages of grief, consider that you might be in denial right now. Hubris can be a tough thing to self-identify, but you're in total disagreement with the greatest minds in the investment world. It's currently at $6,777, almost a 70% loss in a month. With your valuation parameters, there is still no floor to the price. However, with speculative assets, there can be a rush effect to any selloff, where folks observing a large price decline will lock in whatever gain they made before the price goes below their purchase price. It's how every bubble popped in history. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:14:29
Damn. That's pretty hardcore, but not likely in our lifetimes. The Fed has simple tools to deal with the ballooning federal debt and inflation. Step one, inflate the debt away.

"For one, each time you buy, sell or use the currencies, that's a taxable event, since the IRS considers them an asset, not a currency. If you convert your bitcoin into cash to buy a cappuccino, you'll need to pay taxes at your capital gains rate."
I doubt this will ever change. It's a limited resource, so it's always going to be an investment asset subject to capital gains taxes. If that's the case, you take a big hit when you use it as a currency. I guess if the price stabilizes, you'd pay less in capital gains, but still. You pay sales tax plus capital gains for each purchase. And you buy it with earned dollars that are taxed. TIL that bitcoin users get triple taxed. There's a reason why Roth IRAs and 401ks are so popular.

We're talking about smart investing. There has to be value in its implementation. For example, look at BNSF railroad's plan to use blockchain to make tracking shipments more efficient and secure. Implementing it for the sole sake of keeping track of speculative buy and sell orders of an impractical digital currency doesn't hold much value. For example, with this stock market sell off, you would expect the value of bitcoin to go up if it was akin to gold, but the opposite happened, which is a very bad sign for it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:58:25
 You're wrong. First, what makes you think it will be bitcoin and not a better cryptocoin? The market cap of bitcoin is over 150 billion, and volatility is still a huge problem. Merchants won't accept payment from an unstable, volatile currency. You just can't get speculation out of this investment vehicle, so it's best to cut and run. Second, you have people like the Winklevoss dorks and McAffee saying it'll go to $1 million. That kind of thinking entrenches it as a speculative asset. Fundamentally, what is the stable price of bitcoin? I've heard $3,000, $20,000, $1 million, and zero. If this question can't be answered with widespread consensus, then you'll never get stability. So, this thought that bitcoin WILL get there is totally backwards. It won't. Keep it as a speculative investment, but just know that that's whay you're doing; speculating.

 If you read any value investing book, it will hammer into your head that chartists are always wrong. These folks will expend a ridiculous amount of time and resources to try to find patterns in historical price movements to ultimately determine whether now is a good time to buy or sell. This type of analysis tries to predict the inherently unpredictable collective psychology of all buyers and sellers in the market to try to gain an upper hand on all buyers and sellers. Where there is one chartist predicting one thing, there is always another predicting the opposite with equally sound reasoning and intelligence. Don't follow them. They'll be right sometimes and wrong other times. Learn to properly value an asset. And note, that an asset like bitcoin cannot be properly valued because it is not a value producing asset, unlike a stock in a company or a bond backed by credit.

It's a weird concept, that the dollar loses value to fuel growth and increase wealth for everyone who wants to participate, but that's what's happening. Might seem paradoxical, but it actually gives very effective monetary tools to prevent catastrophe. So, it loses value, but growth continues. It has paid to invest in that growth and stability.

But you're arguing for a bitcoin ETF. That's just plain stupid. Do you understand yet? It's like creating an ETF that just tracks Apple stock. Why not just invest in Apple?
