Could be a number of things. If you have your OS X firewall turned on, you need to add bitcoind/qt to the list and allow incoming connections.
You may have to set up port forwarding on your router for the OS X machine.
Also, it could just be coincidence, and when you run on Linux you're connecting to peers who need to DL the blockchain, and when you're on the OS X machine, it's connecting to nodes that already have a complete blockchain.
But that is weird, because I run bitcoin-qt on both my OS X and Ubuntu machines, and neither have that problem.

oh, wow. This is perfect. Thanks!

Not gonna lie. About a year ago I also thought Gox was a very secure place to hold my coins. 3-Factor Auth (yubikey and google auth) was my main selling point.
But the first time they had withdraw issues, I took all my coins out and put them in cold storage. Luckily I lost nothing, but I did have a false perception of security on gox.

I actually don't think it'll be very long. It seems like years, but if US regulators acknowledge the potential for bitcoin, they can green-light this project pretty quickly. Otherwise, it wont happen at all.
My thought on it though; bitcoins purchased through USPS will likely require identification, and possibly use a service that tracks the circulation of bitcoin sold at the USPS. This could give the government some leverage over bitcoin. That being said, it would probably do wonders for the viability of bitcoin as a financial service, and would certainly raise demand and competition for similar services.

Yeah, I already have that covered. I'm quite familiar with blockchain.info
I'm more interested in finding the patterns of bitcoin adoption, and trying to explain variations from country to country. This is more of an economics project.

Thanks! Very helpful sources!

Never trust third parties. Bitcoin is was designed for direct control. Never let any entity near your private keys. Make your own vanity address, its really easy, and doesn't cost much more than a few minutes.

Bitcoin is 3X the price I bought it at a couple of years ago. No stress here. In fact, I'm financially more stable now than when I bought it when I was still in college. So, meh.
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:23:07
Haha, yeah. I jumped off that ship as soon as there were whispers of issues. Lost nothing to them thankfully.
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:53:32
Yeah, I read up on recovering forks, and I know what needs to be done to do it. Thanks for looking out though!
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:15:59
That's what it's advertised to do. There's a section on how to incorporate typos. So it's possible, and probably worth a try!

That tool is only useful if you roughly remember what the password was. I fed it in like 20 different passwords and password variations I used. It was some combination of 4 of my passwords. It generated ~100,000 variations based on what I gave it and it figured it out.

Maybe, if you set up a bunch of bots to do tasks, then paid people to solve the captchas for your bots, then probably still no.

Just sayin', I did not see something hashing. I saw a graph on the mini-rig, the same one that's on their website. And I still have my preorders in, but seriously... This video kind of gave me less faith.

According to the info at Blockchain.info, the transaction was from one wallet to another wallet. Looks like someone moving funds to a new wallet.

Yes! There is no backing down now. Realistically, we're stronger than ever.

That's not true at all. I use mtgox. I get money out. I'm just patient and not greedy.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:55:19
Wouldn't that make bitcoin go up to $1000? That's a lot of money and a significant jump that should take years to happen. I think you're being a little hasty. Slow your roll.

Please, I want Newegg to accept BTC. I'd actually buy so much with it. I came here just to post that.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:16:29
Just saying, there are other anonymous markets besides SR. While not so popular, many major sellers have accounts on these other sites. Some older or more experienced buyers know this, and it doesn't slow down the black market trade much.  While most people are loyal to SR, and will continue to be once it's back up, I don't think we'll see a huge affect.

Mt. Gox is the best if you're trading &gt;$2,000 at a time. For smaller transactions, I suggest using cash deposits with bitstamp.

Darknet URLs stay in the darknet. That's like, darknet 101. Maybe I'm just old school.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:13:44
Just saying, the past 2 times the price spiked, it was followed by a massive sell out, crashing the price. If BTC is to succeed, it needs a steady, healthy, and meaningful growth. If the price went from $135 today to $1000 next week or even next month, it would fail miserably due to "volatility".   I mean it when I say you're being too hasty. Those of you who really believe we should push the price up using these tactics are just looking to make a quick buck. I call that greed.
*Also, I never said three years, I made no mention of exactly how long.

This is interesting. But aren't the MtGox servers located in Japan? Or are they disperse? Because I don't see anything happening in Japan.

CoinValidation: 
Basically, certain retailers will say they will only accept bitcoin from whitelisted addresses. These addresses are whitelisted because the coins in them have never been tainted (ie. mixed, sent to a known darknet adress, etc.). Basically it means certain coins will be less spendable. There is a lot of outrage about this for obvious reasons, most people are unaware they have "redlist" coins.
I'm pretty sure the way they do this is through colored coins. Although I'm not totally caught up on the concept and how they do it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:45:45
Exactly. And the more lag time means the more orders that are pilling up. Most of those orders are at market price, so the longer the lag, the more people stand to loose.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:05:23
haha, you made me chuckle.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:45:06
Who is trading with that much BTC? What could they possibly be doing with it....?
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:19:47
This comment was definitely totally true about a month ago. Now, it's semi-true. There is definitely a rise in the acceptance of bitcoins from small vendors and artists, which is a big gateway for them. Also, some EU countries are experiencing a bank collapse, which is making bitcoin a smart investment for them.
tl;dr Bitcoin is still in the process of mass adoption.

I have, but they don't have the selection of parts that newegg has. Plus, newegg is far less expensive.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:48:47
I couldn't agree more, and I think avalon is an example of this. Avalon built a mining farm, the units they sold are only a portion of the units they built. And from what I've seen from them, they have an incredibly vested interest in the success of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:52:14
I have the same question. Also, I pay for amazon prime, so do I still get prime shipping and whatnot?
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:56:09
The article makes a good point of this in the end. Most of us "post-bubble" holders are more committed to its success. I know I'm never going to sell during a DDOS.

Actually, I ordered mine in December, so I'm pretty sure I can still get a refund. I know they are still honoring some refunds for earlier preorders. I just haven't brought it up because I'm still optimistic. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:19:15
I still have mine for a few reasons.  
1. I have a yubikey for my account and one for withdrawing funds, plus application access. So my account is VERY secure.  
2. I trade larger amounts of coins, usually over $2,000, and I can easily move money to and from my personal bank (credit union) and my mtgox account.  
3. I've also had an account for about 2 years and it's just easier that way.  
On a side note though, I also have a vircurex account to trade litecoin and namecoin. I've also had that account for about a year and a half. I can easily trade lite/namecoin for BTC and move it to Mtgox for even easier trading with less fees than most other sites.
