Coinbase is a checking account. You don't keep your money there. A private wallet is a personal savings account. I still use the Coinbase exchange (as well as several others). If I could use a private wallet (savings account) to trade on all of the exchanges (checking account) I would.

I was pretty surprised by this. Last night I was unable to get to my money on the exchange. In order to access the coin I own on the exchange I needed to upload my license with NO warning.

At least the Shift card still worked.

Agreed. I mean, what if I had bots running last night using the API? I didn't but that's not the point. They're an enterprise level exchange. There is absolutely no excuse for this behavior on their part.

For all my projects at work I give the following lesson:
Bitcoin (capital b)  = Part of the original bitcoin block-chain
bitcoin (lowercase b) = ANY block-chain
Block-Chain (capitals) = Original bitcoin block-chain
block-chain (lowercase) = ANY block-chain

This isn't arbitrary.
Think of it like this. We don't have altunix or altlinux. We have Ubuntu, Centos, RHEL, MacOS, AndroidOS and so on. Generally these are referred to as *nix/nix systems when grouped together or providing a universal command. 
Explaining to executives that an "altcoin" is the same as a "bitcoin" but not the same as "Bitcoin" is a losing battle. This is all new and none of this is defined in stone, it's been less than a decade since block-chain was released to the world. We are making the standards, and they need to be enterprise executive ready.
