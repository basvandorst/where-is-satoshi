When i was 21 i got a bunch of credit cards and decided to go on a spending spree, I bought a car, A ton of clothes, Trips to the beach, Strip clubs, Private dances at $100 a pop, You name it, For a bout a year i was living it up, Then the 0% Intro APR expired and went to 22% APR, The minimum payments where more than i made in a month at my job working for $7.00 per hour, I couldn't pay so i ended up defaulting on all the debts and my credit was ruined for 7 years, I'm 29 years old now and my bad debts have been cleared and now i am in the process of building my credit from square one, The point is im 29 now i don't have a place of my own or even a car, But if i had not screwed up my credit things might have been different, So take it from me DON'T FUCK UP YOUR CREDIT.
The thing about credit is you don't realize you need it until you get older.

No, I don't suggest people should bet the farm on bitcoin, But i do think if you have some money to spare if you invest now you can still make a profit.
Either way the way the USD is going i know i personally had rather be holding a wallet full of BTC over a bank account full of USD.

It's volatile, Bitcoin could be anywhere from $1 - $500 per BTC within the same year, But people have found a use for Bitcoin and it's being more widely accepted so the price is irrelevant really, Even when it's exchange rate is $1 it's still more valuable than fiat money.
When it's low it's just another opportunity to buy.

Mt.gox is probably the ones doing all the pumping lately, Soon they will dump, You better watch out unless you want to get dumped on.
There are plenty of other trading sites, Bitfloor is just one of many that is seeing a spike in users fleeing from Mt,COX.

Arch bang isint that much more difficult to install and use and it usually idles at around 180mb of ram where ubuntu idles at around 500 - 700mb ram.
Ubuntu has alot of background services running that you don't need, More stuff running = higher ram use = more power use.

Sorry this happened to you, I hate scammers.
I think the best way to avoid things like this is to either use a trusted escrow that both parties can agree on or if it's a face to face meeting you should bring a friend or two with you so the scammer will think twice about trying to rip you off.

lol Good luck trying to eliminate a decentralized p2p system, The only way to stop it is to shutdown the entire internet and they won't dare do that.

Better go ahead and put in the sell order now, I would put it in at $49 because at $50 the ship will start to take on water and it wont float long after that, Maybe a few minutes until the large sell orders start rolling in then POP! Just like last time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:01:25
Please, Everyone, Do yourselves a favor and STOP USING MT.GOX
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:09:46
If it goes to $50 again it will crash shortly after, Speculation has caused the price to skyrocket, Most people are wise to Mt.gox now and have left and gone to other trading sites, When the bubble pops again Mt.gox will be powerless to stop the sell off. 
$46 is a good price to sell at right now, Or you could wait and see if it hits $49 again but if it does don't wait for it to hit $50 or you will be going down with the ship.

Totally safe, Don't forget to disable the firewall and never install updates of any kind as they always contain viruses.
Might want to go ahead and enabled the telnet daemon too and place all your bank account and credit card information in a plant text file on your desktop because hackers never look on the desktop.

Bitcoin is needed for internet transactions, Paypal is a monopoly and they are just raping people with their absurd fees, Bitcoin is going to kill paypal and maybe even kill debit cards too, Bitcoin IS the future of internet transactions.

Some employers frown upon bad credit history, They see it as a representation of who you are, Someone that abandons his financial obligations is just considered irresponsible in the eyes of a potential employer.
Now that would mostly depend on what kind of job you are applying for of course for example the manager at McDonalds wont give a shit about your credit history but maybe on down the line after you get out of college and decide to get a real job they might not think it's to cool.
But i guess it all depends on what path you want to take in life, Some people would greatly benefit from having good credit while for others it's irrelevant.
My plans are to one day own a house and most likely i won't have all of the money to buy it so i will need some credit on my side to help me a bit, I'm not looking to get underwater with a $100k loan, Just something simple like $20k tops, Plenty of houses in my area going for that and $20k could be quickly paid off within no time really.

Might be hard to find an attorney to create a contract that involves bitcoin, I mean they could print you up one and have you both sign it but will a court of law actually recognize it? That's the question.

I just encrypt my wallet with the bitcoin client then make a backup, I then take the backup and place it inside a truecrypt container after that i encrypt the truecrypt container file with gpg then i put the now 3 layer encrypted file on an encrypted flash drive and i give to a trained squirrel that lives in a tree in my back yard, The squirrel then climbs to the highest branch of the tree and waits for the Hawk to come snatch up the flash drive and take it deep into the forest where it is safely hidden, When i want to retrieve the flash drive i just use my Hawk whistle and the hawk brings it back to me.
@_date: 2013-02-27 23:01:36
Just thought i would post it since it mentioned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-13 18:01:55
Credit can still help you, Say you want to buy a small house for $20k or $30k and you only have 10 or 15k saved, Well if you got good credit you can get a mortage at a decent rate and go ahead and move in, If you didn't have good credit and can't get a loan then it might be years before you got a house of your own, Trust me living with family at age 29 is not fun, Sure i don't have much responsibilities but i also don't have much of a life either because when you live in someone elses house you are living on their terms not yours.

Good luck proving a Bitcoin address is linked to me in any way.

The last little bubble that popped a few days ago sent bitcoin down to $38 in a matter of minutes, Mt.gox froze trading to stop people from making a run on bitcoin, Bitcoin is a great digital currency but it's being manipulated by speculators with large amounts of BTC, $45 - $50 for Bitcoin is not a valid price.
Right now is a good time to sell if you have not already, Come april or may bitcoin will be back at 2011 prices.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:21:31
If it stabilizes at over $1,000 per BTC you will be crying "Oh god why didn't i invest at $65 back in 2013? WHY GOD WHY! 
Just like people are saying now back when bitcoin was like $0.50 per coin.
Those guys that got in first are Multi Millionaires now.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:32:31
No i was referring to the way the people on YCominator where talking about Bitcoin as if the price would deflate because there isin't enough bitcoins.

Not exactly, Technically gold and silver isn't legal tender anymore but people do still purchase things with it.
It would be hard to tell if someone accepted bitcoin as a method of payment anyway given the anonymous nature of bitcoin transactions, A bitcoin address doesn't actually identify you just the transaction that took place.
Besides the more government try to interfere with bitcoin the more attention they will draw to it and the more valuable it will become until people finally wake up and see fiat currency for what it is, Toilet paper, And start using it in the bathroom accordingly.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:23:53
Yep, And campbx is way better than Mt.Cocks.

Yes the same bug happening TWICE should be a great incentive to buy Bitcoins.
If it's happened twice already then what is going to stop it from happening again?
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:17:10
I don't think just buying bitcoin is a capital gain, Only when you sell them for USD, Any increase in bitcoin value while you hold them is an unrealized gain and thus not taxable.

The only thing is since bitcoin transactions are more or less anonymous if you loan someone a bitcoin then what insurance do you have they will pay you back? 
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:44:49
It's a theory of mine, But either way the demand to sell was there so strong it knocked the price down to $38 in about 10 mintues, That's called "A run"
People wanted out and they couldn't get out because Mt.gox became unresponsive and that is why bitcoin stablized.
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:51:33
There's other sites, CampBX is another good one too.
@_date: 2013-02-16 16:11:41
The USD is certainly not a good place to store wealth anymore, When the government increases the minimum wage they are not being generous, They are simply compensating for the devaluation of the USD, The money buys less and less every year.
In 1950 the average cost of a new car was $1,500 In 2013 The average cost of a new car is over $20,000, wages adjusted for the cost of living increases have not changed since the 50's.
i. e In 1950 you got payed less but the cost of living was way less, Today you get payed way more but the cost of living is way more = Wages have not changed.
So buy gold, Buy BTC, Buy ammo and toilet paper or even canned goods, But only and idiot would store their wealth in USD.

If you got in at less than what bitcoin is going for now then you should start unloading now, Now is not the time to be buying bitcoin, Just ask those idiots that bought in at the peak of the bubble at $50 lol.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:18:53
She is right though, People are so obsessed with the price they are hoarding bitcoin instead of using as a medium of exchange, We need the price to level off so people will stop speculating on it like a stock and start using it to buy and sell goods and services.
