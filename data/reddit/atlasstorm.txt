[betteridges law]( and all that, but still interesting choice for a CEO that supports Bitcoin

Thanks for the feedback! "I'm so exshitted" her words. This is such a great community.

She uses Shopify which has a Api integration with coinbase and bitpay. It's super easy to use. I would highly recommend Shopify!

Ha, you caught me. I was kinda hoping someone would ask. I'm super proud of her with what she's done. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:19:34
You're right, she is looking for the right supplier for the planters. LeAnn doubled your order for being her first Bitcoin user and should make those fees a little easier to swallow ��

You ever tried to set up multiple coinbase accounts?

so.... arhhh.... so... we are in living a communist plot spearheaded by the gays and young people who all went to a Frankfurt school? 
@_date: 2016-09-06 13:26:24


Gay rights is a weird scapegoat to bring up, sounds like you have a dog in this fight. And besides didn't conservatives start the war on terror? I think your looking through the telescope from the wrong end if you think this is political partisanship issue. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:43:51
I love you r/Bitcoin, you stay weird. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:40:53
Does he even have to mention the "war on terror" when the whole premise of breaking encryption is to fight terrorists to which he did mention. 
And to as far as blaming millennials and liberals fight for equal rights on policy makers trying to break encryption is about as weird as an old man yelling at the clouds. 
What would of I chosen in it's place? don't all of us have the power to vote, so I would blame all of us for voting in policy makers, even though Baby Boomers voters far out numbered any group in the last election.

[This]( is a definition of a Pyramid scheme. Please enlighten us all and correlate it to Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:33:13
Dude just admitted it was a joke. His career in crypto is over
