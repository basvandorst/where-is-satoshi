The Internet didn't appear overnight in 1995. 
People like to make an analogy between Bitcoin and the Internet in 1995, but it's more like the Internet in 1991 right now. Bitcoin today is like the Internet before the first browser was invented. We need the Bitcoin equivalent of the browser before we get 10% of adults using it.

2^256 comes from the number of possible 256-bit private keys generated by SHA-256. 2^160 is the number of possible bitcoin addresses because Bitcoin addresses are produced by hashing either a script or a public key with SHA-256, then hashing that hash with RIPEMD-160, which produces a 160-bit hash. A bitcoin address is formed from this hash by concatenating a version byte (indicating whether it's P2SH or P2PKH and whether it's a main-net or a test-net address), the hash, and a 4-byte checksum (used to check for typos), then it's encoded in base-58, not base-62, since it's all capital letters and numbers minus four characters that look too similar to others for usage in a Bitcoin address.

If you can't figure out how to download a torrent file, you can use a lightweight client like Electrum that doesn't need to run a full node. If you don't have bitcoind running continuously with a decent Internet connection, you're probably doing more harm than good for the network anyway.

P2SH and multisig are not the same thing. Multisig addresses use P2SH, but you can easily create a normal, one-signature-required address using P2SH instead of P2PKH.
