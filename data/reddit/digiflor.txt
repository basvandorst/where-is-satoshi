Great to see steady technological progress. Imho much more important than the constant chatter about Bitcoin's USD valuation.

What's clear is that in a deflationary environment, credit supply and indebtedness will shrink significantly as will excessive consumerism. Which I think is a very good thing. The current central banks inflationary paradigm is completely unsustainable in the real world, because it requires exponential economic growth to accomplish the debt service in future. It's already on the brink of collapse.
To be precise Bitcoin has not yet even reached its deflation phase from the standpoint of money supply. It is still inflating. However because demand far outmatches supply during the beginning of mass adoption it is felt like being in deflation mode.

Bitcoin is an outstandingly easy way of payment - especially (but not only) for cross-border transactions. The experience would be even better if businesses accepted Bitcoin natively without the fiat conversion crap. But this will need some time to happen...
For now any business that accepts Bitcoin is a big win for our free decentralized market money.

I doubt that. Platforms like Steam just too perfectly align with the spending habits of the average Bitcoiner. - Besides most of the damage has been done by incompetent or even malicious wallet providers, calculating a much higher fee than actually necessary.
