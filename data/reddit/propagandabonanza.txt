I'm in the same boat right now. Tried to verify direction on the withdrawal transaction about 3 times and it is not working. Been waiting about 2 days now, but I've done about 4 other withdrawals previously and never had a problem. It's really, really annoying. I've missed out on some pretty good gains because of this.
I really wish Bittrex would make it easier to purchase directly through their exchange.

Any idea what exchange you'll switch to? I've been thinking of switching after this as well.

Thanks for the heads up. I think that's my plan too unfortunately. I just hope it doesn't keep happening.

Also, this doesn't help your case. Just means Bitcoin itself is unstable and untrustworthy to use because you don't know when the fees might unexpectedly rise because of a hack. 
Also, there are other cryptos out there that are much, much better.

Lol dude if Bitcoin was having high transaction fees because of an attack then it's an unreliable currency period. No one wants to use a current like that. 
Also Bitcoin is not a very good crypto in general. It's too expensive power wise and is simply unsustainable. 
You should probably take your own advice. There's no point in posting unless you have something to add to the conversation. You just end up looking like a fan boy drinking in the kool-aid.

Shill boy? When did I once shill Visa and MasterCard? Lol
But now that you bring it up, if you read how much power Bitcoin was using, I bet it was more than visa and MasterCard.
You're just being a fanboy of Bitcoin right now. Honestly, I'm not trying to insult you. Take a step back and look at this conversation. You're responses don't even make sense to what I'm saying. 
I think crypto is a great idea, and I think it could potentially change the way we use money. I actually hope it does. There are some that I love, but Bitcoin is not one of them. 
It's a disaster. It just happens to be the most popular at the moment, but there's a really good chance it does not stay at the top.

What about Square Cash or Venmo?

Like how long have you been into crypto and block chain tech? You sound like someone who just thinks that anyone who doesn't like Bitcoin hates crypto in general. Bitcoin is not the end all be all dude. You told me to do research, but it sounds like you need to take your own advice.

Any relation to Tony Stark? If so, I'd say her opinions on tech are even more valid.
