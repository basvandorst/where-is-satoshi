I turned 40 BTCs into 90+ BTCs dabbling in alt coins, so I can't relate.

Bla bla bla. Just credit his money.

Lol, are you me? Same price, same year

I open two separate windows with the source (e.g. an exchange deposit address) and the destination (e.g. your Bitcoin wallet), superimpose one on the other. **Triple-check** all the characters, one on top of the other.
I wouldn't trust a checksum at all.
On a side note, I also fear waking up one day and having my wallets drained somehow. That's the bigger fear.

This presupposes that you have a lot of fiat at hand.

Does this apply to cashing out, i.e. selling Bitcoin for fiat? If so, I can possibly just cash out $600 every week and live off it, tax-free, right? Does this also apply to other crypto?

Then 50 years from now there will be complaints about a "gender wealth gap."

I damn sure will. I wanna spend my Ark dividends.

Do we have a list of enemies in the United States?

"Why spend $20 worth of Bitcoin when it may go up multi-fold in a year's time" is a reasonable question, but why spend $20 worth of fiat when you can use it to buy $20 worth of Bitcoin, which may go up multi-fold in a year's time?

And how many people know that? Ordinary people probably see Bitcoin as some indivisible stock. $2.7k is a very steep and intimidating price to the typical retail investor.

Anyone investing $10,000 hoping to reach the millions has to bet intelligently in the ICO market/small-cap alt coins with huge  upside potential. That's for sure.

This is the best idea. What defines a BTC anyway? There's nothing to stop us from defining a BTC as 100,000 satoshis, nothing but common agreement.

Hi! Thanks a lot for your reply.
1) What is a wallet file? Is it just a text file containing my private key?
2) How would you "issue keys"? Using Javascripts from Bitaddress.org?

The same can be said of stock splits...

There are actually people who made their first million, much less first $100k, from Bitcoin alone.

I've never thought about it this way. Hell, you would have to be a true believer **these days** to plop $70,000 into cryptocurrencies.

Have you tried to get verified on OKPay, which lets you purchase BTCs on a variety of exchanges (e.g. BTC-e, crypto-trade.com, etc.)? I live in a Southeast Asian country too, and I got same-day verification on OKPay.

"and the lesson that wisdom and age do not go hand in hand."
Drop this part from your speech, and you should do fine. :)

It's only a temporary measure. I'll cash out ASAP. I'm not "investing" in it, merely using it as an intermediary to transfer money.
