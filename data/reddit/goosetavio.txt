yea for your safety stop doing that. if you lose it your done, let alone if someone finds it/steals it. say goodbye to your life lol

do you think it has a threshold though? like if it goes back up to 18 do you think many people will sell and the same thing that happened yesterday will happen again?

this has to be the fastest depreciated care of all time. but its great you met your goal and bought one! to be fair i cant afford this car esp with just bitcoin, but honestly unless it was necessary, i wouldnt ever spend that much. considering the price went up like what 4k in a couple days lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:57
im just curious, but how do you think he did it? like what did he use to buy and sell it and do you think it was just one guy 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:31:52
yes. tbh its very stupid please for your own safety dont do that anymore. what do you keep it in there for??

the problem is i cant really find another supplier, i basically commission him as an artist as not many people can produce what he does. but you are very right, about them being competitive, just afaik he has 0 competition

oh dang. well i guess rip me. just curious, how is it banned? like how can you get caught using it, and can you not access it w a vpn? these are questions out of curiosity im not trying to pressure my dude to do something illegal as i cant afford him to be picked by the gulag

If this matters, not all these people are companies. some are small independent people.

i mean less fees but i completely forgot china banned crypto so my post is kind of pointless now. i remember the articles being posted on here but it just never crossed my mind lol. tbf they never said the reason was bc its illegal

OP please be honest was this all for the reddit karma. Great execution btw

Bitcoin is a currency though, meant to be traded like the USD/yuan/pound etc. If it just keeps getting daytraded all the time its never going to be useful because nobody will use it for its real intention.
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:03:53
Its just so awesome knowing that you can send $1M + and it cost a few bucks in fees. like that gives me a boner thinking about it, but i dont imagine it will ever be stable enough for it to work in my lifetime.
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:38:17
But the opposite of THAT can happen too and I lose $500 for literally no reason other than I wanted to use a volatile currency
I dont want my business cash to be in basically a casino until i cash it
edit: i know i sound repetitive about the opposites thing but my point is i dont want to risk losing or gaining $500. of there was only a chance i could gain $500 fuck yes id do it but its not the case
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:27:36
Again another comment of “wait until im right” comment. 
sorry for getting caught up in the mumbl jumbo of using a cryptoCURRENCY as currency. Until it can be used as such its just a ticker.

i love how all the comments end w a condescending “youll regret the day when btc is a trillion and its the only thing holding society together!!”
btc is useless rn other than a way to make a quick buck. its real life applications suck.

this pile of crap was worth a bitcoin back when i "should've" bought

those arent real crimes though. White nationalists are a way bigger issue.
