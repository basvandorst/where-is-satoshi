I completely agree with your points, but you aren't an "insider". 
In the financial world, an "insider" is someone who has inside (i.e., private/non-public) information which makes their opinion more valuable/knowledgeable than an outsider. 
Bitcoin doesn't have any "insiders". I think this is an important point to make as to not confuse people. You're well educated and well versed on the topic, but not an insider.

I think the article itself is more interesting than it being on the frontpage of Digg.
I think it brings up some serious concerns regarding bitcoin transactions while the currency is so volatile. Granted, that example is spanning more than 2 years so it's a bit of an extreme case, but when a currency is up 600% in 4 months, it's a strong incentive to just hold it and not actually exchange it for any goods.

You should be more concerned with numbers that prove it isn't a bubble and if there's legitimate reasons why the price is 10x what it was 6 weeks ago. The lack of proof is why people are labeling it a bubble; the burden of proof isn't on them when their proof is that there is none.

I bought at 23$ from there, it took 6 days to process and the price went up above 30$. They still only charged me the 23$ I was quoted.
It works both ways, or used to. Now I believe you place an order for how much USD you want to spend and you will receive the market price in BTC once they get the funds from your bank.

I feel like the only "serious conversation" people want to hear here is how awesome bitcoin is and how it's going to hit 1000$/btc. Largely an investors forum/community in here, despite what they say.

For your "bubble" evidence, you cherry-picked two successful companies and compared their price in 2000 vs 2013, a 13 year stretch. 
Anyone skeptical of bitcoin would do more research into the dotcom bubble you're comparing against, see that $5 trillion dollars in market value was lost by 2002, and find counter examples such as Cisco who peaked at ~80$ in 2000 and currently trades at ~$20, for a 75% loss. Yahoo went from 108$ in 2000 to ~5$ in 2002, currently back up to ~23$ for ~80% loss.
But all of these comparisons are terrible as they're trying to compare stock price of a company to the price of a cryptocurrency. There's no point in trying to make them to self-assure about the rapid rise in the value of bitcoin.

You should see if they have a section for mathematics or economics textbooks if you're seriously trying to paint BTC as nonvolatile because a precious metal dropped 5 times *less*....

I think you need to look away from any of these "X theory"'s and look at how governments operate today. IMO, the cons outweigh the possibility of a currency boom/get-rich-quick movement in adopting first. 
Every government needs taxes to stay afloat and provide even basic, necessary services to their citizens.  How are the governments going to survive this? Would all payrolls need to be done in bitcoin so taxes could be collected then? Also, a lot of countries wouldn't want to give up their ability to create monetary policy.

Not to mention how much of this market cap is actually used, rather than hoarded to sell at a higher price? That's more important to the price of btc in the long run.

The more important question is what do farmers want that they can buy with BTC? Why would they want to accept BTC if they're going to need to convert it to some other currency in order to buy the items they want?

IMO it isn't the memes that are the problem, it's that has turned into a place where people only upvote positives stories/memes/images/tweets that affirm what they want to hear about bitcoin (mainly the price skyrocketing). There's really not that much discussion of bitcoin going on, more about the price of it.

That's a good analogy in terms of not risking more than you can afford to, but hard to take seriously since leaving money outside isn't an investment at all. Might as well say don't invest more than you could give away and not lose sleep over.

More volatile than btc?

I agree, but the consumer still needs to be willing to part with something that's been going up in value at a ridiculous rate. Why pay with bitcoins if 100$ today might be 150 or 200$ next month?

Sometime in the future there will be a case where a terrorist or hostage taker demands bitcoins for the ransom... once the media finds out they can get this form of payment online in an anonymous and untraceable fashion, and how even if a majority of bitcoin users wanted to try to track the transactions they could easily launder them through the many laundry services on the deepweb, they're going to be painted as tools of terrorism and essentially legislated out, killing their value and mass adoption.

Do you physically hold your silver? Because if the dollar crashes, some serious shit has gone down and I'm willing to bet you'd never see whatever ounces of silver you own from some stock exchange stored who knows where.

He didn't say the *only* use is for illegal transactions, he said the only use where bitcoin is the best option is for illegal transactions.
I tend to agree, I don't see how ordering something from Amazon through a 3rd party website with BTC is easier than ordering from Amazon with my debit/credit card. It's more of a hassle.

If someone grows up wanting an English Bulldog (which you will just about never find in a pound), why are they the asshole for buying one? I've adopted 3 dogs from shelters in my lifetime, but in the future if I want a specific breed that I can't find in a shelter, I might seek out a breeder.

Resulting in a 45 minute lag from MtGox? Doubtful.

I highly doubt an English Bulldog puppy was available in the pound. If it was, they must have been there the minute it came in because that dog would go fast.

If you're looking at bitcoin in terms of a company/industry, then yes I suppose that there could be insiders that could move before the market.
If you look at Bitcoin as a currency though, which was my original mindset, I'm not sure the term insider can apply. There's no law against "insider trading" on foreign currency exchange because it isn't really possible, or at least deemed to be non-prosecutable. Being a new currency muddies the water.

This is assuming he has the ability to qualify for a mortgage without showing his btc holdings. He may or may not be in that boat.
