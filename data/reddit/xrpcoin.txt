You know they're integrating Ripple, right? It's surprising how many people don't know this.
@_date: 2016-08-24 13:53:46
Or, the more likely outcome... banks integrate Ripple as 90+ have already done and increase their settlement speed from days down to a matter of a few seconds. And they can do that right now. Bitcoin is nowhere near commercially ready.  It's like going back to the horse and a bag of loose parts to build a buggy.

LocalBitcoins is high risk for selling, especially so if you use Interac e-transfer to an anonymous person you have never seen nor met.  First of all, it's reversible.  Secondly, you don't know if the person sending you the coins are buying them for illegal purposes.  If any of your buyers got taken down by law enforcement for illegal drugs, weapons or porn then you are flagged as well.  Too bad.  I will probably never touch LocalBitcoins nor advise anyone to sell there.

Bitcoin shares none of the attributes described.  The text describes a kind of centralized, global government dictated system of trading.  It's purely superstitious to attach this to Bitcoin.  Just think how many other mandatory codes people carry around with them in terms of Social Security Numbers, passports, driver's license, Visa / Mastercard /AMEX, barcodes / QR codes, etc for decades now - and most are mandatory to have for basic living.  I cannot deny the risk of a small chance in the next 100 years where a global centralized system is pushed but I don't think we are anywhere near that yet (I hope not!!) and it probably won't be a decentralized system like Bitcoin.  Like any average person, you probably already have a large number of codes associated with your identity.

Amazing work. The depth goes so far beyond anything Newsweek released, and shows actual logic and scientific approach.  I would be willing to bet that Satoshi was a the time a savvy Computer Science student or very recent graduate when he created Bitcoin.  It's probable he was single and living at home or financially independent in some way so as to give him the time and focus.  An age range of 22-26 years old seems appropriate.  I've met many personalities very similar to Satoshi - brilliant programmers who are highly intelligent although very reclusive (even in the online world) and preferring anonymity.

His arguments are completely filled with errors and a poor conclusion. It's just an opinion piece. He's looking at Bitcoin from an "as is" perspective if all development freezes rather than what is coming down the road as new innovations and companies are added to the ecosystem.

$4,500 - I believe at least 5x growth is realistic based on the proven momentum in the past few months in terms of venture funding, retailer adoption, increase in user base, ATM rollouts, etc.  The only thing still holding it back will be regulations and/or uncertainty thereof.

Easy as buying $500,000 worth of Bitcoin on Mt. Gox today (~$250).  Wait until Thursday when BTC withdraw opens and send them out to another exchange to sell for 2.5x the price... Or just wait for Gox price to go up until it's double.  Of course, this is all assuming they are not insolvent and you don't lose your money.

The best outcome I see is that they need to put everything up for sale immediately so money and loans can be raised to insure their customers.  Any loan will have to come from private investors or other exchanges.  The best structure is to have two separate corporations - one as the exchange holding company and one as the trust fund which will receive interest payments on behalf of investors recouping their loan.  Mark needs to go.  This takeover needs to happen as soon as possible so customers have a hope of getting their money back and stability returns again.  My honest hope is that Mark knows how badly he screwed up and that he works out a recovery with new ownership.

Regulation is already done with a solution that would be compliant immediately. They can start by doing internal Bitcoin transfers within the post office network right now. What I mean is, just digitally "stamp" each Bitcoin sold in the blockchain and allow it to be redeemable at any other post office that is able to verify the stamp issued. These Bitcoins have already been through AML process at USPS and can then be spent anywhere in the world since Bitcoin is an international network. However, USPS will only be able to redeem its own stamped Bitcoins until the day that federal regulation allows any Bitcoin to be redeemed - due to possible lack of info where it came from. This setup should require no more regulation than existing money services they do right now, and will provide instant transfers to any post office in the country. If I'm wrong on this, call me out on it but I believe this would allow them to operate within current licenses and regulations. The main issue is that USPS will need to buy an initial float to cover what they issue. That could maybe come direct from private or commercial miners as their suppliers. USPS as an exchange will be very very good for Bitcoin. They have potential to provide the biggest Bitcoin-based remittance service in the world, and it can be done within a year.

Your explanation of the transaction "audit" process could be misunderstood that there are humans looking at personal transactions and processing them.  It would have helped to explain that it's an automated process with many levels of verification (confirmations) for extra security.

If you can get a 0% or 1% rate for 6-12 months it might be worth a shot if you are comfortable with the risks.  If you're paying 18% interest then I guess that depends on whether you think Bitcoin price increases will beat that over the long term.  That's a little tougher.

From what I read about Jed's opinions on XRP, he originally intended the majority of them to be broadly distributed for free and this became an issue.  OpenCoin / Ripple Labs came to disagreements with that and all the free giveaways ended around the time Jed left.  Him selling his 9 billion XRP may be the only way to ensure his original goals are met.  His 2 week advance warning makes it obvious that he doesn't care about getting full value, otherwise he would be quietly selling gradually. He has enough to crash the price to zero at least momentarily.  If that happens, it will allow anyone in the market to grab a ton of XRP at a very cheap and reasonable price.  Overall this will spread the distribution more fairly and make XRP a more attractive store of value once it starts to climb in price again.

By "wrapped", they mean the vinyl graphics wrap.  The graphics aren't painted.

More likely they are just moving funds around. Where is there any proof of this FUD rumor?

If VirtEx can fix the shady looking site design I think they'll officially be the most professional Bitcoin exchange in the market apart from Coinbase.  Great to see a company doing it right!

All wishing we bought more.  For most people, it was not a life-changer.  Many were jealous of the 1000 BTC millionaires who had the foresight to buy a lot of it last year.

Block reward.  It's actually 50 BTC which works out to around $31401.

Haha wow that is some crazy work!  I enjoyed it :)

This is BRILLIANT!!  These guys know what they're doing.  Go big and get the market first.

Did you have 2 step verification turned on?

I am predicting it's more likely there will be a sharp increase in price as the paranoia dissipates and money sitting on the sidelines comes back in.  Look around at all the commentary online for proof.  Most buyers are waiting until we've cleared the 31st.

Satoshi pops his head up 5 years later to dispel the rumours... wow.  At least he's not dead.  This is exciting.

More than 1.6 BTC now... mind blowing.  The community was really impacted by her story.

I think Matt has the only common sense perspective I've ever seen on Bloomberg regarding Bitcoin. None of the other anchors have bothered to learn anything about it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:19:30
The Bitcoin exchange community needs to start some sort of formal security audit standards.  These rampant thefts are causing unending embarrassment.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:06:27
Good. Gox has done enough damage.  I don't know why they still have any influence.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:21:27
Personally I think this feels like deja vu all over again.  It's following many of the patterns of spring/summer 2013 after that big April bubble popped.  Bitcoin had a sharp dip to $60 momentarily and then we never saw those prices again.  What a chance that was!  Will this be the same?  Nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:51:04
I should mention that point 6 changed quite a bit in 2014 with a few flagship retailers accepting Bitcoin online, but it was unfortunately very limited in scope and support (US only, specific products / services, etc).
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:40:54
Adoption rate needs to overtake inflation rate.  This has not happened consistently yet, except the rare hype of a bubble where a handful of tech-savvy people dig into it and go on wild buying sprees.  Unfortunately Bitcoin is still a terrible mass consumer product and generally drives a lot of the average public away.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:46:19
There needs to be an exchange on both ends of the transaction so the recipient can actually get some cash.  Otherwise, what is the guy in Timbuktu going to do with a Bitcoin?  It's as worthless as a pile of sand to him if he can't buy anything with it locally.  Maybe this will change in the long-term, but Bitcoin is nowhere near being any kind of global currency (yet).
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:42:54
Thanks!  Is there any way to estimate how much has been loaned out?
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:42:36
On any normal exchange, the fee is only taken when an order is executed.  If you cancel an order, you pay no fee.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:06:51
Bitcoin in its current form is not likely to ever be a mass-market product.  Nobody likes the value of their money dropping catastrophically within a day.  Ripple at least understands this, hence why they allow any currency to be sent through their network without being pegged to an internal currency.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:25:57
Hahaha I love it!
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:41:01
You're exactly right.  I read some comments from the original owner and he basically made a conscious decision not to sell.  I understand his perspective, considering the numerous breaches of trust in the Bitcoin space. The guy had some integrity and I respected that.  He realized he was in over his head technically and operationally and did the honest thing to shut it down rather than put his users at risk.
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:43:05
Anyone else missing Bitmit? Too bad it shut down. I was really hoping someone would buy it. :(

Cuz they've been busy testing Ripple instead, over 100 of them so far...

Bitcoin will follow natural market forces. Labour, equipment and electricity are often cheaper in China.

I'm addicted in the sense that I've been bagholding since 2014 and won't sell at a loss.

Edit: Looks like the only way is to register the address in the Settings. You could always wait for withdrawals to open and trade back to BTC or fiat, but it's up to you.  If you want, I can try find a charity to donate them to.  Not many folks accept LTC these days so it's probably a matter of donating to one of the developers.

You're not the first. Contact Dave from Wallet Recovery Services and he might be able to help you out. He has a huge amount of positive feedback on Reddit and BitcoinTalk if you want to verify - he seems legit. His website:

I downloaded BitcoinQT when I didn't know anything. Didn't bother me too much.  It was something cool and interesting to learn about.  Of course, it was far faster to download the blockchain than it is now.

That tiny box looks like you could just pick it up and walk off with it. I doubt it holds much cash and no doubt it will need to be bolted to a steel girder to be safe from theft!

Well you got very close to $1,300 on Gox exchange this week.  Good call.  Let's see if it goes to $2,400.  Maybe there is no bubble and it just keeps going up.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:31:39
All the exchanges have been hit with massive demand and are just getting overloaded.  A friend of mine has been told that it will be 10 business days just to even get verified.  I'm trying to get verified on another exchange and it has been almost a week already.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:30:50
Do your research.  I always recommend dealing with local exchanges if at all possible.  Why wouldn't you use VirtEx? They have great BTC rates!
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:58:47
That was a class act.  I was very impressed with the thoroughness of his research and that he presented an actual unbiased perspective with real facts.  It was a breath of fresh air compared to the sensationalism and amateurish journalism of most mainstream outlets.

I like this idea far better than any other suggestion that has come forward so far.

Virtex has very good service normally.  With the Bitcoin market going wild right now I think they are just overwhelmed.

If these are honestly earned coins, I say congrats to the guy!  Great risk taking at any price point.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:48:00
Since Bitcoin is a very speculative and high-risk currency, most people have not put much into it.  They've dipped a small toe in a big risk pond.  Nobody really cares about a 10-20% price swing anymore.  People bought in with full expectation that it's volatile.  In the long-run, it appears to have a steady upward momentum and it doesn't make sense to jump ship.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:10:32
Yes, Ripple already does something similar and you can get commission if you are a gateway issuing IOUs.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:55:38
Global Bitcoin growth has enough momentum to fill in for any slowdowns in China.  Bitstamp, Gox and VirtEx exchanges are overwhelmed by so many new signups that it takes 10 days just to get verified.  Wait 2 weeks and you will see.

Little chance of that happening.  The inflow of new buyers is increasing too quickly now.  You might see some small dips but this could easily go past $300 within a month.

Bitcoin, the world's ultimate savings account.  Wait until the Interac cards launch and nobody will want a normal bank account anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:13:50
Done. When are the cards coming out?  I know it's a bit early still, but it would be pretty neat to show a physical card when friends and family bring up Bitcoin.
