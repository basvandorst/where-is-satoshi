Yes...the same problem every blockchain currently has.
Only ethereum is currently dealing with it better than bitcoin and bcash better than ethereum. 
This isn't a tit for tat situation of mine is better than yours.
Personally I think Ethereum will scale first and bitcoin devs will still be left arguing.

Haha give it 6 months. Bitcoin is done for, primarily because of this god awful community. I was once a big fan of bitcoin.
So many communities out there that have a better focus and eventually, bitcoin will be nothing.

Of course. But they either bring about centralisation or security risks. (Which is obviously the path bcash has taken)
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:47:57
Why should they give a shit? What benefit is it to them? Maybe scaling effectively would be a better solution instead of bitching about Coinbase lol

"If the devs decide to raise the block size"
Yes because that has been easy and is likely to happen in the near future \s
It currently costs $0.67 to send whatever you want on the ethereum network. As opposed to $30 for bitcoin.
"Would you rather use ether or bitcoin for your 10k transfer sir?"
"Ah, sticking with the old dinosaur because you are loyal"

Why should bitcoin recover for this?

Ethereum has many of the greatest dev teams in the world currently working on scaling. Raiden, Plasma, child chains whatever.
Bitcoin has the devs arguing constantly over whether they should increase the block size by a mb or not.
Let's see which one gets there first. My money is on ethereum.

In case you didn't see, basically there was a bug that was telling people they should pay more gas than they needed. So people were paying 60 cent rather than like 10 cent.
Regardless of that though, 60 cent for a transaction on a network that is already doing 4x the numbers of transactions that bitcoin is doing is pretty good.

This is garbage. People are buying eth hence the ratio increasing. Because of the actual use cases...of which there are literally none for btc.
I will admit there are drawbacks to eth, and eth may be superseded by NEO or whatever the best smart contract coin is. But bitcoin has literally nothing going for it currently other than LN which doesn't work properly, and segwit which is average.

Nice store of value dropping from $20k to $10k in a matter of months.
"Yeah, let me store my value here so I get half of it back" 
You guys are delusional. Nothing left for bitcoin so we will pretend it is like gold. Sell and buy eth already.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:46:55
Store of value lol. That is also what I like to call any crypto that has been defeated in its' initial purpose. 
If you think that in an economic crash bitcoin will be a store of value you are deluded my friend.
But yes bcash is a good alternative for transfering money, but again if it was used transactions would increase and eventually it would occur the same problem.
It can't do 5 mill a day.....it can do 24 a second currently. So 2 million a day. But agree, bcash is obviously a better alternative to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:31:30
Nothing 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:06:13
So it is worse than bitcoin even thought it costs 60 cents for a transaction when the network is processing 4x the number of bitcoin transactions?
Yes we are the ones with the scaling problem......

I am worried that someone will now be able to "own" bitcoin without that transaction ever affecting the price. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:09:09
I wish more shops knew about this. The fact that accepting bitcoin is cheaper than standard methods really says it all. Have an upvote.
