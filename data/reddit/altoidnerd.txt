My man - it's a transaction medium, not necessarily an investment.
As a means of transferring wealth, I'm just not convinced it's possible to "stop Bitcoin." I can't imagine how ...
@_date: 2016-04-21 21:37:50


Isn't this already the case?  I think this is already the case. 
Yet Bitcoin is still here. There's a difference between what you're saying - which does happen all the time - and "bringing Bitcoin down."  The latter is hard - you can beat Bitcoin down but making it go away is probably impossible.
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:21:17
The technology is nowhere NEAR user friendly and it may never be. Cryptography is *always* hard. So that might keep joe and Jane away from Bitcoin always.
I think we basically agree to be honest!

Try gvim, but you still have to use "i" and esc and  :q, :w...etc.  Golden tip is :x is save and quit.
Man windows.  You can right click like anything and it knows what you want.  It's time we show some respek for windows.
That said, you are also completely undervaluing the ease of programming in linux.  It is insanely convenient.  Both OS's are excellent.

You got it...I fresh installed linux on another workstation without drive encryption and had no problems.  I used bootstrap.dat this time, which in retrospect was barely worth it, so we will see if that causes a problem.

I think the economics of money printing machines has not been explored yet and we are doing so. 
I respect your concerns. I believe our differences lie in what we've left unsaid in our arguments. I hope we can continue to explore this problem as we develop our thoughts and as you have mentioned...produce evidence. 
I'll leave you with this: I have as an axiom that ASIC chips, for the manufacturers, are in incredible abundance. That lies beneath my thinking.

Maybe I have to fix the path. libsparsehash is installed on /users/me/ ; blockparser is located /users/me/btc/blockparser
I'm just guessing now. libsparsehash is a really big thing.  take a look at
/sparsehash-1.10/README.  I do not understand what this is saying but it seems quite important:
To compile test applications with these classes, run ./configure
followed by make.  To install these header files on your system, run
'make install'.  (On Windows, the instructions are different; see
README_windows.txt.)  See INSTALL for more details."

That actually surprises me because I thought that despite win 8's horrid UI (they took my *fucking start button away from me*) it has some optimizations that would enhance processing.  Interesting.
Perhaps it was that the win 8 UI is more demanding and drains resources.  FYI, while I use win7, I dont have any transparent planes or anything..I used the classic high contrast themes and this helps a lot too.

There are a few facets to this. First of all, when everyone in the business is using X, you will too.  It's that simple.  A DJ insisting on using another OS would be like an open source dev hell bent on using windows.  It just stupid.
How did this happen? Well, Windows XP could never be trusted for, say, a 10 or 20 GB file transfer back in the days when that would take hours.  It would fail.
Basically, MACs could be walked away from and trusted to run smoothly and complete a command, even if the computer was extremly overwhelmed running it.
Windows is now much better and can be left alone on a long process.  At the same time, 8 hour file transfers do not hardly exist anymore as speeds have all hiked up.
SO there is truth historically.  Now its more of an industry standard/software issue.  I do not know anyone in graphic design, or any DJ, or anyone who runs a semi serious recording studio that does not use mac.  **anyone**

I'll out up a guide later on how to duplicate the analysis on excel. I do recommend Mathematica though. I put in some code there to add GUI controls to make plots that move as you change parameters around. Excel cannot, AFAIK, do dynamic updating.

Yeah we got a different error now:

Anyways, here's what I did differently to get that result...thats the output of my make attempt.
I straight up copied the google directory into /blockparser before proceeding. look: 
This is because I extracted the libsparsehash tarball elsewhere.  Should I try to extract its ass directly into blockparser?
And yes I obviously will do that no matter what you say, but it seems like youd know why or why not thats a good idea.

I'm quite certain you're failing to understand the complexity of the issue.


This holds if the hashower you intend to introduce is much smaller than the network hashrate.  If that's the case, then it is always profitable to start mining.
It is not necessarily profitable to mine with all of your hashpower if what you introduce is a significant fraction of what is currently online, for a multitude of reasons.
1) potential devaluation of bitcoins due to suspicion
2) should other miners be dong the same (restricting hash power), introducing more will cause opponents to do the same, making the end result a zero sum game, with electricity losses.

Hmm interesting. Does this mean I can command core to prohibit my accidental expenditure of coins allocated to the specific address? If so that pretty much does the trick...and I won't have to use pywallet.  Only reason I am trying not to is because I never have.

There is a fork of sx called bx I guess.  
I am sort of confused, trying to wade through it now.  I have sx installed on my big fat box, so I am going to have to change this right away.
It might be a bit dangerous to allow sx to calculate hashes incorrectly.

You should set up and run the reference client on a personal PC. This way getting used to the bitcoin core protocol.
Because in the meantime Wikipedia could simply have a static donation address I'm sure would be sprinkled with coins. In the long run I can imagine Wikipedia could work out a bitpay solution for generating unique addresses for Wikipedia donations, without the need to necessarily convert to fiat immediately.
You can then convert the coins to fiat as needed (if ever).

Yesterday I was attempting to create a bootable USB stick and ended up wiping out every song I ever downloaded off naspter, back when it was fresh and all.
How?  1 letter
`dd if=/home/kali-linux.iso of=dev/sdc1 bs=512k`
But sdc1 was my music, and sdb1 was what I meant.  In a fraction of a second, I fucked myself so hard.
See my point?  Simple is better in more ways than one.

It's not that easy to hide your hash, if you really have that much.  
There is absolutely NO WAY that ghash.io happens to own just enough hashpower to not freak everyone out.  In fact they do freak people out.  No.  They own much much more and bring it online slowly because that is the most profitable way to mine,
Mining too fast (within a 2016 block interval especially) will frighten investors and perhaps risk the devaluation of bitcoin completely.
@_date: 2014-07-18 07:55:22
Interesting.  This does seem easier (its essentially the inverse of) what I was fearing - raw transactions to drain the account except for her address.  Seems too easy to make an error though.  On the other hand, there's nothing less comfy than unfamiliar bitcoin software.  Brother.
If pywallet can do that, I will practice one an unrelated account, make sure I can do it well, and yes.  Ok thanks.

No it's not to surprise an attacker. You Hold onto hardware without putting it online so as to not scare anyone if the diff jumps too quickly. I have said this repeatedly. 
The side effect of this is that there is hash power sitting perpetually, with competing parties each nudging one another to add more.

Computers are (regardless of your OS of choice), the CHEAPEST tool you can buy, considering what it does for you.  Think about it.  It's true as *fuck*.

hmm, I have never used pywallet before.  I'll play with it a bunch before doing anything.
I definitely know how to dump and import her key somewhere else. But Im not sure how to do this elegantly.  I either need for my legacy account to forget her address, or I need to move all my coins somewhere else, which is fine with me - but  can't spend them now...that's the crux there.  I dont want to move my coins out for fear of intertwining the shit too much.

Im sorry but this is simply not the case - not if doing so will destroy the network, which has likely happened many times in history.

My only supposition is that ASICs are being produced very quickly now.  From this I'm quite certain one concludes the complicated strategy that emerges is for any entities having great amounts if ASIC in stock must 
1) add hash power sort of quasi-statically over time (can't just turn it all on at once)
2) must do so at a rate that doesn't exceed a critical one that will devalue bitcoins in general for a number of economic and political reasons

On a changed landscape where, since 2012, it has been possible to manufacture equipment that functions in a way that is most closely approximated by the old notion of "minting money."
The economics of mining digital currencies is not *case closed.* I think it has hardly been explored. The strategy is very complicated.  There are regimes where launching too much hashpower has diminishing returns, not unlike the plight known as tragedy of the commons.
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:41:41
I don't want to say specifically, except that perhaps some users here may understand.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:46:17
Yes absolutely.  As I have mentioned, in the limiting case that I have so much hashpower I could start mining now and mine say 3000 out of the next 3600 bitcoins tomorrow, I would not be doing myself a favor.
Economics dictates that hashpower is introduced slower than is possible in practice.

Yeah, windows is incredible for how far it has come in its ability to work on any manufacturer's hardware in roughly the same manner.
As for macs:
In an ideal life I have all three OS's on hand.  OSX has perks...but I think this was more true for me in 2010 than today.  I don't desire the apple as much as I used to.  I used to think of my mac as being the trustworthy soldier - I could set it going on a process that could take days and depend that that process will finish.  Windows would almost certainly fail and terminate if left alone for that long (at that time).
But the tides have turned.  And since i'm not a graphic artist, I don't care if I have an apple anymore.

good idea let's check
Doesn't seem so:
`altoidnerd cd blockparser

`[sudo] password for altoidnerd: `
`info: starting command "closure"
info: Building address equivalence graph ...
fatal: Invalid argument: failed to open block chain file /home/altoidnerd/.bitcoin/blocks/blk00000.dat

Could it be some picky thing, like that I have the parser at /home/Downloads/blockparser  whereas bitcoin is /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin ?

Yeah windows 8 was like ... jesus.  I couldnt find "my computer."  
I hope windows 9 is good.  Windows 7 is still just fine though so I don't know what it could possibly bring to the table.
Also I just wanna say to everyone...we owe some of this admiration to the series of processors that began with core 2 duo (but I would say the real turning point was the i5).  Man.

No man but flipside.  Linux is like a birthday party for downloading "drivers" which are known as dependencies...linux just flies through things that are super stupid in windows.  
Windows is wasteful...linux recylces/shares depdencies, and windows just stacks more "drivers" which are degenerate and bloated and more piles on until you are using a shitbox.
Straight up.  Lifestyle machine is windows.  Development workhorse?  Gotta be linux my friend, or you'll waste a lot of time.

ASICs can be produced MUCH faster than they are being put online. No miner dares increase the diff so much in one period to create a condition which devalues their bitcoins mined.  That is why hash power is introduced at the rate that it is. 
The limitation is on what the network users will tolerate as a risk. Not on ASICs there are plenty of those in existence waiting for their time.

You're making me consider what exactly more RAM and pure processing power has let the electronic composer do.
In principle the same final cut of some modern electronic piece could have come out of a pentium 3.  But the composer would not have been afforded the same creative process to arrive at the end result.
Specifically, since fewer simulataneous tracks would have been playable...a modern piece would have required much foresight...the composer would have needed to compress early in order to hear each track together in the final cut.  
It would be interesting to go and use an old box and try to grapple with mixing all along, making irreversible decisions as you go to save computing might.  Would the result end up sounding, well, "so 90's?"
I could go on all day.  It's an interesting subject.  Basically, today, almost everything is dynamic and reversible until the final mastering.

I can almost guarantee you that at all times there is hash power sitting around that is not online, ready to come online in the event if a sudden surge threatening a 51.
Bitfury and ghash.io have much more hash power than they use. I suspect other entities do as well. They are ready to put it online if they can do so without creating a scare. Likewise, it is ready to go in the event of a sudden increase. 
This is because these pools have every interest in protecting the network. 
Any cost estimation of an attack is a guessing game. These numbers presented here are certainly low for the reasons I explained.

The amount of hash were talking about can't just be suddenly dumped on a pool without raising brows. 
The other catch is that increasing the network hashrate significantly encourages others to add more to compensate resulting in zero sum. 
I'm working off a model where I suspect there is much more potential hash power than what is online. In such a world there are limits to how much a single miner desires to add at a given time so as to not cause others to add more as well.

Excellent call. When I get off work I will examine gox data and I bet you the spectrum will look wonky if we look at the latest ridiculous drop.
I believe insider trading appears in the data as movements which are decisively *not* like the linear oscillator. 
Wall street is a pretty good example.  There is nothing but insider information in these trades...the oscillator appears here and there, but breaks sometimes...the movements deviate a lot from the oscillator model.
Cryptocurrency is still quite unpopulated by big, big fish, and we still do see a lot of ideal oscillating behavior.  The more insider junk there is, the less well behaved the system will be,..

It takes as input a single address and outputs a list of addresss provably controlled by the same party.  It does not list every address controlled by the same party, but there are no false positives.
I control around 180 addresses and it worked for me, when it tested it on myself.  I dont know what it will do for gox, and it may take minutes to run, but I am curious.
We should try to take as input a wallet address "deep" within gox, ya know?
FYI, AFAIK, it will only output addresses which have spent coins.  so there is no way it will be able to know address which gox has sent coins to, which remain unspent.  But it will find the sending addresses, and you can use other tools to calculate all addresses sent to...still you cant prove, AFAIK, that gox controls any coins that sit in addresses which have never spent any.

I mean volatility is responsible for the slippage isnt it? But yes i know what you mean.
Consider another scenario where the drug dealers choose instead to diversity by accumulating BTC in addition to cash.
BTC can't be seized at all so this has some practical application to them.  It might make laundering easier.  It's not always so easy to spend billions in $20's.  
So in a strategy where both cash and bitcoin are accumulated wealth, maybe it can work.  A simple way to see this is that suppose your trade you expected from BTC back to fiat isn't going to be as beneficial as you hoped.  
Then don't make the bad trade, hold BTC.  Why does that work?  Because you werent really going to spend that $1 billion tomorrow. On your next shipment, accumulate more BTC if there is again slippage.  The temporary dips in bitcoin happen, but it seems reasnonable to assume at a later time, you can sell the BTC for what you wanted to get and more.
If I "squint my eyes" - by this I mean not worry about the exact details, and ask myself "can bitcoin work for this guys in some way?"  I'm inclined to say yes it can.  I guess we will have to see.
And I'm still in the camp that slippage can be mitigated.  BTC tx's are pretty fast.

I think that will really go down in congress - it has to, so I'm not too concerned.

Yes, test the value of `getblockcount` against the network-wide largest blockheight (not sure what this is called?).  Im also not sure how to get the network "true" blockheight.  `getblockahininfo` returns it under the key "headers" but I have no idea how reliable this is, or if it works early in the sync. 
If that works well enough for this purpose though, then `./bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo | grep headers | cut -c14-19` does the trick though it seems a bit hackey.

No it's not as simple as that. 
Creating a new pool demands lots if attention. 
Lots of unknown blocks are a nice way to hide hash power, but that can also only go so far until people suspect unknown blocks. 
Silicon is way too cheap to make for this not to be the case. There is more hash power that isn't online with certainty.

Yeah, unless of course, the demand had a drastic affect on the market cap.  And lets be clear.  It would have a be a MASSIVE one.  AT that point, arguably most BTC would be involved in facilitating the mexican drug trade.
And that is my fear in a way.  If this were the case, bitcoin might be crushed by US regulations.  The US govt has been tolerant of BTC so far and I'd hate to lose that trust.

Those two are indeed veterans and add credibility to classic.  And I do trust them fully.  However, they are two guys.  [The core devs are a huge team - just glance at this list]( and tell me you don't know *several* members here as well as you know Jeff and Gavin.
Most importantly, we know how they work together.  Jeff and Gavin are super awesome for offering to help out on an alternative implementation (which I think they should still do, and release classic so we have more software out there). But if we return to the "what if fork" scenario -  we really don't know how well the classic guys will work *together* with jgarzik and gavin.  Cmon.  This is seems clear - they are more of an unknown than what I am used to. Teamwork is hit and miss, and the core devs are a *hit*.
@_date: 2016-03-21 04:20:09
mmmhhmmm. I thought this could be a use case for Bitcoin, and perhaps one we don't really want.
@_date: 2016-03-21 04:46:55
Yeah, but you know, with the amounts of cash they need to convert to BTC, and then back, its not that easy either.  Might as well just leave cash cash.  Thats my guess.
Its discussion like that that make you realize how kinda tiny the market cap still is.  These dudes move billions every hear.  LIke 49.4 billion dollars changing hands.
Bitcoin cannot currently handle this load.  Mind boggling.
@_date: 2016-03-21 06:51:27
This is correct, for the US we usually need banks involved.  But NOT if you do cash tx's and its pretty easy to do with local bitcoins.
Not that they'd use something like localbitcoins, but my point is since were talking dirty cash to dirty BTC deals, they can get around the banks (they have to anyway, even in the current state of affairs - at least to some degree).
Especially if they begin accumulating wealth and holding it in BTC and fiat as needed, this becomes easier to imagine.
I could be way off base and disclosure, I have no formal training in finance.  Im a pysicist and have just been around the crypto world for some time.  I've noticed that when I'm open to holding either BTC or fiat as needed, volatility is less a problem for me.  The limitation to this idea is that my bank can break - if I run out of one kind of money and I need it, I have a problem.
That bankroll problem isnt so for these guys, whose cash flow currently exceeds the market cap of BTC by far. They can comfortably sit in one currency or the other until trades return to advantageous levels.  This mitigates the slippage problem, at least I think it does.
@_date: 2016-03-21 05:38:30
How much business did silk road do?  Does it come close to the 50 billion annually in this drug trade? My guess is no.

I'd have to imagine the BTC transactions for these large sums would be perhaps behind closed doors - the market might have to wait to feel the effect.

This issue is a sticky one. Trump doesn't condone violence. I think his sentiment was that if you support me and you are attacked here because you are with me, I will have your back.  
It's not so evil if you look at us as all just men. What he did was loving to his supports who were feeling discomfort from the high tensions due to the nature of this election cycle. In a way he is saying he's going to take responsibility for what happens here and thank you for coming.
He has genuinely asked everyone to be peaceful many times. But trump is not a typical politician and is not afraid to address the truth - those protesters were violent and Chicago and he addressed it to his supporters to make them feel taken care of.
Honestly I feel it's less in bad faith and more of a man being a man for his supporters. Listen to his words and you'll see what I mean.
By the way I have never even thought of voting for a republican until Donal trump.  He is different, and he has captivated me because he is, in my view, and true and honest man.

This is due to the time it takes to verify, however is it still true [in light of core having merged libsecp256k1?](


merged libsecp256k1, which results in a huge increase in signature
validation performance. Combined with other recent work we're now getting
ConnectTip performance 7x higher in 0.12 than in prior versions. This
has been a long time coming, and without its anticipation and earlier
work such as headers-first I probably would have been arguing for a
block size decrease last year.  This improvement in the state of the
art for widely available production Bitcoin software sets a stage for
some capacity increases while still catching up on our decentralization
deficit. This shifts the bottlenecks off of CPU and more strongly onto
propagation latency and bandwidth.

Granted that this optimization won't do the trick alone. But we can see that this type of optimization, one which is not easy to understand for users, is definitely necessary for scaling in the long term. This is why I feel it is short sighted for the community to fixate on block size alone.

If they did it right they could mitigate the "slipping" as you call it - and I know precisely what you mean.
Since their transaction looks like fiat -&gt; BTC -&gt; fiat, it all depends on how long the volatile BTC stays in that form.  If they can get it to BTC and right back out pretty quickly, they're pretty safe from even the wildest increases and decreases.
If the potential losses are less than the guaranteed taxation, its a go.
I have used this sort of system for a long time.  If you obtain BTC to use it and flip it right after to get fiat again, the volatility is pretty irrelevant.
This is how bitpay works essentially.
Edit: you gotta remember, the drug trade doesnt operate on raxor thin margins.  They margins are high.  So some risk is tolerable as long as the long term behavior averages, which it tends to.  *sigh unless it doesnt*

The code to implement a block size increase is simple nobody denies it. The stress it would put on me as a node operator is very real though.
Lightning network is crazy coding challenge but the burden should be on the devs - not the users and node operators.
I can currently fire up core on my laptop. I think that is an important thing to keep alive as long as we can. 
I mentioned this in a comment moments ago. I was a big blocker until the new EC library came out. It sped up sync from 24 hrs to 4 hrs for me. I appreciate that sort of efficiency.

This issue has these two sides. I understand how you feel too I really do. I really hope what happens is that we can all at least sorta get what we want. Both perspectives are important and neither should be ignored.
If there was no plan for scalability, I'd be worried and would be on the side of big blocks. But since I do trust in the devs ability to implement an absurdly complicated thing, well here I am explaining my point of view.

You want multiple backups in multiple locations so you can lose a few of the backups and still have one somewhere else. e.g. your house and workplace freakishly burn down in the same day.
Additionally depending on your usage you may want to update these backups because the wallet creates new addresses as needed, namely as change addresses. Therefore it is possible that your mature wallet has unspent outputs that older backups do not have the keys to.

Large blocks = lower fees for users, BUT more stress on people who run nodes because many reasons (more bandwidth use, cpu/verifications, bloated mempool, big ass blockchain)
Little blocks = higher fees for users, however network participation is low barrier to entry 
It is argued the former would lead to unacceptable levels of centralization.  
I run core on my laptop. If there were bigger blocks I might not be able to get away with it.
Edit: by the way, running core on the laptop was not possible for me for about a year and a half, until the secp256k1 library was introduced by core devs. I think it was then that I understood their vision and began to embrace a lean mean Bitcoin that runs great on my 2011 dell latitude.

You can both sign messages and verify signatures with Bitcoin core rpc. Use either the debug/console in the GUI version or with the bitcoin-cli if you're running headless.
To get the syntax right just type "help" and look for signmessage.
    verifymessage "bitcoinaddress" "signature" "message"
    signmessage "bitcoinaddress" "message"

This makes no sense. You don't have evidence the number is close to 401765. The number of addresses containing at least a 1BTC input simply has nothing to do with the number of people who own 1BTC or more. 
The default behavior of all the clients I can think of is to use a new address for every change transaction, so people just do control multiple addresses, probably without realizing it most of the time.  Additionally, it's long been a security recommendation to not use an address more than once. 
It is extremely flawed logic to equate the number of addresses containing at least one BTC which the number of humans who control 1BTC.

Indeed, the ~~value~~ **utility** of bitcoin to a certain type of user(s) will decline as blocks fill up.  
For example, users who:
* want to use BTC for brick and mortar transactions
* wan to use the blockchain for sending small amounts over the internet
* want to implement micropayments immediately
* and/or do not hold large amounts of BTC (whatever large may mean to them).  
For that user - it is doubtless there is greater utility in a bitcoin with low transaction fees, and fast confirms for on chain small transactions.
However for users who:
* store "large or significant" amounts of personal wealth in BTC (again whatever large means to that user)
* use the blockchain mainly to move "large or significant" amounts of money once in a while
* use the blockchain as a means of preventing seizure, theft, etc -- this is a HUGE one
* use bitcoin for its irreversibility guaranteed by computational infeasibility
* continue to invest on a regular basis
* have invested in building a business around BTC (a business that doesn't, by its nature, happen to desire the former use case, such as bitpay) 
* have invested in mining equipment
* or many other use cases
This type of user doesn't really worry about blocks filling up right now.  **This type of bitcoin  user is far more interested in the  long term stability and assured continued methodical, emotionless, scientific, conservative, fail safe devlopment of the bitcoin protocol.** For this user, slow and steady wins the race.
**I believe the ultimate long term value of bitcoin, as seen by investors and hodlers, lies in its longevity, its permanence, its stability and resilience, and in also in its people** - bitcoin has truly expert badass scientists.  Those guys are really rockstars.
The first type of user is not totally forgotten.  Its clear to me core devs are certainly going to roll out layers for micropayments, everyday payments, and more than we can really imagine for the future.  This will bring all kinds of users utility.  
Honestly, it comes down to this:  if you don't own much BTC (again, whatever significant money means to you), gambling on a dramatic change is just fine. 
But for those with lots of skin in the game... like investors or miners still paying off investments in infrastructure - I can wait for the day I can buy my coffee with BTC.  The blocks filling up really doesn't bother me nearly as much as the thought of handing over the keys to my BTC to people I don't know, and who do not have a proven track record (and even if you say they do - Gavin and Jeff are veterans, and the other guys are great programmers, etc... the core dev team is a much much *better* option for a conservative.  So, so much better).
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:32:43
One more thought. 
Bitcoin has lots of categories of individuals who use the economy it provides. You got the devs, the node guys who script and whatever (me), you got "big banks" services, miners, exchanges, and THEN you have users of Bitcoin who will want to use at various levels of the protocol. Debit card, vs electrum guy, vs whatever ... It goes on.
Bitcoin is at its best when all can play.
At the heart of this issue is whether we need to expand the cheap tx user base so much right as to push a lot of middle or the road devs, or people who want to learn more, right out of the game.
We didn't want to be left with something like our current financial system where only big shots can even begin to start a business, etc. 
If instead we take our time we may not have to. 
Both perspectives here are putting Bitcoin first. I don't think anyone is being selfish. The difference of opinion isn't surprising considering how differently Alice interacts with Bitcoin compared to Bob... it is no wonder that Alice wants this feature and bob needs that one etc.
See what I mean?

OP: Coinbase is great for buying Bitcoin and you absolutely should use it as a Bitcoin broker. 
I do not think you should use coinbase as a wallet however. Theoretically, because coinbase follows all the regulations and such properly, it should be OK I suppose. But remember that Bitcoin is a big experiment. Coinbase losing all its coins is not something that's ever happened before so I would not guarantee you that everything will be just peachy should that happen.
Many cryptocoin exchanges in the past have suddenly lost all their coins leaving the users out to dry. It could happen to coinbase - then what? That is why I'd advise you to store your bitcoins yourself using some software that is recommended on bitcoin.org.
Of the light-weight clients here, I've only used electrum and multibit. They are dandy, and won't hog your disk.

I talked about Bitcoin a lot years ago when I first discovered it but have chilled out a lot since then.

@_date: 2017-01-03 09:44:52
You should start with a small amount to play with while you're getting used to using Bitcoin.
The best way to store your coins is using software on computers you own and operate. There are options that do not require the 80-100GB of space that Bitcoin core requires. What platform do you want to use? 
Edit: by platform I mean desktop/mobile and which operating system. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:09:14
Perhaps because it is more difficult or somehow less desirable to withdraw fiat from OKCOIN. 
I made that scenario up - I have no idea what the situation is. It is just an example of how such a thing can exist. If it were so easy you have to think everyone would have done it already evening the price.
It would be wise to read up or do some tests yourself with small amounts.
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:01:48
I thought so too until I considered a service like coinbase, which holds bitcoins that are legally owned by other people. This allows one address to contain the legal holdings of several people.
That's not ownership in terms of how we normally talk here in of course but it's ownership in the eyes of the law and probably in the spirit of OPs question. 
Coinbase has a lot of users so that affect could be significant. I have no idea what the numbers are of course.

I agree there are issues making it a difficult think to do. Let me explain my use case to you so that you can understand my desire for such a feature.
I really like breadwallet and want to use it to monitor my mining income.  I set up my miner years ago and have not touched it, nor changed the payto: address is which is locked.  I could change it, but I dont want to.
There are a few other addresses that are especially "trusted" - linked to my coinbase acct, or other platforms.
It would be nice to be able to use these handful of "legacy addresses" - ones that are deeply embedded into the way I use bitcoin, from my phone.
That is all :)
if I were able to add a private key to the keyring in breadwallet, and it warned me **"YOU WONT BE ABLE TO RECOVER THIS KEY WITH THE PHRASE"** I would be fine with that.  Afterall, it was a key generated by another program.  In my case it was bitcoin-core, but if it were say electrum, it would be recoverable from that software, etc.

You would know its safe if you did it yourself:
    addr=$(./bitcoin-cli getnewaddress) &amp;&amp; ./bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey $addr| qrencode -o ~/my_secret_encrypted_spot/$addr.privkey.png &amp;&amp; echo "private key dumped for: "$addr
edit: for anyone who reads this and wants to try it, for this to work obviously you need to be in the directory where the bitcoin-core dist is located, and the directory "~/my_secret_encrypted_spot" should exist.
to make the qr code of a new address just appear on your desktop do:
    addr=$(./bitcoin-cli getnewaddress) &amp;&amp; ./bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey $addr| qrencode -o ~/Desktop/$addr.privkey.png &amp;&amp; echo "private key dumped for: "$addr
or [see this](
@_date: 2015-09-06 04:35:16
So possibly
    bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey "addr" | qrencode -o key.png
edit: ok, this did work.  But then when I scannned the QR with breadwallet, breadwallet prompted me with "send [balance] from this private key to your wallet?"  To which I said no.  I only wanted to import the priv key to make the BTC spendable from breadwallet.  Not to create an transactions.  Not sure how bread wallet works.  So didn't do it.

2) include **K** in breadwallets account making coins sent to **A** spendable by breadwallet?

If you look at the keys corresponding to famous texts hashed once, for example, "To be or not to be," you will find this key has already been used on the blockchain. Sometimes hashed twice they have been used as well.
A private key is a 256 bit number so a SHA256 hash of arbitrary text will certainly generate a private key, but it is not a "safe" private key if others have already guessed it or may guess it in the future.
I would not pick poems or any popular text that can be discovered via trial and error or otherwise to generate your brain wallet.

In terms of math, he invokes a linear approximation to growth.  There is  mathematical reality to the fact that in appropriate time scales, linear approximations are accurate.  The question is appropriate time scale - what means this sorcery?  It's quite simple, and circular; the appropriate scale where a linear approximation is valid is precisely the scale where the "curvature" is small; that is, where the function has no 2nd order or higher derivatives = the definition of a line.
In the case of this chart, well, it's anyones guess whether the approx is valid.  If the growth pattern was exponential, it's probably not valid.  A much deeper analysis is necessary to tell what the average growth really looked like in the apparent flat region.

I would be careful with a discount.  That sort of thing does suggest a favoritism to bitcoin which can appear...ehm *nefarious* to the uninformed and/or basically unconscious consumer who is just going through the motions to get his damned pizza.
I think it would be best to play it cool and accept whatever people want to pay with.
For example, if a local business told me "we take mastercard and discover...with mastercard you get a little discount."  As a consumer just doing my regular daytime buying stuff consumer thing, I'd immediately think "what are you and mastercard up to?"  The knee jerk consumer reaction is not to consider fees...it is unfortunately to assume the worst...when it is a matter of money, ya dig.

Ok I think it goes like this:
bin 600 means a frequency of 600 times per bitcoin lifetime.  The lifetime in this data is 1185 bins, or days.  
This makes sense because that is a frequency of every 2 days.  The nyquist condition would limit my resolution to exactly that because my data set was sampled once per day.  Thus, the highest frequency thing I can see is about 1/(2days).
Do you know where I can get my hands on a more continuous price data set?
Edit: The question arises because mathematica has several definitions for FFT and to be honest even if I looked up in the documentation which is used by Fourier[ I still wouldn't know for sure if I am interpreting this right so: I'm gonna just create some vectors with known frequencies...sample them randomly a couple of ways, and try to consistently extract the information I pre-selected from the same algorithm I used on this bitcoin data so decode it.  
Then I'll post everything somewhere when its all set.

It attempts to identify the length of strong "life cycles" in the BTC price.  E.g. lengths of time, in number of days, that pass between BTC price changes.  E.g. how long will we have to wait until "this price effect" happens again.
There seems to be real periodicity at every: 100 days, 130 days, 180 days, and 235 days.  Those are those 4 humps there.
These are non-trivial periodicities in the BTC price cycle.  In other words, there are 4 root price cycles in the BTC fluctuations.  The hump at every 100 days represents a price swing that occurs again about every 100 days.  The same for the others.
This will not give me information as to which cycle the recent fluctuation belongs to.  Is it the 130 days cycle?  The 235 day cycle?  I guess for that, we'd need to go back to the price data and see if there was a fluctuation 100 days ago, or 130 days ago, or 180...etc.

Its an opinion I have and no more.  A pizzeria owner should do whats best for his business, not whats best for the network.
Hopefully, the two agendas coincide.  I think in general they do.  I still hold that offering a bitcoin discount at a non-tech business like pizza is asking for customer speculation...you just want them to eat the pizza...it's not really good to have your customers thinking too hard.  Pizza Pizza, ya know?
And this feeling of mine is not specific to bitcoin...I think people would speculate over any discount offered for a specific payment method.  I personally do NOT like cash discounts even...and its a knee jerk consumer reaction...It's like I can't control it.  Cash discount I think?  Bastards.  Not much more thought is given, as I equate this to a fee for paying without cash...

Unfortunately, there is still no really good way to keep your bitcoins safe.  It's true.  You have to watch your back with bitcoins.  
I wonder if it would be possible to set a withdrawal rule that, if broken, forwards the coins somewhere pre determined and alerts you. Like "the sum of the digits in any withdrawal is either odd and the second digits is a 7, or begins with a leading 1 followed by a pythagorean triple punctuated with non consecutive primes, like .137455"

As the block reward dwindles in time and the amount of ASIC hardware in circulation increases, there becomes the question of whether dormant hashing power can be collected by a single party and suddenly "turned on" to forge an attack. 
This possibility arises as new generations if miners make older ones energetically obsolete. Where the dormant hashing power goes and whether it is theoretically dangerous is something I am interesting in keeping track of. .

This little echochamber is starting to be destructive.  You may not realize it but when large amounts of money come into play, things can get nasty.  Stop the little coin vs coin battle.  It's illigical, pointless, against the very ideology of bitcoin and crypto itself, and It's not something you can win - this is a strong suggestion from me to you.  This is hurting bitcoins true potential.
Edit: forget it. You will never understand this perrhaps.  I guarantee you, you will lose everything you have for your insane greed.  You're making something about freedom into just the opposite. You want a monopoly, but you're not going to get it.  This isnt a war.  I'm on your side too.  You're making bitcoin a hate club and it's stupid.

The bar graph tells you "volume" of how much bitcoin changed hands in that time interval.  The volume is important.  High volume indicates roughly that some action in the price movement is bound to occur because LOTS of bitcoins are changing hands.
These charts for bitcoins are no different than for other financial products that are traded. Therefore I recommend reading up a bit.  You'll catch on.  In the bitcoin world it is actually somewhat simplified by comparison to the fiat money types of trades, although more complex trading arrangements are being but in place by companies like coinsetter.

Like I said, this is just an automatic knee jerk type thought process.  When higher thinking sets in I identify it as a problem that a business owner unfortunately has to deal with.  
The fact is, while the consumer would expect either the business owner to pass the savings for 0-fee sale onto the consumer, the business owner knows that no matter what pricing sheme is used, the price difference may cause questions and feelings of distrust from customers.
So if I were owning the business, and I didn't have time to data mine to figure out how customers react to price tiers based on how people pay, I'd either split the fees between cash sales and VISA, absorb all the loss, or pass all of the loss onto the customers completely.  All of *those* solutions result in a single price, which I view as necessary, but none of these options are truly fair.
Fair isn't always right for businesses.  Only making more profits is right...which may mean not disclosing every detail of the pricing scheme.
Edit:  I mean you want customers to forget you're trying to make money.  You want them to just enjoy their product, and think no further.  You want them to believe you just LOVE to make the best pizza, and simply enjoy providing excellent service.  There is no profit for the business - you don't remind them there is, anyway.

I don't see Bitcoin causing a reduction in PayPal usage in the short term any more than that of the corresponding reduction in the usage of fiat currency. In the long term, PayPal can adjust and even profit off bitcoin as bitcoin will offer PayPal new conveniences in one way or another.  This is the way bitcoin effects everyone eventually.  There is initially distrust, disbelief, amazement, and finally normalcy, comfort, and convenience - pure benefit.
The issue is of course complicated, but I am of the mind bitcoin will not *really* rock the boat as much as some people think.  Bitcoin will benefit virtually anyone it touches - including financial services.
Really, the more I use Bitcoin, the more I see almost nothing changing for most of the companies and services we know today...except that they, like everyone on earth, will eventually find a way to take advantage of bitcoin and play to its strengths.
Going further, to make a true editorial of it, there is almost no reason to believe, in my estimation, that any financial service today will necessarily suffer because of bitcoin. It is because those companies offer *service*, which is a human to human interaction.  In that sense, it is absurd to think an inanimate *abstraction* such as bitcoin could somehow replace what VISA or *banks themselves* provide for people.  It's service.  
There will be more and more bitcoin services popping up in the future, some of which will be managed well and mature nicely.  Likewise, the old, big players in the financial service industry will certainly not stand by and watch everything crumble.  Their success lies in their ability to make money by offering services to people who want to use money.  They don't require any single type of currency to excel that that.  I think these services will almost certainly figure out bitcoin and do quite well at profiting off it.  
Why *wouldn't* they?  It is the only thing they're good at.  You have to hand it to them!

I generated 1185 outputs, each with a closing price.  This happens when you take a list and input it in mathematica. I then created an indexed table called "price" with ~ 1185 entries.
`price = Table[Out[k], {k,1,1185}]`
`power = Abs[Fourier[price]]^2`
Then you look to see if this looks OK by doing a number of  the following
it should look U shaped.  You have to drop half the entries because of the symmetry (this is the fact that we cannot identify periodicity greater than half the time scale we looked at which is 1185 days so our final plot will have half this many points.
`finaldata= Drop[power,-1185/2]`
Mathematica works out the non-integer number of points you asked it to delete.  It's one advantage of mathematica over MATLAB.
Ok to get some nice looking plots we can do lots of things.  All these commands will make plots and you can decide which view is most useful.  I'll give some attributes too you can use...
For the filtering, you gotta love how easy mathematica is.  I just typed LowpassFilter[finaldata...   and it told me how the syntax worked.  I guessed it had such a function and it does.
`halfweek = LowpassFilter[finaldata,1/3.5]`
`1month = LowpassFilter[finaldata, 1/30]`
You can get a free trial of mathematica.  If you're tenacious you can just make new emails every few months and have mathematica forever.  I bought the software because I love it and thought it was worth the money.  For really quick stuff and curiosity explorations like this was, it unmatched.  It is to Matlab style signal processing what python is to general purpose programming.  It just works for fun stuff and you can almost make up syntax and be fine.  Good luck.

People like you are making mine excellent.  I am a trader, my friend.  Unfortunately it is panic that we love the most. You're certainly not obligated to use price drops in your favor, but I like to do so. Welcome to crypto.

You are insane if you think bitcoin's dominance is threatened by the other coins.  
If you want bitcoin to become extremely valueable, you might want to change your tune. Bitcoin might be the instrument used to buy homes, or companies.  It doesn't need to function as the dollar.  It is an insane obsession you have if you think bitcoin is the one and only.  It is hardly unique, and it on course right now to be valued astronomically high.  
I want my bitcoin to be worth $1 million each.  And that is exactly what will happen if you back down this baseless hatred of the other coins.  You guys need to think about what I am saying.  I promise you from the bottom of my heart, this is a plea to your sensibility that if you want bitcoin to reach the extremely high valuation we all know is possible, accept that bitcoin doesnt need to act like pennies.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:39:33
I don't like this. Newcomers to bitcoin generally have a few misunderstands at first, like that their money is "on coinbase."
We should encourage the practice of installation of full clients for everyone, and always enforce that that safest practice is buying coins on coinbase and taking them somewhere else.  Since the only true safe way to store coins is in personal wallets, we should not even project the illusion of security in this manner. Because I do not store coins anywhere but in my personal wallets, I find 2-factor to be an annoyance where used.  
The idea will certainly not hurt, but I think a better use of our time is to focus on best practices - that is, encourage people to buy bitcoin at coinbase and remove the coins immediately from their wallets.

Here's bitcoin's price on a log scale since 2011 when it began at 5 cents or so. That's 1000% yearly growth (10x value each year), or a doubling time of 3.6 months. 
Before the $200 spike in April I noticed BTC online and read a bit but unfortunately didn't pull the trigger before that spike. However if you uncheck the log scale you'll notice there was a spike like it about 1 year prior to that. 
This is what prompted my fourier analysis.  If you're curious about the [unfiltered spectrum]( there you go...it is filled with noise due to the natural 1 day periodicity intrinsic in the data set.  
However I can see someone wondering about 3 or 4 day periodicity.  Here is the set with a filter parameter of [3.5 days](  
This chart still appears noisy. Its not a surprise however that entire weeks seem to be the natural unit of time for the currency fluctuations.

Yeah...I'm not an econ student, and never was - I can still conclude one cannot deduce this and feel OK about it.
In terms of control theory, which in my opinion is a functional model of reality much more general than physics (and because of that, will suffer in *accuracy* while having the ability to lend insight into a broader realm of phenomena) - in terms of control theory, you cannot make predictions about a time period that is longer than the time period you're using to fuel and ground your prediction - in analogy (and jargonly) the time domain and frequency domain are connected via the fourier transform.
In terms of the graph, you can't believe the line for longer into the future than it extends into the past.
In terms of digital logic, Nyquist.
In terms of math, the best predictor you will get from N samples is an Nth order polynomial, offering a maximal amount of accuracy referred to as Nth order.
In terms of life "This happened yesterday, I bet it'll happen tomorrow" is marginally passable; "this happened yesterday, bet the farm and lock it in for two years" is not always the smartest, and would have a success rate equal to luck.

Why should google treat bitcoin like any other currency?  Bitcoin is unique.  Google is probably still trying to figure out how to treat crypto, like the rest of the world still is.  
Insisting google should pretend bitcoin is USD is pretty weird.  It would be incredibly misleading if they did.  As we all know, bitcoin has properties that no currency prior to it had.

I thought about this as I wrote the title actually.  I went ahead with it because it sounds funny but I determined if I received a packaged laptop in such a case and proceeded to sell it on ebay immediately, the manner in which electronics depreciate with time would hardly matter compared to other sources of loss, like the cost of marketing (eBay fees, etc).
It would be possible to profit from such a technique with clever marketing. I know this trick from personal experience selling used crap on eBay.  Sometimes you can edge out competitors and charge a higher price for an item by pairing it with a stale product that you otherwise could not efficiently sell by itself because of shipping or some other reason.
Edit: In the case that you panic buy 100 laptops and bitcoin loses $150 in price, it is improbable you'd be able to sell of the laptops fast enough to take advantage of market conditions, but you have purchased yourself temporary immunity from bitcoins volatility and locked in the value of your assets.  However you lose the opportunity to use the market conditions to improve your bitcoin position.  You also forfeit your position if the price rises quickly above the crash level.

I think you should take the profits as the value increases.  Hoarding forever is probably not a good strategy, since bitcoin is an asset that can be lost accidentally or stolen from you.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:09:28
I am pretty sure by now bitcoin has enough dominance to avoid this fate. 
It is also de-facto the coin which grew economically naturally.  This has the effect of giving bitcoin the chance of having a fairly even distribution of wealth. The coins coming out now have bag holders waiting to prey on newcomers through the use of social media.  No other coin will ever be "the true experiment."

I have thought about this before.  I think if you casually offer another way for customers to pay, without pushing it, bitcoin users will like it and non bitcoiners will not really notice.
The more popular your business is, the more likely that someone out there is your sworn foe, and would want to use just about anything against you to take you down.  This is always a risk, but these jerks are part of your world no matter what you do.
I say go for it.  Just remember sound business practices, customer is always right, yada yada.  Can't go wrong with that, can you?

(network hasrate) / (difficulty) * constants = 25 BTC / 10 minutes
if the hashrate of the network seems to increase - that is, on average, over 25 BTC were mined per ten min, then the difficulty adjusts to compensate.
The difficulty represents, loosely speaking, the area on a dart board comprising the "you win!" space.  It gets smaller as difficulty rises, reducing the chances of your dart hitting it.  Note also you are throwing darts with a blindfold on.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:32:24

I also obsess over bitcoin.  It is certainly a problem and is changing my life quite a bit.  But it is not out of greed.  I want badly to seize this opportunity to gain wealth because I want to share it with my friends and family.
Is that perhaps what you're feeling?  
Also, you should not attempt to consider a universe wherein you were one of the first miners and are now sitting on 4,567 BTC.  It does not really make sense to do so.  First of all, you are wishing that you had noticed something that you had not.  Then you are wishing that you would have made a series of decisions afterward that you likely would not have made.

I guess - then tell that to many of the services which require 3 to 6 confirmations to confirm a TX.  Confirmations remain an issue of merit for me in my every day life.  Do not downplay the confirmation time difference between litecoin and bitcoin.  I believe it will in fact set the coins apart in the long run and make one coin over the other most appropriate for various use.
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:07:04
I don't think so, not if the cheaper coins can serve the purpose of sending small payments and bitcoin takes on the role of "big money" transactions.  In fact, bitcoins inflexibility with micro payments could help drive the price higher and higher if it is seen as a method only reserved for massive payments.

That's a very good idea.  Boom.
We will surely see in the coming days sellers getting ripped off by lying buyers...I do not blame eBay entirely for siding with buyers as some sellers may be quick to point the finger at ebay... sellers can and should take all possible measures to protect themselves.  
Point is, I think BTC selling on ebay can be done safely if the sellers develop a fraud proof systematic protocol for selling BTC.  So to other ebay sellers and friends of BTC, when the stories of fraudulent buyers emerge, as they will I promise you, be aware of the need to create a systematic and safe way of selling the BTC for the good of both the BTC community as well as ebay/paypal users, including myself.  Think of ideas on how to prevent fraud and spread the word of these techniques.

There is really no explanation that anyone can be sure of for price movements in finance.  That large volume bar indicated that some large amount of bitcoin was traded during that time interval causing the price to shift wildly.  This looks like it was triggered by a gigantic buy driving up the price really quickly. Like a spring, or anything at all really that is suddenly upset from its equilibrium, there is afterward an opposite reaction and subsequent settling back to equilibrium.
People have compared finance charts to random walks and fracticals and all sorts of mathematical objects.  The charts can also be indicative of the human nature to be lead easily when "everyone is doing it!" and be equally indicative of some dark human qualities like natural propensity for greed.  Good luck in your studies.

If that were the case then everyone would do it which drives down the utility of mining, until mining is barely or not even profitable at the pirce for ASICS - one would need to do their own design and be clever.  This is the eventuality.  There is no way economics will allow hardware to simply be bought that profits extremely well.
Think about it.  Right now, the reason mining hardware is profitable to buy is because nobody has any guarantee theyll get it in time.  If we ever found ourselves in a situation where ASICs were readily available and sitting on the shelves, it would be because buying them is a gamble, or simply results in a net monetary loss.

No calculator can be accurate beyond a few proposed increases because it is widely unknown how the new hardware will impact difficulty.
The question is not so simple as to merely add the hashrates of the new hardware shipped into the total network speed and leave other factors, such as participation, constant.  Injection of new technology has many rippling effects, for instance discouraged users, new and old, quitting mining.
