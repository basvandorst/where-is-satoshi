yeah is the mother of all recent inventions totally agree, when i first read white paper back in 09  i was interested :-)  ,   but all these other bullshitcoins  dont cut it ! 
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:15:52
I’ve used them quite a few times before this!   seemed  ok   In hindsight I should of read more reviews

Yes I hold precious metals  my bitcoin  is now probly  10 x the  metals now lol

Just a thought  maybe buy gold on goldmoney.com or other similar places, using bitcoin   then sell gold back to fiat, to your bank account not sure if that would work ?  
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:51:24
bitcoin is the only one thats worth it yep!!!  rest are bullshitcoins 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:24:26
first thing is buy a hardware wallet/ trezor or ledger nano or similar  ,   and maybe start with litecoin with a small amount first  ,  once you understand it more then buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:06:30
Also all the keys are generated on the hardware device  itself ,  so a hacker on your laptop  can’t keylog  or find wallet files etc etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:16:11
yes that was my thoughts  as well   shitcoins 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:44:39
is it possible to point my hardware wallets/ trezor,ledger,keepkey  at my core node running on my computor? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:25:26
vorhuees  bought keepkey  , i dont agree on his stance re supporting b2x,  second  im not sure if he's supporting legacy bitcoin ,  and keepkey maybe pointed to his supporting b2x nodes !   i will move my stash!!  also ive moved lots through shapeshift in the past!!  not anymore,  changerlly is much better !! 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:42:19
either is better than any exchange  don't hesitate just buy one!! ,  i have both  
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:56:39
thanks for the heads up i just fixed the modem to port 8333 etc went to bitcoin.org  followed the info there :-)
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:27:18
ok i have a trezor and a ledger as well thanks ,  if i put the seed into the trezor  what happens to the other coins i have on keepkey ?  eth ltc zcash etc dash  etc?
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:49:13
yes ive used changerlly quiet a bit seems less trouble the shapeshift and theres no limit on order size ,  a much smoother experience :)
