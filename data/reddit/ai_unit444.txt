GDAX is part of coinbase. You can use your coinbase account to log into GDAX and then do the limit orders.

I can definitely understand how stressful a price crash could be but I personally have very little money in BTC so it wouldn't be much of an issue for me. 
Your response does make me much less interested in one though. I don't like the idea of suicide.

Ok, but you're required to spend all of your profit on tattoos. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:36:39
Good luck, my friend. I hope things work out for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:24:25
Where can I practice?

Don't limit buys on GDAX not have transaction fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:00:30
Thank you!

I would hodl until the economy recovers.

hey, sorry to bother you days later but im still a little confused. I have all my purchases and sells logged not but im a little confused as to what the profit/loss* indicator mean. If its profit will it be green and if its a loss will it be red?
Edit: also, i assume net cost* is how much total ive spent purchasing BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:14:56
Had much more to do with him suggesting I use any profit I make in BTC on tattoos than him saying the price will crash.

I got the app but I'm still a little confused. Is the holdings tab where I put in all the information about my purchases? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:50:17
Awesome, thank you so much. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:19:19
Thanks, I'll look into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:22:18
What is a seed?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:45:18
Then I'd say it's not too late. If people are correct, we haven't even scraped the all time high yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:22:04
Do you know where I can find the word list? I thought I wrote those down but I can't seem to find them now. Is there a way to look at them again?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:21:10
What is Sat/B
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:24:42
do you know where i can find them inside the wallet? I just got it so im still trying to figure out all its features. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:27:17
Thank you!!

[this might help](

Congratulations everyone

Do you think this is as high as BTC will ever get? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:39:47
Yeah, Bitcoin, it's all I have. It's not like I'm going to be making thousands of dollars or anything, but I don't like the idea of an IRS audit. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:18:19
This sounds....... fishy

Ohhhhhhh I see it! Thanks. I didn't realize it gives you a dollar estimate when you actually plug in a decimal. You're a life saver. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:35:57
Good point!
