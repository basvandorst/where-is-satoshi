Are you serious?

In a airplane plane, you never come in contact with the outer atmosphere and it hopefully never touches the ground when it should not. But of course, it’s a way to cheat!

What does that mean for IOTAS? It’s basically their value prop, right?

Where dis you get that information from? 
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:49:31

Yes! It's actually an initiative by Bitcoin Suisse AG!

Airport Zurich arrival 1 and 2. Everyone who arrives in Zurich walks through it.

So the only possibility you're gonna loose on that fork is if the value of both the old and the new bitcoin diminish?

How would you assess the risk of staying in during the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:46:37
It’s expected to be the 16th. There’s nothing to finalize, the fork happens when the block comes. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:32:57
You mean running the risk of loosing on potential gains? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:42:41
Jep, think so too.

Sell when it feels best, buy when it feels worst.

Jep, think so too. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:56:43
This is an unusual large sell-off though.

Congrats! Not worried about the upcoming fork?
