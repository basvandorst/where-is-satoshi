Don't trust Gemini much but definitely like that crypto is promoted offline.

And maybe are still waiting for the start of new altcoin season.

Coinbase and bank are very incompatible things. Exchange couldn't even solve simple internal problems.

The art is really cool. There are too many criminals among crypto CEOs.

Nice initiative from users maybe after this they will be heard. And Coinbase will have to change its bad attitude towards users.

The most important is not to change decision in the last moment and start trading.

Coinbase as usually is involved is some shady thing. Seems that this platrform doesn't care about reputation and its users.

Mainstream media, journalists and opinion leaders should better inform people who want to try crypto for the first time. In this case the number of situations described by you will be less. But some people just couldn't be taught cause they see this only as a funny, fast and simple way or opportunity to become very rich.

The situation with colleagues, friends and others as in this meme won't change soon. Many people still even don't want to read about crypto and try to understand it considering it just a big fake.

Very questionable thoughts that Bitfinex has no USD and that they try "to save face". All exchanges had issues like this one at least several times. It's extremely hard to find a place with 100% guarantee of absence of these situations. Moreover some exchanges are being hacked here and there even in recent months so these are bigger problems.

This case is twice positive. Good PR of player and promotion of crypto adoption.
