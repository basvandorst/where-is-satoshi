I would hope that he believes that after just dropping $19 mill or whatever on all those blocks of BTC....

That said lower cost transactions have utility to all so I can see this being implemented sooner than later in Kuwait
Smart idea.

It is possible/ likely that some manipulation of the market happens but this is always short term and the fundamental demand will decide where the price goes
This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the asset's price will be weeks or months from now. In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal, but over the long run this sole group of traders cannot drive price.

The market is not so volatile, as a lot of people think
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:14:51
OMG! how is that possible? what's happened?

Haha ! me too! I like that guy and this comment made my day))

I agree with freedom of speech... It's presenting opinion as fact that I don't agree with. I didn't have to even read the entire article to know that this author needs to increase his crypto currency knowledge base a bit. So I clicked on link and flicked my iPad screen... Stopped here: "Bitcoin doesn’t have very much to offer ordinary users right now." We want mainstream adoption, not people to think this is so complicated that it's reserved for the geeks! That's so circa 2011/12. But I hope you get what I'm saying.

Just don't convert to fiat and you are in the clear either way. Long term that is probably the best return on investment as well if BTC goes "to the moon" as we all predict.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:32:08
No, it is not in interest for buyers. But you are free to put sell orders at $1500 USD, no one force you to sell or spend at $500 USD...

That's why I also lest paypal and now I am using bitcoins )
Finally I 've found the good way to make transactions easier and faster 
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:42:30
So keeping that in mind sooner or later he's gonna be the man that will try to regulate bitcoins and face criticism from the community...!
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:33:51
The price was also stable ! Do you think that we have s period before it is going to grow up again? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:21:50
The banks want 1 thing: bitcoin death.
The banks are so powerfull that they can release any news in the media they want, just in the hope bitcoin will die.
I dont believe a shit about this, because they all are playing under the same roof. For 100% this coin isn't an cia/nsa or any other bullshit company project.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:41:37
I didn't understand it quite clear, what about law in U.S, does it prohibits BTC? or they are not legitimized yet?
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:16:17
A lot of people would never start investing in bitcoin if they didn't have the chance of gaining some money by doing so. Why would just put their money in Jeopardy.

Well, describing Bitcoin as a naturally occurring Ponzi is somewhat interesting, because it actually describes some of its facts and reasons, why bitcoin is successful to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:25:21
such uninformed noobs.. this is not good news. this is like declaring that cows are now rhino's and killing a 'rhino' would now send you to court as rhino's are in the endangered species list that are regulated and need special permissions and licences to kill them, where you have to fill out lots of paperwork as to the reason for the slaughter, etc, etc, etc, etc.
yes there all animals and yes bitcoin / money are all currencies and financial tools. but to declare bitcoin as 'money' is a bad thing.. leave bitcoin as its true description, a free market asset currency.
declaring bitcoin as money is bad. and anyone thinking its good needs to do more research.
as for the charlie shrem incident. at the time of the accused event bitcoin was not money so the law at the time meant that he did not have to treat it as such. his defense should be that its definition was an asset currency which is outside the realms of money transmission. (yet he should be careful because if he touched any FIAT or 'goods-of-value'(assets) known to be involved drug related purchases/crimes. the he would still be on rocky ground)

Sounds like a good idea and a great way to honor him and with Finney being catchy I see it really working out as well. Hopefully something like this will take off and we will see it used a lot more in his honor

They need to some how speed up the confirmation time for non-internet related purchase.
A store with long queue line isn't going to wait for more than than 5 mins for a transaction to complete.

.1 BTC coin. I don't think Casascius has made any that small, but I think Lealana has.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:25:47
Nice (small) milestone, but still a great one. The number definitely has to keep growing now. Apparently there is one in Vienna, but I have no idea how to find it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:43:00
I think at some point those coins will move. I can't see sitting on that much potential wealth and never moving it. I think if and when they do move it would cause a bit of a panic. If they never move then the owner is a better man then I.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:43:27
Looks like a good place to disappear people, guess I'll pass this one.
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:16:22
 Early adopters do profit, yes. This part looks like a Ponzi. But Bitcoin doesn't need any new people to join the system in order to work. That's the key difference form a Ponzi!

This is acceptable but as it says this would scare the US a bit 
The petrodollar is called the petro dollar because it is used as a means of exchange for oil commodities worldwide if the US loses its backing as the premier world oil currency something the Yuan is already doing to Bitcoin it weakens their rate

I am partially satisfied with the Mike[from video]. However some facts were wrong
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:39:34
This is true but some merchants still have fear over their acceptance of BTC.For instance, Bandcamp still prefer paypal payments instead of Bitcoin regardless of the large popularity of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:19:58
That seems too optimistic
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:11:17
Bitcoin is only a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred instantly and securely between any two people in the world. Why could Western Union be interested in it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:53:45
Ohh... I hardly believe that this "turning point" can change anything to people who already lost their money
