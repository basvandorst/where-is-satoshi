then why do ppl want a increase in block size?
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:57:44
i can paypal u money instantly, but with btc i have to wait 10 min to confirm. 
i could send you btc thru coinbase instantly, but then why even use crypto, coinbase is just another bank. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 16:38:16
yes, 100% I agree w/ all the andreas stuff and the alternative to nations w/ gov failure... 
but someday bitcoin will be instant? will it really tho? ...... seems like wishful thinking... I think it might have to be a different coin.

would more capacity now speed up tx times? what r the other benefits of more capacity? 
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:53:16
thanks. how is a lightening tx still BTC, if its never put on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2016-08-28 16:36:14
it's not really if only *insert sarcasm*... the Tx's should be instant. when I submit this comment it's instant. when I make a Tx on my CC it's instant. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:56:17
all my cc, db, paper cash.... are all instant. tradition financial settlement? who cares, my paypal is instant too. way past traditional settlement at this point. chase quickpay is instant. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:35:04
could lightening and fork happen at same time? so your 2 options are fork, or og btc/lightening add on? 
@_date: 2016-08-28 16:42:10
do you think btc tx times can fix themselves? or will it have to be a new coin adopted? 
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:18:10
lightning is separate from a btc fork, correct? separate ideas, separate parties trying to do each? 
lightning is side chain adding to OG btc, fork is new coin with new block size... is that right?
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:08:52


can fork to bigger block size make tx instant?
@_date: 2016-08-28 16:38:57
how will BTC tx's be instant in the not so distant future?
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:01:58


ok, thanks i have to look those up to understand. thank you. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:07:11
is it not too much of an expectation to say a digital cash should be instant?
@_date: 2016-04-28 04:03:25
wow, so gilderna is p2p? 
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:47:00
they are working on making a mobile app, and ability to use in 3rd party apps. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:48:23
when can we buy the bonds?
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:25:54
what do you mean?
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:55:29
Ok can we remove all the butthurt from this conversation. Cause I actually want to understand this. 
When I make a btc transaction, it immediately appears on the blockchain, then confirmed 10 min later... Right after I send it, and it shows up the blockchain, is there anything I could even do to stop it at that point? 
So if I bought a hotdog and the merchant saw the btc transaction up on the blockchain... Isn't that enough?
Like you can't send Bitcoin you don't have? or fake it to show up, then somehow stop it from being confirmed? 
So if btc has unlimited instant appearances on the blockchain, then everything is confirmed no matter what 10 min later... what is the problem?
Does this mean visa = 60k tps and btc = Infiniti tps?
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:51:22
If there was no block size problem. If bitcoin could do 2000 transactions per second like VISA. I'd buy as much as I could buy right now. But the problem is that bitcoin isn't bulletproof yet. It's kinda fucked. 
Everyone is holding their breath. Nothing is for sure with bitcoin until this block size change actually happens... and works. If it goes wrong, it could be the end of BTC.
I can't put trust in BTC now. If BTC is forever be limited to 7 transactions per second. It will be replaced by a new currency/used along side another. 
Then we all hop to an altcoin and go from there. One whose scalability is unlimited from the start. One that doesn't need Gavin to fork it. One that will never need a fork. The idea of cryptocurrency is bulletproof, but the way BTC is now, just isn't. I really hope Gavin can fix it. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:50:00
when can we buy the bonds? /where
counterparty wallet? or omniwallet?
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:10:00
so when will we be able to buy the bonds on counterparty?
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:33:41
Double spend as in send the same amount, to the same address, back to back real quick? 
Wouldn't you need like an electrum wallet to send a payment as zero fee transaction? How do you send a zero fee transaction? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:49:00


You can't buy BTC using USD in mercury. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:01:52
love it. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 05:30:41
it still will. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:49:12
and? 
@_date: 2016-10-30 07:08:05
it doesnt make sense to me either
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:39:17
can you get more than one card?
@_date: 2017-05-02 01:41:06


what does that mean tho ?
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:50:10
i don't think the fear here, is actually the fork, its the fear that some larger private body will gain control over the dominate fork. As if the fork wasn't actually simply decided by the market, but by an influencer, who could essentially control btc from there on out. Is that bitmain ?
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:32:19
bitcoin being ruined. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:03:53
how many regular anonymous cards can I get?
