Don't worry. Lightning network is only a few months away.
The banks and blockstream will save Bitcoin and slay that shitcoin once and for all!

Kinda sad that this bot will literally be sending this notification to an account of someone who's been dead for at least 130 years.

Whatever helps you sleep at night. I'll see you after the crash.

Is the supposed currency of the future only practical for macro transactions? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:54:56
I meant network transaction fees.
Coinbase *shouldn't* make profit off of those. Why make them so high?
I'm okay with paying $0.99 to Coinbase to *get* my bitcoin. Not so much the ~$3 to even *send* the money. That's a Bitcoin problem not a Coinbase problem. 
A similar transaction with Ethereum on Coinbase only cost me mere cents for the transaction fee. Something I'd argue is far more reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:51:30
I suppose. But it won't replace cash. Not like this anyway.
When i buy something that's $3 in a store in a state with 7% sales tax i pay $3.21 regardless whether or not I'm using hard cash or my debit card. 
Wanna do the same with Bitcoin? That'll be $3.21+$2.70 network transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:17:51
I'll stop promoting *working* Bitcoin when the *real* bitcoin starts working. 
I'm not paying $3 per tx. And don't sell me that shit about it "being written forever, its immortal! isn't it worth it?" 
No. It's a fucking text string saved on some assholes computer. I don't give a fuck if someone sees my $30 Papa Johns purchase on the blockchain in 300 years. 
I just want to buy shit without hassle. And a 3 dollar fee just to move my cash is a fucking hassle.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:49:17
Now if they could only offer BCH. 
$3 transaction fee for my $5 month Plus payment? No thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:51:16
The Lightning Network is against everything Bitcoin stands for. It brings in all the disadvantages of fiat and makes the network less secure. 
Why the hell would you centralize a decentralized currency?
LN is a bandaid on a cracking blockchain. Eventually it's gonna burst and the whole thing will come crashing down one way or another.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:57:36
Yeah. I've actually been buying Ethereum and sending that to shapeshift.io and converting it to BCH. 
Way less fees and considerably faster. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:41:53
Idk. I just think a $3 network fee is high. Why would they raise it if it doesn't provide them any money. It all goes to the miners unless coinbase is intentionally raising network fees and having it come back to them somehow. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:48:32
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:10:31
I care about the security. Not that it's written forever. 
BCH is just as secure if not more secure, and it doesn't sacrifice the core concepts of Bitcoin. 
LN will centralize Bitcoin and allow for Banks to stick themselves between users and the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:10:45


Everyone apparently. 
Use Litecoin i guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:26:06


I'm a dude. I prefer Negative Ned. 
And it's not like it will matter anyway, our great grandchildren will probably be eating rodents off the bone in overgrown buildings shooting each other for supplies and territory. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:14:17
Haha, Ministry of Truth shit right there.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:50:05
Yeah, but I'm not paying $10+ USD or waiting 5-48 hrs to use it lmao XD
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:29:05
So, would it be reasonable to come to the conclusion that the other coin i could use it Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:08:00


If only it were that [simple](
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:42:00


We built the ISS and the shuttle because the Nixon administration didn't want to take the risk in conducting Mars missions. The shuttle and the ISS was the cheaper and safer option for Nixon's legacy. 
Had he chose otherwise, we would have likely gone on to continue the great work and progress we made with Apollo and been on Mars before 2000.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:46:26
Last time i checked my Coffee Shop and Purse.io wanted Bitcoin, not Litecoin.
If i have to convince them to use another coin instead because it's cheaper, why not Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:16:42
Yep, and people are too busy fighting clean energy solutions so they can keep their oil baron money. 
Governments too busy building tanks to build rockets, and too busy paying social security to fund research and development for sustaining life on Earth or cheaper and affordable space colonization.
We're going to get caught in the great filter not for a lack of ability, but lack of willingness.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:14:34
Yes, we had man on the moon within one lifetime of powered flight, because there was incentive.
Incentive to beat the Soviets to the moon, incentive to rain bullets and bombs from the sky during the world wars etc.
What incentive is there for a peaceful habitation of the moon,   or even colonization? Same goes for Mars.
We cannot advance our progress into space without incentives. Space on it's own provides no incentives to the people of Earth, but it holds many for people who desire to leave Earth.
I'm not shortsighted, merely painting a visualization of what will occur if we don't do anything to change our present course.

I don't have 12k to make 12k transfers.
Is Bitcoin not for me?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:13:47
I'm also just gonna leave [this]( here...
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:42:04
So, what's the point of buying land on the moon if your literally never going to go there, and if you do who's to say your entitled to that land anyway?
Good chance Elon or anyone else with the cash to go there or literally do anything there will use your "moon deed" as toilet paper. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:53:10
Honestly with all the infighting, volatility and other factors make Bitcoin and virtually every crypto being unstable I'm thinking decades and a new mainstream currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:07:29
Either way everyone is dead lmao.
The great filter is approaching.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:06:40
I mean, if your alive by 2060 or later. Go for it.
The world is more likely to end than we are to have a space age this century. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:44:00
If your fees are greater than the mining award, there's something wrong.
Trying to tout high fees as a good thing is straight outta 1984.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:36:44
Eh. It's very hit or miss. Supposed to reduce blocks to 10 minutes regardless of hashpower, still getting blocks 1-2 hours apart at times. 
Although it's important to remember it calculates the difficulty based on the past 100+ blocks, and BCH lost 3 EH/s hashpower (about 90%) last night. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:45:28
Funny, I remember making this more than 3 weeks ago.
Let's just say I've said things on older accounts I wasn't proud of. Got a clean slate.
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:39:06
Yet Coinbase wants $5+ USD to move $10 RIP.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:47:22
Do i have to re-verify for GDAX?
I thought the process for Coinbase was painful, please tell me i don't have to do it again :(
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:45:31
Hmm, I'll give that a try.
May i ask why they make it this way? Wouldn't they catch on to people using GDAX to move without fees or is this what they intended for us to do?
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:39:44
I bought them there.
Do i deserve to be shit on because I use coinbase?
Sorry, I don't particularly feel I should be forced to pay a 5 dollar network fee because I bought instantly with a debit card.
Coinbase makes no profit from network fees. So you can get of your high horse about making this some deserved punishment for using coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:21:48
That's great for people who are spending millions at a time.
Not so much for my $10-60 game purchase. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:25:50
Because it costs me $5 to move it out of coinbase to that wallet in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:58:13


I too would like to know if there is any caveats to this.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:32:47
To use Bitcoin with the same ease of use as fiat currency, that's the price we're having to pay.
Bitcoin purchases easily cost me almost 10 dollars more than fiat counterparts such as debit card or PayPal.
Gotta decide. Rich schmuck settlement layer bullshit or currency of the future for the common folk.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:03:58
That allowed instant purchase with debit card in my country and state I live in with low fees...
