So you disagree with taxes altogether?  I think most people agree that some taxes should be payed so that we can pay for things like roads...

This is a good point, thanks. It is more secure money for the little guy.  I still worry what the big guy will be able to do with a completely untraceble curtain, though.

It is good that we still have those laws.  I guess they could use loopholes with US dollars now, but it would still be harder to trace with bitcoins (even if something isn't illegal the press or wikileaks can help shed light on it).
Oh, I am definitely influenced by advertising as well.  Get out of my head!
I believe in personal liberty and everybody's right to make decisions, but we as a society also agree to limit certain rights.  I think one of those limits in a healthy society should be that someone with a ton of money can't buy air-time on my TV to try and trick me to vote certain ways.

Bitcoins are a different weapon, though.

Yes, I agree that Bitcoin is here and glad that it is.
I was just trying to gauge people's opinion if they see any bad in it.  I am always telling my friends how awesome btc is and everybody here just talks about the good side.
I see a possible bad side and, haha, was honestly hoping somebody would say "oh no that wouldn't work because of X, so bitcoins are still perfect!"

I guess because you can do some pretty bad things with a lot of money (as I mentioned above).  For more working-class people, the things that they may want to spend money privately on are really personal things.  Once you start to amass a fortune, you can influence the world in some pretty bad ways.
Influence is one of my greatest concerns.  In the USA, super-rich people like the Koch brothers are able to literally buy legislation.  It could get pretty scary if there was absolutely no way to tell who is funding our politicians.

You're right on the use of 'litereally' -- I had actually type 'almost' before it but decided to delete it to drive my point a little harder.


For some politicians I think it is much simpler than this.  Their opinion is changed very easily based off of how much money you give them.  Their 'personal responsibility' for making good choices doesn't look to be working out too well.
The electorate does vote for who they want to win, but the electorate is terribly suggestible to the influence of ad campaigns.  You say that they must be allowed to make their own decisions, and I agree, but I think that the ability to buy much more air-time than the other guys should not be the deciding factor in that decision.
I guess this specific argument ultimately comes down to money in a representative democracy rather than Bitcoins in a RD. But with Citizens United and the decision to allow more money in, Bitcoins could be a dangerous way to influence things.

I worry that my government is devaluing our currency and would like to have a separate currency not under US control, but still believe people that have the means should pay taxes in a modern society.

That's what I meant by different.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:04:37
That's not what I'm saying -- it is definitely a complex issue and I was looking to start a discussion and hear some enlightening perspectives.  I generally am in favor of Bitcoin but also worry that the ultra-rich can turn into the coercive institutions like goverments that we are trying to separate our money from in the first place.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:08:32
It is really easy to just not do that though.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:06:02
I agree with most of your points and think it is worth it. I just wanted to see if anybody would admit that there are bad sides to this great thing we call bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:37:24
No but people never mention the bashing in the skull in this subreddit, it should be acknowledged.

We have government agencies with the sole purpose of keeping track of people funds -- they are getting better at keeping track of foreign account in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands with increasing globalization.  Bitcoin can serve as a new, untraceable Switzerland.
