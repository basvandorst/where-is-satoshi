higher price makes it easier to build new infrastructure though.

i think everything you need to know is on the wiki, whitepaper, mailing list, bitcointalk and reddit.
i think books on bitcoin are vaporware right now, but then again i think most (non-belletristic) books are vaporware.
you can search for "bitcoin book", it gives you a few results.
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:21:44
you're right, if you live in some country with no/corrupt police then this might indeed undermine confidence in bitcoin ATMs in those areas.
but it will also undermine faith in fiat ATMs in those areas so it's not a problem.

if it's in your hand it means it can get stolen because it has a set location in the time-space continuum.
things like multi-sig escrow are impossible with gold too.
you can't trade gold without meeting the other person at a centralized location unless you send it by mail which is risky.
gold isn't as centralized as fiat but not as decentralized as bitcoin.
it's like the upgrade from letters to emails and it will allow for things you can't even imagine.
viagra spam, 419 scams and malware are just some of the things that were previously possible!
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:34:50
so if you don't want haters to disrupt your discussions this makes you a cult?
lol i wish all haters were that bad at trolling.
unless you were being sarcastic ofc, then please excuse my downvote.
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:03:20
it's written in the whitepaper or mailing list :p

i hope you lost bigtime for falling for such ridiculously stupid FUD :D

(no idea how well it works and I'm sure there will be issues but i like the general idea)
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:48:44
fyi they're in [this thread right here right now.](
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:52:26
imho contrary to popular belief valid criticisms are usually quite welcome.
after all, if bitcoin fails due to some unresolved shortcoming we'll all lose money.
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:36:41
yeah seems to be controlled by the american version of the bigoted conservative religious engineers who make up a huge part of taliban terrorists.
but i think the vote campaign was launched by some bank(s) because that's what happened last time someone posted a similar thread showing advantages of btc over banks.
if you post something about banks here the top comments will be complete shit and have so many replies that you won't be able to see any real comment.
if you mention this thing you get dozens of downvotes within a short time.
i wouldn't be surprised if in a few hours the top comments here will be about flowers, dogecoin and ww3.

ok, well then sidechains are not like HTTP. happy?

Don't be so serious guys, this is funny.

i thought 51% attacks on PoS are much easier than on PoW?
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:12:57
nice but why do you downvote me instead of accepting my offer?
**how do you think a 51% attack will destroy bitcoin?**
and if you post a link instead of an answer again I'll post a link instead of an answer too.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:20:16


i think you underestimate how fast bitcoin is developing.
there is an increasing number of programmer all around the world working on new features 24/7, and sidechains are a massive advantage.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:51:27
yeah. I was just thinking about the "NSA will spend billions to sustain a 51% attack that blocks all bitcoin transactions for months" FUD that is going around at the moment.
it's obviously a stupid idea to do such a thing because even if bitcoin died people would switch to altcoins so the NSA wouldn't gain anything, but it can't hurt to have plans for worst case scenarios.

next month on every airport in the US:
"our records show you like bitcoin. we need to search your bag for dangerous chains."
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:50:01
is there a specific reason merge mining must be used? or is that just for the bitcoin block rewards so sidechain miners have an incentive to mine other than transaction fees?
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:24:56
spreading paper wallets with instructions on them was done a lot in the past and I'm sure some restaurant employees and pizza delivery guys were fucking happy to have accepted them.
this gets people interested and when prices rise they'll be bragging to their friends about their free money.
we could try this again, but now that we all agree that bitcoin is more than just play money it's probably harder to overcome our personal greed.
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:41:35
isn't that the kind of thing you can use open-transactions for?
or am i overestimating them?
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:16:28
when you own a piece of gold that piece of gold is in your hand.
bitcoins are nowhere, there's just a list of transaction which exists all over the world.
you don't need a permission to start mining either.
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:49:18
they might just be heavily invested in metals and lack the motivation or education to be able to move into bitcoin so instead they're doing the best they can to make it fail: post bullshit on reddit.
however some of them do indeed possess technical knowledge, even though their pathetic fallacies make them look like fools.
maybe it's a bit of everything, it doesn't have to be one organized group attacking us, it can be several groups too -.-'
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:38:38
but luckily the internet is upgradeable and all websites (bitcoin private keys) still work :)
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:31:13
Question: 
In case of a serious 51% attack,
could all bitcoiners just decide to switch to a scrypt (or whatever) sidechain and carry on happily while some Bank/WU/NSA/PBOC operator has to explain to his boss why he just wasted loads of money for a stash of useless ASICs?
once the attack stops and enough time has passed to assume that &lt;attacker&gt; sold his mining gear people can move back to sha-256.
miners would obviously take a massive hit but the economy could continue just fine.
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:20:33
stop talking bullshit. someone with 75% can't do more than someone with 51%, he just succeeds more often.
it wouldn't destroy bitcoin though. troll elsewhere.
if you *seriously* think a 99% attack can destroy bitcoin please tell me how you think it will do it and I'll tell you why you are wrong.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:47:04
ok. then it wouldn't be a real sidechain but in theory we could still use pegging to convert bitcoin to a coin that uses a different algorithm and convert back to bitcoin at a later point.
but thinking about it it would probably be easier if we just abandon sha256 altogether in such a case by changing a switch in the config.
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:45:39
gwern.net has resources about various darknet drama if you're into that.
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:44:49
he knows what he is talking about. nobodybelievesyou is one of the trolls downvoting pro- and upvoting anti bitcoin stuff 24/7 because he's working for one of them or batshit insane.
look through his history.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:58:51
how am i wrong please? and thanks for the downvote. wtf.
instead of being an arrogant prick maybe post a real answer?
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:41:16
[lol as if any reddit admin gave a fuck about things like that]( they're probably getting paid well to behave like those three monkeys.

i love bitcoin but the byzantine general thing is a myth i think. bitcoin did not *entirely* solve it, it only found a nice new solution to *reduce* the risk of failure.
i spent some time thinking about it and reading the wikipedia article and i think satoshi's answer missed the point.
the thing is that in bitcoin you can't know if every other party received the blocks you mined.
imagine you decide to (in satoshi's example) start the attack on the enemy's wlan if 100 blocks get mined in a certain time.
one node might have only received 99 blocks before losing connection, and you'd have no way of knowing if it only received 99 or received the 100th block.
therefore you might start the attack with one general missing, resulting in failure.
look at the examples on wikipedia.
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:53:25
wow, i totally missed that page. thanks, will read.
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:46:55
no, it is nitpicking which is a subset of trolling.
presidente's comparison to a religion was bad but unless you're a braindead asspie fucker you should be able to understand the metaphor without selectively picking out the flaw in it.
stop this shit and get a life.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:19:48
yeah sure, 25%. duh.
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:07:20
ok sorry then. must have been one of the trolls. it's just weird because no one else had any downvotes.
anyway, now that we are over that why don't you just paraphrase your video so i can explain to you why you are wrong?
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:44:01
plot twist: it's actually the haters who are circlejerking and making up their own reality.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:27:56
i lol'd too, but don't fall for his fallacies, he's a known troll.
the difference is that with cryptocurrencies you don't need more than one
because there are no imaginary lines separating arbitrary patches of land.
