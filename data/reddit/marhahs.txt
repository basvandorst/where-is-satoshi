Fast because the third wave in elliot is always like that. The fourth wave will be killing.

There are many reasons. Some said above and some said elsewhere. One reason however is this: bitcoin (in fact its concept) will be the base for measuring wealth in future. The day after that last block is mined, bitcoin will not be bought or sold anymore, rather it will only be traded. The same way that GOLD was for the better part of the past history.
There are some other reasons too. Some very fundamental and some technical (based on Elliot Wave theory).

I guess the move from fiat to crypto is still in pre-investment phase. The circulation of crypto is the critical moment for a cryoto economy.

I am thinking about 3500$ and guess what. For that we need a good double bottom or ascending triangle. That's all is happening in my opinion.

So, after one day the price is 10% up and no one is interested in asking why? Amazing how people react.

What you wrote is literally true: few days ago US government and the president himself stated explicitly that Qatar has sponsored terrorism and because of this they fully support Saudi blockage on Qatar. Today 15 June the US government signed a 12B $ arms deal with Qatar. Yes.

The politicians just recognized that they have missed the opportunity. They want their share of crypto market. Hence the bill. But this time is different. They did the same with land, metal (gold, silver, Platinum), oil. This time is different. Hold your coin my friends. HODOR. Please hold. Please. Think of your future. Your kids or beloved ones after you. Please hold.

Children cry while whales eat. Not only BTC but also alt-s are doing just normal correction. When btc goes 20% up in a day they dont ask why but when it goes 15% down they think we are in apocalyptic future.
