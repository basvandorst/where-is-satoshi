Happy ‪
I'm hoping you might celebrate Giving Tuesday with a contribution to an organization that you care about!
I'm helping to fundraise for the organizations below, and I'd love if you could donate whatever you have to spare. Or, if these organizations aren't your cup of tea, I hope you'll donate today to another nonprofit that you care about.
Dream Defenders builds on the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., developing the next generation of young leaders and organizers fighting for justice. Directed by black and brown youth, they train and organize youth and students in nonviolent civil disobedience, civic engagement, and direct action. ‪ ‪ 
Free Press fights for your rights to connect and communicate by holding the FCC and big corporations accountable. Free Press is a leader in the fight to protect Net Neutrality — the principle that keeps cable and phone companies from controlling our speech, art, music and commerce online. 
Gulf Restoration Network works to ensure a healthy Gulf for generations to come by fighting to protect and restore the natural resources of New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana loses a football field of land every hour from it’s coast, which is a huge problem for our nation. If this were happening in New York, Central Park would be gone in a month and Manhattan would disappear entirely after a year and a half. 
Little Kids Rock restores and revitalizes music education in disadvantaged public schools across the United States. Just a $25 donation to Little Kids Rock provides one inner city public school student with an entire year of music lessons rooted in the popular music genres that they know and love. 
I am continually inspired by the important work of these organizations, and hope you are too. I'm asking you to take a few minutes out of your day (and a few dollars out of your pocket) to donate to any nonprofit organization doing work that you believe in.
