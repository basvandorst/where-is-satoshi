Mmmm that is what I am looking for. I didn't consider that. And that is definitely a real possibility and one that could easily happen

Good point. Both reasonable threats. 
Just to reiterate I posted this in hopes that I do get convinced enough to move it. So I'd rather you guys be able to prove me wrong then not

So are you saying that my coins are equally as safe at gemini as my money is at Bank of America? I get that I am giving the bank my money and only getting a promise that they will give me it back when I ask. But I would consider the risk that they won't give it back is extremely low. Low enough that it is probably less of a risk to have it there then to have all of my saving in cash in my mattress

I am having the same reaction to the bank comparison. People saying it's comparably safe to my money being at Bank of America is amazingly reassuring. I don't keep ALL of my savings in a bank, because, well, government. But realistically I feel like money in a bank is safer then in my floorboard. The odds of my house burning down is greater then the bank outright stealing my money

That's freaking heartbreaking knowing today's prices

That is a good point. Hindsight is always 2020. However, were any of those exchanges operated in the United States under government license and regulation, run by well known trusted individuals (such as the Wink twins)?  I was not around for any of those exchanges so I really don't know the answer to that. I only finally purchased my first coins a few months ago. I guess what I am wondering is are any of those exchanges that have folded **actually** comparable to one such as gemini?

I didn't know about exchanges being likely to crash in event of something happening that I would want to liquidate. That's a really good point tho. I can Google around but if by chance you have any site you trust that has instructions for dummies on creating a paper wallet if u don't mind linking me I would appreciate it
