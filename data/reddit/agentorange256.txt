I mean, its a store of value and not a currency. ETFs make more sense in todays climate.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:21:13
how the fuck you using your ira money for crypto? da fuk?
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:13:00
buy dogecoin and tell them to convert 
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:10:47
I laughed, but just no..
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:31:17
I feel like “western countries” with low populations have it good in that regard. Like 80% of the US is fucking woods and desert. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:35:23
But the smaller the land mass the less required for infrastructure. I don’t know what I’m talking about. Just drinking and making random rationalizations. What time is it there. 
/e. Yes our money is 60% fucking military. And with our new “space force” (star trek?) it’s going to go higher. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:04:23
Hahah I feels. Unfortunately in my area, you’re still using coal power to charge your shit. A little further north and it would be hydro and nuke. But it’s all coal round these parts. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:08:42
not possible
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:28:20
No shit. No one cares anymore. Grandma and grandpa don’t give a shit about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:53:36
Well since you’re in the future, what picks should I go for stocks tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:26:30
I don’t even have fiber and I live in a town with a top US public university. Fuck me. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:27:35
Don’t take random redditors advice. Do some research and learn which projects you care about 
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:14:04
Oh, you're right. Space travel will make things cheaper than they are now.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:08:51
Nothing, just disagreements in protocol and use case.

ATMs/machines usually have much higher exchange rates.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:58:35
Sounds like coinbase 
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:48:20
You literally could not have done a bit of research if this is as far as you've gotten. If this process is already frustrating you probably should be somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:12:33
Well, I must say that it is not always indicative 100% of the time as a disclaimer. But those that say history =/= future dont realize that this is actually one of the best predictors in a lot of things. Maybe not economics all the time but still.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:10:01
No, not really. Thats my point.
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:45:24
the in-store purchase has got to be the most expensive possible route
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:27:54
In fact, past performance and trends are the best predictors of the future. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:06:07
Ya, this is not adoption....More "investing". Come one man read through the lines.
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:06:44

More buyers than sellers

He is the top LE official in the US. Regardless of ones opinions. I personally don’t agree with his priorities, but that shouldn’t take from the accomplishment of making the appointment 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:37:38
That area is generally called Lower Alabama 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:36:13
pokemon already had a huge following, and they had phones. So it shouldnt even be in there.
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:39:37

I mean everyone saying its going to mars, no one saying its ever headed back to the Earths core.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:18:30

Lol fucking Director of NSA and US Cyber Command - Auburn Graduate

Bama not all bad :P
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:55:50
theyve been having issues all week long with many users
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:22:52
im looking into litecoin myself. Eth hit high at the same time as BTC so maybe lite will do the same
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:55:42
if we knew the answer we'd be doing it for ourselves
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:16:00
buy more for use and make it go back up
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:10:16
can you use it on mars?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:08:52
ive noticed that all markets have a slightly different showing/selling price.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:46:38
I heard coinbase is nice, good customer service
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:31:40
I think they have released many statements about this already claiming that tokens will be safe
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:33:25
sounds like youre and unlucky guy
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:52:26
pretty smart guy

@_date: 2017-06-28 01:46:32
send to gdax first, then send from gdax. lower fees
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:41:09
Two wrongs or some shit like that 
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:33:30
just btc --&gt; ether  then eth --&gt; new exchange   eth --&gt; btc
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:19:52
you should have an address on your gemini account that links to that wallet. Simply copy and paste that into your send line in coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:59:07
keep them in coinbase, they gotchya :P
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:53:44
create an electrum bitcoin wallet and I can send you btc vs usd
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:04:03
the problem with constantly moving your coins is the fee's will eat you alive. Most tell you not to store your coin on website exchanges such as coinbase because they could go bye bye if the site goes down or they "misplace" your coins.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:06:46
coinbase/gdax does the same thing.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:33:03
coinbase app can be setup to notify you at certain prices
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:35:44
use gdax if you have an issue, oh wait, its the same
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:17:19
I simply use an excel spread sheet which holds my initial investment against my current portfolio
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:47:21
Nice for selling doe

Bitcoin ATM 
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:47:11
It seems like you have figured it out already. Coinbase/gemini are your only hope
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:39:36
Why are they selling?
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:37:48
If the address doesnt work it may bounce back? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:55:58
thats a bit severe sir
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:04:03
hacked for sure
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:48:40
its safest to buy them on either and transfer them to a personal wallet like electrum
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:32:36
yes, it is too late to really get into the bitcoin mining game. However, you can mine other altcoin and possibly make a profit.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:06:19
and much faster/convenient than fiat --&gt; fiat
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:33:39
shhhhhhhhhh dont say that
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:29:48
don't use your shit for illegal purposes and pay your taxes
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:18:30
ill sell you bitcoin at a higher expense if you want. Itll cost you now but youll gain in the future
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:46:19
This is currently one of the major problems. This really isnt that possible at the moment. Unless you know someone willing to send it to you from their personal wallets for USD. Most exchanges have rather small limits
OR, bring 1 mill cash to atm's and start putting that shit in the slot lmao
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:05:32
as long as you have the seed saved you can always recover your wallet
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:23:08
I do! But I also get cracked out watching crypto-graphs all day haha.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:18:23
ive been watching. Its so cheap right now even if it hits $1 it would be a good investment. Might dump $100 into it
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:58:52
I think he is saying they are not charging him for the transfer between the two? I don't see how though
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:48:08
Its cheaper and isn't tied to the chaos that bitcoin currently is. Has the potential to allow more profit due to its currently low price. People estimate it will jump into the hundreds as well, although its currently only at $33. It is also developed with higher standards.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:27:54
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:48:03
i hope that isnt the case haha. I really dont understand why all cryptos are down though. Turmoil in btc should create gains else where. not like people have given up on the thought of cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:14:11
you think we're magically fucking genies?
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:25:14
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:58:20
Your problems are when you cash back out to fiat
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:22:22
they have sent out a message regarding this issue. I have read it multiple times. Im sure its on their user friendly website somewhere
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:30:56
tell me about it. I'd rather it be a nice and stead daily % raise like stocks. I would be much more willing to invest heavily
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:35:12
seems simple, go the way that makes people money
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:59:38
sounds like price manipulation
