Well, as far was we know, there is no algorithm to solve for a private key from a public generated with ECDSA.  They only known method is brute-forcing it, or some other intrusion method.
In this sense, you can "steal it using math" the same way I can "make gold using math." That is, setting up a function (like alpha decay in lead, or private key generation) and waiting an unrealistic amount of time.
What I'm trying to say it, its so close to impossible, that its not worth discussing.  If at any point it becomes possible, or its apparent possibly is come into question, we may need to revisit the discussion.

Why would NewEgg scam customers? They are a reliable retailer.

I don't get this argument. Just because your right, doesn't mean he is wrong.

Assuming they are following the rules.  Which is cute.  Here's the cold truth: if you ever put your card number on a website, convince yourself you are now not the only one with it, and the ability to use it.  Keep an eye on your bank/credit statements.

Then you wouldn't need to buy their business class service.

On paper, using a pen that sucks the blood from your veins as ink.  Also, if you don't already know the fundamental calculus needed for the algorithms, your forced to sit through a course on them, taught by naked, balding, middle-age man who hates his job, and doesn't really care if you learn it or not.

I think your missing the point of the tech. Its not about anonymity, it about possession of digital currency.  It allows you to control cryptographicly secured digital currency, that (minus a force of some kind, like you would need for cash anyway) can't be taken from you.  They government can't seize your coins.
Its is a potential problem with blacklists, which the community is currently against, and seeking solutions to.

Woosh.  
He was talking about the woman's crimes, not the person who stoned her.  He is saying there is nothing that woman could have done to deserve being stoned to death. Period.

Congratulations, you know how to make a strawman.
A firearm only has one purpose, to kill, and firing on in public is akin to attempted harm.
Driving a vehicle, while very effective at delivering lethal force to a human body, its not it's I intended purpose, unless your driving into a group of people.
Its about the intent, not the action.  That is until someone is harmed, then it is about what harm the action caused.

Well, just cause they had the time to, doesn't mean they did.
@_date: 2015-03-28 08:57:08
Okay, so what if they did?  It doesn't change how the protocol work, or how cryptography works.

You mean like you just did?  You're the only one making assumptions here.
