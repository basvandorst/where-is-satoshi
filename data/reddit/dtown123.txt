First of all, not everybody uses US dollars.  While I'm as excited as anybody that the value of bitcoin is going up, the $1000 milestone is only important to a small number of actual bitcoin users.
Secondly, mBTC is shortsighted.  Less than a year ago, bitcoin was worth 100x less than it is today.  If bitcoin has another year like this, mBTC will be considered "too large to digest" and we'll be having this discussion again, adding to the confusion.
Either switch to sats or lets just keep going like this.

Sounds like a sausage party

I'm with this guy.  I think it's funny how the intent of milli/micro is to make bitcoin easier to digest but in reality it just makes things more confusing.  I can assure you average people understand more than two decimal places much easier than the difference between micro and milli.
Straight to sats or do nothing.

It looks like 0.19BTC to me.  Am I missing something?

You might want to take a deeper look in iOS.  I just found my wallet.aes.json sitting in /private/var/mobile/Documents.  Deleting immediately.
EDIT: I should note that removing the app did NOT remove the wallet.aes.json file.  I really feel like burning this phone now.

Thankfully they are still honoring original commitments.  
With that said, it makes selling your preorder a lot more tempting since it's now more than doubled in value.

Oddly enough, I arrived at Nigeria via a different method.
* M - 13th character
* E - 5th character
* Convert to text and you get: Thirteen Five
* Number of letters in each: 8, 5
* Convert to lat/long: also puts you in Nigeria.
Well done.  Sorry you didn't win.

Probably Avalon "burn in testing"

mBTC is a waste of time.  Straight to satoshis.

The Single PCB has been redesigned and is slightly bigger.  The Single aluminum case had to be redesigned to accommodate the larger PCB.  A BFL employee has stated the new Single case is roughly 20cm X 11cm, so it's also likely (not confirmed) that the new case will also contain an internal power supply due to the higher-than-expected power requirements.

I think you are getting this place mixed up with their official forum post.

This is good advice.  
Also, if you have multiple computers with iTunes (for example, your work computer) and you have ever connected your iPhone to it, you may have done a phone backup to the computer.  There's a slight chance your wallet.dat could be buried in the old backup.  Try to think of any computer you have ever synced with recently.

I had never heard of flattr before this.  What a cool idea!  Bitcoin would compliment the service nicely.

My first actual bitcoin purchase!  The entire transaction was smooth and took about 45 minutes before I was eating.

Many businesses that accept bitcoin use services that convert to their local currency on the fly, so the current value of bitcoin shouldn't be a concern to them.

I know plenty of college kids with no cash and a good sized BTC wallet.  Would you rather have ramen for every meal or Jimmy John's?

I recommend you buy something tangible when you can afford it - bitcoins didn't feel "real" to me until I did that.  I bought pizza and I felt like I was cheating the system.

I thought the whole point of mBTC was because of dumb people.
