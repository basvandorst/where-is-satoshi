25k would be a disappointment. And somehow I think we still won't reach it. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:09:33
It won't. Remind yourself or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:19:26
Here's what happened. The thing went viral. Just like that funny video, last year, or that crying Jordan meme the year before. That's the ONLY reason it exploded in value. The money that poured into it did so, not because of the technology, but because the price was going up, up, up. That's it. That kind of growth is sustainable for so long. There's only so much extra money people can part with. The viral buzz is gone and soon bitcoin will be forgotten about by all those people. We've already seen the correction, but now, no one knows what will happen next. Exponential growth is no longer a possibility. Not in the near term. So HODL or whatever, or move on to something growing faster if your goal is to make money. If you're in it for the tech, then you needn't be discussing price.

Go back to posts in this sub in like 2013. It absolutely was originally meant to be anonymous and decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:44:38
This sub isn't much better. No crypto sub is. You guys are all crazy. It's difficult to sort fact from fiction for someone that's pretty neutral. For instance, you guys have been excepting bcash to become worthless, and it just hasn't happened. And they keep thinking  bcash will replace bitcoin. Which also, is not happening.

$23 average transaction fee, and who knows how much time for confirmation if it happens at all. 
Yeah.. *banks* are the corrupt ones. Okay. If you want to replace banks, or anything in existence for that matter, you have to provide a better solution. Right now, we don't have that, and bitcoin is not undervalued in any sense of the word. You are living in a fairy tale delusion if you believe that for one second. It is a textbook speculative bubble in its current state simply because 90% of the money flowing into it currently doesn't even understand what it is or what it was meant to be. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:20:46
As someone who's been watching since bcash's conception, continuing to see comments like this is both alarming and hilarious. Bcash is not going anywhere. To continue to make delusional speculative comments eluding to such is pointless, and it does a number on my belief in cryptocurrency as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:20:09
No, no.. He's totally using bitcoin. I am too. I've gone completely crypto. When I want to buy something, I simply exchange a bit of BTC for USD and then transfer it to my bank and then use their debit card. Literally every place I shop takes BTC now because of this.

Today..in 2017, that's maybe 10% of the people that own it. The vast majority of owners want to grow their fiat with it and that's it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:56:55


You and about half a million people per day. This is a company that is being faced with exponentially growing demand and thusly, service inquiries. They could not physically hire qualified people at the rate at which their industry is growing. It's going to take some time for things to level off and they can catch up. In the mean time, it should be expected it will take MONTHS, not days, or even weeks for them to get to every inquiry they have received. It doesn't make them a shitty company, it makes them a company faced with unprecedented growth and demand. Ultimately, that's a pretty good place to be. There's a reason THEY are the company facing these kinds of numbers. They've been doing it right for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:56:12
The mods shouldn't have to deal with it because it shouldn't happening. Also, people who don't understand how simple bank transfers work probably shouldn't be throwing thousands of dollars into any investment of any kind.

@_date: 2017-12-16 01:04:45
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:05
Oh there most definitely is a bubble. If you don't know that, it's probably because you've never invested in anything besides crypto. You can protect yourself against a bubble for the most part, but there is most definitely a bubble.
The prices are rising... LITERALLY because prices are rising. People aren't buying in because of technology. They see that number climbing and that's it. That is a textbook bubble, my friend. The question is not if, but when, it will pop...and how much it will shrink. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:10:21
This right here. This sub pretends like there's nothing to fear until faced with reality. BTC needs work to compete. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:24:59
No it won't. Banks make their money from interest on loans. People needing to borrow whatever ding dong currency you think will replace fiat will always be a thing and banks will always have a hand in it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:14
Whatever it is, it's chaos. Can't even get an accurate price on anything on GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:34:26
Maybe. But every time it tanks, it just shoots right back up higher. Sound familiar? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:01:21
Yep. People sold at 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k, 11k, 12k, and 13k. I'm just sitting on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:41:53
That's not how this stuff works. Resistance past 20k won't develop until we actually hit 20k. There's also no resistance above 50k either. Doesn't mean we're hitting 100k next week.
When we hit 20k, and stay there, a nice wall will develop at 21k. And so on and so on, and then there'll be a HUGE wall at 25k. 
The days of 100% growth in a month are over but HODL tight. The gains will still come.

@_date: 2017-12-27 03:04:07
It's not a fiasco. A lot of people believe in bcash. It's a legitimate altcoin I guess. That's what the people have decided. I agree it's confusing for the uninitiated but forks happen and we have to deal with it. I don't think an exchange should have to pick a side. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:21:55
Just lucky I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:59:38
I believe that too. I was merely saying that in it's current state, it's pretty broken. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:40:24
Except it won't. Why do people keep saying this? BCH isn't going away. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:46
This isn't a dip. This is the end. BCH available on Coinbase? We're in trouble. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:26:03
It was a nice 10% dip. Of course, I missed it because I closed my eyes for an hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:05:49
Hold on now.. If BTC is the superior coin, then what are we worried about? We should welcome the competition to show that BTC is the king. Unless it's not.

I take the taxes out of my gains and set them aside. Who just takes the gains and spends all of it? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:03:20
Thing is.. All these companies are being faced with exponential demand. Imagine you, as one person, operated a small sales booth that does 10-20 sales a day. And then suddenly you start getting 50 customers, and the next week, 200. Next month, 1000. You could not physically hire enough people to keep up with that rate of demand. Service would drop off a cliff for a while, until you could catch up by hiring more people.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:59:35
BCH, Coinbase, LTC drama. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:41:41
Here's the thing about a bubble.. It doesn't mean the end of the asset. Amazon took a huge lick during the .com bubble. Ultimately, BTC will survive any potential crash, as it has in the past, but we are most definitely in the midst of a current bubble.
The moral of the story is being in for the long term. This bubble will only hurt day traders and alt coins in the end.
That said, 90%+ of the money flowing into BTC for the last year has been from investors or casuals looking to make a dollar. A FIAT dollar. That's it. Any allusion otherwise is simply delusion. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:40
Your 13k order is ready, sir. Would you like a glass of 14k with that? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:38:31
According to most people here, that's no excuse. If they can't handle the traffic, they should close the doors for a while. I am not of this opinion. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:12:52
The premise of bitcoin as a "get rich quick" method did indeed go viral. It's the very reason the cost became so inflated and why coin base struggled through it. No one saw it coming and that's how viral concepts work. Obviously that kind growth was unsustainable so when it stagnated people got out and got back into assets with better returns and reliability. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:42:38


Unless your bank IS the stock exchange, this is not possible. That's not how stock sales work. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:50:57
Why though? On the off chase that it will go viral again? It's probably one of the worst investments one could have made this year. Best Buy stock grew more. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:17:19
Also, I agree that if it happens again all the major exchanges will be well prepared and we'll all go to the moon!

Do I really need to point out what's wrong with a currency that requires this? 
Problem B)
Bitcoin has never seen a sniff of the kind of traffic VISA sees. If it did, the network would all but shut down.

No. I was talking about Bitcoin's fees.

Even then I have my doubts, but it's a start. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:33:43
Which is why I made point A) to begin. What I mean by network shut down is half of the people using is would stop at least temporarily because of the fees.

On Bitcoin Gold.. Thing is.. None of this stuff has any intrinsic value. It's value comes from the people that buy it. They create value in an otherwise worthless technology. None of these coins are ever going to replace fiat. I think deep down people know that, otherwise they wouldn't keep referring to them in their fiat value and caring so much about it. Very few people care about the tech, or transaction fees/time. We care about seeing that $/£ sign go up. It's quite a strange phenomenon to observe in human psychology, but here we are. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:51:24
In what way did they push 2x? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:54:13

It's the same company. GDAX *is* Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:32:10

Here's your crash. Get in now. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:57:29
Yes, but when you buy this stuff through an exchange that is designed for easy conversion do a different asset, this information is collected. No different than buying stocks. Your stock gains aren't taxable until converted to fiat, but given the ease of which that is done, the info needed to report the income is collected beforehand to prevent tax evasion and fraud. Basically, Coinbase is covering their ass here. Don't like it? Mine your own coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:31:40
I mean.. These companies and this entire industry is pretty new. And yesterday's volume was unprecedented and impossible to predict. It's unfortunate that it caused hiccups but this is a thing that happens. I used to sell cell phones for a living. When a new iPhone would come out, inevitably it would log jam AT&amp;T's activation systems. AT&amp;T. It happens. Cable signals go out. Internet goes down. Websites get ddos'd out of service.
It's a part of growing. They'll get better. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:20:54
Coinbase is as trustworthy as Fidelity, Scottrade, Ameritrade, Robinhood, etc ... for maintaining assets in my opinion. Take that for what it's worth. I've been investing for 15 years and never been fucked by any of these companies.

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:07:37
No one is using these currencies to pay for anything though. So why would anyone care about this? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:28:18
So there's this thing called a stop order. Let's say you buy in at 11k. Decide how much of your investment you're willing to risk. Let's say.. 10%. You'd put a stop order in place that would sell your BTC if the price hit 9.9k. A crash that severe is unlikely but if it happens, you're only out 10% of your investment.
Alternatively, if the price keeps climbing, keep changing your stop order to trail the current price by the same 10%. Try not to set a stop so close to the current price that it's triggered by daily fluctuations in the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:34:18
Read my other comment about stop orders. You can protect yourself from losses even if the price drops. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:24:18
I'm guessing you believed BTC wasn't reaching $8000 any time soon either just a few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:54:43
I'm just saying.. Tiny little orders didn't cause it. It's simply not possible. Maybe you overlooked a HUGE order or several of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:21:16
I'm guessing you haven't been watching BCH or BTC very long. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:50:06
Media coverage. And social media. There's been a huge increase in POSITIVE media coverage this year. And these huge numbers get people's attention more than the $50 prices we used to see in the early days. $1000 was enough to get people's attention and it just snowballed. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:22:29

You were saying? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:13:29


That's not how it works. 100 orders for .01 BTC will not affect the price any differenty than a single order for 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:49:51

I bought in at $2200, early last year. I'm good. I'm just thinking that money could be growing faster elsewhere now. Been waiting for this thing to rebound and it's just not happening. I hate watching my money stagnate. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:34:42
I did. At 17k. Paid off my car and have a nice chunk of change left over. But given the exponential (and in my opinion, unsustainable) growth, I don't think I'm getting back in until it hits 12k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:08:26

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:40:06
Been trying to explain this to people for months. In 2017, cryptocurrency became a viral fad and nothing more. The people that poured money into it, didn't understand it, and just hoped it would keep climbing. Now, those people are bailing. They will continue to bail until there's nothing left but the people that believe in and understand the technology. I needn't remind you of the price of bitcoin when those were the only players in the game. We'll be sub 5k within weeks.

that's going to take a few days.

true.. just because something is banned doesn't mean it goes away. murder is banned. but it would probably happen considerably more were it legal.

No, it's just that no one else really handled the traffic better. When Coinbase started having trouble, this sub told everyone to go to Gemini. Take a guess what happened then. The exchanges didn't have a chance. No one was prepared for this thing to go viral the way it did. Now, as things die off, we'll see some normalcy return. Also, to OP, if you waited until freaking November or December of 2017 to join in the fun, I can't feel sorry for you missing out. That's on you, not the exchanges.

Preferably current. As in **after** the gold rush of 2017.
*edit: Did my own research and found the source of this claim and it's literally just a guess. No one knows how much bitcoin is owned by whales. Any claims to the contrary is pure speculation.

So we're 3 months into the year, and if you've hedl this entire time, you've lost money.. I've made more far more money on my NFLX stock. BTC doesn't seem like the best investment right now. Hopefully long term, it'll pay off.

Speculation posts are freaking garbage. Seems every day a post like this makes the front page.

I see. well all I plan on doing is buying and selling back crypto using only their site for now I guess.

what part of their TOS tends to become an issue for some people? seems pretty straightforward to me. I'm not sure how one could get their account closed there.

why? what's wrong with coinbase? I'm new to this.

It's not about investing at the bottom of a dip, it's about getting in at a point below where the evidence says it will end up. Bitcoin isn't going to drop to $0 right now and it will most definitely rise above $2500 again. I've made thousands upon thousands of dollars off initial $200 investment (in stocks, not crypto). It's really not that hard to do if you simply keep up with the news.

No one knows. Stop asking. We all just have to wait and see.
