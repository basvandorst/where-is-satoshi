Long story short, I printed a metal coin for my dad who is into cryptocurrency and he loved it. He suggested for me to open a shop where people would be able to buy their own keychains/pendants.
I would be offering from stainless steel and niquel all the way to silver and gold 3D prints. I am using this post just to gauge the interest from the community.
Thanks in advance!

thanks! me neither, but anyway I am talking about 30EUR for steel and more pricey indeed for gold and silver.

Sorry for my ignorance, why having a QR code would be relevant here? And how would you go about putting it in there? Maybe I could design it in.

well with the lowcost tech that I am thinking about to keep it low maybe a QR code wont be all tha readable. With the latest more expensive machines (SLM) that would definetly be possible even if the size of it is only like a 2EURO coin.

This one is stainless steel with golden plating. Actually this is just from the internet, my dad and I live far appart and I did not take a picture of his. However, he's constantly messaging me because he gets all the compliments. It's like a 2EUR coin and it weights about that.

no not at all, at work I use a bunch of printers. I also have access to different metal printing tech, here I am looking at metal powder with binding agents. The part needs to then be sintered in an oven and will shrink like 20%. For gold etc first print a wax model and then cast it into the precious metal.

since this is a bit off-topic I will send you a pm to ask for more details.

I am looking at 15EUR manufacturing cost, and marking it up to 30-50 depending on finish and shipping. More pricey for the so called "precious metals" :P
