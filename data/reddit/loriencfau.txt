Sell the cards; save the PSUs if you want to buy an ASIC in the future.  The current margin for ASIC mining is razor thin, but if you 'enjoy' the mining process, razor thin is enough.
Also, current math on making back your invested coins is based on historical difficulty trends--you know the saying...

actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

I pulled out my laptop to log in and call you a dick.

I immediately decided to call it Windex, as well!

Sounds rad.  Pics or it didn't happen.

This is all Ngoc vinegar!

I was about to chastise you, but you done edited it before I could.  Have you personally mined before?

To clarify, it might be _more_ than 0.1, not less.

I would be happy to point my miner at Eligius with your address--you would get minted coins, but I couldn't guarantee that it would be exactly 0.1 BTC.  PM me if you want.

Now that I stop to consider it for a brief instant, I realize the error in my logic.  Thank you for enlightening me of my own poor standards--you're surely correct in your ascertainment.  I can only imagine your quick wit and capability to be snide to strangers on the internet makes you the life of every party you attend!
Also, you are an asshole and write poorly.
edit: lololololol; I fixed a typo and am also an asshole. ;-)

A reasonable reply--I'll respect your opinion.

I was thinking about switching to a faster service--this locks it up.

You had to force me to log in, didn't you?
While the Aaron Swartz narrative ended in tragedy that no one would deny, the catalyst was Mr. Swartz committing a crime.  It's fair to assume that MIT will be a better host environment for the core developers; if it's not, **we'll change the environment or the core developers.**

You should watch it sometime--I've seen some of the most compelling interviews I've ever watched on the Daily Show.
