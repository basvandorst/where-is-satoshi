I just answered the question of what is market socialism , I don't know why everyone is barraging me with questions about how this or how that with socialism.
People build the means of production, just the same as they do in capitalism. Where do they get the iron to build the machines? People mine it. How do you feed the miners? People farm the land.  Where do you get the land? It's already fucking there.

Have fun with your slaves and child labor with capitalism, because slaves and children obviously have the choice not to work. Also have fun building more straw man, the crux to your debating ability. Instead of anarchism you will choose to have kings, the owners of property who will enforce their will upon others who "choose" to work and live on there land. Private property is inherently a means to enforce the will of the owner of the means of survival upon those who do not own.

There are state socialist flavors as well as anarcho socialist flavors. 
As far as safety nets, it depends. There are a wide variety of views. I was just answering your question of what market socialism means.

Socialism means the workers own the means of production.  That plus a market.

Those are all state socialist societies/totalitarian dictatorships. Try anarchist Spain during the Spanish civil war to be actually correct about what an anarchist society would look like(way to history bud). You should look at feudalist societies and prerevolution industrial societies to see what true capitalism gets you. 
Also fuck off with your belittling statements and accusations of ignorance. Way to ad hominem. If you want to debate, debate(which you started, not me) but don't blatantly insult me you fuck face.

What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:47:06
I wish I was at a computer so I could more easily address all of your strawmen. 
Does reward magically disappear in a socialist society? Do workers not have free time? (and it is assumed they will have much more time and money considering no capitalist will be taking all of the profits) The crux of your argument relies on the fact that a few will not be able to pay for new means of production because they can't save, well maybe the workers could organize and agree to take portions of their profits to reinvest in new manufacturing. (no organization by workers that does anything similar to this has ever existed though, right?) That the workers are working does not mean that they could not pay someone else who builds machines to build them new ones. A market still exists, and surely there will be a market for machine builders. 
If reward in the form of short term profits was the only thing we cared about(as it is to capitalist) trains, highways, dams, computers, and the Internet would not exist. The state(we, assuming you live in the United states) has paid for the prerequisite research and funding to create all of these things. They would not exist in the truly capitalist society you desire.

All I did was answer the question asked, what is market socialism,  and you start with shit about government theft, so you deserve the snide. I didn't even express my own actual views and you accuse socialism as a whole of inherently meaning theft. 
I doubt you have actually even read proudhon. 
Edit: also who the fuck goes around saying "I'm well versed" to prove the fact you know what you're talking about, especially after you've already shown your own ignorance by not educating yourself to the views of an anarchist as well as building straw men.

My argument has hardly failed, you just think it has. All that market socialist believe is that profit without work is fraudulent. You can buy a machine that someone has built, this isn't inherently wrong. If you pay someone to work on a machine and withhold what they make(ie rent the machine) this is fraudulent. They are not paying the machine builders to work, they are paying the machine builders to build a new machine which they buy. Way to build another strawman due to your lack of understanding of what an anarchist believes. 
Private property would not exist in an anarchist society, so they obviously wouldn't own the machine they don't want to own/work on, and no one would be forced to pay anything. If they don't want to work on the factory that everyone else wants to improve, then they can quit working there, but if they don't work they shouldn't expect to gain anything. 
You should read some basic anarchist literature because it's obvious you have never read any before, and I don't  want to have to explain to you piece by piece what had been written in hundreds of books before. I would suggest you read Tucker or Bakunin. 
I don't belive in absentee ownership, and it's inherent in all of your arguments that it must exist. You would rather have a capitalist dictate how its workers work and to have their work be taken from them instead of workers being entitled to what they make. I believe profit without work is fraudulent.

Hubski is the only decent alternative I have ever found, but it's still not the same.
What mainly made it shitty was the influx of people. It ruined the quality of most of the big subs. Not saying more people doesn't have benefits in certain subs, like but for most it doesn't.
Another thing that makes reddit shitty now is the large number of power hungry/corrupt mods. Censorship has become a serious problem on this website. This can also be connected to the fact that the userbase has gotten so large. Groups with interests in controlling what information flows out of this website, since so many people do get their news/facts from this place, have infiltrated into moderator positions/corrupted mods to censor information. Mods of subs like and have way too much power than they should and this is shown by mods like banning the RT domain from entirely. Essentially this website is run as a dictatorship and not a democracy, and the mods will completely agree with this statement and most point to the fact that anyone who disagrees with them should shut the fuck up since they can make a new sub anytime they want, regardless of the fact that they had nothing to do with the popularity of subreddits with such generic names like or that are default subs and the fact that everyone contributes to the sub through commenting and posting links.
The mod situations are some weird shit.
Go to for more info, although from what I understand it cannot be trusted anymore either b/c someone proven to be corrupt is now a moderator there as well.
Edit: Another thing is the shills. It was pretty crazy when the snowden shit was happening how if you did something like make a comparison to 1984 the shills were jumping at you saying how absurd and crazy you were to be making a connection like that. I don't sub anymore to most of the places where this shit happens, but I do sub to and you can definitely still notice shills from the kremlin making comments.
Either way, I don't like the fact that this place used to be so anti-state and now this place has moved far far to the right from where it used to be.

Well, they could buy them, or build them. There are plenty of worker owned businesses that exist in our society today. They were obviously  not stolen, you're just putting words in my mouth and making unfounded assumptions. I just answered a question. Socialism can arise in many different ways, and socialism does not inherently mean there must be a state, that is state Socialism, or that means of production are stolen. Also it depends on the belief of property, read Proudhon to see a different view on the topic. Please bother to read about anarcho socialism/syndicalism and do not assume that there is only one form of socialism. There is obviously not one form of capitalism, anyone who has bothered to read even a little bit about socio political systems knows it's not that simple.

If you can make a machine that would be so profitable, why would you ever sell them?
