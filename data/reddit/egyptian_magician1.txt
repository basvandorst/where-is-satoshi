Summer time man. People who dont work in finance or trading are all occupied and on vacation. Wait and see what happens when school gets into full swing.

I didnt know that was coming up already. Is there a specific trigger for it?

My gf asked me this morning before she left at what price I would sell.
"I guess when I need the money?"
I also have no desire to sell but would have no problem if it came down to it. It's already a nice chunk of change. Would be cool to see it in the 5 digit range.

Same.... but the surge surely has to be more than quick buck folks. What brought us out of $4k?

I have lots but dude you ain't making much sense.

I started in late 17 and yesterday was my first day in the green overall.(including my eth and Golem positions) 
Glad I stopped checking prices as much as I used to and put it away for a rainy day.
Feels good man.

Do what now ?
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:12:59
Thank you.

What does this mean ?
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:20:25
Correct me if I'm wrong but that pools all the sell orders together and is like saying "2,100 BTC for sale at $11,000" and isnt just 1 single person.

She makes more than me so if she's dipping in to my bitcoin we got more problems than shopping.

How can I avoid this?  This is BS and will be switching to something else if this is the standard.

This post is BS. "Needed money for gifts" so... you would have sold no matter what the price was at.

What did you do with your 1.4m?
