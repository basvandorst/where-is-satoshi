No. This applies only to miners. And it is the % of total hashing power, not number of miners.
 If bitcoin could be manipulated by controlling a majority of nodes, then you could spin up enough nodes on AWS to pwn everyone for a few thousand dollars.
Nodes, while essential, are a dime a dozen.

Got any old computers laying around? Doesn't have to be a fast one. Throw Ubuntu and Bitcoin-Qt on it and save you wallet in 3 or more places every time you get a new address. Easy peasy.

The justification that governments use for their authority over us is that we consented to it. If I don’t like it, I am free to repudiate my citizenship and leave. And while I agree in principle that this is a valid justification, indeed the only valid justification for a government existing, it isn't actually true in practice that I consented to be ruled. 
If I am assigned a default citizenship at birth, not allowed to start a new state, and every other existing state is as bad or worse than the one I am currently in, then it is a joke to say that my failing to leave is an affirmative act of consent. If I am to be hanged unless I choose a different method of execution, it does not mean that I consented to be hanged.
For society to function at any meaningful level, we need government, and that government must be embued with authority over its citizens. And as long as those citizens freely chose to be governed by a particular state, I have no moral or philosophical qualms about that state exercising coersive or even violent control over those citizens. I don’t much care what rules a state comes up with, as long as the people in those states are free to leave if they disagree.
I think we should have thousands of consentually self-governed states, and anyone with land and good ideas should be allowed to declare themselves sovereign. While that sounds great, there is no way the current power structure of the world would ever let that happen. It is universally considered treason by the 144 existing nations of the world. That’s the real rub. People are allowed to leave countries, but they're not allowed to take their property with them. 
Even in the freest most capitalist nation there is or has ever been, private individuals don't really own anything. In the government's view, you do not own your land, you rent your land from them. You can keep doing so as long as you use it in a way they approve of and pay them their rent every year. If you fail to do either, they will simply take it back with an amount of force you could not in your wildest dreams ever hope of defending against. 
You don’t own your stuff either. You’re allowed to hold on to it so long as you use it in a way they approve of. You pay them for this privilege everytime you acquire something new, and evertime you transfer something you already have (even after you are dead). If you use it in a way they don't like, or fail to pay these rents, they will send men with guns to take it.
You don’t even own your money. It’s their money. They control it's value and regulate how and when and for what it may be used. You pay them for this privilege too. 
The only thing you really own is your life, and your right to this, the most fundamental, intimately inalienable thing there is, is contingent on your compliance with their rules. While they permit us to participate in a much wider range of activities in the US than any other state allows, there is still a mind numbingly large list of things you're not permitted to do, or are required to do. They get a cut of any value you produce with blood and sweat. If proven to be in violation of any of these restrictions, they will take more of your stuff, put you in a cage, or kill you.
Of all things they forbid, there is one forbid above the rest: threatening their power. They spend billions on entire agencies devoted solely to making sure no one threatens their authority. Treason is universally the most serious crime in all nations. The most common use of an army is not protecting the people against invading nations, it's protecting nations from their own people.
How then, in such an environment could one ever possibly hope to establish a system of true private ownership and sovereignty? Until very recently, the only ways to attempt this were: occupying a failed state, armed insurrection against an existing one, or convincing a nation to relinquish almost all of its power. All of which would be fought tooth and nail by the full force of at least one nation state, and probably a collition of several. Such an effort would, certainly and without exception, fail.
Bitcoin is the only hope we have to break this cycle by first establishing a digital world reflective of our crypto-anarchist ideals, safe in cyberland where all their thugs and guns don't count for shit.

I would suspect most Chinese nodes are tunneled to less restrictive countries as opposed to just running them bareback like we do in the freedom loving west. I personally would not run a node in China without using tor or at least a VPN that pops out in somewhere that's not China.
There's probably a lot more Chinese nodes than geoip would make it appear. You can help them add more by building up their shitty data infrastructure or by making the communist party into more chill dudes for awhile, perhaps with a pan of pot brownies or a really disarming story about love.

This is mostly correct. Full nodes validate each transaction they encounter against their copy of the blockchain to make sure it is valid before gossiping it. Any transactions that are facially invalid are just dropped on the floor. So if 7999 nodes are all colluding to send bad transactions, but 1 node fully validates transaction against its own local copy of the chain, bitcoin would still work assuming that 1 node is reachable. The worst that could happen is a ddos. Even 100% of nodes in collusion cannot orchestrate a theft like a 51% miner could. 
Tldnr=Nodes only decide if they will broadcast a transaction or not, nothing else. Miners decide what the block chain says, and 51% in collusion can decide it says send all bitcoins to X.

On your own computer or a piece of paper. There are no fees to store bitcoin unless you pay someone else to hold on to your computer or piece of paper.

They have awesome internet infrastructure there, lots of VPS providers. People are hosting cloud nodes there.

Not worried, just a theoretical question. If someone stole all the BTC they would become worthless anyway, so no one would even if it was possible. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 23:49:33
So we're going to put a million Bitcoins in hot wallets connected to the internet. Your ONLY job is make sure no one steals them okay? We'll pay you whatever you want, just please don't let anyone take all of them. Like for real. That's the one thing you need to make sure never happens.

Forward this to 10 people in 10 minutes or your mining luck with drop to 0 for 10 months. This is real, it happend to my brother.
