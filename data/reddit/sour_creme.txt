the devil laughs because in 200 years, when the climate of the earth has burned up due to people using infinite amounts of energy to mine the last remaining bitcoins, people will discover that out of 21 million bitcoins possible, most of them were either lost or unrecoverable due to hacking, computer error from solar radiation, etc. etc.

jp morgan moving ahead with their own version of the digital wallet.  and some news sources are saying it will rival bitcoin.  while it seems obvious news media don't understand what bitcoin is all about, any institutional investor coming in will want to dictate their own terms, in this case jp morgan wanting to create their own wallet system. and what currency willl it use?  whatever they can control, and it's certanly not going to be bitcoin.  the general public doesn't understand much let's be frank, and it will go with big banks because they believe in perceived stability.  government backdoors, cryptocurrency, all that doesn't concern the public, big banks know this, and will have their day.

elon musk founded x.com 
then elon musk closed x.com practically overnight, turning his interests instead to paypal.  a lot of people who wer using x.com were left in the dark.
don't think paypal is your friend, they are not.
