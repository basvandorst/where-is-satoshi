It is golden bullshit, never ending ever expanding gold.

You are correct that it is inflationary for now in terms of the money supply increasing about 4.3&amp; currently, About 2&amp; In 2020, then under 1&amp; for 2024 and onward. I can not find any current estimations of the amount of Bitcoin that is lost per year at the current price, but if if it is 0.05&amp; lost per year Bitcoin will start to decrease its circulating supply every year in about 22 years and onwards.  
Any coin that has a fixed amount of coins issued per year forever (like monero eventually) will start out inflationary (money supply) and eventually end up with a roughly fixed as the money supply grows to a point where the same number of coins will be lost on average.  
Those who advocate long term speculating/holding will point towards the 10&amp; inflation from 2015-2016 and say that even with that inflation the price rose, so imagine the rise in the future when inflation is even lower.  
But speculators (hodlers) do not give a hoot about Bitcoin being inflationary or deflationary in terms of the money supply, they want know if it the price per coin will increase their purchasing power (deflationary) or if it will decrease their purchasing power (inflation).

Most professional traders and organizations are not able to beat the market benchmark in their funds when the cost of trading and administration is taken into account over the long term. Which is why passive index funds on average over time gives a better return compared to the actively managed funds. The cumulative effect of that shows up in decades. Any trader can massively outperform the benchmark for any short period of time, but on average, over time, most will not be able to recoup the cost of the trades in gains over holding.  
Active trading can be very beneficial in bear markets and for higher returns than the market short term.  
It is not that most day traders lose it all, it is just that the majority of them get outperformed compared to if they just held what they actively trade over the long term. The vast majority of trades today are made by machines that run on models and data that is way better than what we are able to.

Abilities to create value would be my guess.
