There is nothing completely new in the year 2019 in which crypto assets are left on an exchange and the exchange goes insolvent.

Dude my 60 year old dad is even buying Bitcoin, it's mainstream. He didn't buy it when I told him either, he bought it when he heard it on the Glenn Beck show.

Nah, already told him about the thousands of times that happened already.
Really how did anyone fall for that, fool me a thousand times shame on me.

Is coinbase pro unavailable? I've been using it to get Bitcoin without fees since it first came out, you just have to post as maker instead of a market buy.
