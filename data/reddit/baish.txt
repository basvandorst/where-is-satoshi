in which case your "real money" is simply a derivative form of USD. you've accomplished nothing.

yes, but we're talking about USD, here - not other currencies. that it would be worth more or less USD over time doesn't, ultimately, matter. if you are forced to convert your preferred currency to USD to extinguish tax liability, from a macroeconomic point of view your currency is still simply redesigned USD. once a year you are forced to examine your balance sheet, interpret it into the USD that it ultimately is, and pay taxes based on the USD translation of your balance sheet. then you can go back to pretending it's whatever you prefer it is.
...and since federal taxes aren't the only taxes you pay, you're probably actually doing that on an almost daily basis. which is the point here.

word. if i had it i'd probably drop the 25k on a prototype tomorrow; i'd love to see them get enough support to bring this thing to fruition. sounds like most of the "problems" w/ the prototype could be solved by buying a new skin when the final production model comes out, too.

Steve Forbes obviously does not understand the ramifications of living in a country that is a monopoly issuer of its own fiat currency. how else explain the comparison of america and france (among other statements)?
the biggest legal barrier to alternative currencies is that only the USD can extinguish US tax liabilities. that can not go away for obvious reasons... should other legal barriers also be removed? i'd be interested to hear from someone who actually understands fiat currency theory.

good for you. the discussion is and always was about USD.

same answer: 
all this accomplishes is wasting energy redesigning USD to make folks feel better about using them.
