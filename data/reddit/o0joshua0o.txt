Is it possible for a person to somehow end up in another timeline even if they haven't done any time traveling? It was definitely Berenstein throughout my childhood.

First SR1 and now SR2. Why, it's enough to discourage you from using cryptocurrency to fund illegal activities!

I won't argue with you there. It sounds like there is no shortage of entrepreneurs when there's lots of money to be made.

This is good for Bitcoin.

I'm new to BTC (only familiar with DOGE so far). Where do I purchase BTC? 
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:44:05
That sounds like a limited conception of "innovation".

Is BTC real, and BCC is just an imposter; or is BCC the new and improved version that will leave BTC in the dust?

How do you find out if you have a balance?

It would be diabolical to put malware on a USB stick and give it this label

I try to trick it by just buying a tiny amount.

Anyone have a list of Chinese exchanges?

Good quote (although right now I'm not too happy with my position in Ford Motor Company). I wish I'd put those funds into BTC.

The pattern thus far is a bubble followed by a flat period, then a larger bubble, then another flat period, etc. But the prediction part omits the next flat period and goes straight to the bubble.

Where is the exact bottom? I'm trying to time it exactly with the money I need to pay rent next month.

They can't control it directly, but they can try to control the points where it gets exchanged for fiat. They can also analyze the blockchain in order to pursue tax evaders.

They have value as long as people attribute value to them and keep putting fiat into them or keep accepting them in exchange for goods or services. I agree, though, that there has to be a limit. An infinite number of cryptocurrencies isn't sustainable.

Wait, aren't you a guy from Reddit? You're going to send me into an infinite recursion loop. ;)

Honestly, any volatile investment can ruin you if you're not careful. 
No way to know if the bubble assessment is correct without underlying fundamentals to assess.

Step one: spook the market, or wait for a panic
Step two: place large buy orders
Step three: ??? (actually HODL)
Step four: profit!!!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:50:48
I do feel better now. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:27:27
Don't worry about China and HODL. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:01:44
Maybe it would crash initially, because it would be unpredictable. But if you started moving small amounts on a predictable schedule, the market would adapt.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:30:51
Mind. Blown. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:30:20
But you can't do that anonymously either, can you?
