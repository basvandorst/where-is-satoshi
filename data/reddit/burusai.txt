Buddy..... those are women.

Working fine on Siri :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:44:51
He’s right.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:28:45
That's true, but it could probably sell all your BTC for a coin with low volume and then sell that coin very very cheap back to the seller. He would then swap it back to BTC or whatever at normal exchange rate. Should work right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:05:55
I’m not saying BTC will hit 100K this year. I doubt that personally. But the last 3 years we’ve had a crash on the entire market beginning of January. And then by end of February/March it goes on a rally and goes higher than before the crash. Look at graphs.
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:09:41
If it drops to $0 it could be.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:59:14
That’s Floyd.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:25:05
No. On an exchange you don’t own your Bitcoin (since you don’t own your private key). The only thing you can do is write Bittrex and find out why they have  disabled your account.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:36:33
No you couldn’t lol. Kids on reddit....
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:30:10
Up or down. Sound judgement there. You should become an investor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:58:16
Go to wallets. Click - next to Bitcoin. Send it to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:04:26
Do you live in the middle east? They seem to fuck over their customers from that region and basically freeze/steal the money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:09:23
Track the owner? The Bitcoin blockchain is public my dude :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:00:56
I would be more worried about Bitfinex than Bittrex personally.
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:35:30
It sounds a bit like you have no idea what it will and what it won’t reach :)
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:19:07
What is it going to?
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:25:41
So what you’re saying is you have no clue?
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:57:55
Believing in TA is stupid too ��
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:14:39
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:02:46
Same things I noticed. Also the emails contain your name.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:12:06
It might be pumped this high atm by bankers, so they can short the futures launching soon. That’s a real risk.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:07:59
The Mt Gox absurdity aside - $245 mil to run a website? Lol �� 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:28:00
It’s scary how many of you there are on reddit reading about Bitcoin, but you don’t have the slightest idea how a block chain works �� Spend 15 minutes and watch a YouTube vid, my god.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:34:26
It’s on their website.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:17:55
Nor sure how it happened? It sounds like you know exactly how it happened. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:12:32
Appears that he stole 1600 and returned 1500.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:56:09
The link goes to the real coinbase.com. It *appears* to be a real email, what is weird is they sent out another one first that looks very different. And then this email *twice* a full day later. I can see why someone would think they are scam emails.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:57:45


Same thing for you? A total of 3 emails about increased limit, with the last 2 a day later and different layout than the first?
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:40:00
Depends on the country. There are countries in EU where crypto isn’t taxed when sold for fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:31:12
Stop. You’re embarrassing yourself. There are 2 likely scenarios here: 
1) Several versions were made and pasted, all outcomes described/predicted.
2) Everything went down exactly like written.
Seeing how insanely BCH is being pumped by the Koreans/Chinese atm. I’d say it’s clear which is the most likely thing happening.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:57:32
Read the FAQ OP links to.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:20:37
Read the article for your answer:)
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:01:30
3 for me. First one looks like a normal Coinbase email. Then 2 more today that look like OPs, but they point to Coinbase.com and have my real name. Coinbase fucked up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:40:00
You don't think bankers with big money manipulate markets for personal gain? That's exactly how it works. And it's a lot easier in an unregulated market. If that is what's happening with the insane pump over the last few days, who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:00:29
How is it phishing tho? The Email contains REAL name and it points to REAL coinbase.com - It looks like someone at coinbase fucked up badly sending out these mails after the first increased limit mail.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:47:32
No it can’t. That’s not how pastebin works.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:41:11
True. Nothing is set in stone until December. Personally I believe it’s happening as planned.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:23:07
I never wrote it would reach 50k by eoy . And it in fact is over 5k, it’s around $6400 atm. ;-) Once the next cartel pump starts it could easily rise as quick as it did last year. Will be fun to see what happens with Bakt coming up.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:38:21
From public forum posts.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:19:32
Before or after fork shouldn’t matter. I’m expecting to see guides on reddit when we approach the fork block (if it even happens).
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:30:28
Bitcoin is valued in USD, it’s at $6400. And no ofc I wasn’t against the possibility of it reaching 50k in 2018, just like your type was against it reaching 20k in 2017. Only fools put their entire savings in one basket. I bought at 3k so I’m still comfortable for now.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:15:44
I bought WTC for the BCH money, can't say I regret that :P Free money that has 6x'd. Hoping to do something similar next HF.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:22:48
Care to explain why? as I see it my Bitcoin is as safe in Bread as in a hardware wallet. Both are just means of keeping an encrypted private key. If you want to convince me otherwise you'll need to explain your reasoning.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:30:06
You must not understand how blockchains work if you've ever thought they were stored in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:15:09
$999999 is decent.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:17:29
How did you lose 1.8 BTC trading Alts? That's unbelievably bad trading.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:50:20
What value? I invested $0 into BCH and still got my free money after HF. How is that real? That's a joke. Value out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:34:13
Why would BCH gain any value? Seems completely dead to me.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:04:11
How does this work? The customer orders, pays using bitcoin then waits 30-60 minutes for the payment to go through and get confirmations, then gets his sandwich? Or is there another way to use bitcoin as real time payment?
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:53:23
Bread should be as safe as a hardware wallet. Both are just tools to hold a private key. As long as you keep the device safe.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:25:52
You can choose node to follow in settings. It's entirely up to you lol.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:07:06
 But high sell low. Some people live by that slogan.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:19:30
It’s Google who allows these scammers to buy ad space. Why would people NOT bash Google? This is disgusting.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:24:39
You said you invested $0 into BTC. Are you just trolling now?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:41:46
Full. Of. Shit.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:23:43
No you didn't get a dime, that's the difference. I got money from BCH suckers that actually bought the free shitcoins I got :P
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:05:43
Wow, what an analysis!
Chance of it going to 2k is a lot lower than it going to 9k imho. If we're talking end of 2018.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:09:49
He used the rest of his BTC on pizzas. This wasn’t the only occasion he bought pizza for BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:00:39
They said they will let you choose chain manually too. But you're right, if you don't know what you're doing you risk losing coins.
My hope is that they will make it as easy to split coins as they did with BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:55:56
You don't think Bitcoin will have doubled by xmas 2018?
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:16:50
We'll see in 14 months :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:55:24
You will have a choice with Bread. They will let you split your coins. Perfectly safe to use. Just like BCH fork :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:16:04
I think it's more realistic that Bitcoin will forever be a crypto that is not really used for transactions, only for storing assets in. The cryptos that handle massive transsaction numbers with 10sec blocktimes will be the winners in that field. Both have its usses, I am not bashing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:19:04
Why? Free money to invest.
