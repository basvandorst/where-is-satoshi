Looked through the files....even went back with Time Machine to a week ago (in a tragic turn of events, I actually reset my Time Machine drive a week ago). I opened the oldest version of localstorage in an SQL editor, but payload isn't there. I think I'm boned. Here's hoping that blockchain gets back to me...I hope they won't ignore me forever. Thank you!

Cool. I'll give that a looksee.

Hey, my friend lost all of his bitcoins in a local wallet when Multibit crashed and destroyed his private key. Cryptocurrencies are still an emerging technology and have plenty of growing pains that need to be sorted out.

Sooooo close.
I logged in with Chrome a month ago, and "payload" was there! I was able to restore the private keys, but they weren't recent enough. (The keys were for my addresses "Savings 1" and "Savings 2"...unfortunately I need "Savings 3" which I created a couple of weeks ago.)
I've recently (a week and a half ago) logged in with Safari, but "payload" just isn't there. Do you think it might be cached somewhere else?
THANK YOU for your help. I'll tip heartily if I ever get my bitcoins back!

I tried to send a cheekynote with paypal, and ended up paying myself 10 bucks.

Aw shit...do they literally never reply? Do they never actually do two factor resets? I am so boned.

I totally understand this. I religiously back my wallets up (my other addresses are currently backed up locally), but I forgot one time. It's simple human error. Then, suddenly the two factor emails stop arriving. I'm losing almost $8000 USD because I didn't immediately back up one of my addresses...I'm in a bit of shock. 
I'm really disappointed in blockchain.info...having no customer support...claiming to reset 2FA and not following through.
And yea, I'm a customer. I've paid for their shared wallet services on many occasions. I've paid them money, and they can't even be bothered to email me back or follow through with a service they claim to offer. This is so rough...

I found the localstorage file...the most recent and the oldest versions of it don't contain payload. They do contain "guid" and "multiaddr" information, but that's it. I think things got screwed up when I unsuccessfully logged in to blockchain.info a bunch of times 10 days ago. If only I hadn't wiped my Time Machine drive a week ago...cruel, cruel fate. 
Thank you for all of your help.
