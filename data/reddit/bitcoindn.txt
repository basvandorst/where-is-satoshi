This is interesting. I hold some quality .bits, but i don't know if this is possible. 
Let me know if you get any updates. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 07:54:34
Did you hand reg it? 
Multisig.com was sold for x,xxx$, and I know there to be current xx,xxx offers on it today.

I am the owner of BitcoinWhitePaper.com and would be interested in hosting this. Let me know. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:38:36
Thats why you still have it! Your QT wallet just doesn't think it does. If it did, you wouldn't have it. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:30:52
Alright! I just finished up editing the HTML on my end, how would you like me to credit you? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:40:36
Then give them all .20$. 
No better way to get them involved then directly showing them how easy it is to transfer money. 
Have a presentation showing how to use coin punk for iOS, as well as block chain app for android.

Just because this is the sentiment, I am now certain bitcoin will astound everyone with a new wave of adoption, and overstock will have sales of $10M or so. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 05:09:02
developed their own.

If you just take the wallet.dat and literally drag and drop  into there, you will get the bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:04:03
Really glad you showed me this! 
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:43:30
I agree completely. It is an uninformed opinion that because of bitcoins unexpected rise, it must be a ponzi scheme that will come crashing down on anyone investing in this "fake" digital currency. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:58:26
Excellent. 
My last question is about the hardware RNG, wouldn't it be a target for being cracked since you would have access to all bitcoin trezor wallets across the world? 
Im reminded of the nintendo ds pokemon RNG hacks, and want to make sure this is different. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:19:50
worst case for the government 
@_date: 2014-08-10 04:12:05
What are your thoughts on using an electrum generated seed? It is 12 words compared to Trezors 24. 
And also, perhaps I am too dense, but how are you even able to use a non-trezor generated seed? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:27:12
I will repost my thoughts on Is their any legitimacy in my concern that a bug found in the closed source Darkcoin could be used to exploit the BTC/DRK trading pair and cause tremendous loss to the exchange?

Nope! Its not gone. Just do a rescan! This thread will help you out.
Mac: 
Windows: 
mac: cd /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/
./Bitcoin-Qt -rescan
bitcoin-qt.exe -rescan

See: Pooled Mining. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:39:46
If you want, just drag and drop the wallet.dat into blockchain.info's wallet app, it will automatically sweep the coins into your wallet. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:20:57
Burstcoin is a brand new coin that can HDD Mine. Might be something interesting for you to check out. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:48:26
You are a vulture. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 02:58:25
I can see why you would think that. I only googled "bitcoin blockchain wallet .dat"
I assume if you google that while logged in, you will be navigated to it while already logged in. That will be the quickest way to reclaim your wallet.dat
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:43:49
If you wait a short while, i will be launching PriceofBitcoin.com with a nice ticker and chart :).
In the meantime, BitcoinWisdom is great for traders. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:54:45
no, bitcoinwallet.com went for 250K. Bitcoin-wallet.com wouldn't do 20K. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:06:01
It will only reach the 3M per coin when it replaces the infrastructures mentioned. 
[Here]( is an info graphic showing previous technologies time to saturate their markets. 
For Bitcoin, I think it could reach the mark in about 4-7 years. It is already accelerating much faster than previous technologies, primarily due to the internet.

Bookmarked! When I get back home you'll get some gold as well. :)

 was so kind as to have a flexible license, and a great design, so I updated BitcoinWhitepaper.com with his css design. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:47:45
What do you mean, a BTC address leaked? Did they just give him more money instead?
@_date: 2014-05-05 06:42:14
It is fully up and running, thanks a lot for having such a welcoming license! 
I figure it is a little bit easier to get to my site then yours so it should help a small amount of people out. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:14:10
Agreed. 
I am actually seeing that it was posted July 30th, 2014. Not sure what would cause it to display 2012, as the domain was registered on March 29, 2013

I have just done that, and still get the same error. any ideas? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:57:28
ha! perfect image for a price analysis article. thanks for making it :)

couldn't the boot loader be cracked? 
Android phones are regularly cracked, and there is direct financial incentive to find a crack to trezor's boot loader. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 07:14:17
new error now after some googling 
"cannot find ludev"
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:44:43
mine is the same. it doesn't bother me. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 20:15:47
You'd best not tell us where you store your private keys. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:46:19
@_date: 2014-08-16 05:09:50
Too much risk to use your stash mother load with mycelium app. the private key is no longer secure after it has been used even once. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 04:12:14
Thats what I thought :(
@_date: 2014-10-19 07:30:00
ha, after 6 hours of troubleshooting! no thanks. I just wish mytrezor.com would work! 
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:36:32
Bitcoin's adoption rate has slowed, which is consistent after bubbles. [Here]( is the current interest in Bitcoin, which I believe has bottomed out and will start to rise from here. 
For Bitcoin to replace current infrastructure, it must act as a backbone for new systems of commerce. Bitcoin must eventually be used as a clearinghouse for off-chain visa and master card transactions. These types of developments will be the reason Bitcoin advances to massive valuations.

5 years of non use in blocks generated time.

Unfortunately, this is the Issue with buying a non-dot com, as I know all too well. I went on a buying spree on godaddy auctions to ensure that if I would ever need any more domains, I would have a variety to choose from.
When you start a business on a domain other then .com, you are giving the .com tons of traffic for free. This is not a good start to a business. 
If you're interested in the kinds that I bought, you can check out

CoinURL is very small. Adsense is massive, and offers far more prioritization avenues. I'm guessing he wouldn't make as much money using CoinURL.
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:08:23
His body language is defensive and suspicious. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:49:07
A great point you could make to any mainstream media source still stuck on bitcoin being a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:24:12
What would declaring that look like? It's not like I could just buy on Gemini, and the same day, sell it to my friend, and not be a money transmitter correct? Then there's no gain since the transaction will occur so quickly after purchase 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:28:59
Does it still need to be declared? Do you know how that declaration might look? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:40:18
Which is fine to do until you hit a certain limit and become a money transmitter, correct? 
If so, I think I got it; thank you. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:51:53
But in case I am in a state in which it is money transmission, I still do not need a license for something small like 250$
