It stores your private key a place where noone can reach it (I'm not sure if the ower is able to either). And when you want to send the funds, you tell the device how much and to wich address, and the tx will be signed on the device. Now this tx is submited to the internet. So even if your computer is compromised, your private key will not get discovered.
Edit: spelling

The early protocols used for the internet is still there. Some is more popular than others, but the IP suite is old, still used, and gets updated slowly.

Don't keep your bitcoins in your head. They might get lost when you really really need them.

Use a standalone bruteforcer. Make a list of all the combinations you would like to test and run it against the wallet.

This would loose the trader money, as there is a fee to "take" the offer on the trade. There is often no fee when making an offer, so this is most likely a "maker bot"

I am tempted to answer this by imaging free software without Linux. You may do it, but the popularity of Linux will overshadow other attempts for a while.

You spent the universal currency to make a bitcoin. That does not automaticly grant you energy if you spend a bitcoin.

No, look at the west, and look to eastern europe, Africa and the middle East. They are lagging behind.
Where is it easier to invest your money? In the west, and now maybe in China. Those who are good in capitalism seems to be ahead.

Read up on some economics and then let's discuss. "The history of money" by Yuval Noah Harari is a start.
How will a market measured in bitcoin ensure that it is profitable to invest, and lend out bitcoin? It needs to be for it to be working.
You don't know why he made bitcoin, or that it is going to be successful.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:27:55
False. Look at how Manny have their own car now, campared to 1920, or 1960. There has been inflation, but things are much easier to buy.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:19:26
Interesting! Thanks for your comments!
@_date: 2018-07-21 06:56:29
You mean banks lending out nonexisting money?
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:57:46
Where is your arguments really? I already made some I would like you to address.
@_date: 2018-07-20 09:01:29
Inflation encourage spending and investing, because you get the most for your money today. This is how it encourage sharing.
An interest rate lower than the inflation rate we would agree seems skeewed. 
And the stock market, it's not hard to see that investing in a company makes it easier for it to make new jobs. They often need capital to do this.
However with new technology, firms need for manual labour is declining. 
It's true that the current monetary system has problems, but how will a deflationary one solve anything?
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:25:58
It makes a market where you are rewarded for investing in others. And penalised for just sitting on your pile of cash.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:43:02
It's not about taking, it is about sharing. Captialism has been successfully because people believe that the market will be bigger tomorrow, and therefore it makes sense to lend money to others, as well as investing. This is not so easy in a deflationary market.
This is also why bitcoin is not money, it is a commodity.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:09:11
It makes it less likely to be profitable to invest. Why invest when you get 1% on you money, without any risk? I used pile of cash because putting money in the bank would be a kind of investment. 
I will grant you that it sucks that the interest rate is lower than the inflation today. Which is why putting money in the bank doesn't make sense anymore. This makes saving in funds, or buying bitcoin or gold the way to go.
But will a monetary system based on bitcoin be a good idea? I'm not so sure.
