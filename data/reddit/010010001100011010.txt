Well, I might surprise you by saying I agree with much you have written here. I think where we digress is P2P. This is essential for bitcoin to operate as a currency, a medium of exchange, as it was intended and designed. 
Core has changed the form of bitcoin to the point where it’s current form no longer represents what was designed in the white paper. First, this is important because when we define an ideal, such as a tree or a dog, we use constructs like form. We can identify a tree or dog, in part, by observing its form. A tree is shaped like a tree. A dog is shaped like a dog. Secondly, its intention/capacity. Form alone is not sufficient to identify an ideal, thus we look at an objects intention/capacity. A tree has roots that take in fluid to hydrate and sun for photosynthesis. A dog has its own nature as well. A dog  as well has its own capacity for dog things, for lack of a better term and simplicity’s sake. Thirdly, matter is the last category used to define the ideal. This is,”what is said.” That is the sound the language, if capable, used by the ideal. Again, all 3 of these things are fully described in the white paper. The white paper would be like apple’s corporate charter that details the major components of the company such as its objectives(Intention), its structure(Form) and its planned operations(Matter). What if Apple suddenly decided to no longer sell computers and decided to sell houses. That would change all 3 criteria and Apple wouldn’t be what Apple was that changed the world. It would be completely different even though it kept the name. I’ll stop here for now on this matter. 
Now, P2P (a medium of exchange) has been THE utility that has been nullified with the subsequent high fees. Core no longer considers bitcoin to encompass this utility in the traditional sense—but, solely as a settlement layer. Bitcoin is no longer money and Core agrees.

You’re not understanding.  Because there is no utility in BTC, it’s value is dependent on others buying in with the speculation that others to will continue to buy in. However, an earlier buyer can virtually extract later adopters money when he(earlier buyer) sells. Without utility such as P2P to increase/shift the demand curve, any buyer can have his funds virtually taken to varying degrees by sellers. Not through private keys, but market actions. Utility is essential. Make sense?

You guys got what you wanted. Now choke on it! BCH FTW!

Suddenly you care about Satoshi’s white paper? Hypocrite.

Or you could read the white paper that actually describes the standard... But you’d learn BTC is no longer bitcoin. LPT, just because an exchange calls something bitcoin does not mean it is bitcoin.

Agreed. It will be insane. Unfortunately, it will not be with BTC.

“But tobacco stores!”Lol. The double speak here...

No, I just know that money that isn’t useful is worth nothing; hence, BTC will be worth nothing. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Have fun.

Keep telling yourself that when it’s worth $0. Meanwhile, the real Bitcoin will change the world. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:54:30
Sorry guys. BTC is not bitcoin anymore... a name represents an idea. The idea is the white paper.

After you pay $500 in fees just to move it. Yay!

Hello! McFly! You guys wouldn’t have these issues with larger blocks.
