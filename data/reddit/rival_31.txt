Question, does circle work with addresses from Guam? I tried coin base and GU was not supported.

Should I be putting coins into cold storage? When it's in cold storage can I still spend it or do I have to take them out first. The only of bitcoin I have atm is that you can tip with them and how to purchase but other than that all the other talk on this sub I don't exactly understand.

One day I'll get into bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-06 16:51:39
I've been following bitcoin for a while back but never got into it and I felt alienated and afraid to ask questions about it for a while. Received my first tip and because of that I researched more into it and I've become more interested in it now more than ever. Being hostile towards new users can turn people away from bitcoin and I was at that point too.
