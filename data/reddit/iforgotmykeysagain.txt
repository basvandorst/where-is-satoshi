I don't understand for what purpose will every major tech company run their own cryptocurrency? 
What's the problem to which a cryptocurrency would be the solution to instead of the current system?

Man I hate 2019 websites ... ads, popups, popovers, cookie notice, privacy policy(gdpr) agreement notice, in-browser notification alert, email subscription popup, more ads, 200 word "article" saying expanding a 140 chars tweet.

Biggest threat to bitcoin would be gold backed currencies in major economies.
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:18:06
It is from Saifedean and you're right, doesn't make sense from a technical/spec based comparison of currencies (e.g usd vs btc) point of view
BUT people will favor a gold backed usd because people will always choose conveniece and path of least resistance (from a macro point of view). 
It's just that simple. 
That doesn't mean that crypto and btc will die. They will coexist and possibly serve different use cases.
So yeah, I do agree to Saifedean on this.

Does anyone know why there's so much interest for Bitcoin coming out from Africa? 
I'm looking at inflation rates and they don't seem to be the main cause (Nigeria 11.24%, Ghana 7.6% down from +9%), like it is in Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela.

what kind of impact do you think ETFs might have on Bitcoin price, longer term. 
Should rise short term (as ETFs need to buy the necessary reserve - if they haven't already). 
But longer term?

How is blockchain.com working against btc?

From my observations, 3rd position in google search suggest, youtube recommendation engine, etc. is the one the algo thinks it has the highest degree of you clicking through.
It doesn't show on pos 1 or 2 because Google believes this mind-reading like behaviour will spook people.

he's saying "*in new crypto deposits*", doesn't this mean that those investors are depositing bitcoin/other crypto and not USD?

I think this will happen after passing the ATH of $20k. They will believe bitcoin is not just a one time thing.
They will see it as proof that BTC is something of value and here to stay. 
And then the mainstream FOMO will pour in.

I wouldn't be so drastic about it. It's similar to religion and atheism. Would you ditch an old friend just because s/he's point of view on spirituality is different than yours? 
Highly doubt it.

Yeah, putting a stamp of approval on cryptos just brings more attention (and trust) to the crypto space overall. 
Should have a positive impact overall.

As others have said, part of bitcoin's success is this mysterious creator(s). 
No one to praise, no one to blame.

If you search for "bitcoin" on google trends / worldwide, you can see Nigeria as being  as the place with most interest. 
I think we can all remember the nigerian princess story. 
Beware folks, lots of well though out scams will fall upon us in the next years. They will start targeting us in every way possible. 
Don't access links from private messages. Beware of impostor accounts (reddit, twitter, fb, and so on). 
Try not to keep your wallet on a computer connected to the internet.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:48:09
that's a lotta fees you're paying. I think it would make more sense to accumulate cash and then buy at once, accumulate more, buy again, rinse repeat; especially when btc dips heavily (prolonged period of time) and people are pessimistic and afraid.

it would at today's prices (perhaps, haven't done the math).
I don't know what the price of BTC should be for miners to be profitable but I would assume at least 2x ($20.000) at the next halving.

I can't help but notice how outdated, greedy and corrupt this current system is.

I am definitely not from IRS. Oh how much I hate those hard working patriots.
@_date: 2019-06-14 08:27:16
I didn't conclude anything. 
The context is "mass adoption". This is what FB promises with their new coin/money. 
Which in turn will also extend the attention to the rest of the crypto space (I presume). 
Which means that the main conversation around this new money subject might be of a "one vs other" type, which renders the other cryptos as insignificant to consumers (again, mainstream).
@_date: 2019-06-11 08:38:31
Seems like fake news. I'm not saying the ECB won't do that but the article has no credibility and the site as a whole is not credible as well.

Facebook has too big a footprint to not pull this off. 
Don't get me wrong, i hate fb and i think the libra is crap, but if the new coin manages to solve a problem people have, a problem that a not so obvious now but will pop out once the service is fully operational. 
I'm looking forward to seeing what fb users will decide to do with it. 
I'm not worried about Bitcoin at all. I don't really see how fb libra would be a threat to BTC. Wuite the opposite, conversations will be in a iPhone vs samsung/xbox vs playstation manner. 
Good for btc. Bad for other cryptos. 
But as a store of value? No way. 
What about privacy? Well, right now it looks like fb people care little about it. 
We'll see.
@_date: 2019-06-14 04:46:20
We might enter a "xbox vs playstation" phase where bitcoin and facebook's libra will dominate the conversations and cause other cryptos to basically die. 
Remains to be seen.

He's not. He's actually acting very responsibly. 
He is a somewhat famous investor (shark tank) speaking in public. He will never say or endorse, in public, a risky asset like Bitcoin because 
1. He doesn't want people listening to pour their money or, even worse, put debt into this thing and
2. If he would endorse it in any way and btc would go downhill, he will be forever remembered as the douche that "made me lose xxx dollars". 
TV talk is one thing.
Private talk is another. 
And actions speak for themselves.
