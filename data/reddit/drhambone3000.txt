I wouldn’t go as far as saying the market is stupid.

Additionally, BTC isn’t a currency. It’s a security, and it’s sole value is derived from speculators purchasing it with fiat currency in the hopes it will appreciate in value. BTC will never be a currency.

If you don’t mind me asking - are you investing in BTC to make money?

To each his own. For me, I prefer my having some ownership of a business through stock or index funds. I trade a little forex too for some fun speculation with the assumption that it’s highly risky.

Good luck. If you’re interested in investing there’s many avenues other than BTC - stocks, ETFs, bonds, options, forex. I recommend that you check out r/investing if you haven’t already.

Trading BTC for an item doesn’t make it a currency. BTC’s value is derived from fiat currency. Without fiat currency BTC would have no value. The USD for example has value because it is backed by the United States and its economy. BTC is not a currency imo, it’s just a speculative asset that folks are throwing fiat currency into in hopes it accruing value (worth more fiat currency).

Same backing as any asset- what someone is willing to pay (fiat currency) for it. BTC is essentially equivalent to gold. Not trying to be argumentative or anything. Just hoping to shed some light on the state of BTC and help folks make informed decisions. Not that I’m by any means an expert. But it’s a bummer to watch people throw tons of their hard earned savings into such a highly speculative asset that could honestly really burn them. Early adopters of BTC made incredible returns, and kudos to them for getting involved early.  I really mean that. However, that kind of growth at this point is quite frankly impossible. If you’re happy with the risk you’re taking by investing in BTC and being part the community that’s great. Just be aware it’s an asset, and it’s value could drop substantially.
