That makes sense in any situation where the buyer has a limited amount of money. My question is based on, let's say the American government where they are already borrowing and creating large sums of money.
If they just wanted to either a, make sure bitcoin fails, they could try to own most of it, or, b, make sure if it does succeed they have maybe over half of it, they sacrifice short term loss for long term gain and control.

That's kinda of my whole point. As they own more, the price goes up, yet they are still just creating money, to but bitcoins. They will now hold lots of Bitcoin that had increased in value, while still being able to create more Fiat that maybe it's losing some value, they can essentially do that until their own currency is worthless but have lots of Bitcoin that is worth way more than when they started.

I really appreciate the thought out reply. When I said all I really meant a large portion. Even if 1 govt controlled 1/4th of Bitcoin that would be a huge amount of power. If they were smart they wouldn't do it all at once but would have started months ago with the plan to do it over the next year.
 I'm going to re read your post again, but it seems like what you are saying makes sense, a total takeover would not be possible but I think a partial take over would make whichever county that did it the richest country unless Bitcoin fails. Obviously my theory is not perfectly thought out but I think it would it would work at least partially.

As they tried to buy the price would increase and wouldn't the people who are doing this to make money and not hodl start selling too? I'm not saying they could get all of it but it seems like they could use their imaginary money to get a large percentage

I'm asking that as well. The amount of money in comparison to what already exists wouldn't be that much to buy a huge portion of the Bitcoin market right now. How many trillion does the US control? How much is all Bitcoin worth today? If they didn't buy it all at once the price might not rise that much.

I'm not saying I understand it. The point is if Bitcoin is the new currency, why would it matter? If one of those countries you named had converted to Bitcoin before their currency lost all value, would it have mattered? They could convert it to a currency that is still stable.
Edit: what I meant I understands is that the used currency might inflate, but it shouldn't matter if now they are only using Bitcoin.

Yeah for a small country, I agree, what about for one who already controls enough money to buy all Bitcoin at current price?
@_date: 2019-08-30 06:17:50
Maybe so but you are also assuming none of them sell once the price does go up to extreme levels, and which currency are they transferring into. Owning all Bitcoin would advantage no one anyway because no one would spend it. 
Early adopters would be at a win, I'm not disputing that. But in the world stage, the first government to invest at the cost of their own currency could be major winners.
Could buying an extreme amount as a government increase chances that if it does workout you already have a huge cache of it stored away?

I'm just worried that it might work if someone with enough money thought to try to control it. It's such a gamble no one understands this Bitcoin thing for real and anyone who thinks they do is delusional. It's all speculation. At least some of the other coins have a purpose, Bitcoin is just a waste of electricity that caught on.

Yeah I understand inflation of the Fiat that gets used. My whole concept is that if they believed in Bitcoin it wouldn't matter if their main currency failed if Bitcoin is the future. They would hold the keys to the future to sacrifice their old currency.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:10:47
But if they are using money they create from this air, would it not at least allow a large portion to be bought up and inflate the price artificially?
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:13:39
Right, not at the current market price, but as they gain more percent of ownership and the price is rising, they are in turn gaining more money than they are losing at some point? Also I'm still going off the fact that their Fiat can be created in nearly unlimited supply even as it deflates they are getting Bitcoin which could potentially become the main currency one day.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:11:34
So the hodlers would hold but anyone just trying to make money would sell as the price rises would they not?
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:05:10
This makes the most sense.

Thanks for all the info. I've been thinking about Bitcoin a lot lately and this post is just one thought I came up that I played with in my head and I was hoping to get some good opinions like yours. I will definitely look through your posts at some point because you seem to have thought about it a lot as well.
