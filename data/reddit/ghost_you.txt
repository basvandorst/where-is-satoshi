I couldn't care less what coinbase does. I already stopped using them. Let them fall by the wayside. If they don't want to give the customers what they want then they have already failed.

Not when we pay their salary. They are just our employees and they can't afford to screw around with their paycheck.

He also said:
"I started the thread to provide BCash folks fair warning: large companies like ours have real use-cases in dev that would obliterate chains like BCash. Their refusal to implement SegWit/LN is one of many reasons they will not be included in the largest ever use of a public chain."

How so? If your Bitcoin is on an exchange it is already in a "not trustless" situation. You're trusting a 3rd party with your bitcoins. What other means are not trustless?

More like how long until centralized exchanges are irrelevant.

But what kind of metal? Steel? Can you engrave on steel easily? Do you think it could rust or corrode so bad you couldn't figure out the words? Am I being paranoid? Been thinking of doing this. Paper isn't that safe.

Bitstamp supports BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC.........................and bcash. Transferred all my Bitcoin from gdax to bitstamp for free and took about 4 mins. Bitstamp also fully supports segwit and batching of transactions. Winning!

Yes i know about leaving it on an exchange. Currently trying to purchase things that will be helping with this. And I can send the bitcoin directly to purse.io from an exchange?

I think it took me 3 days to get verified on Gemini. It may depend on where you live?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:02:07
It says sold out. I thought they have been sold out for a while now
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:23:34
This post is garbage. You should definitely sell all your Bitcoin.

I am. Just trying to think of all worst case scenarios. Thank you!

This has me dying

Are you sure? I thought it was not trusting a 3rd party to send your funds for you whether it's your bank or PayPal. I thought it was about removing the middleman. If I sent you 1 btc why would you need to trust me? You either get the 1 btc or not. All you have to do is trust the Blockchain which is immutable.

Yeah I guess since every state has their own rules/laws Gemini may have to jump through extra legal hoops to get you verified. The fact that gdax doesn't accept your state may mean that they (gdax) doesn't want to be bothered by all the extra stuff they have to do to get you verified even though it is technically legal and possible for them to verify you. You may want to ask around specifically about your state and see if anyone from MN has gotten verified and where and how long it took. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:34:25
When will they have more?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:04:47
I'd probably get one of these if they accepted bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:51:03
On bitmain?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:04:15
It says shipping last week of February :(

All this is trying to say is that most value is transferred in only a "few" transactions while the majority of transactions account for "very little" value. So transacting directly on the Blockchain will be low volume/high value transactions while transacting on the lightning network will be high volume/low value transactions.  I realize this isn't a perfect analogy and the images aren't to scale but the numbers are right there. It's just to give you an idea of how the transaction volume and value relationship are inverse.
The more value the less volume = Directly on blockchain
The less value the more volume = Lightning network

Can you imagine if a huge corporation like visa made some kind of payment system? We'd be screwed. Lol. Not sure the op understands what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:04:39
Ok. Maybe I don't understand. But I feel like it's trustless or nothing. If your trusting a 3rd party with your bitcoin, what they do with that bitcoin is irrelevant as long as they give it back when you ask for it. I'll also just add the purpose of bitcoin is to be transacted on the bitcoin network. It's purpose is not to be traded on an exchange. We shouldn't really ever give our bitcoin to 3rd parties. I do find your post interesting and informative :)  I'm not trying to hate or anything

You can already get free instant transactions from PayPal. If all you want is free instant transactions there is no need for cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are valued because you don't have to trust for profit companies like PayPal or coinbase who can at any time deprive you of your funds.

If you lose the 2FA app on your phone (by getting a new phone) and you don't have the key to restore it on your new phone, you have effectively lost all the money in all accounts you have a 2FA connected to. If coinbase can get it back for you, you should thank them...and I'm no fan of coinbase.

Windows will probably quarantine bitcoin-qt and you won't be able to use it
