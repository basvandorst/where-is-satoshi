Two words that are Bitcoins biggest advantage over fiat : Capital controls.

Use other cryptos such as Litecoin for smaller transactions! Need to stop thinking of other cryptos as threats to Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:52:38
Of course you have, it's based on that concept.. Although I think the advertising platform works better with bitcoin than with a single country's currency.

Buyers. It's sellers that benefit from Chargebacks being impossible!

He does a good job when he explains the technology and the possibilities. When I'm explaining bitcoin to people, I say it's like email but rather than a message, your sending money. And it's going direct from me to the recipient.

Might have worked better if they said 0.0034BTC could buy someone a meal.. Donate what you can!
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:18:35
Be curious to know what this works out at?
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:25:30
What is the most common reaction when you ask do you accept bitcoin? How many people have you successfully managed to convince?
@_date: 2014-07-05 07:16:48
Perhaps dumber than very dumb
@_date: 2014-12-21 10:20:05
People jump to conclusions about new things without properly looking into it or trying it themselves, it's lazy more than anything, we're still used to being told what to think!

I went into the chat support,
 Donal 	
Why is it available to US customers but not customers in the UK?
 20:46:35 BST   	 Agent 	 Amit_Kumar_Sharday 	
we do not have it as of now however would be available in near future
 20:47:45 BST   	 Agent 	 Amit_Kumar_Sharday 	
you may rather pay using paypal as well
 20:48:00 BST   	 Agent 	 Amit_Kumar_Sharday 	
May I ask how soon are you planning to purchase ?
 20:49:21 BST   	 Customer 	 Donal 	
I was tempted to make a few purchases having heard the news that dell.com is accepting bitcoin, but I will wait until this is available to UK customers
 20:49:55 BST   	 Agent 	 Amit_Kumar_Sharday 	
May i email you once we will have such options ?
 20:50:50 BST   	 Customer 	 Donal 	
Yea, that'd be great

By that logic, anything that is traded is a Ponzi scheme.

I sent yahoo finance feedback today to ask for this! Probably a coincidence, but pretty fucking epic!
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:20:07
Not living solely on Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:19:20
There is going to be a bitcoin blog on the side that will hopefully add value. If it can be done for dollars, why not bitcoin? 
Having one place people can go to get the best sites that bitcoin has to offer will hopefully benefit the network.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:23:16
I'd say it probably is lol 
I'd be fairly confident once this change is made in 3yrs time, it'll signal the end for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:53:17
Out of curiosity, did you replace the bitcoins after the purchase?
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:22:20
It was a joke, you aren't gentlemen!
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:00:42
Why they only accepting in the Us then?!
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:57:01
This is great, I find when explaining bitcoin to anyone that has travelled or sends money across the world that they get the need for it. They are the people cryto-currencies should be targeting first
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:16:42
0.1BTC = 50 pixels

You're the victim of a Ponzi and ya don't even know it. The government are just printing money, there's no underlying assets to back that up. It's the government deriving profit from this Ponzi

How much fees? Btc/stg rate all said and done through circle?
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:33:17
Anyone outside the US, please request bitcoin as a payment method through their chat support 
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:39:27
Can confirm. Litecoin hodler here. Also part of the advantage of second mover that headlines related to initial volatility aren't as prominent 
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:46:44
You have to send one BTC to a secret address for verification. Luckily, I know this address..
Keep it to yourself please!
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:26:39
Exactly, effectively the donators donated money to community, to say only the donators have a say is ridiculous!
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:44:55
In the UK (and EU), the treatment depends on the nature of the transaction. As I understand it, as this would be income, you would be liable to income tax on the value of the bitcoins on the day you received them. If the value was then to go up, this increase would be a capital gain.
I doubt you receiving bitcoins in Israel would have to worry about paying taxes in the US?
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:54:10
I actually contacted yahoo finance today to ask them for this 😃 class!!
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:43:01
Why do the clients not have an address book function like an email client? We should be adding extra functions to make it more user friendly.. outlook has calandar, tasks, contacts etc when it's primary function is to send e-mails
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:23:52
In order words, don't ask him anything.
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:06:23
If bitcoin is napster, the smart money is on litecoin and other crypto's. Bitcoin has to jump through all the hurdles and challenges similar to Napster. Talk of regulation seems to be directly at Bitcoin. Also not comfortable with the bitcoin holdings of individuals,10% of Bitcoin is owned by Satoshi, 1% by Winklevosses, not to mention DPR unseized and the FBI's seized bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:14:20
Agree but still ya can't get complacent, no matter how long you've been in business
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:58:46
There is a direct monetary incentive to protect bitcoin.. hard to see someone/group who has invested in the required hardware to control 51% hash-power wants to see the network lose integrity, which would have a direct monetary effect on their investment. Danger is if a rogue pool operator or hacker who didn't make this investment manages to hack into the pool
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:24:40
The dollar is more like a Ponzi scheme, where they just print more and more. Money created out of thin air.
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:10:52
I contacted the Disaster emergency committee today re: accepting bitcoin for their Gaza appeal, an ideal candidate for bitcoin, got an encouraging response..perhaps a good target for the bitcoinbandwagon..

@_date: 2014-06-26 22:34:20
It does come across that a lot of people that are holding a position in bitcoins dnt want to buy stuff as it reduces their holding.. They dnt seem to remember they can replace at spot, bitcoins out, bitcoins in
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:15:57
I find best way to explain it is to compare it to e-mails, it's like sending money like you'd send an e-mail message. Send it anywhere in the world, more or less instantly, tiny fees. 
You download a wallet which allows you send it, like an email client such as outlook allows you to send e-mails
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:41:25
She has more confidence in bitcoin than in your marriage. just saying 
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:07:12
I see the point you're making but as soon as they have 51%, the spotlight would be on them, and I wouldn't think the problem would that less immediate and more distant that they could extract their profit before Bitcoin significantly drops in value? Bitcoin's only worth what the community as a whole values it's function. If the function of Bitcoin loses it's integrity, it quickly becomes worthless

So you think Bill gates to going to buy a few hundred bitcoins here and there to keep the price down? I can just see him on localbitcoins meeting up lol

Nope, a uk debit card will work.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:06:11
I believe I have accomplished this.. HTTPS:// .. By paying $1 it submits data to a database. This code can be transferred over to allow a subsequent  action I.e if a amount is received, raise toll gate, vending machine or any other programmable event.
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:53:15
We have evidence that suggests otherwise..
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:34:05
I use circle.com with a debit card, by far the easiest. Bitbargain.co.uk is also decent 
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:11:25
If bill gates was buying, you'd know he was buying

I think the next failure with be Fiat related however because of how they chose to deal with the 08 crash, bailouts/QE, government debt and zero interest rates just kicked the can down the road. They actually can't meaningfully raise interest rates,

I've developed a site that only allows users to submit content once they have paid a micro fee. New content replaces old content. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 20:30:27
Well the tipping mechanism would work to sort the content, so good content would receive tips and feature more prominently  on the site.
The idea is to have quality content that is funded through micro-payments rather than ad revenue
@_date: 2015-09-06 20:41:56
The idea would be that it's a platform funded by micro payments rather than ads. A good post might receive tips from other users and also traffic to their link
@_date: 2015-09-06 17:56:37
Fair point, I'm going to introduce a tipping mechanism so visitors can reward good content
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:49:55
But no one is arguing that should Bitcoin collapse an altcoin will prosper. But if Bitcoin succeeds, it's hard to believe that there will only be one decentralized currency worth using.

The main issue is that the obvious efficiencies are for the merchant rather than the consumer. We're pretty much relying on the merchant to pass these on to the consumer.
