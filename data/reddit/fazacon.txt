Where are these "countless auctions sites you speak"? The only significant Ebay competition  was Yahoo Auctions, which was wrought with fraud, lasted a few years then died.
NO ONE will trust an auction site unless it has a reputable seller feedback system and strong fraud protection, and Ebay is the only site to have such a system that's been time tested and established. Not to mention, Ebay has the most convenient payment system, most well known name, most heavily trafficked site, and the most convenient shipping tools. Also, only on Ebay can you safely sell internationally without fear of getting ripped off.
I hate paying Ebay fees, but you do get a wildly popular and trusted site to sell on, and some of the most convenient shipping and payment tools available on the web.

and that's exactly what the CIA wants you to do.

Pirated copies not only are susceptible to CIA hacks, but you get the added hacks by all the neckbeards that scripted their own little backdoors into the OS that activate your webcam and microphone so they can record you humping chicken carcasses.
I'd rather have the CIA hack me, at least they want to keep their procured content private, while the neckbeard hackers will be posting what they get everywhere.

(╯︵╰,) I was so late to the game. I eventually became aware of BTC when it spiked to about 3-400 bucks. At that point I felt it was pointless to mine, and too risky to invest. Oh well.  My foresight was always shit.

So, if I bought 1000 bitcoins in 2012 at $10 per coin, today, that $10K investment would be worth 3 million, only 5 years later?
