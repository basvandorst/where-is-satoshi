So your next ransom will be for 3.1 BTC, and after you pay it they'll ask for another 5.6 BTC (total of 104 400 GBP), seeing that you tend to over-provision when asked for a ransom.

Good luck with your altcoin.

A good example of phishing is when Adam Back advertised that other fork coin, and its web wallet asked you to enter your private key or seed in order to claim the coins, but it actually collected that private data and they stole people's BTC.

The metric system. So controversial these days. At least on certain Bitcoin forums.

I think you are right. Here's a case of actual phishing (see how the offending website is copied from the original and asks for donations on different addresses and the software is actually a backdoor):

One case which falls squarely in the definition of phishing is when Adam Back advertised that other fork coin **project**^1, and its web wallet asked you to enter your private key or seed in order to claim the coins, but it actually collected that private data and they stole people's BTC.
Edit: ^1 Adam Back did not advertise *buying* the coin, and said he wanted people to *sell* it. I'm clarifying that what he advertised is the software *project* itself, which turned out to incorporate malicious wallets stealing the *bitcoins* and fork coins of people who tried to claim their fork coins.

It is passing off, like what some of the uasf people did (e.g. [this]( isn't it? They are all misrepresenting one cryptocurrency as another.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:40:29
In my opinion the definition of phishing has to accomodate the Bitcoin payment methods which don't involve entering private information on a website. A fake website might try to steal bitcoins by displaying a different address, like in the website discussed [here]( If you don't agree that the word phishing should include this kind of scam, then what other word should we use to describe it specifically (more specific than just "scam")?

People hadn't heard of that coin until he started talking about it repeatedly as a legitimate project. "turned out to have"? Some of the malicious wallets happened to be THE official full node software on their official github, and a web wallet endorsed on their official website. Saying "sell this shitcoin" implies "use those wallets". You can't normally sell them without going through one of their wallets. It is an endorsement. Adam Back effectively did their PR.

I absolutely agree. Here are some more cases of people doing the same kind of deception:

I absolutely agree that this is unacceptable. It is deception. Let us not let them get away with it. Here's an even worse case of phishing:

He said he wanted people to sell it. So he basically directed them to the wallets which stole bitcoins.
The scam wallets were advertised right on their official website and github.

Another example is [this]( though it didn't directly collect data. The offending website is a copy of the original and asks for "donations" on different addresses and the software is actually a backdoor.

Wow, that escalated quickly. So you started this post, and then two hours later the 1-year marriage already broke down. I wonder what could have happened within those two hours before your edit. Perhaps she came across a particular reddit post.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:31:44
Right. It does leave space for at least 4 more odd-shaped companies to compete and plug the hole.

You are calling manipulation of social media "good marketing" and "not sinful"? It is dishonesty! Fake votes for visibility and shills pretending to trust them is dishonest. And honesty is exactly the thing that matters for trusting a company with your money. You saying that manipulation of social media is "good marketing" and "not sinful" shows that you are dishonest too.
You can just change the links to archive.fo or archive.is and they work.

Yeah, but these guys here will tell you shit like the metric system is the devil and "there is only one true Imperial system" or whatever. And before you know it they'll try to sell you a knockoff Bitcoin, or a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:10:51
Good luck with your new shitcoin.
