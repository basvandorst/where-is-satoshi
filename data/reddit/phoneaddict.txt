Dribble of the highest order. Those in power will lose if bitcoin takes over. You really think they'll let that happen without a fight?

A deflationary currency will never work. It's a joke if you look at it that way. It's a good money making opportunity in the meantime.

This is true, outlawing something doesn't mean it vanishes. However, where do you see the valuation in an illegal currency? I would reckon it would be quite low, since the value of bitcoin is fundamentally tied to what a person can purchase with it.

What? Why the hell would they buy Bitcoins? Countries would no longer be able to alter monetary value.

Why spend something today if you believe the value will be higher tomorrow?

Let's pretend for a second that bitcoin rules the world. 21 million total coins EVER. Deflationary currency. Why spend spend/use/build with coins today when they would be worth more tomorrow? Someone provide a logical and informed post why:
1. Governments will not crush bitcoin
2. Deflationary currency is good for the economy of a country

No, it doesn't. Bitcoin is essentially a non-violent coup and will be put down. Don't believe me? Ask yourself the question: If I was in charge of the Fed, would I simply just let something else take over?

Does it matter?
Ask yourself this question: Who is in support of bitcoin? Would the government be? Would large corporations be? 
These entities have nothing to gain but everything to lose with bitcoins. Assuming widespread adoption starts to take place, there will be government intervention and a whole lot of crying.

If you truly don't know what treason is, then Bitcoin is probably the least of your concern
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:06:50
Right.....I'll let you in on a little secret. Central banks in EVERY country and the people in charge of those countries want the power to manipulate currency, such as during the last 6 years. They will never give up this power.

People use drugs because they deliver something that nothing else can. There are no substitutes. Bitcoin has many substitutes. In addition, if it's declared illegal, the number of investors would plummet--risk would be even higher than it is now. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:32:55
I thought about that, but drugs are eventually consumed by the end users. Bitcoin is just transferred. If it was illegal, why would you bother trying to use bitcoin instead of cash? I understand that there are only a set number of coins (ever) and so inflation is essentially controlled--but the appeal to have something immune to inflation only matters in the long run--so ordinary users (those using it to pay in the very near future) wouldn't care.

Bitcoin is treason.

oh I don't think it will affect any normal users. All the government has to do is outlaw accepting bitcoin by vendors
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:43:01
World output drops. Productivity declines to new lows and unemployment reaches 30%. Riots in the streets. No one wants to spend any bitcoin due to the deflationary aspect.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:38:54
It's funny you mention this. The fixed number of coins is seen by the community as a good thing, yet it's the number one flaw as to why bitcoin will never be taken seriously. Sort of a catch 22 if you will.

First off, I have no skin the game. I do not own, use or have any vested interest in the value of bitcoins. As of this post, the value of a bitcoin is about 90 bucks usd. 
In my opinion, once a certain threshold is reached, world governments will declare bitcoin illegal. It will be over at that point. Will an extreme small amount of people use it for illegal transactions? Sure, but if normal businesses cannot accept it, bitcoins are essentially worthless. 
Why would they declare it illegal? They have everything to lose and nothing to gain. While I like the idea of bitcoin, I believe it will not last much longer. 
There's going to be a whole lot of people hurt the longer this goes on, IMO.
Edit: this whole situation sorta remind me of the online poker debacle
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:13:13
You have no idea what you're talking about. Fiat is an inflationary currency. Inflation drives investment. Bitcoin is deflationary by nature, and as such will fail.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:20:29
Oh cool, was looking for an article like that. Hmmmmm, comparing bitcoin to the prohibition. While in theory that sounds like a good argument, I'm not convinced the same scenario would play out. I can't quite articulate why I think it's a flawed analogy, just that alcohol's adoption rate was much much higher than bitcoin, and that there were no substitutes. I think that trying to legislate morality is different than straight government financial oversight. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:11:26
The government doesn't need to do anything but declare that vendors/companies cannot accept bitcoin. Boom, game over.
Will bitcoin "survive" after that? Sure. Will it amount to anything worthwhile? I sincerely doubt that.

It's the result of hyper deflation. Everyone is hoarding their coins
