“You shall not eat anything which dies of itself. You may give it to the alien who is in your town, so that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.” – Deuteronomy 14:21
I think this applies perfectly to bible quotes taken out of context and applied to anachronistic circumstances. ��

Preach, brother. Preach!

I consider myself a strong progressive, and I’m a huge believer in BTC as well as the crypto space in general. It’s pretty clear why libertarians like bitcoin, so no need to recap that. However, while I might disagree with a libertarian on healthcare, where I tend to agree with them is the absolute insanity of the monetary policy that has been put in place by both democrats and republicans over the past several decades.
I think that, more generally, the some on the left may be more drawn to the tech side of the crypto space, while those on the right more drawn to the economic philosophy of bitcoin. That’s and over simplification, admittedly, but may explain some trends. 
Having said all that, while there maybe a few more libertarians drawn to crypto than progressives, I think both represent a very thin segment of the “right” and “left”.  The majority of people on both sides get the bulk of their opinions from media outlets that are essentially propaganda machines for the various business interest groups, none of which want to see the Fed and multinational banks lose money and power. So in short, the majority of the “left” and the “right” are anti-bitcoin, simply because that’s what they’re told to think.

 Psychologically, it’s more painful to watch your investment take off without you, than to watch your investment depreciate. So most people hold, even if they know the market is going down because they’re more afraid of missing the low probability “moon” than they are of holding through the higher probability slow bleed.
 Timing the market is very difficult and requires much more attention even for the experienced. So most people don’t want to put in the effort and energy, and even when they do they often get it wrong, which tends to make people very hesitant to try again.
I see the pros and cons of both sides, honestly. I think it basically comes down to an individual combination of factors for each person, such as pain tolerance, risk aversion, and available resources. 
To each their own.

Was dead broke. In hindsight of course I can think of a dozen ways I could have avoided selling, but at the time it seemed like I needed to do it. Live and learn. ��

That sucks man. Probably won’t make you feel any better but I had 15 ETH late in 2016, then hit very hard financial times, and had to sell every thing and cash in on all my savings. Sold the ETH for $7. Got caught up with life and stopped paying attention to crypto for about 9 months. Finally, in Nov 2017, decided to check what my ETH would have been worth. You know how that went lol. Wanted to punch myself right in the dick for selling. Such is life. You just dust yourself off and do your best to move forward. Good luck!

TA is a tool. And like any other tool some people are more or less skilled in its use. There’s a lot of TA bashing in crypto. I can tell you this. I got into the market in Jan, pretty much the worse time and got my ass kicked for 2 months. TA helped me to start making money without shorting and in a bear market. Specifically, using RSI divergence to help identify trend reversals, buying dips and selling peaks. I’m still in the red but I’ve managed to significantly increase my number of coins and turn what would have been losses if I just held into gains. Just my personal experience.

It’s just more FUD. Price action is due to speculators shorting, rather than true selling. Over 1000 new short orders on bitfinex in last hour. Fine with me, just setting up another short squeeze.

I suppose only time will tell how much is luck and how much is using TA to skew probabilities in my favor. No question, that the majority of people who post TA are basically full of crap and it’s no better than  flipping a coin. I can only speak to my experience, which is obviously anecdotal. I will say this, the last few months have given me a lot of practice on identifying when BTC is about to take a heavy fall lol. The last 4 big drops I’ve been able to identify and tether up, then get back in before the next upswing, with moderately tight stoploss orders in case I called the bottom prematurely. Last night for example, there was a pretty clear RSI divergence on multiple time frames, with price moving up while RSI was going down. Sold 1/3 of the portfolio a few hours before the drop then bought back in at a cheaper price this afternoon. I’m not saying it’s going to work every time but so far it’s been a much better strategy for me than just holding 100% of my portfolio. If I were filthy rich I’d just DCA and buy on every dip, but I already used all the money I could afford to lose by the end of Feb. So I had to find another solution. I’d say my strategy is generally 2/3 hodl, and 1/3 trade using TA to increase my total number of coins. So far it’s going fairly well. Maybe I’ll have a different story in a few months.
