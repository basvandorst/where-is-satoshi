I’ve ordered a tenx card to do the exact same thing.  I loaded my account up with £400 of bitcoin a wk ago.  It’s now worth £465.  My card hasn’t even arrived yet!! Have you looked into Monaco? Same kind of thing but if you lock in some Monaco you get a % of crypto cash back on top.  I’ve ordered both to keep my options open.

That’s what I was thinking.  I don’t mind waiting a few wks if my balance increases in fiat.  Should only be a few wks if your in the EU.  Maybe a bit more with Christmas and the new yr.

I’m really looking forward to the Monaco cards being released.  I bought 50 Monaco so I could get the ruby red 1 with the cash back and higher spending limits.  I’ve not heard of the xapo 1.  I’ll have to have a google on that haha.

Download the revolt app, load it with gbp, concert it to euro and send it to coinbase.   Buy btc from coinbase pro to save on fees.  Literally takes about 3hrs on a week day.

My mistake.  My balance has increased ��.

I use the nano LedgerX at home for the majority of my crypto then the cool wallet s for a portable off line wallet.  It’s so small and looks exactly like a credit card.

I’ve had the same email. It’s from no-reply  It’s a different email than they normally send from.  Luckily I looked at the app to confirm the limit increase which isn’t there.

The keep key is nice.  Ledger has a wider range of coins though.

I’ve been contemplating getting a keepkey too.  It’s just lovely looking wallet with the added extra of shapeshift built in. I just hate wasting money and I’m unsure what benefit having too wallets will bring.

Just to clarify, does this mean you can only withdraw fiat if you have an American or Philippines back account? What about an American dollar revolut account? Thanks.

A huge discount would be nice.  There’s no way I can justify another wallet when one hold it all anyway.  Shame, I really fancy the keep key..... maybe when I’m a millionaire ��.
