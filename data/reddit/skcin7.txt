I've used ShapeShift in the past no problems. I just attempted to convert an altcoin I was holding into Bitcoin and it failed. It was only like $300 worth of value but I mean that's still a decent chunk of money. So now I'm looking into solutions to get it back.

What OS does it have running on it?

It will be like eBay, except not eBay, and will have similarities of Facebook, but it wont be Facebook...

Something seems fishy about this.... do you think Dotcom may be behind this as a publicity stunt?

Maybe they made a physical print copy to help combat piracy, since we'd all probably just copy the magazine throughout the Internet.

What is it?

Is that DOS? So they have some version of Windows running on them?

Is all that Bitcoin is mentioned in this entire video? I really would rather not watch an entire ~hour long video for this tiny insignificant exchange about Bitcoin.

Thanks for answering my question instead of the assholes that downvoted me.

Good job, it definitely looks like a magazine I would be interested in.
I think that given that nature of what this magazine is about, a digital e-zine copy might be a better route to go. You wouldn't have to worry about printing costs, all your readers are already digitally adept, and it would be easier to manage/distribute (both for you and your readers).
Just an idea. Out of curiosity why not go with the e-zine?

All you have to do is press a button.

I think you're right.

Wow that guy is an idiot. The Internet is a series of tubes!

Well, Google Checkout is still a bazillion times better than Paypal, from the standpoint of ethics, but Bitcoin is paramount.
