Apple are supposed to vet all apps before allowing them to be listed in the app store, how is part of that process not to check if an app with the same name, look etc does not already exist and the new app is not a scam product. 
I would think there would be a reasonable case for OP's friend to contact Apple about this and ask for compensation, somebody hasn't done their job properly.

Transaction volume on monero will be quite low as it is not that heavily used, if DNM usage grows, then transaction linkability on size of transaction/split of coins etc will be much harder to trace.  With coinjoin, you could end up with dirty coins even just mixing for your own financial privacy and no ties to DNM's, with Monero you shouldn't have that problem.
I'm really interested to see where the project goes.
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:44:33


So you don't know Monero but you're pretty sure it isn't perfect....maybe read up on something before posting about it next time.
Of course it isn't perfect (Is anything just yet in crypto space?) it is only 2.5 years old, isn't a clone of BTC code as so many other alt's are, it has mixing at the protocol level and yes there is a block explorer, but try and link any transaction back to the original sender if you can.
I think what was trying to say is that when you receive coins, you can't link them back to the sender, so in a way the coins certainly don't have any prior history.
[This]( against [this]( is a great example of anonymity with Monero against Bitcoin.
There can't just be one crypto, there should be multiple that make it and each have different properties and use cases.  Diversity.

This pops up every now and then from the fear mongers, and as per the top comment in this thread:


@_date: 2016-04-09 12:29:24
The 'top talent' could continue development on the new chain if there was a hard fork, nothing stopping them adding the changes in to core and continuing working on solutions. Them saying they would quit is the same as hearns rage quit. Childish IMHO. 
Proposals started out at 8mb, with no agreement from most core devs, then 4mb again with no agreement from most core devs and now 2mb again with a lot of resistance from most core devs. The has been no compromise at all and we all just have to blindly follow what this group say is best. 
Personally myself I want it all, 2mb blocks, segwit, lightening network, those last two from what I have read up on take a lot of work from other software developers to upgrade all compatible programs with time and money needed to do so.
A bump to 2mb would not require nearly half as much work, would show willingness from multiple development teams to produce a completely decentralised development solution, be a fantastic test of the network in a hard fork, allow segwit to be integrated correctly over the proposed soft fork and give a lot of confidence to users, speculators and future backers. 
But no, we have the CEO flying around the world with a select group of devs campaigning for everyone to stick with the way his employees see the future of bitcoin. 
This is not what I bought in to, this is not the bitcoin I have been telling people about over the years and currently I don't mention it to anyone these days as I really don't know what will happen with this experiment.

Bulletproofs will help out with transaction size, but one of the reasons I hold Montero's is because it is a completely different code base, not a copy paste of the Bitcoin code as so many others are.
Oh and privacy by default, not opt in like all a lot of other privacy focused coins, even sidechains on BTC will have to open and close channels.

Monero has had CT from a while, monero is private at the protocol level, bitcoin isn't.

@_date: 2018-01-21 12:26:13
As I've said in a comment below, Montenegro has privacy by default, I don't think bitcoin will ever have that so that is something montero has over bitcoin.
Maybe if you never move out of a sidechain you could have privacy, but what if you do, coins will become viable again.
It isn't going to be a one coin to rule them all, putting all of your eggs in one basket is just crazy, what if there's a bug found in bitcoin and all of its clones, there's a good chance that bug won't be in monero as it is a completely different code base.

I never said open wifi and no vpn were anything to do with Apple security, their usage by people porting them around though and using open access points has. Your comment about IE points towards my view that MS products have previously been more susceptible to being knocked over, but now apple products are in the spotlight due to their increased usage. 
I have heard all of your experiences from a few apple users and I say the same thing to each of them as I did in my original post, market share and data theft, you don't steal more by targeting the few.

Over the last 2 years I've been involved with the whole digital currency movement, any time bitcoin has a dip like this alts usually have a slight rise in price. It just looks like people moving from one currency to another to buy back in at a lower price where these people have their btc on exchanges where alts are available. 
I understand your laundering theory though, but surely 500k's worth of btc would create bigger movement on the alt markets. Doge is up 300% but a move from 22 Satoshi's to 100+ hasn't been an enormous btc input. One of the more anonymous currencies monero has been in a bit of a slump of late as well with very little price movement.
Do we even have any addresses that are known to have gox coins in them?

Yeah, my solicitor has taken that information as well as my cost in time to get the place up and running again, but it's not the biggest farm in the world and more of a side hobby.
I more angry at the fact that the police must have taken no steps in actually investigating the property to see if anything illegal actually was going on, but then you know, that would require actual work on their part.  The other issue that has been pointed out to myself from my solicitor is the ease at which search warrants are signed off on.  The person signing off on the search warrant must not have asked the correct questions from the police to see if they had any actual evidence to proceed with sign off on the search warrant.
The whole thing is a farce and I would love for it to have an effect of making the police force actually use their head and investigate the case, had they done any digging and contacted the owner of the property, or as they done after their legal break and entering sat an officer outside of the property waiting for someone to turn up and ask to come in, we would have said no problem.  Instead they get battering rams out and cause damage to property and it makes them look like they haven't got 2 brain cells to rub together.
Boils my piss.

I fully agree that the war on drugs is a problem and legislation needs to be changed, but I disagree with your other points.
Contacting the property owner should be the first port of call, who is to say they are the ones growing?  The premises could just be rented out to someone who is using it as a farm without the owners knowledge.
I used my own home to start off with GPU rigs, I also run my business from home.  I have a much higher electricity usage than any other person around me due to running a few  machines from here.  Does that give the Police the right to break down my door?  I would hope not.
I know there will be a few people in the force that do their jobs thoroughly and investigate every possible angle, but a lot of them put 2 and 2 together and come up with 6.
Assumption is the mother of all fuck ups but more powers are given over to the Police and they can literally get away with murder by saying, I was just doing my job.
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:54:59
My anger is directed at the whole system.
The police present their evidence to the magistrate and they sign off on the search warrant.  The police haven't performed enough work to completely make sure that what they are doing is justified and the person signing off on the warrant has not asked for definitive proof that something illegal is going on.
No one in this situation has done their job correctly, I know this, but your first point makes it sound like you are fully for the police smashing doors down of innocent people after very little investigative work has been carried out to guarantee 100% that something illegal is going on.
And on that bombshell I'm bowing out of this convo.
@_date: 2014-09-14 15:53:23
The investigative work I would have expected from the police would have been a long the lines of:
* Find out who owns the property and try to make contact
* Check the property first for signs of a cannabis farm
A high electricity reading and possible heat signature should not be enough 'evidence' for anyone to grant a search warrant.  There is nothing blocking/covering any windows, some windows are left open venting heat and cannabis farms would most likely seal up any holes to prevent smell escaping while they funnel out heat via carbon scrubbers to chimney stacks etc.  If it were a cannabis farm, would I have let the guy wearing the G4S shirt in to the property or just politely told him to do one and when he was in the property, do you not think he would have noticed a smell had I been growing the devils lettuce in there?
The fact that this seems to hinge on the electrical meter reading and for them to smash down my doors some 7 hours later shows a complete lack of any police work here and just thugs in a uniform saying they are  doing their job.

Not everyone is a tech wiz, my old man understands what bitcoin can do but does not understand how it works under the hood completely.  By showing him a transaction from the wallet, getting the transaction ID and putting that in to blockchain.info he can see the public ledger and understand how his money was transferred and confirmed by the network.
Some people learn better by playing with technology rather than just reading about it and yes you could use testnet, but either way you are still using a wallet.

This will probably get buried but it is not only in the US where this happens, I had my operation broken in to by the Police with a search warrant for control substances, namely cannabis over here in the UK just last month.  They didn't seize any equipment but did go around unplugging everything.
They left Police officers outside of the premises over night waiting for someone to turn up which I did after noticing everything was offline in the morning.  When I arrived I thought I had been broken in to robbed but when I asked the office what had happened he just asked me to get in to the back of his car and he would explain everything.  I asked if I was under arrest for something to which he said no and although I shouldn't have got in I did.
The first words out of his mouth were, "I don't actually know what has happened here" to which I then put 2 and 2 together and said "You've broken in here thinking it was a cannabis farm haven't you" and he said that it looked that way.
After answering a few questions and explaining Bitcoin to the officer, it then took him around an hour to find someone at his HQ that knew what had happened here that night as he said the raiding party had not submitted a report on what went down.  I overheard him mention a possible digital or computer crime to which I laughed and then he said they were getting a computer forensics expert to come down and have a chat with me.  I said please do so I can get on with my day.
30 minutes later he received another call saying that they would not be sending anyone down and that they had no further questions for me, thanks.  1.5 hours in the car being made to feel like a criminal and I didn't even get a sorry for the mistake or any help with repairing and securing the premises, all I was told was I had to pay and then claim the costs back.
The only thing I can put to why they thought something illegal was going on was the day before while I was there attending to a machine, there was a knock at the door and a guy with a G4S t-shirt on asked if he could take a meter reading.  I should have asked for credentials but didn't think anything of it and said sure come in.  I'm guessing due to the electricity reading they have had to report it and 7 hours later the raiding team smashed the doors in.
I'm getting angry just writing this out as the complete lack of any investigative work has angered me greatly.  It's now in the hands of my solicitor but I very much doubt that anything will be done apart from them paying up for repair costs.  It makes for an interesting conversation piece anyway.

As I mentioned below, still no massive change in transaction confirmation times though if you used RBF and everyone else does, it could still take hours for your transaction to confirm.

So if I pay the appropriate fee at the time of send my transaction, but over the course of 10 mins other users pay a higher fee and my transaction does not get included, but the 15 minute window paying for goods through a payment processor passes, what then? 
Serious question, I'm not trying to troll etc, just wondering what would happen to my coin? The transaction has been broadcast, can I pull it back?

I wish they would stop calling it a cyber attack, it basically is just some numpty has had the privileges to be able to run an exe. Bad system management. 
Wana decrypt0r 2.0 is the infection, my missus sent me a picture as soon as she spotted it, only a $300 ransom as well. I told her her to tell the IT department I'll pay for it if they want.

If this does actually go through I will be very happy, but this will not make Bitcoin more private than Monero.
Monero is private at the protocol level by default, not opt in like dash and ZEC or on a sidechain where you would still have to close out back to Bitcoin leaving a trace.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:02:48
Pretty sure I know what a cyber attack is, this is just a shit IT implementation which the people who run the NHS have wasted millions on with companies such as Siemens.
Edit: also pretty much all files in each trust will be centralised, so most file encryption will have taken place on network shares, not every single computer in the NHS. Brings the number of ransoms needed to pay right down.

Bitcoin has been around for 8 years, who knows what else will come out in the next 8 years starting with segwit. 
Doubling the blocksize just leads to mores centralisation, I can't believe anyone who uses bitcoin can take that and say oh well. We are supposed to be moving away from middlemen and banking systems, not handing it over to them on s fucking silver platter. 
Segwit2x is not as compromise, it's a take over, plain and simple.

I'm not sure on that, from a drugs perspective anyway.
The approximate amount of dollar bills in circulation is [$1.34 Trillion](  The approximate global spend on illegal drugs is [$400 billion](
According to an [article from back in 2013]( SilkRoad and Atlantis were estimated to be processing $50 million per year.
BTC 4% - 50 million spent on illegal drugs of market cap 1.25 billion at the time that article was published.
USD 30% - 400 billion spent on illegal drugs of circulation of 1.35 trillion dollars.

So it is fine to point out the flaws with third parties that deal with bitcoin (exchanges) and say bitcoin has security flaws but if anyone takes a swipe back at banking institutions it's diverting the attention away from bitcoins flaws......riiiiight

Is the 12.5BTC block reward not enough for now...? Segwit allows more transactions for users to actually use bitcoin to pay for things, transfer value etc. 
We have years of block reward still to be mined, transaction fees are miniscule in comparison so for me that is a weak argument. 
Segwit allows 2nd layer solutions to start being worked on, who knows what someone will come up with. 
I can't believe the amount of people who are accepting wu, ver and fucking Craig Wright of all people as thinking he knows what he is talking about, the very same person who tried to claim he is satoshi.....are you fucking kidding me? 
How can people not see this a an act of taking over bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:17:06
WTF are you bumping your gums and fingers about, red herring.
The media slates bitcoin and exchanges that are knocked over by determined hackers when there actually isn't anything wrong with the bitcoin protocol but it is a chance to bash bitcoin related news.  We are talking about technology that has been around for 6 years, how long did it take banks to tighten up security from armed robbers, how much do banks spend on infrastructure and knowledgeable sys admins etc.
Please get your information right, nothing happened with bitcoin, it was the security of the exchange that was compromised, a currency exchange that allowed users to trade bitcoin and alt coins.
Bitcoins bigger problems, you asshat.

Miners secure the network, users use it and the devs push out the code. 
No one runs the network, it is supposed to be an open decentralised system, the miners are trying to take control and run it as a business, which is wrong. Their business is to secure the network and get paid for doing so.
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:52:23
Monero is 3 years old and has a very active group of devs, it is private by default, not opt in which bitcoin can never be without a hard fork. 
We might see a huge amount of improvements given the same number of years worth of development bitcoin has had, come back and see if your comments hold up then.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:32:49


Couldn't agree more, and which is why I would trust 100-200 open source developers who work on the original core branch of bitcoin then some rushed together fork of it with a paid for team of developers who are told what to do. 
I'm not happy to see segwit2x at all, the core development team roadmap has a hard fork in it, once segwit activates, once LN and other 2nd layer solutions are running and the network then needs a capacity boost but the rushed code trying to be put out will probably be riddled with bugs just like BU is and has been. 
We don't need 2mb and segwit just yet giving up to 4mb blocks, the only times the network is that crammed is when there is a shit load of spam flying around clogging the mempool, or when empty blocks are being mined with fuck all transactions being added. 
I'm all for hard forks if done correctly, I'm a big follower of monero and that has scheduled hard forks every 6 months, yes the user base its not as big which is why it works so well, rushing shit out with segwit2x is dangerous for everyone.

Gigabit networks everywhere... I live in the UK and there's not many Gbit connections outside of London for home users and what about countries that don't even have anything faster than ADSL or 56k,such as parts of Africa. Isn't this magical Internet money supposed to be for everyone? 
Think about the larger picture and not just your own country where these things might be coming to.

Haha, very true, but segwit and LN solves that problem and hopefully allows infrastructure to mature before ruling them out of using Bitcoin altogether. 
I'm in the camp that a physical blocksize does have to come eventually, just not right now and via a rushed version that will not have been tested properly or written by tried and tested devs who have been writing code for bitcoin to get it where it is today. 
Also Jihan Wu has shown his true colours and makes himself look like a teenager with the way he conducts himself, if you are happy for people like this to run the show then god help this project, it will end up being centralised and controlled by a few people and go against everything bitcoin was supposed to be.

I think everything in this post makes sense.
If enough people get in on this and back both ideas, create one group and spread out the risk and buy devices/chips from various suppliers all together.
The BFL vouchers for chips is an interesting one, I may have some available to myself (1st April order, not sure if I get them or not) but a lot of people seem to be selling those, would be cheaper to buy those in bulk and build own rigs with other chip purchasers?

I've just got off a call with paypal and they have told myself to contact my credit card provider and start a charge back as the good have not been delivered and it is outside of the 45 days.  Paypal rep said that if the card issuer starts the charge back, paypal are notified and they run the charge back on the sellers paypal account.  They said this will not have any negative effect on your own account.
I have now opened the case with my credit card company and will hopefully hear from their dispute team in the next 7-10 days.
If anyone else in the UK has gone through this process I would be interested to hear their outcome and hoops that have been jumped through to get your money back.
