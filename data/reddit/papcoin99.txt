i need an API that can do multiple  permisssion , example : api only able to generate address but cannot send money
so far only coinbase have this option , do you have other suggestion?
also need a service that can generate address with webhook
mycelium gear looks very good , but they dont allow generating per address, instead they must create order which will be different per address?

Wallets that support BIP32 pubkeys will only do a forward address lookup for a limited number of addreses. For example, if you have 20 expired, unpaid orders and someone sends you money to the address of the 21-st order, your wallet may not see that. Thus, it is important to ensure that there are no more than 20 expired orders in a row.
If you have 20 orders in a row and try to create another one, Gear will see that and will automatically reuse the keychain_id (and consequently, the address too) of the 20-th order. It will also set the 21-st order's reused field to the value of 1. You will see it marked as reused in the admin panel too.
does this mean that there can only 20 simultaneous address at a time?
how if i am going to issue permanent address to my user (which is around 15.000 users)
