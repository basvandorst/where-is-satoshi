The word "blockchain" wasn't even widely used until about 2012 (source:  ). Until then it was simply called "Bitcoin" or "Bitcoin technology". It was started being used because the banks and other big businesses needed to rebrand "Bitcoin technology" before they could start using it, because the word "Bitcoin" had (and still has) a bad reputation. The same thing happened with the Internet - the word "Internet" had a bad reputation (kinda like the word "Bitcoin" has now), so "Internet technology" was rebranded to "online technology". Lots of big businesses started developing "private internets" using "online technology", which of course had nothing to do with the Internet, and as a result one of the biggest bubbles in human history happened, and when it crashed, 90% of all companies using "online technology" went bankrupt. 
So, the word "blockchain" was simply a rebranding of "Bitcoin technology", which, I think you will agree, is "decentralized, permissionless, public database / ledger".
Around the year 2015, an attempt to change the definition of the word "blockchain" was started. You can see the (quite literal) rewriting of its meaning here:  and here: 
As Jon Matonis wrote: **There is a Wikipedia edit war now going on to remove terms "permissionless" and "bitcoin" from the blockchain entry** (source:  )
Call me paranoid, but the main reason for your post seems to continue this effort to change the meaning of the word "blockchain".

As I mentioned in my example, the rule of law enabled the banks in Cyprus and Greece to take money from everyones accounts to bailout themselves (this is called a bail-in). How was that beneficial to non professional account holders in those countries?
On a more philosophical note, when there is a recurring problem, which no one can solve, then a law is created. Therefore, every law is an unsolved problem. If all problems that humanity has would be solved, then no laws would be necessary. Almost always, a law limits freedom to improve security. It may be that a law limits freedom only a tiny bit, to improve security a lot, but if a law does not limit freedom at all (meaning it does not forbid to do something), then what is the point of such law anyway? Could you give an example of a law which does not forbid anything at all?
Regarding theft, there has not been a single theft from the Bitcoin system itself. If you have a golden coin, put that coin to a bank, and that bank gets robbed, does that mean that gold can not be trusted? In the same way, if you have some bitcoins, put those bitcoins to an exchange, and that exchange gets robbed, does that mean that Bitcoin can not be trusted? Bitcoin in this sense is like gold - if you don't hold it (the private keys which allow you to spend the bitcoins), then you don't own it.

What is your point? "anywhere a distributed consensus needs to be established in the presence of malicious or untrustworthy actors" - if there is "presence of malicious or untrustworthy actors", it means that "malicious or untrustworthy actors" can use it. If "malicious or untrustworthy actors" can use it, it means it is permissionless. You just proved my point - blockchain is a **permissionless** decentralized public database / ledger.

When email came out there was no easy alternative ways to instantaneously send **text based messages**, but there was a much easier and more convenient way to instantly send **information** - phone.
Similarly, while you can easily transfer money to a friend (only true if you both live in a first world country and are between that privileged 1 billion people with full international banking access), until Bitcoin there did not exist any way to send instantaneous payments which would be both **irreversible** and **trustless**. WHile this may not seem important to you, this was considered one of the biggest computer science challenges and was worked on for over 40 years by scientists all over the world. Bitcoin is the first payment network in existence which can send **irreversible**, **trustless** payments of **any** size to **any** country. There did not exist anything similar until Bitcoin - there was no payment network working in **all** countries (PayPal blocks access from over 60 countries, etc); there was no payment network where you could send both 0.01$ and 1000000$.
Internet was the first information transfer network which could send any kind / type / size information (before internet, you needed telegraph so transfer short text information, fax to transfer large text information and simple pictures, mail to transfer documents, phone to transfer sound information to someone specific, radio to transfer sound information to many people at once, television to transfer video information to many people at once, etc) - the Internet replaced all that with **one** global information transfer network, which enabled all the use cases listed above, and also the ones which were impossible before, for example sending video information to specific person. Of course, not all of those use cases were available instantly, but they were apparent to the ones who understood the technology of the Internet and its potential.
Bitcoin is the first value transfer network which can send any kind / type / size value, which enables many value transfer processes to be performed on the same network - not only transactions of any size to any country, but also stocks, wedding and property registrations, land titles, votes, timestamped documents, etc - all to be sent via the same global network. It also enables things which were impossible before, like "smart contracts", which are contracts enforcing themselves programmatically, without lawyers, courts, or any human intervention. Of course, not all of those use cases are available now, but they are apparent to the ones who understand the technology of Bitcoin and its potential.

Why are you using the word "blockchain", which means "decentralized, permissionless, public database / ledger" to describe what you are doing? "Private blockchain" (private public database) is an obvious oxymoron, just like "national internet" (national international network).

To reiterate what I have written in my previous replies:
In the legacy system the banks can reimburse you after theft, but to be able to do that, they must be able to control your account balance, which means they can steal your money themselves (like it happened in Cyprus and Greece). In the legacy system the banks control your money and are responsible for protecting it.
In the Bitcoin system no one can reimburse you after theft, which means no one can steal your bitcoins unless they get your private keys. In the Bitcoin system you control your own money and you are responsible for protecting it.
Some people prefer someone else to control their money and someone else to be responsible for protecting their money - those people choose to use the banks.

If you live in a first world country, and do not send or receive international payments, or travel, then currently Bitcoin will offer you no benefits.
If you live in a third world country, then Bitcoin is probably the **only** possible way for you to send and receive payments from other countries, or at least it is much cheaper than the available alternatives - about 4 billion people on the planet do not have access to a bank account (and any subproducts like credit cards, PayPal, etc); only about 1 billion people have access to full international banking.
Your question is very similar to "why should I use email?" in 1980 - 1990. Sending an email then required elaborate knowledge, special hardware, often took days instead of seconds like now, and there was almost no one who you could send an email to. It seemed, and was, not really offering any benefit and a giant hassle. No one saw it adopted anytime soon, so not many people bothered to learn how to use it. Seems familiar?
In hindsight, of course, most of the ones who learned how to use email in 1980s are now getting at least 6 figure yearly salaries. Others, like your mother, still didn't learn how to use it to this day. So the only benefit for you to be using Bitcoin now, is the same as it was for you to be using email in the 1980s - to be between those who lead, not those who follow.
If you are too young to remember how email was in the 1980s, here is a video from 1984 explaining how to send an email in just 12 easy steps:

First, you have to understand the reason why AML / KYC exist in the first place. The legacy payment systems are dependent on trust - the more you trust the person, the more you can trust the payment coming from them. To be able to trust someone, you have to know their reputation - to be able to know their reputation, you have to be able to identify them and prevent someone else from pretending to be them - to be able to identify them and prevent someone else from pretending to be them, you need AML / KYC. While AML / KYC has the advantage of making the payments safer in legacy payment systems, it has the disadvantage of introducing identity theft risk, which would not exist otherwise.
Bitcoin is the first payment system which is completely trustless (because security in Bitcoin is based on mathematical algorithms) - it does not matter if you trust someone who sending the payment or do not trust them - you can trust their payment all the same. Therefore, AML / KYC has absolutely no advantage in the Bitcoin payment system, while still having the disadvantage of introducing identity theft risk. That is why bitcoiners are against AML / KYC.
To answer your second question, while it is possible to track stolen bitcoins, it is impossible to recover them. To be able to recover them, someone would need to be able to control the system and arbitrarily alter Bitcoin balances. If it was possible for someone to alter Bitcoin balances, then the whole system would be worthless. I guess this comes down to personal choice - for some people the fact that your bank can alter your account balance seems a good thing, because that means that your bank can reimburse you after theft. For other people (for example people from Cyprus or Greece) this seems a horrible thing, because in those countries the banks took the money from everyone's accounts to reimburse the mistakes of the banks. This all comes down to a dilemma as old as the humanity itself, what do you value more - security, or freedom?

Are you that misinformed, trolling, or just deluded?
Bitcoin is on github and it literally has more different developers contributing (adding, modifying and discussing) to it than any other cryptocurrency in existence.
Core is the name of a specific implementation of the Bitcoin protocol so it doesn't even make sense to mention it in this context.
Blockstream employees' contributions make up only a small part of all Bitcoin's code, and there are companies whose employees contribute more code to Bitcoin than Blockstream (for example Chaincode Labs).
This is publicly available and easily verifiable information if you know what github is (you do) and you know how to use google (I assume you do).

"Decred has an Airdrop scheduled for next month (20 days and a few hours from now) where they’ll be giving out 4 percent of the total Decred supply to all participants."
"In an effort to create balance in the network distribution of Decred, a cryptocurrency airdrop was created for anyone who wants to participate in the development of the project. The airdrop distribution represents 4% of the total Decred supply and will be equally and unconditionally distributed to valid participants."
The fact that these 4% already exist and are in the hands of this coin's developers, means that this coin has been premined.
ELI5 of their business plan:
1. Premine x% of coins.
2. Advertise their coin as The Next Big Thing.
3. Give away a part of the premined coins to the public for free, incentivizing them to advertise this coin as well.
4. When a market value is established, sell all of the premined coins for USD.
5. Profit!

It's exactly the opposite. The vast majority (if not all) of Bitcoin exchange hacks were performed using social engineering. The best way to protect yourself against social engineering is to limit publicly available information about yourself, therefore BTC-e has the best protection against social engineering. Lots of exchanges with known owners went "pop" one day (best example Mt.Gox). The fact that exchange owners are known does not protect against hacks and thefts (how could it?), it only increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks (the method how most Bitcoin exchanges which went "pop" were hacked).

You first 3 points are completely on point (pun not intended).
The only point where I would disagree with you, is lumping together people who support SegWit2x (i.e. giving control to the miners / corporations and switching to a github repository which did not have a single commit in 34 days) and people who support raising the block size (which many of the people do support, while still supporting Core).

And the median block size of BCH for the last 200 blocks is 9860 bytes (~10 kilobytes); average block size is 46936 bytes (~47 kilobytes); i.e. the transactions on BCH would literally have the same low fees even if BCH had lowered the maximum block size to 100 kilobytes instead of raising it to 8 megabytes. What's your point? That a cryptocurrency which is not used by anyone can easily manage to have low fees?

I think the most important argument in favor of using "bits", is that 1 bit is divisible to 100 pieces (satoshis), like every other currency. This means, that it could be used in all existing software  (accounting, etc.) without the need for modifying that software in any way. This may seem small, but it actually can help the adoption immensely.

Replace "bitcoin" with any other currency, and the above statement is still true.


Correct. The same way, until one sells, those are paper losses. I don't understand why you keep insisting that losses are real, but profits are paper, when they are both paper until one sells.


No, I am not clairvoyant and no one is. By looking at the chart and averaging the price over several months (to remove anomalies / bubbles), I can see that the price has been steadily climbing for over 7 years now; but past performance does not guarantee future performance. However, looking at the Bitcoin space in general, I see no reason why the price trend should reverse: the number of Bitcoin transactions is growing, the number of Bitcoin users is growing, the number of stores accepting Bitcoin payments is growing, the Bitcoin price volatility is decreasing, the number of developers / companies creating services using the Bitcoin protocol is growing, the number of investments into those companies is growing; until any of those trends reverses, I see no reason why Bitcoin price trend should reverse (I am talking about long term trend, not day-to-day fluctuations).

Historical data shows that your assumption is wrong. The price was over 1000 USD from 2013.11.28 to 2013.12.06 - for about one week. The historical charts show that the volume during those days was actually lower than during 2013.11.04 - 2013.11.20 (when the price was in the 200 USD - 700 USD range).


Then why do you say that people who bought bitcoins for 1200 USD have lost money? Until they sold them, they haven't lost anything, no? Furthermore, as the chart I have linked above shows, Bitcoin price never even reached 1200 USD and was over 1000 USD for only about a week.


How is that different from buying and selling stocks, bonds, foreign currencies, etc?
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:15:35


Please read my previous post:  If you have invested in Bitcoin regularly over time (as any smart investor should do, when investing in anything), then regardless of whether you have invested for 5 years, for 4 years, for 3 years, for 2 years, for 1 year, for 6 months, for 3 months or for 1 months, you have made a profit.
If you invested in Bitcoin by buying when the price was high, and selling when the price was low, then you should change your investing "strategy", because such investing "strategy" (buying high, selling low) would make a person lose money regardless of what it was they were investing in (stocks, bonds, real estate, foreign currencies, etc).


The question was: why do you say, that if someone bought bitcoins for 100 USD, and now has those bitcoins, then they did not make any profit, because to get a profit, they have to sell first; but you also say, that if someone bought bitcoins for 1000 USD, and now has those bitcoins, then they have already incurred a loss, although they haven't sold yet?


My point was about that whatever you buy for investment, you probably buy it with the goal of later selling it to someone else for a higher price than you bought it. This does not make it a "pyramid scheme". A pyramid scheme is a scheme where all profit comes from newcomer's money and not from providing goods or services. Bitcoin enables lots of economic and computing activity, which was not possible before at all, or had much more friction involved.
I will list just one example -  It is a website where anyone can stream a webcam feed and received payments within 10 seconds of visiting the site for the first time. You literally just enter a stream name, your Bitcoin address, payment rate, and click "Start Broadcasting"; and you keep 100% of the money paid by your viewers. Compare that with similar older services, where you have to register, give out a lot of private information, upload ID documents (introducing identity theft risk), wait several days, and receive only 50% - 60% of the money paid by your viewers. This is what Bitcoin enables. This use case alone makes bitcoins valuable, and there are hundreds (if not thousands) of various other use cases.


Because Bitcoin is a currency, not a stock or a bond. Euros do not have dividends either and there is no entity which is bound to "redeem" your Euros for the "invested amount".

I assumed the 2 final charts are pretty much self explanatory, that's why I did not include a summary, but you are probably right.
The conclusion is that CoinGate and Coinbase are the winners when converting BTC / EUR and also that CoinGate is the clear winner when converting USD / BTC. All other Bitcoin payment processors seem to add 0.5% - 2.0% hidden fee when converting BTC / EUR and 0.5% - 1.5% hidden fee when converting BTC / EUR. This fee is ultimately paid by the customer, by paying more bitcoins for their purchase than they would be paying if the merchant used another Bitcoin payment gateway.

You own screenshot shows "**Buy Bitcoin with a credit card**" on top of the app window, while below it says BCH (meaning that the person would get Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin like the app states). It also shows "Bitcoin Cash" (selected by default) and "Bitcoin Core", but an average person has no idea that "different types of Bitcoin" even exist. They clicked "buy Bitcoin", the app window says "**Buy Bitcoin with a credit card**", so they obviously think they are buying Bitcoin. I personally know at least 3 people who bought Bitcoin Cash while thinking they were buying Bitcoin (they had no idea what Bitcoin Cash is or why there would be "different bitcoins"). Maybe they were stupid for buying something they don't understand, but scamming stupid people is still scamming.

We never had pure socialism or pure capitalism. We only had (and still have) hybrid systems where:
1. Profit is socialized, but losses are privatized (like Venezuela).
2. Profit is privatized, but losses are socialized (like the U.S. and most other western countries which had bank bailouts).
The difference is that because of the human nature, pure socialism can never work even in principle (so trying to achieve it always inevitably leads to human suffering and miserable failure), while pure capitalism can and does work (Bitcoin is an example of a purely capitalistic system).

I think you misunderstand the purpose of my research. I generated an invoice for the same amount (100 EUR and 100 USD), at the same time, from 7 Bitcoin payment gateways. When I do that, you can see which Bitcoin payment gateway asks for the least amount of bitcoins to be paid by the customer. Then I repeated it 29 more times over 2 weeks, and drew a graph of the results.
To give an extreme and simplified example, imagine there are two Bitcoin payment gateways and two merchants using them. The first merchant uses payment gateway A and the second merchant uses payment gateway B. I generate an invoice for the same amount of EUR / USD worth of merchandise on both merchants' websites, and see that on the first merchant's website I would have to pay 1 BTC and on the second merchant's website I would have to pay 0.9 BTC. I repeat it 29 more times over 2 weeks, always generating invoices for the same amount of EUR / USD worth of merchandise at the same time on both merchants' websites, and always notice that I have to pay less bitcoins on the second merchant's website. I can make a conclusion, that payment gateway A charges a margin on the price, which I, the customer, have to pay.
How the margin is calculated is irrelevant from the customers' perspective, all that matters to the customer is that they overpay when buying from the first merchant, and that they would have to pay less if the first merchant also used payment gateway B.

No, you just need to convert the Bitcoin private key to a Litecoin private key, which will "unlock" the same address on the Litecoin network. I have detailed the method here: [
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:47:54
For Litecoin it works, because Litecoin supports SegWit. In fact, I have written a guide on how to recover bitcoins sent to a Litecoin SegWit address: [
However, for Bitcoin Cash this does not work. If you thoroughly read the link you have posted, you will see that the method described there involves a miner recovering the coins for you.










So not only you need a miner to recover the coins, any miner can steal them (yet another way how Bitcoin Cash gives more control to the miners and therefore increases centralization, but that's offtopic).
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:24:58
I don't understand why everyone is saying that nothing can be done. As both Bitcoin and Litecoin uses the same technology (SegWit), a Bitcoin private key **can** be converted to Litecoin private key (and vice versa). Of course, it has do be done by Coinbase, and it is up to them if they will be bothered enough to do it, but it certainly can be done.

Sure (this is a heavily technical explanation, and not very user friendly):
1. Take a Bitcoin private key in WIF (wallet import format).
2. Convert it to hexadecimal format.
3. Add "b0" in front of it and "01" at the end of it.
4. Calculate a double SHA256 hash of the resulting string **as a hex** (use  [ and use the field Binary hash / Hex bytes).
5. Add first 8 symbols from the result of step 4 to the resulting string of step 3.
6. Convert the resulting hex string to WIF using [
1. Bitcoin private key (WIF): KzNDQwKngvExhYzGhsMhHjeacwB9L1Asgo293Kf8TPMutvfr89wv
2. Converting to hex format: 5de30ea8c8a415f7b8a0286a033c9ff9e94415326c405cf0ce611df1067ecec6
3. Add "b0" in front of it and "01" at the end of it: b05de30ea8c8a415f7b8a0286a033c9ff9e94415326c405cf0ce611df1067ecec601
4. First round of hash: 254609e251aeb830ce0e8c37f75b76a15795d550c410b8bdda32394c1d9a7e6d
5. Second round of hash: 103087d15075dd2464c0b49dabce677e36d68179fbb871cd1f846be451946e37
6. "b05de30ea8c8a415f7b8a0286a033c9ff9e94415326c405cf0ce611df1067ecec601" + "103087d1" = b05de30ea8c8a415f7b8a0286a033c9ff9e94415326c405cf0ce611df1067ecec601103087d1
7. Convert it to WIF: T6CUrgcy6JDZUPd9FWJZW6BxZnpTQ6BmVzvPu8Hg2MY5QpCvzyjN
8. Result: we converted Bitcoin private key "KzNDQwKngvExhYzGhsMhHjeacwB9L1Asgo293Kf8TPMutvfr89wv" to Litecoin private key "T6CUrgcy6JDZUPd9FWJZW6BxZnpTQ6BmVzvPu8Hg2MY5QpCvzyjN".
Proof that it works:
Bitcoin private key: KzNDQwKngvExhYzGhsMhHjeacwB9L1Asgo293Kf8TPMutvfr89wv
Litecoin private key: T6CUrgcy6JDZUPd9FWJZW6BxZnpTQ6BmVzvPu8Hg2MY5QpCvzyjN
Use [ (go to "Wallet Details" and enter the Bitcoin private key).

This had absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin. If someone tells you to give them *x* amount of *y* (something valuable) promising to double it in 24 hours and you believe them, then you deserve to lose whatever x amount of *y* you gave them.*y* doesn't have to be bitcoins, it can be literally anything from dollars to chickens to gold to manure.
Furthermore, this story seems very improbable, because no adult person without a serious mental condition could be **that** stupid. This is the equivalent of giving a random stranger on the street a 20 dollar bill and believing they will bring you 40 dollars tomorrow.
However, if this story somehow **is** true, then your friend is the definition of what I would consider **pure evil**. Why? Because his own incredibly stupid actions brought negative (but completely predictable) consequences, but instead of admitting his stupidity and learning from his mistake, he maliciously refuses to admit his fault and instead chooses to blame everything and everyone around him.
"I got scammed using bitcoin? It's bitcoin's fault, ban bitcoin and punish those who voluntarily choose to use it."
"I got addicted to drugs and almost overdosed? It's the drugs' fault, ban drugs and punish those who voluntarily choose use them (especially the guy who i voluntarily bought drugs from and who voluntarily sold them to me)."
"I cut off my own finger with an axe? It's the axe's fault, ban axes and punish the guy who sold me that axe."

Alcohol and nicotine are both more harmful and more addictive than cannabis, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, and most other illegal drugs, but alcohol and nicotine are legal and promoted, while those safer and less addictive drugs are banned. Where is the logic?
Alcohol causes millions of deaths worldwide each year, but everyone understands why alcohol prohibition caused more harm than good - it caused the creation of the mafia, and **raised** the number of people imbibing alcohol. Why is it so hard to apply the same logic to drug prohibition?
Prohibition of any substance has these effects: 1) it **raises* the number of people using that substance, 2) it lowers the quality of the substance resulting in more harm from impurities, 3) it makes it harder to know the purity of the substance resulting in more deaths from accidental overdose. On the other hand, drug legalization reduces the number of drug users, and makes them consistent purity and reduces the number of impurities, significantly lowering deaths from overdose and health harm. If you are sincerely worried about drug users' health, then where is the logic in wanting to ban drugs?
This happens each and every time it is tried:
1) more people were drinking alcohol after the prohibition ended, than before it began (true of both USA and Russian alcohol prohibitions). Lots of people die from alcohol poisoning during prohibition, because alcohol was made in unregulated factories, where many poisonous impurities could be mixed in, because of lack of regulation.
2) after cannabis legalization in 1960s in the Netherlands, cannabis usage dropped (and hard drug usage dropped significantly). Now cannabis usage per capita in the Netherlands is one of the lowest in Europe.
3) cannabis usage dropped in those US states which legalized it.
4) about 16 years ago Portugal decriminalized **all** drugs. After 10 years new HIV cases dropped in half, drug usage also dropped significantly.  (thanks moleccc for correction)
5) Russia has one of the harshest stances on drugs in the world. The result is an appearance of a new drug called "crocodile", which is much more harmful than even heroin, and which can be easily and cheaply made from common household products, making it impossible to ban it (well, you can ban the drug, but you can't ban it's precursors).
All that aside, there is no culture in the world, from today to the beginning of recorded history, where some kind of drug wouldn't take a major part in that culture's everyday life and traditions. It's just that some drugs are so common in our culture, that we don't consider them drugs - like coffee, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, salt. There is **no way** to prevent people from using any and all drugs - it would be as futile (if not more) than trying to prevent people having sex.

As "a networking and games programmer", you should definitely understand the difference between getting into a system for the first time, and working within the system.
When you were talking about VISA, you described your experience of working within the system.
When you were talking about Bitcoin, you described your experience of getting into the system for the first time.
If you were intellectually honest (read: not a troll), you would have compared your experience of buying bitcoins, with your experience of getting a credit card, which I am absolutely sure took longer than one day.

As much as I am against such practice, companies which do this are neither overstepping their bounds nor do they have any choice in the matter (unless they choose to break the AML/KYC laws).
*But why do they not ask for verification before you deposit the funds?*
Because **that** would be overstepping their bounds. As a company, they do not have an obligation to check AML/KYC of every single customer. They do, however, have an obligation to have an AML/KYC policy, and to enforce additional verification measures in case the user is acting suspiciously according to said policy.
TL;DR: blame the government for making stupid laws, not the companies for refusing to break them.

I was not talking about quarantining coins, I was talking about **rejecting** the transaction.
Quarantining coins:
A person using address 1abc... sends coins to BitPay's address 1def... BitPay receives the coins and quarantines them. 1abc... does not have the coins anymore, BitPay has them.
Rejecting transaction:
A person using address 1abc... wants to send coins to address BitPay, so they request BitPay's address via BIP70. BitPay refuses to give their address, as 1abc does not use a KYC/AML compliant wallet. The transaction never happens, as 1abc... is unable to send to payment without an address.
To make it even more simple:
Quarantining: A sends coins to B. B "quarantines" them. B has the coins.
Rejecting: A tries sending coins to B. B rejects the transaction. A has the coins.
You are right that it has nothing to do with coin taint at all, it is much worse.

Are you really arguing that it would be better for them to apply strict AML/KYC to **all** customers, instead of applying it to only those customers who act suspiciously?
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:55:47




No, the KYC/AML is enforced **by law**, it costs the business a lot of money to enforce it, and they are not allowed to keep even a single cent from those frozen funds. Not sure why you keep claiming that they "steal your money", if they are literally forbidden by the law to keep it.

Not sure if you are trolling, being sarcastic, or really that deluded (not trying to offend, just stating a fact).
List of improvements in the latest version alone: 
The reason why you might genuinely delude yourself into thinking that there are no improvements happening in Bitcoin, is because these improvements only serve to expiate the rising blockchain size, e.g. validating the blockchain during the initial block download and reindex is ~30-40% faster (in 0.15.0), but since the blockchain size has grown by a similar amount, the total validation time stays about the same. So you might think: "huh, nothing has changed, the project must be stalled". What would happen without these improvements however, would be that as time goes by it would take more and more resources to run a node. The fact that the resource requirements for running a node have not increased, while the blockchain size has increased several-fold during the last few years, shows the amazing work done by all the Bitcoin developers, aka "Core".
Heck, in a lot of places the technology was improved that much, that it even overtook the growing blockchain size. For example, in 2015 the total blockchain size was a lot smaller than today, yet it took my node several days to synchronize after first launching it. Today, a first-time launched node (launched on exactly the same computer as in 2015) took less than a day to synchronize, even thought the total blockchain size today is much larger than it was in 2015.

The only people touting Bitcoin for it's alleged anonymity are Bitcoin detractors. I have never heard a Bitcoin supporter, or someone who understands how Bitcoin works, to say that Bitcoin is anonymous, when it is quite obviously the exact opposite. Bitcoin is the least anonymous currency is existence. What you were talking about in your post though, was not anonymity (or lack of it), it was privacy (which Bitcoin is also quite lacking).

Rejecting transaction and refusing to process the payment which you already received / sending it back is very different from a legal perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:39:03


I never said that.
It is evil, because deciding which transactions are "accepted" inevitably leads to only accepting payments from whitelisted KYC/AML compliant wallets.
It is evil, because it is **mandatory**, and does not give the user a choice to opt-out.
Please read my original post again, I think I explained my reasoning pretty clearly in it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:13:42
Case (1): The government tells *random Bitcoin processor* to refuse to accept Bitcoin transactions from non-whitelisted addresses. *random Bitcoin processor* explains that this is not possible. The government then requests *random Bitcoin processor* to send all such transactions back. *random Bitcoin processor* explains that is it not possible either, as often it is not clear where to send the coins back to, and doing so would cost *random Bitcoin processor* financially.
Case (2): The government tells *random Bitcoin processor* to refuse to accept Bitcoin transactions from non-whitelisted addresses. *random Bitcoin processor* explains that this is not possible. The government says "quit your bullshit, BitPay did it, so you can either do it too, or go to jail for facilitating money laundering and terrorist financing". *random Bitcoin processor* is forced to enforce this policy of only accepting payments from whitelisted wallets as well.
TL;DR: not having a way to reject the transaction / automatically refund payments is good, because it gives plausible deniability for Bitcoin payment processors.

The law is being ridiculous, not me. You have no idea what you are talking about, and I am done replying to you, as it is obvious you have zero interest to actually learn anything, as you did not reply to anything I wrote, you just insulted me and stated your false opinion about the law as fact.
For anyone else who might be interested in the answer, yes, the law specifically says you must freeze the money if the customer is acting suspiciously according to your AML/KYC policy.
Example  
In Iraj Parvizi v Barclays Bank Plc [2014] EWHC B2 (QB), Mr Parvizi, a professional gambler, sought to bring a claim against Barclays for breach of contract. He argued that the bank, in freezing his account at a critical time, had caused him to suffer considerable financial losses, namely by preventing him from making significant gambling gains. By contrast, Barclays’ argued that it had been justified in its actions as it had detected suspicious account activity.
In a case that provides a welcome clarification for financial institutions concerned about money laundering risks, the **High Court has ruled**, in Iraj Parvizi v Barclays Bank Plc [2014] EWHC B2 (QB), that **a bank’s decision to freeze a customer’s bank account where there was a genuine suspicion of money laundering did not constitute a breach of contract**.
Example  
*Who decides if there is a suspicious activity in a bank account with subsequent reporting?*
The answer is: the compliance officer of the bank. This fact means that **the bank decides**. If it comes out that there is absolutely no criminal activity and the bank has filed a report due to suspicious activity and frozen the account, **the new legislation has discharged the banks from any responsibility**. The **client will not receive any compensation**, even though the mistake might have been making by the bank.
Example  
**Government regulations oblige banks to monitor customers’ accounts for potential money laundering or financial crime**, and any uncharacteristic transactions can trigger fraud filters. These filters flag up connections with, or payments from, countries deemed risky, and under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 banks are not allowed to “tip off” a customer that an investigation may be underway.
**Nor do customers have the right to hear the results of any investigation**. The consequences for innocent victims can be devastating, for once a name appears on a fraud database it can prove impossible to open another bank account elsewhere.
You can find hundreds of similar examples by googling "aml frozen".
P.S. to those with reading comprehension difficulties: I agree that such behavior is disgusting, immoral, and hurting the users. But such behavior is enforced by the AML/KYC regulations, and if any company refused to follow them, they would risk being prosecuted for enabling money laundering (or worse).

You could get ANY computer much cheaper, if you bough each part (RAM, hard drive, motherboard, video card, etc) separately and then assembled it yourself, instead of buying a pre-assembled computer. Still, most people buy pre-assembled computers.

Streamium is an open-source software **in an early alpha stage**, like Bitcoin was in 2009, so of course it is going to have many problems and many limitations, but it is decentralized and open-source, all problems can be solved programmatically, not by centralization.
Your criticism is like criticizing that Bitcoin currently only supports 7 transactions per second and doesn't hide users' IPs, and then offering to use PayPal as a solution.


That is such a bullshit FUD - Streamium is peer-to-peer, of course it doesn't hide users' IPs, most internet services don't hide users' IPs, Bitcoin doesn't hide users' IPs - **that is what VPNs and Tor are for**.
**And your solution to improve privacy is to have every user send copies of their IDs with their faces, full names and other data to you?** Again, it is like offering to use PayPal to improve privacy, because Bitcoin doesn't hide users' IPs and PayPal does.

To put it simply, a miner is someone who collects unverified transactions, puts them into a block, adds several other things to it like a hash of the previous block, and tries to calculate a hash of this block so that leading numbers of the hash are all zeroes.
Miners can choose which transactions to add to a block, or they can add no transactions at all (they only must add one transaction - the one creating new bitcoins). It is just how Bitcoin mining works, there are no special protocols required for that.
This has been discussed again and again, you can find out more by googling "bitcoin empty blocks".

I had many replies, so I will try to reply to all of them in this one post.
*This is a scam.*
How is this a scam? The only way this can be a scam is if 21 inc. fails to ship the device. They have been pretty open about what this device does and what's it's purpose.
*This device has been advertised as a miner, why do they do that if it's not a miner?*
I haven't seen a single sentence on 21 inc. homepage which would suggest that the main purpose of this device is to mine bitcoins.
The first sentence on their homepage clearly states that "The 21 Bitcoin Computer is the first computer with **native hardware and software support for the Bitcoin protocol**."
The first two questions in their FAQ clearly state that "Developers use the 21 Bitcoin Computer to **quickly create apps, services, and devices that can be rented or bought for bitcoin**" and specifically about why the mining chip is included "The 21 Bitcoin Chip is an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) specifically designed to provide a constant stream of bitcoin to your computer as a **system resource**". Nowhere it says that this device is supposed to be a miner and nowhere it says that the mining chip in it is to make money by mining bitcoins.
*Why can't I make the same kind of device using Raspberry Pi and a cheap USB miner?*
Of course you could, when did I say that you couldn't?
*If I can make the same device several times cheaper myself, then what's the point of this device? I told you that this is a scam!*
The same is true for every computing device.
You can get a PC a lot cheaper if you buy separate parts for it an assemble them yourself. Yet, most people buy pre-assembled PCs and pay twice the price. Does that mean that pre-assembled PCs are a scam?
An iPhone costs thousands of dollars when it could be assembled from separate parts for several hundred dollars at most. Does that mean that iPhones are a scam?
This device is what Apple makes - a very overpriced device with average technical specifications, **but your mom can learn how to use it**.
*What does this device do, that couldn't be done by another much cheaper device?*
Nothing, read above.
*What does this device do, that couldn't be done by software?*
Nothing, same as hardware Bitcoin wallets do nothing that couldn't be done by software. The point is to have a separate device, which can by plugged in to any other device, even one loaded with malware and viruses, and still used securely.
*Why not just buy a cheap USB miner ($20) and plug it into a Raspberry Pi ($50) with 21's software ($?) on it, vs $400?*
If you know how to do it, then of course it's better to do what you said.
Why pay 50 dollars to have someone install Windows OS to your PC, when you could do it yourself for free with just a few mouse clicks? Yet, most people pay to have their Windows OS installed for them.
*Mining will rise in several years and this device will become obsolete, because it won't be able to mine enough bitcoins to even cover the transaction fees. When it happens, the people who bough it will feel scammed.*
This is true for every computing device. People buy a new PC every 3 - 5 years. People buy a new iPhone each year. The USB flash drive I bought 7 years ago (16 GB capacity, for bringing movies to watch at friends) was top of the line then, and became obsolete 5 years later, because [one 4k movie takes 160 GB]( (10 times the capacity of my USB flash drive). I don't feel scammed though, why should I?
*If 21 inc. sent some bitcoins to their devices, it would not make them a money transmitter. That's not what a money transmitter is. You can argue that this makes them fall into regulations X, Y or Z, but not into money transmitter regulations.*
You are probably right.
*If 21 inc. mines bitcoins in their pool, they then have to send them to the users, therefore they are subject to all the same regulations anyway.*
That is not how mining works. The mined coins do not have any inputs, i.e. 21 inc. does not send them to users. Have a look at [this transaction]( to see what I mean. Maybe not all pools do this at the moment, but it can certainly be done (and I would argue that those pools that mine bitcoins to their own addresses and then send them out to users are doing it wrong).
*OP making claim that this thing is as secure as a Trezor, but is it?*
I never did make such claim. It's impossible to know how secure this device is, until it ships. I only used Trezor as an analogy to the argument that "*everything this device does could be done by software*".
This Bitcoin Computer would make more sense if it would be a full node that also contributed a small amount of hashing power to the network, probably at a small monetary loss.
It **is** a full node. It is clearly stated on 21 inc. FAQ:
Can I run the 21 Bitcoin Computer as a full node?
Yes, which is why it comes with a full copy of the Blockchain pre-loaded on a 128GB SD card. The computer will briefly synchronize with the network when you plug it in, after which point **it will run as a full node by default without further intervention**.
In conclusion, I am pretty disappointed by the lack of any real discussion and the amount of straw-man arguments and ad-hominem attacks and calls that this is a scam. I am having an unpleasant deja-vu, because this is exactly the reaction I used to get when telling people about Bitcoin. I really hoped that the Bitcoin community would be at least open-minded enough to criticize something constructively. What a shame. Thank you for those who did make some real constructive criticism.

You contradict yourself. You say that:
1. They won't even mine a tiny amount of bitcoins.
2. They will mine so fast, that it will cause the mining difficulty to go up.
In my opinion, these devices are so weak compared to modern ASICs, that even a million of them wouldn't make any noticeable difference in Bitcoin mining difficulty.
Yet, if a million of them would mine 10000 bitcoins in a year (less than 1% of all Bitcoin mining power), that would give each one of those devices the ability to make 100 smart contracts (assuming 0.0001 BTC price for one smart contract). And by the time we have a million devices actively using the Bitcoin blockchain for smart contracts, the transaction price would probably have gone way down from what it is now.

This Bitcoin Computer **would** make more sense if it were like the Bitnodes Hardware B1 with a built-in mining chip. It **would be** a full node that also contributed a small amount of hashing power to the network, probably at a small monetary loss. This **would** likely be acceptable to enthusiasts because running a full node costs a bit of electricity anyway and some people like the idea of contributing to the network. Not a huge market, but at least it **would** make sense for that market.
It **is** (not **would be**) exactly what you described.

Who is "everyone"? I have no idea why anyone thought that this devices' main function is to act as a miner. The FAQ on 21 inc. homepage clearly states that it's NOT a miner. The only ones confused, are those who apparently failed to read even the FAQ.
Bitcoin wiki defines smart contract as: A distributed contract is a method of using Bitcoin to form agreements with people via the block chain. Contracts don't make anything possible that was previously impossible, but rather, they allow you to solve common problems in a way that minimizes trust. Minimal trust often makes things more convenient by allowing human judgements to be taken out of the loop, thus allowing complete automation.
Wikipedia defines it as: Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that obviate the need for a contractual clause.

You could say exactly the same about hardware Bitcoin wallets (for example about Trezor):
Trezor is buying a second PC just for the sake of using Bitcoin, for convenience.
Both PC and Macs are general purpose devices. Apple's hardware and software are also pretty unique. Trezor has a single purpose and doesn't provide anything that wouldn't be possible by a purely software upgrade to any existing computer.
The point is, that general purpose devices are too insecure to be used for Bitcoin, hence the need for hardware Bitcoin wallets, and now, for hardware Bitcoin computers.

I can do it, you can do it, but most people (for example my mom) would **NEVER EVER** be able to do it on their own. But my mom knows how to plug a device into a USB port, so if to run a full node all she had to do was to plug a device in, then she would be able to run a full node too (without even knowing what is a full node).
The point **is NOT** that 21 inc. device allows to run a full node cheaper (it does not, you could do it 4 times cheaper yourself).

Have you thought about accepting payments through the bitcoin payment system?
1. You would not need to even touch bitcoin currency, you would be receiving EUR (USD, GBP, etc.) to your bank account, the EXACT amount that you set, regardless of bitcoin currency price (if you set price of merchandise to 10 euros, then you would receive exactly 10 euros).
2. Charge-backs are impossible. Therefore, you will be able to receive payments from ANY country, even those high-risk countries from which you weren't able to accept payments (because of fraud risk) before.
3. No need to collect customers' data (unless you want to). Therefore, no possibility of customers' identity theft.
4. It takes about 30 minutes to integrate into your website (store, shop, etc.). It is absolutely free to setup and to accept it - even if no one ever pays through bitcoin, you would not lose a single cent.
5. Go to  to start accepting payments through bitcoin.

What does this have to do with anonymity? Bitcoin payments are not anonymous either - a complete lack of anonymity is one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) flaws of Bitcoin.
The fact that credit card transactions are confirmed by a centralized company only means that they can be canceled much easier than Bitcoin transactions, as you only have to ask your bank to cancel the transaction, and they have no incentive to side with the merchant instead of you, as you are their direct client, while the merchant is not.

"I would argue" - so where are your arguments? :)
Currently, double spend attempt must be started several seconds after the (first) transaction has been sent, to have any chance at being successful, so it is easy to detect and you have to wait just a few seconds.
RBF can happen at any time until the (first) transaction if included in a block. You can not detect something which is not happening yet, so you have to wait for 1-conf.
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:57:29
"Who uses 0-conf transactions?"
Every major Bitcoin payments processor.
"If I could get a few links I would understand the outrage better."
I have used Bitcoin for payments over a 100 times this year. The only two places I have found which require the payer to wait for confirmations are coinpayments.net (Bitcoin payment processor) and premiumgiftcards.com (Steam card seller which processes the payments themselves). My most common payments are for taxi services. If RBF would be implemented, it would become impossible for me to pay for a taxi using Bitcoin, because it is completely impractical to wait for 1-conf in a taxi after you arrive at your destination.
Judging from your other posts, you seem to not understand that RBF based double spend can be started at any time until the original transaction is not yet included in a block. That can take 1 second, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or even longer.
For comparison, currently double spend can only be performed successfully if the original transaction didn't have time to propagate through the network yet. That can take several seconds at most and is much easier to prevent by Bitcoin payment processors by urging the propagation of the original transaction.

What's stopping someone from just "faking" (charge-backing) the transaction when paying with a credit card?
This is one of the most ridiculous "arguments" against Bitcoin. Credit card transactions can be canceled weeks after payment. Bitcoin transactions can be canceled minutes (maximum hours) after payment. Additionally, reversing a credit card transaction requires a simple call to the bank (i.e. everyone can do it), while reversing a Bitcoin transaction requires at least intermediate level technical skills. Yet somehow merchants should wait for Bitcoin transactions to become irreversible, but not for credit card transactions to become irreversible?

I don't know. Counter question: who is using Bitcoin at this very second?


You can't, because such a directory does not exist yet. Go ahead and create it. Counter question: was there a directory of Bitcoin accepting businesses in 2009?


You can't yet, go ahead and improve Streamium to enable previews - it's open source and everyone can contribute.


When you start streaming, you get a stream link. You can advertise your stream link anywhere you want.


By advertising that they will be streaming in advance.


Ask the streamer for their Bitcoin address and send them more bitcoins.


You can choose the stream rate before starting the stream. You can't do a "free" stream yet. Go ahead and improve Streamium to add these functions - it's open source and everyone can contribute.


Because they don't have to register anywhere to use it, censorship is impossible, streamers keep 100% of money collected from viewers.


Not sure I understand your question. If you are criticizing Streamium for lack of functions, then I already explained to you - Streamium is software in alpha state, just like Bitcoin was in 2009.


Ad-hominem attacks start when the opponent has no more arguments left.

Because the "shills" of your platform (your word, not mine) are:
1. Suggesting a centralized solution for problems instead of suggesting how to improve a decentralized one. Not only that, but they are suggesting that centralization **is** the solution and that decentralized services are **inherently** worse.
2. They are doing that dishonestly, by spreading FUD about the only currently existing decentralized platform (Streamium). You are guilty of this yourself, because you tried to a) spread irrational fear about predators being able to stalk users, because Streamium doesn't hide users' IPs, when almost none of decentralized web services hides users' IPs and they are not supposed to do that - that's the job of VPNs and Tor, both of which can be used with Streamium; b) spread the absurd notion that Streamium is inherently "unscalable".
3. The vote manipulation was quite obvious as was the fake threads. No one has ever asked about webcam services for bitcoins in in a year, then suddenly there are three different threads by three different users in the same day, all asking the same question, and they all get the same answer advertising xotika.tv almost instantly, and all the posts suggesting xotika.tv get tens of upvotes in less than an hour, while all later posts suggesting Streamium get immediately downvoted. Yeah, riiiight, no manipulation at all.
To be clear, I have no problem at all with you making money from it. As I said, Streamium is in early alpha stage and still has many problems unsolved - like being unable to register stream names, not being able to stream to several hundred people at once, lacking streams directory, etc. **If you create a service which uses Streamium (or any other decentralized technology - I have no attachment to Streamium in particular) as a backbone** and which solves all those problems (lets people register stream names, creates a directory of streams, etc) then even if you take 50% of peoples' earnings, I will have no problem with it and will whole-heartedly support you.

You seem to think Streamium is a company (either that, or you don't know what the meaning of the word "shill" is). It is not a company, it is an open-source software. It has no income. How/why would the Streamium developers pay me to "shill", if they make no money from this project?
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:46:13
No it is not.
The example given (a few comments below) is this:
"You pay vendor A. A half hour later, you go to pay vendor B. A half hour after that you to go pay vendor C. The first payment has not confirmed yet, so rather than making separate transactions your wallet revises the prior one to pay A, B, and C, paying a higher fee and getting you faster confirmation; while still saving you half the fees and 2/3rds of the blockchain capacity."
**But this is not relevant, because each of those merchants (A, B and C) could get the transaction(s) confirmed themselves, using child-pays-for-parent.**
"Saving 2/3rds of the blockchain capacity" is not a valid argument, because first, this is supported by the same people who say that there is no need to raise the block sizes, and second, my question was "Can you name at least one use case, that could be achieved using Opt-in RBF, but **could not be achieved** using child-pays-for-parent" (it was **NOT** "Can you name at least one use case, that could be achieved using Opt-in RBF **more efficiently regarding blockchain size**, than it could be achieved using child-pays-for-parent").
The downside of using RBF in this scenario, is that the sender could defraud all those merchants with RBF, while using child-pays-for-parent the merchants can even protect themselves from being defrauded by hurrying up the transaction themselves.
So, my question has been unanswered and still stands.

And I already explained that if you are capable then you can build a similar device 4 times cheaper.
How do you expect Bitcoin to go mainstream, if only people competent with technology can use it? It's like asking "why would someone who is incompetent with technology use e-mail?"
People won't buy it to run a full node, they will buy it to sell goods and services. They probably won't even know what a full node is or that they are running it. And that's the whole point, because that's the only way Bitcoin can go mainstream - if it becomes so easy to use, that anyone (especially someone incompetent with technology) can use it.

No, it does not answer my question.
My question was "Can you name at least one use case, that could be achieved using Opt-in RBF, but **could not be achieved using child-pays-for-parent**", it was **NOT** "Can you name at least one use case, that **could be achieved using Opt-in RBF more efficiently regarding blockchain size**, than it could be achieved using child-pays-for-parent".

Did you not read the link which I have posted to you twice now?

My Bitcoin node consumes about 2**T**B of data per month. I doubt even an "unlimited" mobile plan would allow that (usually they are not literally unlimited).
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:27:34
Most of that used bandwidth is upload traffic, because newly connected nodes have to download the full blockchain from somewhere.
Also, nodes constantly forward blocks and transactions to each other, that's how they propagate through the network. It should be noted, that it is possible to limit a number of connections that a node has and/or limit upload traffic, however I did not limit it in any way, so my node has \~120 connections.
Have you ever used file torrenting? Let's say you seeded 1GB file. If it is a popular file and a lot of people downloaded it from you, that can use 100s of GBs of your (upload) traffic. Same here, just that the "files" "torrented" are blocks and transactions.

No. I use 5 different Bitcoin wallets and I would not be able to pay using any of them. This is not "pay with Bitcoin".

There are two methods to fight racists, fascists, pedophilia supporters, etc.
1. Have the government decide what is unacceptable, and have the government enforce it by enacting laws against it (totalitarianism, collectivism).
2. Have the individuals decide what is unacceptable, and have the individuals enforce it by socially ostracizing and financially boycotting those who they don't agree with (voluntarism, individualism).
If you like Bitcoin, you should support method nr. 2, which is what happened in this case.

That's not how any of this works. Read the link I posted.

Obligatory: not supporting them, just explaining how the law works.
Most likely they filed a [SAR]( (suspicious activity report) regarding your account, which means that they are legally obligated to **not** (directly or indirectly) give you any hint about it, meaning they cannot reply or give any information to you (if you do receive a reply, it will most likely be a very non-specific "empty" reply).

I already explained the most likely reason here: [
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:52:49
Not supporting them, but they are legally required to do this by law, and you refusing to verify has probably triggered a [SAR]( (suspicious activity report) being sent about your account, which means that they are legally required to **not** (directly or indirectly) give you any hint about it, meaning they cannot reply or give any information to you (if you do receive a reply, it will most likely be a very non-specific "empty" reply).

Obviously they already know that information, and they are asking these questions not to get that information, but to make sure that **you** know that information, as a security measure, because the real owner of the account should know it. It seems you are either an idiot to not understand these things, or a scammer trying to access someone else's account.
As someone who was a victim of theft because of phishing (my own fault for being stupid) and because of the service (thankfully they went bankrupt, free market forces in working) removing my 2FA after the hacker requested it to be removed, I am glad not all services in crypto space are completely clueless when it comes to how to do security.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:01:45


















If this is your account, how can you not know these things? Do you even understand the purpose of 2FA? Honestly, 2FA should not be possible to remove at all, but at least it's good to know that CoinGate is not removing it willy-nilly.

My Bitcoin node uses about 2TB (2000GB) of data per month. That would be a hundredfold increase from 20GB.

Your seed does not go anywhere, you could use it on an offline computer.
When you generate random numbers (for example your public/private key pairs), you can generate them from a seed (a number or vector used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator). You can generate unlimited count of numbers this way. When you try to generate numbers from the same seed again, they will be exactly the same ones as before.
