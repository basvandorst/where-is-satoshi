Yeah I constantly teach people at school how to use Torrents and the Pirate Bay... free of charge haha

My own account. You don't need license verification on Coinbase if you use a debit card (which I have)

Yeah, to the moon lmao
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:50:15
Thank you!

haven't told them yet, haha.

What is the cryptocurrency furthest to the right? The blue one.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:19:24
To everyone that said I'm a "he" you are correct.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:01:57
It just means hold, like you hold onto your BTC until it reaches a crazy value then you sell it. Most people hold for years
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:58:14
How much Bitcoin do you have now?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:51:02
Yep I bought my first part of a Bitcoin yesterday
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:56:38
Yeah that was me. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:43:35
Thanks a bunch! I never realized how generous redditors are, haha!
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:37:57
Well thanks!!
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:52:01
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:10:52
I'll pass on that one.

I'm the 16 y/o. I didn't ask people to pay me, they offered and I accepted (who wouldn't), so I commented the code and then more people decided to give me BTC. I didn't ask and I don't think it's "free money" I am very grateful though.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:09:06
Thanks so much!

I dislike them because they have bad customer support.
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:07:37
Oh wow this means absolutely nothing!
I swear, you guys try to prove bitcoin is going to go sky high with literally no evidence. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:39:48
I enjoy Gemini more than Coinbase and GDAX personally
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:34:46
Oh yeah I am that kid... I don't think there is any correlation between me and OP. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:35:34
Glad I can get such great information from someone who hasn't been on Reddit for a week yet.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:32:10
We'll be at 10k by American Thanksgiving!

Just because it drops doesn't mean it's dead.
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:15:41
Its clearly a Malibu.
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:13:48
Anything can go down at any time. Bitcoin is kinda a gamble  but you have a higher chance of winning if you just HODL until Bitcoin reaches new milestones

It's never going to hit $1... it won't even come relatively close. The lowest it will go is $1,500.
P.S. It feels fine to lose money considering when the drop stops, I'll go right back up again.

The 2nd mouse churned that cream to butter and crawled out.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:45:46
I figured it was going to go lower than 3k and when I looked 3 hours later, it was at 3.5k... I was very disappointed in myself.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:00:49
I thought maybe you guys would know what happens to the transactions or something.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:50:04
Yeah I'm waiting for when China has sold everything and the price dips... then I'll invest maybe $250-$350
