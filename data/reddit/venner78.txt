I have an account there and if I’m making a large transfer, they’re my go-to exchange. But, for smaller fiat deposits, they don’t exactly make it easy unless you’re able to use debit,l, and my bank, a CIBC affiliate apparently doesn’t support that.

I’d prefer to use debit with Quadriga, but CIBC and it’s affiliates don’t support it. E-transfers aren’t a bad option, but it’s a $2K minimum transfer. So, I’m just trying to find a semi-convenient option for weekly, or quick buys at times like this when there’s a massive sale on bitcoin. I’m not a big fan of Coinbase or the way they do things, but they made the process easy. They’ll soon be out of business in Canada if they don’t start offering a fiat money deposit option. 
I’ll have a look at nTrust and see for myself. Thanks.

That’s the typical attitude of all banks, isn’t it? I have to ask permission to use, invest, or spend my money. And if they’re gracious enough to allow me to do so, they make me pay for the privilege of spending it. This is why I stand behind crypto currencies so much and believe in their vision. Centralized banking has to go!

Day trading is usually a recipe for losses - unless you’re either very lucky, or really know what you’re doing. Lots of people make good money doing it, but it’s extremely difficult to time right and most people end up losing money. Best just to buy the dips and hodl long term. Your overall profits will likely be higher doing that, and it’s far less stressful.

That's awesome! lol

I use QuadrigaCX and Coinbase in Canada. Coinbase is usually only for Ether and Litecoin when the price is reasonable since I can quickly make the purchase with my MasterCard. QuadrigaCX is usually cheaper and their fees are more reasonable but getting money to them is a pain in the ass sometimes. Several banks and credit unions don’t work with the Interac Online option and their new e-transfer option is currently down and you can only make transfers of $2000-$10000 - which for normal users is maybe a little high. You can do and electronic funds transfer, which allows smaller dollar amounts and reasonable fees, but it takes 3-5 business days, so can’t use it for a quick buy in the event of a dip. 
All in all, they’re a good exchange to work with, but funding can be frustrating.

This is a rare event...a dip that wasn’t caused by me buying. I didn’t think that was possible!

I’m expecting Ripple or bCash, but I’m hoping for IOTA or NEO. 
If it ends up being bCash and only bCash, I’m going to be pissed!

Coinbase dies if the wind blows too hard. They must’ve bought their server hardware from Walmart or something

Primarily QuadrigaCX in Canada. It was between $21K and $22K CAD all day. Dropped down as low as $16K. Back up just below $21K now. It was a short ride on that exchange. Saw Coinbase dropped below $20K as well. Not sure about the other big exchanges

I’m in for 100% of my savings, and add about 20-25% of my weekly salary to the pot. I’m new to the game, so I’m trying to build up as much coin as I can before this bitch goes to the moon.

I’d expected that Coinbase was going to add Bcash. I had hoped I was wrong, or at least that they’d add a decent altcoin as well. I get it, it’s a marketing and sales thing. New people will blindly buy Bcash because its cheap and has the word “bitcoin” in it, not knowing they’re buying a sh!tcoin. 
Oh well, it is what it is. They’ll make money from this and that’s their priority. I’ve lost some respect for them, but my dealings with Coinbase are minimal and only to make a quick buy during a dip. That’s not changing anytime soon now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:21:10
Worry about a $6000-$7000 dip? I'm impatiently waiting for a dip that big. In fact, the only thing that keeps me up at night is that I won't see that dip...or I'll sleep through it like the last time...damn it!

Me too, but I’m looking long term. Helps soften the blow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:39
I feel your pain. I bought nearly half a coin less than an hour before the drop. I nearly threw up when the drop started. Oh well...it’ll snap back. No worries in the long run, a little less coin in my wallet, but not a big deal in the grand scheme of things
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:29:14
I’d pull every penny out of my savings and throw it into BTC. Though, over half of my savings has already been put into BTC

I tried to open an account with a local credit union a couple weeks ago to more easily transfer money to an exchange. The second I mentioned the word “bitcoin”, they told me they wouldn’t open the account
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:14:33
That would be friggin huge for anyone currently sitting on BTC!

That’s a gamble I’m willing to take lmao. If someone’s willing to wager money to eat his penis, I’m willing to stake my cash to see it happen...well...maybe not “see it happen”...but you know what I mean lol

I’m a newb...and my greatest concern is that I’ll buy before the dip hits bottom. Which happened tonight...bought when it hit $9700CDN and it’s since dropped almost $200 further. It’s a small difference, but it makes me question whether I should’ve waited longer. 
Still better than paying $10,300CDN if I’d bought this afternoon. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:26:33
LMAO valid question!
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:27:22
Like most people above, I buy in whenever I have a couple hundred dollars kicking around - usually ever week or 2 depending on OT at work. If things work out as I hope they will, I’ll hit the 1BTC mark by January 1st, but that’s gonna be a challenge.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:37:25
No idea. But the news agencies are always so quick to say bitcoin is done when there’s a dip. Nice to see them scrambling to deal with their own issues

The only “security risk” related news I’ve heard about pertaining to the Nano S is about people buying compromised units from Amazon.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:25:50
Obviously not. The point of the sarcasm was that the news and traditional investment companies always claims bitcoin is dead when there’s even the slightest dip. It’s nice to be able to turn it around on them.
