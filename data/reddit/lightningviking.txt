Why do you assume it's a matter of loyalty?
Most people shop at Amazon because they objectively provide better service for those peoples' contexts.  For people who would like to promote bitcoin by spending it, that is no longer true.
Loyalty isn't necessarily part of the equation.  That assumption is irrational.

I don't understand.  $6,000 would be a total of $1.8 million. For an initial investment of $180k, that is a return of 900%. (Assuming an initial bitcoin price of $600.)
Then you sell the Berkshire stock back.  Assuming it hadn't changed too much in price, you're left with 1000% of the original bet amount.
So the potential upside for betting on bitcoin is quite large.  The potential upside for betting on Berkshire is smaller in comparison, but still there.
The best case scenario for betting on Berkshire is that Berkshire does a modest rise, and bitcoin flatlines.  That way you can sell the bitcoin you bought back for net 0 cost in participating in the bet, and receive $220k (assuming ~20% growth of the stock) from the other party.

No, they do not.  This has been debunked countless times.
They have to cancel orders that they deem high risk because if they don't, they'll simply go broke to fraud.  This inevitably happens to some well-intentioned users who aren't scammers, because it is impossible for their algorithms to be perfect.
When the price happens to be going up and this happens to users, they all scream "scam!".  And nobody hears from the silent majority of users who were perfectly fine.
When the price happens to be going down and this happens to users, and they actually are prevented from losing money, you never hear a single peep about it, except for maybe [this post]( which which was upvoted into oblivion.

This doesn't get around my point.  If you lose your blockchain.info password, you're F'd.  The way around that is to create backups, at which point you're already way over most people's heads and scared them away.
Cloud wallets serve a valuable purpose. They are not for you, obviously, but they are well suited for others, especially newbs.  Someone who is new to bitcoin is not doing the *wrong thing* by using a cloud wallet to get started.
That attitude is extremely dangerous, not just because it turns people away, but because it also guides inexperienced users into doing things that are above their skill level, in many cases leading to the loss of their coins into the void.
Every other week we hear about some small cloud wallet or exchanged getting hacked.  What we don't hear about are the mulitude of individual people who just lose their own coins out of ignorance or mistake on a daily basis.  Speaking up won't help them, because they have no one to blame but themselves, and the misguided purists who led them in the wrong direction. This slow trickle is something to be fought, not promoted.

Aren't there already places you can sell things online for bitcoin, like shopify?  Seems doubtful that Coinbase would want to get in the business of running storefronts for users.
One of the benefits of these pages is that they appear to generate new addresses, so people can't watch the funds that you collect.  Also if the user is signed into coinbase already, the sending process is just a lot easier, because all you do is click.

Contrary to popular belief, I actually think it would be evil to *not allow people to use bitcoin as they want*.  If you think a cloud wallet is more convenient, go for it.  Just  know the tradeoffs.
This idea that the purpose of bitcoin is to force everyone to be their own bank needs to die.  Bitcoin is beautiful because it provides that option if you want it.  And it's an extremely important option to have.  But you shouldn't be *made* to be your own bank if you don't want to.

The only companies that can afford to do that are companies that are already established and making enough profit to simply hire extra engineers for the sake of that kind of charity.  And generally speaking, companies that are already established to this level will be in a field completely unrelated to bitcoin, thus having no desire to allocate resources to it.  I too wish it would happen, but I'm not holding my breath.
Bitcoin startups are short on cash and are focused on putting engineering resources into their product idea, which leaves them mostly unable to dedicate resources as well.
By the time bitcoin startups grow into big enough companies that they can just hire extra engineers to charitably donate engineering time to the protocol itself, bitcoin will have become widespread enough that the protocol will already be set in stone.
This seems like a problem and I do not know how to solve it.
Gavin is getting a salary from bitcoin foundation, right?  Is bitcoin foundation itself hiring any new developers?  If not, why not?  How can we help it hire more devs?  Are devs aware that the bitcoin protocol even can be developed further, or do most assume that satoshi wrote the beginning and the end, and development has already been finalized?
Bitcoin foundation needs to get the word out that it needs help.  We in this subreddit need to help spread that message as well.  Otherwise devs just simply are not going to know.  That's an even bigger blocker than salary or resources - just plain lack of knowledge.

Someone with a WSJ account should at least comment there and correct the innacuracies being reported.

But you can still verify by amount, inputs and outputs that comprise the transaction.

Then he was wrong.
Satoshi wasn't an oracle, he was human.
One of the worst things about early bitcoin adopters and one of the biggest things helping to prevent bitcoin's adoption is the vehement rejection of any mild interest by curious parties of using centralized wallets.
Your friend John hears about bitcoin on the news.  He doesn't know much about it, but he approaches it out of open-minded curiosity.  He decides to buy a bitcoin and asks you for advice.  The conversation goes like this:
John: "Hey, bitcoin seems cool.  Should I buy one?"
You: "Definitely! Owning bitcoin is the best way to learn about it."
John: "Cool!  I was thinking of using Coinbase.  Should I do that?"
You: "Yeah, that's the simplest method. But you don't want to store it there."
John: "Oh.  Why not?"
You: "Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency. Satoshi said that centralized wallets are extremely dangerous."
John: "Uh okay. Where should I keep my bitcoin?  Is there an app for it maybe?"
You: "You want to keep it somewhere where only you have keys, so your assets cannot be seized, and in the case of centralized failure, you are protected."
John: "Well, I'm not really paranoid about seizure, and Xapo provides insurance so that seems safe... This is getting a little complicated, but if you really think that's best, what's next?"
You: "Well ideally you want to create a new wallet address on an airgapped laptop booted from a linux CD, so that it can never be traced.  You also want to create paper backups, possibly encrypted with BIP38.  Of course, you need to be careful where you print the backups, because private keys can be cached in the printer history. Every time you want to access your bitcoin, you will need to boot up this airgapped laptop, sign a transaction, port it to a USB stick and then broadcast it from an internet-connected computer. You could run a local wallet but then you will never actually be certain that all your bitcoin won't be stolen while you're sleeping."
John: "Wow.  Well, I thought bitcoin was a virtual currency?  Can't I just use it on my regular computer?"
You: "Trust me, if you want to use it the right way, this is what you do."
John: "That really sounds like a lot of work.  I really can't just, like, buy it and leave it there?"
You: "You would be stupid if you do that.  You would literally be an idiot.  That is not what bitcoin is for."
John: "Okay, so if I create a client-side wallet like this, what happens if I lose my password?"
You: "It's all lost forever. Sucks for you! Lol."
John is extremely confused, thinks the whole idea is stupid, and at that very moment writes it off.
If we want people to adopt bitcoin, we have to be open to letting them use it in their own way.  They will learn about it from there in baby steps, and the ones who appreciate the be-your-own-bank aspect of it will take advantage of that when they learn.
It is enough to have the ability to be decentralized and be happy with it ourselves, and try to enlighten others about it.  We do not have to berate others for using it in different ways.  That doesn't help anyone at all.  Not you or me or your friend John, or the countless people who would have heard about it from John who will now not.
This approach, adopted by most people in this subreddit, is something that is actively turning people away from bitcoin.

There's always going to be some dummies exchanging at higher prices, just because somebody else moved the price up.  If I owned bitstamp and wrote a bot to drive the price to $4k, guess what? Some people are going to start trading it at $4.1k, $4.2k, etc, because they think that everyone else thinks it's worth that much.  So the fact that Willy was not trading the highest prices actually has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not he affected the price. He did, greatly.

Depending on what Circle's spread is, it could turn out to be higher than any stated fee that Coinbase has.  It's not like all these companies magically sync on what their spread is, and then choose to add or not add a fee on top.

That's a wildly emotional interpretation of the word "endorse."  To endorse is simply to approve of; to evaluate, and determine that there is value.  It doesn't mean "you should buy from them" or "you must buy from them," it means "there are good reasons to buy from them."  It isn't necessarily based on emotion at all.
People "endorse" businesses so that other consumers are informed.  It's the free-market alternative to governments manually approving or rejecting specific businesses, a-la authoritarianism.
Endorsements are not only *not* "a waste of thought," they are desirable in any self-organizing market.  And they can be as objective as anything else.  Still not sure why you're trying to inject this "emotion" angle where it doesn't necessarily exist.
An endorsement is just a value judgment, publicly stated.  How can you determine what means will get you to what end, if you consider value-judging the means "a waste of thought"?  You can't.

Bitcoin is designed such that you have a *choice* about whether you want to have "cryptographic control" over your money, or whether you prefer to store it with another institution because you feel it is a better idea for any number of reasons.  (i.e. you don't trust yourself with something so important.)
This idea that because bitcoin gives us each independent control means that we *have* to use it that way is completely false.
*Forcing* people to handle money themselves (or in this case promoting the idea that people *should always* handle their money themselves) when there's a free market of services to handle money for them, and potentially provide benefits the person could not attain on their own, is just as bad as forcing people to hold their money in banks.

You seem to be missing the point.  Volume hardly matters. You can have a volume of 1 billion if two people trade the same bitcoin back and forth at lightning speed for an hour.

You absolutely should.  I never said you shouldn't.


This really is just not true at all.  If you're bad at managing passwords and don't trust yourself, that's a reason.  If you need to trade, that's a reason.  If you think you might die and want your family to inherit your wealth without having to fuck up the process of distributing M of N keys, that's a reason.  If the centralized service provides insurance, that's a reason.  If it provides a vault service which you feel is more secure and reliable than yourself, that's a reason.
The whole idea that we should be *strongly recommending* people to store their *life savings* in a way that is as easy to lose as simply *forgetting a password* is absolutely insane.  Telling people to put so much money into something so fickle, that they don't want to deal with, is, yes, evil.  If you're a power user or being your own bank is something that is philosophically appealing to you and you know the risks, by all means, do it.

If you really think the only advantage bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) provide is that they allow you to be anonymous from the government, you're truly missing out on some of the other things that make it superior.  If that was the only argument for bitcoin, I really don't think it would have much value.  It also has (1) global reach, (2) deflationary nature, (3) microtransactions, and (4) be your own bank.  These are superior reasons for the existence of bitcoin.
I even *agree* with you that being able to circumvent regulation is important, and I hope to see that used widely by everyone to push change of our monetary systems.  But if that isn't your goal, there are still other *really really* good reasons to use bitcoin.  If you don't see them, I suspect you like bitcoin only for political reasons instead of technological ones as well, which makes me a little disappointed.

The idea that bitcoin is good as a payment network but crappy as a currency does not and has never made sense.  The only way you are able to transfer dollars (or any other non-bitcoin currency) over the bitcoin network, is to buy bitcoin on one side and sell it on the other.  In both cases, you can only buy and sell it from people who are already holding it.  So in reality, the holding of bitcoin is what allows the bitcoin network to transfer value.  The network can transfer value because bitcoins themselves have value, because they are held, because they are a currency.
Just to continue a bit, bitcoin is not really a great payment network for non-bitcoin anyway.  (It is in terms of global reach and instant-ness, which are extremely important, but not price.)  It is definitely not equivalent to visa, where, when you transfer a dollar, you are transferring something of equal value on both sides.  The bitcoin network does this, but *only for bitcoin itself*.  Exchanges built on top of bitcoin allow you to transfer dollars by buying on one side and selling on the other, but if you need to do this, the exchanges are likely in different jurisdictions with different exchange rates, so the sent fiat amount and the received fiat amount would be different.  Even if it were the very same exchange, the buy eats through the asks (moving price up) and the sell by the recipient eats through the bids (moving the price down), so the amount received is *less* than the amount sent.  And by how much can vary heavily depending on the amount and the depth of the order book.
Bitcoin is a fabulous currency and network, and I love everything about it.  But this idea that the bitcoin network is perfect for *non-bitcoin things and not the bitcoin currency itself*, seems to me really strange, wrong, and misguided.

I think that due to some recent changes, the coinbase checkout page will tell you to "proceed with caution" because not all merchants have filled out the new info yet, but you can verify that it is the correct link from their blog post announcing it: 
I know bitcoiners are always looking for good ways to help spread the idea of bitcoin and help people out, so I thought this would be a great way to do it.  The idea of sending money *directly* to people in need, so that they can decide how they spend it themselves, instead of a big lumbering charity spending it on their behalf, is really satisfying to me.

This is land-grab mode.  You provide everything you can at the lowest cost (in this case free), burning through investment money to gain userbase.  Eventually you have to monetize, but the hope is to be sufficiently big from burning that you are the either the leader of the pack or on a good enough tragectory to raise another round of investment to keep the burn going.
Edit: There is also the possibility that they are selling you bitcoin at a higher price than they are purchasing it. e.g. if they sell you 1 BTC for $450, but they bought it on bitstamp for $445. It doesn't show up in their list of charges, but it still cost you $5. This would be a hidden fee, and kind of sleazy. So far nobody's got access so we don't know what their spot rates are like.

Sending back automatically is a horrible idea.  Some clients are setup such that they send from addresses that are discarded and won't be available for receipt.  Also if a transaction has multiple inputs it's not always clear which one to refund to.  Refunds shouldn't be done automatically until refund addresses are part of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:14:03
I'm not sure what post you're referencing, but it sounds like you're talking about a paper wallet. A paper wallet is just a private key and public key printed on a piece of paper, nothing else special about it.
What are you trying to accomplish exactly? Without talking about private/public keys, what practical thing are you trying to do? Print a paper wallet? Move money into coinbase? Buy bitcoin? Just explain that and it might be easier to help.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:03:32
If you already have bitcoin, you can send it to your Coinbase account by first signing in, and then going to "receive" in the top right, then click "Bitcoin Address". That'll show you a public address, and if you send bitcoin to it, then it will go to your Coinbase account. Once it's in your regular account, go to "Accounts" and then "transfer bitcoin" to move it from your regular wallet to your vault.
But it sounds like you don't already have bitcoin, so you may be a little bit confused. Bitcoin is money, so nobody's going to give it to you for free. If you want some, you can buy it through Coinbase, or you can ask on reddit. But it's kind of like asking for money in the street. It's not a play toy, you'd be like a beggar. People here can be pretty generous with tips sometimes though.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:27:27
I see. Yeah, if it's just the public address on the front, then you can't do anything with it except verify the balance. If the private key is on the back, then you can take it to a site like coinbase or blockchain.info and import it. I think they both have tools for importing from a private key, you can either enter the private key manually or scan the QR code that represents it, and they'll just sweep the money into your account.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:31:46
Funds on Coinbase are pooled.  You don't have access to your own private keys on Coinbase, you only have access to a sort of cloud account.  They are not constantly moving your private keys back and forth between physical safety deposit boxes, there's no way that would be physically possible.  Instead there are a set of addresses they own that are "cold", and 90% of the money users deposit is sent to them.  The other 10% is the "hot" wallet, that is used for all transactions on the site.  Probably when the hot wallet reaches a certain threshold, they sweep some of it into cold storage.
90% of your funds are in cold storage because in a sense you own a fraction of the cold storage that is equivalent to your fraction of the total pool of bitcoin on Coinbase - not because they actually moved individual keys that are specific to you anywhere special.

I mean if you're selling an amount that small, it'll be an off-blockchain transaction as well.  They'll just move that btc back to their pool and then credit your bank for the appropriate amount, without it ever being broadcast to the blockchain.  They had a blog post about this [here](  At least I think that's how it'd happen.  Honestly I never sell anyway so I don't know. :)

Can't tell if sarcasm or not...  If so, it sounds like the real criticism should be directed at the core assumption there, which is that world GDP will be converted to bitcoin?  Not really sure I get why you're doubting the 90% will be lost, if you are.
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:07:30
90% of all bitcoin will be lost due to users trying to be their own security experts.  In the long run, this alone will account for one order of magnitude of bitcoin's price.

Selling bitcoins chews through the order books.  Each bitcoin you sell is sold at a lower price than the last one.  The price of 173,000 BTC is *not* 173,000 * spot price.  The spot price does not represent all bids, only the highest bid at the time of the last trade.  Here's how you take market depth into consideration: 
1) Go to bitcoin.clarkmoody.com
2) Click "Show calculators" at the top
3) Enter 173000 under "Amount to sell in BTC"
At the time of this post, that's about **$38,000,000**.  So the article is right.
For smaller amounts of bitcoin, (your amount * spot price) is a reasonable calculation, because the sale wouldn't go very deep through the order book.  For large amounts, it makes a huge difference.

I think you only have to wait for your first purchase to clear.  Once it clears, then you can have as many simultaneous purchases and sells as you want.  The only other way I think would be to add a second bank account and make a purchase with that.

Well Coinbase isn't an exchange so they're probably not making an on-demand purchase just for you when you make the buy.  They've already got a pool of coin and they'll just move that small part of it to your account.

No, it's just an estimate.  A large fraction of bitcoins are assumed to be lost given the amount of time they have existed and not moved.  Anectodally, we hear stories about things like this happening all the time.  Just last month 7,500 were lost at once in a landfill.  That only needs to happen about 30 times for *an entire 1% of the currency to be lost*.  Just think of all the keys lost to 10,000 coin wallets because back in 2009 it was still considered a novelty.  And mistakes are only going to keep continuing as bitcoin grows more popular.
I'm not being hyperbolic, I actually think 90% is a reasonable assumption and I think over 50% of the bitcoin mined to date is already permanently inaccessible.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:39:13
I am indeed taking that into account and I believe the price may still be too high.
By that logic everyone on planet earth should buy tomorrow, and all fiat currencies should be liquidated into bitcoin immediately.  So as long as we're below roughly $50,000,000/coin, we'll be "correcting."
That's just not what a correction is.  Up and to the right is not "correction," it's discovery and growth.  Correction is when there is a rough expected value, and the trend line moves towards it after having been skewed unreasonably higher or lower than it.  The move *away from* the expected value (like this case) is not a correction.  Often you can't tell what the expected value is until you have the benefit of hindsight.  It's actually kind of pointless to debate until we can look back and see where the actual correction happened.
