I believe he's referring to allowing you not only to 'refill' your bitcoins that you spend, but also to be able to refill + 10 or 20% of the purchase, of course paying for the full amount chosen either way.

The interesting thing is that now that Coinbase's price is greater than or equal to Gox's, coins can slowly seep out of Gox and into Coinbase with no loss in cashing out.

It hooks into a blockchain.info account for the bitcoin address stuff and just uses the unconfirmed transaction as a confirmation.

I just figured a merchant could glance over at their blockchain account and have blockchain tell them about double spends.
