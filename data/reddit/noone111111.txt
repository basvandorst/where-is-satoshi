You said you're protected from civil asset forfeiture due to them being unable to seize what they can't get to.
That doesn't make any sense. The whole point of any currency is to convert it into some sort of assets. Civil asset forfeiture can claim all sorts of assets, not just cash. So if you use bitcoin to buy some sort of asset, that asset can now potentially be taken.
In any case, if the IRS comes knocking, you better be able to show them where all the money came from and how you paid for everything you have. They'll dig for years and the burden of proof will be on you. Audits are not fun or easy to game.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:38:21
So they can't get to your bitcoins. So what? Are you going to buy anything with those bitcoins?
If you have a house, or car, or TV or anything, they can just seize those things.
Bitcoin's value is the same as any other thing -- it can buy stuff. If you can't buy stuff without it getting taken, then all you have are a bunch of bitcoins that can't be spent.

It's not at all innocent until proven guilty when it comes to the IRS. If they question your taxes, you have to proven it and the burden of proving it is on you. You have to gather all your account statements and match up all the deposits with all your sources of income. If you can't show them where all the income is coming from, you will lose and they'll demand taxes and penalties on it, or something worse depending on the extent.
I got audited millions in income and they were asking about a mere $10,000 discrepancy, as if I was trying to scam them out of a mere $4,000. In reality, I had just randomly deposited $10,000 in various forms that didn't match up perfectly with my income. Fortunately, I also found greater than $10,000 in additional expenses and deductions and we agreed to call it a wash, and by not amending my return, the time limit for being audited again would lapse.
So not only did I have to pay for the accounting work, I didn't get to reclaim those expenses. It was just worth it not to reset the time limit on being audited.
And I didn't do anything wrong. They didn't have to prove anything. I had to prove everything. If I couldn't, I'd be in some serious shit.
Will they wonder where you got your food or microwave from? No. Will they ask where you paid for your expensive car or house? Yes.
They'll look at your taxes, they'll look at your employment/business income, they'll look at your historical balances, they'll look at all your deposits and withdraws, and they'll look at your lifestyle. If anything looks suspicious, they'll pursue it.
The IRS is notorious for looking at people's lifestyles and auditing them. Other countries do the same. Italy started pulling over people in exotic cars, taking their names down, then cross referencing their income tax to see if they can afford it. 
And at the end of the day, you really can't buy much with bitcoin without there being records. Buy something on Amazon? Amazon will have your customer details and show you paid with bitcoin. Who knows what they secretly report too.
Don't fuck with the IRS. They are brutal and will dig deeper than you think. I literally gave up thousands of dollars just to avoid the mere possibility of being audited again.

They're not going to look at your bitcoin account, they're going to look at your normal bank accounts and check that the credits/debits make sense. If they don't, flags will go off and they'll start asking a lot of questions. They'll look at your car, look at your house, ask about employment, etc. They'll add all this up and then see if it makes sense. It's really easy to figure out if someone isn't reporting significant amounts of income.
Also, big ticket items always have a paper trail. Your car has to have a title and records of who owns it, sale price, etc. Your house will have a deed that needs to be on file someplace, taxes will need to be paid, etc. You'll have insurance. If they see you spent money from your normal bank account in another location, they'll ask how you got there. The government can get access to airline data as well. Any online site will have information about shipping stuff to you. It's also illegal in many place to have undeclared foreign bank accounts, so you can't go that route either. Even simply failing to declare a foreign bank account or investments can carry 5-figure fines.
Sure, you'll be able to spend money in person, but what are you really going to spend it on that makes the anonymity worth the hassle? Is hiding a couple thousand dollars in food and clothing purchases really worth it and the risk of getting caught?
You're also assuming the government will be fine with completely anonymous digital spending forever. Once it starts effecting their ability to collect taxes, they'll just create regulation which forces business who accept bitcoin to keep track of all transactions over $X. They'll also say all Bitcoin wallets must be declared just like any foreign bank account.
An anonymous financial system isn't desirable and doesn't work. It might be fine for small, meaningless purchases, but nothing of significant due to the inherent risk associated with it. You'd have no recourse for getting scammed without revealing you account.
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:08:50
I've been audited and I'm quite wealthy. I appreciate the security of transactions not being anonymous, having trusted and reliable 3rd parties on both ends of a transaction, and recourse for recovering funds.
There is no benefit to being anonymous other than doing something illegal. Unless you're just trying not to pay taxes, then all you do is potentially harm the integrity of the transaction and make attempts at recourse more difficult. You subject yourself to complete loss all for the sake of remaining anonymous.
Let me ask you a few questions:
How do you remain anonymous while trying to get your money back in a disputed transaction?
What happens if you're computer is compromised and someone transfers all your coins?

Nonsense article. Anyone can fork BTC and create coins of undetermined value whether you want them or not.
The only logical solution and the one the IRS will most certainly use will be a tax upon sale. BTC is property. It doesn't matter how you break that property up, just what you sell and how much you sell it for.

@_date: 2017-11-13 01:15:18
No one benefits from that. Poor people don't even benefit from that.
There are literally hundreds of millions of middle class people who can run full nodes with more than 1MB blocks. It's not expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:24:22
That doesn't mean only banks can afford it. In fact, tech companies who are also very interested in fintech would be just as inclined to pursue it. Heck, Netflix isn't even that big and it already accounts for like 40% of Internet traffic at peak hours. Imagine Google, Facebook, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, China Mobile, ATT, etc.
Vast numbers of people and companies can meet these storage and bandwidth needs now and in the future. If you want to make a business out of it, then it shouldn't really be a problem.
I personally don't think it's important that millions of average, or even poor people, need to run one. I mean, I don't even care or want to run one even today, and I most certainly could afford to run one with much more significant storage and bandwidth requirements with ease.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:44:13
They'll need on-chain scaling regardless, so why wait? You can't do every thing off-chain, otherwise what would be the point of the main chain in the first place? If you do Visa-level transactions off-chain, you can be certain that on-chain will have still exploded far beyond what 1MB blocks can handle.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:31:41
I'm talking dollar cost of running nodes given various requirements.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:07:45
So in your opinion there will be no transactions on the main chain, is that correct?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:54:17
8MB every 10 minutes is about 1.3MB per minute.
Streaming Spotify is at least 1.2MB per minute. You can imagine how much data a Netflix show in 1080p or 4K is.
8MB every 10 minutes is 1152MB per day. Average household broadband usage per month in the US is nearly 200GB.
There are more than enough people in the US, Europe, and Asia with enough bandwidth to handle this easily. Maybe poor people in Africa might have issues, but anyone who actually wants to do it should have no problem.

Block times aren't the issue. I have no problem waiting 10 minutes for a block given BTC current uses. However, block times are not 10 minutes for everyone. Only so many transactions can fit in each block.
I don't support one or the other. I have large amounts of both since BCH was "free" and I hold it as a hedge. I just don't see the reason not to increase block size to speed up overall transaction rates while other solutions are found for the grander scheme of things.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:32:23
That doesn't make it a good idea or reason though. If forking and pruning makes sense, it should be done.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:09:23
No source, it's just a matter of large numbers. With 1B transactions per day, even if a fraction of a percent need settlement on the main chain, the main chain would get millions of transactions.

What exactly would need to be tested? We know for certain that small increases are very manageable. Maybe not 4GB blocks, but definitely 2MB or 4MB.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:47:03
How so? People running nodes can't afford a little more bandwidth and an extra hard drive?

@_date: 2017-11-13 01:37:46
Yeah, so at 1MB anyone can do it at home.
I'm wondering (since I'm too lazy to do it myself) how much it would cost to run a full node with 8MB blocks since your home internet might not cut it. You'd probably need some commercial service/hosting.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:20:05
This is precisely my thought. I don't really understand why people aren't against raising the block size in the short-term.

Plenty of wealthy individuals could also afford it. There are lots of those in the world too.
 
In any case, I'm not advocating 1GB blocks because it still wouldn't enable a visa/mastercard environment. I'm just saying I think you could increase block size enough to solve current headache while working towards a more permanent solution that is hoped for in the future.
Right now there are too many transactions and increase adoption will make this worse. Even if 2MB or 4MB blocks aren't enough to totally alleviate the problem, it would still help with little downside. Faster is better in the now, even if it won't cut it 10 years from now.
Bitcoin has to function well in order to grow. It could definitely function better right now with bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:20:19
Ultimately though, some transactions have to hit the main block chain. If they don't, then what's the point of the main chain any longer?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:58:35
This doesn't really make sense in any sort of real problem solving. It's known that 1MB will never be enough, nor will 2MB, if we're talking wide-scale adoption. Not moving to 2MB would be like not putting air in your tire until you can fix the leak. Sure, you need more air and you need to fix the leak, but you can't just drive around with no air in your tire. You pay $.50 for some air that you know will escape for the sake of being able to drive still in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:55:00
100K... 300K... doesn't matter because people would lose their shit if it went any lower than 1MB.
The reality is that not everyone needs to run their own node and there is nothing wrong with it taking some investment to run one.
The world should not cater to the lowest common denominator. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:26:49
I don't see how it would become centralized. Some people see it like that, but I really have no idea why.
Also, 8MB blocks are the limit, but it doesn't mean they'll be the norm. Maybe they'll be big for a couple days and then they'll be small again. There are only so many transactions...

Not everyone can afford to do everything. It's normal and there is nothing irresponsible about it. Let the people who want to invest some money into it do it. It's not *that* expensive. There are plenty of commercial hosting services that can accommodate it very reasonably.

@_date: 2017-11-12 02:00:36
I think that whether it's enough or not isn't that big of a deal. I mean, even if you doubled it and it still wasn't enough, you'd still be seeing improved throughput of transactions. More is always going to be better than less in this sort of situation.
I think that's inaccurate. Adoption is growing considerably in the short-term. Maybe not adoption in terms of constant usage, but adoption in the sense of maybe a single, initial transaction for a newcomer.
I have a lot of data on this kind of thing and the times when the transactions begin to fill up coincide with huge user growth. If hundreds of thousands of people are buying their first BTC ever each day, they are definitely going to be creating some transactions.
I don't really buy into the spam transaction line too much. Maybe there is some, but there is also an enormous increase in the amount of legit transactions.

14.8TB is not that much. You can purchase commercial hosting that will handle this.
I disagree that everyone should be or needs to be able to run a full node on whatever they have through their residential internet with no real additional cost.

I agree that it's not a long-term fix, but long-term fixes take a long time to develop, as we've seen. There are short-term issues that can be remedied. There is nothing inherently wrong with a temporary fix to solve a temporary issue while better solutions can be worked on.
I think someone said it well -- just because we know our current rockets aren't going to cut it for expanding into the solar system (or leaving it), doesn't mean we have to wait until we have FTL drives to explore.

I personally don't think it would work well at all. I think an inflationary system is best and the ability to print money.

There is one really simple scenario that kills BTC: One big government "attacks" it, particularly someone like China. China doesn't play by any rules and can shut down/take over every BTC related asset in China. They can ban BTC tomorrow, imprison whoever they want in China, take over all the mining operations, etc. People think crypto is secure and that they alone control their coins, but in China, you don't. The government can take anything and everything from you. Hell, for all you know, the Chinese government already controls almost all of the Chinese network.

They don't do that. Bank leverages deposits on hand, not total deposits.
Loaning on $10 out of $11 to buy homes does not mean you've created 10x your deposits. It means you've converted $10 of your $11 into housing equity that pays interest. This is why people get paid interest in their bank balances. If banks kept 100% of your deposits on hand, you would not get paid interest and you would simply pay fees to cover the cost of their services. Likewise, if banks kept 100% of their deposits, you would not be able to get a loan since there would be no real organized way to borrow money from anyone.

I'd like to point out that vast amounts of people had unbelievable opportunities over the last 8 years. The markets are back at all time highs and any contributions made over the years have gained massively. Furthermore housing has recovered considerable (and arguably overextended itself again) and tons of people had opportunities to buy at low prices, see tons of appreciation, and get mortgages at all-time low rates.
Young adults are not priced out of the housing market. They may be priced out of NYC and SF, but not everywhere. The suburbs continue to offer affordable housing for people with decent credit, an OK income, and a level of financial responsibility associated with housing. At 3.5%, most people should be able to afford mortgages on decent housing.
Pensions funds are pension funds. Such is investing. Private companies with large outstanding pension liabilities have only themselves to blame.
Hey, no one held a gun to anyone's head and made them buy houses they couldn't afford. Everyone -- banks, individuals, investors -- were loving the bubble. No one was complaining in 2006, but when shit hit the fan, no one wanted to own up to their poor decisions. The smartest ones got out first.
I do not feel one bit sorry for any large institutional investor who got burned. I don't believe for even a second that people were somehow duped into buying $1B worth of MBS. They knew the risks, they knew it was garbage in many cases, but they didn't think the party would stop.
The housing bubble didn't have to happen. JPM could have been wrong and housing could have kept chugging along. There is no scientific reason for what happened. Sentiment changed on a dime and shit hit the fan when it did.

Jamie Dimon and JPM have a history of being right far more than they are wrong. You don't weather the financial crisis like they did, avoid a significant amount of the problems that destroyed others, and go on to become what is probably the world's biggest and best run bank outside of SOE in China (which may be bigger but certainly aren't better run.)
Jamie Dimon is about 100000x more qualified to talk on finance and financial instruments than anyone here, and he's seen far more of global finance than anyone here.
If you think he does't know anything about BTC or blockchain technology, you're sorely mistaken. JPM employs very smart people in tech as well.

It sold off from $5000 to $3000 in like a week. You could have probably bought massively during that time.
Buying large stakes in things doesn't mean just buying blindly every day for a set amount. You could, but you could also just take advantage of volatility.
And again, if it's going to $8T in overall value, who cares? The buyer will get 5% on his previous day's purchase too, so win/win.

It doesn't even make sense to be afraid since at any time they could accumulate large amounts of it without even blinking.
Imagine JPM buys $6.5B in BTC. That would mean they would have 10% of BTC at today's levels. Keep in mind that is only like 3 months of cash flow for JPM.
Now, for banks to be afraid of it, it would have to go up to many trillions in market cap. What is 10% of many trillions? It's hundreds of billions. It's possibly trillions.
So big banks could own vast amounts of the total BTC in circulation, and they'd still be doing all the same stuff they do now -- trading, lending, advising, wealth management.
Big banks deal in assets, not necessarily fiat. If the world changes to debt and credit and financial instruments tied to BTC, JPM will start dealing in that. It's not hard to do.

Politics have been a mess for ages. I believe the Fed is creating a bubble by keeping interest rates pointlessly low since most businesses have more cash than they know what to do with and low rates encourage risk taking by those that probably shouldn't be. I think it was good to lower them for awhile and helped a lot, but I think it is long overdue now.
I don't think Tesla should be able to issue debt at the levels it does. I don't think Apple should be able to borrow $100B at insanely low rates just to avoid repatriation of funds and to buy back shares. I don't think 50 or 100 bps should be the difference between delinquency and good standing regarding loans.
Fed rates need to go up because it's obvious no one needs the money and anyone living or dying by a 100 bps most likely should, well, die.

My point was merely that for ever new car you could buy with $X, there is a used car that's better for that same price. I used Lamborghini purely because Lambos are popular in crypto.
It works the same with normal cars to though. You could buy a brand new E-Class, or you could just buy a slightly used S-Class for the same price. Sure, it's maybe a couple years older and has 25K miles, but aside from the mileage and year, it's probably the exact same car as a new S-Class.
I almost always buy used high-end cars because the depreciation is quite significant in the first year or two, while the car itself is still practically new. Sure, you sacrifice being able to spec it 100% to your liking, but there are usually more than enough excellent specs out there that you can live without yellow stitching in exchange for $70K in savings.

It's worth noting that trading revenue is not just JPM trading stocks and bonds like you and I do. They do all sorts of market making.

No one said it wouldn't have upward pressure, but there is plenty of evidence that buying a few percent of a $65B market cap asset over the course of a year doesn't drastically effect the price.
Just look at hedge funds that quietly acquire large stakes in large companies. They don't jump 1000% during that period. Hell, it's entirely possible that buying that much would merely keep the price flat in the event that it normally would be selling off.

I'm not sure you entirely understand what banks do...
Also, people would store BTC with banks for:
A) Better security
B) Useful services
C) To gain interest on their bank balance, which banks then lend out once again in a fractional reserve method
BTW, banks are not lending money that entirely doesn't exist. They are lending money against assets. A run on a bank doesn't mean the bank doesn't have the value of your money, it means the bank doesn't have liquidity. What it does have are assets that your money is backing. If you deposit $200K and they lend out $180K and you go to withdraw $200K, you'll find that the bank only has $20K for you but also a lien on a $180K asset and the cash flow associated with it. Your available cash vanished, not the value of that cash.

I think you need to be more clear on what a deposit means. If I go to a bank and deposit $100, that bank cannot lend $1000. What they can do is lend $90. That $90 could then end up at another bank that would retain $.90 and lend $8.10. This happens over and over and naturally has a limit.
Remember, we loan money against assets (usually). The reason we can do this is because we can in fact create value out of thin air -- it's called labor, among other things.
So when someone deposits $100 in one bank and then $1000 of debt is created via cascading deposits and loans, that seemingly newly created $900 is actually $900 worth of brick, mortar, wood, time (labor), etc.
BTC does not stop fractional reserve banking. So long as you put your BTC in a bank, they can loan it, and then another bank can loan that, etc. 
At the end of the day, economics isn't science. It's man made. We do definitely create money out of thin air at times, and the should create inflation. It's not mandatory though. You can have deflation.

To be fair, where was the due diligence of the buyers of this junk? Who is buying $1B worth of sub-prime MBS and can't figure out how junky it is while everyone on Wall Street seems to know? No one was complaining about their great returns on garbage subprime MBS leading up to the collapse. They were all riding the gravy train until they realized housing overheated and there were no buyers left.
The CEO of JPM obviously knew subprime might collapse, so why didn't AIG when insuring it or people buying all this garbage?
People wanted exposure to what they thought was a never-ending increase in prices. They took a risk and got burned.
To be fair, the buyers of these crap MBS probably would have done halfway decent had they not just unloaded them for pennies on the dollar. Prices collapsed for 5 years and now all of a sudden housing has roared back to where it was and they could have easily been renting those properties and working with owners to make smaller payments.
These guys were idiots, got burned by smarter guys, got mad that they were idiots, didn't want to just play the long-game and so they sued.

You can actually secure anything with anything. If you have an asset (say gold or diamonds or whatever), you can borrow against it so long as someone is willing to take a stake in a less than liquid asset.
Also, money isn't being wished into existence. The money should be going into loans and those loans should be backed by "assets," assets that were produced via labor or resources. Assets can be many things. You can also make unsecured loans if that money is backed by the potential "labor" (job/income) of the borrower, assuming you trust their creditworthiness.
So when a bank with $10 in deposits loans out $9, that $9 is now equity in a home for example. The $9 that the seller received is deposited in another bank, and $8.10 is loaned out and becomes $8.1 of equity in another home. That cascade has a limit and eventually stops. The multiplying amount is typically considered to be total deposits * (1/reserve requirement).
Was money created out of thin air? Kinda, but that's because we create value out of thin air all the time -- labor, time, natural resources.
That's not to say countries can't just print new money backed by nothing. They definitely can. This should create inflation.

Well, to be fair, a bank going bust does not mean you lose 100% of your money. The banks deposits should be overwhelmingly connected to assets and you have a claim against those assets when liquidated. You $100K should be equity in some sort of asset or performing loan. The guy who bought a house with your deposit does not just get a free house. He still pays on it and someone will buy it, at which point the proceeds will go to you in some form or another.
Naturally liquidated assets and the fees associated with the process could mean you get less than you're owed.
A bank failure does not mean you lose the majority of it. In fact, you'll quite possible lose nothing at all if it's acquired by a healthy bank.

Well, under that definition anything can be a currency with varying degrees of practicality.
I think it is a requirement for BTC to really be considered a viable currency. The fact that everyone still talks about how much fiat a BTC is worth is very telling. It's far closer to a commodity than a currency.
Until you price things in BTC and make the terms of the transaction in BTC, I'm not convinced it's a real currency.
Ask yourself if BTC is closer to gold, oil, or USD/EUR/GBP/Yen/RMB. I think it will be much closer to one of the first two, but just happens to be more practical to transact in.

No guarantee of that. Commodities and stocks are regulated, but they can also be volatile. Even fiat can be volatile. If USD, EUR, JPY can swing even a few points quite easily, then BTC will be probably swing a heck of a lot more.
Currencies should have enormous amounts of value. So long as the total value of BTC is so low, it will be enormously volatile, regulated or not.
Further, it's an issue of it not being the national currency of anyone, so no one's expenses are in it. It can be very risky to do sales in one currency and then expenses in another. Imagine selling a product in BTC, having expenses in USD, and then BTC tanking 10%. You possibly just loss a heck of a lot of money since you can't just put off your expenses until BTC goes back up. Or imagine returns. You sell something in BTC, your production cost was in USD, but not they return the product and want a refund in BTC that has now gone up. Now you owe them more BTC in USD terms than the product was sold for.
BTC has a lot of uphill problems to solve and it will be volatile for a very long time to come.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:20:57
I think you're mistaken. What happens to a $65B stock if you buy $1B of it over the course of a year? Not much. It happens all the time. Hedge funds slowly accumulate stakes then reveal them, causing decent by not massive jumps in the price.
BTC has enough volume to allow people to build massive stakes without significant volatility upward.
I could buy $1M of BTC right now and have no effect on the price. I could probably buy $5M and have no effect on the price. So add $5M in volume to BTC every day for a year. Chances are the price isn't going to move much and you'd have $1.5B in BTC in just a single year.
You greatly underestimate the volume and availability of BTC. 24hr volume on Gdax alone was $40M. Buying a few percent of that each day isn't going to do much harm.

I think you misunderstand how banks work and what they do.
Banks cannot create gold, but if you give them a bunch of gold they can leverage that into all sorts of things.
The denomination of their assets is irrelevant. So long as people deposit something of value, they will leverage it and lend it, and they will hedge it accordingly.
They will still provide wealth managements services, they will still make loans, they will still advise clients, they will still offer all sorts of financial services.
Banks will exists no matter what currency is king.

It's not a currency in the sense that nothing is actually priced in BTC. Everything is priced in fiat and then they just spit out a BTC conversion. Also, the terms of the sale will always be legally considered to be fiat, so even if you pay in BTC, the transaction is legally in fiat and what you'd get back upon refund is fiat equal to what you paid in fiat at that time.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:27:33
That's kind of the same thing. If you were to take a $100 deposit and consider it the 10% reserve, then you could loan out $900. This should be the same though my example where you take a $100 deposit, keep $10, loan $90. Then keep $9 and loan $81, etc across numerous banks.
You could in theory then do it infinitely in all sorts of ways, however there is not infinite demand for credit. At the end of the day though, all of these deposits and credit created out of thin air should have some assets or cash flow backing them.
Also, they would be able to credit spendable credit on the blockchain just like they create spendable fiat now. They wouldn't be able create spendable credit equal to the total balance of accounts, but this is no different than FRB with fiat.
Remember, the banks are able to operate like this because a) there is the assumption that people don't try to spend/withdraw all their money at once and b) banks have cash flow due to lending.
It is perhaps difficult to imagine how this all works because the fact is that we're still talking about the value of BTC in fiat, not simply BTC. It's hard to imagine how a financial system operates solely with a finite currency like BTC. Lending becomes kind of weird with a deflationary currency. It requires things like negative interest rates and assumptions about how people will behave in such a climate.

I'd like to point out that vast amounts of people had unbelievable opportunities over the last 8 years. The markets are back at all time highs and any contributions made over the years have gained massively. Furthermore housing has recovered considerable (and arguably overextended itself again) and tons of people had opportunities to buy at low prices, see tons of appreciation, and get mortgages at all-time low rates.
Young adults are not priced out of the housing market. They may be priced out of NYC and SF, but not everywhere. The suburbs continue to offer affordable housing for people with decent credit, an OK income, and a level of financial responsibility associated with housing. At 3.5%, most people should be able to afford mortgages on decent housing.
Pensions funds are pension funds. Such is investing. Private companies with large outstanding pension liabilities have only themselves to blame.
Hey, no one held a gun to anyone's head and made them buy houses they couldn't afford. Everyone -- banks, individuals, investors -- were loving the bubble. No one was complaining in 2006, but when shit hit the fan, no one wanted to own up to their poor decisions. The smartest ones got out first.
I do not feel one bit sorry for any large institutional investor who got burned. I don't believe for even a second that people were somehow duped into buying $1B worth of MBS. They knew the risks, they knew it was garbage in many cases, but they didn't think the party would stop.
The housing bubble didn't have to happen. JPM could have been wrong and housing could have kept chugging along. There is no scientific reason for what happened. Sentiment changed on a dime and shit hit the fan when it did.

Pull up the BTC vs gold charts. Pull up BTC vs inflation charts.
JPM offering gold as an alternative to BTC does not mean they are connecting or relating them, but rather that they are correcting misguided and uninformed opinions on it for clients who don't know any better.
It's like saying, "Hey, if you're concerned about inflation, you should be considering gold or certain treasuries instead of bitcoin because there is no data to support that bitcoin is a reasonable hedge."

That's not the point. To be scared of bitcoin, you have to believe it will go up in price massively. Bitcoin is no threat to anything if it stays where it is. Bitcoin at $3500 means nothing in the scope of finance and banking.
So if he's scared then that means he believes it could go up in price massively. If he believes it could go up in price massively, then he could just buy $10M, $20M, $100M and make many billions anyway.

Jamie Dimon JPM stock -&gt; $0
Jamie Dimon $100M bitcoin -&gt; $10B
Why would he care? Why wouldn't he just buy BTC and wait to get 10x richer than he is today?
The answer is that he's not scared because he really does believe it's crap and destined to fail in the end. And obviously JPM doesn't just deal in fiat. No matter whether BTC becomes the new global currency or not, JPM will still have tons of customers and still trade assets and advise clients and make loans.

I really don't think it would.
BTC has significant volume such that you can accumulate millions without effecting the price much.
Gdax alone had 24h volume of $40M. Would trying to buy another couple million each day really effect the price? I don't think so. 
Would putting in a $6.5B buy in one day effect the price? Yes. Would anyone in their right mind do that? No. You accumulate stakes quietly and strategically so as not to effect the price out of your favor. Hedge funds do this all the time. They buy decent sized stakes in massive companies and price changes are minor during that phase.

Politics have been a mess for ages.

I don't think Tesla should be able to issue debt at the levels it does. I don't think Apple should be able to borrow $100B at insanely low rates just to avoid repatriation of funds and to buy back shares. I don't think 50 or 100 bps should be the difference between delinquency and good standing regarding loans.

It's not possible and wouldn't make any sense. No one would buy anything because the interest payments would be too high and because they'd be buying assets that are quickly depreciating. Deflation will often make people stop spending money.
Likewise there would be no incentive to lend for mortgages because they'd be lending against assets that are decreasing in value, hence their loan is not secured.
Also, high interest rates would make most loan too expensive.
A $250K loan at 4% today has $179K in interest paid over the life of the loan and your asset should have appreciated more than a couple percent each year.
At 15% you'd have paid $887K in interest and your house would be worth less than the $250K you paid for it.
Why on Earth would anyone buy a house? Why would any borrow any money at all?
The reality is that no one has any idea what the system would look like with a deflationary currency.

At the end of the day, consumers surely knew what they were buying and whether they could afford it.

They can physically harm you and your family. They do it regularly. This is China, not the US. If they want your BTC, they'll take everything they can beat/force out of you until they think they've got most of it.
They can take everyone's hardware, they can legally hack you, shut down your internet, shut off your electricity. They control all the utilities in the country. Pretty much ever necessity is a SOE. They can really do whatever they want when push comes to shove.
BTC people have no friends in powerful places. This isn't like China attacking a global company and having to answer to large countries that will retaliate. This isn't like harming your economy on the global stage and discouraging foreign investment.
This is China saying fuck you to some nobody Chinese citizen. No one cares what happens and no one can do anything to stop it.

That would only happen in a traditional BTC-like network. Why would they implement a blockchain like that? Most likely you'd implement some sort of proof of stake or deposit/bond/escrow worth 100s of millions of dollars. If you do something shady, the network will attempt to fix it, take your $500M, and then blacklist you.
Heck, you could even limit the amount of hashing power people are allowed to commit in BTC-like network such that no one could just overpower the rest. Private blockchains will be designed to be cost effective and that will be quite easy to do since it will not be public and the parties will be "trusted" in the first place.
Imagine what would happen to a financial institution who attempted to do something wrong/illegal and was then cut off from everyone else and the global system? Their shareholders, their executives, etc would all lose vast amounts of money as the stock price collapsed.
This kind of behavior would be an existential threat to any bad actor.

Yeah, but the price in BTC fluctuates, the price in fiat does not. All these companies/people are doing is changing the BTC price.
The property that sold in Dubai sold for $X and Y BTC, but whether you bought it in BTC or USD or gold or Ether or Picassos, I guarantee the contract was in fiat and that you owed the equivalent of $X regardless of what the price of BTC was doing.
No one would ever sign a contract in advanced in a super volatile currency since come the day of the closing, the price could have been massively lower. If the contract was done in BTC, you can be sure that the BTC value was determine the exact moment that the payment was going to be sent.
So yeah, in reality it wasn't sold in BTC, it was just transacted in BTC.

It's much more risky to accept a currency that you're not operating with. Euro can go up or down, but if your expenses are in Euro, so what?

While that may be so, why would anyone want to take an unnecessary risk? There is no real upside to accepting BTC. If you wanted BTC, you would just buy it. The risk is almost entirely to the downside.
A major reason for this lopsided risk is because no one actually has costs in BTC and margins typically are not that high. Everyone's costs are in various form of relatively stable, local fiat.
Another huge risk would be refunds. If the terms of your transaction are legally in a volatile currency like BTC, but your costs are in fiat, you could suffer enormous losses simply via returns. Imagine you sell something for .003 BTC (roughly $10 today.) Now imagine BTC goes up 20% over the next 30 days (which isn't at all uncommon). The customer wants a refund and you owe it in BTC. Well, your costs are all in fiat so you probably had to exchange a lot of that BTC to pay bills. Now you owe more money than you received on the sale.
It's just not possible to conduct commerce with highly volatile things like BTC. It's subjects sells to needless risk when they could just accept fiat risk free.

I don't know, but it doesn't matter since no one maintains pricing in BTC. Even if it was legal tender, any place accepting it would have dynamic pricing meaning the price of a burger for example would be priced in Yen and would stay the same, and the price you paid in BTC would fluctuate by the moment. You wouldn't know the price until you go to the counter and rung it up, and most likely it would have a slightly worse exchange rate due to fees and volatility.

Buying only causes the price to shoot up relative to what it's really worth. If you attack it, the idea, and its potential future, then you've destroyed the possible value of it. If you destroy it once, you've probably destroyed it for a very long time because once you've shown that you can destroy it once, it will be assumed you can probably destroy it again. The way to destroy a financial system or institution is to make people lose faith in it. Make people lose faith in crypto and you'll destroy them all for a very long time.
Your example is not reality. If BTC is value at $1 and you have the last BTC, the US government won't offer you anything because they don't care. They'll tell you to keep it and good luck. What are you going to do, value it yourself at $1B and try and sell fractions of a coin for millions of dollars? No one will buy your coin because the supply and price would be controlled by the majority holder.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:28:36
What do you think would happen if they said "Tomorrow you have to sell all your BTC if you're a US citizen. After tomorrow it will be illegal to transact in BTC."
The panic selling would absolutely destroy the price of BTC and cause panic selling all over the world. The price was 1/10 of what it was today just a few years ago and with no such pressure. It's pretty obvious that such a turn of events would easily decimate the value.
China could even more easily destroy BTC. They literally can do whatever they want in their country. They will tell you to turn over all your hardware, all your coins, and do exactly as they say or they'll throw you in prison for the rest of your life and destroy your family, just like they do to activists they don't like.
Not saying any of this will happen, but it's really quite easy to do if they really cared.

I suggest you read the more important part. Care to take a guess how well the a large government like the US could manipulate the price and how long they could keep it up? Most likely down to nearly $0 and forever.
This situation isn't to suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation; it still doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus Bitcoin remains a volatile asset thus far.

They don't need to destroy them all, they just need to show they can and will destroy one. Destroy the faith in an idea and you'll destroy them all at the same time.
China could literally destroy BTC overnight if they wanted. They could just take everything from everyone in China -- all the hardware, all the assets, all the people. The only security you have in China is what the government wants you to have. They could walk into every mining operation and say hand it all over right now or we will throw you in jail for whatever we want and we'll destroy your familys' lives as well.

Not at all. The price doesn't go to infinity just because you're trying to buy it all. It will go up slowly and steadily, but if you're already destroyed the value, then it doesn't matter. There is a max value even if there is one guy holding out. And if there are a few hold outs, you'll have either made the usage of BTC so pointless and suspect that no one wants to buy it anymore, or you'll have made an insane profit because you own it all. If BTC is worth trillions and the government owns 99% of it, I'm pretty sure they'll be just fine with that LOL.
BTC is worth $45B right now. The daily volume is already nearly $300M even on slow days. That volume means you could easily buy it up without causing it to skyrocket, not to mention how easily it would be after you "banned" it and destroyed the value. Just tell people they have 24 hours to sell before it's "illegal". You create a panic sell, create insane volume that you're buying into.

Large governments can ban and destroy the value of just about anything, unless there is a large proponent government on the other side of that deal. It doesn't matter how many crypto currencies you can create because such a government can set precedence that destroys the value of such ideas.
If the US banned and tried to destroy BTC (which they could easily do), do you really think ETH and a million others would just stay the course? Nope. They'd all get destroyed. The idea would be potentially mortally wounded.
All monetary systems are simply based on faith in the idea. Loss of faith in a financial instrument or institution is really what kills it. Killing the idea kills the product and the value. It's not like a tangible drug. It's just some imaginary idea where people believe some "thing" has value that can be traded for tangible things.
The US government doesn't care because it's really not that big of problem. The world has far greater problems that criminal BTC activity.

Any investment that I think has significant upside is never spent/exited until that opinion changes or until my investment time frame has changed. Unless you're getting old or missing a significant opportunity, there would be little reason to exit a potentially very successful position, especially if you don't need the cash anyway.
Bitcoin is something that is either way overvalued or way undervalued. If it's fairly valued, then there would be little reason to hold it or transact in it anyway because Bitcoin isn't like a stock or company. It's like gold in that it doesn't produce income or pay dividends. There is really no upside to holding such a "commodity" over local fiat in that case. In fact, it's worse than holding fiat because fiat is vastly easier to spend and to deploy.
The richest people in the world rarely cash out. They borrow, pay interest, and sell only what they have to in order to pay the interest because they know/believe that their investments grow faster than their interest rate.
I'd also point out a very big issue: No one actually accepts BTC as the currency of transaction. When they say they accept BTC, they really mean they're just accepted BTC and converting it for you into fiat. The terms of the sale/transaction are almost always specified in local fiat. You're still buying in USD/Euro/whatever and that's what you'd be back if you wanted a refund.

Moderate inflation is not bad and it's by no means in a state of runaway inflation or looking to be anything even close to it. Most countries can't even create inflation even when they're trying. Look at what inflation has been in the US and the EU in the last 10 years. Heck, Japan hasn't been able to create inflation in decades.
The idea that bitcoin has value because people don't believe in paper money couldn't be further from the truth. If that were the case, why does everyone care about the price so much and why isn't anyone actually transacting in it? All bitcoin transactions are actually in fiat. No one prices anything in BTC or completes transactions in terms of BTC. People are buying/transacting BTC with the sole hope of converting it into fiat at least the same rate they got it for.
Also, barely any commerce is being done with BTC. It's all just going back and forth on exchanges, from USD to BTC to ETH to USD to LTC to EUR etc. This is pretty clear evidence that the vast majority of holders want fiat, not BTC (or any crypto really).
At the end of the day, it's just like anything else and it's worth what someone will pay for it.
I don't really see any more value in BTC than I do in gold. I don't know why gold has much value, but it does, and if people want to give me a bunch of it, I'll take it and convert it into stuff I actually want. At the end of the day, all I care about is what I can convert my BTC/fiat/ETH into -- real estate, labor, food, services, consumer goods, etc.

Gold shot up as a result of fear in 2011, not inflation. Gold is considered a safe haven asset and tends to move inversely with stock, just like bonds. Just look at an "inflation" adjust chart for gold for the last 100 years. It's a wild and crazy chart that shows no real consistency. 
Here's how many ounces of gold it took to buy the SP500 over the last 100 years. Also all over the place and is shown as deflationary for the majority of the time 
You're cherry picking dates and ignoring the massive difference between eras. Household income was $7K in 1969. Ok, well did you adjust for female workforce? Did you adjust for wage discrepancies between men and women? Did you adjust for completely different life styles and technology? Did you adjust for a move from manufacturing to services?
Why compare it to the price of a Camaro and not a large TV or a computer? Why not the cost of college?
These blanket statements about gold and inflation don't make any sense. They don't account for the reality of how life and technology have changed. Sure, it cost more gold today to buy a Camaro, but a Camaro today is nothing like a Camaro from 1969.
Gold is a hedge against inflation only with the aid of financial crisis. Without massive stock market declines, it performs poorly regardless of what inflation is.

Do you have proof of this? From where I'm sitting, the USD, Euro, CNY, JPY, and pretty much every major fiat currency in the world is doing just fine. There is no inherent flaw to fiat, it's merely a matter of running sound national budgets. Also, without fiat, your bank account would either have to have 90% less money in it (since they'd literally have to lend it out), or you'd have a very hard time getting a loan since there would be barely any liquidity without fractional reserve banking.
There is actually no issue with securitized loans. It's a totally normal financial instrument that makes total sense so long as it's being represented accurately.
BTC is no different than fiat. You can't print BTC, but you can create as many crypto currencies as you want. You're seeing this happening practically every day now. Ethereum has gone from almost nothing to challenging BTC practically overnight. What's to stop it from happening over and over and over?

Relative to USD or any other usable currency, for example, it wouldn't be a profit. You'd still have exactly as much value as before.

Can you find any data that supports gold's price relative to inflation? Data doesn't support it and the market is what the market is. It's great to talk about theory, but the reality of gold is such that it has barely budged since the financial crisis, if not went lower, and throughout history hasn't even come close to matching inflation.
At the end of the day, we know what the prices were and what they are. It's not really a question of opinion or philosophy.
