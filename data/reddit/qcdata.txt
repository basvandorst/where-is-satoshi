As a Swede im slowly and (quietly?) leaving the banks. Today i told them to close down my creditcard and the credit i had.
I think the AML has taken a bad turn owerall. You have to prove your/my innocence, they dont have to prove your/my guilty.
Wasn't that the metodhodology of STASI?
I think we have to put more money in the hands of the monetary police to deal wiht true criminals and stop messing with ordinary peoples life. I dont like money laundering, but the way it is fought right now is wrong.
Sweden was the first country to adopt money in the form of paper. They where printed in the year 1661. So why are we slow on "internet money"?

I definitly think you hit the "magic key" to bitcoin.
If we all have a simple/clean/easy to use "wallet" it will break the ice for bitcoin use.
If i would have a wallet on my arm like a watch i will be more than happy to not have to use my phone for payment. I will not either be afraid of losing it since its on my arm.
This is definitly the future.
The first one who integrates a small camera for scanning qr code in this type of device will have a huge impact on the market.
Better than credit card! I want one now!

Public key you say. Its like posting your bank account on the door. A little stupid when compared to "real" money i think....
