Bitcoin is a technological opportunity for the France and its contractors. There is an urgent need not to be distracted by the debate on its status as currency, which could eventually be a decoy. Like many revolutions, inventions cannot be categorized by inventions past and it seems that this is the case of the Bitcoin.
As explained with patience, kindness and pedagogy, Marc Adreessen of Andreessen Horowitz in his article of the New York Times "Why Bitcoin Matters?", Bitcoin is based on disruptive technology that can benefit from a network effect, it means that its value will increase with the contribution of the parties involved in this network. It has four: consumers, merchants, miners (members of the community who operate the network) and technology companies that will build applications based on this invention.
The France that innovates has curiosity. It embraces new inventions to make new applications in respect of its values.
The French Senate has taken a step in conducting a hearing of stakeholders in the field, in which only the French company Paymium represented the bitcoin community and a large number of central organizations which although puzzled by the subject, defend their institutions. Senators have been careful and responsible listening, but this is not enough to reassure companies working on these topics of innovations.
This is a unique opportunity that we have to be at the birth of a new revolution. To this day, we still have the choice to participate fully in giving our talented entrepreneurs a suitable regulation that they expect to conquer new markets.
