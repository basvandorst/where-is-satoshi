I'm not talking about a bank, just a soft wallet like Exodus.
I know exchanges aren't ideal for sitting on BTC so I was just trying to gauge when to xfer my BTC over to Exodus.

That and the pointless memes.
It's very obvious that Bitcoin Cash is going through a pump and dump. The jump to ~4.5k was very sudden and it'll fall rapidly eventually. Combine that with Bitcoin Cash having a lower difficulty, yeah it starts to come together pretty vividly. Day traders gonna day trade.
Bitcoin has been stabilizing for less than a week and people are going crazy. Nothing has even happened yet, except for BTC keeps reaching new maximum prices. 
People are just bored.

Ah my bad. I wasn't thinking of Coinbase as a bank. I'm new to this whole thing. Yeah I plan on buying a hardware wallet soon as I plan to hold for years.

How does a hardware wallet make sure that you get the split altcoin?
I am a new investor and have a trezor on the way but I don't quite understand how the hardware wallet is going to be like "oh I now know how to hold this new currency".
Software update?

Sounds like a close call.
If you need someone to watch after some of that BTC for you and keep it very safe, let me know. ;)

So tired of this shit.

Okay thank you, I'll move it now.

Same thing that happens with most forms of fiat.
Card scanners will be down, most bank registers will be down, banks will be down.

Cool thank you. This is really good information to have.
I will wait until trezor releases their tool. That wallet seems like a better investment every day. :)

Good on you.
