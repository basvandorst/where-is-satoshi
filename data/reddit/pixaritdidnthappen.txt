Oh good, a bunch of people that either don’t understand a technology or are invested in the system that bitcoin intends to destroy, are going to discuss how to regulate that technology. Great idea. 
On an unrelated note I think I’ll ask my dog if I should let him watch the chickens or keep them in their coop? Thanks for the inspiration!

Wow, you just don't get it. You truly don't.  It does not detract from my point. IT IS MY POINT.  They are using the name but not trying to claim they are bitcoin.  They are something else.
Whether people had a problem before the fork or not is in the past and irrelevant.  Your claims are so spurious, such as growth and organic (thanks for the laugh) it doesn't even deserve a response.  You're attempting to gaslight the community by claiming that bcash supporters are not involved in deceitful tactics.
Is bcash the result of a hard fork from Bitcoin? yes
That means Bcash is not bitcoin.  Any claim other wise is a lie. You have a centralized coin that gives you what you want.  Great! So stop crying about Bitcoin and actually try to build something on your own.  The entire bcash sub front page is made up of posts boohooing about bitcoin.  It's so pathetic. 
One more time for you since it doesn't seem to be coming through for you:




do you understand? it is about the dishonesty of the bcash community.




I know you're not going to be convinced by anything I've said.  Just stop claiming bcash is bitcoin and go do something useful.

Hello bcashill123456 thanks for not  reading all of Luke’s comments and trying to frame the facts to fit your agenda. Enjoy your time here in the land of decentralization, we hope you’ll take some of the ideas you find here back to your alt coin sub.

Then why are you such a proponent of bcash? I mean it’s obvious from your post history so don’t be coy. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:06:01
Reading your history and you’re just so obsessed with this sub. If your alt coin is so great why don’t you stop worrying about us, because we don’t even think about you. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:28:59
There are three alts that currently have utility for anything besides trading. But it won’t stop these people from trying to bet on the next big coin. Eth ltc and xmr actually get used as a currency and have real transaction volume.  It’s sad to see people being pulled into these other scam coins.  Now a few coins have great ideas and perhaps they will be useful in years to come but for now they’re nothing more than a white paper and an ocean of hype.

Well you're just having a discussion with yourself it seems, because I didn't make any of the claims you're bringing up.  
I don't even know where to start, you're just making claims out of thin air. I never claimed "most people using Bcash would be stupid enough not to realize they're actually using something different"  you're just completely making that up.
You're once again trying to create a false narrative about bitcoin not being used as a currency, when it clearly is.  It's used as a currency all day, every day.  The current 24h txn volume is 3x greater, than bcash.
Once again, let me be clear.  If this were about a fork, then it wouldn't be discussed.  Nobody is discussing bitcoin gold, or classic, or any other attempted fork....This is about the shady and deceitful tactics of a community, don't try to parse it, don't try to lie and don't try to defend the lie.  That's what this is about.
Get it? This is about the dishonesty of the bcash community.  
do you understand? it is about the dishonesty of the bcash community. 
One. more. time.
**This is about the dishonesty of the bcash community.**
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:04:51
You’re insufferable. Please keep the propaganda in the sub you have for your alt coin. 
You know you’re lying about the use case for bcash. If it were truly about creating a currency then it wouldn’t try to piggyback off of the bitcoin name. You just want to supplant bitcoin with your alt coin and you’re attempting to do so with small lies that grow into larger lies. Bitcoin is a store of value and a currency. Bcash is an attempt at taking over the hard work of a community that created a decentralized currency; bcash is run by greedy megalomaniacs that want control. 
I don’t know why any of you bcash shills bother coming here. You have a sub for your alt coin. It even has the bitcoin ticker symbol as the name and yet you insist on pushing your alt that is not used for anything besides speculation. It’s disgusting and pathetic. 
But by all means keep doing it. Your wasted time and energy on a counterfeit coin will serve you well, at least for my purposes.

AFAIK it’s real. But this just proves my point that I don’t care about a fork. Because I don’t know a thing about diamond besides that it exists and it’s on cmc. It’s the tactics used by the bcash crowd that are abhorrent. Not the act of creating a fork. My hell they even use the bitcoin ticker symbol for their sub. It’s sad.  They need to move on but almost every post in that sub is about this sub or bitcoin and not their alt coin.

@_date: 2018-01-29 05:52:16
While you present a more cogent argument than the others that have replied, you're still attempting to construct a narrative that presents Bcash as Bitcoin, by appealing to the idea of a "True Scotsman" or "original vision", while ignoring the various changes and improvements that were developed and implemented in the Bitcoin network in the years after the whitepaper was released.  In order for that argument to work, many changes and points of progress would have to be stripped from the project, but that of course won't happen as the argument is just a cheap ploy, not an honest appeal. Just as you try to insert the false idea concerning a store of value or a peer to peer cash, which bitcoin is both.
As to the naming convention, it's a clear attempt at subversion and fraud.  The principle concept behind bitcoin is consensus, in many aspects of the project.  Bcash diverges from that principle as it was a clear attempt to force  the preferences of one group over the rest of the community when no consensus could be reached over how a secure, acceptable scaling solution would be implemented.   Presenting the situation as anything else is dishonest just as the tactics used to try and trick others into believing bcash is bitcoin, Bcash is not bitcoin.  It's a clear use of propaganda tactics and has only served to hurt the entire crypto space.  All of this would be avoided by an honest attempt at adopting a name that is not intended to deceive, however the choice to name the fork bcash is indicative of the intentions of the main actors behind bcash.
EDIT: words
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:45:18
No I don't.  I'm not posting about bitcoin gold or diamond or any other real/proposed fork.  The sleazy tactics and dishonesty of the bcash crowd is the problem.  The community behind bcash backs the individuals you named.  Thats the hole in your argument.

The strength of bitcoin is the code and the network. Your argument is weak in the face of monero, doge, ltc, etc... all a derivative of bitcoin. 
If bcash were superior then it would be obvious. It isn’t. It is redundant and centralized. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:19:54
Nobody cares that they forked. The problem is that they try to claim they are bitcoin and try to co-opt the hardwork of a community that built up a reputation for a secure network and protocol over years, by piggy backing off of the name.  
If they didn't try to confuse newcomers, and came up with a completely different name then we wouldn't care.  If the bcash crowd really believed in their tech and code then they would believe that it would succeed on merit alone and stop trying to steal the name of bitcoin.  They could have called it splitcoin: a bitcoin fork.  Forkcoin. bitfork. Anything would have been fine, however, they chose a name to intentionally confuse people into believing they are bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the bicycle of cryptos. Everybody has one and it’s still the most reliable form of relatively fast transportation. Sure a car is faster, but it isn’t always the best option. If I’m going across town then a car is great. If I’m going a few blocks down town a bike is faster and doesn’t require that I find parking.

Now I’m a pretty big bitcoin enthusiast myself but my understanding of Monero doesn’t line up with what you’ve said here. There’s a good reason for darknet market transactions increasingly moving toward monero. Most of the major darknet busts of the past year were made possible because of tracing bitcoin through markets and tumblers back to the wallet owners.  Monero on the other hand has a much better record for retaining anonymity in transactions.

Likely FUD from an institution that wants to become the voice for price signaling.  Building on that, it's likely part of their own investment strategy: spread FUD in order to lower prices for more large purchases. 
Shoot it could even be part of their own market manipulation; coordinated sell off to trigger a larger panic sell, resulting in minimal slippage and big buys on the dip.

Just to be clear then, b2x will definitely fork from the legacy *(BTC) chain and not BCH?
People should just start making hundreds of forks from BCH, name it BCH1-100 for each iteration. Water down the value to nothing. The new logos can be one degree to the left each time. 
*EDIT: has a point. We should refrain from saying "legacy" as it's the only valid bitcoin chain, just call it BTC chain.

Over the past few years there have been several suggestions and attempts at changes to the protocol for Bitcoin.  People started to separate into different schools of thought about how to approach the problems the network has faced during its growth. Things like block size, fees, mining equipment, outside company influence, etc... have all caused major discussion and disagreement in the community.  Because certain topics would dominate the sub and sometimes appear to distract from the topics the sub was designed to discuss, the mods started removing posts about certain topics. This was viewed harshly by a lot of proponents of different views and they started r/btc. It was a good idea at first and I frequented both subs. Particularly because the heavy moderation in r/Bitcoin didn't allow for discussion of the new proposals that I was very Interested in. However, over time the two groups started to spew vitriol And insults at eachother.  R/btc became further marginalized and their discussion devolved into what it is now. This sub has been just as bad at times and gets better when an influx of new users comes around.

While it is true that the 2MB blockers gave in and implemented segwit, that is due to ultimatum set forth by BIP148, not out of their own good will.  The 'compromise' is just their way of giving the *appearance* of control over the ecosystem.  It allows them to save face and avoid the chaos of the Aug 1 deadline of UASF while pushing their agenda of increasing the block size.  In other words, their hand was forced, but they tried to make it look like beneficence.

This. I've told my girlfriend for years she needs to watch the price for a few weeks to understand the type of volatility Bitcoin faces. If she's comfortable with it to buy as much as she's willing to lose. 4 years later she's frustrated I never made her by any....I said I've told you what to do! she finally did a month ago. 
My friend is more risky. He said just tell me when to buy and I'll buy. I said watch the price. He said I see it every now and then just tell me when to buy. I said fine there is a halvening in 5 months, I'd buy before that. He bought $5k of coin that day, and thanks me for the advice often.

Remember everyone, that this is only true on a short timeline. On a long enough timeline, the **best case scenario** is you'll break even. But more than likely, you'll lose money. Best advice: HODL TIL YOU'RE ODL. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:04:55
1. yes
2. if you start mining you can join a mining pool by directing your hash power to that pool
3. yes
4. through an exchange or a service like localbitcoins
5. A mining rig will set you back ~$10,000 USD and the electricity costs would be in the thousands/month.  It's unlikely you'll be able to make money mining and recoup costs for the equipment before you need to upgrade to stay up with the competition. Also don't bother with cloud mining, it's a scam 99% of the time, AFAIK.

I know you think this is clever but the truth is I got in really really low and I didn’t sell at 17k and I didn’t sell at 12k and I realized I knew a long time ago that we re headed to 4K at the very least but I had this idea in my head that I’m true and I hodl. Only to realize that is a suckers game. I immediately felt better after selling (and I didn’t sell everything) but I also felt sad because I finally admitted to myself we re in a long term bear market.

A seat belt isn't necessary to drive to the store, but why not use it if it's an option?
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:17:52
Hey sorry for the late reply. The answer depends on what you want to do. If you plan to sell it soon then it's fine to leave your coins in an exchange wallet, with the conditions that it's for a short amount of time and that it isn't a lot of bitcoin. 
Why? Because when you have coins in their wallet you don't have ownership of the private keys. Basically coinbase hasn't assigned actual "coins" to you yet. Not until you withdraw. This can be an issue if there is ever a major attack on coinbase or if they become insolvent. 
Now if you plan to buy more bitcoin or plan on holding onto your coins for a long time, it would be prudent to move the coins to your own wallet, that way you will control the private keys associated with your Bitcoin. Trustworthy wallets include electrum, airbitz, bread wallet, etc... You need to be responsible too though and keep a copy of the seed and password for the wallet.  I apologize if I over explained this and if you need more info feel free to ask.

Stop calling it an experiment. That's like making a replica of Air Jordans, turning the logo sideways and calling it an experiment instead of a counterfeit. It's a knockoff and an attack on the ecosystem of bitcoin. It's not an alt-coin, it's a counterfeit bitcoin.

Congratulations! I think many of us have similar stories of just not following through. My first attempt at buying btc I had to talk to someone In a chat room and wire them money and then later I never even finished setting up my account with mt gox. All long before the first big rally. But it's good to see we all got here. 
As a note, I assume you meant "stock" as in a supply, but for anybody that didn't pick that up, you should just buy actual Bitcoin, don't buy stock of Bitcoin. And be careful with referring to buying crypto as buying stock. Using common investing terms is misleading to newcomers and forces old-financial-system thinking onto a new technology. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:25:48

This is a good video.  I wish people understood that this is not good for bitcoin.  It essentially waters down the value of bitcoin, that is, if there are miners putting hashing power toward BCH.
It is a little bothersome that this can even occur.  What is to stop multiple wealthy actors from individually creating their own forks and mooching off of the momentum of bitcoin?  That is essentially what has happened here.  I want to just dump the BCH to help in driving down the value so it is no profitable to mine - at the same time, I don't want those same miners coming back to BTC, as they are clearly intent on attacking bitcoin. I'd rather they slowly wilt and die over a period of years while their alt-coin becomes worthless.

I like the sentiment here but I've been around this sub for ~7 years now and I think there are a lot of people in the 1 million club (own 21 bitcoins) and many people with much more than that.  I can say personally that there isn't a price where I'd sell everything, but I have certainly sold some of my early coins. I got into bitcoin because of the ideology, I hodl'd because of the ideology, and the price increase has made it a lot easier to stick around.  Early adopters came for the same reasons.

As do I.  I was looking at different sites today, ones I hadn't visited before and I noticed a few accept bitcoin.  It made me realize that this isn't just about a decentralized currency for the people but it also requires that we change some of our more toxic habits and stop helping to centralize power for large retailers online, and start showing that we want to support commerce from the shops and merchants that support the bitcoin revolution.  Instead of waiting for large retailers to accept btc, we will just build up the small guys and in turn build up bitcoin.

People don't understand money and finance in the first place.  I have to explain how the employee stock purchase plan works several times to my coworkers before they get it. 
There are lots of people that don't use credit cards, loans, 401k, stocks, etc... Because they don't understand any of it.  That's fine. There may not be a day where everybody uses bitcoin. But there will be a day where a significant portion of the population uses it. That's more than enough for journey to the moon. 
But then again, most people don't understand a simple modem/router setup, and yet they use it everyday...we re nerds so we want to explain the details but most people can't, won't, aren't going to get it.

Yes I think the only demoralizing thing about the recent sell offs is that a lot of the big sellers were people that are bitcoin evangelists from the early days. You have these people selling at an ATH that you’d think would have been holding onto their btc for life but instead they cashed out when they sensed a bubble. Can’t blame them free market blah blah blah I know so don’t bother saying it. I’ve been here since 2011 and I’ve seen it all now, doesn’t change the fact that many people claim they don’t care about price only to see them sell at ATH and get out almost entirely. Bring on the downvotes.

At 25 people should be informed enough to make that choice, and if they aren't it's their fault by 25.

It's not the point. You asked for holes in your argument. You have one. Here's another EBay. Here's  another: ovens.  Here's another: using a screwdriver instead of a drill.

I always recommend that people sell if they're uncomfortable with a large dip because they're too attached to the profits at that point and have invested more than they're willing to lose. Otherwise don't panic sell, it's always met with regret.

The problem is that they'll buy offchain and outside of an exchange. They'll find a private client that already owns a massive amount of coins and pay them market value for the private keys.  That way they don't cause any slippage or even pick up any transaction fees.

If 100% of the population voted then it would be clear vote manipulation.  While I agree that the vote wasn't accurate of the views of the people that is complicated by the fact that the state wouldn't allow the vote and people from both sides were afraid to vote.  Regardless, the fact that the state won't allow a discussion has provided greater dissent and more people would now vote for independence than before. 42% is pretty good, but it could be better.

I recently spent a week in Barcelona.  I made it a point to not go out of my way to spend bitcoin, but rather, to see if I would come across any business that accepted bitcoin as I explored the city.  I didn't see a single place with any indication that they accepted bitcoin, unfortunately.  Perhaps that will now change.

True. But that usually causes a spike in price. I was hoping to get back to the $800 but that's long gone. I'll hope for $500. It's just hard to believe anybody is actually trading BCH and that it's even possible to exchange still.

You seem to think that the bank looks at individual account balances, loaning them out in discreet packets. It doesn’t matter if an account has $5 or $550,000. The bank uses an equation to determine what the total **average** of all deposits in all of the accounts is at any given point in time. That is just another entry in their spreadsheet of total available capital they can loan from.

I agree. This was exactly my point. In the OP they used a specific timeline to prove their point, I did the same thing to make the counter point while bringing up benefits and disadvantages to each option.
In reality, you could pick a random set of dates from the lifetime of bitcoin and make your own decision as to whether or not you're statistically likely to have lost or gained value on your original purchase, when weighing the other factors of all your financial options.

For more on securing your account, see here.


 




Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in, custodial bank accounts, or in U.S. Treasuries. 


Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in segregated, custodial bank accounts. 






Posting for further clarity.  Your statement is correct but it requires more information.  Crypto isn't FDIC insured because the FDIC doesn't insure crypto.  Coinbase has other insurance for **their** online holdings of customer funds.  If you are hacked and their investigation is not able to retrieve the funds or it is determined that the hack occurred as a result of your own negligence, then you will not be compensated.  It's definitely more complicated than saying that the crypto is or is not insured, so hopefully I didn't mislead anybody.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:17:27
Because it’s not even accurate. 
First your argument was that the bank doesn't make money from free checking accounts. Then you moved the goalpost to say they don't make money on small deposits.  Then you changed it to being about profit vs. revenue. Now your argument is I didn't get from context you that you were talking about profit vs. revenue.  All trying to get away from the original point that yes a bank makes money from a free checking account.  Furthermore, you're wrong.  The value that a small deposit adds to the overall balance of deposits at the bank, along with the total number of customers, is greater than the cost to the bank for serving that customer.  Because if you have 100 people with only $1000 in the bank, then the bank has $100,000 they can make loans from, while those 100 customers are not costing them more than the interest they are making from the deposits. Get it? Do you understand?
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:40:00
Based on previous events where a price increase happened before a major Coinbase announcement, it's likely that any affect this news would have on price has already occurred.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:54:12
Haha I didn’t need you to tell me how banks work, since that is what I was doing for you. I think it’s clear you know that the argument is sound. The bank makes interest off of your free checking account. You make no interest on a checking account. Even a savings account has a pathetic interest rate but overall it doesn’t even cover the effects of annual inflation. The bank does loan out money based on the average amount of capital available to them via deposits and other options of credit available to them. As you saw in my first reply to the OP there are drawbacks and benefits to different financial options and if someone is not comfortable with the risk of bitcoin then they won’t receive its reward either.

Bitcoin doesn't make sense to everyone and for the narrow set of circumstances for your scenario it wouldn't.  But the bank is making money off of you.  You aren't paying them for their services directly because they are benefiting from having your money stored with them.  
If you had put $10,000 into your checking account in 2014/2015 and didn't touch it, then today you would still have $10,000 in your account and for that entire period of time it was safe, you could access it from your phone, atm, all without incurring any fees from the bank.  You didn't have to worry about viruses, passwords, etc...
If you had put $10,000 into bitcoin in 2014/2015, you would have purchased ~50 bitcoins.  You would have had to be careful with your private keys, your wallet, viruses, etc... You would have to pay mining fees when you used it and you would have had to think about what was happening in the market.  Your $10,000 in 2014/2015 would now be worth ~$300,000 as well.  
There are tradeoffs.  Being your own bank isn't for everyone. There is risk, reward, and opportunity cost for every financial decision we make.

**Incorrect.** In the scenario I just described you are not making any money and the bank is not splitting any profits with you.  


**Incorrect.** It is your loss, as already stated, opportunity cost. You're $290,000 down in the narrow set of circumstances I've created (see what I did there?). You're not making any profit and they are, while you could have invested money in anything else and possibly made a profit.


**Incorrect.** Coinbase is essentially a bank for many people and their funds are insured.

The current theory is that a16z, one of the funds heavily invested in 21.co/earn.com,used the company to purchase btc, likely because they couldn’t buy it directly (legally) as a VC firm. a16z is also a major investor in coinbase.  This could be happening for many reasons. One possibility is a bailout but considering that 21.co only had ~50 employees and received over $100 million in funding, it doesn’t seem as likely that they ran out of money.  Another possibility is that the company was using the resources for mining and this is part of a move to use those coins as a separate entity, or to keep them from being claimed through a bankruptcy. This is all just speculation based on the players involved. However, all in all this isn’t a normal acquisition.

Read my comment again, if it's still not clear, read it again. It's about selectively releasing material and doing so in coordination with state agents.  Wikileaks has been open about the first part of that statement (revealing an agenda) and the second part is evident if you're paying attention.  Maybe I can make this even more clear: it's not about what wikileaks is releasing, it's about how and when it happens and more imporantly, what they *aren't* releasing.

You're welcome to your own opinion on the matter but many of us are convinced that wikileaks worked with the russian government to selectively release materials in order to aid the trump campaign.  You're free to do your own research and have your own conclusion, but as somebody that previously supported wikileaks through donations, I no longer believe that they can be trusted either because of who they are cooperating with, being coerced by, or their hypocritical cries for transparency while being very secretive about their own choices for publishing information.  I want to be clear that I don't disagree with any of their releases as I believe fully in transparency, but it's clear there is a hidden agenda.

However, running a node was something I'd done two years ago and I had intended to do so again in the future, but I'm lazy.  The UASF resounded strongly with my personal view of how btc should move forward both conceptually and in terms of 'how' or rather the means by which that would occur.  Thanks to the devs and other supporters of BIP 148 for the opportunity.

Jesus you people are daft.  The leftists are fascists?  
KKK, Trump, Sessions, Hitler &lt;---Fascists
Words have definitions. Words have meaning.  You can't use a word as an insult for something you don't like and think it means something else.  I don't give two flying fucks if you don't like ANTIFA, but they are a leftist group.  By definition of the fucking word, they aren't fascist.  It's not some nuanced meaning of the word either, the ideas the group supports aren't fascist ideas. Regardless of how you feel about them they are not fascists. Read a fucking text book.
Just read your comments, typical t_d user.  How can a 26 year old be so narrow minded? So worried about identity politics and refugees that you'll support an actual traitor.  Whatever comrade, enjoy your burning dumpster fire of a country.

Yeah they both suck, but words have meaning and Trump is by definition a fascist and so are his supporters, they're literally trying to redefine the word by using it on a leftist group.  The definition so aptly describes the right wing nationalist trump party that again it's as if people don't understand what the word "fascist" means.
as to your other reply to my comments...I haven't shown support for either group, I'm just responding to the brainwashed-by-russian-propaganda youth from the_donald that are replying to my comment.  they get a comrade-boner every time antifa is mentioned because in their simple world they need a perceived enemy for their worldview and narrative to make sense.  Personally I think both groups are a bunch of twats.  Though there is no bigger twat than a meme-posting-trump-supporting, in-denial-about their casual rascism child that thinks their views are nuanced and people or "the left" (there's that enemy again!) just don't understand they are actually good people that aren't just selfish narrow minded cunts that **see a fallen apple and think about the tree, while forgetting about the orchard.**  That bolded section is well over the head of anybody that supports sessions and trump.
and yeah i read your profile, i see you're a trump supporter.  Your comments also displayed that you can string a thought together and so I'm not going to block you right away, most trumpettes aren't anything more than a reactionary goat, ramming their head into anything unfamiliar (such as thinking), hoping that if they bleat **LOUD ENOUGH** they'll win the discussion, because in their simple world there are only two results: winning and losing.  The world is so much more complex than that and therefore a few trump supporters might have enough wits to one day grow out of their views if they experience enough of the world with their blinders off.
