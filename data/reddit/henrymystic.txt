It is literally one of the points of money--why would it be valuable if infinite?

Although it isn't your preference, some people like the idea of a world-wide general use currency they own.

Bitcoin is a hive mind of "dur banks destroy value dur".
Some people in this thread really need an econ class to see you can't have capitalism work effectively with a deflationary currency.
Although I agree Bitcoin is the best long term solution, it isn't better because of less inflation. That is a [flaw]( not a feature.

Inflation isn't theft, it is a market force that encourages spending so money just doesn't sit around doing nothing. It is suppose to be for the most efficient use of *capital*. People hording Bitcoin just so that the price goes up isn't a great thing.

They've been accepting BTC for years now.

He specifically asked about bitcoins, I don't understand why you suggested that.

Oh totally. A [FDIC insured]( [VC-backed]( scam.

His point is the previous poster said:


But he has his keys, so they are his coins.

Actually the [Bitcoin wiki]( says bitcoin is compatible and will be used for and by modern banks.
Like it or not, it actually makes sense to use modern banks with bitcoin for the same reasons we use them with fiat. Lending is a huge and important part of the economy, and some users really don't want to worry about security. You can "be your own bank" with USD Cash but most let banks worry about keeping their money safe. This will almost assuredly continue.

I understand, and that is why we have fees.

Doesn't matter if it is saving or hoarding. The point of capitalism is the most efficient use of resources. Inflation encourages resource use. Deflation actively encourages saving and inactivity, and makes the real value of debt higher everyday. I feel like most of the people in this thread need to take a basic econ course because you can't have one without the other.
