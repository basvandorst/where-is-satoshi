There is no way you can compare them the scams like BFL, Cointerra, Hashfast and Bitmine. KnC delivered, on time and above spec. Remember the Jupiter originally was going to be 350Gh and ended up at 550GH for October and 650GH for November. Even now people can overclock their October Jupiters to 650GH and their November ones to over 900GH! Thats for machines that were delivered in October/November 2013 that have already ROI'ed.
Neptune isn't late, they have to end of June to still be on time, whether its worth it or not is up to the individual.
They *ARE* processing refunds if you want them, there are some vociferous people who may have had slow refunds, there are in any business, but most are getting them within a few weeks at most.
Of course there were some October Jupiters that performed poorly out of the box, and of course that has generated some angst and tantrums from people who "don't play well with others" and feel the need to vent. But this knee jerk reaction from what is probably KnC's competitors trolls more than anyone else is pathetic.
I feel sorry for the people who got impatient and went for the "Super Jupiter" option, from the start it seemed to me to be a bad idea, but I understand the motivation of "better to have 3TH now than 3-5TH in *whenever*" but it looked like a train wreck arriving into the platform from way out to me. (yeah yeah, hindsight etc)
But KnC a scam, hard to swallow for thousands of their satisfied customers.
