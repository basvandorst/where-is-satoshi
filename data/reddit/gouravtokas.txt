Not so good actually....... tired of waking up in morning and checking the price before even checking out the msgs or the news........only to find disappointment. Waiting desperately for the market to flip.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:31:41
this is such a revolting pic...... !
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:34:37
considering today's technology.
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:15:58
someone will still be working and earning btc in return. they will be taxed in btc.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:11:10
4 successive major declines? first time in bitcoin history.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:48:21

@_date: 2018-12-18 12:22:01

I'LL share the contact details of rehab for you, dont worry.
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:01:01
if they kill it, who will they sell 'it' to make money? defeats the whole purpose.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:11:10
Don't understand ur point mate
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:32:23
only if u cashout in non-dollar fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:51:53
This is really shitty, similar thing happened with me, even more embarrassing.
Went on a holiday, checking into resort on a island in different country, tried to pay via my debit/credit cards, payment refused. First the bank didn't knew the exact reason, later they said because you were exceeding day limits to that country.
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:57:44
I don't keep all my cards's limit for all countries handy, sorry, my fault?
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:11:55
hmmmm....... Naaaaaa..... .!
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:16:21
Nothing is final guys, this is one of those things which will drag on for years due to elections, inter-agency fight and finally lack of clarity and implementation. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:55:24
You know wat?...... You gotta get there first.....!
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:31:33
make it green.........
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:54:26

@_date: 2018-12-09 11:05:47
i do have some of it on exchanges to withdraw, and i like the idea. make it more popular.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:23:35
So which half are you?
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:00:47
They will take your 30% of crypto holdings
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:54:42
Agree with u, but they could've come up with a better solution, they had a lot of time, but instead they embarrassed us. They had their chance, to hell with 'em.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:30:47
gandalf is a liar.... !
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:21:23
doesn't make difference
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:22:19
DIE.....! die....MF .....die....!!
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:25:21
Exactly my point, that how come there is nothing to talk about. NO news, nothing.
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:54:35
DON'T WAIT FOR 3RD.
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:27:47
i don't see a single miner, its some sort of network hub, not mining pool.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:38:05
doesn't mean much, correlation period is too short. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:50:17
bust that fud
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:51:24
stupid move imo. One can always make more btc addresses. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:36:51
TAX FREE CRYPTO? no such thing brother.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:11:57
Why go to that much trouble? 
JUST ban bitcoin in USA, news itself will drive the price go to near zero, buy on the way  down to let's say 100$btc, own a lot of it. 
Put random sanctions on countries promoting/using bitcoin and you are golden.
@_date: 2018-12-04 06:16:54
age old tactics, badmouth it bcuz ur late to the party, so that they can buy it on the side.
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:20:55
It is amazing, at the time of writing, 6800 people online and 21 comments in 7 hours.  
Just amazing.
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:14:13
could be an artificial intelligence skimming of everybody's gains in a systematic way to takeover the world in near future.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:33:15
because its the only asset they can manipulate to make s and not get into trouble.....
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:32:35
Seriously, Who gives a fuck about coinbase anyway?
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:16:49
I know, that's why I said, news will make price to tank, ppl will still use it for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:18:51
good for them.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:13:53
Yes and yes
