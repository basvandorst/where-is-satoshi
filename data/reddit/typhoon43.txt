Was moving away from CB so no funds in my account. Used my Credit Card which meant I had to use CB instead of GDAX.

I will never forget. I somehow ended up with .19 BCH so I renamed the wallet to "Roger's Whore Fund". The problem is that I signed up for a Gemini account 10 days ago and they're still verifying my account, so I had to throw more money at CB for some BTC today  and paid out the nose in fees just to get it to another Exchange to buy Alts. I felt dirty.

I can't retire until 2040 so I'm just gonna see if it's still a thing then. Going deep.

This is the holiday news I wanted to see. I really hope it comes to fruition. We need some major players like Amazon to adopt BTC. I hope it helps drive the progress of getting segwit/LN integrated faster.

I believe in cryptocurrency and BTC carries the public torch for all coins in my mind. If it hits 20k I'll be selling enough to simply pay off my total investment. No taxes since I break even on my original buy amount and I hold/use the rest of my coins until I reach my retirement age. I want this to be something for the World, and I want to say I was a part of it.

So HODL is 4 years ODL now? How time flies.

Easily. Welcome to blockchain.

Don't throw me in that "American" pot. I bleed Red, White, and Blue, but I'm holding because I believe in BTC. Today's recap should just be "more people sold than bought".

This is how things work. You pay taxes when you sell something for profit. It's always been this way, but it seems a ton of people on this sub think the government won't ask for them. This is an exchange, just like the stick market. You pay your dues. Sheesh.

If I something bad happens and I actually need the funds, or when I retire; whichever comes first. I invested into BTC as a retirement option, and other coins to use as currency.

But the same token, if you have your BTC on a Ledger Nano and the coin shows up, can't you deposit to gdax and then cash it out right then? Will Coinbase somehow have the forked coins before a Ledger user?

Chuck motherfucking Norris

Wait... You can sell Bitcoin? Well screw me sideways and call me Sally! Why the hell have I been holding for so long?

But will we hit a million dollars when the sub only has 20,000 hodlers? That is the true question.
