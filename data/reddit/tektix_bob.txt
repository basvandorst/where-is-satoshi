Freedom starts where money (no matter which form it takes) ends! We (the users as well as the abused ones of money) do not have any idea what freedom might be... because all our (personal) liberties are directly connected to money. So, for freedom it will take a little bit more than crypto ;-)

Besides the video, which appears too common about global payment for me, not pointing out the real advantage of this great service and the gap it fills... services like these are a keen way to go down the path of money and a necessity for European circumstances.
I used to test around a little bit with such services and I may recommend also  which is slightly more expensive than bitwa.la but got my attention way earlier and actually is redesigning the whole project for good reasons deriving from:
The gap - But what is the actual gap that's filled?
Spoken very commonly|subjectively in Europe by far not everybody is using|holding a credit/debit card. This means that most money transactions in B2C business on regular+irregular basis are still done by simple money transfers on the SEPA System (from bank account to bank account) which lasted between 2 - 5 days depending on the willingness/ruthless of the banks. The disadvantages for the account holder|customer can clearly be seen and those services I've tested so far (found by simple google search + doing basic scam checking) are doing a great job and have good customer care (got|might get important in cases of network stress tests etc.).
The bridge - how are these services set up?
Mostly will be found 3 instances in this process (where of course each one wants to earn money):
- the one, who offeres the service itself by providing a website/app/api
- the cryptocurrency/money-exchange
- the bank that actually does the transactions
The results -  Relatively high overall transaction costs
Around 0,5% to EUR 1,- and +1% in fees, not mentioning that the used exchange is about 3% abroad actual kraken/btc-e/... ratings, where providers have/had the opportunity to get an exchange by themselves resulting in lower averall transaction costs and not harming several banking laws. 
The dead end - how these services react to the ever existing gap between fiat money and cryptocurrencies.
In short: not at all.
In long: they build some old-fashioned centralized B2C business platform with login&amp;password (far away from BitID+LedgerWallet-pairings or even 2FA) where every user from now on has a name and he/she is is fully trackable... &lt;sarcasm&gt;How enlighting it is to see the possibilities of cryptocurrencies and building out a pioneering service by shrinking it down to the functionality of a bank!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Obviously I want to express that might not be the way I would recommend to anyone working in this fintech area... 
My advise:"Get the f**k out of your centralized way of thinking and build a service that fully benefits its users but also lets the provider make a fair+transparent cut, anonymously/pseudonymously!"
To be conducted...
