I've use Bitnik Reload regularly with my [BitGo]( wallet and it works great. Never thought to connecting all to Cashila - but it is seems like a really great idea! :)
Regarding the anonimity - Reload does not hold on to you bitcoins, everything works via the API and you only need an email address. The same goes with Cashila.

So long, and thanks for all the Bitcoins.

Based on their FAQ, they currently offer wire transfer in the EU, so Azerbeijan is not supported.
But still.. I've used them a couple of times. Great service. The fee is only 1%, and the money is transferred the next business day.

Huobi below Bitstamp. Haven't seen that for quite some time..

Too bad i didnt buy the lottery ticket a couple of years ago, when they ware cheaper..
@_date: 2016-01-04 20:42:25
Yay! Happy bitcoin day!
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:42:45
They are ok, did some transfers and all went through..
You should also check Cashila  they offer the same service, are licensed, and you get a better price for your bitcoins. Cashila is my first choice.

Well it depends where you are from. There are many services that allow you to send you bitcoin to bank account
Cashila.com  - Europe
Bylls.com  - Canada
LROS  - Australia
@_date: 2016-01-08 13:51:42
Tip  If you are from Europe or paying to Europe, you can check Cashila. Works like a charm ;)
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:59:10
Yeah, been using Cashila for quite some time. Really great service!
Now it's time to try it with Mycelium Wallet :D
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:45:38
Now that is something! Still the price seems a bit high..
I'd be better off making a standard bank withdrawal and buy the gold straight from Moro, since l'm Slovenian :)
@_date: 2016-01-11 10:04:47
Would recommend Cashila. Great service!
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:26:19
Tried them both. Bitwala indeed has lower fees, but on Cashila you get a better price for your bitcoin. They also seem more transparent. 
I'm sticking with Cashila. Great service.
@_date: 2016-01-01 08:37:02
Happy new year! :)

Check r/bitcoinmarkets for trading tips.
You could use leverage on some of the exchanges, tho.
@_date: 2016-01-03 00:34:11
You can try with Cashila.com.
Just convert your bitcoins to EUR and send them to your local bank in the UK. Simple.
@_date: 2016-01-03 00:45:54
Not sure what you are looking for, but if you just want to buy stuff with bitcoin, there are many services..
I use Cashila.com to transfer my bitcoins to any merchant accepting wire transfers as payment.
@_date: 2016-02-04 09:43:04
Yeah, I meant for paying bills.. Used them both, and both offer great services.
Still, you could also use debit cards like [mywirecard]( and top them up with Cashila.

Love the work everyone is putting into the development of the bitcoin ecosystem. Great job!
Lots of startups are emerging. [Cashila]( is also a safe bet when dealing with day-to-day payments.
@_date: 2016-02-21 10:40:56
Yeah, would recommend Cashila ( Definitely one of the simplest way to pay any kind of bill here in Europe straight with bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2016-02-04 14:18:53
Not on my script.. 1.1231
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:47:31
I'm also in Europe, but I use Cashila ( 
I like the convenience of getting paid for my work directly to my Cashila account and cash out the euros for bitcoins whenever I need them :)
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:04:43
Until it's true
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:35:53
I'm quite happy with [preev](
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:18:08
Would love to see it!
