I don't really think the risk is in the code. I'm just a bit unsure how a hard fork (no matter what the underlying reason is!) would work out. We're not dealing with a "one branch of the fork is good, one branch of the fork is bad" situation which might arise due to some (fixed) bug.
We're dealing with "MegaCoin" vs. "SmallCoin" here. What if Coinbase decides to stick with the current protocol, while BitPay wants the new version to suceed? What does that do to the exchange rates of both variants? What if all exchanges trade both variants?
I'd love to see some point in time, soon, where the miners start to indicate their interest in the new blocks (adding version=4?). And I'd like to see, at the _same_ time, that big players like Coinbase, BitPay, Circle, Kraken, and MtGox (just kidding) also clearly state that they will not accept/deal/trade/... the old variant - which sadly still exists even if there is a hard fork!
Then, after both the miners and hopefully also the big players decided on the new variant and all users had enough time to update their clients, the fork can actually happen. Then, I imagine, the "old" branch of the fork will be tiny and the coins traded there would be close to worthless.

Multisig. Make it easy to create multisig wallets, and distribute the secrets. Of course, all of this should be safe in every possible meaning of the word.
As a use case, I want to have a wallet that is easy to use for all the usual Bitcoin transactions (receiving, sending, requesting). In addition to that, I want to be able to create multisig wallets so that a trusted person without being a computer literate ("mom") can help me to sign important transactions from this "savings" account.
Armory is a good start, but too complicated.

* Gavin's proposal: 
* A long-ish post basically saying "Yes": 
* More: 
* A reddit discussion started by someone saying "No": 
Please suggest more links giving useful information. Is there something explaining the "No" side?
EDIT: Not even mentioning upvotes anymore. Except for this EDIT entry.

...so it is "at least OK"?

I'm not really worried about this part. The miners (or pools) decide, and after a while it is settled - or not. But what happens as soon as there is the first big block? Are there clients, miners, merchants, exchanges that still run the old chain (which still grows, if there is a miner left)? If so, how many? What happens with the "duplicated" Bitcoins, what influence does that have on the price(s)?
I'm pretty sure nothing must go wrong on the first try. Bitcoin is too big to deal with technical issues. There are other issues now.

I'm a user. A clever one maybe, but just a regular user. I don't even mine.

Oh. Hi! One of the "Yes" voters, I assume? :)
EDIT: I remember you suggested a rough time frame, involving blocks of version 4. I can't find it, do you know what I mean?
EDIT2: Nevermind. I already posted the link, did not read properly.

I agree, but I also think there is no clear answer. No one knows how exactly two blockchains (one with the current protocol, one starting with the first larger block) would go side by side. No one knows what the future brings.
I prefer to answer questions, and collect different opinions. Miners are the ones who decide, and I'd love to hear some opinions (or concerns) of actual miners.

I like your spirit.
