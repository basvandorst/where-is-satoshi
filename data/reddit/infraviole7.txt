Now I'm not sure about that: yes, the Swedish government would probably take side with the US, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can take down the servers, if SR would use the same law troll as TPB: their servers are officially (that meaning that they actually aren't in real life) located behind the Swedish Pirate Party's servers. By doing that, they are legally defended from a shutdown, since it is a crime against freedom of speech in Sweden to shut down a political party's server. If SR would do this, then yes, the government  could not shut down the site. Although in my personal belief, I don't think that the SPP would protect such a site, since it would lead to bad reputation for the party. But who knows, of all the swedish parties, they're the ones which surprises the most.
Source for facts: TPB AFK and also the fact that I'm a Swede.

I have now started a subreddit, [ArtistsGoneBitcoin]( to make it possible for people (me included) to earn money on our artistic skills. What do you think? :)

Wow bro, thanks!
My address is:
Have a nice day!
Edit: took me some time to figure out the bot thing... sorry for the missunderstanding!
Seriously, you gave me a free meal at a restaurant just like that...

 What's sad though is that juveniles as I need to buy our BTC:s from "dealers", who can buy them from Mt.Gox etc, since we can't make orders at Mt.Gox ourselves. This means that these "dealers" will make money of us for the work they've done. Really sad...

Really cool stuff! I am considering buying the 25 Gh/s miner from  BFL together with a Pi, and I'm wondering:
* **1** I guess you're running rasperian? This is the OS I've been seeing people running for their Pi miners so that's my ground for my guess.
* **2** Drivers, how do you install them for the Pi? Are these to be found at BFL's Webpage?
Thanks in advance!

Well not in my country. Congrats, 'Murica!

True! Got any tips? 
I've been thinking about making my adult brother my dealer (cuz he wont charge me), and then I'll buy as many BTC:s as I can get from ~150 dollars. Good idea?
