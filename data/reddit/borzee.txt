You’re saying you have to be stupid to want to work there?
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:32:23
Same: I keep thinking of taking all my money out of bitcoin and into alt coins.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:35:54
Love this response. Makes sense. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:53:20
Is it possible to change with consensus? I don’t get why everyone is being like oh it will never change, like as if the whole world is so against there being more coins. Why would people be so stubborn about stating at 21 million coins?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:35:12
Will other countries follow is the question
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:39:39
Can someone confirm this?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:08:25
The thing is. He isn’t moving 400M but BTC. The value assigned to the amount is 400M. Amazing.

With lightning network, realistically what would fees look like to transact or move $1000? $1,000,000? $100,000,000?
With lightning network, what would the transfer times be for all those transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:38:46
Where do you keep your wallet 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:42:16
How can they afford to do this?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:10
So if I want to work at Apple as an iOS developer or Google as a Product Manager, C?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:34:26
So how are you contributing something useful to the ecosystem and letting others stand on your shoulder...? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:12:46
Just curious as to all the languages out there, why C++. If there was a specific benefit or reason... I guess not!
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:44:39
Already have 70% btc and rest alt (including LTC). I’ve just done a lot of the math and it seems the profits to be made for however long these alts run is more to be reaped.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:47:57
Any empirical Comparison ?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:36:45
Is this true?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:35:48
What a fucking idiot 
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:39:20
If this is true.... ❤️❤️
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:17:34
I thought this too!
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:04:13
This was a very good response thank you 
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:50:40
Literally me... when bitcoin is up I’m all ecstatic but when it’s down I catch myself losing hope. I guess it’s human, but with enough of these dips my thinking has changed. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:26:50
How do you decipher someone’s ability from looking at their code?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:38:42
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:51:40
What would it take to get consensus to increase total capacity from 21M to more for BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:23:23
Would there be a better language to code bitcoin in assuming you’re an expert in every language?
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:15:58
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:29:13
Very interesting. What’s the likelihood of this happening and by when you think?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:27:24
How many operations would it be using a quantum computer?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:11:03
Cool :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:11:23
What? What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:28:22
What system do you use to plan your buys
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:20:33
Why do you say that?
What books do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:39:13
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:47:40
So, sorry newbie question: will the lightning network implementation significantly reduce fees?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:27:31
And here we are, so deep in the cult it’s hard to see where the tunnel started!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:24:17
Tiny fees will probably lead to greater adoption by masses for transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:23:12
How is it the second largest market cap crypto currency right now? And are you saying it’ll be dumped and crash down soon?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:44:31
Very important point thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:26:35
How did you get that number? Do you have a background in math?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:25:56
Never thought of that. Good point. Bank accounts could be broken into. Passwords guesses for accounts, etc. Right?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:09:24
So you won’t sell even if the price went down to $2000 next month? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:25:32
How is it centralized ? I read the white paper and it seems like instead of going through every node it uses a select few... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:26:05
Hahahahaahahahahaahahaha 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:27:01
So you plan to never, ever sell ? Unless it’s at “the Moon”
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:40:22
Surprised at how low the price is for that lambo.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:27:58
FYI- not promoting that Bitcoin is a bubble. Just found this article interesting.
Can someone confirm that maximum number of transactions on the Blockchain is 10 per second? Source? Can this be changed in the future?
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:14:01
My microeconomics professor said this to me
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:13:28
Do you know the answer to the question? If you do, why don’t you share? If you don’t, why are you telling me to inform myself? 
Jesus it must be hard for you to come off your high horse and just give a simple answer to people. I’m sharing an article that people might find interesting and throwing a comment in it too. People like you really push new comers away from this site 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:09:28
How is that trolling? I️ suggest you fuck off.
Leave a constructive comment or don’t comment at all you useless waste of space. The Reddit community isn’t made for the discussion of experts. No such thing as a stupid question. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:53:26
Twitter is not bad. I’m in a few Facebook groups. You really don’t need that many sources tho. Anything major will appear on one of them! Also, WhatsApp group with friends. PM me if you wanted to be added.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:24:40
Can the main chain ever be altered? Who can do that ?
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:10:04
Because it’s decentralized by nature, it needs no entity to government it. Also, I think it’s fair to say it’s gaining more stability.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:25:00
Dude, love your responses. I want to be friends with you!
If you are in a minority chain, is it possible to transfer your $ to a majority chain?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:09:23
How can I save this to my iPhone?
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:59:58
Is this feasible? Like can it actually be done ? How could it or who has the authority to do this ? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:20:26
How can I save this gif to my phone ??
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:06:07
Amazing. Where did you first learn all this? Researching on your own?
Also, is the main chain decided by amount of transactions within that chain?
Does the capability of chains affect and make BitCoin vulnerable to a major crash in the future?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:49:19
What...? How can you ignore total number of coins increasing? It would affect the value. Who controls the forks?
