Well, I made one. :)  - I included a bot to get realtime quote for BTC, BCH and ETH.

It's 1.49$ CAD to buy let say 25$. (About 6%) But it's 15$ CAD to transfer from Coinbase to Bitfinex. They also trade the Bitcoin at 6 290$ compare to 6 225$ on Bitfinex. (1% higher)
In short: a 25$ CAD trade will get hit with 67% fees before it can get to my Bitfinex wallet. :) I guess under 250$ or 500$ it doesn't worth it.

1. Create yourself a Coinbase ( Gdax ( and Nicehash ( account.
2. In your AMD panel, change the card optimisation setting from Graphic to Compute.
3. Install Nicehash Legacy and benchmark your CPU with Monero (XMR) and your GPU with EquiashDecreed. This will enable you for triple mining your card with Monero, Ethereum and Decreed at the same time.
4. Start mining. Nicehash will convert all your mining into one bitcoin payment. You can install a mobile app to follow it in realtime.
5. When you have enough money, transfer the balance from nicehash to Coinbase. (0$ fees) Then transfer from Coinbase to Gdax (0$ fees). From there you can keep your investment, trade it for other coin (Litecoin, Ethereum) or send it to another exchange.
6. This is my setup, using RX 570. I made a dashboard to monitor my mining payout. 
7. Mining is incredibly fun and the community is awesome. Join the discord and chat with the developers of the various coin. i added mining as a mechanics in the game I am creating (Military hacking RPG), it's pretty fun!
