Segwit is a con for a lot of people, everything segwit does would have been accomplished better and in a more understandable way if it were done as a hard fork.

My understanding is that you'll have to broadcast another transaction to refill it, so paying 5 USD to keep 100 USD in your hot wallet is kinda feels bad.


The big difference between a LN node and the rest of the internet is that if you keep the LN node off line until the channel lock time expires you can steal all of the money in the channel.


Routing isn't a hard problem when you first think about it. It becomes significantly more complicated when you know that to efficiently route a tx you need to understand the entire LN networks state. You need to know every other node on the network as well as every node they're connected to in order to efficiently route a transaction. You also need to know weather or not they'll charge a fee and be able to route around them if the're not responsive.
This isn't an issue for a few thousand nodes but when you start getting to the hundreds of thousands and millions of nodes it starts to be come computationally difficult. It's at this point that it becomes much more centralized because to cheapen the computational cost you can easily disregard all the nodes with less than 1000 connections and suddenly you only connect through major LN hubs.

As I recall Iota has an issue where it needs a node that designs the tangle. That code is also closed source. It's an interesting concept but  until they solve that issue Iota is what ever.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:54:51
The coordinator for the tangle isn't open source, and without the coordinator the tangle doesn't function.
At this point the appeal of Bitcoin is purely speculative. If lightning works out and that is a big if then bitcoin can scale reasonably well. While Lightning isn't a panacea for all of Bitcoin's problems it does represent a big increase in the viability of bitcoin and trust-less networks in general.
EDIT: I shouldn't have said purely speculative. Bitcoin does have the inherent value of its network. But most of bitcoin's value is speculative.

Bitcoin is a permissionless ledger, who gets to decide what fee level and transaction priority levels gets labeled as spam?
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:51:00


I'm confused you assert this and provide no reasoning. Are you saying that because clusters of nodes are inside the same data center they break the security model?
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:12:41
It depends when the fork snapshots the block chain. Segwit transactions are any one can spend transactions so the fork would need to handle those transactions in some way otherwise they'll be able to all be swept into 1 wallet by the person who mines the first block on the chain.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:39:44
90,400 tx's for the transaction fee to be 1 sat with an average transaction size of 226b. But comparing like that is kind of a a strawman.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:00:39
It's nothing like that. Bitcoin has a finite space for transactions, emails don't. If people want to artificially inflate the tx fees it's their business. Bitcoin is a permissionless ledger they don't need your permission to do what ever they want with it. If all it takes is a couple hundred BTC to push a 250 bn market cap coin around then bitcoin wont survive.

LN has some comparative disadvantages and problems that aren't even close to being solves. Personally my biggest issue is that I have to have my signing device online to be able to use the LN instead of keeping my private keys offline.
LN nodes need to be online at all times with the ability to sign transactions online. So your private key has to be on a machine that has access to the internet.
Since you're online you're also vulnerable to things like DDOS attacks and what ever else an always online machine is vulnerable to.
LN routing isn't even close to being solved and I don't see how it could be done in a method that isn't hub+spoke which is centralized.
Diverting fees away from miners challenges the game theory assumptions that BTC was built on, but this isn't something I consider an issue.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:31:26


That's not the same as 54% of all bitcoin cash nodes. Bitcoin ABC represents 81% of the current bitcoin cash nodes.  
This is the part where I ask you why 0 conf makes it totally broken where any one can do anything.
Also when nodes disagree that's how you get a fork that's where bitcoin cash came from, nodes disagreeing.

He's being sarcastic. There cant be a mechanism to determine which transactions are spam because that destroys the fungability of bitcoin.

Segwit is already active and it allows for the ln which reduces the volume of on chain transactions. Miners could essentially boycott ln channel opening/closing or segwit tx's but another miner could just come along and collect the money from those transactions. Competition is what keeps miners honest and ensures them working towards the betterment of the network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:56:03
Wtf, that's fucking evil.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:42:40
I'd recommend you wait for the tx fees to drop and move them, it'll probably save you money in the long term. You could also just make a low tx fee tx now and wait for it to confirm.

Yes, there really is no excuse to not having a consensus mechanism for the block size. All the rhetoric that modest block size increases increase centralization is bullshit.
That being said block size isn't the long term solution. A second layer is required in some form to be able to scale to a global currency.

Witness data isn't stored on the block chain.


That's fine, but just because the majority are doesn't have any bearing on this one.


Bitcoin is open source, who the developers are doesn't matter as much as what they produce, and I prefer the product that BU produces to core.


If you think that then I think you've been drinking too much of the Kool Aid, and should try consuming news from more than one persons viewpoint.

Why is segwit a better solution than BU, in your own words?
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:23:43
Because storing transactions in a separate chain is a very hacky solution, and I don't think such a hack has any place in bitcoin. I also don't think that protocol changes should be deployed as a softfork anyways. Also in my eyes BU comes across as a more trustworthy team of developers than core, but that probably has more to do with core devs constantly shooting their public appearance in the foot.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:55:57

BTC hit it's ATH after BCC forked, I'm not an experienced trader but I don't think that's the intended effect of a short. Also you don't have to become the main bitcoin to be successful.
The whole fork is an ideological one where they see the network progressing another direction, and when viewed from that direction it was a screaming success. They forked and both chains are doing exceedingly well currently.
To be honest your reply requires some serious mental gymnastics to be even be slightly realistic. You can't assume some one is a fucking moron and at the same time able to create these grand schemes where they're manipulating people towards the end of leaving them holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:22:45
On average blocks have been mined once every ~20 mins for the last 59 blocks. So to say that it takes on average 3 hours to get 2 confirmations is anecdotal.
 The real issue with BCC in my personal opinion is that to spend it I would have to do BCC-&gt;BTC-&gt;service, which is the same issue every other altcoin has.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:29:52
To sell their coins they have to wait, but they can start mining them when ever. also 100 blocks is on average going to be less than 24 hours for BTC and a under 36 hours for BCC. 100 Blocks isn't a long time. I'm not sure how this effects pool mining though.

It always confuses me how people think it will go if s2x does have over 85% of the hash power. Block times will slow to over 1 hour per block on average and and with there being 2016 blocks between difficulty adjustments it'll be on average over a month for blocks to start coming in at a reasonable speed again.
