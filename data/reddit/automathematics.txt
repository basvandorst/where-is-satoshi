I would say to take your time making a a site that bitcoin needs, not a copy of a site that already supports BTC. But if this is your passion, good luck with it!

I know this is something easy to say once you're part of the bitcoin ecosystem, but if you're NOT and this was the day you decided to join the movement... how would you use bitcoin to order the coin? "Pay via coinbase" will lead you to a "I'm sorry, your account isn't verified" etc etc. The barrier of entry is still too high.
I hope circle and companies like that help fill this gap and bring bitcoin to the average user. If it were as easy as using paypal, people wouldn't have used paypal in the first place :/

I got a weird message on Circle on Android and reported it to them just in case something funny was going on and they never even replied to my support ticket.
Moved my money out ASAP. 
(also the transfer that I did to remove the money, their email confirmation didn't come through for ~4 days even though the money was gone within an hour)

Phones will never work because they might be used by terrorists.
Winter Ski masks will never work because they might be used by terrorists
Pants will never work because they might be used (worn) by terrorists.

... you will see that it's still sitting there, right where you left it?

"Real Currency". Bummer.
Maybe I'll reconsider my password manager to one that does stay modern with technology...

The problem here is that if Bitcoin users love Uber, then this promo is pointless since we already have Uber accounts, no?

You're a good person. &lt;3
