Uhh, stable price?
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:06:24
Its been getting better even if you look at u6
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:08:32
and thats a good thing to have such instablity?

How was this not the first response to his question?
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:12:05
Exchanges seem to be hacked alot.  That is a problem.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:15:11
A claim without any proof.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:24:41
I would point out that there is no reason to suspect that the underlying cost will equal the eventual price of btc.
For instance, a penny costs more than a penny to make.  But its still a penny.

Your last sentence only holds if us economic growth rate isn't sufficient.  Its not foregone conclusion.

According to the two chairmen at the hearing today, they would agree with my statement.

You don't understand.
If you invest 1k in something and it goes down, and your logic is that you dont want to sell because you put 1k in, that my friend is a sunk cost fallacy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:02:46
Remind me! 1 day
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:33:16
per a psychic vision?  What kind of justification is that?
there are good reasons to be a proponent of virtual currency.  This is not one of them.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:09:57
the hearing begins at 10.  i know because ill be in the room
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:15:30
your argument still doesn't work.   
But sure, argue with the economist.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:38:02
The Federal Reserve has only existed since 1913.  So, a century and a few years.
And its not a family...
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:35:31
gold is less volatile and has uses beyond a medium of exchange.  the two are not comparable.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:40:50
There are flaws with digital currency.  There is the challenge of a potential 51% attack.  Then you have exchanges that abscond with people's digital currency.  Then ICOs that also turn into fakes.
Distributed ledger technology will, eventually, be a part of the financial mainstream.  But which coin, and how?  anyone's guess
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:50:33
Never said I was invested in gold.  and gold is used in more than just plugs.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:31:58
This is bad investing.  You are committing a sunk cost fallacy.
You either hold because your expectations are that it will be profitable, or you sell because they are not.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:11:04
pardon me if I express extreme skepticism that psychic powers exist at all.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:16:47
just as there were with the real estate universities teach people to flip homes because prices always go up.
this is the same thing, except you cant live in $1,000 BtC but you can still live in a house your paid too much for.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:05:38
Visa payment processing is much faster.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:30:18
no the two are uncorrelated.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:27:11
definitions vary.  So in Africa because of lack of infrastructure, payment processing through your mobile phone is very popular and they have been ahead of the tech curve in that market in recent years.
So they might be counted as unbanked, but that just means a lack of attachment a bank, not attached into the financial market itself.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:43:40
gold is used in physical production of many items.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:41:57
its much less than 1% of world pop.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:44:48
think of cryptos as stocks that are highly correlated with each other.
So like, if there was an oil spill, not only does Exxon stock go down but other oil companies also do because future expectations for the industry shift.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:14:32
sunk cost fallacy.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:04:35
Yep, us financial economists who actually study mediums of exchange  know nothing, nothing at all.
I am incredibly interested in distributed ledger tech, but that threatens payment processors, not banks, and because at least in SEC, CFTC have found virtual currency is a commodity, they can regulate it.  And because of anti-money-laundering rules in US, virtual currencies will be under intense scrutiny.
But again, I am sure you know more.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:30:12
distributed ledger technology will be used in financial systems, for certain, in the future.
what coins survive is speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:31:44
Oh this again.
The economy is quite a bit like the weather.  We've improved our short term forecasting ability, but in the long-term there are many moving parts.  
Further, many economists began warning about precursors to the financial crisis as early as 2004.   
And Equifax?  last time I checked that was a cyber security breach, and I am fairly certain economists are not cyber security experts nor should they be.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:21:58
No, they are not. I work as a fin regulator.  This is not a primary or secondary concern of banks.  
Payment processors are more dialed in (Visa).
Btw, US Senate is holding a hearing on crypto currency next Tuesday.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:53:26

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:01
You could read the prepared testimony by SEC and CFTC head to get a sense.
I can tell you that its probably not good for BtC.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:45:50
many would say that is bad, on here.
in terms of the underlying technology being adopted, i would say that is a good.
But there are serious AML (money launder) issues with crypto as far as governments are concerned.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:23:56
I suspect the increased attention governments are paying to it (hearings in US next week, South Korea clamping down) and some recent issues with other ICOs turning into scams, explains the decline.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:59:59
my point was to produce a simple example that the cost to produce something is not a natural floor for price.  I could introduce JHBucks that cost 50k to produce but if no one wants them the price is 0
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:44:53
This line of questioning by Cortez Masto is one any crypto asset must address in order for broad adoption
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:07:07
africa has a robust mobile payments system.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:18:19
This is bad logic.
a) 40% of BTC is held by a few hundred individuals.  They know each other.  Its perfectly reasonable to assume they can communicate and collude especially given low volume.
b) You assume scarcity by itself raises price. 
c) BTC is infinitely divisible.  
d) You assume runs are inevitable.  They are not.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:50:52
the crash in the US stock market has nothing to do with what is crashing BtC.  Stock market is pricing in more interest rate hikes due to greater potential for inflation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:38:20
sunk cost fallacy.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:43:53
i dont really see how that is a justifiable assumption
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:00:53
Congress has oversight on agencies and so uses oversight to bring in those who run those agencies.
They can compel agency heads to come testify.  They cannot compel those who are not heads of agencies.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:44:00
no they are not.

@_date: 2018-02-04 19:24:44
I'm actually going to be at that hearing.
Questions senators ask will give folks an idea about regulatory concerns.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:11:05
No, the SEC doesn't
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:42:52
opening up futures also means SEC and CFTC will have even more interest.

Why are you investing with money you need to living expenses?
