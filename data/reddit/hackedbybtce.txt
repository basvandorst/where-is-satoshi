Sign up for an account with IAFCU.  Today.
They will support you in Colorado, they support me in Los Angeles.  Consider a second bank account at another institution for larger savings, just in case.
BTW: Amagi Metals is an important supporter of bitcoin.  We need you to continue your terrific business.

Still have yet to reach the btc-e admin.  When I found the vircurex site was down I changed my password.  This change likely led to my current problem.  My btc-e account has all of my funds in a "payment warrant".  My account required email confirmation to send send funds, but this did not occur.

You are correct.  I was hacked.  This post was to let the community know.  I think that the accounts on vircurex are not safe. I have yet to hear from btc-e.

NihilistAU- thank you for listening.  I am concerned.  Bitparking is going offline and stating PPC will be transferred to vircurex.  I have tried multiple ways to reach BTC-e, no available.  Please, safely store your coins today on all sites. Curiously, the funds were removed from my btc-e account while I was watching and I could not prevent it.  Everything is listed as a payment warrant.  Fingers crossed.

Angry enough?  I am a big fan of bitcoin and encourage everybody to continue to utilize to the fullest.  My post is directed to those people who have accounts on vircurex and btc-e. My mtgox and bitparking accounts are fine.  If 20 other people reply with similar experiences then this problems is bigger than just mine.  And yes I signed up just to tell you.

My email was previously confirmed and I required an email prior to fund withdrawal.  Obviously those security measures were changed.  For some reason I can now not post in the chat room to report my loss.  Fishy.
