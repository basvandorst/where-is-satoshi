We definitely cannot all agree on that.  They have proved themselves incompetent and aren't qualified to operate at the level they have been.  They need to die and allow a better-qualified organization to replace them.   
  
There is no reason to believe this will not happen again if they are bailed out by user funds.  The writing was on the wall with the pre-halving outage and how that was handled.   If they are insolvent, they need to enter bankruptcy.  If not, they need to make their creditors whole.   
  


  
Yeah, only problem is, they ARE raiding lockers that weren't robbed.  But they are arbitrarily picking some lockers to break into and redistribute the contents while leaving others alone.

I'm all for them getting wiped off the board but that doesn't really have anything to do with the point being discussed.  Past profits are no longer assets of the company provided they have been paid out to stakeholders.  You are asking how much individuals will use of their personal income, income which is shielded from any liability the LLC has, to make creditors whole.    
  
The answer is *none* and the creditors have no legal claim on any of those funds.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:02:38
You are falling for the carefully worded nature of their boilerplate.  Notice they only say that 'the funds are safe', not that you'll get them back.  Any questions about their solvency or the obvious reality that they will enter bankruptcy and have their assets liquidated by the courts just gets met with the canned boilerplate.  
  
It's really cruel of them to be so disingenuous.
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:08:29


  
But they are doing the opposite.  They are claiming that all funds were in individual safe deposit boxes and at the same time saying only a certain subset of the non-robbed boxes (those with btc or USD) will have their contents confiscated and distributed to help compensate the hacked accounts.  
   
Why would some safe deposit boxes be eligible for redistribution but not others?

If I were the owner of some of the larger amounts of stolen BTC on bitfinex right now I'd be contacting legal representation in Hong Kong to get an immediate injunction with the aim of forcing them into bankruptcy, as it looks like their official line is 'tough titties, it's our fault but go fuck yourself, sorry not sorry'.

@_date: 2016-08-06 17:12:01
Ideally.   But there will likely be a massive run as everyone gets out what they can before the lawsuits hit and force it closed anyway.  If withdrawals are actually ever turned on (which I have my doubts will actually happen), anyone who leaves their funds in there deserves what they get.  They are inevitably going to be forced into bankruptcy as a result of litigation no matter what happens unless they can make their creditors whole very soon.

Very true.  Whether standard fiduciary responsibilities would even apply in any given jurisdiction is an unsettled question.

Which really excites me regarding the potential growth of Bitcoin.  That number leaves upwards of 4.5 billion plus people who can't even access bitcoin yet.

But you can't.  Not even the top fund managers can consistently pick the tops and bottoms.  No one knows what the market will do.  
  


  
Who said anything about not investing what you can afford?  If you want to own an asset, DCA is a good way to acquire it that mitigates risk.  Nothing precludes you from investing in multiple assets.  Whatever percentage of your income you can afford to invest you should invest.  Since no one has perfect knowledge of the market, DCA is a great way to get into assets.  It is a decidedly better strategy, on average, then putting all your eggs into one basket and making single huge bets.  DCA is a particularly well-suited strategy for high-volatility assets, less so with more stable assets.  Bitcoin is volatile and how.  
  


You are treating investment beliefs like they are infallible.  A prudent investor accounts for the possibility that his beliefs are wrong.  DCA effectively leads to more shares being purchased when their price is low and fewer when they are expensive. As a result, it can lower the total average cost per share of the investment, giving the investor a lower overall cost for the shares purchased over time.  This is a simple mathematical fact.  Trying to time the market is a suckers game.  It is far better to continuously invest a portion of income as it is earned. 
  


  
It matters to your bottom line and your cost basis absolutely should effect whether you hold an asset or not.  If you are up, on average, then it would be a better idea for you to sell than it would for someone whose basis is greater, so that you may lock in profits.  Again, all of this given an imperfect knowledge of what the market will do.  
  
Finally, you really should use capitalization in your posts.  Their absence makes what you write very difficult and unpleasant to read.

Plants are complex organisms that live rich, sensual lives. Plants can smell, hear, and communicate with each other.  They have short term memory, immune memory and even transgenerational memory.  They have ways of taking all the sensory data they gather in their everyday lives, integrating it and then behaving in appropriate ways in response. And they do this without brains, which, in a way, is what's incredible about it, because we tend to automatically assume you need a brain to process information.

The meaningful information is whether or not a trade would result in a profitable outcome, which is not the same for both players.  It is breathtakingly simple.  A person who stands to profit from a sale and one who does not are not in the same position.  Your entire argument completely disregards consideration of risk and profit, making it essentially delusional.  The only world in which it makes sense to disregard these considerations is one in which the players have perfect knowledge of what the market will do - which they never will.
  


  
It doesn't matter much what C and D represent as far as logic goes, but fine.  Don't think of it as addition, think of it as a thing that is true.  Both A and C being true does not imply that both B and D are true unless you assume a priori that C=D.   You have given no reason to conclude that C=D.  You've just stated that it is a fact derived from logic and cited the transitive property as your proof.  It is a tautology.       The entire question at hand is the actionable value of C and D and you assume as a given that they are the same.  This is essentially ANOTHER logical fallacy known as begging the question, in which the conclusion that one is attempting to prove is included in the initial premises of an argument.  It's fine to make a priori assumptions, but they are not logical inferences and cannot be offered as proof.  You must present reason to accept your a priori assumptions and you have not.  Your claim of a logical error is false, and I'm starting to believe you don't even really understand what logic is.  In any event, I've handily dismantled your notion that there is any inherent logical error.
  
The overall impression is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  You claim you are being logical, but your thinking is anything but.  You've displayed really shoddy reasoning, failed to justify any of your beliefs, repeatedly ignored requests for citations,  taken a position that is radically different than anything I've seen in the accepted literature on portfolio theory, and have committed a number of logical fallacies.  A pretty dazzling display of pseudo-intellectualism.

I don't think so.  The big reason we had to bail out the banks was that letting them fail would lead to a run, even on insured accounts.  The government would have to honor these accounts and what they would have to cover would exceed the cost of just propping them up.  
 
If they'd gone that route, let them fail and honor the insured accounts, the Fed could have just printed money to make the depositors whole as needed and let the failed banksters get wiped out.  
Then replace the bank executives with more competent people for much lower pay. Banks would be restructured and then sold back to the private sector. That is the way things are supposed to work in a market economy.

I've talked to a few bar and restaurant owners in NYC that I've known for a long time and encouraged them to do so.  It's triggered some long conversations.  Mostly, it just sounds like too much of a scam to them.  Even if they get past that gut feeling, they know they can't really pay their vendors in Bitcoin.  Say the bar needs a new floor, that guy isn't going to take Bitcoin for the work.  They also worry that the government will make it illegal.
  
The only thing that really seems to get them thinking is that they could pick up 2-3% on any sale with Bitcoin vs credit cards, but they don't expect a lot of people to use it, and training all the bartenders and waiters to accept it sounds like more trouble that it is worth.  I think, ultimately, this is the only real selling point for them if they can be convinced it isn't a scam.  Implementing it in a restaurant needs to get ridiculously easy for them though.  
  
One interesting thing someone told me, which doesn't have much to do with Bitcoin, is that the industry has drastically changed.  It used to be, say 10 years ago, that a bar would do a considerable cash business.  While arguably immoral, this allowed bar owners to take a good chunk of cash, maybe $250,000 or so a year for a pub-sized joint, and not declare it.   This would save them a good chunk of change in taxes and made all of the headaches of the industry worth it.  They could use this cash to pay vendors for things like repairs and expansions.
  
Now, 99% of all transactions are done on credit/debit cards.  Why wouldn't they be?  People get 2-3% back on their rewards cards and the like.  This makes every transaction trackable and kills that little sweet scam.  A couple I've talked to were wondering if Bitcoin could be a way to get some of this back.  Obviously not if they use a payment processor, and holding BTC is risky because of the volatility.  
  
Shady business, the bar industry.

An odd example.  No, they would only owe capital gains at the moment of sale/use.  If they destroyed the bitcoins, they could never sell and thus never see any capital gain.
If they mined the bitcoins, then yes, they owe (in the US anyway) income tax on the coin mined, with the basis being the fair market value on the day it was mined.
  
The IRS issued guidance - an interpretation of current law - not new laws.  Every dime ever made from Bitcoin, be it mined or otherwise, incurred a tax debt.  If it was not paid in the year in which the debt was taken on, then you are liable for penalties and possible prison time.

I remember when I was in first grade and they used to put up the 8th-graders artwork on the walls.   I envied their skills and looked forward to getting older so that I too could have awesome drawing abilities.
  
I get to the 8th grade?  Couldn't draw worth a shit.  *Still* can't draw worth a shit.  It was a hard lesson.  Nothing is owed to anyone and nothing is guaranteed.  We're not all really equal.  Some people are better at things than other people and always will be. Some things take massive amounts of hard work for some people to be good at while others skate by on natural talent.

I don't really get the question.  What everyone *should* do is buy the asset that is going to increase by the most.  Since there is no way for them to know that, what they do should factor in their circumstances, the history of the market (if nothing else than the knowledge that, overall, it tends to go up over time), and their understanding of the volatility of the asset that interests them.
  
But again, I don't see what your examples have to do with what we are talking about.  Are you suggesting that everyone should invest exactly the same way?  I mean, at the very least you are saying that their beliefs should influence their choice.  In that sense you also  are saying they should have different strategies (if they have differing beliefs).  Likewise if they have a different cost basis, amount of time in the investment, or differing levels of understanding of the market and the underlying asset behind an investment, they should have different strategies.

Nothing, but they'd be in violation if anyone in New York ever used the service.  A warrant could be issued for the arrest of whomever runs the company that runs the tipbot.  If they are in a country with an extradition policy with the US, they will likely be arrested there by local authorities and extradited.  
   
So anyone wanting to run a tipbot and not comply will need to never travel to the US or any country which has an extradition policy with the US.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  Most of the challenges to having great infrastructure at this point seem to be legislative, not technical.  How do we fix this?  
  
Seriously, what's the plan?  We need to lobby?  Do we need a grassroots campaign?  Mid-terms are coming up, do we need to start getting on the phone to our representatives?  What is the specific call to action (which you've outlined here to a degree)?  Do we have specific legislation we want passed?  Is it written?  Who writes those sorts of things? 
  
To date, the only thing I've really seen that felt like progress (the smallest, tiniest amount of progress) was at the New York hearings on Bitcoin where the Winklevii, the co-founder of Coinbase and several others plead their case to government officials.  
  
There was a lot of talk about how compliance is too large of a burden for startups and innovation will be pushed offshore if we aren't welcoming here.  The other days of the hearings the ridiculously dumb feds (who didn't really seem to even understand the concept of mining) were telling the same panel that looser regulation would enable terrorism and drug cartels to kill babies.  
  
Who is fighting for our side?  Is there any organized effort at all?  What does a grassroots movement look like?  Do we need one in every state?  When we call them, how do we counter the argument that any loosening of the laws enables bad people to do bad things via money laundering?  Is it a better idea to say fuck it and not worry too much about their rules - they'll inevitibly have to get out of the way at some point (once the banks and other special interests are the ones poised to profit most)?  
  
I'm not asking you specifically, I'm just thinking out loud here.  It seems the midterms offer a good opportunity to try to spread the word to politicians that we need some help on this out here in the trenches.  Especially given that they can now accept crypto donations.  
  
Is that a good entry point?  Calling up to ask if they accept bitcoin donations?

So in this case there has to exist a poll-able data source and someone who knows how to program a pull of that data.  This makes it a system only usable to a really narrow set of people (those with programming skills).  It also doesn't help with complicated bounties and the like.  Has software been created that does X,Y, and Z?  Did the person create a painting of a dog?  etc.  
  
I envision systems anyone can use, whether they are programmers or not and any win conditions can be set by users whether it can use a data feed or not.  I can imagine a system with a number of built in sources you could choose from, the ability to point to an unlisted data source, or the option to rely on the crowds.  
  
The person who initially poses the bet/request/bounty selects all of these and you get your conditional setup and all can see exactly what they are getting into and whether they trust a given oracle system.

@_date: 2014-08-20 13:43:10
Ok, this seems amazing for individuals. A few questions:  
  
Does selling Bitcoin for cash mean it is not a 'personal use asset' any more?  Does the no tax thing only apply if you are buying a good or a service?  Does cash count as a good (ie buying cash for bitcoin)?
  
So, if I'm reading right, any BTC bought for under $10k per bitcoin would not be taxed when it is spent.  So what if the price of Bitcoin inflates to $12,000 next month and never goes to anything less than $10,000 ever again?  Does that mean Australians are back to capital gains taxes on it?  
  
Wouldn't this mean, if you believe in Bitcoin, that all Australians should buy AS MUCH AS HUMANLY possible before Bitcoin hits that price?

Using an iPhone doesn't make you 'in the cell phone space'.  Playing with a toy does not mean a child is 'in the toy space'.  I've no idea why you are being so obtuse.  Anyone providing a service in the industry will be adversely affected by the regulations as proposed.  Anybody offering a web service or product will require a license.  Anyone simply publishing a crypto currency protocol will require a license.  Anyone running a tipbot will require a license.  Anyone running an exchange will require a license.  Anyone who is a miner will require a license (they arguably issue the currency).  Anyone running online wallets will require a licence.  It is blatantly obvious to everyone of any note commenting on the matter.  No one anywhere is suggesting that individual users or merchants are the ones being screwed here, and yet, every major player is saying this is terrible regulation.

That didn't happen.  From day 1 the 10,000 coin block rewards for ever were built in.  It was a mistake they made setting it up, one they intended on changing at first, but after thought decided to turn it from a bug into a feature.  But no code was changed.  
  
The only change they've ever made to the structure was disabling random block rewards because multipools figured out how to predict which blocks were going to be the biggest and only jump on for those, essentially gaming the system.

Fair enough.  In that spirit...
  


  
It's 'satoshis'.  Satoshis are the minimum divisible unit of a bitcoin.  They aren't an analogy.  If you use a gold analogy, it really has nothing to do with the satoshi denomination.  
  


  
No, it's a ledger.  You can trace the history of coins to a degree. Once a coin is sent to an address, you can see where coin was then sent from that address, but if it already had coin in it, they would all be mixed together.  Each bitcoin does not have an individual label or assignment per se.  It is just amounts in a ledger, making it totally fungible. Bitcoins do not have unique identifiers like say cash US dollars.  
From a language perspective, the word 'am' here should be 'an'.  Something is 'an inventory system' (not bitcoin though). 'An' is the form of the indefinite article used before words beginning with a vowel sound. 'Am' is the 1st person singular present of 'be'.  I 'am' a redditor.  
  


  
No, once the bitcoin is in an address with other bitcoin there is no way to identify which portion came from which initial mining reward.  The integrity of the batch origin is not maintained.  Grammar wise on this section, you don't need to put a space before a colon.  The last entry in a list of things separated by commas should have either 'and' or an 'or'.  So, for example: "1, 2, or three."  "Pineapples, apples and oranges."


  
You want to say 'decides' here instead of decide.  Totalizing isn't a word, you would just use 'total'.  Again, the concept of 'batches' doesn't really apply usefully to the blockchain.

When playing bitcoin, you hold onto your own ball for free.  Every time you want to play with the ball, you are free to do so, no charge.  If you want someone else to be able to use your ball, you can give it to them instantly (for free), no matter where they are on the planet.  
  
If you hold onto your ball for long enough, it may end up providing enough wealth to keep you balls-deep in hookers and blow.  But that's a whole other ball game...

Like any adult investor, you must not just throw money blindly into your investments of choice.  You have to do research in advance.  You wouldn't just hand your IRA investment to any schmoe, you'd check to make sure that you were dealing with a reputable company of account.
Any person who does even a cursory amount of research into how to invest in a cryptocurrency, will be met frequently with the warning and advice not to keep your stake in exchanges.  Anyone who even spent a single hour googling cryptocurrency exchanges would have quickly learned of MtGox's notoriously inept nature.
If a novice is incapable or unwilling to do even the most basic research before investing, then it is probably best that he or she not even enter the market as an investor.  May as well just gamble it away at blackjack.

Smart phones have been the fastest, most widely adopted technology in the history of technology.

You are being so inconsistent.  Let's just keep it to logic to be clear.  I will present my understanding of your argument, and you correct with the same style and notation.  
  
Let **A** be a person.  
Let **B** be a person.  
Let **C** be a cost basis less than the current market price of an asset.  
Let **D** be a cost basis equal to the current market price of an asset.  
Let **E** be a correct behavior.  
    
You propose that:  
  
Given **A=B** 
*(both people are exact equals, all things considered)*
    
  
If (**A+C**) then **E**.  
(*If A's cost basis is less than the market price then perform behavior E*)  
  
and that  
   
If (**B**+**D**) then **E**.  
*(If B's cost basis is equal to the current cost then perform behavior E).*
    
The transitive property is useless here.  A=B and B=A but it does you no good.  C does not equal D and therefore you cannot infer that B+D implies E just because A+C does.   
    
Show me where I am wrong, in either my logic or my understanding of your logic.  Do it without telling me that you are right and I am wrong and that is a fact because you said so.  Use logic to state your argument and then support your inferences and point out the error in my logic you claim exists.

Furthermore, some people will undoubtedly invest in bitcoin and keep their portion of bitcoin away from the transactional pool, like all people tend to hoard money if they are able. This decreases the amount of bitcoin that must fulfill the market share, further driving up value for each individual bitcoin. As a rough estimate, let’s assume that only one in four bitcoins is actually used in transactions, and the rest are in some kind of savings or investment plans.

Meh.  It all seems pretty decentralized to me.  
On the rest of it:
  
1.  I don't think a lot of people have expressed a sense of invulnerability.  I see threads here every day about very real threats and concerns.  Things like unfavorable regulations.  Theft.  Mining centralization.  Scalability.  Usefulness.  A day doesn't go by that some existential threat isn't bandied as needing our attention and solutions.  
  
2. Rationalization.  Meh, I guess some people.  Being rational is a good thing.  If anyone's thinking is incorrect and they are able to be presented with rational debate (as opposed to ad hominem, appeals to authority, and begging the question), then those points usually lead to interesting discussion and the proposal of possible solutions.  Sure, there are true believers, but most people seem pretty reasonable and intelligent, having arrived at their conclusions via rational thought.  I can't cite this as a negative thing.  
  
3.  Morality.  How's that?  Who is ignoring ethical consequences?  What, exactly, are the immoral consequences being ignored?
  
4.  Stereotypes.  I guess.  It's pretty non-specific.  Bankers, yeah.  Government officials, sure.  Regulatory bodies, ok.  I think there is a pretty strong case to be made that these organizations are corrupt and rigged against the common man, so I'll concede this one, I guess.  Again though, it seems like a pretty rational conclusion based on the data.  I'm sure that some bankers, politicians and regulators are lovely people, but on whole, their actions leave a lot to be desired. 
  
5. Pressure.  Not at all.  Who is pressuring whom?  No one is threatening anyone.  'Should I buy' questions are typically met with sound advice about volatility and not investing more than you need.  No one has approached me on the street trying to sell bitcoins.  Doubts are presented and debated frequently with multiple sides and viewpoints being offered.  Not seeing it. 
  
6.  Self-censorship.  Yeah, not so much.  This topic, for example.  I find no shortage of people expressing doubts.  
  
7.  Unanimity.  You are kidding, right?  Constant bickering and debate is kind of the opposite of that.  
  
8.  Mindguards.  Full of shit.  There are no leaders.  Ideas are judged on their merit.  There is no king, cult leader, or figurehead.  Just smart people presenting ideas and other smart people considering and dissecting them.  
  
Overall a pretty weak correlation.

You can't.  That's the whole point.  If you had perfect knowledge of what the market will do then, yes, it wouldn't make sense to DCA.   But since no one, not even top fund managers, can accurately predict highs and lows DCA is a hedge against entering the market at the top.  
  
You don't know in advance whether your current purchase is the high or the low or somewhere in between.  You end up buying more when it is low by default with DCA, not because you knew it would happen, but because you are buying the same dollar amount no matter what happens.
  


  
Why should you not hedge against the fact that your belief may be wrong?  Why would you act like you have perfect knowledge when you never will?

Have a read of the Satoshi Bitcoin white paper. Cryptocurrencies represent a tremendous innovation. This innovation puts a lot of big fee businesses in the crosshairs. Just the global remittance business alone is worth $500 billion a year. Immigrants sending money back to their home countries are raked over the coals with fees, and that business alone will lead to cryptos thriving. Cryptos could eat Paypal's and Western Unions lunch.
On the merchant side, big retailers work on razor-thin margins, so accepting cryptos can be a big win for them, adding a couple of points to their margins. What they need is reliable payment processors and no risk, and the infrastructure to allow all of that is going up at an insane pace.  It's essentially there already.
Further, as smart phones become dirt cheap, and get distributed across the planet into third world economies, every person who lives there and has productive potential but no way to sell it, will all of the sudden have a transaction manager, a storefront, and a seat at the global marketplace with the phone and cryptos. Imagine hiring someone across the planet to write you a poem, or make you a necklace from African sea shells. To transcribe your audio notes, or serve as an assistant, managing your calendar and keeping you updated on whatever you need. Maybe doing some research, or coding.  
  
Looking past the day-to-day drama of the market, it appears to me that cryptos could easily come to represent a couple of hundred billion in commerce within a few years. It is simply a better, more profitable technology. Something like cryptos are inevitable, because it is a better technology.
So, I firmly believe that the marketcaps of cryptos are going to eventually grow at least 10x, maybe as much as 100x in the not so distant future. I feel that is a conservative estimate. If they really take off and realize their potential, it could be much bigger. We may see a trilion dollar market cap for the total of all cryptos some day.

This is patently untrue.  DCA means you buy fewer shares when the market is high and more shares when it's low. This lessens the risk of investing a large amount in a single investment at the wrong time, and in a falling market, the average cost per share becomes smaller and smaller. This lessening average cost per share yields better overall profits as the market increases over the long term.  
  
DCA is a risk-reducing tactic.  Not for everyone, and not the best in every situation, but to say it is as useless as random guesses or superstition is incorrect.

Back in about 1992 my dad went into a Lowes hardware store in the south.  They were selling PCs as kind of a pilot program, seeing if they could make any money in the business. There was a floor model 486 PC, which was pretty sweet at the time and ran about $2,000 (which we couldn't afford).  My dad was an engineer on the railroad, but he had spent his free time reading the DOS manual and learning everything he could about our little 286 running straight DOS (5.0 if I recall correctly).  
  
The floor model was borked.  It wasn't working at all and the owner of the franchise was fed up, not understanding computers and not doing well trying to sling them out of a hardware store.  He thought the machine was broken.  
  
My dad offered him $100 for it on the spot and the guy took him up on it (shortly thereafter they stopped selling computers).  He brought it home, plugged it in, placed a DOS disk in it and typed 'unformat c:'.  
  
Boom.  Instantly the whole machine restored itself.  Some wiseass punk had gone into the store and typed 'Format c:' into the machine and Lowes was stumped.  End result, our house had a brand new top-end machine for 1/20th of the cost.  I learned a tremendous amount using that machine over the next few years and make my living today based on skills that started with figuring that thing out.  
  
I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Lowes.  Sweet, awesome, dimwitted Lowes.  If they ever end up accepting Bitcoin, I'll probably take a hit right in the feels.

As sub-$25 smartphones penetrate the third world over the next few years, with a smartphone and bitcoin billions of people will have themselves a seat at the global marketplace.  
  
All those souls who have creative and productive potential, but no way to monetize it because they were born on the wrong side of the planet, will be able to communicate instantly with people all over the world.  They will sell their services and be paid in cryptos, their phone serving as a storefront, payment processor and personal bank.  
 
This could manifest as someone in Africa making necklaces out of local sea shells, or hiring someone to be your personal assistant from afar.  "Hey, I'll give you 1000 bits if you research this topic for me."  
  
It's not the western world that is going to really juice up bitcoin, it's the rest of the world whose options are limited that will flock to this technology.  Big money here won't sit on the sidelines either, but it looks like massive, empowering adoption is coming soon in faraway places.

Yeah, and it looked like this:
  
**Step 1**: Assume that dollar cost averaging is worthless.  
**Step 2**: Therefore, dollar cost averaging is worthless.
 
Not convincing.  You've given no logical reason to accept 1.  
  


  
Yeah, I have.  And every economics professor I've ever had has leveraged tools, depending on the risk and volatility of a given asset, such as dollar cost averaging for highly volatile assets, value  averaging, and the like.  All of these tools in the toolbox have utility according to every trader I've ever spoken to.  In a world where we cannot predict what a market will do with any accuracy, these tools are hedges against risk and therefore useful, particularly in the case of volatile assets.  Bitcoin is insanely volatile.

You are kidding right?  None of that applies.  They were not identical, you specifically introduced that they had DIFFERENT cost basis.  
 
A + B = C
A + D = C. 
  
Where B and D are the different cost basis.  There is no logical reason for that inference.  
  


  
You are like the most wrong person I've seen in weeks.  Two things that are different are exactly the same because 'logic' and 'I said so'.  Don't diversify.  Always invest with 100% confidence in your beliefs.  Cost basis doesn't matter.  Never lock in profits.

I think we are going to see a decrease in value as the Silk Road coins hit the market.  It will probably get priced in and I expect to see the decrease before the coins are actually sold.  
  
I think the low price will effect confidence and we'll linger through July and into early August.   
  
In late August, as students come back to school, I expect us to see a rapid increase in price, especially once the MIT students start tweeting and facebooking about the bitcoin economy that will sprout up in Cambridge to accommodate them.  Right about this time we'll also see the first Wall Street funds coming online, and they are going to need to purchase coin for the funds.  
  
September and October I see massive gains.  We'll hit another exponential rise by the end of the year and will trade somewhere around $5,000 per coin.

Yes, the purchase doesn't incur any gain until it is sold (and then only if sold at a profit, a loss would offset any capital gains tax owed) or spent.  The miner is considered to be doing work and being compensated for it, thus it is income and taxed at the higher rate.

This is nonsense - you are arguing points no one is making.  DCA does not imply basing today's decision on yesterday's results.  Anyone whose taken an intro level statistics class knows that when you flip a coin, past flips have no effect on the probability of the current flip.  No one is saying they do.  However, given an uncertain, volatile market, DCA is a great risk reduction tool.  Your initial premise was that DCA is of as much utility as randomness and superstition and that is completely untrue.  It is a risk mitigation tool that is particularly effective in volatile markets.  It has utility.   You don't have to KNOW what the market will do.  DCA is so valuable because you DON'T know and never will.  
  


  
Actually, they can't.  Indexes, straight up investing in the Dow, or [monkeys throwing darts]( at stock picks can outperform brokers.  There is no tactic short of insider trading that can consistently beat the market.  If there was, we'd all be rich.  
  


if your profits or losses have changed your circumstances, then your circumstances may dictate a change in the amount you hold, but that change is still a function of your current circumstances, not your past performance. if you are claiming otherwise, you are simply incorrect.  
  
I said "your cost basis absolutely should effect whether you hold an asset or not".  You said "that's simply wrong".  In the very same paragraph you said "your circumstances may dictate a change in the amount you hold".  Huh?  Yeah, like I said.  Your circumstances (your cost basis relative to current price) should effect your behavior.  You basically said your basis absolutely doesn't effect how much of an asset you should continue to hold and it also does.  You are making no sense.  
  




yet you claim it is more right for one to sell and the other to buy.
  
This example has nothing to do with what we are discussing.  In an example that would have anything to do with what we are talking about, person X would have bought 1000 shares a year ago at a lower price and person Y would have bought 1000 shares a day ago at the current price.  Yes, it makes sense for the person who is up to sell and lock in profits and not so for the person who is not up and just got in.  Your circumstances, cost basis, and time in an investment absolutely are factors that should be weighed when making a decision to buy or sell.  
  


  
Thank you.  I appreciate it.

Calm down there, sparky.  It's a Deadwood quote.  SPOILER. Francis Wolcott, played by Garret Dillahunt (his second roll in the series), is the chief geologist of wealthy San Francisco mining magnate George Hearst.  He arrives in camp in order to ascertain whether any of the claims might be of value to the Hearst empire, and if so, to set about acquiring them by any means necessary. He is also a twisted fuck and proceeds to murder several prostitutes with a straight razor.  He enlists Cy Tolliver to operate as the front for his operation and when his murders are discovered, essentially just pays a fee to Cy for the 'service'. Wolcott is a self-deprecating and unstable character. He has a sexually violent attitude towards women to say the least. He seems unable to control these impulses and struggles to explain them, showing at times sorrow and regret for doing them, feeling ashamed in front of what he sees as normal people.  
  
At one point, a government official comes to town looking for bribes from Deadwood to grease the palms of the magistrates to increase the likelihood of positive results when the inevitable annexation by the Dakota Territory occurs.  Wolcott is drinking whiskey at the bar when the official informs Cy of the need for him to kick in a bribe.  When the official leaves, Wolcott utters the line I used.  
  
The gist would be that being a government official is the worse sin than the rape and murder of prostitutes.

My point is that it would be no more centrally unilateral in the case of Bitcoin then it would be in Vericoin's.  Without network consensus, no changes get made.  The lion's share of VTC owners could reject this fork, but they obviously won't.  Everything is working exactly like it is supposed to.  If people preferred the thieves get the coins they could refuse the wallet update.  
  
It still requires network consensus. In this case, the network deems this the appropriate action given the circumstances.  I think it is a great display of the resiliency of the technology and its ability to adapt.

Just because people rely on a company for a job, does not mean we prop up failed companies.  If an organization is untenable, it has to go.  I'm fully aware of all the support jobs at an Investment Bank, having worked for JPMorgan (and later JPMorgan Chase) for 8 years.  Tons of those people got laid off anyway in 2008.  
  
If the government had seized and restructured the banks, many of those people would be out of a job, but many of them wouldn't either.  The support staff would have percentages that stayed on even through receivership.  
  
What you are doing here is doubly disingenuous.  First in suggesting that it is the governments place to protect failed businesses because those businesses have employees, and second with the absolutism that suggests that they would all lose their jobs.  Finally, all of these people would have skill sets that would allow them to find jobs either in the restructured organizations or elsewhere in companies who have sustainable business models.  
  
The individuals, just as society as a whole, would feel the squeeze and have to sacrifice (as many ended up doing anyway), but they would end up in the better organizations that replaced them.  As it is, the banks (and all most all sectors) used 2008 to have massive layoffs, salary freezes, and pay cuts.  Those same support people tend to do the same work for less money now.  With raises for support staff tending towards being lower than inflation, these positions effectively make less every year.  The whole thing turned into a huge transfer of wealth, and the banksters paid no price for it. Those support staff would have been much better off in the long run had the banks been allowed to fail, as would the rest of us.  
  
Your personal bias is not allowing you to see clearly here.  You are using appeals to emotion and suggesting the absurd notion that failed businesses should be propped up by the government because people work at them.  By that logic no company would ever be allowed to fail, and our 'market economy' would be anything but.  It's a ludicrous proposition.
  
Yes, it sucks when people lose their jobs, but that is by no means a guarantee of always having that job for a particular organization.  Fairness doesn't really come into it.  Either a business is solvent or not.  The way things worked out has been used as a hammer against support staff, eroding their pay, benefits and expecting them to be thankful for the scraps they have left, while banks are back in record profits land, now with an excuse not to share those profits.

In my example, person X and Y have different life situations, the same amount of shares, investments with different attributes (namely whether they are profitable relative to their cost basis), different tax liabiliities, and yes, they should have different strategies.  They are not identical in any way accept for the amount of shares they hold.
  
Can you cite anything that says anything like what you are suggesting?  To me it sounds like you are saying that people should try to time the market, ignore their cost basis, not diversify and have absolute certainty about everything that they invest in, all of which sounds completely absurd and a likely way to come up a loser.  
  
I do agree that if you have a lump sum, and the choice is between investing and not investing, you should definitely invest it.  Cash is a guaranteed loss at the rate of inflation.  But if you are investing as you earn, DCA is great.  Even for a lump sum, you are better off diversifying into multiple assets and then DCA'ing into them as you earn rather than holding that cash and trying to time the market.

I'm ok with that.  They deserved to.  And I don't see how you get to 30%.  The finance and insurance industry has about 6 million workers.  The housing markets about 2 million.  Throw in the construction industry for another 6 million.  Even assuming every one of them was out of a job (they wouldn't be) that's nowhere near 30% unemployment.  We'd be looking at 13 or 14%, tops.  And that wouldn't take decades to fix.

This is literally not possible.  Two people who are identical in every way are the same person.  But fine, let's indulge your impossible proposal as a thought exercise.  
  
If there was an exact copy of me and he held the same amount of Bitcoin that I do but was in the green a significant percentage while I had a cost basis of the current price, then yes, I believe the me who has managed to predict the market correctly should sell a portion of his holdings, locking in profit, while the other me should sit tight.
  


  
DCA is not a metric so much as it is a method that serves well the belief that the market cannot be accurately timed with any reliability.  If you are saying that your cost basis (a metric) is something that should not factor into whether you should sell or not, well that is utterly ridiculous and I've never heard the likes of it.  Whether or not you have achieved a profit is in essence the most important question in the game.

The obsessive, aggressive manner in which this person is pursued borders on mental illness.  Make your case and let everyone make their own decisions.  From there it is buyer beware.  The non-stop onslaught, the ever changing demands, the painting of oneself as a martyr and a hero, and the disingenuous propaganda techniques of 'just asking questions' all point to someone who is unwell.   
  
This does not look, to most reasonable people, like a request for transparency and clarity.  It reads as a quest to destroy a person/business at all costs.  It reads as an unhealthy obsession. This manic, aggressive attacking as a way of doing things only muddies your message.  It makes one doubt the speaker and their motivations.  
  
Let me ask you this.  What are the conditions under which you would be satisfied and leave the company/man alone? List them.  Don't make a case or argument, just a list of the things that you think need to be done.  Once you've made your case and the call to action, there really isn't much to do.  Move on.

Really?  Just saying 'you're wrong and that's not an opinion' is not a convincing argument.  Support the assertion.  What is the logical error?  You did not respond to my request for a citation supporting your line of thinking.  If there is a school of thought in portfolio theory that aligns with the idea you have in your head, I'm happy to consider it.  Perhaps the literature of professionals can better bridge whatever is getting lost in translation.
  


  
Again, you aren't offering anything here that explains where the supposed hole in the logic is.  Instead, you're only saying 'it's wrong' and 'a fallacy' without providing any reasoning or explaining how or why you come to the conclusion.  I've taken discrete math and first order logic.  Feel free to use discrete notation to illustrate the heretofore unstated (yet referenced) logical error.  
  


  
This response has nothing to do with the line you quoted above it.  It is, however, a logical fallacy known as an appeal to authority, which relies on a statistical syllogism.  You'll forgive me if no, I won't take your word for it.  You'll have to let the argument speak for itself.

That may be, but it points to an area of weakness.  The bitcoin community seems a bit lackluster in the marketing prowess arena.  I know techies tend never to place high value on the creatives, particularly soul-less marketers, but it is an important factor for any brand that wishes to see wide adoption.  The doge community are branding superstars so far.

But those tests have trillions of variables, aren't reproducible, and there is no way to have a control.  It isn't scientific at all, really.  Contradictory schools of economics look at the same data and point to contradictory conclusions.  It's like a giant Rorschach test. No matter what data emerges, many economists do not change their thinking.  A Keynesian looks at the metrics and says 'See, I told you!'.  A Chicago School adherent looks at the same data and is likewise vindicated.  
  
In the hard sciences, you can say 'If you do x, then y will happen. I invite the world to reproduce the process I have described and see for yourself.'  You can repeat that experiment, you can have peer review, etc.  If economists theories had any predictable value, all of the best would be billionaires.  They aren't.  It isn't predictive, it isn't falsifiable.  That's not to say it isn't useful, just not as useful as empiricism.

That's a tricky loophole and one FINcen is likely to grow to expand to cover in the future.  Their latest guidance really only spoke about Administrators and Exchangers, and it's arguable that online wallets do not meet either criteria (it's arguable that they *do* as well).  This loophole gets stronger if the company does not hold the private keys.  
  
Of course, making use of this would mean that the company could not accept cash to buy the coins and could not pay out in cash.  It would be like the tipbots - you transfer funds in and you can then point them at any address.  I fully expect FINcen to hit online wallets and tipping services with expanded guidance in the future, bringing them 'into the fold' as it were, but for now that would seem to work.  
Doesn't really profit the game in any way though, really.  If you issue Ðogecoins in game for example (mining of a sort), you are an MSB and your players are liable for income tax on those earnings, so that's out.  Really, all they will be able to do in this scenario is essentially have a tipping function. Which is cool, but certainly not the in-game crypto economy we all dream about.  That will take a game spending the $5 mil or so it takes to properly register as a money transmitter in all 50 states.  It will also require users to give up a lot of personal info to participate.
  
Personally, I'd confirm my identity for such a game, because it sounds awesome.  But when the cost of compliance outweighs the cost of development by about a factor of 20x, it becomes unlikely we'll see a game that achieves this any time soon.  Going to take some deep pockets and a lot of red tape and time to accomplish.

Haha.   I know enough, to head off criticism at the path, enough about doge, but I just spent the last two weeks filling out captchas.  So I have some anecdotal experience that may be fun to hear and a perhaps insight into a more interesting phenomenon.
  
With the Josh Wise voting, the more you voted, the harder the captchas got.  Like 'Mike Tyson's Punch Out' final-fight hard.  Yet I, like many others, spent hours and hours solving these things.  After a while, your perception shifts.  You start to notice a greater meaning in the words.  They no longer appear random.    
  
First, you've got the seeming bastardizations of words that suggest common sayings.  Things that scream to an oddly specific synchronicity related to the task at hand. The captchas start to seem to have meaning.  You'll get one that kind of looks like the word 'Danica' , maybe 'bancia', but the way it's curved looks like, or should I say evokes, the familiar.
  
Enough of these things happen and you start to suspect that there is some human out there, creating these things against you specifically. The random fragments are turned in your mind into a subtle, sly commentary on the thing you are voting on.  These random captachas actually represent some tech or team of techs, generating them manually, and in the sheer boredom of the task turn to hiding commentary in them,   Using words and shapes that evoke other words, well, let's just say I've laughed at more than just one cosmic accident the 'random' letters formed, but wondered more about the bored tech who etched the subtle joke into the process.
  
Fill out enough captchas, and they become full of meaning.

I like to think that, in those quiet moments by himself, it stings and hurts his feelings. That he really wanted this community to like him and he is genuinely excited about this technology like any nerd would be.  
  
I like to think that it plants a tiny seed of self-hatred in him, what he is having to do to advance his career.  A seed that will grow and fester with time, and unfortunately ends up with him lashing out and turning his self-loathing into a weapon to strike out at the world with.  
  
He's going to make things a real pain in the ass for a while, which sucks, but he will eventually lose in spectacular, public fashion. Maybe that will drive him to suicide.  When his self-hatred becomes impotent as a weapon, when he loses all respect and power. With nothing external bearing the  weight of this  hatred any longer, it will again turn inward.  And in that moment at the bottom, in that dark depth of depression as waves of self-loathing wash over him, he will remember that he betrayed the community he hoped to befriend.  Even worse, he deserved his rejection and his unhappiness.  He could have been a shining example to the world, and instead he let himself be bought and compromised, presenting a false front, ultimately a con and a liar.

The value of all the gold currently in the world is around $7 trillion USD.  If bitcoin were to ever equal that as a store of value, pretty much wildest dreams win conditions, each coin would be worth around $350,000, assuming they are all mined.  Given lost coins and assuming this happens before all the coins are mined, so maintaining such a store of value would require a higher price per coin, one million dollars per coin isn't out of the question.  
  
It's a long shot.  But it's not impossible.  In a world in which there will be 200 trillion plus dollars (10 - 20 years), I think bitcoin storing  2 or 3 percent of it may very well be possible.

You don't seem that bright.  
  


  
Yes, it is a considerable expense.  They have to pay for machines to hold the data, IT folks to run the infrastructure to hold and process the data, content manager types to maintain workflows, compliance staffing to make sure records are being entered, stored and secured in compliance with state and federal laws, training infrastructure so that all who use the systems know how to use them, HR and payroll expenses associated with maintaining all that staff, software developers, etc.  How would a blockchain solve any of this?  I don't see it.  They are still going to need computers, storage, networks, people to run them, training, etc.  The only possible thing a distributed system could do is store the data (which you say wouldn't be stored by the distributed system) or serve as some form of universal login/proof of person-hood. And even for that proof of personhood, having a crypto-key doesn't tell you that the person holding the key is that person, just that they know the key.  
  


  
If it's voluntary, how is it invitation only?  How do you have something that has a gatekeeper without hiring/electing a gatekeeper and funding them?  How will you process applications?  Who approves them?  Who pays for that labor?  Who pays for the offices for those approvers to sit in?  Who oversees whether they are administering these duties properly?  There is a ton of additional cost to this system, and little (if any) advantage.
  


  
I don't see why this needs distributed consensus to achieve.  What is the equivalent of a double spend for medical records?  Are people creating simultaneous fake medical histories across the world?  This hardly seems like it would be of any benefit to the patient, who would have a vested interest in it being accurate.  Anyone with the patients key could add records at will as well, whether they are true or false.  


Go fuck yourself and then, when you're finished, go fuck your whore mother what birthed ya'.  
  


'V9542XA' is enough to record 'Spacecraft crash injuring occupant, initial encounter'
'V91.07XA' is 'Burn due to waterskis on fire, initial encounter'

Lol.  The solution is a decentralized market of Oracles.  Of course.  I imagine they could have different prices as well.  A person willing to research complicated questions/predictions could get paid more for their oracle service.  
  
Blockchain addresses could have associated Oracle reliability ratings.  Without ever knowing who controls an address you could see the reliability ranking and the rate they charge for oracle services.  
EDIT:  You could also select multiple oracles and take an average of them, to protect against a single one being incorrect or suddenly becoming unreliable.  The more I think about it, this is much better than just a general crowd oracle.  I can see the user being presented with 1000s of oracles competing on reliability and price, and depending on the bet it could make sense to have 1, 10, or 100 of the top oracles weigh in.  The oracle fees wouldn't have to be very high for thousands of people to get involved and offer their services.

He is still complicit, yes.  As for not being able to do it, I mean, no shit. It's hard to get by in the world without a nation state backing you.  Renounce your citizenship and you are likely in for a world of hurt and inconvenience.  Avoiding that hurt and inconvenience makes you complicit in the actions of the nation state of which you remain a citizen.

There is a path out of the requirements of being a member of our society, but you must also relinquish the *benefits* of being a member, and then face the metaphorical lions and see how much they respect what you think your rights are.

I mean, your statement that you cannot renounce citizenship in the US is patently false.  People do it.  It has been done.  It can be done.  Yes, the conditions for renouncing citizenship include leaving the territory - the territory  which being a citizen previously afforded you the 'right' to openly and safely travel.  Good luck claiming a piece of this world as a single stateless person.  That it puts a person in such a detrimental position merely reinforces the point that anything that a common person calls rights disappear without the say so of a nation state backing you.  
I'm not rationalizing anything or saying that the behavior of any nation state is desirable.  Merely that rights come from and only make sense in the context of them.  Rights are a fluid changing thing which have morphed and varied depending on the time, government and geography all throughout history.  They are not static.  They are not some immovable baseline axiom whose contours are clear for all to see and prove.  They are a synthesis of individual will and group dynamics that behaves as an equation which produces different outcomes if you put in different values.  There are no rights of any kind outside of this context.

Absent the power to enforce a claim to that right, you do not have it.  The universe promises you no right not to get eaten or burnt or crushed.  The point is that nothing in the universe acknowledges anything we consider to be rights, other than, of course, other humans.  Rights are born solely of the human mind and are meaningless without the means to claim and defend them.  Rights do not exist in nature, they are an intellectual construct. A construct we find to be mutually beneficial to use as governing principles for a society, but a construct nonetheless.

Not quite sure how you get to that strained conclusion.  It's more like you can't take the lion on your own.  There are, however, other people.  Together, you can probably kill the lion.  So you agree to form a team, collectively agree that you have the 'right' not to be killed (while extending no such right to the lion - because natural rights don't exist), and team up and kill it.  
  
Now you've benefited from this group protection, both defensively and offensively.  The cost of maintaining this group and the benefits it provides is that you all come to an agreement about how you treat each other, and how costs of running the group are shared.  
  
Thus we form tribes, cities, nation states and governments that declare rights to be inalienable.  You don't like it, in the US anyway, you are free to leave the group's protection.  But there are a lot of metaphorical lions out there...

Yes, it is the citizenship which keeps you from being deprived of anything that you would consider a right.  Because without it, the universe promises you nothing to be deprived of in the first place.  


  
I'm having trouble parsing you here.  Are you referring to territory in the sense of the literal territory which the hypothetical renouncee forfeits the right to travel unaccosted across? Or the philosophical and metaphorical 'territory' of the question of rights?  Either way, I'm not sure which claim you are referencing and therefore what you are challenging.  Sorry this paragraph makes no sense to me.  I can't discern what you're positing or what you are challenging.


  
Religions are different in many ways, though there are similarities.  I don't see what the similarities have to do with anything, unless you posit religion as another potential source of rights, which I'd concede.  It's the same in that they state claims to rights and then must defend them or they don't exist.


  
Sorry, I'm completely unable to understand this paragraph as well.  It looks like you switch thoughts mid-sentence a few times.  What does it mean to 'recognize rights in marginal abilities to enforce them'?  What do courts being in error have anything to do with anything?  How does courts not being infallible have anything at all to do with the question of from whence rights  derive?  What is an 'enforcement and violation of rights', specifically?  How does my recognition that rights are fluid and changing in any way compromise my opinion on the origin of those rights?  What does 'legislates violations of rights' mean? Who decides which protections are rights and which are violations if not the nation state?
  
Sorry, most of your post made absolutely no sense to me.  It's not that I disagree with what you are saying.  I"m truly not parsing your meaning at all.  Perhaps if you could summarize your points in simple, brief plain language.

If he is in the US, the mining is considered and taxed as income (based on the fair market rate at the time the coin was mined).  The IRS published guidance, not rule changes, effectively saying 'we have always considered mining to be taxable income' with the implication being that it was owed for years before the guidance came out.  
  
So however long he kept his miners on from the time bitcoin first had a fair-market value, he owed income tax each year.  If he didn't pay it, he is exposed to potential fees and penalties.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:25:52
Property taxes and any income earned from the things they produce, yes.  That land is safe and that life sustainable because of the protection the nation state on which it resides has provided.  Their family has had the privilege and ability to hold and own that land only as a direct result of the government that has protected that right.  There are no property rights outside of government.
  
The crux of the matter is that simply not paying taxes in no way excludes you from being complicit.  The only way to not have blood on your hands is to renounce your citizenship and leave.  All tax evasion means is that you have failed to contribute your fair share to the society whose protection and benefits you have enjoyed.

At the time of transaction, if the fair market value of the bitcoin was greater than the price you paid for it, you incurred a tax liability on the profit at the moment of transaction.  
  
But you are certainly capable of committing tax evasion.  People do it all the time.  You breaking tax laws isn't the same as bitcoin not being taxed.  It is taxed, and if the government ever finds out you violated the tax law, then there can be stiff fines and even imprisonment.

I still have my Novell text book around here somewhere.  I took a class in a small town and never bothered to take the certificate exams because they were so expensive.  I moved to New York, and got an office job as an assistant at a small recruiting agency.  They didn't have an assignment for me immediately, so I just answered phones for them until something came up.  The week I started, their whole network died.  I told them I could wipe everything and install a new Novell network within a couple of days.  I didn't charge them anything, just what they were already paying me.  They treated me like I was Jesus-fucking-Christ.  From then on, they placed me in great jobs that pretty much led directly to all the best opportunities I've had in my career.  
  
I may have not gotten the certification, but that Novell class hooked me up good.  Of course, a year later that knowledge was essentially obsolete, but I had just enough knowledge to be dangerous at just the right time in just the right situation.

It would mean that bitcoins are less scarce than was believed (if the coins never move they may as well not exist, so they decrease the total of available supply).  There would likely be a healthy decline in the price to account for the revised estimate of scarcity.  If he dumped them, than the coins would then be in play, and we could continue on with price finding without fear of such a thing happening again.  
  
To be honest, if he is ever going to move them, I'd prefer he do it sooner than later.  If he isn't, I'd love to see him just send them to a burn address.  This 'will he'/'won't he' business isn't great.

I know this is only tangentially related to Bitcoin, but I think that anything that is dealing with massive bank runs, capital controls, currency seizing and the like serves to illustrate the benefits of technology breakthroughs like Bitcoin over fiat money.  It's too late for Greece, but the example this sets for the rest of the world can help to raise consciousness and awareness of the pitfalls of debt-backed money and the potential solutions offered by cryptocurrencies.  
  
In this light, Greece remaining in the EU and getting another bailout with insufficient (and unlikely to succeed) reforms, kicks the inevitable can down the road for a few years.  If the IMF kills the deal by refusing to participate, which means Germany won't participate as IMF involvement was a condition of their participation, we may see this all unfold on an accelerated timeline by comparison.

I have little doubt that there will eventually be a Supreme Court case in which Bitcoin is argued as free speech.  It is essentially just lines of code, and that code is protected speech, just as lines of poetry would be.
  
While the IRS is claiming bitcoin as property, the criminal justice system is [declaring it money]( (when it suits them).  The government just takes the position of whatever is most beneficial to them in the context they are considering, with pretty much zero regard for the nature of the technology and the constitutional protections that emerge as a result of that nature.  From the bought-and-paid-for miserable excuse for a judge from the Ulbricht case:

I happen to find taxation, as a method to assure that those who partake in the benefits of society contribute to its functioning, is a reasonable social bargain.  I'm open to haggling about the percentages and the mechanisms though.  If I were to advocate the removal of any taxes, capital gains would be pretty low on the list of where I'd start.  
  
Personally I'd like to see way lower income taxes across the board on incomes under $100,000.  Ever increasingly higher taxes above that rate, wealth taxes for billionaires, and higher capital gains taxes on a scaling basis.  I'd like to see some of that giant money pooling at the top used towards seeing a basic income implemented and college education and healthcare offered free for those who cannot afford it (on a means-tested basis).  
  
Further, I'd like to see executive pay limited to a ratio of employee pay at any company above a certain size and an end to high-end tax loopholes for the rich.  The ultra-wealthy are being compensated far in excess of the value they offer to society, and the profits made possible by advances in productivity and efficiency are not being shared with the people who have made them possible.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:23:19

Palin was for the base, and McCain indeed did pull center.  He backed off of privatising social security and off-shore drilling.   He got on board with Everglades preservation.  He gave populist speeches in places like Michigan, backing off of tax cuts for the rich and his previous position of doubling-down on Bush economic policies.  
  
He definitely moved to the center.  If he'd picked a more center-right VP, he might have won.  Romney made a similar, but lesser mistake picking Ryan.

Without humans, nothing has value.  The very notion of value is a human construct.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:52:21
Not without humans to invent a concept of value and apply it, no, but no need to be overly semantic about it.  I'm fine to concede those things have utility to those living things, which we can call value if you prefer.  Rather than get into a debate of the nature of consciousness in animals (and plants for that matter) I'll go ahead and expand the definition to beyond humanity.  Nothing has inherent value, it is only in respect to living (I'd argue sentient, but let's keep it very broad) things.  Nothing has inherent value - the universe doesn't seem to care.  
  
It is not until you factor in the perspectives of living things and create a relation that value can be said to exist.  So, yes, in this sense, food and shelter are valuable to animals and people.  Gold however, isn't much value to animals, but it is to humans because we assign it value and find uses for it.  In this schema, there is no such thing as intrinsic value.  Things have value if we find them useful and have uses for them.  A distributed consensus network is something that humans have use for, therefore it is valuable in the same way gold would be.  For gold, you can make electronics.  For bitcoin, you can facilitate a global payment network and trust without a third party.  Both are useful - there is no special status that gold has that makes its value more intrinsic than bitcoin's.  
  
If society breaks down and computers can no longer run, it would have less value (none).  If society broke down further, gold would also have less value.  The whole notion of intrinsic value is nonsensical without such a relation, and therefore saying bitcoin has no intrinsic value is inaccurate unless you also concede that nothing else does either.

That applies to whether evidence is admissible.  Even if it is admissible, I'd at least think a compelling case for reasonable doubt could be made to a jury.  Bring in an expert witness to testify about how the chat logs could have been tampered with and placed on his machine without leaving a trace.  Combined with the crooked agents, it may be enough to convince a jury.  And if a jury is allowed to hear the argument, it may be enough to convince the state to offer a lesser plea.  I doubt Ulbricht will go free, but maybe he can parlay it into 8-10 instead of life or some such thing.

The Presidential race is a whole different animal.  But, to answer your question, they would start pulling to the center after they got the party nomination.

Looked at one way, the situation makes a case for Bitcoin.  Had Amazon accepted BTC as payment, there wouldn't be an associated credit card on file to charge.

I agree with your first paragraph but not your second.  If you realize a gain in any form, that is taxable.  I vastly prefer that the gain be considered a capital gain over it being taxed as income.  
  
We already have a big enough problem with the wealthy being taxed at a much lesser rate than the common person, because most of their gains are taxed at the capital gains rate while everyone else pays income tax rates on the majority of the revenue they bring in.  Eliminating capital gains tax, for bitcoin or any other asset, is not going to help income inequality and would be unfair.  It's arguably unfair now.    
  
If I had it my way they would reduce the income tax on everything under $100,000 to capital gains rates and cut military spending to cover the difference.

They are doing good work with the Bitcoin Center, so credit where it's due.  I don't mean to be overly critical and can't refute any of his claims. It's just a pure gut reaction.  The guy just does not come across as sophisticated or credible.

It's a little different.  They are saying that if I go to a store and buy a pair of jeans, giving $50 in bitcoin for them, the seller owes sales tax (which they charge the customer).  The buyer, yes, also owes capital gains if they initially purchased the bitcoins for a lower price.  This new wrinkle says that in the case of buying the jeans, the buyer owes sales tax to the vendor (who gives it to the state), capital gains tax, AND sales tax to the state as if he were also a seller in the transaction.  So the transaction looks like this and the buyer owes: 
  
Jeans: $50  
Sales Tax (buyer): $3.50  
Sales Tax 2 (seller): $3.50  
Capital Gains tax: X  
 
I'm fine with the capital gains part so I'll just exclude it, but this means the buyer who buys in Bitcoin must pay $57.00 while someone who uses USD would pay $53.50.  Buying anything in New Jersey with Bitcoin is now more expensive than buying it with cash.

I don't follow.  Whether you give the seller of the product Bitcoin or a colored asset, they are both considered property in the same way.  You are either trading the bitcoin or the colored asset for the product.  If the colored asset is worth x amount of btc which is worth $50 then the fair market value in USD of the colored asset is $50.  
  
Like kind only applies to the capital gains, not retail transactions.  And it is far from clear that the IRS would consider trading between different coins as 'like kind'.  The protocol differences may be enough to exclude it on the not meeting the required criteria of 'identical characteristics'.  Which is itself ridiculous given you can trade whole businesses under the like-kind loophole, which would argue for a broad definition of 'identical', but as far as I know the IRS hasn't issued guidance and every tax expert I've seen discuss the subject has said the best bet is to assume it does not apply.  
  
But at the end of the day it doesn't matter because it doesn't apply to sales tax.

You also incur the tax liability upon spending any of the bitcoin (assessed at the fair market value of the coins when you spend them).  Spending them is the same as selling them in the eyes of the IRS.

It certainly may be the case for alt coins, it seems reasonable to me, but I do not believe this has been clarified by the IRS and I haven't seen anyone say they tried it.  The regulations for like kind exchanges require the two property types to have the same 'rights, characteristics, and obligations'.  I guess it depends on how they define 'characteristics'.  If the past is any prologue, then they will define it in a way that screws the most people.   
  
It certainly doesn't apply in the case of a retail transaction made with Bitcoin though.

I loved [that scene](  The absurdity of calculating the shortest time it would take to jack-off a room full of men is funny enough, but the scene also did a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of computer science and taking a systems approach to problem solving.  No matter whether the problem set is a real or made-up situation to solve, the tools and intellectual approach remain the same.  The way they went from casual conversation to assigning variables and sketching out a rough system on the whiteboard was perfect.  
  
When you study computer science it kind of changes the way you think.  You find yourself summing up problems and trying to consider all possible contingencies, playing adversary to your own ideas and those of others to crystalize flawless solutions that cover all possible cases.  
  
It definitely reminded me of some of my best professors challenging us with random problems made up on the spot and breaking us into teams to solve.  I had one professor who claimed at the beginning of the semester that 'computer science can be about ANYTHING', and to prove it, he would let the class choose what the final project would be. 
  
The day we decided he asked us all for ideas.  I suggested a time-travel simulator.  Another popular idea was a Wookie-based space game where you would immerse yourself in Wookie society and gallivant about the universe.  Someone else suggested we remake an Oregon Trail type of game.   
  
Our final project?  'Time-Travelling Wookie Space Ships on the Oregon Trail'.  We were given a bunch of parameters - eras of time, locations, types of spacetime ships, ranks of Wookies, several time-travel drives (flux capacitor and Eye of Harmony were in there) with varying levels of failure rates, and events that could occur when you landed in a given era.  
  
In the end you could use a Delorian to try to send a Wookie to say World War II Germany and try to kill Hitler and accidentally end up on the early american frontier with a dysentery-riddled Wookie crew.  
  
Great class, great professor, and really opened my mind up to the possibilities made available by rigorous and thorough systems thinking.

Yes, if you paid more for the coins than they were worth when you sell them then you can deduct that amount from your capital gains for the year.  If you didn't gain at all in the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 in losses a year.  If the amount you lost is greater than $3,000, you can apply the difference in future tax years (but never more than $3,000 in any given year).  
  
Lying about it would be very risky.  If you got audited and couldn't prove proof of transaction you could get serious fines and even prison time.  The blockchain is a permanent, public record, so at the very least you should always be able to show the transactions on the chain.  If you use a service like Coinbase the IRS can subpoena their records and see exactly the cost at the time of purchase and spending.  
  
Your real only hope would be to mine or buy bitcoins with cash person-to-person, and then any coins you spend you'd have to buy things that don't tie your name/location to a specific Bitcoin address (ie by giving them shipping info).  In which case you are committing tax evasion and looking at prison time if you get caught.

Before DACs and smart contracts can reach their full potential we definitely need a robust oracle system with reputations.  I struggle to imagine what a decentralized version would look like and how you can balance the need for reputations with pseudo-anonymity.    
  
The best system I can imagine accomplishing that would work something like as follows:  
  
A distributed software client, let's call it Pythia, is downloaded and run by anyone who wants to be an oracle or call upon the results of existing oracles.  Distributed computing supplies the processing power to aggregate and record oracle performance.  
  
Pythia essentially has it's own blockchain which can hold questions ('Who won the Yankees game last night?') conditions and the like.  Each address is an oracle, and whomever has a key to that oracle can submit an answer to any questions/conditions submitted on the chain.  Timing and dates are programmed into the initial question.    Each oracle's reports are also recorded into the chain, as is their accuracy.  
  
Knowing how to rate the oracles (did they get it right or wrong?) is a function of wisdom of crowds.  The more oracles that report an outcome (Yankees won) the more that outcome calcifies in score and the blockchain comes to view it as a true outcome.  
  
Contract-makers are given a slew of options.  They can choose single oracles, an average of specific multiple oracles, and average of all oracles who weighed in, and weighted combos of all the above.  When setting the contract they can require that both parties approve the oracle-reported outcome or that a certain percentage of oracles reporting an outcome can over-ride the need for both parties to sign off.  
  
Oracles would gain reputation (for addresses in their control) by being correct, by being specifically requested to weigh in on questions/contracts, and for the amount of hours they contributed to the system.  The system, I suppose, would need to generate tokens as awards.  Ideally these would be bitcoins.  You'd pay for oracles with bitcoins and you'd get paid in bitcoins for being an oracle.  
   
Not sure if that part would work though.  It may need to be a token of its own that can be traded for bitcoin (much as I hate to generate *another* altcoin).  Oracles could receive minor amounts of tokens for being right on things they weighed in on but weren't invited, and more on contracts in which they were requested specifically.  
  
You could also set up 'burn addresses' tied to a specific API.  So an address that can be set up once to ping the ESPN API and then would forever deliver the results it reported (until ESPN changed their API).  In this way, you could have trusted addresses pulling from centrally-controlled sources.  If the sources die, the addresses become not useful.  If the sources modify, then new burn API addresses would need to be set up.  
  
I guess the part that I have trouble working out in my mind is how the bitcoins (or Pythia coins) are stored while a contract is undetermined.  Is it just an address with with a smart contract on it that needs two keys to create and then once implemented can never be changed?  It can only pay out or return funds if required thresholds aren't met.   
  
Without something like this, I just don't see how decentralized smart contracts can be all that useful.  They will always have to require a trusted 3rd party.  It would definitely be interesting though.  It would crystallize on a version of history, forever unchanged.  Probably end up with a massive chain eventually too, but people could run nodes that only have history going back so far.  People with more resources could run the full histories for posterity.  
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:05:00
I see a couple of issues.  Firstly, it's not clear that the IRS would consider a colored-coin and bitcoin like-kind assets.  They are fundamentally different in many ways.  Centralized/decentralized.  Different protocols.  Different code.  One is tied to a corporation the other can't be.  
  
Second, if the coin can be redeemed for $250 in bitcoin, then it's fair market value is not $.05, it is $250.  Also, if the user can freely transfer the colored assets than overnight there would be an external market for them out of control of the centralized corporation.  Who would sell something for five cents redeemable for $250 of bitcoin?  A centrally-controlled, non-transferable asset with a price dictated by a corporation is different enough in character to all but guarantee that like-kind doesn't apply.  
  
Finally, the vendor selling a $250 item for $.05 would incur income tax.  If you win a car or a boat on a game show 'for free', you owe taxes on the item at income rates for the fair market value.  If you receive an item for $.05 with a fair market value of $250 you'd owe 20-25% income tax (depending on your tax bracket) on the difference.  The buyer would be a bigger loser then in the double tax case.

Companies don't care about taking care of the meek, the impoverished, the oppressed, the abused, the hungry, the mentally ill, or anyone who is caught by social safety nets.  They exist only to maximize profits.  Private institutions are not capable of providing a socially safety net.  I'm not interested in a world where the weakest are allowed to starve and die and we do nothing to try and help other sentient human beings.  We don't all start with the same opportunities and advantages.  Things aren't equal.  Government is not a perfect mechanism, but it is far superior to what private institutions would offer.  Also worth noting that private institutions couldn't thrive and prosper without the security and societal stability that government provides.  The barbarians would be at their doors in no time.  
  
I'd argue that taxes are voluntary.  One is welcome to renounce their citizenship and try to make due in the world without the obligations required of citizens, but they must give up the protections and privileges afforded by the same.  
  
As for how to implement basic income, I think Marshall Brain offered the [best thinking]( I've come across on the matter.  The BI is funded by things like profits from natural resources, public advertising, fines, auctions, lotteries, copyright, extreme income taxes, national mutual funds, punitive damages, sin taxes, luxury taxes, etc.  
  
I'm all for regulating healthcare price controls.  It has worked pretty well for Japan, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany and France.  
  
We tell people what they can and cannot trade for the greater good.  Nuclear weapons at the extreme.  Just because people want to do something doesn't really matter.  We have to share this world and that means compromise and mutually beneficial societal agreements.  If the private sector was doing an efficient job of distributing the planet's wealth in a fair and just way, then it wouldn't be necessary.  But they aren't.  Income inequality is at an obscene level.  One's right to profit is only reasonable if it is a net gain for society.  Profit is not the end goal nor the highest ideal.  A world free from suffering and injustice is the goal.  To the extent that capitalist systems work towards that goal, they are preferable.  If instead they create a world filled with greed, stagnant wages, massive swaths of poverty and suffering, starvation, violence and oppression, then their 'rights', possible only because the mob chooses not to burn it all to the ground, must be checked and altered.  
  
Lower cost goods are useless if wages do not provide enough to acquire them anyway.  There is no reason for society to tolerate the current, worsening distribution of resources.  Keeping billions in poverty so that dozens can live lives of unimaginable lavishness is immoral and disgusting.  We've done just fine with the wealthiest being taxed as much as 90%.  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the top bracket income tax rate was over 90% and the economy, middle-class, and stock market boomed.  
  
There is nothing that billionaires contribute that is of sufficient value to society to justify the current state of affairs.  I really hope we can have a *peaceful evolution* to a state where resources are more reasonably shared across humanity, but if we don't, eventually, we will undoubtedly have a *violent revolution*.

The only way I can see it working is that they release a distributed coin that everyone can legit mine on day one.   This new coin, whether it be JPMorgan coin, or AdobeCoin, or AppleCoin, or SonyCoin, will allow you special discounts or afford certain guarantees when buying their goods or services.  Like paying with AppleCoins at Apple gets you 10% off of purchases (the purchasing power of the coin would be set by fair market value on exchanges).  So buying $100 worth of merchandise would cost $90 worth of AppleCoins.  Make sure the protocol has a hard cap on coin limit, and let the thing into the wild.  
  
People want the coins because they want the discount.  The coins are rare, so the price goes up.  Rather than minting more, Apple just keeps churning and churning the coins they are getting paid.  As the value goes up, they sell their coins on the open market, profit, and wait for them to return when more people buy Apple goods with them.

It's pseudo-anonymous.  The on-ramps and off ramps are transparent to prying government snoops, or you end up paying a premium.  Ultimately, there are 3 ways to get Bitcoin. 
  
1. Mine them.  Not likely to be a very profitable enterprise, but with enough time and money invested you could earn bitcoins anonymously for just power and an internet connection (after initial startup costs)  
  
2.  Buy them.  This is where they get you.  You are correct that this is a difficult and frustrating process.  That is not a weakness of the technology, there is no technical fault or lack.  It's entirely regulatory.  This power is how they will try to control the reigns, but this sucker is going to get away from them no matter how hard they try to control it.  
  
3.  Accept them for goods and services.  Earn them. I've always gotten my money in compensation for performing tasks.  What can you do?  How can you help people?   What are your skills worth?  Put it out there and find someone who will pay you bitcoin for your efforts or use a payroll service (though that is an onramp and subject to the whims of regulators).  It is no small thing that *contributing* is likely the easiest way to acquire bitcoin.  Build something or help someone and do it for that sweet BTC.
  
I mean, if this thing works out like we hope it will, eventually there won't be any need for onramps and offramps.  In the situation where you get paid to an anonymous address for services rendered, you can have complete anonymity (although the transaction is transparent to all).

But the seller charges the sales tax to the customer who ends up paying both of them.  For this transaction to make sense, the buyer of the product would have to charge the store sales tax for the bitcoins.

I love Mad Libs!    
  
Ok, so we need numbers.  Let's use random.org.  First go?  Oooh, [sweet roll](  98!  
  
We need another number but with a bigger range.  Let's go with 10 million as the potential top number.  That would put Bitcoin at about a 21 trillion market cap which is nearly a third of all the current wealth in the world.  Survey says?  836,515  We can work with that!
So for the next one we just plug in today's price, so ho-hum easy peasy fubreeze my neezy.  $269.  
  
For the multiplier simply divide our last two numbers for an oddly close to even 3500x.  
  
And back to random.org for your portfolio percentage.  Come on no wammies... 12.  Risky, but not totally insane.  
  
So in the end we have:  


  
There you have it folks.  Science says put 12% of your savings into Bitcoin.

How's that?  This is, all things considered, the best time in all of history to be alive.  For most of human history, lives have been solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.  Today, average life expectancies are at an all time high.  We also live in the most peaceful time in recorded history.  For most of human history, about 500 people out of every 100,000 died violently at the hands of other humans.  Today, that number is about 8.  
  
The amount of food available per person is at an all time high.  Population growth is slowing and looks to stabilize.  People are smarter then they have ever been (see the Flynn Effect).  Women are doing better then at any other time in history.  
  
Huge swaths of the world have a device in their pocket that provides them with instant global communications capability and access to the grand sum of human knowledge.  
  
There are more democracies then ever before, crime is down pretty much globally, literacy is at an all time high, child mortality, malaria, smoking, teen pregnancy, deaths in armed conflict - by pretty much any measure, the world is in the best shape it has ever been for humans.
  
That's not to say that we shouldn't strive to do even better, or that we have no problems, but if anything, life today is becoming more certain compared to the past.

Ha.  Reminds me of a story my uncle told me.  First time he got laid he was prank calling random numbers (this was back in the 70s), and one number he called had a woman answer the phone.  After she said hello he just asked:  
  
"Wanna ball?" (fuck, in the parlance of our times)
  
She responded:  
  
  
A couple days later they met, badaboom badabing got it done.  That woman?  Abraham Lincoln.

I've honestly come to believe that there are large swaths of people who do not know the difference between 'sell' and 'sale' as well as 'lose' and 'loose'.  With a typo or auto-correct I don't bother, but I correct these two because I feel I am often legitimately curing small cases of ignorance rather than correcting absent-minded errors.  
  
I figure I would want to know if I was legit using words incorrectly.

Holding significant cash reserves in the 10% to 20% range is a basic tenet of portfolio theory.  It is a beginner, rookie mistake to think you shouldn't hold a good percentage of your portfolio liquid.  
  
  
  
Cash serves many functions in any reasonable portfolio.

For some reason, massive swaths of people on the internet do not know the difference between 'lose' and 'loose'.  I've also noticed that the difference between 'sell' and 'sale' is a distinction that ridiculous numbers of people are unable to recognize.
