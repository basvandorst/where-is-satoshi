What he's saying is that Monero (currently) is the only coin that enforces fungibility by default. The sender, recipient and amount of each transaction are obscured, unlike Bitcoin (and every other blockchain-based cryptocurrency). Fungibility means one unit of currency is indistinguishable from another (no "coin history").
Some other crypto's such as Zcash and Dash *support* but do not *enforce* fully private transactions, so as a result almost no one uses them.

What I mean is that in any technical system, as complexity increases (usually by attempting to account for too many fringe use-cases), utility, simplicity, and more critically: maintainability decreases. As an example, TCP/IP is ugly, inefficient, and nowhere near as efficient as some other protocols that were competing with it back in the day. But it is good at what matters: being simple and reliable.

You really shouldn't do that, regardless how trustworthy they may seem. One mistake, one problem due to regulation, AML or KYC compliance, or any of hundreds of other potential issues, and your money is *gone*.
You would be wise to remove most of your coin from Bitreserve and stash it on something where *you* control the keys (wallet on your phone, Trezor, etc). Leave some "play money" in BR to see how it works out and get familiar with it, but only a fool would put most of their savings on a brand new and untested service. I can't tell you how many threads I've read where people lost all their BTC because they stored it on the latest "groundbreaking" service and then watched as it tanked, disappeared, got hacked, or was regulated out of existence.
It is good and fine to take risks, but only when there is an equal potential reward to balance the potential loss. Right now you're taking all the risk and gaining no potential equivalent reward. Be careful.

They *do* provide a valuable service! They essentially remove the 3-5 day wait time inherent in the ACH/wire system. I don't think it's far-fetched at all to envision a company starting up a similar business model relying on the blockchain.

Say you're watching the blockchain and you see a pending TX (transaction) with say a Transaction ID (TxID) of ABC12**3**. Well, you can grab a copy of it and re-broadcast the same transaction but slap a *new* TxID on it, say ABC12**4**,  and if yours gets accepted first it becomes the official transaction. The same money got sent and received as intended, it just had a different TxID. So, the sender spent their funds, and the receiver received their funds. A-OK, right? 
Not quite. See, the issue occurs with how Mt. Gox keeps track of their outgoing transactions. Because they use the TxID to uniquely identify a transaction they could be fooled into thinking the transaction never happened when actually it did. Thus they re-send some Bitcoin to the users account, and the user gets paid twice.
Is the the ability for a malicious actor to change the TxID of a pending transaction a *bug* with Bitcoin? Yes. Does it *break* Bitcoin? No. Regardless what the TxID is, the transaction still happens as intended (payer loses their money, receiver gains their money); there is no double-spend or anything like that. It's called "Transaction Malleability" and is so well-known it even has it's [own entry]( on the Bitcoin wiki.
In fact it's been a known glitch since 2011, and the workaround is simple: don't rely on the TxID to absolutely identify a transaction; instead use something like: `(Input Addresses + Receiving Address + Amount = unique transaction)`. This is what everyone *else* does. But because Mt. Gox is incompetent and implemented their transaction tracking mechanism in the exact way everyone says **not** to, this is the result: customers could abuse the withdrawal system to perform multiple unrecorded withdrawals. A side-lesson we can learn from this  is that "[Security by Obscurity]( (hoping people don't discover a known-flaw) is no security at all.
**TL;DR**: Mt. Gox implemented a faulty mechanism for identifying outgoing transactions, and as a result they were scammed out of a lot of Bitcoin. They were warned about their method for tracking transactions quite a while ago and ignored the warnings, and now they're reaping the consequences of their incompetence and trying to blame Bitcoin and the core dev team for it. Bitcoin is fine; Mt. Gox is not.

Okay I'm back.
Basically the design trend has shifted away from rounded corners and gradients and towards a "flatter" look. E.G. see the new Live.com email interface, or Gmail's interface, or even AOL's email interface. 
Here are some screenshots to illustrate:
[ESET NOD32 v5](
[ESET NOD32 v7]( (notice the trend starting towards flat/clean appearance)
[MSE (latest)]( (MS lags behind in design trend which you can see here, but it still is closer to the flat appearance rather than the "lots of gradient-colors-icons" appearance)
And now for comparison, look at [MBAM 2.x]( interface.
To illustrate why it could be perceived negatively, some interfaces from some of the fake AV programs that have been floating around for a long time for comparison:
[Fake AV 
[Fake AV 
[Fake AV 
Now of MBAM works *great*, and is free, so we can't really complain! This is really just nitpicking. But I think there's something to be said for the subconscious message a program's interface communicates, especially in the security community.
Basically, the fancier and flashier the interface looks, the less I instinctively trust it. My thought process being "if they spent so much time making it look pretty, how much time did they actually spend making it *work*?" or "It's so fancy looking it has to be fake." Some of the most powerful malware cleaning programs ([ComboFix]( [GMER]( [HiJack This]( [SmitfraudFix]( have the most minimal interfaces. In the security community a flashy interface with a lot of big icons is a giant red flag, while a simple, clean interface communicates the message that this program is serious and wants to get down to business, no unnecessary fluff getting in the way.
Now obviously MBAM works great otherwise we wouldn't all be using it, but there is *something* about it's interface that looks off, simply because it looks so similar to all those fake strains.

I personally have always preferred the lesser used B symbol with the single horizontal line through it, rather than the double vertical line one we usually see.

Exactly. Idealists may bootstrap a technology (e.g. the Internet), but ultimately it's the regular Joe's who end up using and running it, and reliance on them to be good is doomed to failure. The system must either *enforce* (FinCen) or *incentivize* (mining rewards) the right behavior for it to work in the long run. 
Think about things like the various places that have returned people's Bitcoin when it was mistakenly sent, or when all the miners agreed to a hard fork back 2012 which cost them money. A system built on the assumption of that kind of behavior cannot last, because that kind of behavior does not last.

That's a common misconception actually.
More copies exist of the "New Testament" manuscripts than exist of the writings of Caesar, Plato, Thucydides, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Homer (Illiad) *combined*, yet we accept them with significantly less scrutiny.
Original copies of NT writings: 24,000
Copies of *all* of the above manuscripts: 696
By and large differences between the texts are small spelling or grammar errors; there are no major doctrinal differences. All differences are footnoted as well (for example in Luke 23:34, "Some early manuscripts do not have this sentence." etc).
How to interpret the Bible is obviously up for debate (is it literal? allegorical? poetry?), but integrity of the text definitely isn't.

I'm sorry, but it is naive to think Bitcoin will "end war." 
The cause of war is not the financial system - the cause of war is MAN. Men have found ways to kill themselves before the USD/Euro/etc, and they will still find ways to kill each other even if Bitcoin becomes the only currency in existence.
Abuse of financial systems to fund war is not the CAUSE, it is the RESULT of human nature.

Targeting a faster block time is part of the solution, though not all of it. Litecoin targets a 2.5 minute block confirmation, which is much more tolerable than 10 minutes. 
Ultimately I think we'll see one of these two scenarios play out:
1. Bitcoin-core gets updates enabling a reduction in block confirmation time or an increase the TX rate limit
2. Litecoin (or something similar) gets adopted as the 'micro-payment currency' and batches of transactions are bundled into larger Bitcoin transactions at the end of the day/hour/whatever.

Look down the road further than 10 feet. In the hypothetical future, with a single mining pool processing *all* transactions, you lose the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and you're back to a single entity controlling everything. Even if they're benevolent, they're still a single point where the State can apply pressure to get them to act in certain ways (block this transaction, prioritize this transaction, etc).

Seriously, I don't understand all the groveling for PayPal to support Bitcoin. They're literally one of the worst financial services companies to do business with. I mean the worst.
Just think of the long and sordid history of PayPal and eBay. Gouging fees, arbitrary account freezes (which in some cases ruined the person's small business because it stopped their cash flow for too long), unhelpful customer service, and anti-competitive practices against other payment systems (Google Wallet, for example). Anyone who wants PayPal to get into the Bitcoin business is either insane, delusional, or *extremely* forgetful. 
I say let PayPal die in a fire, leaving the gap for a new company to "Phoenix" from the ashes.

The only issue with this is the giant can of worms making a change to the money supply opens. That's *exactly* the path fiat currencies *all* go down. "We'll just add a tiny, tiny amount of inflation to help cover these couple expenses" 150 years later turns into "we're printing so much money hand-over-fist we don't even know how much exists in the system."
I agree 100% that a tiny inflation rate makes sense; it's the giant shift in philosophy and acceptable practice it opens up that alarms me. Once you've made .01% inflation acceptable, who's to say we shouldn't make it .02%, or .1%, or 1.0%, or....?

I was referring to the textual faithfulness of the copies compared to the original texts, but you bring up a good point relating to a different type of accuracy - variations in first-person accounts (Luke vs. John etc).
This isn't really surprising though; we often see variations in first-person accounts of events even today. If you, me, and my buddy John all saw a mass shooting in a mall, we might all have a pretty good memory of the event but differ on some of the small details. (Which specific way did the shooter turn first? Did he take off his sunglasses before or after firing the first shots? etc) 
So in the gospels we have first-hand accounts of various events from different people, sometimes all were present for an event, and sometimes only one or two were. It doesn't really change the "big picture" view, and most of the details variations are inconsequential.

Something that helped me was to think of the *enormous* energy costs of maintaining our current system.
Some examples are: Printing huge amounts of paper-based money, shipping it around the country in heavy, gas-burning trucks, and paying armed security guards to do so. Or the current banking system, running massive banks with huge security costs (both physical and digital security), which requires electricity and man-hours. Or even if you think about gold, physically transporting and securing big, heavy blocks of metal is not an energy-waste-free enterprise. 
I don't know if the Bitcoin network consumes more or less resources than our current system, but my hunch is it's significantly less.

I remember in 2004 I was in Iraq on a remote FOB (Forward Operating Base), setting up a Tachyon satellite shot for some SF guys (Special Forces) so they could get online. As a return for the favor they let me use their satphone to call home. I sat down after finishing the setup and called my little sister at home in the midwest for about 30 minutes. It was great.
The memory of that day is burned in my brain (in a good way) because I suddenly had this sense of awe when I thought about the fact that here I was, in a desert in a warzone half-way around the world, sitting on a dirt mound in my combat gear, talking to my little sister sitting safe and happy in our house at home in the midwest of the USA, all because of this incredible insane communications chain that existed to connect my voice to hers. When you really stop and think about it, it is awe-inspiring and humbling. I bring it up because your comment reminded me of that day, and gave me the same sort of feeling. I could literally send *hundreds of thousands of dollars* to my family from a mobile phone in the middle of the desert, or a sat phone in the middle of the ocean, or via short-wave radio in the middle of the mountains, and it doesn't require any bank or institution to be open for business and processing payments that day or hour.
Scenarios like this are part of why I get so excited for the future of crypto-currencies.

A massive Reddit comment thread probably isn't the best place to go into this, but you're right - there's a lot of debate over how to interpret some verses in the Bible. But, at least in what you linked, there are quite a few out-of-context quotations which, when used in-context, prevent them from "saying" what they say there.
One example is Jesus talking to the rich man - he is testing him by saying, essentially, "OK, if you're so good, do this one last thing: go give up *everything you have* and follow me." He knows the man's heart and knows that, at least for this man, wealth is something he worships above all else. Jesus uses the question to expose his heart and real motives.
A second one is the one cited from Luke 19:8-9: in that instance what Zacchaeus was doing (giving away his goods and wealth) was a *response* to what had already happened in his heart (faith in Christ to save him); **not** as a means/"path" to salvation. Jesus responds by noting that salvation has come to his home; that is, he see's the change in him that is a *result* of his new found belief.

I think it's pride more than anything else. 
I have a buddy that I tried to convince to buy some Bitcoin back when it was much cheaper (~$80) and all the way through the big spike and back down. Now he finally says "I'll only buy if it hits $300" (an arbitrary random number). I tell him that'll never happen, but he's super stubborn. At this point I think it's just pride and the desire not to admit he was wrong.

That's true, but ignoring human nature or operating on hope that people *won't* act selfishly is doomed to failure. The system must account for selfish actors.

Or, to put it another way - it's no good sitting around bemoaning the fact that miners don't act in everyone's best interest, and hoping they decide to change their mind. The incentives have to work such that even bad actors will act for the good of the system, because it's in *their* best interest.

I can envision it functioning similar to the ACH today, of course much faster and more securely.
Essentially micro-transactions are 'batched' into larger monolithic transactions for processing on the blockchain. Say, all the 5 cent piece of gum transactions are bundled up at the end of the day into a single blockchain transaction.
Of course the ideal is still for micro-transactions with fast confirmation times to be widely deployed, but we may end up relying on an alt-chain for that (e.g. Litecoin or a derivative).

*[[x-post for relevance]](
Say you're watching the blockchain and you see a pending TX with say a Transaction ID (TxID) of ABC12**3**. Well, you can grab a copy of it and re-broadcast the same transaction but slap a *new* TxID on it, say ABC12**4**,  and if yours gets accepted first it becomes the official transaction. The same money got sent and received as intended, it just had a different TxID. So, the sender spent their funds, and the receiver received their funds. A-OK, right? 
Not quite. See, the issue occurs with how Mt. Gox keeps track of their outgoing transactions. Because they use the TxID to uniquely identify a transaction they could be fooled into thinking the transaction never happened when actually it did. Thus they re-send some Bitcoin to the users account, and the user gets paid twice.
Is the the ability for a malicious actor to change the TxID of a pending transaction a *bug* with Bitcoin? Yes. Does it *break* Bitcoin? No. Regardless what the TxID is, the transaction still happens as intended (payer loses their money, receiver gains their money); there is no double-spend or anything like that. It's called "Transaction Malleability" and is so well-known it even has it's [own entry]( on the Bitcoin wiki.
In fact it's been a known glitch since 2011, and the workaround is simple: don't rely on the TxID to absolutely identify a transaction; instead use something like: `(Input Addresses + Receiving Address + Amount = unique transaction)`. This is what everyone *else* does. But because Mt. Gox is incompetent and implemented their transaction tracking mechanism in the exact way everyone says **not** to, this is the result: customers could abuse the withdrawal system to perform multiple unrecorded withdrawals. A side-lesson we can learn from this  is that "[Security by Obscurity]( (hoping people don't discover a known-flaw) is no security at all.
**TL;DR**: Mt. Gox (and apparently SR2?) implemented a faulty mechanism for identifying outgoing transactions, and as a result they were scammed out of a lot of Bitcoin. Gox was warned about their method for tracking transactions quite a while ago and ignored the warnings, and now they're reaping the consequences of their incompetence

I'm sorry, you're simply incorrect. It isn't even a "Christian" thing or what stance I (or you or anybody else) take on *interpreting* the text; it's a simple real-life fact - there are [over 24,000 nearly identical copies]( (with inconsequential grammar or spelling errors) with barely 1% variation between them. That's not something I made up, and has zero to do with anybody's beliefs - we're talking about reliability of a collection of texts and whether or not they've changed from their original form.
You touched on some other common misconceptions as well, which I'll speak to here:
* The Bible was copied by people who were completely illiterate (untrue; the only people who *could* read and write in those days were well educated)
* The Bible has been re-translated over and over; incorrect, each new translation uses original sources; they're never a "Re-translation" of a previous work
* The Bible was modified after the fact. Again untrue; Biblical texts were literally copied *letter by letter* (sounds excruciating) by the Masoretes who, when they took over copying of the text, introduced the numbering system we still use today, for the purpose of ensuring they were creating exact copies (e.g. you could check your "verse 7" against the original "verse 7" and see they lined up correctly). The copies are extremely accurate representations of the originals. For example, between the 5,686 Greek copies (NT was written in Greek) and the roughly 21,000 copies in other languages, there is less than 1% variation in the text. That is insane! 
What we now call the "Bible" is in reality a collection of first-person account letters, poetry, historical genealogy recordings, etc, covering a wide range of literary genres and writing styles, and maintained with a high level of accuracy and faithfulness to the original writing. There's a lot of interesting reading about it, some [here]( [here]( [here]( and [here]( if you're interested.

@_date: 2014-02-13 15:11:25
First off I'll admit the paper was not as bad as OP's sensationalized/editorialized headline led me to believe. It wasn't a completely ignorant reaming of Bitcoin, but seemed fairly thoughtful and well-researched.
I do think however that a number of John Normand's points are fallacious because they're built on the logic of "it won't work because it's never happened" rather than a critical evaluation of the long-game potential. It's common for us as humans to relate new or unknown technology or trends to things we've previously experienced, because it provides familiarity and a mental "anchor" with which to compare against. However, while this often serves us well, in the case of truly disruptive technologies I think it limits us by locking our rationale in a historical box.
That being said, I've taken some statements Mr. Normand made which I think are fallacious and pointed them out below, along with some possible rebuttals:


The problem with this statement is that it's making an appeal to the "way things have always been." Essentially, "This hasn't happened before, so it won't happen." It overlooks the fact that no system like Bitcoin has ever even *existed*, and so there hasn't been an opportunity for the public *to* switch to a non-fiat local currency. Additionally, the fact that Bitcoin is taking off *despite* having no fiat backing is testament to how much of an improvement over current systems it stands to be. People are using it *in spite* of lack of government backing, not *because of*. That alone is very telling.
Moving on...


Here Mr. Normand expresses a common argument against Bitcoin's utility as a store of value, which is that it is too volatile to be considered seriously. And to a certain extent he's right - 120% volatility is far too extreme to hold any significant amount of capital. However, where I think he's mistaken (and he even admits this possibility at the end) is that he's cheating somewhat by comparing literally centuries-old money systems to a nascent, barely-out-of-the-womb, never-before-tried money system, and seems surprised that the new system would be volatile. Well, of course it's volatile! But, [like many speculate]( Bitcoin is merely going through it's initial growing pains prior to an S-Curve adoption phase, its volatility is just an initial annoyance that will fade with time.


While true, I would counter that it's even worse to have a central government recklessly debasing the national currency against the public will. The damage caused and corruption introduced by the "printed-at-will" system harms far more people than an irreversible Bitcoin theft between peers. In the latter, an individual or organization is out their money. In the former, and entire nation's worth of people are leeched of their value store. No system's perfect (no, not even Bitcoin), but I'd argue the Bitcoin system is a definite improvement over the national fiat system we see today.


I won't go into this one too much, suffice to say there are well-educated, intelligent people who hold differing views on how bad deflation actually is, or if it even *is* a bad thing. For transparencies sake, I fall into the "deflation is okay" camp, reasoning that while yes, you are incentivized to *save* money instead of spending it the second you get it (which might not be a bad thing given how badly broke our nation of debtors is), eventually you *do* have to spend it, regardless of what it might do tomorrow. Why? Because you have to live. You need food, electricity, and water, and you need to buy and sell goods and services. A deflationary currency simply encourages more prudent use of funds, and rewards savers. The argument about the economy "grinding to a halt" is nonsense, because people eventually  *have* to spend money, or they'll die. /endpersonalrant Again, intelligent people disagree on this so I won't go further into it, because it's a long-standing debate bigger than Bitcoin.
Overall I feel the paper was well-researched and thought out, and wasn't the Bitcoin assassination piece OP's title led me to believe. I think Mr. Normand bases some of his reasoning on faulty grounds, but he isn't completely off base. The fact that he knew what miners were and how they are rewarded shows that he didn't just slap the paper together. 
I've CC'd this post to Mr. Normand and will post back if he replies. Thanks for posting OP.

 - Bitcoin is like a giant Excel spreadsheet, with 21 million cells.

 - Everyone can see the cells being traded, but no one knows who owns the cells.

Not really. Sure, all the exchanges took a dip, but Gox (the ones who messed up) have been hit the hardest. And to say it "decimated" the value of Bitcoin (I'm assuming you meant destroyed) is a big stretch. It's still up *2,400%* over one year on competing exchange Bitstamp. That's hardly decimated.

You, like everyone else who argues that deflationary value transfer systems are bad, are missing a gigantic gaping hole in the argument, which is:
Eventually, at some point, you *will* spend the currency, regardless of whether its deflating or not. Why? Because you **have to spend money to live**. You *will* spend a currency regardless of what it's doing if it's the prevailing option, because you literally must. Additionally, if you can reasonably assume the currency will be worth 2x more the following year, the prudent investor might attempt to capitalize on that by investing it in other, higher-yield products (stocks, derivatives, etc).
Deflationary currencies worked well for the human race for hundreds of years (Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc). It is only recently Fiat currencies have come on the scene as the prevailing method of value transfer.
I could take the same anti-deflationary "logic," reverse it, and apply it to fiat currency:


I use quotes around the word "logic" to insult the argument and its assumptions, not you as a person. I hope you don't take offense to it.

I agree this sort of thing *can* be indicative of them doing things right (covering themselves legally), but there have been other exchanges that used KYC/AML as an excuse to cover up a meltdown happening behind the scenes, and Gox wasn't the only one. So people getting worried about it (I am one of them) doesn't seem irrational to me, it's just our brains doing pattern recognition. Once burned, twice shy as they say.

No, what I'm saying is the mining system must be organized such that it's in *my* best interests to act in the best interest of the majority. Not regulation - that's accomplishing something by force. I'm talking about incentive structures - engineering the system such that the correct behavior generates a greater reward than incorrect behavior. Basically the path of least resistance to profit is also the same path to greatest system benefit. That type of system is hard to design though.

Jesus was executed in what was essentially a mock trial.

Well, I don't know about how much energy the Bitcoin network will eventually consume, although I *do* know everyone is financially incentivized to build more and more energy-efficient mining hardware to reduce electricity costs, but I can't see how banks have a vested interest in reducing their "Carbon" footprint. The bottom line is what banks care about, and if they already operate at the lowest possible energy cost (because money spent on energy is money lost from the bottom line), I doubt they care about being any more "green" than the next guy.

This is a logical fallacy. The network won't die if mining payouts disappear, mining will just drop down to a level where it is profitable again for the remaining players.
If cost of mining goes up, miners will continue dropping out until the hashrate-to-payout ratio is barely profitable, at which point remaining miners will continue to mine.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:14:13
I think you *overestimate* money's role.
I've been in the Army for 12 years and spent two years in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, so yes, I do understand. Until you see war personally you'll never understand it comes from the heart of man, and you don't need money to kill each other. War is a human problem, not a monetary one.
@_date: 2015-08-08 21:58:21
What does that even mean??
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:17:18
Yeah it's very odd, I don't understand either. It's pretty obvious people will stop mining if it's profitable, and will keep dropping out until it gets back to a level where it *is* profitable again. I don't see how that's hard to understand, but I guess it is?

I love the insanity on reddit where everything is the governments/other people's fault and nothing is ever my fault.
Who accepted those loans? the Greeks.
Who lived a lifestyle far beyond their means? The Greeks.
Who is now reaping the consequences? The Greeks.
I feel zero sympathy. This is their fault and no one else's. They were stupid enough to keep running the country that way, and now they're going to get the cold, hard, mathematical results of those decisions.

The raving fanaticism and stupid claims that bitcoin will end war, fix poverty, etc. Additionally all the anti-government rhetoric. Most people are perfectly fine with government in their lives and prefer it over things like ancap. I personally want the government as small and neutered as possible, but that's not how most people think. And people in do not understand that.

Leaving everything bitcoin-related out, it was still a solid dramedy (drama/comedy) about coming-of-age and striving to escape from a rough upbringing.

Yeah it blocks all ads everywhere, but I prefer it over NS (for adblocking anyway) because it doesn't break a lot of sites the way NS does. Give it a shot, you might like it.

Exactly. There's some seriously delusional talk in about a currency *eliminating war*, poverty, and all other social ills. Really? Those things come from the heart of humans, and will *always* manifest in the world, regardless how clever the money issuance and transfer system is.

Hi Just want to say I appreciated your post, and although it's probably too late in the thread for you to see this,  you might try running [Tron](on your mom's computer. It's an open source project developed by the reddit community that's designed to clean up Windows systems automatically. It might save you some time vs reloading it.
Anyway, keep up the good work spreading knowledge of bitcoin. As they say, knowledge is power.
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:42:39
Ah gotcha, no sorry I don't know of a way.

It's a fake mockup for the movie. But he sells MDMA on Black Market Reloaded and it's clearly shown on the screen.
He also explains that if you use Tor, it's difficult to track the Bitcoin transactions, but once you link it to a bank account the possibility of being traced goes up. All in all pretty accurate.

I never understood this. Unless you *need* the trustless, distributed model of Bitcoin, it makes no sense to use blockchain model. It's simply terrible compared to modern database systems. *Waaaaay* slower, super inefficient, very costly energy-wise, etc. 
All those negative aspects are a necessity in order to achieve trustless consensus with integrity. But if you control all of the players/nodes in the network, you have no need for a blockchain.

Just print out the recovery seed (the long string of words used to recreate a wallet in case of loss), cross a couple words off the end, and give it to your family. 
Then, put those two additional words on a separate piece of paper and give them to a trusted friend, who will give them to your family in the event of your death. 
Benefit is that if the friend loses the last two words, it can still be brute forced. Downside is they could collude against you.
Or just use TimeLockVerify in the future when mainline support gets integrated. Or an m of n key, etc.

Not really, distributed database technology already exists (Google's databases, Netflixes, etc) and works great. In fact, much, much faster than Bitcoin's blockchain database.
The real value proposition of a blockchain *isn't* that it's distributed (we already have that), or that it's fast (it isn't, it's super slow), it's that *anyone* can use it and you don't have to trust *any* of the participants. All other designs require some degree of trust in the other actors in the system. The real value of a blockchain is as an open-access ledger that can be updated by anyone playing by the rules without requiring any nodes to trust any other nodes. In all other scenarios ("private" blockchain...why?) it doesn't make much sense to use it.

I feel compelled to say this having spent time in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan with the U.S. Army, as well as time in South Africa, el Salvador, and many other places doing missions and service work:
**Bitcoin will not "end war" because war comes from man's heart, not from technology.**
Yes, Bitcoin is great, but anyone who thinks it will "end the State" or "end war" is deluded. War springs from pride, jealousy, hate, etc and no "perfect technology," just like no "perfect law" will ever end those things. 
Now, can it make it more difficult to wage war? Sure, I guess. Can it enable better control over privacy? Sure, probably so. Can it change who people are and what drives them? Lets be real: probably not.
Stefan Molyneaux correctly identifies problems with our current world, government and money systems. Where he fails is coming to the conclusion that Bitcoin is the panacea to these problems.
If we want Bitcoin to actually succeed, lets focus on what it *really* is: A great money and value transfer system that *can*, when used correctly, enable better privacy and more liquid transfer of funds, and not try to make it something it's not: a silver bullet, end-all-be-all which will end world wars, stop poverty, and eliminate corrupt governments.
edit: only in could you make the statement that a software project won't literally END ALL WAR and get *downvoted* for it.

I have a feeling they need this exchange to do well, at least for public perception of their "brand." The Winklevoss twins are, at the moment, known for being smart but having no successes (outside of suing Mark Z., but which could be considered a loss since they didn't win rights to Facebook). Outside of the lawsuit against Facebook, I can't think of anything else they've done. Then on top of it BIT was able to launch sooner, as well as the Coinbase exchange. I really hope Gemini does well and is able to restore some credibility to the Winklevoss name.

You're simply incorrect with regards to Bill Gates. Though he personally doesn't work with it, he previously said "Bitcoin is a technological tour de force" and later went on to say "[Bitcoin technology is key](
You *are* correct about Warren Buffett dismissing Bitcoin, but the importance of that fact is lessened somewhat when we remember he's on record stating he only invests in things he understands, and has *always* avoided all things tech related. Bitcoin is no special exception to his long-standing tech aversion.

I think you're misreading my tone (and yes, I have achieved a number of things in my life). I have huge respect for the twins, and want them to succeed. But being born into money isn't personal success - it's random chance.
Achievement is about what you **do** with what you were born with. For the Winklevoss brothers, everyone in their peer group has money - it doesn't mean anything. The fact is they haven't had a big "win" despite their various efforts (again; being born into money isn't a personal "win", it's just random chance), but I think they will eventually, and I want them to succeed.
Success looks different for everyone, because everyone is dealt a different hand at birth. If you are born into a family of drug addicts and alcoholics but manage to grow up and work in rehab counseling for addicts only making a modest $50k salary your whole life, I say you have achieved success, because you vastly improved your life and the lives of others based on where you started. Likewise with the Winklevoss twins - they were born into wealth - that, by itself, is not success. It's what they **do** with that starting position in life that will determine whether or not the world will ultimately say "they achieved success."
So that's the train of thought behind my comment - it's not jealousy/rooting for their failure/etc or anything like that. I love seeing people succeed in all spheres of life, whether rich or poor.

Drinking hateraid is stupid and I say if you're rich, more power to you and good for you. I want them to succeed.
What I was getting at is that regardless of the wealth they were **born into** (again, I have no problem with that), and suing Zuckerberg regarding Facebook, if you remove the money and pedigree and you have two intelligent early-thirties guys who haven't had a big "win" to their name yet.

The Minidisc was/is technically superior to CD's in every way (physically smaller, holds more data, can re-record at live speed, etc) but never took off outside of a niche market (the recording industry) because by the time it launched, CD's were already so widespread and embedded that Minidisc didn't stand a chance.

One of his most glaring errors is the common "mining fees will skyrocket when there's no block subsidy" argument. When there's no block subsidy miners will drop out of the network (not making money), difficulty will drop substantially, and an equilibrium will be reached where mining has a slim profit margin (much like real-world mining).

Yeah, but in that case you don't need a blockchain, just a regular centralized or distributed database. The whole point of the blockchain is to allow you to store data in a distributed fashion, update that data, and do it without trusting any of the actors in the system. If you don't care about it being decentralized and open to anyone, there's no reason to use a blockchain.

I've had a pretty crummy experience with Circle. I accidentally bounced a payment to them (bought Bitcoin but didn't have enough in checking). Now my account is stuck in this limbo hell state where I can't deposit anything to bring the balance back to zero ("an error occurred"), and whenever I ask customer service about it they say my account is in "deposit-only mode" until I provide "identity verification documents" (which I've already done). Circle just plain sucks, I'm sorry. After trying repeatedly to resolve it I just went back to Coinbase and haven't looked back.

Yeah, same here. It's hard not to get obsessed with it, partly because the technical and social aspects are so fascinating, and partly because for a lot of "lay" people (like myself) it's the first time being exposed to suddenly making a pile of cash. This week I stopped looking at Bitcoin Wisdom, turned off the alert on my phone, and just focused on spending time with my family.
Money can make people weird. I learned that one day when working at the UMB Bank headquarters as a PC repair tech. I had to fix a computer down in the vault, so the guard escorted me down there to look at it. As I looked around I saw literal piles of money stacked everywhere, I think they said the vault was currently holding around 5 million dollars in cash. One of the money counters (an older lady) let me juggle two bundles of $20,000 each. 
I've never been a greedy person (I have other flaws, but greed isn't generally one of my big ones), and I don't really obsess over money, but standing there seeing that huge pile of money it was like something took over my brain, and I was overcome by a *strong* desire to grab as much as possible and run for it, consequences be damned. Up to that point in my life I'd never experienced that feeling before, a sort of temporary "money madness." I obviously didn't take the money and run, but the impulse was shockingly strong. 
The second time I experienced that feeling was when I first learned about Bitcoin, and it's been exacerbated with the price spikes lately.
Just remember, beyond covering basic life stuff, more money won't make you any happier whether you have piles of it or just enough. It's just a utility for exchanging goods and services, and while I think it's great to make extra money with Bitcoin or whatever, just remember people are way more important than some extra cash. 
I really like that often-misquoted verse in the Bible, the one people incorrectly think says "Money is the root of all evil." 
The verse is 1 Timothy 6:10 and it says:


**TL;DR**: Money is very powerful, and for many people who've never been dealt with large amounts of it, it can be startling how strong the draw is the first time they're exposed to it. Just remember what you already know: a) piles of money can not make you happy, and b) people are more important than money. Keeping those in mind, it's fine to work hard for money, or play around with Bitcoin, or whatever, as long as money is the *means* and not the *end.*

Focus on the strategic game rather than the tactical.
Edit: and for the downvotes for no reason, that means focus on the long game vs. the short game. A common newbie investor mistake is to lose heart after the first downturn and dump the holdings. I say this as someone who has made the same mistake. Stick to the fundamentals - buy low, sell high. Don't panic when it dives. It doesn't mean anything until you sell.

That's 100% dependent on how much money you have that you can afford to lose, and how much of *that* amount you'd be comfortable parting with. 
I'd say just buy whatever you can afford and see what happens with it. I personally spend 2% of my income to buy bitcoin each paycheck, but that's because if I lost 2% of my income I'd still be okay. I wouldn't spend any more than that though, because I have a very low risk tolerance. You may be different.

The problem with Bitcoin (and I say this as a miner and advocate of it) is that *eventually* the network will converge on a small operating block of people, probably using large ASIC farms. It has to - it's how the incentive system works out. It's an arms race to the most powerful farm, and those with the most capital to invest will push everyone else out. At that point it is no longer "decentralized" but controlled by a few (single?) powerful entities - those who could control the compute power.

Here's the big question I have: Where is Coinbase *getting* their Bitcoins? I mean when you buy a bitcoin from Coinbase, where do *they* get it from?

@_date: 2013-04-12 14:54:56
False. The site accessed was a freaking .info site, which is **obviously** not the official Mt. Gox website. It was OP's own fault for not checking what URL he was on. Additionally, it was pretty stupid on his part to follow a link in the ~~trollbox~~ chatbox.

@_date: 2013-05-14 23:22:48
Yeah, you can get it from Download.com [here]( just be careful to click the right link (the one that doesn't have the stupid "CNet installer" included).
I don't think you even need the MSI, I've been using it for a few years using only the .exe in a directory by itself. If it ends up not working out I can put it in my dropbox for you, just let me know. Obviously you'd want to scan it with A/V first, but it should work fine.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:21:57
Maybe do a 20/80 split? 20% in bitcoin, 80% in precious metals. That way if it all goes to crap you still have 80% of your capital, which isn't bad. And of course the contrary is applicable: if bitcoin really takes off, you could have a nice ROI.
Either way, depends on your risk tolerance.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:40:45
You buy in at this point with a significant risk of buying in right before a crash. It's not guaranteed but it is likely, so just be aware of that. 
And getting money out of exchanges is a bit difficult because you have to register and verify your account, which takes quite a while on Mt Gox because they're so backlogged with account verification requests.

At this point mining is a lost cause unless you are willing to throw significant capital at it to stay competitive. The difficulty is through the roof, so unless you have multiple ASIC's or a huge GPU farm, you will spend more in electricity than you'll make.

Well, obviously not, if you didn't notice an *obviously fake site* (the landing page looks very different from the official Mt. Gox) **and** you give the browser permission to let the Java app execute outside of the sandbox, *in spite of* [severe warning messages]( Dude, come on.

At this point mining is a losing game unless you're prepared to throw large amounts of money at equipment to temporarily stay ahead of everyone else.

Generally, when there's a financial crisis in any currency or region, other currencies/regions temporarily grow stronger as a result, mostly due to confidence being lost in the crisis region and a short-term panic to move out of it. I think *part of* Bitcoin's recent appreciation can be explained by the EU crisis. 
Look at the recent [Google Trends]( for "cyprus" and "bitcoin." Although this is a very, very imprecise measurement, it does give a general indication. Both skyrocketed at nearly the same time.
Additionally, check the "forecast" box and look at what Google predicts it to do.
I'm not saying they'll completely tank, but I do believe we're in a temporary bubble that will readjust. And if I'm wrong, well...even better!
Disclaimer: I have a very conservative personality (financially) and that trait does play into my view on Bitcoins. I tend to approach things like this with measured caution, vs. outright extreme optimism like I think killerstorm tends towards.

I can see why you're getting downvoted (cynical) but I somewhat agree with you - the money of chumps/"me-too!" investors *does* help fund the buildout of mining hardware. 
Satoshi himself said in a post that bitcoin needed *less* hype, and to fly under the radar for a while so it could slowly grow. Media hype and big influxes of eager speculators only hurts it's image as a legitimate payment system.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:50:27
Well when you're "mining" you're really just searching for a hash. It's trivial to search for two hashes at the same time, the GPU just checks the same input for two results. There's a slowdown, but it's microscopic and has little real world impact.

Use Dwolla.com. They're very reputable and you can transfer cash from them to your Mt. Gox account for a 25 cent fee (or zero fee if the amount is under $10). Granted, it takes 2-4 days to go through, but it does eventually go through.

@_date: 2013-04-21 14:45:37
Yes, you're pretty much correct. 
The only thing the introduction of ASIC's into the market does is reduce the size of the pool of people competing for the same fixed reward. So, you're competing for the same resources only now with a smaller group of people (those who paid for an ASIC(s)).
"Upgrade or be left behind" sort of thing.
Due to the way the Bitcoin reward system functions, it's an arms race to the most powerful mining farm, which will (eventually) result in all mining power being concentrated in a few huge pools, in the hands of those who could afford to upgrade more aggressively than anyone else. That *has* to be the end-game - it's what the reward system encourages.

One of the five common beginner investing mistakes is trying to time the market, or "wait for the next bottom." The problem is there is no way you can know if you're at the "bottom" or "top." You just have to take the plunge and accept the risk. 
Now of course, if there's a giant price run-up that's happening very fast, it would be unwise to buy-in at that point, but otherwise the advice stands.

I did a pooled order with a number of friends for some BFL miners, and after 6 months of not receiving them contacted BFL and requested a refund. They replied and said they couldn't issue a refund since the miners had already shipped (what are the odds of that...). So we said "well, alright, lets mine then."
Currently I'm running four of their ASICs ( and they're doing pretty well. I'm happy they ended up coming in, but in hindsight I still would've canceled the order and just used the money to buy some bitcoin.
At this point we'll probably break even, but they won't be wildly profitable by any stretch. Difficulty is just too high.
However, the most fun part of it is getting to send my friends money each week. It's kind of satisfying and my favorite part of having them :-)

I'll only speak to the aspect of usability, since I don't have enough experience or knowledge to speak to deflation or currency swings. 
I think the Internet used to be much harder to use back in the day (BBS's across modems, Usenet, etc), but over time it grew from a small core group of devoted "techies" to the global juggernaut it is today, with many services riding on it. I think bitcoin will follow the same path, of course presuming it doesn't fail for some other financial or technical reason.

This is what I did, and it's working pretty well for me:
1. Sign up for Mt. Gox and get the account verification process started, since it takes a week or two to get verified
2. Sign up for Dwolla.com
3. Link your Dwolla.com account to your checking account
4. Wait for Mt. Gox account verification
5. Once you have a verified Mt. Gox account, send money from your checking account --&gt; Dwolla --&gt; Mt. Gox, and purchase your coins
6. Withdraw your coins to a private wallet (I use the standard Bitcoin client)
7. Now you have Bitcoins
Alternate method:
1. Purchase some mining hardware
2. Start mining and gather a slow trickle of Bitcoins over time. 
Cons: big up front cost. Pros: after break even, it's all gravy from that point.

Another issue is any organization with tremendous resources. I work for a small company but even for us $30,000 is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of the budget. A large organization could easily scoop up 30, 40, 50 of BFL's 1.5 TH/s minirigs and fire them up.
It's roughly comparable to the ammunition shortage here in the States going on right now. The Department of Homeland Security (think: TSA at the airport) has purchased 1.5 *billion* rounds of ammunition, enough to supply a war for *twenty years*, and is just sitting on it. It's made it nearly impossible for regular people like myself to find ammunition anywhere. This is just an example to illustrate my point of organizations with a lot of resources having the ability far and above that of any individual or pool of individuals to affect supply of a desired resource.

Trying to time the market, or waiting for the next "bottom" or "top" is one of the five beginner investor mistakes. Why? Because there's absolutely no way of knowing where the "top" or "bottom" are. At some point you just have to accept the risk and take the plunge.

My concern is that right now Bitcoin is a tiny, tiny, blip on the financial radar (transaction amount-wise). If it were used heavily in worldwide commerce, blockchain growth *could* become a concern. Of course there are techniques to deal with this, such as "check points" where you cut off the first 50% of the chain and work from there, since it's a 'known-good' point. But there are definitely some scaleability problems, and I think made an excellent point regarding human linear thinking vs. exponential growth. Long-term, I mean truly *long-term* thinking is not common among people (e.g. see Government, United States, debt).

For the life of me I cannot understand why anyone would keep that quantity of Bitcoins in a freaking online exchange, when they're *so* new and routinely hacked. I mean...are you stupid? 
**KEEP YOUR COINS IN A LOCAL WALLET FILE!!!**
Until exchanges have *earned* a better track record and reputation with security, you'd be severely lacking in common sense to store anything more than a couple bitcoins there.
I don't mean to rub salt in OP's wound...just reminding people of the painful reality of online wallet hacks, and that we have to be to be **careful** in the "Wild West" days of bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't have *use* value, but it **absolutely** has *exchange* value. See [here](
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:49:01
In finance, you can think of Money and Currency. Sometimes Money and Currency are the same thing, but not always. 
**Money** is typically a store of value (think gold or silver) *and* has something called *"use value"*, which means it can be *used* for something else besides purchasing (think corn or grain, which you can eat, or gold, which you can make electronics with).
**Currency** can be a unit of exchange and thus have *exchange value*, which means it can be used to exchange for other goods and services. 
So *typically* (but not always):
 - **Money** has *use* value
 - **Currency** has *exchange* value
Now, speaking of Bitcoin as a *Currency* (and remember sometimes Money and Currency are one and the same, like with gold coins in Rome):
 Bitcoin as Currency
Currency can literally be *anything*, from stuff like bottle caps, cigarettes, and hard candy, to things like paper bills, coins, or notes.
All something needs, in order to be used as Currency, is the five required properties of Currency:
1. **Durability** (doesn't wear out very fast)
2. **Divisibility** (can be subdivided into smaller amounts)
3. **Limited Supply/Scarcity** (the more there is, the less it's valued)
4. **Transportability** (easily transported)
5. **Noncounterfeitability** (can't be easily duplicated/copied)
Bitcoin fulfills **all five** of the required traits to be considered Currency. It is:
1. Durable (numbers don't wear out)
2. Divisible (to 8 decimal places)
3. Limited Supply/Scarce (only 21 million may ever exist)
4. Transportable (with the click of a button you can send bitcoins to the other side of the planet)
5. Noncounterfeitable (based on public-key cryptography, you can't just 'copy-and-paste' more bitcoin into existence).
These reasons are part of why some people think Bitcoin has value as Currency. But that's not all! Turning to look at Bitcoin as Money:
 as Money:
For something to be used as money, it needs the three required properties of Money:
1. **Medium of Exchange** - can be compared against to determine the value of products or services during a purchase. Basically a "common ground" for determining value.
2. **Unit of Account** - allow us to assign values to various products and services and compare between them
3. **Store of Value** - maintain the value of a transaction over time. e.g. if you sell a car today, the money you get for it should be able to buy something of equal value 2 years later. 
Now Bitcoin *somewhat* has these characteristics:
1. Medium of Exchange - No party can arbitrarily increase the supply on a whim. Thus, the value cannot be negatively affected by a sudden increase in supply. Thus because there is always a "known" amount, it can be used to compare goods and services against.
2. Unit of Account - See above.
3. Store of Value - Bitcoin requires effort to create. Computer churn away for long periods of time to "mine" bitcoin. Electricity is expended, and hardware is purchased. Thus, Bitcoin acts (somewhat) as a store or "savings" of labor.
Now of course one of the biggest problems with Bitcoin being used as a Store of Value is the rapid value swings - this is bad because the car you buy one day may be worth millions of USD the next, or worth nothing, depending on the daily/hourly value of a Bitcoin. Proponents of bitcoin (myself included) hope that these swings smooth out over time as a bigger economy grows around it. But only time will tell.
**TL;DR**: Bitcoin possesses **all five** traits required to be used as Currency, and additionally at least somewhat possesses the traits required to be used as Money. This is why a lot of people ("lot" being relative, but I include myself in this) think it will and does have considerable value for use as both Money and Currency.
I hope this helps.

There's never a way to tell. One of the five common beginner mistakes in investing is trying to time the market. There's simply no sure way to know if you're at the "bottom" or the "top" (unless there's a massive price increase happening very fast, which is most definitely a bubble).

Well, keeping in mind that bitcoin is *very* risky (due to a number of factors), one of the five beginner investment mistakes is trying to time the market, or wait for the next "bottom" or "top." The problem is you have no way of knowing what the "bottom" or "top" is. At some point you just have to accept the risk and take the plunge.
Now obviously if a huge run-up in price is happening very, very fast, then it's a bad idea to buy-in because it's most likely a bubble, but otherwise the advice stands.

All ASICs do are slim the pool of people competing for the same fixed reward. 
"Upgrade or be left behind" sort of thing. I agree, it sucks for the casual miner. 
Due to the way the Bitcoin algorithm functions, it's an arms race to the most powerful mining farm, which will (eventually) result in all mining power being concentrated in a few huge pools. That has to be the end-game - that's what the reward system encourages.

Exactly. The vast majority of people desire to follow the rules of society (and the government). It's easy to be anti-government when you're young and don't have much at stake. It's much harder when you're well-established and in your mid-life and later years, where you have *significant* hard-earned gains to lose. Will a family man risk his family's financial well-being by bucking government financial regulation? The answer is no, he has too much to lose. He will obey the rules and play the game, because the potential cost to him is far too great. Everyone who advocates Bitcoin as an anti-government, "DGAF" currency is forgetting that while it may be revolutionary in the long-run, the overwhelming majority of the populace will NOT use it to fight the tax man.
If you've ever tried to fight the IRS, or the government in general, you will find that it *rarely* goes well for you. And when you are risk-averse (as is anyone out of their twenties and with a relatively stable job and/or family and/or house is), you'll see the "honey badger doesn't give a f***" attitude is in scarce supply.
It reminds me of the famous line originally said Daniel Defoe in 1726 and often attributed to Benjamin Franklin when he paraphrased it in 'The Works of Benjamin Franklin (1817)': "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."
The tax man *will* find a way to get his money. Anyone who says otherwise is either deluded or has not yet run into the heavy hand of the government when it targets an individual.

Sometimes crazy growth spurts from overexcited investors are good. The [Railway Mania]( in 1840's Britain ended up crashing hard, but it ended up being a net positive, because even though many company's went bankrupt, the rail system expanded *much* faster than it would have in a slow and organic growth model.

Just a friendly warning, (and I say this as a BTC investor and seller of mining contracts) - no currency behaves this way and remains stable. This is obviously a bubble influenced by the Eurozone crisis and some increased media coverage as of late, among other things. It must crash, as all hockey-stick graphs do. However, I expect it will stabilize around $30/BTC after the crash. Just don't panic when it happens. It's the normal cycle of a new monetary instrument, only happening 7 times faster than usual due to the instantaneous nature of the Internet.

Now of course, if there's a giant price run-up happening very fast, it would be unwise to buy-in at that point, but otherwise the advice stands.

It clicked for me at work when I realized I was telling coworkers I was holding something now worth thousands of dollars. It suddenly occurred to me "I shouldn't be talking about this." It's hard not to, because I get so excited talking about it, but more and more I realize its just better to say "I have a few" and talk more about bitcoin in general and less about my personal experience.

Please, please, PLEASE use the Ƀ symbol, as proposed by [Ecogex]( It conveys an entirely different feel that "breaks" from association with the U.S. Dollar.

Hey ZippityD, another thing to consider is that the Bitcoin network automatically makes it harder to profess transactions as more people do it. So after a while it sort of pushes out all the casual miners. I think the expectation is that the market will find the right balance of miners vs difficulty vs reward over time.

The same input isn't valid, it's just checking if it is. 
You're trying to find what the input was that produced a certain hash. In this example hash 'xyz' is the hash you're solving for the Bitcoin network, and hash 'abc' is the hash you're solving for the Namecoin network (I chose these two because they're commonly mined together) . 
Single mining looks like this:


In merged mining you simply check for two outputs instead of one.
So merged mining looks like this:


Now if the networks used different hash algorithms from each other then your hashrate would suffer, but since they're using the same algorithm it's trivial to check for two results instead of just one. 
Does that make sense?

I'm in my twenties, I'm part of this generation. You are not paying for my social security.


I don't know what you're talking about.


I agree with you 100%. Debt-based economies cannot succeed long-term. Savings is better than debt.


No, it's pretty accurate. I count myself as a member of this generation so I'm not excluded. It's just a trait of this generation (every generation has identifying traits, some good, some bad).


I guess you were directing this angry rant towards people from our parents generation, but I doubt any of them will read it on here.

So...I guess you don't understand hypothetical statements. 
**If** PayPal **decided** to *start* ....doing mining (to profit from the transaction fees, which is what they do now with Visa/Mastercard/etc)...they have the financial resources to purchase a large amount of mining hardware. 
This was a hypothetical forward-looking statement.

All they're trying to get is your private key, which allows you to spend the bitcoins in your account. 
If there are two copies of your private key, and one was encrypted with a weak password, and one with a strong one, it doesn't matter that there's a new copy with a stronger password, because there's still a copy of your private key that is protected by your older, weaker password. 
So an attacker will try to break the wallet file that is protected by a weak password rather than the strong one, because it ultimately accesses the same information (your private key).

Some standard investing advice applies to Bitcoin as well. One of the five beginner investor mistakes is trying to time the market, waiting for the next "low" or "high." Why is it a mistake? Because there is absolutely no way you can know where the "low" or "high" is. At some point you just have to accept the risk and take the plunge.

Can you link to said post? I'm unaware of any such "killswitch" in Bitcoin.

Usually there's a 4 day to 2 week delay after a bunch of news articles (e.g. the one about the $27 guy) before the price spikes, because it takes about that long for new people to read about it, sign up, get verified, transfer money, and start buying. So I'd look for a spike (and associated subsequent drop) sometime next week.

If they ask follow-up questions (most people never ask what you just did) it's easy to expand on it:
`When all the coins have been "mined," miners are paid a small fee for each transaction they process. The more transactions they process, the more fees they are paid.`

I don't think smart men who are worth billions of dollars are afraid of an Internet currency that's only been in existence for 4 years. 
More likely they just view it as another "dot-com" style fad. And to be fair, they have good reason to: the history of digital currencies isn't exactly ripe with tales of success. The only thing that will change their mind is Bitcoin proving itself, over time, to be stable and reliable. Then we might see the big guns of the finance world throw their (hard earned) weight behind it. 
Full disclosure: I'm a Bitcoin miner and trader.

We may just be seeing the turbulent waters of a new technology coming into it's own. I expect we'll see the price stabilize over the long term. In terms of % change, each boom/bust cycle has been smaller than the last. Fire up  and switch the graph to Log Scale to see what I mean.

I think the fact that the tumbler worked is possibly one of the biggest pieces of news being overlooked here. That's huge.
