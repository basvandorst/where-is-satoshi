Etherium and Dash
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:31:20
Why is that?  Does that mean that the only real safe place is a wallet?
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:30:35
Yes. There are several possible factors that can lead to that.
More issues from the Chinese regulators.
The ETF not being approved.
Continuation of massive back logs in transactions forcing higher transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:21:31
How does this shift how miners would operate?
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:41:17
I thought about that when it had a sudden rise to close to $1,100.
@_date: 2017-02-10 04:29:14
The scary thing is that if you have Bitcoins in China, your going to have a hard time getting your money back unless you leave the country with your hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:04:49
It could be announced at any moment by the SEC.
People have actually created programs to check every 90 seconds.
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:07:15
Usually, BTC has large days (3%+) ETH usually goes down and vice versa.  Like today.  I personally like the future of ETH over bitcoin because of the other alt currencies that are using the ETH platform and their future move to Casper and staking (which will take supply away).
However, I do hooodl Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:10:23
It will go up as people will use it to protect their money. Just like in Greece and other countries. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:54:49
I took the course on   They have an affiliate program as well.  Additionally, i listened to their daily youtube show.  They went over all of the basics and he has a very good grasp on how to each new people.
I also listened to Crypt0 as well daily. He is very informational about the alt-currencies.
@_date: 2017-02-25 09:25:01
What a keeper!
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:13:16
As long as they keep their bitcoin in wallets and trade it on other exchanges, can they stop it? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 02:34:06
Scam. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:39:14
Who are you trying to purchase through that it is giving you such a problem?
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:28:11
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:11:52
Thanks!  That was very helpful!
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:28:54
A switch to PoS would do it.
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:02:57
Coinbase is $5,000 a week unless your a new user. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:59:47
For news, I use Coindesk. 
For pricing, I use CoinCap.
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:41:27
Do you the first one to scale would become the "gold" cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:57:53
BTW, I did spend quite a bit of time trying to find information on Reddit and just general searching and these were the best for someone who doesn't have extensive knowledge about cryptocurrencies and how they work.  Other sites were either trying to get you to pump and dump small currencies or was way to technical for me to understand. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:09:18
Every crisis so far has given Bitcoin a bump.
@_date: 2017-02-10 04:31:24
We need to see what PBoC does. They could confiscate and kill the cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:09:19
It's limited ability to complete all transaction in a block which makes transactions more expensive and longer to fulfill.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:06:11
Yea that is crazy when you take into account there should only be a fixed amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:08:15
Lol, that's a bad coincidence 
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:11:05
Yes, but it is risky.
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:10:16
Wasn't that the month of the super bowl? The most betted day of the year? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:55:00
4 day weekend :-)
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:57:08
I would check with the press release on your wallet about it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:45:10
Yea, they normally always wait to the last minute.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:04:41
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:49:20
It was my deposit address for another crypto and is has never had any deposits or retrievals before.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:58:40
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:13:33
It's definitely an interesting time to be a miner
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:56:19
....still plan to do the same thing in celebration, now it can be 3 days.
No work for me Monday
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:06:07
This is the perfect way to describe what is going on
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:11:44
The ETF...
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:12:42
This is amazing!
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:11:22
Is the Core team working on a soft fork to adjust this?
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:30:39
If bitcoin etf doesn't get approved, it's not like it's going to drop down to $250 again.
If it's approved, there is going to be a sudden and massive spike in BTC purchases.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:00:16
Is that how it works? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:40:03
If you register your information, you can deposit dollars and then purchase your bitcoin almost instantaneously. That's what I do.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:03:14
Diversify but the longer you wait the higher your transaction fees and wait time will be with this volume. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:01:28
Good luck trying to shut things down on the internet when you have a " laid patent".
Edit: valid patent
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:14:08
I was just thinking about that. I would think that it leads to further speculation that cryptocurrencies can be manipulated easier than most assets. 
Furthermore, how the altcoins can be as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:09:05
Any of the US Exchanges will require the same. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:52:51
People are talking about it but I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:01:28
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:47:51
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:27:07
It's sad the number of time today...
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:30:59
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:09:02
How much. I want to buy this
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:58:57
I withdrew almost all my coins except for my FCT and SDC coins. Too much volatility for me. I am just here for the ride. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:05:03
I have a feeling that someone put in a large order and it triggered a lot of buy orders at specific prices.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:00:03
This is one of those days I prefer not to. Lol
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:10:48
How would that happen?
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:56:52
Burn addresses?
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:09:13
Only thing that could make it better was if I was at the beach watching it all unfold!
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:27:36
Because it has been asked 1 million times
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:04:05
Lololol 
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:38:33
Don't you wish you invested $1,000 instead.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:53:52
The cloud!
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:33:03
It had me register my address.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:25:04
I really liked Cryptoversity.
Also, I listen to their daily YouTube channel and also CryptO
That's a zero not a o.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:00:26
I have been on pins and needles waiting or this
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:01:23
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:49:49
Some news sources say tomorrow we will get a decision but they have until Monday.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:59:23
The drama free life!
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:24:26
Passed them on what?
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:46:26
I edited it. I meant the ETF 
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:51:38
I think we will see a decline across the all cryptocurrencies. I just think Bitcoin will decline on average more than the other major altcoins.
I think alt coins like ZClassic and the other small ones will be decimated.
I just hope it does get approved.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:41:29
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:43:40
But that's paper gold, not physical.
The price of the ETF is going to be based on its physical holdings of Bitcoin, which they must rebalance daily, making transaction costs and the inability of instant (or almost instant) transactions a challenge
Especially if it becomes a billion dollar ETF.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:10:08
I submitted a ticket and followed up and still no response. They say it's due to high volume...
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:56:05
Why would you not put it into a wallet?
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:20:22
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:24:56
To the moon! Imagine if it had some good news!
Careful of FOMO though!
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:47:25
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:41:49
All into Bitcoin and then lend it out.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:01:40
Haha that's amazing
@_date: 2017-04-13 03:33:04
What would it be paying?
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:42:12
@_date: 2017-04-23 20:57:11
Roger Ver says he's not concerned about it... lol
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:56:07
It was down to 60% a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:57:45
How do I help this? I am sick of the miners holding up Bitcoin. Let's show Bitcoin though LTC that it can work.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:13:05
Don't forget miner strikes for fair wages...
@_date: 2017-04-05 00:52:00
Looks like it.  It is u 30% today on the news.
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:57:21
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:27:56
He recently said people were DDoS'ing BU nodes. Keep it going
@_date: 2017-04-13 03:39:38
Isn't it paying out money?
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:14:58
You need to buy into USD.
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:34:45
The Cryptoverse 
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:12:09
Dude that is amazing. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:31:58
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:53:05
Look at litecoin
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:52:45
Yea, that and he anti-terror laws make it converting to and from fiat challenging 
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:03:39
He dream
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:21:43
It literally is the Wild West! You miss a weekend of news and you could be wiped out.
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:22:04
I prefer Poloneix 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:09:36
I haven't heard anything but positive reviews about Slush.
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:51:21
Most exchanges are like this while they are scaling. Doesn't matter if it is Polo, Coinbase, etc.
