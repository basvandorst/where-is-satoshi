your welcome..If you need to explain it to someone quickly, who won't hate you afterward. :O)
Think of it this way...
Internet Email replaced the post office
Internet Google replaced Libraries
Bitcoin is the first "Internet unit/asset of trust exchange" for ANYTHING we want to trade/buy from each other, or assign value to, and it is owned by all of mankind equally and potentially, has more power, then the internet itself, to change the lives of average people in a very positive way.

for me I really believe this will be back to $1400 b4 you know it and could get to $10,000 or $100,000 or even higher.. Just ask the programmer,  Laszlo Hanyecz, who first bought the first item for 10,000 btc.. a piece of pizza, that's worth $6.5 million today... a penny way back then (2010 lol) would get you  a 1,000 BTC..  I've got lots of LTC at a buck and BTC at $8 and I will never let them go.

if bitcoin replaces all currency in all countries, which it can do, once exchanges open that trade btc for gold/silver/commodities and no longer any fiat currencies, then a lot of magical things will happen....
One day (hopefully soon) , when a hard working person in Somalia ( or name impoverished country here ) receives the same pay as as anyone else in the world, doing the exact same job he/she is doing and then can take what he/she made and buy some rice at the same price ( all shipping handling for entire world is  priced in ) with that same universal currency/asset he/she earned there will be no more  poverty anywhere.
This will also give bitcoins/Litecoins value and gold/silver/commodities liquidity and bypass all fiat currencies in the world taking away power from the top 85 families on the planet that have the same assets as the bottom 3.5 billion people. ( and 10's of thousands of others ripping people off everywhere)
This also solves the problem of not much liquidity for the easy transfer and payment using actual pieces of gold/ silver / commodities over the internet .....
 now their value is transferable to btc/ltc, which is easily exchanged anywhere for everything starting with the most important thing wages for employment.
The way to move the whole thing forward is a worldwide UMX exchange and hundreds of local smaller ones, (2 companies are even developing cheap satellite coms for bitcoin servers ) for gold and silver weights and commodities , not US dollars, CDN dollars, or any other dollars, to be exchanged/traded for btc/ltc.
You can use small shops everywhere, in small communities, in every country in the world, like a current cash shop, pawn broker, grocer or gold/jewelry dealer that fronts all of the small trading for everyone. So you give them some gold or silver commodities etc and they give you btc/ltc or you give them btc/ltc and they give you gold silver commodities based on current gold/btc exchange rates on the UMX..
All 3 things cant be touched by megalomaniacs and are outside of "world money regulation/phantom creation" BTC and even LTC is the same as precious metals in many ways, it has a finite amount available over time, cannot be "printed" into oblivion, must be mined and is a store of wealth and no one individual or group owns the system, it belongs to everyone.
The numbers make sense..if you look at fractional bitcoin system the numbers more then make sense... each btc can be broken down to units that equal .00000001 so There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible units in the total maximum bitcoin design. The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. There is only around an actual 1 trillion in printed usd $ around and currently 60+ trillion in total US debt  (not including unfunded liabilities ) So there is, or will be by the year 2140 (end of bitcoin mining), 2000 times more exchangeable bitcoin units then us$ in the world and then there are no more BTC.
Mbtc (1/1000 of a BTC has already shown up on hundreds of sites, including redit where people are tipping others for good ideas, music etc. via phones or comps...
As more gold mined down the road it will just change the exchange value slightly ..but,unlike "make believe" money, (only .52% of the Bank of Canada's money is real, 1.75%in at the Fed and the average is .75% in all the central European banks ) .....both gold/silver and bitcoins/silver/commodities have physical limits on total in existence and are very real.

I sold BTC on Ebay as the only powerseller for 1.5 years and cleared $40k. I lost $5k of that to paypal charge backs because paypal enables and promotes the theft of BTC on Ebay, by ALWAYS allowing the buyer to win in chargeback cases.... believe me I tried at senior levels at ebay and paypal to get this corrected but no luck, finally switched to using online skrill payments through Ebay... chargebacks dropped to nothing.. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:02:24
I started with $40k in that account  and was very happy to find out it  traded quite cleanly, from a technical point of view, a very big market,  actually way better then ANY other exchange index at the same time ( nyse , NASDAQ or CME futures contract.  ) which were all getting really killed by front end BS , high frequency trading (skimming ) quote stuffing etc , That was also , of course,  b4 every central bank on the planet started trying to devalue their currencies in 2008 and 700 trillion in world wide derivative, swaps etc contracts were created and hidden ( no public market )  between them all of them and big hedgies, JPM Goldman and the gangsters, started floating around. Central governments change accounting rules to hide capital loss at every big bank in the world etc etc etc . Not only Can't you trade the shit now, soon I believe it will all be gone ... :O)

Here's how you fix that..a new universal exchange must marry BTC/LTC ( which is really a form of an asset not a currency or money ) with gold/silver/commodities
What many people really don't get yet is Bitcoin/Litecoin are the worlds first, very liquid, average persons, commodity/asset of exchange, that doesn't need any governments or banks to exist Here is how the whole game will change...by making Bitcoin/Litecoin very real, which will lead to a grand new world reserve liquid trading commodity vehicle (not currency ) ... and eliminate ALL potential regulation problems with bitcoin/Litecoin being equated to one, or any fiat government currency!!!!!
The real relationship between Gold/Silver/Commodities and Bitcoins/Litecoins needs to be a marriage!
This will give bitcoins/Litecoins value and gold/silver/commodities liquidity and bypass all fiat currencies in the world taking away power from the top 85 families on the planet that have the same assets as the bottom 3.5 billion people. ( and 10's of thousands of others ripping people off everywhere)
This also solves the problem of not much liquidity for the easy transfer and payment using actual pieces of gold/ silver / commodities over the internet ..... now their value is transferable to btc/ltc, which is easily exchanged anywhere for everything starting with the most important thing wages for employment. All regular people all over the world get paid at a world rate and buy food etc at a world rate and not an artificial slave rate dictated by some dictator country leader who is skimming off the top. 
The way to move the whole thing forward is a UMX exchange, like mtgox.com, but much bigger, only for gold and silver weights and commodities , not US$ CDN$ or any other dollars, to be exchanged/traded for btc/ltc/commodities.
You can use small shops everywhere, in small communities, in every country in the world, like a current cash shop, pawn broker, grocer or gold/jewelry dealer that fronts all of the small trading for everyone. So you give them some gold or silver commodities etc and they give you btc/ltc or you give them btc/ltc and they give you gold silver commodities based on current gold/btc exchange rates on the UMX..

I was selling from Sept 2012 to October 2013 and had no probs,, except paypal chargebacks where paypal actually enabled scammers by never finding in favour of a seller , I took that one to the top at both ebay and paypal with no luck , once i changed to skrill chargebacks dropped right off.. I had powerseller status (only one on Ebay selling BTC with that designation ) do way better trading them now , when i have the time, but at 62 im out, spending more time scuba diving, motorcycle riding and gold prospecting here on Vancouver Island in Canada, where I live :O) I understand Ebay Britian is now allowing sales on the classified site and the u.s. may follow..

Two big Las Vegas hotels accept Bitcoin.
Congressman Steve Stockman (R-Texas) accepts Bitcoin for 2014 campaign contributions. As
does a law firm in Australia and one in New York City.
Reuters notes:
    Already, 21,000 merchants are using Coinbase to accept Bitcoin from customers.
Indeed, there are websites listing scores of businesses which now accept bitcoin.
(And you can use Bitcoin at Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Crate &amp; Barrel, Target, Sears, CVS,
Hyatt Hotels, Kohl’s, Burger King, Applebees, Victoria’s Secret, Land’s End, Facebook,
Groupon, Banana Republic, the Gap, AMC and Fandango movie theaters, Whole Foods, Wine.com,
Wine Enthusiast, Papa John’s, Nike, Adidas, Sephora, Sports Authority, Staples, Zales
jewelry, Game Stop, FTD flowers, Zappos and hundreds of other stores if you use Bitcoin to
buy gift cards at Gyft.)
Andy Haldane – Executive Director for Financial Stability at the Bank of England –
believes that peer-to-peer internet technology will lead to the break up of the big banks.
Bank of America said “We believe Bitcoin could become a major means of payment for e-
commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money-transfer providers”
Visa has attacked Bitcoin as being less trustworthy than its well-established payment
So it sounds like Bitcoin is shaking up the status quo …
Backed by … the Big Banks?
On the other hand, a lot of major mainstream players are backing Bitcoin and other digital
payment systems.
Wells Fargo wants to get into Bitcoin in a big way.
JP Morgan Chase has filed a patent for a Bitcoin-like payment system. And Russia’s largest
bank is working on a Bitcoin alternative as well.
Ben Bernanke and the Department of Justice have both cautiously blessed Bitcoin.

you are completely normal, 99.99% of people lose money trading, (ANYTHING, not just bitcoin) I have been a trader since 1978, online trading since 1996 and have seen it all.
Some simple rules
1) no more then 10% of your capital in anything, causes less panic
2) Continue to believe in what you bought for the same reason you bought it.. but set stop losses. Ie 10% loss get  out
3) If you want to trade do it on a longer term basis over weeks never day trade until you have many years experience and technical setups you know how  to use.
4) Use technical setups you can learn and are comfortable with ....for btc this is the best place 
Im using an ema of 5  and 8 and a stoch/rsi of 28 28 6 6 which shows me a daily time frame on a 3 month chart, nice and easy..
5) Right now, with BTC, you are trading against rookie carbon based life forms, unlike the big markets where is is all computers and HFT trading, so fear and greed are motivating most traders.. Im currently  making a KILLING  trading BTC and LTC (against guys like you , sorry ) ... haven't had this much easy fun since shorting into the tech bust of 2000 :O)
hope that helps you move in the right direction...enjoy
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:03:08
yeah but that loss is predicated by how far back you bought it, price/volume movement from then and the action meeting or not meeting your expectations, I have seen way to many people hang onto shit way too long ( including my self and lose a ton of loot. Make rules follow them if your wrong admit and get out, if you don't do that you will NEVER be able to make money trading anything.

actually BTC is locked in at 8 decimal points forever so when the final one is mined in the year 2140 there will be 21 million of them.. each btc can be broken down to units that equal .00000001 at the max so There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible units in the total maximum bitcoin design. The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. there is only around an actual 1.6 trillion in printed usd around and currently and 60 trillion in debt 
so there is or will be by 2140, 2000 times more exchangeable bitcoin units then usd and then there are no more...Mbits have turned up already and 1/1000 of a bitcoin and are used for small transactions and tipping on websites. 
Once exchanges open that trade BTC/LTC to Gold/Silver/commodities, all of which are real. .. this will make it possible  that...

Im very excited by your success, keep up the great work.. you have good instincts buddy.. Im 62 and been accumulating and trading/  dealing btc since they were at $8 bucks. Was the only BTC powerseller on Ebay for a year and cleared $40k, ( lost $5k of that to paypal scams but switched to skrill ) thought I was really smart buying at $8 and selling .15 of BTC's to net $50 bucks each. Turns out that was really stupid ... lol

I've made several hundred thousand real dollars in forex trading , but market is absolutely f'd up now and has been since 2008, I wouldn't ever consider trading there again. I was trading online from 2004 to 2007 when the trading volume went from 1.9 trillion to $3 trillion using Interactive Brokers.. Wild wild west man .. lots of fun

Russia banned it last week.. My main exchange, I have used for over a year, in Russia, btc-e.com is up and running and everyone there says the ban is a joke. Also  still shows a dozen or more places still open to accept it in Russia. It is like all other good things for common people the psychos don't like cause they loose power. Well this time they can't do anything about it.. Remember the music business on the internet???...same thing.. only way better because it is a complete trust system that no one owns.

setup works good for forex currency pairs and futures contracts like the e-mini.. on a weekly / monthly  time frame, not so sure how the tea leaf thing would work for you in those markets, but hey whatever works for anybody is ok by me ... all the power to you buddy
