Premium would have to be 10x but there should be an option to do this.

I thought Allaire was one of the grown ups, seems I was wrong, circle really isn't a bitcoin company after all. :(

The prority is no longer security. Over time the level of security will be eroded as more and more convenience is required. It's a classic thin end of the wedge decision.
Imagine if a gold vault started adding a secret amount of aluminium to there gold bullion because moving real gold around was just too heavy. Would you still buy their gold bars?

Do not waste your time talking to manager/HR, this is not kindergarten!

All that we need is one large pool/miner to come to their senses and we can get back to bitcoin.

But capacity is now more important to the "community" so it's time to move on.

People will need a store of value that can interact with bitcoin.

The whole coinbase fud feels like a witch hunt.... it's very ugly and ultimately damages bitcoin.
Thank you for your thoughtful and level headed posts.

No, just buying and sell with euros so far. Instant buy is very convenient.

What is the simplest website that could make this happen?
Would some one like Xapo be able to offer this service?
also could it be extended to Netflix?

Are you paying a fix fee for your euro purchases?

But if I sell my btc then I would no longer be exposed to btc. If I could use it as collateral then I could have some cash but still popential see a return on my btc.
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:48:16
Sour grapes?
@_date: 2016-05-13 21:42:59
I'm thinking the btc collateral could be held in a 2 of 2 address until repayments are made.
Scamming would still be a problem to it method could reduce the incentive. Mostly it would the possibility of the btc being held for randsome. 
Of course it may be a better to sell some bitcoin and move other bitcoin to an exchange with margin to maintain ones exposure to btc while still have access to some of the cash value.

Blocks happen roughly every 10min.  Each block is one confirmation.
Any minute now you will see the 6 confirmation and you're good to go.

Tough times call for tough decisions. The whole crypto space feels like it's on a knife edge at the mo.
@_date: 2016-05-13 23:33:04
For sure I too am only thinking, 
2 of 3 would open both parties to a sybill attack. 
One possible way to resist ransom attacks would be to pay back the loan as btc into the same 2 of 2 address. Maybe this could also help to manage the risk?
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:50:23
You have a good point, this is certainly a flaw, even something as simple as  (honestly) losing one of the keys would be a bit of a nightmare.
Maybe both parties could be issued a pre-signed transaction which would allow either party to distribute the funds in a fixed ratio. I need to read up on signed transactions to see what is possible.
P.s. thanks to everybody who has taken the time to comment in this tread.
@_date: 2016-05-13 22:44:28
This is an interesting case, as with a 2 of 2 you would need my consent to sell the coins. Being realist it is not in the borrows interest to see the coins sold. 
Maybe the lender would have to adjust the interest rate to compensate for this risk. 
Even so if I could get access to 1/4 of the value of my btc at a low interest rate  &lt;5% it would be worth it.
@_date: 2016-05-14 08:01:59
 I've decided to try this idea out! If there is someone in Europe (sepa) Who would like to get a small loan (max 100e) from me with an apr of 5%.
Duration and repayment schedule are for the borrow to decide.
Collateral required will be 5x the loan amount and will reduce as the loan is paid back. All collateral will be held securely in a 2 of 2 multi sig.
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:12:28
Normally 6.
@_date: 2016-05-13 22:22:45
This had crossed my mind but I don't know what rate of interest I would pay on margin, I would have to carry the risk of sudden market movements closing my position. I would be exposed to greater counter party risk ie exchange colapsing.
If any body knows the current interest rate on margin I would like to know as it would help with the comparison.
