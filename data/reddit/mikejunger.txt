Without regulation, bitcoin is the sock puppet of the tech boom.

"Virtual currencies are a fucking joke" is a true statement to a degree. Its only value is a medium of exchange in the shadows. As far as speculation and legitimate business application, it is a fucking joke.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:11:43
They can't and they won't. Anyone that thinks a legitimate business will ever work with an unregulated medium of exchange without the ability to sue, chargeback, etc is delusional. BTC is good as a temporary ship to carry money overseas and buy weed, etc at SR....nothing more, nothing less. Others will just be using BTC as casino ships like we are seeing now and with another cycle of this or two, this nonsense will stop and it will go back to being used solely as a stable currency for "libertarian" behaviors.

Bitcoin's future is 100% tied to its price stability. BTC is hardly back. Maybe your short term investment is back...but that is a completely different concept from "Bitcoin is back".
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:45:44
"Who is behind the manipulation" is the wrong question. The real question is "Why am I making bets in a market that can be manipulated with impunity by anyone at any given minute".  BTC has no legal system, no politicians that are held accountable by voters, no laws regulating it, no groups of very bright economists (who sometimes fuck up yes) who most of the time implement policies that lend to its stability, no commodities traded with it (other than illegal stuff) to keep it supported.

They won't be available to the general public. The only people that will have them is those that design them and those that can publicize them so outfits like Butterfly can rip people off.  If you had a machine capable of making 100 BTC a month (at current difficulty) and better yet could run a row of them that you could make 50 or more BTC a day, how could selling these machines make more money for you? They would just raise the difficulty and make your own machines less profitable. Unless there's an ASIC maker that is a BTC idealist, we won't be seeing ASICs like Butterfly is touting for a long long time, if ever.

Qui est "bitcoin"? Il y a personne s'appele "bitcoin".
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:17:23
Everything going on now is purely speculation of course but if you want to know the real value of BTC, it is in the volume of buying and selling at Silk Road. Sites like SR HAVE to use BTC, they have no other choice. No legitimate business would ever use such a volatile currency no matter how well known it becomes. The real value of BTC is probably around $15 since buying and selling at SR hit a plateau when BTC was hovering around that amount.

Winners are the ones with the largest botnets and people that get lucky. Losers are everyone else.

You have zero protection with BTC and you will get bit eventually and it WILL sting. So my advice to people is only buy small things with BTC. Cup of coffee or CD/DVD from friends small.

It's going down like a lead zepplin tonight....it's a fight to see who can sell first. If you don't believe me, check out the 194 BTC sell those jackasses at MtGox allowed their people to execute 11 min ago.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:07:59
No, once the $100 psychological floor collapses, BTC will rapidly plunge back to it's real value of $7 +- a few bucks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:53:43
No, they would just be blackballed by one another. See entry "Wall Street Collateralized Debt Obligations and  Credit Default Swaps circa 2008" for more info.  Even Ayn Rands asskisser in chief, the "great" Alan Greenspan euphemistically admitted her ideas were "unworkable" after witnesses the unregulated trillion dollar shadow markets of CDOs and swaps. The real translation is "she was full of shit".

It was implemented in the first place. And then the guy claimed he was hacked and ran off with 500,000 bitcoin. Put your wallet on a data drive, mirror it or back it up regularly, encrypt both drives and only decrypt when moving the BTC in and out. Keep the drive offline the rest of the time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:59:22
It's like a casino except in a casino, if you catch the house cheating, they get shut down. When people with botnets and other manipulators cheat, they do so with impunity. If you want to play with BTC for fun or to learn, throw in $100 and enjoy it. Don't do it with any money you need to live on.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:39:57
If you are accepting BTC payments in a real world shop, you seriously need to rethink what you are doing. Unless you are instantly cashing out the BTC the moment of the sale, you are being reckless. Even if cashing out immediately, what if you hit a situation like yesterday where there is a tremendous lag and you can't cash out immediately. You could have $5000 in payments for the day that could be worth nothing in a matter of hours if you an exchange is overwhelmed and BTC crashes before your sell is executed.

Well somewhere in the world a guy just got shot in the spine and is paralyzed from the waste down. In another part, a kid was stuck in a house fire and has 3rd degree burns over 90% of his body. In another part a woman kissed a guy and the brothers threw acid on her face to save the family honor and she has no nose, lips or eyelids and is permanently disfigured.  In another part there's a little boy in sub saharan Africa drinking out of a river and a parasite from that water is eating his retinas right now making him blind for life......I could go on and on.

If they are smart sellers and they hedge, they will be fine. SR owners will basically lose a little of the massive gains they made from hedging sellers.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:26:05
The easiest way is to wait for the price to stabilize, buy BTC and move the BTC. Getting USD out of MtGox means going through Dwolla or another service, then to your bank, then to bitinstant or another service, then to the other exchange.

Don't ever trust any other human with your BTC....ever! You can't get it back, there's no regulation, no recourse, nothing.  Don't even keep BTC on the exchanges, trade then get it off there.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:49:33
Bingo! We have a winner. Reality rears its ugly head and speaketh the trutheth.

With regard to ASICs machines, if they can build a 50 Gh/s mining device that generates 100 BTC a month at the current difficulty, why in the hell would they want to sell those machines by the hundreds or thousands and get a crazy change in difficulty. I have no doubt that ASICs are in production by some like Avalon but they probably have a room full of them and they are making millions on them now. They have no intention of selling their Geese right now as they are easily laying these golden eggs. Until some idealistic competitor gets in the game and starts selling them for the sake of BTC, these current companies will just hang on to them. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:31:25
Butterfly labs is a complete scam. Just put ASICs out o fyour mind. If you have $3000 and want to get into mining AND you have cheap electricity, get yourself a couple of gaming machines with 2 7970s in each, install guiminer, sign up for a mining pool like BTC guild, Slush etc and have fun.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:54:33
Yes, if I'm a co-owner of MtGox with thousands of coins, I'd be telling everyone it's "testing" as well. Knowing full well the price is 40 bucks less on other exchanges and a sell frenzy is about to happen.

Local...and make sure the drive you save it on is mirrored (or backed up) and is encrypted. Truecrypt those drives and dismount them for local storage.

When it crashes through the $100 psychological floor, it will quickly go back to $10 (or less) per BTC where it belongs. After all, once we lose the 3 figures of the hundreds, all the double digit numbers look the same through the fog of panic.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:50:08
agreed. Without stability, there is no future for BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:50:02
Get right back out. Forget that it exists.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:40:15
No legal recourse, no chargebacks, no support in the courts, and on and on....and this is assuming there is price stability which obviously bitcoin doesn't have. I would further argue that the very nature of BTC as an unregulated entity lends itself to inherent volatility. It will therefore never be accepted by the masses. People all over the world buy US treasuries because we have a very diverse and well regulated fiat currency. When things get rough, they run to safety and that safety is regulation...not always done well but most of the time it is.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:14:38
Tell your friend about Silk Road, that will pretty much sum up bitcoin. It won't ever die but it won't ever be a common method of payments like PayPal or anything like that. It's used for dealing in the shadows and for some people to go to the casino at their keyboard....nothing more nothing less.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:35:25
People that were involved with BTC for years and know that it will settle in $7 to $14 range where it belongs. By "belongs" I mean it's real value which is its use to the communities involved in the the buying and selling of illegal goods and services. The price went up and down before the current bubble  based on demand for drugs and services and the BTC needed to move them.
BTC as an unregulated entity will always be inherently unstable and only used by people that are compelled to use it. No legitimate business or common sense person will exchange goods with such a volatile currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:11:02
BTC is an unregulated, Ayn Rand wet dream. It will never be a medium of exchange for legitimate business for that very reason. It is and will continue to be a way for people to operate in the shadows though.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:48:53
Less than a year ago $30 was the "remember that crazy spike that one summer?".  $7 to $15 is where it belongs. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:01:10
You are delusional. The real value of BTC is in the illegal substance, software and services business since they are compelled to use BTC. No legitimate business or person with common sense would use a medium of exchange as volatile as BTC. Silk Road buying and selling hit a plateau late last fall so I'm guessing BTC reality is about $12 to $17. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:15:07
How are you going to prove who paid whom in a transaction. It's not like there's a receipt or an ACH electronic trail to print out and take to court. There's no NACHA or Federal Reserve to regulate any BTC transactions like the ACH system.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:25:54
You'll be generating LOTS of heat and summer is just around the corner. Do you have a place to put the machines and will it be cool enough there? Be sure to calculate the cost of air conditioning when considering making your initial investment back.  Also, if those cards ride above 72C for too long, they'll burn out.
