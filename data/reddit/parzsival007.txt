well, well, my-my 
some one with a brain 
so a few things for people to seriously sit back and consider whilst were HODLing ( not financial advice i am not a financial advisory- however i will post 3 things for people to look at and do Du diligence- wont take long-
so the usd statement 
okay 
how about this one that horrible word that makes your skin crawl ( but after this it shouldn't)
alot of people should sit and think
regulation - now fiat vs cryptos- what are the most friendly nations to crypto and what are the worst?
well GB (gbp) is one of the worst wanting to tax the life out of it - japan contributes to 60-something% of market share and quite friendly. this is an article stating the above - cny china would be interesting two
 [ 
so my point is a draw off our usd friend sucking the life out of currency - or to put it another way sucking the life out of economy which some of us may live in and that our children live in
smoke and mirrors- Brexit?- trade war? - for fucks sake look at them and not this
   
  (paste that as it wont come up blue ) 
look at the 1 year chart on the 5th of the 5th 2019?
   
[   same thing look at the 5th of the 5th 19
weird japan one of the most friendly ? Britain one of the most unfriendly -
so what i would like to make a point of the power drive up in btc and the power drive down in gbp? and hows that for a market reacting to another markets decisions? swissy behaves similarly?
so back to our usd mans point?
yes its sucking the life out of currencys - greed and stupidity leads to bad things- he who controlls money controlls the world?
any who- some point the worlds going to run out of people who go into to the slaughter house? abit like draining a bath? i would perhaps look at this in this way - track wheat and corn?- cotton gold and silver - again for educational not financial advice.
or the 2nd thing at some point it could be regulated or de regulated? 
but i'm no expert i dont see it thing is the large economy have contend  onto this  - article on Sweden and there central banks going into the space
at some point youve got to think just because its going up and making money does not make it moral - somebody think of the children?
any exchange has the ability to down a coin or pair with wallet maintenance- what does this do?
fear and panic the coin will fall on the specific exchange and pronounce a arbitrage opportunity-which they are well aware of- they control the fear so therefor they control money ( not financial advice this is for education for the reader to do there own diligence)
big money maker a coin can drop 50%-100% and keep going and they don't give you any idea of when the wallet will be back up itl'l just get announced randomly?
so my point is even if btc is crashing or ether or what ever they can still position there selfs to turn a profit one way or the other?
on-top of transaction fee's ? 2 way profit making
some exchanges are now offering other facility's - money lending ? - why would you not lend the money you've acquired for free for a high premium? - money lending is one of the most profitable industrys along side being the house in gambling
"why are you mentioning" - i want to hodl?
well pinch your self for a moment whats that tell you - its another hedge strategy much like creating arbitrage via wallet maintenance?
why is this important- well its a SELF FULFILLING ponzy scheme? -
 harry Houdini
 " what the eyes see , and the ears hear, the mind believes"- this is why they go up and theyll make them keep going- only if the world has the money or the sheep with the money to facilitate this ? and even when thats gone they will have the money on the exchanges which they can manipulate with the wallet maintenance - transaction fees- lending?
basically lets call them the headed - 5 headed beasts? or in gambling - the house?- who always wins?
lets look at the mining businesses- well 3 weeks prior to btc 3 Minuit tictac romp of 9 k 
about 80 % of crypto sites i was looking at were offering mining gear for hire daily and annual fees ?
my educational point being- and not financial advice- is an extension of the usd man
its draining economy's - draining economy's will at some point lead to a crash? and i do not think this one will be funny at all the rate these things can suck money isn't funny? it isn't inspiring - think of the children or the children you want to have
think whilst there banging on about brexit- think whilst they are banging on about the trade war- just think
because they are also pyramid schemes? there are more looses than winners? and even if you win the pinical is the exchange or the house.
thing is ask your self this - would you leave a 3 year old in a room with a samurai sword? i fucking wouldn't
yet we have been allowed to have retail accounts trade cfd contracts trade bitcoin with a real trade platform yadayadayada
\-like it or not its the same thing-
\- the Scientology/ Pandora box theory - (no im not a Scientologist  no i am not calling them Scientologists) 
however they have a resemblance- remember how efficient tom cruise was - getting people to signed up then the people who had paid took them years to admit they had been raped by law financial because they didn't want to admit to there self's they had been royal fucked and paid for having it done to them? 
Pandora's box - once opened couldn't be closed and the people didn't nor wanted to understand what was inside?
thing is Russia - Swiss mining? lapse and welcoming japan Korea exchanges lapse approach Ireland lapse approach
if you don't unite and ban it - we are fucked? but its okay because john from whitcombe just lived his best life in a lambo?
but because of greed they wont - makes to much money but they can only make money whilst people have money
because if one doesnt agree because of all the sheep that one country will become prosperous? 
but personally with foresight i see famine greedy people and people who don't want to see it and admit to there self they have been duped that's up to them.
lets put it another way - the substandard coin (LOL!) 
how would you derive a substandard coin ( other than it not making money ) the point in this is to inspire people to have for-sight of what would happen to your three year old with a samurai sword?
coins get de-listed for being substandard tickles me- WHY?
there all substandard not one can beat our traditional banking system?
our traditional banking system miss-sold to us any one ever hear that guy who's piss'd that banks just print money into reality? 
and its sold as a bad thing- what happens when we are born? we a created into exhistance?
what happens with bitcoin ?-it stops being made?
so we are born into the world/ made into existence- yet were betting on bitcoin etherium- what ever? for the decentralised future for our children most of us have 2 children some 3?
3 bitcoin don't get made every time you get your leg over? or any digital asset for that matter and if they do the price doesn't moon lol another one that makes me laugh ITS GOING TO MOON HODL - your grandchildren aint going to be saying that?
but its okay john from kwalalumpa just brought a private jet with bitcoin?
thing is if a global patrician got started it would make sense- but the probability of this happening is slim?
to many people want to be like john and to hell with everything else - im not going to lie i wouldn't mind being john but at what cost?
i trade - but my reasons to trade are because i see the above i see not trading or understanding, not trying to learn as failing my son because no ones steping in so its the only option
 \- aka looking at what kimye just brought - or what sandra had for dinner- what mrs fuckin hinch just cleaned her last dildo with?- what prozy boris johnson has payed for, what brexit is doing- the trade war- global warming ( FUCK ME THINK OF WHAT ALL THIS MINING GEAR IS DOING????)
WAKE THE FUCK UP....................my partner suffers with endometriosis- my point is a caption used to promote awareness
 \- just because its not a bump or bruise or visible scar on my face ,doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it doesn't mean its not happening- it doesn't mean its not causing me pain?
think about that
WAKE UP
Before its to late- perhaps not in some of our life time but think of the children and the future of us.
remember this we were told alcohol was good for us once- its now not?
we were told smoking was good for us - its now not?
we are told cannabis is good for us ? ..... to be continued? its meant to help cancer? but then again so was Scientology? lol
