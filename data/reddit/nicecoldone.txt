I appreciate the comment and can genuinely understand the bitcoin support ideologically. The part I'm trying to wrap my head around is in order to imagine bitcoin as world reserve currency as its end goal, mass adoption would be needed. Would mass adoption happen when a small % of owners own the majority of a finite supply? Non-supporters today dont like bitcoin for a variety of reasons but the one I hear the most is because it is volatile. How much of that is due to the manipulation of a finite supply? Points were made that simply raising the denominator from satoshi to something infinitely more divisible can solve distribution but what about %? Why does distribution of wealth not matter in a finite supply or maybe the better way to ask is why is it we're ok if a very small group bitcoin owners own the majority of a world reserve currency?

I see the problem of it being finite. Practically speaking, I consider inactive bitcoins as lost because it is not in circulation for whatever reason. So forget the value which is what everyone wants to talk about, and wanted some thought around addressing the distribution and velocity. If satoshis have to be broken up to millisats etc, this kind of scaling makes the market even more susceptible to manipulation by the wealthy holding exponential millisats.

so who are the qualified custodians he is speaking of? Coinbase?
