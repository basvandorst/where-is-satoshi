What country do you live in? You can usually buy small amounts at a bitcoin ATM without ID. You can look on  to find one in your area. The next option would be to buy directly from someone who has them in your area but be careful meeting with people. Mycelium bitcoin wallet app has the option to search for local sellers and set up meeting with them.

It really sucks that they did this to you. Most exchanges show their limits on their website and I searched their website after reading your post and couldn't find any clear information about their limits and verification requirements. Sorry I can't really help more but I do hope you get things sorted out with them!

Most exchanges allow you to buy small amounts anonymously which is why your first transaction for $20 worked. Some exchanges also have daily or monthly transaction limits. $4000 is a large amount of money and you probably should have broken it down into multiple smaller transactions. They do this to prevent money laundering.

You can use any wallet, they don't have age limits. It's exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken that would require verification. You can give mycelium a try if you have an Android phone.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose. 
Try looking into Monero. I think that will be a great investment for the future!

I would use the daily average for each day worked since the price of bitcoin can fluctuate by a large amount each day. 
(bitcoin day average) × (number of hours) × (hourly wage)
Hourly tracking would be too complicated. Try explaining the calculation for each hour paid on a pay check �� and think of explaining that to an employee who isn't mathematically inclined.
Using the value after a bi-weekly period could cost the company more money as bitcoins tend to steadily increase. You'd most likely be paying them more by using the current rate rather than the lower rate on the day the work was completed.

It took 4 months to get my tier 2 verification on Kraken. What country are you in?

Coinbase or check Mycelium Marketplace for people in your area selling them.

Isn't that app a scam? Also, it offers "UP TO" 1000...it never actually gives that much.

I don't have a solution but I had the same issue. Did you include the unique reference note that is listed with the deposit information? I made a mistake when I typed it in and the money wasn't deposited to my account because the reference note was incorrect. Also, the bank verification will only be approved after your ID verification is approved.  
On a positive note, if the account is not approved they will refund the money that you tried to deposit. It takes about 4-6 weeks to be returned.

Mycelium wallet app allows you to buy with credit card but it's a 10% fee. Not bad if you're only sending $15
