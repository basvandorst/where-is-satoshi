Right .. so the hope is that since bitcoin is open source it will be developed quicker than it will be attacked ...

I agree with that logic accept that I am pretty sure the government wants control of the world. Why? Just look at everything they are doing. They want to build the world the way they want, not the one the commoner wants.
They same reason they want warrantless cellphone tracking, they want a completely controlled and tracked digital monetary system.
Edit: addition of second paragraph

When you believe in something, it is always good to question it as much as possible. Are you against questioning bitcoin? Or can you propose a better title? I truly regretted posting that title after I posted because I immediately realized people would down vote just because the title was cliche and negative sounding . Pay attention to the content of the post, thats what is important.

That is a good point titty fucker. Interesting how a tech that benefits them and/or they create may ultimately lead to their undoing. I really think bitcoin and tor are huge forces working against them. I geuss they either don't realize the scope of these projects (which is kind of hard to believe). Weird because I also really do think the US gov. is too creepy powerful and wants complete control.

Dont you think that if I know what ASIC is, I probably know that GPU mining superseded cpu mining?
