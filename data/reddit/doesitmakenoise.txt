[You can have this one for free.]( It's the rarest pepe I own.

Personally I think the format they're using over there is pretty cool. Easy tipping.

No one here will get it. This is hilarious and I love it.

I own the website. The reason for the price is the quality of the shirt. All of our shirts are premium fabrics and not screen print, even if some of the designs are silly. We vaporize ink directly into the fabric so you can't feel it, it never fades, and it let's us print high resolution images w/ lots of colors on many of our designs.
I did license this from the original artist here... if anyone wants to print their own, I suggest possibly asking him permission first? Just saying since I strongly believe in artist support.

Thanks for the shoutout mate! Hope you enjoy the shirt =)
It was funny to come here looking for the latest bitcoin craziness and seeing this at the top.

Same here. Be sure to sign up for the bitcoin meetups on meetup.com.
Robocoin is doing something wrong if it's CEO is from Vegas. Doesn't really surprise me, without any drama added, the ATM there had the most insane margins I've ever seen.

I work mostly directly with artists and I help put food on their families table. Everything on SWC is user-submitted and then I find the original work. We're an artist discovery platform in many ways.
One really awesome artist from our last round of designs was very near broke when I emailed him. We directly contribute to his family's ability to eat. Not only did I enjoy helping but I was able to pass along the story to the user in our community that originally submitted the idea. It helps reconfirm my decision to be one of the only legit companies in the apparel business doing this stuff, since [no one else gives a fuck about intellectual property](
Art is largely very difficult to monetize and survive doing. I *highly* doubt is a "statist businessmen". He did, however, contribute to the single most successful advertisement in Reddit's history that funnels new users here.

That's usually not USPS's fault... customs. I feel you on that one though. If something is stuck in customs, I usually just reprint + ship even though it still may come out.
EDIT: Checked out your site. Keep up the good work brotha. I like the personable wording on it.

Hah, that'd be funny if he did have that. 
People report back that it's actually more subtle that we, the internet people, would think it is. Most just see it as a spaghetti shirt (which I suppose isn't wrong).
No reported stab victims *yet*.

Our concept isn't a normal shirt vendor and the shirts themselves are superior to the quality that anyone else, at least in the BTC space, is providing.
I went a bit more into detail [here](
If you look at most of our shirts, they are all-over print with a specific (and expensive) printing method. That said, it may be time to lower the cost on this since I mostly just care about people getting things they want. This is more of a one-off type print for us so it costs more to do.
All in, my profit margin on this stuff is pretty shameful given the products we're producing. I do a large majority of the work still besides manufacturing itself.

What size is your shirt? I'll have to look at the design.
Overly big and all-over prints has kinda turned into our "thing" though.
