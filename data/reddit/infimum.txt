Hey, sorry for the late reply, I've been afk.
The gist of quantum bitcoin is that the tokens themselves are unclonable thanks to the no-cloning theorem. When all the coins have been mined there is no need to update the blockchain with transaction metadata, as the coins can be verified directly by the receiving end.
The paper is still an extended abstract, and just like you say we have some details still to work out. Stay tuned!

From the paper:


paradigm for money, just like Bitcoin did in 2008.

Interesting ideas. The Quantum Bitcoin technology is very flexible in terms of how the minting is to be done. Just a matter of politics to implement, and then nothing is in the way of pre-minting and distribution.
Who knows, maybe someday there'll be pre-minted "exit scam quantum coins" :P
@_date: 2016-04-06 15:06:18
If there is anything I can clarify, just ask away.

Sorry for the late reply, I've been afk.
I don't really understand why we have to divide technology into "interesting" and "not interesting". To me, what matters is that it works. A blockchain is essentially a data structure that can hold arbitrary information where the only operation is to append via this election process. The end result is a mechanism for achieving consensus in a distributed environment, whether it applies to account statements or adding new descriptors for quantum bitcoin.
What I must stress about quantum bitcoin is that transactions do not require adding information to the blockchain. Just like banknotes and coins, they are not clonable (thanks to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics) and can be verified by the receiving party without having to add a transaction to the blockchain. This is what prevents double-spending in quantum bitcoin. The whole idea of the paper is to show that we can do better when we go from a classical setting to a quantum-mechanical one. Transactions are still impossible to revoke and censor, just like in Bitcoin.

When you have mined a classical descriptor you use equation (1) to construct the quantum state.

Blast!! My master plan, foiled! 
@_date: 2016-04-06 14:43:45
The answer is yes, no and yes. :)
Yes, because you need to prepare quantum states to mint quantum bitcoin. 
However, you don't need to actually produce the quantum states yet. Start mining now. Note that mining != minting, and that mining in quantum bitcoin is done on a normal, classical computer. Later, when it is experimentally possible to prepare the quantum states corresponding to what you mined, get rich selling your pre-mined quantum bitcoin. So the answer is no.
Yes, because there is a cutoff (parameter T_max) time after which the states must have been prepared before they expire. 
Then there's the discussion if "preparing quantum states" requires a quantum computer, but that's just semantics. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 20:13:40
More or less so, yes.
@_date: 2016-04-10 12:04:57
I know you're joking, but the no-cloning theorem ( is a highly surprising result of quantum mechanics. Check it out!
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:21:18
Read the paper and skip the technical stuff, you'll understand a lot if you know the basics of btc. The no-cloning theorem gives us unforgeable tokens (i.e. quantum states). All the rest is just technical stuff to verify the quantum states and describe them in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:18:11
Good question. I would guess decades at least.
@_date: 2016-04-07 16:35:33
Again, Quantum Bitcoin uses a blockchain, but in a different way than in Bitcoin. Bitcoin elects a peer to select the next block (which happens to contain Bitcoin transactions), Quantum Bitcoin elects a peer to select the next block (which happens to contain a description of a new quantum bitcoin). 
I'm not sure that I understand your question, could you perhaps rephrase it?
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:39:13
Decades at best
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:17:33
You could start with a new blockchain (which is easy since all the btc software is open source) and generate classical serial numbers and public keys. As long as T_max does not run out you'll be able to turn them into Quantum Bitcoin (or shards) when the technology arrives.
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:22:09
Mining is classical, but minting is quantum. Also, I wouldn't consider the preparation of quantum states (i.e. quantum bitcoin minting) to be a quantum computer operation in the first place, but again, that is semantics.
@_date: 2016-04-06 14:53:48
You could say that.
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:38:59
Entirely new currency quite different to BTC.
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:21:08
Why wouldn't it offer a solution? Quantum Bitcoin uses a blockchain, just like Bitcoin, the difference is that it uses a blockchain only in the minting department.
@_date: 2016-04-06 15:01:33
I'm the author. Thanks for posting it, didn't want to self-advertise.
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:15:55
All the blockchain stuff with difficulty adjustments and limited supply is abstracted away into the ledger scheme L. In that way, the minting rate is limited to the rate decided by that blockchain.

Sounds great! Just don't cram too much information onto a single flyer, nobody would read it.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:13:06
Great news. In my opinion, Webhallen is one of the better electronics retailers in the country. Good prices and great service. Nice from then to start accepting Bitcoin. In fact, this will be the first Bitcoin store in my city (Linköping).
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:48:35
Great! There are a few errors in the presentation but nothing too big.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:09:22
There are several PhD students around Europe fully or partially working on bitcoin, myself included.

@_date: 2016-12-08 22:48:10
Interesting, thanks! 
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:13:44
Absolutely not my experience. Bitcoin = money = corruption just as in fiat.
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:25:01
Sorry, you are absolutely right. I forgot that all ransomware authors really don't mean to do harm, the code just wrote istelf by accident.

Some good answers here already, esp. regarding the lawyer. 
I don't know where you are based, but 147 bitcoin is roughly $90k, a sizable sum. Might be best to make a complete image of the computer. Bit-by-bit, so it can be examined in great detail later. Also a good idea for evidence in a court case. Might be a good idea to talk to the police and have them make the forensics (or send it to a lab).
If you need more specifics, you can send me a PM. Part of my work in academia is in Bitcoin and I have some contacts in forensics. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 12:57:15
IANAL, but the person who stole them could be held liable for the full amount (?)
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:12:41
That's why he needs a lawyer/prosecutor.
