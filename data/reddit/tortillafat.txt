That almost never works.

I know right?  To simplify it seems like the whole thing is on the barter system.  Two parties agree upon a certain number of bitcoins as payment for work, used car, hotel room, or whatever.  The bitcoins are generated by miners and are essentially 'valueless' (in fiat terms). As long as bitcoin operates outside of the fiat system all is good, but as soon as we attach a 'dollar' value to a bitcoin and convert it to dollars that's where the systems collide.  Everyone seems excited about the futures market but doesn't that just make bitcoin that much more 'mainstream' and regulated?  How do you even value it? If I gave someone a bitcoin two weeks ago did I give them $0, $10,000, $17,000 what?   If I go to register a car and tell them I paid two bitcoins for it (for registration tax purposes) I'm sure they'll come up with a FMV for it.  Same with vastly inflated bitcoins.  If I paid $100 for a bitcoin (now worth 15K) I can get much more goods and services now with that coin from bitcoin accepting retailers.  I'm sure they have a way to tax that even though it was never converted - again with fair market value.  Disclosure: I dont own any.

Good for you and congratulations. You had to sell to just another guy person to person?   I'm watching this action from the cheap seats - now more of a study in market dynamics. Nothing goes up 10% a day for very long, right? I dont know, I've been 100% wrong so far. Recall the poem from T Roosevelt- hat's off to those in the arena:
"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

how can you get 17k?

They could also point out that (almost) everything a person worried about in the past has come out OK. Tnorthb is right though, it'll always be something. I believe long term depression actually damages your brain- you cant get out of it.  If you get rich, then she'll worry about losing that.. "rich" is all relative anyway... in the USA people complain about being 'poor' while there are millions of refugees taking rafts across the sea and living in camps - makes a small house in America look pretty good.  BTC is a gamble and be aware the bottom falls out a lot faster than the climb up.  Hopefully all the holders a year from now are celebrating $100k/BTC and not lamenting how they owned it $11K and didnt sell.  Even if I had owned  BTC at a low price I guarantee I wouldn't have made it this far.  I try to imagine how i would live if money were no object (make a list). One of them is I would live more simply, get rid of distractions, exercise more - turns out I can live that way right now and it doesn't cost anything extra.

count on it... of course i've been saying that since it crossed $1000 so what do i know?  even a broken clock is right twice a day.

In the title it says "24 volume" guess it's a 24 hour volume but not sure how you calculate that on the 1 year or "all" settings. For me its all relative as long as they leave the rate a constant.  For instance at the beginning of the year the volume was much higher (makes sense since the price was lower).  People used to throw the things around - stories about the guy that spent 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza... stuff like that.

Saw that at $2750 ish also short term.  Set the chart above on one year.  All that volume up to $1000..that's where this supply is coming from...imho

It's not so far-fetched. They did it with gold in the 30's... just came out one day and made it illegal to own or spend. I don't own bitcoin because I don't understand why people consider it 'currency' (other than it has the word 'coin' in it).

Volume is an indicator of activity.  Can anyone explain the volume on the bitcoin chart?  In stocks volume is # shares traded.  In the bitcoin chart it's showing '2 billion'.  Is that 2 billion dollars?  Cant be 2 billion bitcoins, right?  There's only a max of 21 million of those as i understand it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:40:28
Thanks.  Weird way of doing it since you have to figure the price.  Back in January lets say the price was $1000 and volume $6 billion (per the graph) that's 6 million coins.  Now price is $3000 (round numbers) but volume is $2 billion that's three times the price but 1/3 the 'volume' that's 666,666 coins (almost 10 times fewer coins traded).

At $64 billion the market cap is about the same as Buffett's checking account (or 8% the size of Apple). I dunno.

Next they'll come up with a 3x ETF. Then a short 3x.......
