I really, really hope that this isn't the real Nakamoto. If he is, he's going to be a target by governments, scam artists, criminals, and other unscrupulous persons for the rest of his life.
Whether or not he's the deal deal, the journalist reporting all of this is being so reckless that she might as well be pointing a gun at him herself. She must've figured that because he wasn't co-operating with her, she might as well go ahead and publish EVERYTHING.

I don't see what that has to do with his trustworthiness. To quite the contrary, he tried to have the guy killed because he was threatening to snitch on SR's userbase, threatening tens of thousands of people with awful fates under the U.S. justice system just so that he could walk off with cold hard $$$.
Honestly, there are worse reasons to have someone killed.

Eh, I don't have a problem with the internet cafe part. That's how OBL was still able to communicate via the internet. Using the same one *repeatedly*, though, was just stupid.

It's pretty obvious that you've never been anywhere near real money, near really expensive areas.
$150k is straight up nowhere near enough to risk your career over if you're in the upper deciles of the income curve. The top 1% (3.5 million Americans) make at least that much, *per month.* If you're in the top 1%, even a million dollars isn't really enough, since that's less than one year's income. As a general rule you'd want to risk your career for the sake of *several year's* income. 
Also, the median US income is $52,000 in 2014. Get your facts right, this takes 2 seconds to google. There are nearly 200 million people in this country for whom $150k isn't enough to take a significant felony risk in my opinion.

Oh, damn. You're right. I didn't make a distinction there.

Haha, nah, I'm not advocating. I'd only support a return to tyranny if humanity was facing existential crisis as a species, which doesn't seem to be on any horizon on any timeframe. But if you want to criticize tyranny effectively, you have to be frank and intellectually honest about it, which inevitably includes admitting that humanity has for the most part gotten by just fine for the past hundred thousand years under tyrannies of various shades and names. Democracy is very new and still a work in progress by comparison. The two systems have relative and situational strengths and weaknesses that any serious advocate of freedom has to honestly engage with.

Do *you?* History is filled with examples of excellent, powerful monarchs. Problem is that the bad ones could get pretty damn bad.

Bloomberg in all of its forms, basically.

That's the way it normally goes with bubbles.

Whatever. Even one average sized fund couldn't put more than 1% of its AUM into btc without causing an epic spike. Insofar as high finance is concerned, bitcoin is a joke, and will remain a joke until the total amount of bitcoin outstanding is approaching well over $10 billion.
Believe me, the Bloomberg is an amazing tool, and its applicability for markets of genuine consequence is without limit. 
This is not to say that I don't believe in bitcoin, but it's better to treat it as a pinksheets penny stock than an investment-grade asset.
