In certain states. Not sure about liquor but I know beer and wine are able be bought where I live online. Never really looked into liquor cause there's like 100 liquor stores near me. I just wanna find a nice new beer to fall in love with.

SO THE TABLE TURNS.
Glad to see the journalist become the journalized

Figures after I make the post two days later they just decided to update it. Thanks a lot anyway glad to hear I will be resolved soon. Deleting this post now!

A good selection of craft beers. Not beers like coors and stuff. I'm not sure exactly which beers. If you look on Honest Brew you'll see what kind of stuff I mean better

No I'm not I'm genuinely looking for an alternative. Circle made me email support and I can't find anything else that will allow me to do this.
Also if I was fishing for a donation why the hell would I want only $2?
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:59:54
I agree I just think anybody would end up being a dick if you're pushed into it. I'm sure at this point they've had numerous death threats etc not counting having to hire people to read emails and everything else. I'd be a little mad if people were consistently bad mouthing me because of this or that and I'd be a little defensive over people asking me questions. People expect too much and this is what happens when people expect too much.
@_date: 2013-06-02 04:29:44
I don't have a high end CPU but I have a bunch of worthless ones. Sadly I've already tried LTC but the difficulty was too much for it to be even remotely valuable. I think it'd take me a lifetime to get even just one litecoin haha.
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:01:36
I think for the people with obviously delayed orders should have their orders discounted till it reflects the future profitability of the ASIC's bitcoin mining ability. With difficulty increasing in just a few days even the people who have received their Jalapeno's will only be getting about ~$12 a day I'd be lucky to get ~$5 with mine whenever it arrives. $308 for what could be a paperweight and THEN on top of that disregarding refunds? "All sales are final unless we fail to perform" I think the falling value due to the wait denotes a failure.
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:58:08
Yeah that's why I figured would be the case. I go from practically nothing to paying all this money and they go "Hmm, let's phone him up and ask him" and I tell them "Bitcoins!" and they call the cops thinking I'm a drug dealer or something. I want to live regularly and have my money WITHOUT the frustration of explaining where it came from or being accused of something negative like stealing or dealing drugs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:08:41
Yeah but once you use coinbase what next? Wire transfer to any bank? I don't have a clue what happens after that or if I should call and say "yeah I have a transfer coming in from Coinbase from me exchanging bitcoin" or if I have to do anything with taxes even though my BTC so far comes from mining not investing.
How do you get the cash? Mail? Do they send the cash first or something?
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:37:53
Yeah I don't know what this is.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:00:40
Sure they do. They always want to know where 20k came from flat out of the air. You seem to think that paying taxes nobody cares where and how you came upon large sums of money.
Lots of drug dealers get caught by trying to put large sums in the bank. If you don't have something to launder it with like a business that can make large sums of money then you're going to be accused of dealing drugs and be investigated. You can't possibly expect to phone your bank and say "I have twenty thousand dollars coming in from selling bitcoins" 
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:05:01
Well I don't think bitcoin will deflate. Perhaps I used the wrong word. 
I meant that since bitcoins will be harder to come by because of the difficulty rising bitcoin value will "Inflate" meaning it will become worth more USD per BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-10 01:30:00
this is my kind of post
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:55:45
Yeah they're my go to bank. Do you wire transfer or what to and from? 
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:52:12
$3 a week when you paid $50 doesn't sound very good to me..
I'm not sure if that's what you were saying though
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:52:39
The boundaries to what you are able to define as "actual money" are being pressed as bitcoin can and is used as actual money. The term you're looking for is fiat.
The reason for this process after becoming a millionaire is only if you plan to exchange your coin for fiat as fiat is a regulated currency and is subject to taxation. You would then have to report to your taxes that you had capital gains and pay the fees for gaining such money which is the same way you would if you had won the lottery.
Bitcoins are about as safe holding them unprotected on your computer as having a million dollars in a bag in your back yard. If you had such money you would take care of it or at least expect a bank to no? 
In the future it seems as though NeoBee is planning to make bitcoin banks where you would be able to send them your bitcoins so they would store them for you but that is only in the future and as of now you can only buy stock in their company.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:35:43
They're one of the big banks I've heard a lot of horror stories about when it comes to BTC namely freezing your account and refusing withdraws. Be really careful.

On the havelock page "Each 1 share of ASICM represents 1/100th of a share of ASICMINER maintained and verified by either Friedcat or any officially designated exchange, and has rights to 1/100th of the dividends of a whole ASICMINER share."
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:05:16
I see that now. Investing in stocks made me broke. Hindsight sucks.
If I had saved the Bitcoins flat out I'd have about $5000 or so right now. More than enough to buy everyone xmas presents.
@_date: 2013-07-08 06:02:33
I'm gonna be completely honest and try to be unbiased about it as someone who owns a preorder from BFL. 
I think it's kind of ridiculous in a way how we are acting towards BFL at this point I do agree some things were done wrong (this is their first business I'm assuming and accidents happen let it go) as well as people being pushy and forceful about when this is gonna happen or when that is gonna change (need I remind you ~two months ago everyone thought they'd never ship ANY asics and now that they are you're all still mad cause its not fast enough for you)
To me that sounds like impatience. You bought a preorder not anything more not anything less. You are entitled to an ASIC (WHEN IT COMES) not tomorrow, you won't get it tomorrow no matter how many times you ask for an update. Quit crying and mine with whatever you've got till then. Yeah you're not going to get millions of dollars over night but if you're buying an ASIC to become a millionaire then JUST BUY BITCOINS FLAT OUT RIGHT NOW AND HOLD THEM 
I know this'll get downvoted to oblivion but I just had to get it off my chest. This is starting to sound like this subreddit is becoming money hungry entitled pricks.
This all goes for Avalon too. Now people are crying about them because they're too slow. How about you go build your own ASIC and tell me how long it took. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 08:28:24
I've looked into it but the page to buy shares looks confusing to me. Is there a tutorial for it  or anything? 
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:27:05
Someone appears to be DDoSing my brain
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:25:15
You don't really have to go through this process unless you suddenly became a millionaire overnight which is exactly what people who win lotteries and such go through. This is by no means an ordinary task the average bitcoin noob would encounter.
It's daunting to take care of what you have when you are essentially your own bank. This is why we pay banks to do it with our fiat instead of burying it in our back yard.
Everything worth doing is worth doing right, do you want safe money or no money?
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:39:55
Well the problem is that I will be making the same.
Bitcoins on GPU: low hashrate - low profit 
5GH/s with raised difficult: high difficulty - high value for bitcoin = less bitcoins and thus = low profit
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:03:17
Exactly. 99% of people encountered won't know what the hell a bitcoin is and if your job is to handle peoples money then you're gonna question it because it's a security issue. For all they know you're a bank robber or something. I wish everyone knew what bitcoins were 
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:56:57
As someone who regularly uses Bitcoin but has not heard of SnapCard I appreciate your review! I just watched the promo too and it seems to be pretty great and really simple. This is what it's all about people!
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:34:15
Sure can. Practically everything goes in $5 or $10 increments.
@_date: 2013-06-01 04:02:59
How many shares do you own?
If my understandings of dividends are correct you are paid on a (weekly?) basis?
how much do you receive by your dividends?
Do they fluctuate like BTC profitability?
Are you only able to pay in BTC not USD/EUR etc?
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:54:01
That page makes MUCH more sense than some of the others I've seen. Thank you a lot. 
For another thing would you mind if I asked you a few questions about your shares?
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:51:12
Yeah I understand your points a lot. Like I said in the title I was just curious I don't even have $100 in bitcoins yet because I just started. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:46:16
So am I right to think that [following this]( is really going to yield me the results it claims to (I know that the price fluctuates a lot but does the difficulty level fluctuate in such a way as well?)
I've done the math on it and I should be able to afford the 5GH/s model from BFL in about 4 months if I don't choose to invest some money into buying bitcoins.
I would like to keep my investments as organically bitcoin as I can but I'm willing to make a small investment for an ASIC device to speed up the process. In two months I would be able to afford the 25GH/s if the price stays in the same area with using the 5GH/s model and then so on.
Also I don't pay for the electric and my GPU runs at a fair rate of 400MH/s
@_date: 2013-05-10 04:11:46
Finally don't feel alone! Haha. If I go out you're coming with me!
Nah but ill kick my own ass if this ends up being a poor investment. That'd really suck. Some people on here gave me some hope though. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 09:37:46
Very cool to see it all work. I just recently signed up myself. I still need to learn the values and get some of my own bitcoins to tip with
@_date: 2013-05-31 08:52:47
Yes I know the profitability calculator on Dustcoin is good but this was more so about pump and dump coining or regular mining.
@_date: 2013-07-10 20:54:05
Overclocking? What's the word on this?
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:52:34
Ah interesting. Thanks for clarifying that.
@_date: 2013-06-01 06:53:59
But how does that make you money vs just mining it myself on my GPU. I may about 1 - 2 a day that's like $7 or more dollars a week as opposed to $3 a week. No need to down vote cause we disagree people I'm just trying to make sense of it.
@_date: 2013-07-10 01:19:41
Well to make more sense I did ask the question in reference to TAT.Asicminer not PT (albeit he did get them mixed up he wasn't as wrong as it may appear to some his math was right)
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:05:51
If I knew how I would start a Wiki page for it.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:12:24
I hope you have a dehumidifier in that room as well because the A/C can moisten the air and create condensation in your rigs. I talked to a guy a little while ago who killed off a couple motherboards and GPU's over that issue.
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:03:21
You can by gift cards on with the  app which is really great. I used it to buy my dad a gift off of Amazon with Bitcoin for this past fathers day. He was impressed.
they have $5 to $10 gift cards with absolutely no fees for well over 200 retailers like Amazon, Gamestop and even Marriott hotels and pretty much anywhere you would want to spend money at the mall.
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:27:07
200 full shares or 200 passthrough shares?
That's where I get everything messed up cause I have to calculate the difference between passthrough shares vs full shares. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 21:08:28
Wow someone needs to make a video on that!
@_date: 2013-05-31 18:30:51
Interesting. That's what I figured. I wish someone would come through with results about coin hopping to see if it's more profitable to jump coin to coin based off of their pumped up profitability.
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:51:22
yeah I'm not trying to avoid taxes if I went that route either way I would be fine with paying them I just don't want it to be an issue with my bank and have it become an investigation. I'm sure if I did they would call me and be confused and I'd say "Bitcoin sales" and they would call the cops haha.
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:53:43
Sounds more like I'm going on the run or something. I'm not trying to live paranoid about my money though.
I'd be fine spending it in somewhat small increments on a debit card though. Do they have a bitcoin to USD debit card? all the ones I see are debit cards for euro's
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:15:14
In my take on it I knew the complications getting into it. I understand that a preorder can take really long to receive its just simple. It says so clearly on their page there's no hiding it. I'd probably be a dick if everyone who ordered a preorder was blowing me up asking when it was coming when I was just trying to work. If people weren't so hard on them maybe instead of hiring more people to do email response etc they'd of hired more people to put asics together or more equipment. To me it sounds like everyone got a preorder and feels entitled to the delivery of last year and simply cannot deal with it so they harass the people in hopes of speeding up the process. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 11:44:19
If you're referring to the ones on Havelock then they are 1/100th it even says so on the info for the shares. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:56:25
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:13:01
I agree. Some things at the moment can't be bought with bitcoin and with the price fluctuating so much if I see thing I absolutely need now I will transfer a little BTC into USD in order to do it. I know a lot of people will say "just hold it" or "use gyft" or "spending bitcoin not getting usd is better!" but you really do need the ability to do it for bitcoin to continue to thrive. All other currencies are exchangeable. Hopefully bitcoin becomes easier to exchange soon.
@_date: 2013-07-10 01:17:44
Rather the reason I asked is because I wasn't exactly sure if the number I was getting for it were correct. I wasn't sure if the dividends I saw people receiving were based on TAT shares or a full 100/100 share and I knew the people here would know which was which. The issue with calculation was that I can't find a calculator where I can input the price of bitcoin as stated above "~100" every one I come into contact with calculates at todays price which would hinder my math.
