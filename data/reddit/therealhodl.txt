Its transactions that people are trying to send that havent been confirmed in a block.
It is indeed a long wait for many people. I paid a 262 sat/byte transaction earlier today and it took ~6 hours to confirm. I hate to think how long it will take for people paying 50 sat/byte fees.

Yep not loading for me as well. Gonna be looking for a new wallet as soon as this mess is over.
EDIT: It is working now. Still pissed.

Is it that unreasonable to assume that with the price shooting up like crazy that there would be many more transaction than usual?
Assuming I'm reading the mempool stats right, there are ~140,000 unconfirmed tx's at 50+ sat/byte, which seems like legitimate tx's to me (or very expensive spam).
Regardless of whether its spam or not, doesn't that still mean there is an issue? 
And no, I'm not some BCH shill, I get that the same thing could happen on their chain with a ton spam of tx's.

I have been enjoying the free streams on [BitcoinPornCams.com]( - I can't speak to how the private shows are, but there are lots of girls on there.
There's also some others such as [Strip4Bit]( that get recommended, but I haven't used it. Seems kinda sketchy.

There's definitely some good sites listed there, but its not an exhaustive list. For example, there are hundreds of adult sites that accept Bitcoin, not just Naughty America. [The Bitcoin Porn Directory lists quite a few more adult sites that accept Bitcoin]( ( - NSFW.
