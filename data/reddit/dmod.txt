Congrats! I wish I had invested earlier. I still remember having a long discussion about bitcoins with a friend about 6 months ago. I swore I was going to get back into it (after dabbling when the tech first was released), but I never did until the price skyrocketed.
Enjoy your success, you earned it!

Unfortunately, there aren't any direct "click to buy" methods to use your credit card or paypal. If you want it quick, most people will use bitinstant, but that requires you to go somewhere to make a physical deposit.
You can use Virwox (and use a credit card or paypal), but first you have to buy SLL (virtual currency for Second Life), then buy BTC with SLL. It's more expensive because they are taking a cut on every step.
In Australia, blockchain allows you to buy bitcoin by adding it to your phone bill. You might want to check that out too.

I'm guessing the way to go here, is sell giftcards in dollar amounts that can be redeemed for whatever the current market value of bitcoins are. I would think it would be really hard to sell a X BTC giftcard because of market fluctuations though.

You might have *coined* a new catch phrase...

The biggest struggle Bitcoin faces is actually getting a significant amount of people to use it to purchase goods and services. The exchange rate isn't high because of the real world adoption of the currency, but because people are using it to gamble on speculation. I would say the majority of the currency is pooled amongst a few addresses (as your photo shows), a good amount of currency has been lost and that there is very little actually being used to buy things. The rest is "investment".

Thanks, I'll check it out!

It won't show up until 6 confirmations.

I knew it would be a long shot, but I was hoping to find someone I could work something out with.

My favorite thing about Bitcoin is that it really has the power to shake up everything we know about currency. I have speculated for years that something digital would come along that would change the world as we know it and I think Bitcoin is it.
The fact that it's also an exciting goldrush that is making people rich is just a bonus! :)

There are only two ways I know of to use paypal to get Bitcoins.
1. Buy on ebay at a huge markup
2. Use Virwox. Here you have to buy SLL (Second Life money) with paypal, then exchange SLL for bitcoins. This is expensive because they take a cut on every step, but still cheaper than ebay.

I was so confused when I first saw the tip process happening on another subreddit. It's what actually what brought me here.
So while, I have heard about and even used to own bitcoins a long time ago, bitcointip bot peaked my interest to get back into it again!

I can't even imagine some random person on the internet gifting such a large amount to another random stranger. That's absolutely amazing! Makes me wish I got in on this earlier so I could spread the wealth.

I did some mining very early on and accumulated right around 5 BTC. I gave them away! They weren't worth much and I had a couple friends who were A LOT more interested in it than I was, so I just split them up and gave them away. 
Now, I have .02 BTC to my name. I never thought bitcoins would be viable currency, but I was flat out wrong on that one. I'm only now starting to get back in the game.

You can play the speculation game and hope the price continues to go up. I think there is a lot of room to grow in that respect, but the real key to success is how viable it is as a currency.
I think the "gold rush" mentality will actually help fuel some of that growth towards being a universally accepted payment method, but I think the biggest hurdle is how to actually acquire these things. To the average person, the process for acquiring bitcoins is so damn shady. Once someone can figure out a safe, easy way to exchange the currency you have for bitcoins, then I think it stands a real shot of success.

I have no intention of charging back. I am just looking for a quick way to pick up a bitcoin. I wouldn't be posting on here with my main account if I had any intention of scamming the community.

I would probably push for the value of coins at the time you purchase. Since the card will have to be activated at the register (like all other giftcards), those coins can be allocated right there.
Having an integrated wallet is probably the most consumer friendly. They buy the card, take it home and enter in the information on the website and they have a wallet with bitcoins waiting.

I had a couple coins in an old wallet, but I gave them away to friends who were more interested in it than I was a long time ago (when they weren't worth anything noteworthy at all). Oh well, live and learn!
