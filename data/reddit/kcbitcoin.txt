Well, this is a fully open AMA, so it probably means most Chinese are Classic supporters then.

I don't think he cares to. Especially to someone trust him about 0%.

Forgot to highlight it. Look at row  (Size).
Just in case you didn't know, one block can only process 1MB of data, and 90+% of the blocks are over 990K. i.e. Bitcoin max capacity reached, growth is limited.

Looks very polished. Definitely more user friendly that other iOS wallets. I too have downloaded most of iOS wallets and Breadwallet so far gives me the best user experience. 
Faster response speed than HIVE, simpler UI than Greenaddress, and definitely a lot cleaner than the crappy blockchain app.
One thing I noticed is that at the login screen, Breadwallet does not allow you to open up a new wallet somehow. Is it being implemented and going to be added in the future?

In the section where it asks "if so what was the value of bitcoins or fiat currency held on the Mt. Gox exchange on Feburary 7, 2014?"
If we had bitcoins on there, do we put the number of bitcoins we have or we put the fiat "value" of bitcoins?

Holy crap

Yes, that's what he means, like why are they performing unless mathematical problem, it's a wasting of time/energy.
@_date: 2014-09-13 23:16:04
Sry, by saying passwords, I mean the PIN. What I meant was what if the user forget the PIN and cannot access the wallet? There is no other option on the login page other than "enter the PIN". 
So I was wondering if he could add some other options at the bottom like, recover a wallet(using the 12-word seed), and create a completely new wallet.

I don't think he would like to think on that riddle, cuz he is stubborn. 
But I can try to explain to him like the miners form a network that verifies financial transaction. Since the if one transaction is verified by everybody on the planet, the transaction can be seen as confirmed, right? 
Another question from me, how exactly do they "verify" one transaction?

I too find a brain-wallet it too dangerous for people who cannot think of a series of phrases that's complicated enough.
I also tend to use a BIP38 encrypted wallet generated offline.
One more question, if I'm using bitaddress.org on a computer that will never go online again to generate a BIP38 encrypted wallet, how many characters do you think will be secure enough so that I can throw my encrypted private key online, say keep it in my email.

Thanks for collecting all these videos!!

How can a transaction never confirms?
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:08:18
Where can we see the core nodes numbers?
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:09:38
I would like a brief summary of what he said please. It seems very interesting.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:25:55
Just use litecoin.

Look at this graph here. 
The dark yellow area shows the values in bitcoin currently stuck in mempool, look at how much it is(over 9k currently). 
Just because you haven't had any issue, doesn't mean others don't. 
Please, show some respect/mercy for unlucky people like OP or me rather than assuming our PC is malfunctioning.

Hey lucky you. Mine is still stuck after two days. =)
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:42:53
No. In the picture, It does show that they processed over 5000 bitcoin value in that block. I don't think it is a waste at all.
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:16:09
Because we have small block limit. Expect more of this in the future if the devs don't raise it. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:07:36
so people are not supposed to receive unconfirmed transactions if they can be returned then, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:47:28
Are u able to withdraw Canadian dollar from Quadriga?
I heard some ppl have been waiting for over 2 week on the fun, and still counting.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:05:39
Maybe most influential one, but definitely not going to be the only one if bitcoin thrives. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 20:29:38
Hey, where did you get the data and chart from?
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:02:29
When does a transaction expire?
@_date: 2015-07-11 04:31:54
Thanks Aaron. I was thinking maybe you need to ask for seed input right after they are asked to write down the seeds(like what electrum and mycelium do). This might better prevent something like this from happening. =)  
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:45:00
F**k Apple. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 03:25:00
Exact same thing has happened to one of my transaction. Was looking for answer as well.
It has been unconfirmed for more than 12 hours.
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:40:26
Oh, didn't know Eligius is working on something like this. This would be even better if they can work it out! Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:31:15
WHY ARE YOU STILL USING OKCOIN?!
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:59:10
Just wait. U definitely won't lose your coins. It will confirm eventually. (Not sure how long, can even take one to two days.)
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:49:53
But there are tons of valid transactions in the backlog as well. There are people's transactions that have been stuck for 3 days, or even more. 
Before we found any solution to deal with spam tx, the only thing we can do is to clear all the backlog to save people like me who's been F5 'ing my tx page for two days.
@_date: 2016-02-06 01:29:30
What a shame.
Why do we always have to use Youtube?
Is there any other video hosting website?

It has way passed *technical disscussion* stage long time ago, it's more about economics, user experience, maybe the disgusting politics. 
If you are still stuck on the technical side of the discussion, you've got some serious homework to do about how the rest of the world works.
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:07:56
Why are people downvoting this?
Trying to hide the fact that the network is congested?
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:39:00
Coinbase's attention to detail never fails to amazed me. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 10:16:47
[This]( is the lighting network criticism article Gavin talks about.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:01:16
the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017?
Are you kidding me?
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:31:16
Thanks, but this is from January 2, 2015 16:40 GMT

Ah. That's sad. Sorry to hear that. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:50:16
BIP 100 adds widely-agreed/suggested 1MB floor "to the to-do list".
Guys, read the actual conversation. Look at what jg actually said.
It has just been added to the to do list. 
Nothing is implemented.
@_date: 2015-09-04 03:47:27
Sure! Let's blacklist them!

This statement is so cruel, yet so true.

Very interesting reading from Econ profs' point of view.

Thanks for keeping this Tipping Tuesday running!!!
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:22:27
Because the block is too small. Your transaction has to wait in line when there is high traffic. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:41:05
Are they already profiting so much from providing bitcoin payment processor service and exchange service,  that they can keep expanding this fast? 
Or are they just burning investors' money as fast as they can without a profiting business model, just to eat everyone else's lunch asap?
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:59:36
This is really interesting, and gives back the trust for food supplier to us.
Can someone ELI5 how this will actually work on the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-11-09 18:22:57
Really well written and brilliant foresight. 
One of my favorite articles I've read after I dived into this Bitcoin world.

You sound like "the Fed will increase the interest rate when it makes sense to do so".
@_date: 2015-11-08 06:54:50
What a brilliant and precise analogy!

@_date: 2015-03-10 15:28:20
Nobody cares.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:12:08
It is already fixed.
The patch is out.

Holy shit! This is gonna explode!

The masked man should be Satoshi, I guess?
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:21:57
You should use median instead of mean when calculating the average blocksize, since there are constant 0kb blocks getting mined which will drag down the mean even when all other blocks are at 1000kb. Hence mean here is not a good enough indicator of the actual network condition.
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:32:33
Can u put your project as well as the future development plan on Lighthouse, so that it is easier for us donating and for you to  manage. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:30:35
Blocks are being mined fine, and transactions are being processed as usual, according to 
Just the problem with BCI itself.
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:09:27
Are you planning to expand to Canada anytime soon?
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:07:07
Now it's fixed.

What is the issue is about? I'm holding part of my stash in Breadwallet. Will there be a security problem with it?

There once was a mining company named bASIC mining, which ended up a disaster.
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:55:42
Thanks for ur reply!
Can we restore it by using our seed passphrases on another iOS device?(so that it will reconnect to whatever it was trying to connect to)
What I am trying to say is that if my bitcoin was stuck and cannot be sent, does it mean my coins are stuck forever, and gone?

Thank you for your info, deweydb.
Have you finally got your fund deposited?

VirtEx has got a really bad/floppy payment process partner.

This is great! Thank u!

Lower your trading fees!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:52:45
it's 7 days, not 24 hours
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:20:59
Bcz they are too poor to hire too many employees. 
Their high trading fees scare ppl away from short-term trading at their exchange. 
No trading volume = no profit for the website.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:54:43
Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:30:51
hey mobdoc, what app are u using?
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:02:03
I heard their bank account with the big 6 was frozen?
I was afraid that i couldn't withdrawal from them using direct withdraw.
Do u mind telling me when you did ur withdrawal? and which withdraw service u used?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:15:21
This is epic!
