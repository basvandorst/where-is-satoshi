We live in a world where the only way to initiate change is to speak up loudly enough and for a long enough time. In the face of this you are saying don't speak up because the president might say no? The correct response is to speak up more if the president says no and eventually changes will come not to give up before you start. He's an example for you, when the Snowden NSA leaks began the presendent said everything the NSA was doing was fine everything was legal. Now after months of scrutanity and public outrage the president is doing a 180 and is beginning to make changes to satisfy the peoples requests. If your advice was followed where would that have lead?

I emailed them and got response from Andrea Bellemare then I got a phone call from Matt Kang for the interview.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:45:41
These events have been more of a rollercoster then investing in bitcoin... almost.
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:51:40
I think Mr. Kang also mentioned he would be doing a written article about the interview.

Too bad apple won't allow updates to the coinbase app. That feature would make the app so much more practical.

the "demo" video has no demonstration in it?
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:37:33
That article just about sums it up beside the fact that it's probably not even the real Satoshi.

Do you really think it's an error or do you think mt.gox has done this on purpose?

It's local news not fox cable news. Once in a blue-moon I stop on a local news channel while channel surfing and see something like this which reminds me why I never watch.

For the best practices in the future use the 3-2-1 rule for Back-ups:
-Make *3* back-ups,
-On at least *2* different forms of media,
-And at least *1* should be stored off site.
If you follow this your info will be safe no matter what happens,
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:33:37
Well I was referring to the latest event which is the blank site page and the released [documents showing that mt.gox was planning to change the site and deceive everyone about what has been going on.](

You mean if the "prosecution" can prove that Newsweek was neglectful?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:29:18
You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It’s just common sense.

Stating it like this shows the absurdity of their argument.

I first got in touch with them by clicking chat link on the web player page and sending them a comment

The title of this article is proof alone that 48% of Americans do **not** understand bitcoin. It assumes that the purpose of bitcoin is for investment, which any one who really "understands" bitcoins knows is not the case. If the title said something like: 
"48% of Americans understand bitcoin but still prefer old forms of property transfer" then I would believe it more.

It would prove that at least the real Satoshi is not dead. Which could also explain why he hasn't touched any coins.

I was the the lucky guy! I learned about it from this post so thank you. I just did a phone interview with the radio station that they will air later today.

Why don't they just ask "Betty"? The purpose of having a person sign their name in a correspondence is so they can be referenced and sought to verify that things were done. If they can't do that then they shouldn't be a business.
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:41:05
So after reading the article that is the message you thought important to point out?
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:08:10
What exactly are the negative consequences of being a bitcoin *"user"* living in NY state, in particular? As apposed to the negative consequences of being a bitcoin *"business"*?
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:03:16
It's working now, great and thanks. If I bump into any other issues ill let you know.

I have installed Java but the Bitmarkets app still will not run. Its stuck on the page asking me to install java?

So, if you are a business not located in NY state but at least one of your customers is from NY state then you have to abide by the BitLicense anyway?

First off, I'm hoping that English is not your first language otherwise I'm pretty sure that you are Yoda.
Now, as far as the device goes, It would have served you to do the slightest bit of investigation before posting that. Like others more politely expressed in this threat, "you are thinking it wrong." It doesn't require anything more then a 2g cell phone signal to function. It's intended to be used as a stand alone device instead of your phone and not with your phone. 
Im not saying there aren't legitimate concerns with the way this product and ecosystem work. They just aren't the ones you are talking about, Yoda. 
I know its you ;)

I have hear that they only insure the money that you put into Coinbase and not the cryto-coins? Would love to know if, in fact, they insure the crypto as well?

What town is your business located in? I live in the area and I might just have to come check the place out now that I know I can spend BTC there.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:39:55
you sound very sure about that?

Thats only about 40 min away. I'll definitely let you know

That figure is closer to 10% of customers if what I read about the banking system is true.
