You know, if you wanted to donate to Wikipedia, you could donate directly to its editors. They probably are (I am) more receptive to receiving bitcoins and will probably give some if not all their received bitcoins to Wikipedia.

To be fair the all the current drama is not about the cryptocurrency, it's about the subreddit.

Even if he's just inept, there's such thing called criminal negligence. He'd still be a criminal.

There was a recent drive by some Wikipedia editors to nominate crypto related articles for deletion on the basis that they weren't notable. They say Coindesk is a weak source and reliable sources can't be found for most of those articles....Personally, I think they are being unfairly strict about sources: they don't even take Wall Street Journal and the like because they think the mention is tangential or something like that.

Bitcoin is not backed by anything physical - it's all fueled by speculation. That might hinder bitcoin's aim of being a digital currency: who would spend bitcoins on daily necessities if bitcoins are worth 10 times more in a year? Conversely, why should a merchant take bitcoins if they could devalue quickly? Citizens should understand the risks before investing in bitcoin.
Bitcoin's role in the black market could lead it to be jointly regulated through an international effort, affecting its value. Also, as bitcoin appreciates in value, its return potential also drops while the risks increase. Speculators would then move to other virtual currencies, like the other bitcoin-like currencies already available now.
It's still too early to tell how Bitcoin would end up. But the educated youths of HK should look up to this success story and pay attention to what your friends and family need, and design a solution. Many popular technology products start out this way.

It's natural that China does not want to see a rival currency gaining ground in China. While they did not explicitly ban merchants from taking bitcoin as currency, banning financial institutions from bitcoin transactions seem to have a chilling effect on the merchants who dipped their toes in bitcoin. At least, the big Chinese companies will likely pull out to not get on the wrong side of the Chinese authorities. The small businesses that still trade in bitcoin can possibly benefit in the long run.
