Well it probably is a psychology thing because you aren't compelled to sell unless it drops ("I always lose when I sell") and you aren't compelled to buy unless it raises ("I never profit when I buy") 
Fact: the average ROI for stocks is only 7%. So if you just hodl, hopefully you can eclipse that and overcome your psychological guilt

Don't expect to make thousands of dollars but $50 is a good start

Plz don’t flame for opinion here, just giving my $.02:
Stocks do have real value as they are technically shares of ownership in a company which entitles you to dividends which have real value. The value of the company hopefully will go up over time which means the value of the stock and (hopefully) the dividends go up too.  The main similarity cryptos have to stocks is the fact that nobody can predict what will happen in the future in regards to the price of it. However, there are people who manage hedge funds, mutual funds and indices who can use past data to put together portfolios that guarantee returns. With cryptos, it’s much more difficult to figure that out because fluctuations are unpredictable and can dip 20% in minutes. If you give any person with half a brain $10,000 and tell them to invest in a.) stocks, b.) bonds and c.) cryptos for the long run, I think you’ll have a 35/60/5 split, respectively as nobody knows for certain what will happen with cryptos even 1 week from now but you get a pretty good idea with stocks and bonds
