I spend money on food, gas, utilities, rent, phone, internet, healthcare, books, journals, and bitcoin. And that's it. Maybe I'll buy something to repair my house here or there. I wasn't aware I was a deeply dumbed-down consumer drone. But I'm glad I'm now aware of the bombardment from the corporate monstrosities. I'll dig a hole in the forest somewhere and live in it to escape the bombardment - but who knows if that will give me respite from the corporations and PR firms that pervasively govern my existence.

What if the supermarket was selling food and telling the consumer that it had 100 Calories, when it actually had 1000? If I think I am eating 1000 Calories and I am eating 10000, I'll be overweight within a few weeks. This is the case in many ODs, where the drug was not at all what the user expected. However, an OD happens all at once, and the user doesn't get the chance to feel "full" on the drug before they've had far too much.

I think "spam" gets its own definition in Bitcoin terminology, just like "block height" has nothing to do with the vertical length of a bitcoin block (because it doesn't physically exist). To me, "spam" refers to frequent transactions that are smaller than the standard mining cost of 0.0001, and thus tie up miner resources. 
Consider the fee most credit card companies charge to merchants; something like 0.29% of the transaction value + $0.10. If I went to the store and made one-thousand $0.04 transactions with my credit card, the store is losing a little over $0.06 per transaction. All-in-all, it costs the store more to accept these transactions than it does to reject them; this is why some stores have something like a $5 minimum for credit card transactions. This is similar to the waste of resources that miners deal with due to bitcoin "spam" transactions.

Well, this is something I agree with. Providing user-regulated markets for drug trade, like the Silk Road, is like providing a marketplace for food, instead of only getting your food from shady food carts on the street. I still don't think the overdose is the fault of the drug user though, but some blame does shift from the dealer if the user knew precisely what they had.

Close - selling short means you have borrowed bitcoin to sell it at a certain value, in hopes you can buy it back at a lower value and take the profit. Selling coins that **you** own in hopes of buying back in at a lower price is just trading.

It is also a currency and property, alongside being a commodity. They cannot categorize it as something. Obviously it is none of the above - it is its own entity, and they need to stop trying to treat it as a bunch of other things.

It did go back to below $2 ($1.994) very very briefly on the major market at the time, Gox....and the Gox hack that drove it back to $0.01 happened before the $30 bubble. It's true it never went to 25 cents, though.

Just look at US tax paperwork vs. other countries... it's much simpler elsewhere. The US is very bureaucratic for no reason. 
The thing is these organizations can't even classify bitcoin as a currency, property, commodity, or something else... obviously, it should not just be treated as "all of the above". If the US needs to be bureaucratic about this *decentralized* cryptocurrency, they need to classify it as one "thing" - ideally, as a new "thing", a decentralized cryptocurrency, which should be regulated as such - unregulated until it comes into contact with fiat currency.

BTC-e is a solid company. Why would they shut down? They make a KILLING every single day on the volume of BTC and LTC combined with a 0.2% fee on all transactions (for example: over $8,500 just today). They have never failed in the past, and they are established. I trust them as much as any other third-party site.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:38:47
All the exchanges are P2P. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc., do not set the prices. The users of the exchanges set the prices and the exchange provides a platform for them to buy or sell.

There are also many users that are more vulnerable to coin increases doing it themselves on third party sites (i.e., traders). In this case, the exchanges kept his coins secure, while the not-until-recently-an-exchange-and-not-an-exchange-in-18-states website coinbase let this slip by (but in their defense, he didn't have Authenticor/Authy activated to protect his coins from being sent on each transaction). Just shows that some anonymously-run third-party site like btc-e has strict security practices to protect customers that even a very mainstream and registered company like Coinbase doesn't have intact. That's pretty cool, it's exactly the practices I would want these sites to have.
