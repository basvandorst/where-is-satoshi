You need the 10M version. That top prize won't be enough in a couple of years.

Hmmm....I see a chance to capitalize on "buy the dip" memes.

If you need the money in the next year, sell. But you never should have bought in the first place if that's true and you just got lucky.
If you don't need the money, HODL

You don't accept bitcoin? Can you at least promise you will re-invest all fiat proceeds into bitcoin?

Plus, an asteroid made of gold could come knock the supply totally out of whack. If inter-galactic races are sending us asteroids of rival blockchains, that's the kind of future I want to live in!

I mean max out credit cards, HODL and if it comes up tails, bankruptcy. YOLO!
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:20:35
HODL = Hold On for Dear Life. Buy and don't look back. Bitcoin is the currency of the future. Cashing out is a myth.
But I guess HofDLBaDLBBITTCoTFCOIAM is a little long for an acronym.

I'll make it easy for you: give me your bitcoin today and hen in a year when it has doubled, I'll give you back half as much.

When has censorship ever worked? The beauty of crypto is that you can't censor it. Such a dumb move!

Whelp, one more place that won't hire me.

Real, fake, it doesn't matter. Just HODL people!

Their own shareholders could sue them. Their idiotic statements reflect poorly on their companies and hurt shareholder value and so also the stock price.
So find some people that own the stock and they would have a good case for destruction of value.

As far as I'm concerned, I don't care. If you HODL, all this does is give you a dip where you can buy a little more than normal this month.
"Buy the rumor sell the news" while I'm over here HODLing

Hodl doge my man.

Hey, if the price keeps climbing I'll have enough to start a climate change foundation and retire early.
Heck, we should make a pledge here and now - 10% of our BTC to climate change in 25 years. Imagine what that amount of wealth would do to solve the problem!
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:36:36
The same thing that has been happening for several years?
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:53:03
I've never been charged an overdraft fee when using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:16:45
FUD much?
But I mean yeah, the price can crash. It can also go up 4x. Based on recent data, which do you think is more likely?
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:43:30
Well let's see - 1k to 4k so far this year. So if we get nothing else, that is 16k in 2018, 64k in 2019, &gt;100k in 2020. So how about 3 years?
Oh yeah, unless the curve is really exponential. In which case probably like tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:33:56
Good for him. Don't you think people in Venezuela wished that they had a currency that was immune to shenanigans? If nothing else, that right there is why we need bitcoin - to keep government from being able to make money worthless.

What a bunch of idiots. Please post this over there. It's worth the ban.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:42:04
What do you expect when something has roughly doubled in value every 3 months lately? LOL markets aren't that stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:42:29
earn more monies :).
Invest now, use new monies later to invest more.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:27:16
Who cares? China presented a nice dip to buy; I doubt the majority of people could pick out Malaysia on a map (and they certainly can't find the missing airline). Buy and HODL people, buy and HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:24:59
Invest now. If the price goes down, invest more. If the price goes up, HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:34:48
Lol and who do you think is going to report the transactions if you don't? It's a brave new world out there - we aren't government slaves anymore.
