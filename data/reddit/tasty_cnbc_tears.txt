The exchanges all know who is responsible.  Nobody is making them provide data.
I do not want regulation.  I want a mechanism to stop these parasites.  Is it even possible to have a world where everyone actually gives a fuck about everyone else instead of having the largest home?
Our world is a fucking disaster and it's getting worse.

Downvote away.  I've been here 2013 and I've never been wrong.
I'm not quite as bright as Luke, Mr. Maxwell or Mr Wuille.
I am, however, ahead of you in the game of life.

Ok, genius.  You are not a good person.
The only people who can move the market are the "ancients" or the new money.
The new money is trying to suck money from everyone else.
It's how it's supposed to work?  Do you understand that people have attempted for nearly a decade to utilize traditional frameworks for bitcoin whether it be TA frameworks, etc and it has never applied?
You need to check your ego at the door, motherfucker.  Your rules no longer work here.

It's funny how when I tried to tell everyone for years as I was ridiculed and banned.
Not so funny anymore is it?

I say the exchanges know who is responsible and get down voted.  Yes, It's magic.  Nobody knows who is running bots and what bank accounts they use.  Fucking magic.  Idiots.

Oh, you have .5 bitcoin.  Now you are an authority?
Fuck off.
