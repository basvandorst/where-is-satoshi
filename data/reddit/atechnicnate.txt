So in order to insure my transaction I have to pay a fee and/or use someone with a trade history. Both of those methods rely on a neutral third party in between the transaction.  How does using bitcoin in that scenario improve anything for me vs. using a credit card?

I think the difference here is that HSBC was complicit but only through ignorance.
In the case of Shrem they say they have evidence of him having knowledge of the wrong doing and still participating.  Therefore, he was an active participant and facing jail time vs. just being fined.
Typically in the case of alcohol you can be fined for them doing something stupid as a result of you over serving them.  However, if they commit murder you aren't an accomplice.
Anyway, I think we're basically saying the same thing.

It's not just address verification but also a type of security/reversible transactions.  I'm not ignorant to the fact that what we currently have is flawed but I don't believe that a crypto currency exchange with no recourse for bad transactions is the answer either.

I'm glad someone posted this so I didn't have to.  The cases are really quite different.

Silk road isn't selling to the average person in the public.  Rating systems are great but there again you rely on a 3rd party system to decide if you trust the other person or not.  Once it gets in to large transactions it makes it harder for me to say "Sure, I'll send you $1,000 for that and hope you send it to me because you have 5 stars."  
Although, to be fair, ebay started much like this but eventually they too needed a middleman.

There was a law passed about a year ago that makes a fee legal now.  It's often called a convenience fee and not a processing fee.

In this case from what I've just read the problem is that Shrem was aware someone he was working with was involved in the drug trade and continued to work with him:

However, HSBC had it happening without their knowledge but they should have recognized it and were lax on sanctions.

I don't think that's true and the reason being is that I don't trust people.  I wouldn't, at this time, pay some end user on ebay in bitcoins because if he scams me then I can't get the money back and I'm hosed.
The major underlying issue with bitcoin (and also a huge asset) is that addresses aren't verified and thus there's zero recourse if you get scammed.  Once that's fixed then you lose anonymity but gain security.  Anyway, this is a half thought out rant as I'm doing other stuff.  I don't like Paypal's policies and they certainly bully people a lot but I do see the need for some sort of "middle man" in online transactions to cover my arse from devious people.

Quick sell, lock in that loss!

Ah gotcha.  Typically in bankruptcy cases I've seen trustee's just liquidate stuff as fast as they can without giving a crap about value.  Then they take whatever little bit is there and pass it out.  I didn't realize this guy was supposed to get value because that's not what trustee's I've previously seen do.

While I understand what you mean by not in their best interest I'd also imagine that he's not a specialist in trading/crypto etc.  So what he did is probably exactly what I would have done a few months ago.  Place an order, let it finish and be done with it.  He stands to gain nothing from using more of his time to try and milk for more.

From what I understand he sold them for what was the value at the moment he clicked sell.  I don't get why people are so angry that he's selling coins if he was told to.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:15:35
So he just placed a sell order at a set price and waited for that to be filled or was he selling slowly in small batches at lower and lower prices?

I watched a few Mongolian soldiers do this to each other when I was deployed with them.  Those dudes are scary...
