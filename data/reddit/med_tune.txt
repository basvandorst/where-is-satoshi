Yes, true. Lose not loose. Thank you.

Yes, very big numbers, and technical issues. I think that if they want to be in the business they have to have the necessary means to maintain the stability of the service.

Sir, I am a developer and computer savvy, their email is not something I can miss. I am using Kraken for more than year and a half, and I know the rules for the confirmation emails for new addresses. I confirm that I have not received their confirmation email, and I have stated that in the support ticket I have sent.
You can find users with the same issue on:

It's true that not all users have issues with Kraken, but they can have them sooner or later. I haven't had any serious issues with Kraken in the past, and I really liked it.
If you take a look at  you will see that so many users have very simar issues.

That's what I thought when I wasn't able to place orders, but when I took a look at r/KrakenSupport/ and saw how many people are having same problem, I understood the situation. My account is verified, and haven't received any email or any notification from them telling me that my account is locked. It doesn't sound normal, but from their part.

He's not my uncle either. QuadrigaCX has a very good reputation, good luck with it!
Kraken has to fix it's service technical issues. My account is verified, and I traded on Kraken so many times in last year, then I moved to Bitfinex, because I thought that fees were somewhat higher.
