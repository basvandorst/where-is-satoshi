Well.  He's spent his life both entertaining people and fighting injustice, and now he's encouraging them to learn about the counter-economy that can finally free them from the global banker's enslavement.  
Some people might consider that meaningful.  And by some people, I mean everyone who's not a slack-jawed moron.

I don't think you know what those words mean.

wow.  that's a really stupid thing to say.

no thanks, i'll just keep mining and wait for the rest of the world to catch up.

This is correct.  But with the US dollar constantly inflating, eventually some of these companies must start holding BTC.  Then, the Moon.  
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:11:15
brilliant retort.  have fun in those economics, finance, and public policy classes.

these statements are banking on the idea that BTC will replace the petrodollar as the global reserve currency, in which case each whole bitcoin will be worth ~$2.66million in today's dollars.  so those who own hundreds of BTC will be billionaires and those who own thousands will be trillionaires.  currently there are a lot of millionaires, not very many billionaires, and maybe only 1 or 2 families that control trillions of dollars worth of assets.  we can expect to see a similar distribution of wealth.

i cashed all my LTC out at $20 - scored a few BTC from it, since the exchange rate was .04 at the time.

go back to no one here takes you seriously.

we'll see how they fair when the dollar is worthless. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:54:12
maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  it most certainly was in a bubble when the price hit $1200 last year.  is that when you bought in? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:55:48
people don't take bitcoin seriously?  oh, you mean people who haven't heard of it.  because once you hear about it, you start asking questions, once those questions get answered, you understand that it's the future of money.  i don't need to try to convert people to a faith in the almighty bitcoin, i understand how revolutionary it is, and that it will do to paper money what google did to the phone book.  therefore, i don't care what laws are made for or against the protocol, because one day bitcoin will render the governments that wrote those laws totally obsolete.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:47:36
you know about money, but went all in on a very high risk investment when it was in a bubble.  interesting.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:21:03
oh man you really hurted my feeelings.  i'm sorry i said anything, you're really really really smart, and you won the debate, just don't hurt my poor little feeelings anymore, okay? 
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:02:41
that's pretty much the same thing i just said:  the market price for an item is whatever people at large are willing to pay for the item.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:12:07
and yet, despite all these advances, the price is 1/3 what it was last year.  but, somehow, it wasn't in a bubble back then.  go home, troll. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:40:36
if the market demands exchange via a certain medium, the market's demands will be answered.  businesses that refuse to meet the markets needs will die.  unless, of course, the state decides to make the market's demands illegal... 
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:09:32
if you think this is just about following the rules you clearly have no understanding of just how much crypto will rock the foundation of our society and economy.  
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:37:40
No one knows if it will die completely or go to the moon.  People have their beliefs, but no one knows.  You could be an extremely wealthy person in the coming decades, or you could be throwing that $19,000 down the sink.  No one knows.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:52:44
once again, that's an incredibly stupid thing to say.  have you read the source code?  are there no unforeseen hacks or glitches that we're not aware of because the technology is only a few years old?  can you see the future?  will the governments of the world allow the spread of bitcoin to continue, or will they have the ISP's shut down the protocol?  will the financial institutions implement a bitcoin clone that becomes worth more than bitcoin itself?   if you can't see any risks you're either a troll, or the dumbest person on this subreddit.  
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:25:18
One reason the current financial industry is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second is because they all use modern mainframes.  Could someone ELI5 whether or not Bitcoin could be mined more efficiently on a modern mainframe, or at least have full nodes running on them? 
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:09:47
i would never spend this much money on a bong.  but some people will.  since people are willing to spend $500 on a bong, $500 is a reasonable price for this item.  i thought this was a sub full of economists... 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:41:46
It's not worthless - you can buy practically anything with USD right now - it's just undergoing inflation, and will likely be worth less than it is right now in the future.

nano gets alot of hate.  to a n00b the controls are more intuitive than vi though.  
@_date: 2015-08-21 18:37:12
I agree that they aren't genuinely interested in the currency, but banks are most certainly interested in blockchain technology.  They have a chance to cut their overhead costs drastically by switching away from centralized mainframes and distributing their ledger.  
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:30:23
It's great that now only 1 side of the debate may be heard on @_date: 2015-07-12 19:37:13
Yeah, but, the cartoon is obviously about the banks, not Bitcoin.  Seriously, how could you possibly think this was about Bitcoin?

no, he committed suicide when gox fell.
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:20:07
I agree.  No way Satoshi is just a guy - "He" is actually a team of programmers hired by DARPA or the global banking cartels - Bitcoin is their exit strategy for when the Dollar tanks.  I bet everything on it.  
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:09:41
You're so right.  Digital things aren't real things.  The internet isn't real, we aren't really talking right now.  You're a genius.  
@_date: 2015-11-15 03:23:12
Banks make a ton of money off cross border transaction fees.  The banks won't just die overnight, Bitcoin has to out compete them in every service they provide.

One of the few reasons I like living Louisiana is it's one of the states that allows private transfers of firearms without an FFL or paperwork.  You can't buy like this from a pawn shop, gun store, or gun show, but I can get on facebook and buy an AR-15 from a total stranger right now.
