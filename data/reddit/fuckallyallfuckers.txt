Didn't read the article as it's probably shit and wrong - but if 1% of Bitcoin transactions are used for illegal transactions I'll eat my dick on live TV.
That would mean &gt;100 M dollars a day and that would be equal to the total revenue of Silk Road during its operation (3 years) every 15 days.

I suspect he's putting pressure on whomever he's blackmailing. Imagine what would happen if the bcash and bitcoin gold on the old addresses start to move...

I am the John McAfee you write of. Yes, it is me. You are not being fooled. You are even reading this in my voice.

If you understand the technological aspects of PoW it's worth a read. Made me stop and think.

And that's where we differ in opinions. Yes, Bitcoin probably never will be private by default, but it will be possible to perform confidential transactions.
Do you encrypt your emails? SMTP is plain text by default. It shouldn't be, and wouldn't be if it was redesigned from scratch, but case and point;

How did BCH lose its credibility? Coinbase suck dick and BCHs scaling solution is equal to cutting your dick and ass off to get into a pair of jeans you don't fit instead of fasting/losing weight, but what does Coinbase's fuckup have to do with BCH?

You either have faith in the protocol or you don't.

Except, no one who is privacy-oriented will reuse an adress. Add LN and CT on top of that and the use case for XMR is to fill the gap for another year.

It was good in the sense that it increased the demand for fiat-traded cryptos. All in all, though, it's all temporary hurdles and the enemy is yourself; believe in what you've invested inyo, else gtfo.

Yes, make sure you're unable to move your coins so OPs losses are mitigated.

Smart people are taking advantage of dumb people. I'm making good money on this. Short the market, buy back on Sunday. 500-1000% ez depending on the gamble you do.
