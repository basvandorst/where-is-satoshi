Voting rights: The only chain it will negatively impact is the one that forked. Dont think Eth is developing their blockchain to be optimized for forks. 
Big exchange: The hacker would need to steal 50 million ether, and risk staking it...if they had that much money, they would be sitting up there with Jeff Bezos at $80B. Furthermore, one exchange does not hold 50+ million tokens.

Whats wrong with hybrid system? Isnt the plan to use hybrid system only in the near term as PoS moves out of its proof of concept phase?

Theres a mix of both. Read smeggletoot comments above. 
Both nonetheless, youre mostly correct. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:47:54
Letting supply and demand solely determine interest rates is an interesting concept, though extremely prone to extremely damaging bubbles.

I struggle with understanding whether Bitcoin evangelists want transparency or anonymity.

Whats millions in eth going to do to the billions staked in eth? Is the eth foundation going to hack their own system?

I know...but were talking about raising capital here. Some people need to borrow money to fund good ideas. Theyre is no other way to do it other than some form of debt or some form of equity or both.

Can you elaborate?
Giving a loan of, lets say, 1000BTC. How would I benefit from the cost of money in this situation?

I was backwards in my previous comment....
Deflation hurts the borrower. Lets say you pay 5% interest plus an unpredictable deflationary factor of another 10%. 15+% of total cost to borrow. Well...lets say the currency inflates 10% instead. Then its risk to the loaner. 
It is adding a higher risk premium due to instability to loans. Not good.

I like you and i think you bring up some great points i havent heard before. 
My final question is...why Bitcoin? 
Why do you think its going to be 
money payment adoption-&gt; blockchain adoption
rather than:
Blockchain adoption -&gt; money payment adoption
In essence, why do you think ethereum isnt going to work as well?
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:07:28
That sets a pace for high volatility and, eventually, bubbles.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:19:16
Right but eventually, after the number of loans that resulted in a negative return due to crypto volatility, loaners are going to demand a higher rate to offset that continued risks. Again...all boils down to mathematics.

What current ledgers are cheated? Automation just enables banks to have better margins. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:47:15
Cryptos dont replace banks. If you think the only way banks make money is via transaction fees, you might need to do a little more research...

Well, in my opinion, ETH's marketing antics, as you might call it, could be the primary driver for actual use cases for its platform. Bitcoin has been built from the ground up as a peer-to-peer payment system, while Ethereum is a Turing complete worldwide virtual machine. Despite ETH taking a traditional marketing approach, it has a number of reputable organizations in its alliance, helping it build its architecture to mold into practical use cases. Meanwhile, bitcoin is in the crosshairs of scrutiny and driven by unsubstantiated hype, rightfully so given some of the terrible organizations it funds. 
You can be the best thing around, but positioned very poorly. Btc might be the wise old man but, then again, eth also might be the disruptive innovator.

Individual people will create interest rates based on whats best for them. Not what is best for the economy. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:07:16
If I was an app developer interested in using blockchain, why would I go to Bitcoin's blockchain over Ethereum's?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:24:48
Why would i lend money for an interest rate at 10% a year when, if i hold onto it, i will gain 15% a year. Technically, since supply is limited, you would want to drive supply of loans with inflation...which is one of the many reasons moderate inflation is good. 
For everyone preaching about deflation, please google "why inflation is good" 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:18:30
Are you insinuating we should completely deleverage our economy? Do you understand the implications of that? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:25:47
I get jt...i know what blockchain is. But Bitcoin is not a smart contract platform. It is build from the ground up to be a currency for anti-establishment enthusiasts with a main purpose of sticking-it-to-corporations. 
As the other comment mentioned, it could be used for peer-to-peer lending. If thats the case, who sets interest rates? Who has the time to seek a good credit candidate with a solid business plan? Wouldnt that still be a bank? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:06:01
Thats not true at all. They are required to hold a minimum reserve. Theyll receive $10 and only allowed $7 in loans.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:46:00
There is infinite competition right now....increasingly stabilized by the fed rate. And there are still bubbles. So what do you mean?
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:10:05
If the price of something has a standard deviation, you can apply a risk premium to it. Dont think this would be some form of an exception unless you could somehow disprove mathematics.

Comments like this make me wonder if people on this sub actually have an idea of how to get to where they think Bitcoin is going. 
Banks will continue to exist....in fact they might have even more control. Without a central bank to set interest rates, who do you think is going to hike rates to unsustainable levels, or on the contrary, lower rates to unsustainable levels.
