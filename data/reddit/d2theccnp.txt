They can't dethrone the dollar. The USA is the largest customer. The USA pays in dollars.

Yea, I can't understand why countries and business insist on hard currency for payment. It's a conspiracy!

You think the USA "hacked" venezuela's currency printer, increased their money supply by 10,000%, causing the world's highest inflation?

It's called Nordic **Capitalism** for a reason.

Why would the US care? The US is venezuela's largest trading partner.

Yea, the country with no food. Brilliant.

Bitcoin can't work in Venezuela, because the power grid barely works.

The banks do not print money in Venezuela. The government does. -

We suggest the opposition which was chosen by 67% of Venezuelans - 
Reality sucks don't it?

Something tells me you don't have source for the imaginary "blockade.""
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:26:33


Well, the USA is their largest customer, and the USA pays exclusively in dollars.

Nah, let them continue starving, like they have been for 9 years.

Social democracy no more socialist than social media.

The current exchange rate is $1 = 410,000 BsF. 
Minimum wage and food stipends cover about 800,000 BsF **per month**. Socialism is a helluva drug.

Not usable though. You need a functioning power grid. Venezuela is too far gone for that
