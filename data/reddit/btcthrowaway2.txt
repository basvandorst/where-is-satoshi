I just cashed out a couple at $1150 and ordered a sweet ass gaming rig to replace my 6 year old relic of the past. My first splurge from btc profit, thought I deserved a gift after making the best decisions of my life this year :)

lmao, love the edit. But goddamn, I searched all over for something like snapcard. Couldn't find anything that looked reputable.
Edit: By "searched all over" I mean I googled for 5 min and got bored.

I'm sure I'll love it, I'm coming from a q6600.

I too wish they did, I got everything except my case there, it was sold out. Then again, I would lose out on a ton of Amazon store credit from their card lol, double edged sword.
As a side note, I ordered the case on Amazon early Saturday, with Prime, and it came today! Very weird, I've never gotten a delivery on Sunday before.

awwww yeeees
 (the one that already arrived lol)
The original plan was to get everything from amazon for prime and the 3x reward points (&gt;$50 total) but them mofos added $137 in taxes! Mighty strange move, considering a huge reason amazon got big was because they didn't have taxes. Well, always glad to give newegg my business. Ordered my current pc there on 12/14/2007, so it only seems natural lol.

So this *just* became a thing, and it already happened to me? huh

I happen to know Yifu irl and I can tell you guys that his intentions are good, he wants to ensure bitcoin adoption in the US. I just don't think he's thought this through very well. Ultimately this will be decided by whether companies decide to join in, which I think/hope won't happen.

Don't be, I now have to constantly look behind my shoulder. Too many good things have been happening in quick succession, somethin's fishy.
