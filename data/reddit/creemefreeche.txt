That problem is not specific to cryptos. In fact I believe some refer to that as simply the "human problem"

I'm sceptical. I think the price fall was in part due to people losing faith in bitcoin because of its massive scaling problems. People are buying back in now because it was cheaper than it had been in a while, and they think this is their last chance to buy at a "good price". 
Markets like this will always have a rebound after a dip because so many people have been waiting to buy. I believe it's a bit too late for bitcoin and we will see superior tech take over the market. It appears people aren't aware of this, or they do not agree with me. Either way I have my portfolio split across btc and alts so I'm just here to watch the new year fireworks.

I dunno why we're downvoting the guy that talked about basically half of the content of that picture. If OP didn't want to spark a discussion about rum then why put the captain in the pic!?

Who says it's very hackable?
The cautious among us store our bitcoins in cold storage, making it harder to hack than most online banking apps

Looks neat. If I contribute will I be able to sell these tokens on any exchanges in the future?  Or will they really just be for music purchases on opus?

They probably didn't create the game itself, they're just manipulating the deposits and withdrawals system in their own site.

You lose any profit as soon as you trade your btc for fiat :&lt;
Btc is profit
Btc is money!

That Google search correlation is interesting. Makes you wonder which rises first, price or interest levels

So I bought my first few mbtc about a week ago on bitstamp.net. Verification required a scan of an ID card and proof of address, it took maybe 2-3 days to clear. Bank deposit took about 24 hours and the bitcoin purchase at market rate was instant.
Only complaint is that the bank account is a European one and payment has to be done in euros. This means it takes 1-3 days to clear payments and you're subject to non standard currency charges.
All in all I'm happy with the service though. 
*edit: since you're saying you want to buy 4btc I'm not sure what the limits are, but I deposited 1000 euros first time of asking without any issues 
**second edit: it's bitstamp.net nowadays.

I bookmarked the exchange site Bitstamp in my Web browser a few years ago but didn't want to send my identity documents to sign up. The heading still reads "btc: $284"

Given the full stop at the end of the sentence I'd assume no other punctuation was missing...

Bitcoin = savings account
Fiat = necessary stopgap
Then eventually Litecoin or other fast transaction globally accepted crypto = debit card

I made an account to buy some ethereum, and had no idea what I was getting into.
I deposited too much, lost a load just withdrawing the excess funds and triggered a sell clause before I really wanted to sell. Basically I didn't know what I was doing and paid a pretty high price. 
I thought it was more like an exchange but you do not have access to the coins in question so I wouldn't trust it really. If you're investing in cryptos you should own the coins yourself.

Comparing bitcoin to tulip bulbs (in the 17th century no less) is absurd to begin with.
Tulip bulbs literally grow in the ground, and there is no fixed limit to the number of bulbs. There also would have been little to no communication regarding the price of the bulbs in different areas, whereas we have multiple exchanges with rapid access to market information.
Also saying someone could hack the blockchain and create more bitcoins is absolutely ridiculous. Sure, people can hack exchanges as has happened in the past, but why not just say that..?
^ saying this also undermines the "potential uses of blockchain tech" that the journalist introduced earlier in the article.
Forbes spreading FUD, disregard and/or use as a tool to educate yourselves for when more convincingly-veilled anti-btc arguments arise.

My main qualms are with his lack of impartiality, calling it "dangerous lunacy" or similar, and then his insistence that people follow his lead "buy at $1800". 
I think the most credible financial speculation allows the reader to make their own investment decisions

It's a complete guess by an uninformed user.
At least that is what you should assume on Reddit. Or basically anywhere else where people are trying to predict Bitcoin price.
This doesn't mean you shouldn't enter the market. I think basically anyone who does enough research about the technology itself would agree that it holds an inherent value. Just try and avoid getting sucked in by FUD, and certainly disregard random price predictions by uninformed users.
