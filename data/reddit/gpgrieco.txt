A typo when you created the password or when you typed it in?

It has value because people are willing to pay for it.

People need to keep their coins in their own wallet, not leave them on an exchange until it disappears with them. That is the first problem. 
Also people need to make up their mind what they want. Everyone says they want an untraceable unregulated currency that no one would know what they have or how much. On the other hand, the second something goes wrong everyone wants others to step in and regulate it so that doesn't happen. If you want to deal in such a currency there will be risks and there is nothing you can do about it. If bitcoin becomes a regulated currency you might as well just use cash or check for all your transactions.

At least you didn't just delete it and leave everyone wondering "What did he say?"

The day before yesterday I was going to sell what I had, and re-buy when it went back down. I regret that decision now.

Thank you for the insight.

Yes well I predicted it would go up a little more, then I would sell. And I expected this crash to happen, just not so soon. So yea, my psychic abilities are a little off.

If BTC dropped to $0 tomorrow and I lost my investment it won't mean I'm not going to eat or anything like that. Getting the BTC I have into cash will just make a few things much easier. I am not going to make any decisions based on anyone saying yes sell or no hold on for a few weeks unless they have evidence to back up their theory, such as said further down.

When I bought I didn't plan on needing it. I also expected it to keep rising. My thinking was that once it hit $1000 it was making all the mainstream news sources all over the world. I figured that would cause people to try to get in on it, and as more and more people bought it would continue to go up. I think that happened, but it was offset by people selling once it hit $1000. Not necessarily people that were investing but people that had a wallet they forgot about, just decided to cash out. It was almost like found money for a lot of people.

Honestly, I'd rather have a white castle in my area then have them accept bitcoins for payment.
