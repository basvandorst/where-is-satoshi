Wat? That's 4/3.

I've already realized that I'd probably be better off hodling, but for some reason I never take the safe, easy path. Apparently I subconsciously enjoy mental agony.

Yup, I've started moving my assets from Gdax there.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:09:17
I've been doing that most of the day.

Depends on if youre investing or trading. If investing, hodl. If trading, do it in baby steps at first and analyze every outcome. I've lost quite a bit of gains from making mistakes when trading, but I've learnt from it. For example, I've sold to cut losses in fiat, but it dawned on me that fiat is completely irrelevant and that I should only sell if it gives me the opportunity to buy more bitcoin. Still, I have plenty to learn, so I might be giving bad advice.

If I did that, the FOMO goblin would probably keep me awake.

Would be good to know. I was a real cheapskate and my transaction from my Mycelium wallet to GDAX has been stuck for five days.

I have the same problem, if not worse. I'm spending a lot of time at the computer checking the market and reading related stuff lately, instead of spending time with the family or doing household chores. On the other hand I'm currently making more profit on this than at work, so I kinda see it as a second job. Then again, anything could happen when I sleep and everything could be lost when I wake up, so I've spent a couple of nights awake worrying or daydreaming. I guess it won't be healthy in the long run.

I'm not sure that we're talking about the same kind of hodling. No fees involved.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:13
Don't worry. It'll be alright and you'll be a stronger person.

I feel ya. I bought BTC about a year ago and hodled, mostly forgetting about it. Then when the big rush hit I started thinking that if I had kept investing and trading back then I would have been able to pay off our entire house loan by now. So now I've been learning the ropes and already done my fair share of mistakes, but none too bad. I see it as expensive lessons that will ultimately make me better at trading. Still, it's hard to go to sleep some nights, not knowing what might hit the fan while I sleep.

Is there anything I can do if I've set the transaction fee too low? I have a transaction that's been stuck for more than a week with 0 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:25:50
Ah, faith. I wish I had that. Not that it would help much if it turned out to be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:45:39
Well in that case, aren't you hodling?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:32:32
Do you have a bedtime routine? Do you lie awake at night fearing a dip/correction/crash/spike/rally? Or do you just sleep well and HODL tight with an iron fist? Do you place a stop limit order in the evening or set up any kind of alarms or notifications for market changes? How do you get through the night in exciting times like these?
