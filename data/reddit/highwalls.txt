Hey Hi!
This just began today. If you look at the older posts from you'll see that he was trying to convince me to accept Bitcoin, and I was refusing initially. (I didn't knew that he's cross posting it to Reddit, wtf)
So, this is a trial of Bitcoin for this Business. (I know Gyft is doing well, and making $$$ but I'd like to know how it works for another business - comparatively newer)
I can assure you that the cards are legit and of full value. If you don't get them within 48 hours for whatever reasons, we'll return 100% money back.
If you have more questions, let me know.

**Thank you**, I hope to see you convert into a customer. :)
Let me know if you face any problem.

Well, all I can say is to try it yourself. Got only 2 orders so far, delivered both.

Yes, it uses a .ga domain name.
About SSL certificate. It's the RedHat OpenShift SSL Certificate. A new certificate will be issued for the domain soon anyways. 
Also, the payments are ALWAYS over SSL, because both Coinbase and Coinpayments.net forces them.

If you look at some blog posts of reputed sites, you'll be see people claiming bitcoin is cheat in the comments section. The Bitcoin community do loves it, but not anyone else. That's the problem. 
I am running this still for 1 week because I want to know if people REALLY have interest in Gift cards with great discounts. That's all.
I can't really ask the board and team members to add Bitcoin if I can't give them proof that it is desirable for the Business.
I promise if this gets some volume of gift-cards, I'll ask them to add Bitcoin to main store and then redirect this site on the main one.
Moreover, this site uses Wordpress because this is a test. The main store using custom-built CMS and will be using Bitpay for Bitcoin payments (if this goes well).
