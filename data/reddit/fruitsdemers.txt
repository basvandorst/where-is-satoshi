I'm sure they would.
They would certainly be benefiting from that much much more than the victims they would represent, or the community they would surely claim to protect.

That's true but at this point, I feel more press of this flavor is immediately detrimental to the value of what little bitcoin I have left outside of gox versus whatever I can realistically see myself get from such a suit. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one licking wounds right now but I still have enough to lose. 
Any other day, I would frankly be all for suing the everliving shit out of mk out of the principle and tip the lawyer that brought him down with a generous sum afterwards. Just not today.

Most of them allow returns on a individually-decided basis in order to leave a good impression on the 95% of the people who have legitimate reasons for returning an item. 
But if you read the policies of the stores that are famous for allowing returns, you'll find that they usually write in draconian requirements like the item needing to still be sealed and none of the items showing any sign of wear otherwise charging a substantial restocking fee all so that they actually have grounds to reject returns from people who obviously abuse it for personal gain, like cherry picking cpus for the best overclockers and returning everything else because my dog ate my other motherboards.

1. It was allegedly committed by external hackers.
2. Most of the technical details about the security measures on any money exchange aren't exactly public knowledge but it should be said that mt.gox had been found to be comically incompetent multiple times before the most recent events.
3. If there were hastily patched up ordinances about cryptocurrencies in place, I'm pretty sure it would be the Japanese authorities involved in this.
4. No one knows for sure but mt.gox claims to have noticed over a long period of irregular withdrawal issues. They must have uncovered it on their own because the amount stolen made it bleeding obvious but not known how to deal with it.
5. Probably now in cold storage waiting for the price to go back up. Due to the nature of bitcoins, the chances of recovering them are not looking so good. Nothing short of someone doing major internet detective work (which would only work if the thieves make a laughable mistake like bragging about it on facebook) followed by actual physically meeting and convincing the thieves to return the funds would do much. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:29:31
That glitch happens fairly often and pisses me off because when the price is sliding, I can end up with a loss with no way to make up for it. 
That said, you can't make any withdrawals with a negative balance on any type of coins and you would have to zero it out in order to withdraw even coins that are unrelated to the pair you were trading on so there's no way to cheat the system from that.

I've also got a transaction, albeit much smaller stuck because bitcoin qt sometimes doesn't ask me for the fees.
Incidentally, I also have a transaction with the 0.0002 fee that's also sitting unconfirmed after close to 6 hours now not even showing up on blockchain.info but showing up in all the other blockchain explorer and coinbase... Weird things happen.

I stand corrected; I pulled my figure on the top of my head after skimming this headline a while back: 
Though just to nitpick in the only field you've referred to that I'm vaguely familiar with, 37% might believe that global warming is a hoax but that's a subset of the 43% who believe that mankind isn't able to change the earth's climate and that is also probably an overlapping set with the much larger portion of our voterbase who believe that short term economic spur is far more important than the long term viability of our planet as our host.

It hasn't been very successful so far though and the last thing they would want is to take an adversarial stance with bitcoins when they're really not getting close to touching the real competition they should be worried about.
If anything, I expect them to embrace cryptocurrencies and conquer the electronic currency handling market through an opening in the niche corner.

I did watch the video.
This would make bitcoin transactions 20 times easier and probably inspire a lot more confidence into first time users trying to buy something with btc.
It's also easily integrated into the current commercial encryption methods and would allow etailers easily make a 2-step payment that not only provides a confirmation receipt but also enable a automatized refund process if needed.
This would be a tremendously good thing for the BTC ecosystem if it could take off and become ubiquitous.

Okay sure, that's ironic. But that being one instance makes it ironic in the same way that saying Ghengis Khan being notorious for pillaging is ironic over the anecdote that he did also denounce some other tribes of Mongolian barbarians for pillaging in his name is ironic. 
They could have called their award anything they wanted but they chose to incrust themselves on the prestige of the Nobel prize against the will of the Nobel family and now some of them are throwing the weight of that title around and ranting against bitcoins as if his shady award were associated with the philanthropic reputation of the real deal, which not enough people know that it isn't.

Everyone should also take 10 minutes off and look up what the Nobel Prize in economics really is, an artificially crafted tool for making appeals to authority to influence the market. 
It was made by bankers for bankers, despite the protest of the Nobel family's protests and going against the will and spirit of Alfred Nobel's foundation.

I still see people everyday who are afraid that they if they sneeze in the wrong direction, they can lose all their bitcoins or that if their transaction isn't going through after 20 minutes, a hacker has infiltrated his computer and taken his money.

Your analogy is poor.
A more accurate one would be that saying that the protocol is secure but mt.gox wasn't is like saying that keeping your cash in a safe is secure because the safe itself is intrinsically infallible to attempts to breaking it open but that you could be trusting an incompetent/malicious man using such a safe to keep your money who might leave the safe opened in a public location or lose your personal id and pin code to open it or steal your money himself.
