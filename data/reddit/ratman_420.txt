Since I'm in Finance the appeal of a decentralized currency really appealed to me. But I don't think anybody could of expected this sort of growth in such a short amount of time

I actually have not sold anything yet. I'm waiting until next Sept so the IRS will tax me less, since I bought more crptos earlier this year.

I have Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin. I also got Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold due to the forks, I did not buy those two.

I thought to myself "this quote looks familiar."
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:32:56
That's true, there's still approx. 6 million available correct?
