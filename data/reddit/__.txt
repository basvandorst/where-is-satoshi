youre right he did say, my mistake. I think your statistic is still shouldnt be described as common sense. Coinbase frequently updates their site with warnings of delayed or backlogged transactions, it would seem like common sense would indicate if its widespread enough to issue statements and warnings about then it would be lower than 99.99% I mean at one point they were telling users to not even use wire transactions, you think they would do this if they were operating at 99.99% smooth transactions?

I was doing a withdraw, no issues in any info, just coinbase taking forever. I don't know why people are arguing this, they admit it themselves.

I think its sad to use profit to determine how good a coin is. Unless you think ecoin is amazing. Well its not sad it just doesnt make sense.

Go to it's filled with posts of missing wires. My 10k withdraw from December 12 just came through a few days ago.

He's not saying it's a fraud, he's saying you are pulling shit out of your ass, they never defrauded me but 2 of my transactions were delayed for over a month on coinbase, doesn't make them a scam, just means they don't run smoothly.

Bitcoin is certainly not a zero sum game, why do you think it is?
