Not us, we aren't behind this letter in particular.
We are behind the other ones but we've since received a DMCA notice and our site has been disabled.

True, but I should have given him some alternatives on how he could have released the information in a protected manner.

Doesn't change the fact that our reporting is accurate and they are merely trying to silence us.
We stand by what we wrote, the claims made are real and if we are taken to court over them we can deliver ample proof that what we stated is the truth.
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:50:13
It would be so costly for them to do that. It seems a stretch that they would spend that much money to subvert Bitcoin when other bans and restrictions could prevent mainstream adoption (it wouldn't stop it but would certainly hamper it for a while).
@_date: 2014-06-21 05:34:51
This is going to be a serious issue as Facebook only allows you to have 2,500 friends maximum. After that they are followers and you can invite via a wall post but you can't actually invite them using the Invite feature unless they are "fans".

Keep in mind that a lot of people are lazy about such things or when people are asked for an email address they assume it will come with spam.
I know those seem like invalid reasons but lots of people don't want to trade off email for the possibility of spam and many people don't want to take the time to remember the name of the site, go to the site, fill out a form, give over banking information and what not just for ten dollars.
Plenty of people do though. It is certainly interesting. Do you think it is an image issue with Bitcoin or something else?

I pay $20 additional per month to AT&amp;T to tether using the built-in function of the OS.
I can see why this would be appealing to a lot of people not having to pay the carrier for a service they are literally already providing.
While the US Carriers have begun to accept tethering they are still all charging extra for it and something like this gives people an option to do it for less essentially.

We stated it was to stop the rumors. We never report rumors. We are sorry you are disappointed in this but we made that quite clear on the story at the first publishing of it.

We already reached out to Amazon, Walmart and Target for all three to give us an official response. I'll put it this way, one of them said (off the record for now) if GAW keeps using the XYZ name as a "partner" they will be forced to take legal action.

Additional thoughts as I sit here reading and thinking about this, if he is uploading something with some illegally obtained emails I am still thinking he made a grave mistake.
I hope he just decided to upload and shut out the world to write and didn't get nuked or hacked or whatever.

We sent it via email. The support ticket was generated automatically.

I feel kind of bad for warning him if they were illegally obtained he might want to reconsider how he released them now because I also want to see them.
IF he is laying low and does see any of this I hope when he feels safe again he will come back with a safe system and just dump them.

A lot of site administrator's can't afford the 800 per month fee from CloudFlare to turn on SSL and still get DDOS protection that is critical in this space.
We've been evaluating turning it on Coin Fire even though we are "just a news site" because we believe the web will be a better place with SSL everywhere.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:11:55
We hope to share more information still in the near future. Between fighting DDOS attacks, now threats of lawsuits on top of the threats of lawsuits we are already defending ourselves from it has been a bit hairy recently.
The DMCA post is in the works, a post about the hacking is in the works as well. We try to make sure each piece is checked repeatedly for facts, even when they are meta posts. We have to be extra careful now with so many microscopes pointed at us as to what EXACTLY we say.
Balancing our standard editorial calendar along with the new events that are meta has proven a bit more difficult that we originally anticipated but everything is coming.
I hate to say "two more weeks" (TM) but we are working on it all :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:25:03
No one expected it would be. Was likely a grab for karma.
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:39:08
We certainly receive bitcoins tips and other cryptocurrency tips but we never hold on to anything. We don't have any interest in pumping anything or only reporting one side of things.
When we receive tips we immediately spend them on expenses such as servers (we pay with bitcoin), DDOS protection, gift cards for staff to eat pizza (via Gyft) and what not.
We are familiar with the technology, we just don't hold it or try to pump it as others have been said to do.
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:30:26
It would be nice to generate vanity addresses on a mobile app. Granted the mobile app wouldn't have the necessary power to perform this task but I am thinking you could setup a system where the program runs on your server to do the searches and then spits out in JSON the results back to your mobile application?
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:42:37
We haven't been allowed to see the DMCA notice yet. The only thing is shady to us right now, we were under the impression we would be allowed to respond to any notice received but we haven't even been allowed to see it yet.
We are moving as quickly as possible to rescue our data and move to another provider.

Next time, we will just post them anyways.

I totally buy things with it. I have actually never once converted to USD directly. I'll buy cards of Gyft, or use merchants that actually sell directly in BTC.
I like BTC as an actual currency so I want to use it as such and am hoping more places take up adoption so I can just keep using it.

I think I did have the advantage in this situation as my mom knows that I travel a lot for bitcoin stories (I rarely ever make it around to see my parents anymore) so she knows I have some involvement.
I've talked to her about it in the past but she usually just goes back to the things that interest her... now bitcoin has her interest.
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:30:18
My BK also refused the Gyft card I purchased. They are the only place that consistently refuses it, been to six different stores.

We will have to wait until Monday for the FTC response as they don't work on the weekends.
The USMS promised if they found anything new out to call on Monday morning as well no later than 11am Central.
In the meantime we've got some boots that will be on the ground soon. Just purchased a flight ticket so that we can check the validity of the claims of an ex-parte order at the FTC offices.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:53:00
I'll message you. We sent someone to the FTC offices. It got complicated and crazy.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:45:48
The USMS has outright and flat out denied that this is true as our original story states.
We have reached out to the FTC along with the FBI though just to make sure all bases are covered but as of right now we have received ZERO confirmation that this is true.

I hope you countered with the fact that cash can also be used for dugs and terrorist activities and asked them to cite a source where bitcoin was used for a terrorist activity.
Also counter with the countless times PayPal has just shut off accounts.

Most of them aren't blatantly flaunting the fact they got away with it on Twitter though either by posting like nothing is going on.

True but others in the class might see that conversation. Use it as an opportunity to educate the others?
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:52:11
Yeah the FTC provided a very cryptic statement and we have a reporter on the ground in DC pursuing documents.
Statement on the site but copying here as well:
At this time we are unable to respond to this story or any court ordered actions that may have been issued in regards to this company for the date given. If and when this changes an official statement will be provided to your organization.
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:15:54
So we've kept quiet on Coin Fire because we don't respond to rumors or speculation and we are going to keep it that way but we do have a staff member reviewing just this little bit of material you have released thus far.
As of right now, I don't see anything here all of that damning. Brendon one of our team members says that these dates correspond to dates of activity from the Willy Report though and raises the question if the Willy Report and the bot are connected to this all somehow. At first glance those dates add up nearly perfectly but again, we need more information.
I'm also curious, can you confirm if that is the case and can you please accelerate your document release?
People are going to have a hard time believing you because of things like Gox.
We certainly aren't going to run anything about this until enough evidence is released that we can independently verify. So, get to it if that is your goal.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:41:52
That makes sense but is Lighthouse really the answer?

I read a story yesterday about a guy using BTC at Reeds in person and how everyone that worked in the store was watching it by the end of transaction and just amazed about how that is the future.
I think showing people in person how to actually use it for a physical good will do a lot of good for the whole thing personally.

Has TigerDirect's Bitcoin sales primarily been around the mining industry? Have you seen a lot of sales for GPUs etc?
@_date: 2014-07-13 19:47:49
How is this getting votes? This is the biggest load of rubbish I think I have seen today.
One, it is Facebook not FaceBook. Two, they aren't going to do this. Launch a digital payments platform, yes, launch it on a blockchain, no. We can debate that all day but this article is extremely misleading.
Facebook has not made a public statement regarding the implementation of a digital currency as this article implies.
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:57:27
I saw your message on here in my inbox. I suggest you go back, use TOR and register here and Bitcoin Talk. From what I have heard reddit will respond to a subpoena if they get one.
If you are going to go through and share you might want to not use this account anymore if it is linked to your actual IP address if you are truly as scared of the legal counsel coming after you as you've stated here.
I'd message as well once you come back via more secure means.
Didn't want to reply via messages in case you already logged out and came back on new username or something.

Perhaps this is an alt account for Professor Bitcorn?!?
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:09:30
Again with the unfounded accusations? Please see my other reply. We just don't care what the other sites are doing. It isn't our site, we shouldn't dictate how it is ran.

We would be happy to help in someway. Just send me over a message :)

Correct, they haven't put pen to paper yet on the deal. At least they haven't publicly yet.

I might be incompetent but not government level incompetent ;)
In all seriousness though I decided to take a crack at my passion of trying to find stories, I'm not a great writer by any means but I have always loved chasing stories and for the last several months I've done just that.
I'm not going to let it bankrupt me though and will be cutting down on travel here soon. The biggest reason for it was to establish that I am serious about it.
This is purely an expensive hobby. Some people buy yachts, some buy planes and I have friends that have done those things and I have never understood it. I say to them pursue whatever passion it is that you have and do it to the maximum. This was mine.
If only it were glamorous as getting paid secretly. Most days it is ramen and cutting corners where I can, crashing at friends places on a couch versus hotels, lots of trashy but cheap fast food and not knowing where I'll be next but figuring it out as I go.
I am like every other millennial. I have no fucking clue what I am doing or what I want to do, but I'm going to take the time to figure it out ;)
BTW, This is a denial ;)

Would love to talk with you about this. Mike
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:43:37
Just send them to all of the news sites at once using TOR or something similar perhaps? Be prepared to prove they are real though.
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:03:42
Interesting. They outright lied to us, then told us to embargo the story until a certain time this morning, then let someone else break the embargo.
Lessons learned: Don't respect the government imposed embargo. Fuck it, publish anyways. Sort it out in court.
@_date: 2014-07-04 02:23:14
The way they handle fraud reports, the fees they charge in comparison to other services, they have been slow to adapt.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:34:32
Not working for me either. In USA. Booking a room I often book and getting no coinbase page either.
Turned off VPN. Still not working.
Watching price literally go up as it isn't working and starting to look at alternatives after having used Expedia loyally since they rolled out bitcoin.

I'm guessing bots as well. Any company could get a ton of bots and then down vote articles that don't shed them in the best of light and up vote those that do. The better bots are voting on other things over time to seem more legit while waiting for the stuff they are told to vote on depending on the bias.

Yes, FUD
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:09:47
Is that the case if I am reading via RSS?
No one should ever write a "sponsored story" just run advertisements.
If you want to make a post saying hey this week we want to thank our sponsors ala Mashable style I would think that is okay but basically just outright selling stories?
Edit: I obviously write at Coin Fire. I have no beef with CCN. I like the site it is well designed and perhaps someone should reach out to the author on Twitter?
@_date: 2014-09-20 08:41:50
If ZapChain allowed Twitter instead of just Facebook I could chime in to say that we contacted USMS and they flat out denied this to be true.
The FTC has yet to return our calls.
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:49:13
It seems like if it is somehow announced already it shouldn't be reposted from what they are saying. It makes sense not wanting to see the same headline over and over even if some contain stories and others don't.
@_date: 2014-06-24 06:45:02
Certainly is very interesting. I am certainly curious to see how it plays out in the end.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:58:44
Given the way WU has acted in the past with fees, etc this might be a good thing ;)

They actually do take bitcoin....
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:00:28
I've really tried to stay out of this drama as much as possible. We try to only focus on what we are doing on our site and not what others may or may not be doing.
That said, we aren't affiliated with Tom in any way shape or form.
We did email him recently asking to use his bot net feature on our site but he declined and we decided it was best to just keep writing original content anyways.
I have no personal beef with any of the sites that are on this list. We just publish what we publish and if others are doing payola type stuff than so be it.
That said, making an accusation such as that is a pretty strong thing to do when we've never taken a stance regarding other sites and what they do.
I did a little digging as to what could have made this accusation come forward and I see now it is because of GovAccount. A user who was working on a startup that kept government officials transparent.
They had emailed us recently asking for coverage and we told them to come back when they had more than a landing page.
The guy behind it didn't take offense to that but he then saw our USMS coverage and became an evangelist of sorts I guess. We definitely don't ask people to be shills for us.
We would rather spend our time gathering and reporting news.
I can guarantee you that we aren't affiliated with them either.
Even though we are named as a "trusted source" even our editorial team is basically sitting at the moment and having a discussion regarding reddit, promotions and payola internally and we have all agreed the best way to move forward is to just keep doing what we are doing.
If you feel your editorial policy is one that is fair then keep doing it. We certainly are.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:14:28
We intend on keeping our reporting accurate, fact checked and up to date.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:58:27

Mmmmmm donuts.
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:59:47
I actually made this relatively clear above. We talked with him once about coverage for his site, we declined and he felt it was fair. We can't control everyone else on the Internet.
I am really shocked by the fact you've decided to turn the attack to a site that is clearly saying we have nothing against your site.
You are misconstruing the simple facts, we had nothing to gain from this as we didn't even know it was a so-called sting. This has always been our policy.
He sent us an email stating he loved what we were doing and was going to spread it to others. We aren't going to tell people to NOT share things they enjoy.
You are simply angry your site was in the sting and taking it out on others now for no reason whatsoever.
I would rather not have to deal with the hundreds of accusatory emails we received today.
Also I'm not going to just standby while you slander me publicly making wild accusations. I have nothing against your site or any other site, we just do what we do and that is our plan.
@_date: 2014-08-07 23:54:08

Honestly I don't see her much to give her updates on what is going on.
Perhaps I am not the greatest son in that regards in all honesty.
I am going to ask her today how she feels about the price fluctuations and WHY she is interested now. I don't believe her motivation is price but the documentary does focus on price a lot so it will be interesting to hear what  her motivation is.
She wasn't really aware of why I travel so I'll have that conversation with her and see what her honest opinion is and report back here.

We are waiting on a few more pieces of the puzzle. Some interesting developments, we have also asked GAW to comment on this piece but they likely will handle this as they handled the last piece where we "asked hard questions" and simply ignore our request for comment.
That said, we will wait a bit longer to give them a chance to respond to our request for a comment.

We wouldn't use CloudFlare for SSL, we use it for DDOS protection. Which we need. We've faced 40gig plus attacks on our site on a regular basis and CloudFlare is literally the only thing we can do to protect ourselves at this point.
Going to check out the free SSL stuff and see what I can find out. We already have a certificate purchased etc we just didn't implement it because we've been grappling with the idea of paying such a high cost each month to keep the DDOS protection.

Completely. The bidders have no idea what others bid even.

No problem. Facebook imposed that cap but I think someday they will let up on it.

@_date: 2014-07-04 16:05:29
That isn't what I've found. PayPal charges a fee for "advanced" services per month. Braintree, Navigate and others do not charge you this same fee.
Braintree charges a full five dollars less per chargeback, my online merchant terminal in my traditional business also charges $15 compared to the $20 that PayPal charges.
Until you reach 10k in sales nearly all services, Stripe, PayPal, BrainTree, Navigate, Authorize.net and others charge the same 2.9%+.3 fee.
I do concede that PayPal does become cheaper once you've reached the 10k per month mark. Depending on what you are doing once you reach the 100k per month mark PayPal is also cheaper in pure percentages with the rate becoming 1.9+.3 but only on transactions past the 100k per month mark. The charges before that were still charged the 2.9%+.3 fee.
Also most services charge a different rate for American Express. BrainTree incurs no additional charge, while Authorize.net and most traditional terminals with online services you are looking at a full percentage point more. I concede here that PayPal is cheaper or on par with others.
It is interesting because BrainTree is owned by PayPal now yet most of the fees are still cheaper, a BrainTree account is harder to secure than a PayPal account though as the underwriting process up front is more in-depth.
PayPal is cheaper for SOME people depending on what you are doing. For the masses other services are cheaper (once you reach that 10k mark, PayPal is cheaper).
So it is dependent on what level of transactions you are doing. If others here are saying PayPal is cheaper by far they must be the type of people doing more than 10k or 100k per month because until that point Stripe, PayPal and BrainTree are nearly on par with each other or slightly cheaper (minus monthly fees, or just outright lower costs until that mark).

This is a pretty well done scam.
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:52:58
Thanks! We typically think like this when it comes to something sent to us.
1. Receive email.
2. Verify it actually came from a user at company via LinkedIn and headers.
3. Follow-up the email with a phone call to the person giving us information.
4. Ask if we can send someone to meet them in person.
5. If they decline we typically become suspicious.
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:19:11
Sure: 
More to come in the future as attorneys comb through everything since threats have been made against us publicly. Here: 
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:22:21
Doubtful but they have all of my contact information from when I made initial contact and I flew to DC to visit to get the documents so it would have been hard for me to deny later ;)
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:52:25
The statement they received doesn't read like they put things on hold. It reads like a statement from someone completely inundated by the media trying to get details while coordinating notifications.
Also do you trust a site that is advertising another story with this image on it?
Perhaps you do ;)
In all reality though I haven't heard anything sensational like this yet from another other sources besides them.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:19:00
You are correct, even the bidders don't know if they won yet.
The USMS themselves said Monday, a later Reuters report after the auction cleared this up even further after being reported earlier in the day.
@_date: 2014-10-29 03:22:47
We will see how it shakes out. The letters say they can't talk about them. We've passed on the unredacted documents to some mainstream news services and sources now along with exact contact information on where we got the information and I think we will see how it shakes out in a few weeks.
Much like our initial reports on BFL that people outright said were a lie even after Mike posted a twitter picture of the actual ex-parte order the week before it will just be a matter of time before the _full_ story comes out.
We redacted the documents, not the people providing them and we got them in person with no middle men involved so we stick by the reports.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:30:30
Saw that, decided against that. Maybe the person behind it will actually PM us directly.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:21:18
No, I don't agree with posting anything, anywhere for cash but they do at least mark them as sponsored.
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:43:54
When someone whens an item on the standard USMS auction site you can see who won, I would think this would apply here as well if they are going to evenly apply the rules.
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:28:23
Awesome, thumbs up from me in that case!
@_date: 2014-10-29 03:19:09
We do, just didn't have one of all the latest comments etc. They are taken offsite by a member of our team but only once per day. This is now changing moving forward. We will be doing hourly backups offsite.

To my knowledge this ticket wasn't closed on our end.
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:08:53
Dude, if these emails weren't obtained via legal means you should really reconsider that.
You clearly believe you are on to something and I'm not going to say you aren't but we haven't seen anything here yet that shows that for a fact.
If you are requiring on emails that were obtained illegally to show how it all comes together you've likely made a grave mistake that is going to result in you behind bars. Even if they were doing something criminal. Two wrongs won't make it right in the eyes of the law.
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:12:28

I wouldn't suggest pastebin personally. They've been shown in the past to cooperate with law enforcement officials.

I have surfed a lot of sites and you bring up a valid point but anytime I find a site I do NOT like I will be posting a review and NOT including links. Originally my goal was to only post sites that I like but I figured that people are going to say the same thing you are. It makes sense but I want to review the good, the bad and the ugly and give honest opinions of them all.

Thanks for the credit on the article from our site ;)
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:07:08
It appears that people aren't clicking in and just assuming it doesn't contain several new quotes that aren't appearing on the other news sites. They just assume it is another copy paste article.
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:57:24
That is our single biggest expense. We don't take payments for articles and we don't have any "investors".
A story like 1-800-Flowers will cost between 1,000 - 2,000 in travel.
I (Mike) pay a lot of this out of pocket with earnings from mining or trading that I'll do on the side.
Scoops like this usually end up costing about 3 or 4k total when you factor in travel, time, food, etc.
We typically will have a scoop like this only once a month or so. I oftentimes will rely on friends around the country to crash on a couch to save money on hotels and what not if needed.
We've got a long story we've been working on involving a rather prominent member of the community right now that has cost upwards of 10,000 dollars to secure but when we finally get to the end of the tale will easily have been worth it.
Hosting is cheap thankfully, CloudFlare premium isn't but we still pursue these things because I want to do something different.
I do this because I am passionate about it, not because I will get rich because I am very realistic about the fact that I won't.
I do know though that by providing this sort of service it helps keep bitcoin on the minds of others and that does directly benefit me as I live nearly my entire life in cryptocurrency at this point. So, while I love it, I do have to admit that I do have a vested interest in seeing the currency grow as a currency.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:32:11
This doesn't even remotely match what we were given but that doesn't mean it is fake... it just means it doesn't match what we have.

Always suspicious but always following all potential leads. Even if they are just trolling... it could be a story. Still awaiting some sort of proof from this person.
Until they cough up more I would be suspect.

For those that doubt our connections. Our executive editor posted this on Twitter days before it was unsealed to the public regarding BFL: 
It doesn't take much to call the PR departments at each of those companies though, show them your credentials and get them to make a statement, just so many places don't.
We've been looking at those statements said they were originally said at Hashers United Conference.

1099s were provided. They all list the companies that are in existence one month and the next month they are "defunct". The real meaty thing that would seal the deal is who those companies get paid from.

They all had the same managing members whom we have exhausted a lot of options to contact. The person clearly doesn't exist or has taken a lot of work to hide themselves.

Until our source leaves we don't want to reveal the usernames but we did present the full evidence to the staff of reddit including usernames, screenshots, company formation documents, 1099s, access URLs, bank statements, etc and they never replied.
We've been advised that in situations such as this reddit will typically take the evidence and take appropriate action but won't comment.
If this is a trolling the person behind it would have spent considerable money to do it. The company formations in most states cost at least 75 - 100 dollars and he would have had to fill out at least 18 of them because we checked in on each of them.
A few of our guys are hoping we can learn more in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:48:02
Thanks, we really appreciate that.

But damages our reputation to keep sources secure... very, very, very damaging.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:13:07
We don't connect via the domain name in any way. Only to the acclaim address and all sensitive materials are sent over more secure means.
We never use email due to the possibility of it being intercepted for anything secure such as a document.
We don't use coinfire.cf in any way shape or form for email when it comes to connecting. For example my mail server settings themselves were acclaim.websitewelcome..... so those requests never visit that domain.
So we never received a warning via SSL because we didn't connect that way.
We don't like email for a reason when it comes to sensitive stuff because we are based in the States ;)
Edit: I always get sensitive documents in person when possible. That is the only way for me to verify they are legitimate typically as well.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:30:45
This wasn't an actual hacking of our site. This was social engineering against our domain registrar is the current belief.

And have our source go to jail?
Sometimes you just have to be patient and wait for an investigation to become public because the papers become public.
We published the FTC stuff about BFL while they were being raided and our source paid with his job. We don't want a repeat of that again. 
We won't sacrafice our source because of some doubt. The cards will all be played eventually and we will see what happens collectively.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:24:59
Wanted to confirm for everyone this was NOT a case of an expired domain name.
The domain was not set to expire until 05/15.
This is from the day we registered with Freenom. I have redacted the username, password and confirmation number.
If someone is a good domain history sleuth and can help us provide further proof that the domain ORIGINALLY wasn't set to expire until 05/15 that would be greatly appreciated as a lot of naysayers are claiming it was our negligence that caused the domain to become expired.
It wasn't even close to being expired.

We don't want our source to get fired or worse go to jail for the leaking of information. So we don't share names, we know that our reporting is true in this case having visited several of these SEC sources over the past few weeks and we believe this measured approach of document release will help protect our source.
Our attorneys also believe the way we are handling it will protect us.

They have purchased with us in the past and a quick text message last night asking the guy if he wanted to renew resulted in him purchasing an advertisement the moment I told him the new system was in place.
It was sitting as pending since late yesterday. I've been busy sorting through thousands of pages of SEC documents and until someone text me about this issue I hadn't had a chance to look at what was going on.
@_date: 2015-01-01 02:45:11

I was pretty certain it was bullshit but it was pretty bold of a GAW employee to say those words and utter the words partnership after the last ordeal.
We didn't run it as news for a reason. My personal account is different from our news site.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:12:39
We did produce the letter. We uploaded it redacted to Scribd. The entire letter.
We redacted the name of the SEC agent who sent it along with some other information regarding the people who received it.
This is undeniable: 
You are a troll though. You have spent considerable effort to troll me, and our contributors on here. This is literally the last effort I will spend on you. I don't have to defend reporting the truth.
You have set out to discredit myself and several other authors in this space who have proven themselves countless times over. The reddit community doesn't just trust someone with undeniable proof like delivering documents.
If GAW has the resources they claim they do and the facts back them up it wouldn't be hard to take us down. We are based in the US, we have published our address in the past, our attorneys have given them all of our relevant contact information, our attorneys have provided information regarding hosting companies, etc.
We can easily prove our claims in court if needed. We have signed and sworn affidavits from previous sources, we have documents, we have certifications and we have attorneys who have vetted this information and even shared it with GAW.
Notice that after the last big deal GAW backed off and got quiet? That's because we provided in a pre-discovery setting the goods to show we could easily defend ourselves. Perhaps you should be asking the beloved leader of Hashtalk why those litigation actions suddenly stopped?
If I can get the Twitter account restored (which of course was conveniently hacked as we publish the truth) you'll easily see I posted FULL pictures of the BFL sealed subpoena before we wrote an article about it. I was leaked those documents and sat on them before publishing an article but at least tweeted a picture of them.
People wouldn't be throwing that whole FTC thing in your face if they didn't distinctly remember that I did that.... which I clearly did.
I honestly have better things to do than defend myself against a troll who constantly trolls myself and other Coin Fire contributors... like actually getting documents, quotes and stories. So, perhaps it does seem I am not defending myself well... I would rather do what we've done in the past... let the truth come out and vindicate us later than fight with a no-one on the Internet.
Bring it on. We know we've already won.

Imagine the people who want to shut something down simply sending you a transaction with the "wrong" name in it.

We feel it is important everything be fact checked and that is why we published our own entry to help squelch the rumors.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:25:48
We hope we get it back as well.
We've got plenty of tickets open with our domain registrar regarding it.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:47:16
We were advised by our legal team to not send any more letters based on who we obtained the information from as it would potentially compromise our source.
That said, everyone cried it was FUD and it was later confirmed. The individual in the article did receive one of the letters we published.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:43:33
Thanks! We hope to keep delivering and keep cranking stories out.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:02:38
Is that site legit? I read a lot of reviews about how people get cards and they have no balances on them because the original seller kept the number. That seems risky.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:25:00
Thanks This is truly appreciated.
We are going to be back soon and bringing it exactly as we have been in the past.
As far as security goes we are unsure how this happened. We have secure passwords, we are very careful on where we enter those passwords and we don't use the same passwords from site to site.
Everything indicates this was an attack via our registrar and not via an insecure password or anything of that nature. Likely a social engineering attack against the registrar.
Hope to have more information in the near future as to what exactly happened.

No, totally understand.
We do pay for CoinFire with the tips we make from the site. We immediately put those tips towards our server which we pay for with BTC. If we don't make enough tips to cover the costs (which we never have made enough) we purchase BTC via Coinbase or Circle and pay our hosting that way. We don't hold cryptocurrency but the statements that we are using it to pay the bills is factually sound.
My mother does believe in bitcoin but she doesn't actively use it. She has performed a single transaction once using Coinbase but while she thinks it is an amazing technology she doesn't want to take the time to convert USD to pay for things in BTC when she can just use USD. She thinks it is cool, thinks it has a chance but thinks right now it is still a PITA to use. She can believe in it without thinking it is amazing or even using it.
Thanks for the questions! If you have further ones please don't hesitate to ask and keep up the good work on Coin Report.

It is relayed AdSense/Other Remanent via an API and we literally just flipped the switch to fill unsold inventory.
As it stands we don't currently have a paying advertiser so it just fills it in with generic inventory from third party networks.
We approve all advertisements that are sold directly. Which we just sold one and have activated it so it should replace the remanent inventory.

I can assure you, I've met Tom in a hotel room when he was practically running for his life because of his postings. The guy is legitimate. We don't always agree but when he says something people do take note.
I don't always agree with his methods either but he has played a major part in the past to exposing fraud.
I find him very brash but he gets things done and when he speaks it is only because he researched something and has some larger proof.
I am curious as to how this will play out in the end.

Thank you for providing this!
While it doesn't show the original expiration dates it does show almost back to the beginning of the domain.
It wasn't set to expire until May so this was a pretty clear hijacking. Considering our domain registrar account wasn't compromised (off domain, different info) it has been perplexing how they were able to pull this off so easily.
A lot of people are saying we let the domain expire since it was "reregistered" today.
This information goes a long way for us and I can't personally thank you enough.

Just as an FYI for everyone this was a generic advertisement that was served by a third party advertising network to fill remanent advertising space as we had no sold advertisements at the time.
We have reached out to make sure that in place of generic third party advertisements we are serving a simple 'Advertise Here' graphic that won't generate the revenue we desperately need to pay legal fees, server costs and stay online but it won't be for a ponzi scheme.

You do realize we had the actual letters. Like the real letters right?
Quit trying to discredit us. Our reporting has been 100% accurate in the past.
BFL court orders that were under seal before the were published, the SEC letters, countless other stories.
You are a troll with a large investment in GAW who is doing anything you can to desperately protect it and discredit us.
We know what we are doing, we report the truth and if it wasn't factual the previous articles would have been taken down by now.

Thanks for the comment!
We hope to have more to share in the near future.
I believe being honest, open, and transparent about what we know, don't know and what we are doing is the best thing we can do in this sad situation.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:50:40
We can absolutely back up what we have published.
I'm guessing the person who emailed the SEC will receive a "no-comment" as is the standard response for investigations underway.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:10:40
Thanks We are hopeful that something will come to light regarding this as well.
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:08:57
OS X users don't seem to be impacted the same way. Just tried on my MBP and it redirected to the installer for Silverlight. Strange.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:14:20
Unsure, we will certainly be keeping people up-to-date on this.
We were preparing to publish some previous pieces on what happened as our lawyers had finally given them a good look over.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:29:09
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:40:30
Sadly only Freenom offered .cf at the time.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:53:32
Yeah, I remember when they had a promo if you used a Walmart gift card at a gas station you got a discount.
I would just go buy the gift card and then pump the gas. It was such a good deal in that circumstance. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:07:44
This fucking day man.
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:02:38
What would you like to see? Police report numbers? Incident numbers?
I get the feeling based on your other posts on this thread you are simply seeking to troll and discredit us but if this is a legitimate request we can work something out where we give you the relevant information so you can contact them yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-21 07:06:35
Let us know if you are still experiencing the same issue. CloudFlare support assures us they are working on this issue and says it is related to our using our own SSL certificate with the service and sometimes things get lost in translation.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:21:39
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:29:00
Thanks We certainly believe we will regain control soon as well.
Also if you want a refund on your advertisement email hello and they will process it. We approved your advertisement before things went down and understand if the delay until it runs is an issue.
Otherwise once we are back online they will resume the advertisements in the order in which they originally were.
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:36:32
I laughed. Which is sad.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:55:46
Lionel Hutz helped me win my lawsuit against The Frying Dutchman. They wouldn't let me eat all the food I wanted after advertising "ALL YOU CAN EAT".
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:11:16
Thanks we will be in touch soon!
This is greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:56:20
This was an employee via phone.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:55:18
Many times over for gifts!
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:27:01
Really hoping we get it back online as well.
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:06:45
Same issue on my end. No responses here either. Same lag, 40+ confirms, no post back, no forwarding.
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:19:42
Good to know!
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:40:48
@_date: 2015-01-21 07:06:51
We've opened a ticket with CloudFlare. Thanks for the information!
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:02:17
Thanks We've been using Bitmessage, and several other systems to protect our sources. We have no doubt that our source is safe in this situation but we understand that even the implication they aren't will make others think twice and that is unfortunate.
Really appreciate your support.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:41:35
Yeah, someone sent us a message that they would keep attacking our DNS servers until we stop publishing stuff about GAW. We are working to resolve this issue with CloudFlare staff currently.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:09:55
Can you email leo as one of our contributors is writing about Gyft experiences for our site.
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:17:17
This does not inspire confidence in me for using them as a service.
I have a support ticket open.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:00:23
Keep writing! We need more people who seek the truth.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:08:12
Give us the IP address and we can work on getting your aggregator whitelisted.
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:26:08
Just did for me. They say that if you are in the United States or Canada it can be flakey though.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:25:04
No, our domain wasn't even set to expire until 05/05/15

@_date: 2015-01-22 22:40:51
Interesting, my local Walmart has told me they can't transfer gift card balances from one card to another.
Perhaps, just my local walmart employee being lazy though.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:09:52
That'd be pretty cool. Perhaps something to look at in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:27:42
We've always allowed all comments on our site, even the direct attacks against us.
We don't always agree with what others might say but we will allow them to say it.

@_date: 2015-01-16 17:58:12
Thanks! Haven't had a chance to look at my email very closely today :(

And was the title sponsor of the largest bitcoin conference this past weekend.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:17:54
Thanks you support is greatly appreciated and valued.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:03:54
We have no reason to believe GAW has received a subpoena as of yet based on the portion of the documents we have reviewed.
This is a different site being referenced. One that he does *not* operate.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:26:01
I think he would be paying us to shut up if anything ;)
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:25:06
We will work with CloudFlare to determine why this might be the case.
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:05:28
Thanks! We appreciate it. We believe we can get back online soon!
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:57:42
Text me if you'd like. Find me on Telegram. Wherever. I am very much real.
We only don't name a source when they specifically ask to not be named. Go back, read our stuff, we have a track record of breaking stuff and getting some big leads.
I am extremely transparent about who I am and what we do.
p.s We paid for our .CF domain.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:19:06
Can we chat? You know I've received tons of legal threats.
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:43:35
Thanks Andrew!
I hope the AMA went well!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:43:47
That seems like it might be one of the best options!
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:58:32
Are you willing to talk with Coin Fire about this?
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:26:21
Beware. Fake link, Fake Silverlight. Will steal your bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:22:04
Nope, not sure what is going on with my Twitter. Keeps telling me my account can't be found basically when trying to login. I keep trying my username and password with no luck thus far.
Going to open a ticket with Twitter and see what is going on but I know that will take time.
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:26:26
Thanks! We've still got a few more things to change over but we at least have the basics online and hope to have more reports coming down the pipe soon.
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:33:58
That's very cool. I might try and contact them and interview them!
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:11:42
We know that what happened here certainly wasn't within ICANN policies and have reached out to the registrar.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:49:13
Yeah, we are working on fixing this. Thanks for the heads up!
We've got a lot of things that still need changed over.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:49:52
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:48:34
We pay for CloudFlare service so it automatically spins up more protection when our site is attacked. That is what happened in this case.
We have no desire to stop bots or archiving our site as we always stand by our reporting.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:05:35
Hope we can get Doctors without Borders to take BTC!
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:01:37
We have no idea how they were even able to pull this off. We've been told that a transfer might reset the date though if it was a transfer between two accounts on the same registrar. We are unaware of how that works in that it is a complete mystery as to how they even pulled this off at the moment.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:57:23
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:42:04
We are having serious issues as an attacker is slamming our machines directly now. We are working to mitigate.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:21:47
What browser are you using? I can pass along the info to our CloudFlare rep which is likely where this issue is coming from.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:35:47
Serious business.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:03:42
We've been under constant attack the past 12 hours. I get to be a bit defensive when people make constant threats and tell us to shut up and stop reporting things.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:03:18
Thanks for chiming in with your opinion. We aren't after attention here, we'd rather the situation not have happened at all.
This does nothing but harm's our site's ability in the future to get any sort of confidential information.
Considering our site is nearly 100% about bitcoin many believe it is relevant but I can certainly understand your belief that it isn't.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:29:55
We have passed this information on to law enforcement.
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:23:46
My personal Twitter was hacked so the link is disabled for the pictures of BFL stuff at the moment but it certainly exists and perhaps someone has an archive or I'll get my personal Twitter account back soon.
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:06:01
And now instead of reading documents I am playing Simpsons Tapped Out... damn it.
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:53:07
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:18:53
It takes time, we have something already in draft. If you'd like proof of that please let me know and I'll direct message you a draft link.
We have been on the phone for two days with every state. It took us over two weeks to compile info for the Paybase story.
This doesn't just happen overnight.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:59:57
Many thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-02 01:18:30
Thanks and great to see people not just capitulating to the demands.
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:12:49
What major retailer will announce bitcoin acceptance next?
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:52:59
Do you want us to stop reporting the facts Bruce?
We just report them as we get them.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:50:11
One of the people we spoke with is now claiming they were under the impression it was off the record. We are always very careful about this though and have the emails (and headers etc) in tact to show that we were VERY clear it was on the record.
We will see how this shakes out in the end and in the meantime, just keep reporting.
We are just a very small team and resources are becoming extremely limited as time rolls on so it gets tougher to defend from multiple angles and keep reporting at the same time.
We are working as hard as we can to do it all and have brought in a team of six people from outside the community to help us begin reviewing some documents regarding another story. We've got a lot on our collective plate at the moment.
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:30:12
Plus members can attest that this was on our calendar before the prime controller situation.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:41:25
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:38:04
I am also unsure for sure if that is what he meant. Perhaps he can chime in? @_date: 2014-09-22 22:09:56
Yeah, something MAY have happened but we are being extra careful and awaiting all of the appropriate block confirmations ;)
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:29:54
Coinbase isn't escaping though from investigations though. We are working on tracking down stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:14:25
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:57:29
This is something we've been actively researching recently. Hoping to roll something out in the future.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:38:38
FudFire? Mature.
In all seriousness though can you 100% say the investigation isn't happening. I can assure you that it is. 100% still ongoing. Investigations take time and eventually the truth will come out and vindicate the site once again.
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:48:02
Not looking to say "told you so" in this situation.
Honestly, I wish it wasn't the case that things had gone so badly. A lot of people will lose a lot of money this way :(
That said, the news is still the news and the facts are still the facts and we will keep reporting them.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:20:50
If you can do a better job please don't hesitate to reach out. We are always open for potential submissions.
@_date: 2015-09-19 15:24:40
I don't hear any more chirping in our coal mine.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:47:19
We only go hard in the paint when we have the info to do so ;)
In all honesty though if betarigs is changing hands that is newsworthy.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:34:32
People called bullshit when it was about GAW as well.... or BFL... or many others. In each instance the agency has publicly confirmed what was reported sometimes months prior.
We will just wait.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:26:33
Sorry, this was happening before that post was made so this is just a conspiracy and likely not true ;)
Our status site  showed this relatively small attack taking place before that post from Mr. Garza was made.
Plus, it was very easy to mitigate and from a single IP range.
We don't know who is behind it but that likely wasn't the case.
@_date: 2015-03-29 17:15:31
Bandwidth caps on this end sadly.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:59:59
Who is your ISP? We have had similar reports for our friends in Canada having issues and have been working with Cloudflare to resolve them.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:53:04
Please direct all questions, comments and concerns to our attorneys. legal
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:46:05
Not at all. We published the SEC subpoena and people said it was total bullshit. Many months later the SEC confirmed it.
Just that people often say our documents aren't real and then later, the exact documents oftentimes show up ;)
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:08:49
We have tried to get these guys to find us on a more secure platform but this is the one they want to use. We can educate them to use other more secure platforms all we want but if they keep refusing and only want to use a less secure one we will go where they are to get the story.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:16:22
Where did we claim to be the highest quality news around?
Also, just because someone at the company is stating that doesn't mean the entire report should be dismissed.
Before we publish something we take care to verify the information and I've seen an early and scrapped implementation of BTC for PokerStars. The contributor who wrote the piece took a large number of steps to verify the story as well.
Your constant trolling is noted though.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:08:59
Have your friend contact mike
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:01:47
This is the third report this week of someone purchasing specifically an eBay card and not having it working.
I am fairly confident that they will get this corrected for you but am shaken to see so many reports about eBay specifically this week.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:11:09
Did you purchase betarigs?
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:10:32
We paid and are working on a post still that contains receipts, invoices and our communications with Freenom since the incident.
Let's put it nicely and say they have been very very unhelpful because they know they messed the entire situation up and not don't want to own the fact they did.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:31:39
We published guidelines on how we vet items.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:35:11
Your attorneys can gladly contact ours at legal
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:07:59
And you are a troll.
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:04:30
Let's hope they learn that soon enough.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:11:42
We will be doing documents on GitHub at  along with several other tech sites.
These documents will be on GitHub so that others can make improvements and licensed appropriately to make them open sourced.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:24:12
Sa'll good. Not sure why reddit didn't give me the standard already submitted warning. Meh.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:11:44
Weird, I've personally seen the first failed implementation and the [REMOVED] team is spinning a wildly different story.
Edit: Removed specific department to further protect sources.
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:01:42
Yeah, ISPS limit the total bandwidth you can use in a month and sadly it is already super low with normal use you almost always go over.
No choice on switching either. Many areas have a single provider even to this day.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:23:24
If we hadn't linked to the article regarding the "rumors" we would have been chastised for not linking to others talking about it and not proving that was stated before.
We have never once stated other sources are corrupt, we have never once even suggested that other sites are "corrupt". We just report the facts.
I can assure you that we don't run rumors. If we are stating it to be true we have personally sat down and likely met with someone and been shown something.
The integration is being finished. For the second time.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:17:39
Sent an SMS to a few of our sources. The response we got back from one was literally,


@_date: 2015-02-02 21:10:55
Each contributor is compensated fairly.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:08:14
Please email me mike as I don't want to compromise our sources.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:16:36
Got your email. Assigned to one of our contributors.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:33:17
Investigation continues.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:31:18
I'm going to go with our trusted sources on this one. We received the same sort of negative feedback in the past with other stories where low-level employees denied what we reported and later the CEO came out and confirmed what we reported.
No error has been made. We reported that multiple *company* sources gave us this information.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:31:26
You do realize that GAW still has NOT filed in a single state as of yet... Coinbase did and was APPROVED.
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:41:14
You can find some really good information about the various wallets and the differences here: 
Some security details can be found here:

If you can bring undeniable evidence to the table please message us.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:42:39
Yet, you keep trolling our posts specifically.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:14:41
They have shown us the previous implementation that failed.
If you feel our news quality isn't up to par for news or quality please submit what you would do differently and we will consider your thoughts.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:18:20
Please show me where just registering as an MSB suddenly makes you legal to operate in all fifty states.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:10:45
The domain wasn't set to expire until May. This statement is just false.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:07:27
False. Three states outright told us if they have applied but have not received the appropriate license from the state they can not under any circumstances operate with customers in the state. No exceptions.
We have consulted several attorneys regarding this and several regulatory officials and the answer was always clear, no permits means illegal operations in several states.
This isn't the case universally but in some states it is.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:18:59
You do realize this news came from people *inside* the company. Yeah?
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:07:51
We did follow them as more than one person from the Coin Fire staff met personally in person with Poker Stars people.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:43:32
This is not only a fake story clicking on it will be harmful to your wallet! The domain is zeroShedge instead of zero hedge. This isn't the real site and if you click on the link a javaapplet will run that is designed to steal your bitcoins.
DO NOT TRUST UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.
