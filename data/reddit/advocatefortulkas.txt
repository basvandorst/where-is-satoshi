... Are you high? 9% annual ROI is a good return. It's not mind blowing by any means but it's good.

This subreddit? No. Lol

You should not ever give any friend financial advice without layers and layers and layers of caution and hesitation. 
Also if they lose everything be prepared to be blamed. Was it their decision? Yes. Were you involved whether you think it's your fault or not? Yes. Can you change their mind if they think it's your fault? Well good luck. 
Also do not ever go "all in" on something unless you're about to die or want to admit you have a gambling problem.

Inflation isn’t inherently bad

I’m starting to think they don’t understand what a government is. 
All I’m really saying is that you’d rather have laws in support of bitcoin rather than laws hostile towards bitcoin and I’m being accused of not knowing what I’m talking about? People get really weird about bitcoin like its magic.

I didn’t say anything about shutting it down. They can make your life very very difficult. They can make it substantially less appealing for people to want to accept bitcoin, so on and so forth. 
They can’t stop it like flipping a switch but you damn well want them on your side.

That’s part of the issue. If your government for some weird reason decided they just didn’t like bitcoin as a concept, you’d be just about fucked. Maybe not completely but close to it. 
Fortunately we seem to be past that mostly.

Bitcoin enthusiast? In general I seem to be a bit of a money enthusiast. Love to examine and collect it. Hand it out to strangers for their things. Life long hobby really.

If I use something like Coinbase to purchase bitcoin is my purchase in terms of bitcoin locked in at the time I submit the transaction or the time it goes through

He's incredibly bias and invested in the success of bitcoin, so I'd take it with a huge chunk of salt without being down on bitcoin. His overall message obviously we all can agree with for the most part
