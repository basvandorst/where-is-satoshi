You could also argue your vote doesn’t matter but you still go to the poles and do your duty as a citizen!

As in we do you mean everyone except yourself? Why don’t you get off your ass and start programming then!

It sounds like you haven’t done your homework.

You aren't a visionary

I agree with you! I do think at least 3 cryptos will be big winners. But when you look at the bitcoin infrastructure behind it. I.e  satellites, money, and some of the smartest people in the world working on  it. I think it gives bitcoin the ability attract even more intelligent people and build its way out of any issues which arise. So for now it realistically looks like bitcoin will go the Long haul.

Could you add where each currency is being sold

You realize if quantum computers break cryptography then we have bigger issues than worrying about bitcoin.

Well I was thinking mainly for the smaller coins. You can get the top coins anywhere but it gets harder to find some of them the farther down the rankings you go.

A lot of people are thinking about this an a guy named Richard heart is working on a coin to solve CFD problems with the computing power. The issue with using the  computing power for something useful which in turn could be monetized, is you could hedge  a 51 percent attack. That’s why bitcoin is so secure with sha-256 ASICS is because the hardware can’t do anything else except run sha-256. So if you bought enough hardware to run a 51 percent attack you would not only lose money from electricity but you could not resell the miners.

Those are very basic questions. You
Should do some more research. Try reading some books.
