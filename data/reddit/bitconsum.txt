Currently, there are no credit protection mechanisms other than the state legal system. If the state officially bans Bitcoin, then lending in Bitcoin will be impossible.

It is very difficult for people to accept something that is not like what they saw before. Everyone enthusiastically accepted the Internet, because it looks like improved TV and mail. But there were no analogues of bitcoin before, so the most common was the idea of ​​bitcoin as a stock of some company, that is, as an investment. Everyone thinks: today I will buy bitcoin and in five years I will sell it ten times more expensive and become rich. But Bitcoin is a means of exchanging and transmitting value, not a stock. If it is not in circulation then its value does not grow. And it is completely unknown how to prove this to people ...

Unfortunately, most people perceived bitcoin as a stock asset. Therefore, almost the only source of filling Bitcoin with value was the expectation of future growth. But this expectation cannot last forever, it is inevitably replaced by disappointment, and financial capital skillfully takes advantage of this.

You are right, the future is unevenly distributed. It is in our power to promote its more uniform and dense distribution. Thanks for the inspiring posts.

This is some fake news. Bitcoin is used extremely rarely in online shopping, and mainly for the sale of illicit drugs.

Technical characteristics of the cryptocurrency, such as the number of coins, cannot be changed without a hard fork since there is a blockchain. As a result of the hard fork, a completely different coin is formed, with a completely different market value.

The state is immoral, even if it grants loans. Bank finance capital is immoral. With the transition to hard money, the entire governance structure must change. The world community is governed by a system of interconnected committees on a strictly elective basis, as described in A. Clarke’s novel “The End of Childhood”

Great said! I stopped using Сoinbase in the fall of 2017, and I had to use extreme ingenuity to get my bitcoins back. It was a really tough test of nerve strength!

In fact, since the debt is denominated in dollars, it is extremely beneficial for the United States to be a debtor. On the contrary, creditor states suffer losses.

If it were not for the corruption of governments and banks, then a healthy economy could be built on bitcoin. A negative interest rate is a great scenario for bitcoin. Suppose that the state accepted bitcoin as a single currency. In this case, the holders of a large number of bitcoins will be much more profitable to give their government a loan at a negative percentage and thus introduce bitcoins into the economy. So, if today the holder of 1000 bitcoins can buy a plant at them, then in 10 years he can buy 10 factories for 500 bitcoins. This is a direct consequence of the deflationary model of bitcoin: remember two bitcoin pizzas!

US government debt is about $ 22 trillion. What happens if the Fed turns on the printing press and the US government pays off its debt? Obviously the Apocalypse. That's the reason to love the dollar)))

I put together a small farm on graphics cards in 2017. I have relatively cheap electricity, but now the rig provides mainly heat. If you do not have a million dollars, then there is no particular economic sense in mining. It will be much more useful to create an online store or service that works on cryptocurrency. Our project was created to help all people start a cryptocurrency business.
