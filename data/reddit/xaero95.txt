Is there any official statement, where you can find that they speculate in Bitcoin, to burn the tokens? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:45:35
Would Tether still be worth exactly 1USD, if the whole company would operate 100% transparent? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:40:23
Can you please elaborate why? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:05:38
Can we make it to subscount/BTC 1:1? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:06:13
Excuse me if I bored you. I really don't think this thing is legal.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:43:15
Yes. For several minutes or so.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:41:31
what if other crypto currency will be catching up by the TOTAL HONEST 'media'?
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:47:22
Let's wait for China.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:55:46
Unfortunately not.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:14:39
LoL Venezuela, good luck with that!
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:45:23
Wait for China to wake up.

@_date: 2017-08-07 21:47:54
Not to be rude or anything. But how is it counting when there is only one single donation of 10k and nobody else donated? 
Bitcoin is a super volatile asset. 
Even That 10k will worth 25k in 5 months.
Just curious
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:06:07
I'm at it.But never seen things like this.
Contact support? Maybe they'll figure it out, it shoukdn't be a big thing. They'll help!
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:16:31
WAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU GO GO
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:12:52
This is a "MUST". If a currency is not tried out properly then nobody knows its capabilities. Over time this "Hype" will drop. Because to be honest in percentage there are not many people in China who has the power of "purchase".
Yes there are ALOT of miners.
BUT. Miners need money to pay out the bills. They are not hodlers, they're not able to do such a thing.
They sell. As much as possible. To us, who can hodl.

From the other sub: "litecoin is a bullshit pump and dump scam controlled by Core and minions and is tainted by segwit so doomed to fail. Same shit we just got away from. May want to use your head there. "
WTF? :D
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:19:53
Depends on the seller. But most of them are quick.

"802: Unauthenticated request
What it means: The exchange’s API returned an authentication error, perhaps because your API keys are invalid.
What you can do: Import a fresh API."
EDIT: This is the cryptowat.ch's problem, not kraken's.

Dude. That's the point. If you didn't understand what he said. no wonder why you used changelly.
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:00:26
Cash is printable. Gold is not printable. 
ICOs are printable. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is not printable. Cash is inflating. Bitcoin is deflating.

Please help:

Also. 
1. You'll need a calculator there which is always ONLY for bitcoin conversion like a tablet or something. 
2. You'll need a QR code for receiving a payment(better digital renewable than fixed paper) 
3. You'll need a terminal, like a phone or something which has a light wallet, which shows the payment received. 
They(your employees) should create always a new address each time they receive a payment, so then they will be able to confirm that the payment arrived from THIS client or THAT one, plus your clients won't be able to see your whole income so far. [IMPORTANT]
There should be a policy, for example no refunds or something because of the fluctuation of the prices, the clients will have to pay a locked in price. 
Once I saw a shady tactic, where they showed Fiat / BTC not the other way around. For example: 
This costs 10 USD (rate 0.0000156xxx) 
*The good way*: 10 USD or 25 mBit (6052 USD / BTC)

Did he make a backup file of the wallet before? If so, there's a tutorial for the full node wallet restore.
Edit: typos.

And by claiming is only the matter of shares. I hope I understand it right.
Thank you so much!

on Bitcoin-QT 
Click on the "Help" tab. 
Then the "Debug window". 
On the Information tab you can see it at

Bitcoin is now officially dead.

@_date: 2017-07-19 21:37:46
Thank you TigerBeetle for your help! 
I understand the concept of Bitcoin pretty much. 
Everything else was clear, but this one small thing about the fees and claiming them bugged me. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:21:04
Thank you! I will ask there.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:49:06
