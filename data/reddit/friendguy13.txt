Not really, they also have quite a few weapons and soldiers.

The violence has already been started (government enforced ISP monopolies) this is just more violence to mitigate the unforeseen negative consequences of the initial violence.

Yes but those are not necessarily the same as the US rules.

Lawsuits are not regulation and do not require a government controlled legal system.

Taxes are theft.

Can we get a version without the selection markers?

I felt that way before, but then I watched this and it changed my mind.

"coin dusting"?

Not true US is one of the only countries that taxes it's citizens regardless of location.  What you suggested is almost definitely legal in Canada.

It isn't exploitive, payday loans are often the best option available for the poor.

The problem is that their fees are way too high.

Yes.  But he's new to the Bitcoin party.

Except a quantum resistant cryptocurrency.

And that matters because...


Socialist ethics are social constructs because they are false and have no basis in logic.  Libertarian ethics descend from self ownership and are universal and inherently true.  Saying property rights are a social construct is the same saying that gravity or general relativity are social constructs.

I have heard this before but I don't get why it is not considered random.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:14:10
And why is that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:32:38
It was a joke. Though I did miss out I wanted to buy since it at $50 but was to lazy to actually do it.  *facepalm*

Fed means Federal Reserve Bank AKA the part of the government that decides how many dollars to print and who to give those dollars to.  If Bitcoin becomes popular the Fed would be destroyed.

Only some Austrians are anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-07 01:20:50
1. The Fed =/= the government
2. Members of the the Fed either are or will work to destroy Bitcoin because they are incentivised to do so.  Control over the currency gives them control over the government and Bitcoin will take away their control.
3. I'm not saying the Fed is actually plotting against Bitcoin.  I'm just saying it's in their best interest to do so.
4. You are a troll from with too much time your hands and should stop wasting people's time by asking for evidence you are going to ignore anyway.

Nope.  Quantum computers can use Shor's algorithm to trivially break ECDSA encryption.

It reminds me of tulips.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:12:55
Yes it is.  Control of the currency is control of the economy.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:12:10
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:48:30
Unless quantum computers come before quantum resistant cryptography. Which is a very plausible situation.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:51:17
It's definitely not. Compare the prices in the upper right hand corner.

The fact the banks are doing this is very well known.

Not for at least 20-30 years, probably even longer for consumer grade ones.

I'm in the same position as you here a good resource I found today.

Time is part of the rational calculation.  Getting 1$ now is now the same as getting 1$ a year from now and the cost of the time needs to be taken into account.  Humans are rational but different people value things differently.

The first 2 could be shared by fiat and bitcoin but the rest are exclusive to fiat.

Not any more.


I doubt it.
