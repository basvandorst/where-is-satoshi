The fees on purchase would make this pointless.
Save that $20s till you have maybe $4-500 then it might be worth it. Unless you can find somewhere with minimal fees.
Think about it. $20 at current rate ~$7300 buys you 0.02 Bitcoin.
If within a day the price goes to $8500 (which is a pretty wild swing) then your 0.02 btc is worth $23.30.
This is without taking into account transaction fees.
Pointless endeavour sadly.

There's nothing to stop them.
In a world where the following is arrestable, whats to stop the government making bitcoin an arrestable offence? Appropriation of bitcoin assets = profit for government so little incentive not to.
"A US police officer was arrested and charged for allegedly farting in a colleague’s face.
Lawrence Michael Jonap was accused of assaulting the officer with a notebook before passing wind."

It is on a fixed at the mo but that expires shortly. Going to fix for another 5 years but at a significantly worse rate than last time. But that doesn't diminish the point - It's still a variable tracked rate, just over a longer period of time.

For the world of crypto this may be a good thing but given the vast vast vast majority of people's who's entire lives rely on conventional banking systems, this spells ruin for mortgages, savings accounts, pensions- whilst I want to see my crypto investments go well, I don't want to be out of house and destitute off the back of it. 
Until there's a stable way of converting fiat to btc and easily moving existing mortgages pensions etc into the equivalent btc I can't see how this is a good thing... I don't want to be homeless just for the ideological reasons of doing away with conventional banking. My kids kids might benefit but people still need to live in the here and now.
As evil as it Is, compared to being homeless and penniless it is the lesser of 2 evils.

Nah, I bought in around the $6k Mark last time, I don't mind, I just don't see why others making a profit or less is seen as arrogance? I'm not bitter, I'm just questioning why some people want to see people suffer. We're not all 19 year old fan boys some of us are adults with real responsibilities in life. Spread peace and love instead?

If there was a bank run, how would my mortgage continue to operate without crippling interest rates? My salary qont be increasing in line with the rapid rate at which my mortgage payments might change... I'm certainly open to coherent and logical counter arguments to my points...? 
Not trying to start an argument or anything but just trying to separate a little bit of the ideological fan boyism of crypto to the reality of daily life. Also what happens to all the non-btc holders in the scenario of a major worldwide bank run?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:28:34
What arrogance...why would you want to see other people's hard earned cash go down the drain? I understand if you want to see rich boys who just got in on the trend suffer, but most of us are hard working who were just hoping maybe, Just maybe this could ease some of the pains of our world of endless drudgery and work for the man. Our profit or loss through btc makes no impact on you, and I don't see why me hoping to make a little chump change in this world is arrogance.
Fuck you man. Fuck you.

Ok. I'll use my ethics to keep me and my family warm at night.

I'm in the UK. I didn't buy a house I couldn't afford. We're there to be a bank run then I wouldn't be able to afford it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:09:17
Question is.. When to buy back In?!
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:14:35
I fucking hate the government. They collect tax as is from every person through paye which they WASTE on bullshit... a hard working person puts THEIR hard earned capital at risk and generates a tidy profit, through NO by product of government action (ESPECIALLY in the case of Bitcoin profit) yet they expect to be paid taxes on it just so it can go into funding their £700 per night hotels when they go on delegate meetings.
Edit: yes taxes go on important things and should be paid for common good, but they've literally given no facilitation to the profit made by this guy and they'll still bend him over and stick it in him.

Oh wow thanks. Did I miss something though? I thought the whole point was the hard limit of btc in circulation... that was supposedly the entire point of it...
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:16:52
Wait! Don't rise yet! I wanted to buy some more! (Being serious, am waiting 3 days for some ISA fund to settle and withdraw so I can buy more btc - crappy 1% net interest. Pfftttt)
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:59:03
It's not my fault. I just went to work and did the best I could. I don't see why me and my family should suffer for some ideals that you and others like you believe in. Hey don't get me wrong I want btc to do as well as you do. I just don't want to suffer the consequences when they weren't of my making.

Love the solidarity brother. Keep strong.

Why is 6k the magic number? I remember being really hesitant when btc was down at $1k and didn't jump in then because of cash flow issues. Since got a better job and decided to get in at $6k last time. Maybe the party is over? Is that actually a possibility?

Ffs another taskforce with its own meeting rooms booked for £3000 a day, plus biscuits, tea, coffee, breakfast pastries, lunch served with prosecco before their evening 5 course meal with unlimited bar privileges - all funded by tax payers of course. Oh and don't forget because it's a government taskforce, every single one of these organisations will be expending out huge numbers of consultants and officials.
Thankfully these morons couldn't do anything with any gusto and it'll probably take ages to get a result. Having said that, when they can steal from people to line their own pockets I'm sure they'll act quickly "to help fund the NHS and important public services!" - forget about eliminating waste expenditure in government! 
How dare I try and make a few bob with my own already taxed income. Fuckers.
MAKES ME SICK.

Chill the fuck out. I asked a question I wasn't sure about the answer to.
Lay off the roids they make your winky small.

Bullshit. $8.9k

Thanks for the succinct answer. I'll look into it

Ethos will hopefully be the answer. Great team and platform from the looks of things
