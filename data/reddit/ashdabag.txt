How many sisteme have you tried and of The answer is yes, what are your impressions?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:34:30
Sell sell sell! Cut your looses!
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:29:53
Don't listen to people who tell you to hold, just because they are too invested in bitcoin. Waiting is loosing money for now. Let the price fall and then buy. Sell sell sell sell!
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:21:11
When the stock markets rise btcoin drops. Sell sell sell amd then buy buy buy. And wait for the stocks to drop again.

In the past maybe. But do you think its the same in the present?
@_date: 2019-11-12 08:28:10
Cause I have a conscience and I am biologically considered alive.
@_date: 2019-11-12 08:15:41
I don't really know why i'm still holding.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:53:37
how do you know the real market price? maybe it's lower
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:54:34
yeah, just that i didn't buy at 3500 :))
@_date: 2019-11-12 09:36:53
Cause the price is down and it keeps going down?
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:49:45
From where?
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:35:49
I bailed out with my profit, waiting for a drop now. Pls sell!
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:18:29
I'm not a long term investor.
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:53:36
Now it's time to buy and hold at least to ~ 10100 $.
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:33:56
Nice, now you can short it and actually make some money!
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:35:33
Because normal currency is easier to track...
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:50:34
Your story is bs. But you are right, now it's a good time to buy.
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:51:25
Time to buy guys!
@_date: 2019-09-19 14:52:58
Depends on the region.
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:49:37
So it's stabilising
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:22:41
So what do you think NOW about my sell? (A week has passed)
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:51:06
I wanted to earn fast. Now i have no choice but to be invested for the long run. Lets hope that prophecy was legit.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:04:28
Somewhere around 400$
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:24:32
It's nice to earn money. Better than to loose money. I could be greedy and hold longer, but i don't think the risk is worth it. Anyone is free to act as they see fit.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:52:09
Took my money, now i wait for the fall.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:58:49
I know, but I don't trade in the past and I am happy with anything that's a plus.
I think the curent resistance is around 9600. When i see the price stagnates around there, I will buy again. Untill then I find the market too volatile to get back in.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:08:06
For the long run it's def worth it to hold, hold, hold. At least that's what the history tells us. But then again there is that saying 'past performance is no guarantee of future returns'
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:37:02
The prophecy is a lie? I am loosing money!
