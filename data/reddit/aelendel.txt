One of the classic Nazi traits is lying about their targets. Breathlessly, repeatedly, brazenly, just as you’ve done here. So your claims you despise yourself are probably true.
But -you- -can- -stop-. You can choose to not be that person. It’s up to you, of course. But I honestly wish you well on what I hope
Is a journey of self discovery. You can be a good person, if you choose to do so.

More tech stock verbatim from 1999. I love it. 
PS, stores of value should never decrease by 30% over a month. They should also never increase by 30% over a month. It's not a store of value, it's a bet.

You should go see the criticism Buffet was receiving in 2000 for predicting the dot-com crash in 1998.
You sound exactly like the drones who didn’t understand what he was saying then—and he’s basically saying the same thing now.

You will never oppose evil if you can't read, you can't feel, you can't think. I am so sorry.

I've lived through dot.com, real estate, and am going to live through this one too. Tulips, man, it's an old story but a goody. 
Buffet doesn't need to say much. His voluminous yearly letters to stock holders and his seminal [Superinvestors...]( describe clearly and in detail how he values opportunities. All you have to do is apply what he's tried to teach you. You should also get Graham's _Intelligent_Investor_ (Get Zweig's annotated version).  
He was also exorciated in 1999, and things people said then were 
"he didn't explain", "he admitted he doesn't understand technology". But he does understand investing. 
I made money in the tech boom, in the real estate boom, and I've made money in cryptos as well. I think it's really classic projection to think that someone who doesn't think like you was "asleep": surely, if they just knew what you did, they would have taken action! 
Guess what, sometimes people know what you do but see a different pattern. You're riding high now, but your time is gonna come. I don't really care, but do read the material I mentioned. It will help you.

It was detailed elsewhere. You know that. Please go look again. 
You've decided that someone who was thrilled to be anti-Nazi is your enemy. You've found a child in a war where they might be killed at any time, and they are your enemy. 
But the victim of the Nazis... is your enemy. 
I hope for you, i really do. Good luck.

[The Authoritarians]( don't. And they are making a serious go at taking over the United States government. 
And hilariously they are doing it by claiming to value libertarian ideals, hehehe.

Will it get old?
Or will the meaning of "doge" change over time, and be enhanced with great meaning and depth?
The memetic "gold" didn't always mean "safe store of currency" as we see it now. It was a rare, special,metal, the thing of kings. 
It is possible that doge dies just because people get tired of it. But it is also quite possible that it becomes something that last and sticks. 
But what is keeping btc alive? What does it have that doge doesn't? High adoption rate, first mover advantage, bigger market cap. But doge can still have two of those if it keeps growing... and the third only provides the other two. 
The point being that if you ignore everything the "meme" brings to the table... doge is still looking pretty good right now.
