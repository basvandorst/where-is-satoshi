None of my business, but I personally would at all costs not give into blackmail.
Anyways you may have to split it up and most likely will only be able to use visa and mastercard.
You can use [Circle]( [Coinbase]( and [Uphold](
Most sites have a very low limit for credit cards, especially on new accounts, but if you split it up among several sites this should help. 
If you can't find enough places to split it up in order to get 4 BTC then you can do a cash advance and use LocalBitcoins to deposit cash into someones account or use debit card on one of the sites listed. Be careful with those credit cards ;).
Please also keep in mind you cannot trust a thief. 
I wish you the best of luck!

You have zero way of proving where most of bitcoin comes from. freaking trollz I swear...
Feel free to stay with fiat that wants to get rid of $100's and $50's because according to some government officials that would help prevent money laundering and criminal activities.
If you want to give up your freedom stay with fiat and stop trolling people that want otherwise.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:37:45
Well with a credit card you are going to be paying a fee of around 3% (maybe a tad less or higher).
I recommend [Circle]( for low to mid amounts. Now fee for debit card, but does have a fee for credit cards.
If you want to use them often they have a mobile app.
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:29:23
I'm not sure what countries [Circle]( supports. I know [Uphold]( supports a lot of currencies and countries. Keep in mind Uphold charges a 1% withdraw fee.
You can give those two a shot while you wait for someone that has more experience with Germany comments.

@_date: 2016-08-08 03:52:24
I'm not sure what kind of information it grabs from your device (if any). I guess someone could try to dig through it if they wanted to, but I don't know if anyone ever has posted about it.
To be fair bitcoin in general is only semi-anonymous. People use tumblers to hide their identity and some even convert it to other currencies and back again.
You would also have to make sure you have different wallets for each transaction which HD wallets do this (sort of).

I had this happen to me once. I had to contact support and took a couple of weeks (if I remember) to get it sorted. 
Once it got sorted for some reason my limit was noticeably increase from what it was prior. 
In the meantime you can always use Circle, kraken, or gemini.

What about converting them to USD and then bitcoin?
* $50 Macy's - $37.50
* $25 Marshalls - $17.50
They don't accept iTunes and the Dunkin Donuts giftcard would have to be at least $25 for them to accept. Anyways their are other sites that do the same that may accept them.
The only sites I know that you can sell gift cards for bitcoin is [LocalBitcoins]( and [Paxful]( For those gift cards I doubt you would get a good rate on.

I wish I knew more details about it, but it doesn't seem like they fought it at all (at least from what I have read).
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:53:58
1. I would recommend Trezor or Ledger as both are solid. I am not sure which one is best security wise (if it can be even be proven). I like the look, size, and design of the ledger nano. I am tempted to buy one.
I don't have any cold storage yet, but will soon enough.
2. I haven't had the chance to use Bit Wage or anything similar, so I am not sure. I normally buy bitcoin and then use bitcoin to buy other coins.

I have dusted off my circle account since all the rumors and fee increase and haven't had any complaints. They seem a tad above market value, but still cheaper then coinbase (unless using GDAX) since they don't charge a fee for debit and ACH. 
Even if their weren't any rumors going on with coinbase I would still be sad that they increased their fee especially since they have competitors. 
I haven't had many issues with Coinbase either and my limit on their site is at least quadruple circle's.
I'm still upset about uphold having (last time I checked) a withdraw fee...
@_date: 2016-08-20 09:27:24
This isn't really a solution, but you could send all your funds to one of your wallet addresses and then send them to whatever address you want. This is make them all send from the same address.
If you click on your wallet, click on menu icon (top right), and then click on Unspent Outputs, you can see all the addresses that have funds.

It is an exchange owned and ran by coinbase.
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:30:56
true. The problem I have personally is I have to use debit or ACH since I don't do enough to make wire transfers worth it. If I do ACH then it takes up to 5 business days and by then bitcoin price probably changes. 
At least how coinbase was before I could purchase with ACH at whatever price bitcoin was at that moment.

Personally I use mycelium as my main storage for bitcoin and then Jaxx for quick transactions since they also include ether and have a chrome plugin.
I will most likely switch to a mix of Mycelium and cold storage when Mycelium releases their new wallet since it SHOULD allow you to hold ether as well. This of course also depends on how PoS will work for Ether, but unrelated to this discussion.
My opinion is Mycelium for bitcoin is quick, secure, convenient, and allows for cold storage (supports ledger, trezor, keepkey, etc).
If you only want to store on a computer you can always use bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:59:31
As Simon said they have a pin code feature, but I wonder if they will support cold storage one day as it seems to be actively developed.
@_date: 2016-08-11 02:50:51
Is the exchange rate higher than the real exchange rate with a credit card that doesn't charge international fees?
@_date: 2016-08-26 16:05:11
You can use Circle.com with credit card
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:18:34
Overall I personally think it is a good idea. I would try to put a small amount of that perhaps in other cryptocurrencies. An amount that you are not afraid of losing.
I would also try and use some cold storage (paper wallet, ledger, trezor, etc).
I think you would be able to get more bitcoin if you move the 5% - 10% to a separate account that you used to buy bitcoin on dips though. Bitcoin is suppose to go up in value compared to regular fiat, but it is still volatile and has many dips (went from $800 to $480 back to $570 recently).
I believe in BTC and ETH, so I am invested in both as well as a small amount in a couple other cryptocurrencies. 
It is a gamble, but I think  the probability is high that our investments will pay off in the future :).
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:27:28
I'll give them some respect for having that originally as few sites have this.

I bought some stuff off of Amazon through purse.io.  I already had the Bitcoin in it,  so not sure how long it took. 
I couldn't imagine buying something locally with Bitcoin and waiting for confirmations.  I could increase the price,  but I think that is already high for average speed...
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:56:43
I doubt there is much you can do unless you go through legal channels since coinbase does keep records of everyone who uses their service, but this would most likely not be worth it and no guarantee still that you would get anything.
I would still let coinbase know, so they can watch that user and maybe they will do something about them in the future, so he/she at least won't be allowed to use their service anymore.

@_date: 2016-08-09 22:00:04
Well you can usually get a lil over market value if you use [LocalBitcoins]( (p2p trading) and [Circle]( is usually a tad above market value. Both of these 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:01:05

* Magnr I believe offers some form of margin trading.
* Gemini might offer it

You can send in usd on circle.  I am not sure about Cad tho.  Different places will have different rates and circle price of btc changes based on market value

Here are a couple of ways to buy bitcoin:
* Gemini
* GDAX (owned by coinbase)
* Kraken 
 - Mostly used for high volumes
 - They use wire transfers to deposit fiat
* Circle
  - No fees for Debit or ACH
* Coinbase
* Uphold
  - 1% withdraw fee
* LibertyX
  - Many locations and you buy bitcoin with cash
  - Some locations may not know what LibertyX is, but you can contact support for help if you have issues
P2P (mostly):
* LocalBitcoins
  - Best ways (I think) are to do cash deposit into someone's bank account or meet in person
* Paxful
  - Similar to LocalBitcoins
* Mycelium
  - An android app that has a My Trader feature built in to allow local trading
  - None in my area uses it (live in the country-ish)
I probably forgot a few, but those are some of the ways that I suggest. 
Once you purchase bitcoin make sure to move it to your own private wallet (that you own) or if you are trading it you can move it to an exchange, but if storing it always keep it in a private wallet otherwise you do not OWN it.
LATELY I have been using Circle the most, but I really should get my Gemini account sorted as they are a good option as well.
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:46:28
As of right now I'm not currently using them anymore due to higher fees. I have only had one huge issue with them where they limited my account for a couple of weeks (or more I can't remember) to like $10 lmao.
Lately I have been using Circle, but as someone else stated LocalBitcoins isn't a bad option. You can do cash deposit into someone's bank account, but their is usually higher markup on LocalBitcoins then Circle.
Some other options are Gemini, uphold, and kraken (wire transfers).
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:04:53
If you find something better let me know if you don't mind :). I was searching around for the same thing last week. 
The ones I have found that give you an okay ratio require you to either mail in the card and get paid instantly-ish (ACH), give them the card info online and wait to get paid in the mail, or send card in mail and wait for check in mail.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:40:51
Bitcoin problems... :D
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:49:12
I like the UI. It doesn't offer as many features as some wallets, but it supports BTC, ETH, DAO (not that it matters anymore), and will support DASH. 
Jaxx is actively being developed, so I am sure it changed a good amount since last time you used it.
I mostly use it for easy transactions since they have a chrome plugin. I use Mycelium to store larger amounts of BTC that I don't move around much. I need to invest in some sort of cold storage one day (ledger, trezor, etc). 
I am excited to see what Mycelium does with their new wallet/platform when it is released as so far their current one is my favorite for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-26 13:19:48
I use one chrome extension to scan qr codes and another one to generate them.
Circle also has a mobile app.  When I use that I just copy and paste. 
So qr codes or copy and paste.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:52:25
Well coinbase has increased their fees, so I don't use them anymore (for now).
Normally ACH takes 3 - 5 business days, but for some reason coinbase is crazy about this and it takes longer for you to get your bitcoin.
I use [Circle]( right now as they allow you to buy instantly with debit card with no additional fee (are a tad above market value, but not by much usually).
People that buy in LARGE amounts I believe use wire transfer usually and go through exchanges like Kraken or Gemini.
If you want to look at some other ways to buy bitcoins:
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:44:07
because they are cold storage. It is like having a laptop that is plugged into the internet vs having a laptop that never connects to the internet and that never has anything new installed on it (besides security updates).
Cold storage isn't connect to anything and you have to connect it to another wallet everytime you want to withdraw from it and disconnect when done.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:42:09
I recommend Mycelium it supports trezor, keepkey, and ledger. It is a mobile wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:37:40
like he said an "Educational Package"... Notice how he called it a token and then referred to ether as a token as well instead of a coin or gas.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:47:54
I haven't used copay (should probably check it out). I like Jaxx as well as the other ones you listed and do not think you can go wrong with any of those 3.
I believe this is the link to Mycelium for itunes?
I am not sure why it isn't listed on their website (strange?).
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:53:36
I can't speak for how secure it is, but I use it for quick transactions since they have a plugin and mobile app. I use Mycelium to keep larger sums though.
I haven't had any or heard of any issues with Jaxx and it is actively developed.

Own the private keys to your  bitcoin (in a private wallet) and you won't have that issue.
If governments want to try and regulate cryptocurrency more than have at it. They will only make their currency worth less and ours worth more.
They love expanding government and in return spending/loaning funny money to do it.
Our currency in USA is currently "regulated" and you know one issue we are having right now is that we have more money in circulation (credit) then actually exists even with us printing money.
The best part about all of that is that we have to print more money and keep interest rates low to try and prevent deflation. The "problem" with deflation is that people who owe money would be screwed and the government owns a lot of money. They would also have to give up some of their power if it happened and we all know they like to hang onto that.
"The best government is that which governs least"
power = corruption 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:02:39
Some places require this info and it makes me cringe. This is part of the reason why I don't have Tether. Coinbase hasn't asked me this info yet. Maybe it is because of the state you live in or maybe it is another reason I'm not sure.
If you are doing low amounts weekly you can use [Circle]( After you do a transaction or two you can request to raise your limit which I believe is based on USD even tho it shows it in BTC (currently at 5.2 BTC).
I'm not sure what you should put. I guess you could always put something like self-employeed, but I am not sure if their is any legal impact of doing this. I have just noticed that when you are self-employeed a lot of times you do not have to give as much info unless they start requiring documents to proof income like a mortgage.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:55:00
Wow that is strange to me how they up the fees on one and not the other especially given how integrated GDAX is with coinbase.

Some credit cards don't charge any fees other than w.e. their exchange rate is at.

[Circle]( is probably the easiest and they do not have fees for using debit cards (instant transactions). They also have a mobile app.

which do you like better? I'm using Mycelium and haven't had any issues, but I haven't tried copay yet.

They have chrome extension for this and I assume firefox
@_date: 2016-08-26 00:43:24
Wow... Did you try telling them that you want to withdraw your Bitcoin and close down your account then?
I would think if you contact support you should at least be able to withdraw funds.
@_date: 2016-08-23 11:24:26
I haven't seen any good reviews about it. It also seems to be closed source?
As of now I wouldn't trust it personally.

For sure. I love not having to wait a week for my BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:25:39
I agree.
It seems that this happens a lot though. For example on the USA side I believe the top 3 exchanges are Kraken, Poloniex, and Gemini. Those at least seem to hold a large amount of funds (I have not statistics on this).
Now a lot of people including myself are using Circle instead of spreading it out, but at least we can only buy some much BTC per account with Circle a week and we get it back out quickly (or at least I assume most people withdraw it quickly).
I know I rely on Poloniex a lot more than I should because they allow me to lend out my crypto. Luckily Ethereum will come out with PoS one day and I won't have so much in Poloniex.
I hope as time goes on their is more competition to spread risk out.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:28:17

* A wallet like: Mycelium (mobile), CoPay (cross-platform), breadwallet (iOS), jaxx (cross-platform). 
 - If you install a mobile bitcoin wallet please make sure that it is from a reliable company and you control your keys. Please also make sure it is truely from that company as iOS especially has been having a lot of scam wallets lately.
* You need to buy the bitcoin: * Once you have your wallet setup and you buy your bitcoin you can either send those bitcoins to your wallet address or to the person that you are paying.

You can transfer your private key to mycelium (android app) or Jaxx (android app and chrome plugin).
Google how to import wallet from bitcoin core to mycelium (or jaxx).
The bitcoin core wallet will download the entire blockchain (which is a good thing). The two bitcoin wallets I listed do not have to download the blockchain. If you are using an iphone their is also breadwallet (never used it, but heard good things).

I never used my account until recently (old account though), but right after my first transaction I submitted a request for my limit to be increased. my limit was increased instantly to what it said was it's max currently "4.7930 BTC". I am assuming the limit is based on USD and not BTC.
I'm also curious if this is indeed their max weekly limit like an e-mail said or not.

I store have a significant amount on exchanges for trading purposes,  but I also have a significant amount in my personal wallets and other investments. 
Having money on exchanges is risky and you could lose it all.  You can diversify which helps balance the risk since you won't lose all of your money due to an exchange. 
Is it worth the risk?  You have to decide that.  It is barely worth the risk for me and if something happens I might regret it.
@_date: 2016-08-21 07:37:23
I think using circle.com would be pretty easy and straight forward.  If he can download the app to make it even easier.  Their wouldn't be any fees that I am aware of.
I used PayPal a lot previously. You can gift someone money into their PayPal account. 
Some banks allow you to send people money for free.  You send it to their email and then they click the link and tell them what bank account they want it to go to.

I like btcpop. You can lose or gain money using it. it is kind of like lending club, but with Bitcoin. You lend small amounts of btc among several solidish people to account for someone not paying. They also have a savings and instant loan pool. As well as other features.
Magnr is around as well, but apr I think is only 1% roughly.
You can lend a small amount on exchanges, but their is always a risk doing that. I usually have a little on poloniex lending out (not much).

Unless they changed something or it is region based Credit Cards are just for backup payments.
The only options it gives me is ACH Transfer (in USA) and backup Credit Card payment in case something goes wrong with the bank transfer.
It doesn't give you the option for any sort of wire transfer? We have ACH here in USA (banks usually don't charge for ACH).

You don't have to do it only through LocalBitcoins nor do you have to do it at one time or to the same person/organization.

* Coinbase (1% fee, but market prices)
* Coinbase Exchange - GDAX (.25% fee to free)
* Uphold.com (1% withdraw fee)
* Circle.com (free last I checked if using bank account, but usually a little above market value)
* Gemini Exchange - I don't like it personally because it may not as easy to use as rest and a lot of verification
* Kraken Exchange - A lot of people seem to use this for high volume, but can be used for low volume as well
If you want to buy with cash you can use:
* Localbitcoins - find someone local, send cash via mail, bank deposit, and/or wire transfer (other ways to, but they have premiums)
* Mycelium Trader (Android/iOS app) - buy and sell locally (prices are usually higher then market value)

To my knowledge unless you are a Venezuelan citizen you cannot get a bank account anymore with them.

Coinbase  has GDAX (coinbase's exchange) which allows you to set your buy order price once your USD is in your account or sell order price if you are selling.
Their is also uphold.com, but their 1% withdraw fee I think is steep.
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:15:17
you could also move it to an exchange and then take it out again or move it through a scrambler.

an exchange. they had or are having server issues.
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:14:45
The government controls their exchange rate. The official exchange rate is 1 usd for 10 Bovier (or w.e.). I think a month ago it was realistically 1 USD for 1000 via black market exchange rate.
Say you fly their and then exchange your USD for their currency you would not be able to change it back to USD.
Their currency is utter crap now and almost worthless. They also are having a hard time importing items. It is very interesting and sad times for Venezuela and I think we should all learn more about what is going on.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:33:37
You can contact support and they might be able to help you get it raised a little, but may not be instantly.
When my account was new it was limited, but slowly was raised overtime. 
Their is also places like Kraken, uphold.com (they charge 1% fee to withdraw last I knew), and circle. I almost forgot about Gemini, but meh I personally don't like them since I can't access my account easily.
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:06:07
it is linked to your coinbase account and is an exchange.
It allows you to trade between BTC, ETH, and FIAT instantly as long as your funds are in your account. 
Say you think Wednesday at 3am the price is going to go down to say $690, but right now the price is at $740 and you have a couple dollars or grands sitting in your GDAX account you can set a buy order at say $695 and hope it goes through wednesday.
If you see that bitcoin value is going up and down you could also try to take advantage of this and try to buy low and sell high via fiat or eth. You could do the same with ETH, but if you are doing that it may be better to move your bitcoin/eth that you want to trade to an exchange like poloniex or kraken.
I would also make sure that you keep any cryptocurrency that you are not expecting to trade off of exchanges just in case and instead in a local wallet ;).
@_date: 2016-06-19 20:43:09
agreed. 
Coinbase, uphold, circle, Gemini, libertyx, and tether to name a few.
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:56:01
If you want to purchase with cash you have LocalBitcoins, and Myceleium Trader (not as popular and probably not easy for large volumes to do this).
Kraken (exchange), Coinbase or GDAX (Coinbase exchange), and their is Gemini (Exchange). I believe those are some of the best for LARGE volumes. 
For smaller volumes their is also circle and uphold.com, but personally I like coinbase better RIGHT NOW plus it has an exchange.
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:02:27
I must have missed it. I was watching a video about the economics haha.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:33:36
I use both, but lately have been using Coinbase/GDAX more.
If you deposit your fiat into Coinbase then you can trade it on GDAX exchange whenever you want.
I think circle is quicker though, but if you don't mind waiting you may be able to get a better price at coinbase.
Their is also uphold.com, but they charge a 1% withdraw fee last time I checked.
Coinbase usually takes me like 5 or 6 business days when doing ACH (not wire transfer) from bank account. I am unsure why it takes so long as I would expect something closer to 3 -  5 business days via ACH.
You can use a Credit Card I believe to get funds faster via bank transfer, but they don't accept AMEX, so I haven't used that feature.

You can import the private key into another wallet. That amount got sent to your wallet (public key) which has a private key. 
Find a light weight wallet and import the private key. Be careful though because if someone else gets access to your private key then they have access to the funds associated with it.

Haha. I am a student and move around a lot, so verifying certain things are difficult. I don't usually have any utility bills as it is cheaper and easier to rent rooms from people. 
Then on top of that my license isn't going to say the same address as w.e. address I am technically at even though that doesn't matter since I won't have a utility bill lmao.
I can get a bank account easier then I can sign up for most of these sites. I find that confusing... I can't even verify who I am with Gemini without a utility bill that matches my address...

Yup it says my limit may increase after 7 days (5 days ago), so we shall see what happens in 2 days. I don't have a visa or mastercard credit card though, so Coinbase does nothing for me that others do not. If they accepted AMEX then I'd be mad that I couldn't use my account.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:08:29
If selling I think Localbitcoins is awesome. You can get people to mail you cash or do cash deposit into your bank account. People pay a little extra I guess for privacy reasons, so you make profit usually.
They also have local trading feature if anyone nearby want to trade with you.
@_date: 2016-02-23 08:35:14
I think  videos (unbiased as possible) in a discussion format would be one of the best ways to get information out. If not unbiased then from different people's point of view.
Out of all the articles and reddit discussions I have read I still have almost no idea about any of it. Most seem to be arguing instead of getting information out.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:25:14
The only two ways I know of that you can purchase with a credit card is Circle (charges 3%ish fee) w/ mastercard and visa and Purse.io (you purchase items for someone else in exchange for bitcoin. Purse.io is usually marked up a good amount though. Circle does want you to verfiy who you are, but not to the extent as most.
Cash and Banks Accounts seem to be the best ways to buy. Bank accounts seem to generally be the cheapest option via ACH.

Looking at the small picture my student loans would be very "unfriendly". Larger picture most things has increased quite dramatically in price.

I wouldn't always agree with that. I believe it requires more work/money to secure as well as trust by their clients. 
Open Source software has backdoors (probably unintentionally most of the time), but can be easier to find since everyone has access to the code. As well easier to fix (hopefully).
I can't really argue "security through obscurity" as I think it is a horrible practise, but Proprietary software can use this as an "advantage" more than Open Source can. Again horrible practice, but look at the past OpenSSL issue.
I prefer Open Source over Proprietary, but their is no Open Source alternative to Apple (well besides ubuntu, but doesn't seem to be doing that well).
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:07:37

I don't see how it would get shut down if done right since bitcoin is a "property" and not a "currency". Wouldn't it be like accepting copper and then creating Company B that buys the copper from Company A and sells it off?
@_date: 2016-02-18 11:34:42
If I was in the business I would accept bitcoin especially given issues with regulations as well as visa, mastercard, etc... 
I'm pretty sure services like bitpay solve the issue of how much bitcoin goes up and down since it can automatically be converted into other currencies.

Yeah if they did have ACH I would be more tempted to verify my life to them haha. I just don't like the websites that require you to upload your utility bill w/ your address on it. Some even require two forms of proof of residency.

It started after verification ID came into effect. I uploaded my ID and it said verified. That was like 5 days ago. a couple days before that I deposited like $500 for bitcoins.
The limit is just for depositing and I guess withdrawing via bank account. In other words I can still add/withdraw bitcoins no problem. I sent an email to support and just got some vague message. I finally replied to them again today and will wait for a response.
Other people seem to be having issues with them since new verification setup, but from what I heard they can all access their bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:43:00
Oh okay. Makes sense :)
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:34:23
I'll add it, but they require wire transfers (not ACH) which I personally think is a waste of money. I think kraken is much better for trading between digital currencies than depositing withdrawing via fiat currency. 
They also require in my opinion a ridiculous amount of verifications to get to tier 3. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 06:36:47
Could always encrypt your backup with some sort of encryption software of your choosing. I backup my private keys to keepass 2 (using passphrase and key file). 
If I had more money in it then I would probably diversify my backups between multiple keepass databases. Their are better options, but it is more convenient for me this way.
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:04:19
Their is also uphold.com which is usually cheaper then circle and sometimes same price as coinbase. 
My coinbase account is all messed up because of reverification, so can't use that account until it sorts it self out. I contacted support and their response was not informative, so not worth the frustration to contact them again...
Their is also local bitcoins, but prices seem higher for some reason even for wire transfer or cash deposit/mail. 
You could try buying local as well through them or mycelium app.

I don't see how it could be comparable. IPv4 can't directly go to IPv6. One is not compatible with the other. We also haven't really switched to IPv6 yet and unsure if/when we will.
Hasn't bitcoin had a hard fork in the past? I think a closer relation should be going from usb1 to usb 1.1 or usb 2 to usb 3. Something that is backwards compatible. Even then I think it would be a very far off example. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:41:38
Yeah as long as I can withdraw it in bitcoin though I am not to upset since there are plenty of alternatives. I think it may be an issue with their new ID verification, but honestly who knows. Support is just uber slow it seems.
I hope it isn't due to running out of "liquid cash" haha. I read about that when reading old reddit posts. I would have been pretty pissed, but they don't seem like they are the only ones who have done such things :(.

@_date: 2016-02-19 05:04:41

The seller might ask for ID verification on localbitcoins and if Bitquick thinks that a transaction looks odd they can request ID Verification.

I agree with you really shouldn't "store" your wallet in a web based one. For storage you should use an offline one that you can backup your private key(s). Otherwise you could lose your funds if the site shutsdown, gets hacked, or just decides to screw you.

You can make money off of someone more then once which should help. Say someone buys BTC with fiat, then converts that to LTC, and then exchanges that for some other crypto or fiat. You could have charged them 3 times just for that (just an example).
I hope their are other ways for revenue, but exchanges for example have a lot of money going threw them and at .15% - .25% it adds up overtime.
I'm assuming this investment will be a long term one. If they have another crowdsale and their service is valued higher then before our shares will be worth more. Hopefully things are more clear as time goes on. might be able to give more detail on the subject.

Thanks for the answer.

Good answer :D

Personally I think this is more honest then throwing out a number which in most cases is wrong. I'm sure you have your own estimates, but saying them publicly and if they are in accurate or taken out of context could be an unnecessary issue ;).
I look forward to hearing/seeing more details as time goes on.

I'll stick with using litecoin and paying almost nothing in fees.

Why the name calling? What makes him/her "ungrateful"?

I thought hacking people was illegal? :D

Is wave going to be the only option for Fiat? I thought Wave was going to be just another module, plugin, or whatever.

Which deal with an Asics manufacture? I remember them making "resistant". Fees are to insane for me to use bitcoin for now. Until/if they come down I can't afford to use it, so I have to seek alternatives.

For that much without ID  I agree LocalBitcoins is probably the way to go. You can do cash deposit to someones bank account.
The problem with that is even that you can get it same day within the next hour I doubt would be possible due to banks not being open yet.
You can transfer money from serve2serve through LocalBitcoins though.
If you have cash you might be able to find someone on LocalBitcoins or Mycelium (mobile app) locally.
In the future just so you know I never had to show my ID (so far) to circle although I did have to verify my identity via last four of my social. Anyways my limit with them is now about 4.5 BTC a week and can purchase isntantly via debt (no fee) or credit card (fee). My restriction when I first opened the account I think was about $200 or $300.

Simple and straight to the point i like it :)

And you don't have to create a "hostile take-over" for bitcoin to get segwit. I think I'd rather just chill in the  alt-coin world until it comes time for the "contingency plan".

Yeah I have had some issues here and their. I would love to use tether, but the verification process "for me" is just insane. I am a student and my residence isn't necessary the same  as where I live. 
Although this "may" allow me to switch what state I say I live in. This "may" allow me to access some exchanges and features that would otherwise be restricted to my state of residence.
I've noticed some places allow you to use a pdf version of your bank statement for address verification, so you can change the address for your bank account and then download the next bank statement and use that.
I also opted to use my passport for verification instead of my license since it doesn't say what state I am a residence of.
