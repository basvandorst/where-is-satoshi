This is really a dyor sortof situation. I don't know any I would trust off the top of my head; I use one I wrote myself
There is certainly security risk if you use someone else's. If you are downloading a full executable that someone says is a custom interface, you will likely never know that they are siphoning your private keys. Don't ever do this. The only way you should ever use other people's code for this sort of thing is by building it from the binaries after reading all the source code yourself. If you feel that you aren't skilled enough to accurately evaluate someone else's code (for security, or even just for performance) I would say that you probably should not mess with trying to do this yourself. Find someone you trust to work with to develop your own (simple ones are pretty easy for someone with any experience using APIs) and then you will have a lot more peace of mind and customizability
This is kinda just the price to play in markets that are sophisticated enough. It would be ludicrous to try to trade high-frequency on the stock market through an interactive broker on a website, and the Bitcoin markets are starting to get to the same levels of liquidity and volume that it is infeasible here too

The real answer here is to use the APIs for these exchanges directly instead of manually trading through their website, but I know that is a useless answer if you don't can't/won't program a custom interface (or buy one)
At the end of the day though, the highest volume and most profitable traders (at least who daytrade) are using these tools, so they will simply always get their orders in faster and more reliably than you can from an interface
