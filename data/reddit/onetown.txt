Apple generally checks if the app doesn't crash, doesn't access APIs it shouldn't, and that it does what it's advertised as doing.
For all intents and purposes, these wallets are legitimate apps. The problem is just that they produce fraudulent Bitcoin addresses, and apple obviously need to adjust their  protocols when it comes to these kinds of apps.

I got a PS4 last month. Sony refuses to accept any of my credit/debit cards. They even rejected my attempts to pay with PayPal. 
So infuriating to want to give someone money, and have them seemingly not wanting to take it.
While Steam never has had a problem with taking my money, funding my account with bitcoin is the most effortless way I have ever done it. Just a tap on my phone, a tap on the fingerprint reader, one tap to confirm. 
And it's done, money left my hands, entered bitpays hands. No more to it on my end. 
I don't know if this is the future, but I know I want it to be.

Doesn't really matter, until lightning network is a thing, bitcoin is not usable as a payment option for even 100 dollar amounts, especially through BitPay, as they charge a $10 fee (just checked) on top of whatever fee you have to pay yourself (which is also at least $10 lately). 
So you really have to be out of other options if you're willing to pay 20 bucks to load 100 dollars on your MS account.

I would have said it then, and I will say it now; Don't risk money you can't afford to lose.
It's easy to point to this guy as a success story, but what about the schmuck who maxed out their credit card to buy bitcoins at $800, only to find themselves in a hole half a year later with no option but to cash out at $400 to cover their bills.
You might believe that Bitcoin will succeed, but there's no guarantees and any money you put in is at high risk. And you're certainly not guaranteed a return in the short-term, as the last year has shown.

I don't understand what your point is. That people should have been "nice" and let everyone mine on a laptop? And hope that everyone else was nice? What purpose does lamenting the invention of ASICs have, they are a natural result of the security structure that makes bitcoin work; the more hashpower you have, the more reward you will get.
And if you don't think the greedy nature of free capitalism will work in favor of bitcoin, you should get out while you can because that's all that is there.
Edit: Also, even if ASICs didn't exist, you STILL wouldn't be able to mine with a computer because there would always be someone who had a million more GPUs than you.

Yes, money does have a huge influence on politics right now. But it would be a whole different thing if dollars and dineros translated into votes.

Sent 0.015 back to breadwallet with 0.0002 fee.
No delays. In fact I have never had a quicker chain of transactions. Subtracting the initial 75bit fee, this little test also made me 4925 bits. ;)

Nobody here is proving your point, not even you.
Right now, 1 satoshi is the smallest amount of bitcoin you can theoretically send/spend. If we add another digit, 1 satoshi could be divided into 10 units. This does not change the value of a satoshi, nor does it give anyone more purchasing power, other than the power to spend less bitcoin.
If a dozen eggs was worth 1 satoshi before, it is 1 worth satoshi after. 6 eggs would then be worth 0.5 satoshi.
I don't know what deflation has to do with any of this, apart from possibly necessitating the concept in the first place.

I don't see how anyone can argue for a higher blocksize than the one segwit provides at this very moment, given how some users seems quite happy to fill up the available space with spam transactions.
You'll just end up with the same fee pressure plus a much bigger blockchain.

I don't know, it's a pretty ok summary of the Craig Wright debacle with a "Bitcoin has been having some issues" tacked on at the end.
Despite the headline, the article doesn't seem to make any claims.

First off, "Bitcoin's ransomwares"?
Secondly, if I were to recommend something, it would be to backup your computer regularly, that way you don't have to pay, you just need to restore your backup.
Obviously, that's no help if you've already been hacked, so yes you're left with no choice but to pay if you want your data back.

I don't think he will. We already knew (and ignored) much of his intentions, so why would that change now.
Will Core suddenly change their mind about a hard fork now that Satoshi is "back"?
For better or worse, Bitcoin has outgrown Satoshi, and there's bigger forces controlling the project now.

The escrow serves a purpose: not getting screwed over by sellers.
That it doesn't protect against getting screwed over by the escrow holder doesn't negate that purpose.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:53:18
It depends on the amount of inputs/outputs. The transaction you linked had 5 inputs, therefore needs a higher fee.
A more usual transaction will have 1 input and two outputs, therefore needing less space and smaller fee.
Your fee wasn't unreasonable, it was just about right. A little more and it would confirm faster, a little less and it could have taken hours or even days.

The point was that an institution having x customers doesn't make them invincible, not that mega was bigger than PayPal, Facebook has half the world, and is considered the successor of MySpace.
If paypal shuns mega, that makes Bitcoin a more valuable payment option. It may not be a "killer app" but it surely does exemplify the value of Bitcoin.

You're fucking ridiculous, we've had early signaling for a couple of days and suddenly anyone who's being cautious with their own business is an enemy of bitcoin. We've waited over half a year for segwit to activate, and you're throwing a tantrum because we might have to wait a couple days extra.

Breadwallet does not, and is still using upwards to 300sat fee.
I love breadwallet more than any wallet, but their refusal to add custom fees might push me off it.

Do we really "need" proof, though?
I mean, the only thing I've gathered from this is that I don't really care who Satoshi is. It's probably Craig, and it probably won't affect me.

Decided to give it a go. I didn't bother looking up anything, so do note that specifics here is likely to be wrong, but i think i got the jist of it.
**SegWit**  
An update to the bitcoin protocol that does some stuff like fix malleability and also increases the amount of transactions that can go into a block.
**SegWit2x**  
An implementation of SegWit that also include a schedule for doubling the blocksize in addition to the increase provided by Segwit. A fair share of the miners have agreed to activate this.
**UASF**  
User Activated Soft Fork, a way of updating bitcoin, in this context it's another proposed way of activating SegWit. Instead of having miners activating it, the idea is that non-mining nodes will start enforcing SegWit and, with enough economic support, forcing the miners to come along.
**BIP148**  
BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Protocol, which is the process for updating Bitcoin Core. You make a BIP, and then people can discuss, test, and eventually merge it into the project. BIP148 is the BIP for the aforementioned UASF.
**ASIC**  
Application Specific Integrated* Chip. I'm just guessing the abbreviation here. The point is that back in the day people mined bitcoin with cpus and gpus, then people started making ASIC miners, which are equipment made specifically for mining Bitcoin, and are thus way more efficient at it.
**Bitmain**  
One of the companies making ASIC miners, and miners themselves. Supposedly they make the best miners.
**BU**  
Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative to Bitcoin Core, seeking to increase the blocksize, or rather give miners the ability to do such changes as they please. 
**Blockstream**  
Company working on blockchain stuff or something, I'm not really sure, but they employ several prominent bitcoin core developers, like Greg Maxwell and Luke Jr. Often the target of conspiracy theories from anti-segwit and pro-BU proponents, claiming that their ties with core developers are so deep they control the development and is keeping blocksize small for their own benefit. 
**Jihan Wu**  
Owner/CEO of BitMain, main villain to the pro-SegWit crowd. Despite some lack in english skills, he's very active on twitter arguing the BU perspective, and given that BitMain makes so many miners he's often blamed for SegWit not being activated yet.
