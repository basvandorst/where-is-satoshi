finally a thread on cboe futures. is there any public info on how many people bought short or long? that would b a good indication to where we're headed shorterm

the real question is how "long" are the "long positions". in reality, they're still short in relativeness to the ATH we had with BTC. pretty sure Nobody bet bitcoin would be 30k. all positions are short compared to last month

Yessir their needs to be a new exchange run by a better team. 
Coinbase has embarassed the whole crypto community with this nonsense
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:04:45
Gemini? Maybe i need to do more research.
I know they're started by the Winklevoss (got rich off bitcoin) 
CBOE is using them for their futures.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:01:18
bitcoin will touch 18k today. mock my words. btc whales dont want to end the year bearish
