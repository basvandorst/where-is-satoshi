I can get the answer for free using the code at the  StackExchange link below:
get_coordinates("1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC")
1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC 
38.8791981 -76.9818437
(38.8791981, -76.9818437)
If I put their URL into a browser I get:

I get 1.5% back on my credit card for every thing I charge. Try that with Bitcoin!!!!

That's because they convert btc to use immediately. A policy of refunding the original amount of btc exposes them to exchange rate volatility.

Is this some kind of scam? When you download it does it put malware on your phone?
I mean--why would you hand cash to some unknown "teller" found with this app? What combination of Smart Contracts-encryption-blockchain stuff happens on the backend is not relevant. You give the person the cash, they can say they entered the amount into the smart contract, but could be lying.
Furthermore, safe keeping cash, insuring against fraud, and tracking hedging operations takes resources and money.
Sorry free lunches aren't so easy to come buy.

Whenever I have mentioned bitcoin, the only responses are generally that they don't know what it is or its the thing that people use to pay for illegal activities. I can think of two exceptions who thought it was neat, but still had no interest in using it.

But I can wisely choose not to have a million dollars in bitcoin. If a blockchain system is the register of deeds I cannot choose another system.
Furthermore if you lose a lawsuit and the court ordered your property seized, you could just claim you lost the private key.
Furthermore I doubt people will put up with a system where titles could be stolen or put out of reach of a court of law.

A great way for NK to avoid the trade restrictions. Instead of shipping coal or oil, they just burn it to generate power and sell the bitcoin.

The law does not always agree with "finders keepers.". People have been prosecuted for picking up and keeping cash that has fallen out of trucks or erroneously dispensed by ATMs. I'm not sure at what point one can keep found physical property... perhaps a lawyer can comment.

"Apparently Bank of America could use Factom to prevent mortgage fraud, by hashing all the new mortgage documents and securing them somehow using Factom to prove to people no fraud was committed, this would of course prevent a global financial crisis like in 2008."
This represents a complete misunderstanding of the nature of mortgage fraud and the crisis of 2008.  Mortgage fraud is rarely if ever documents in the record keeping systems or in a way a blockchain could prevent. The most common economic fraud by  far is   lying about income or property characteristics. Most dishonest actors who trick borrowers just convince them not to read the lengthy documents when signing. The few cases of post signature alterations would be resolved by merely digitally signing the documents.

Also--I'm not sure why cost of entry would be any lower than any local currency based payment mechanism; in fact cost of entry may be higher due to the need to persuade people to use an alternate product.
Also---where is your evidence that the bitcoin payment mechanism is really cheaper.
If you look at Visa's annual report, you can see that the actual total expenses of Visa are a small part of the interchange fee (I recall less than 10 bp). This does not separate out the actual transaction costs from other costs.
Most of the 2-3% fees for Credit Card transactions go to the issuing bank and cover costs such as rewards and perks, marketing, anti-fraud, and financing people who don't pay interest
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:39:15
If you start providing all of the benefits that Paypal and Credit Cards provide consumers and then invest in the marketing to inform people, would you still have a payment mechanism that is cheaper? 
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:45:03
If you are part of the bitcoin crowd and big investors in Bitcoin, you can invest in bitcoin in far less costly ways. 
If you are not in that group you probably either 1) don't know anything about bitcoin and won't invest, or 2) realize that it is likely a worse investment than a lottery ticket and won't invest.
@_date: 2015-04-10 11:57:11
Do you have figures on regulatory costs? 
The only reason governments would exempt Bitcoin transactions from regulation would be paralysis due to contention; however, anti-money laundering, anti-fraud, and anti-terrorism rules get pretty broad bi-partisan support, so I doubt such paralysis would last long.

They can be solved just as well with conventional currencies if there is sufficient demand. In fact because bitcoin almost always needs to be converted to currency at the receivers end you have not solved anything for most people. In the end money in real currency is being exchanged and transcended----it is just happening behind the curtains and perhaps with transactions aggregated.
I was able to do a cash withdrawal from my United states bank account at a Tel Aviv ATM. Thus the technology for transfers exists.

Actually if you spend it and for some reason the check is returned afterwards the bank will pursue you for the $10K if there is not sufficient funds in your accounts to seize.
Thus, unless you want your credit trashed, spending the 10K quickly does no good. Depositing the check immediately would help if the check writer later goes bust or overdraws the account.

This is just overly simplistic and wrong. The holders of the debt that will be paid back will also be in the future generations. They may be one subgroup of the "future generations"; but they are still part of that future generation as dead people don't collect interest payments.
What debt, including deficit spending, allows is for people  and institutions to align the timing of investment and consumption to their needs and opportunities, rather than according to the current allocation of wealth. 
Without debt, a town that needs a new road would have to base the timing of the project on how rapidly it could collect and store taxes. Likewise, the investor would either sit on cash or spend it on less worthwhile projects, instead of buying the government bond.
Let this happen on a national scale and you get an economy that runs very poorly. People can get educations only after they have earned enough to pay for college and have less usage for it. They will own homes only when they are old. And communities and nations will suffer a lower standard of living from delayed spending on physical and non-tangible infrastructure.
True, governments are far from efficient; but running a debt free economy, or even an economy without government debt would steal from both current and future generations.

You also have to live with the same laws of physics that keep your feet firmly planted on a ground, but allow a brick falling from a building to crush your head if you are in the wrong place . 
If you surveyed people, it would be extremely rare to find someone who finds every law on the books fair- in the US or any place.
It is not an option to advocate permitting money laundering to break the laws that some of  us disagree with while blocking it for the truly destructive activities like weapons, fraud, theft, terrorism, more dangerous and addictive drugs, and tax evasion. 
You don't get to pick the good effects and reject the bad side effects...

I have used giftcards on Amazon and sent giftcards to people via email and physically and have found Amazon's gift cards among the easiest to spend, given the large selection and ease of use of the site.
In fact they are so easy to use, frauds have sprung up involving them.

They can exchange the Bitcoins they receive into a liquid currency (e.g. USD) where there is a market for bitcoin and then exchange the liquid currency into KES and transfer it to their local (Kenya) account.  I would suppose they would take some volatility risk and do these exchanges in large blocks to reduce transacation costs.
It would seem easier just to take the dollars into the bank account in the US, send a secure message to  the Tanzanian office instructing them to deposit the appropriate amount of local currency into the destination account. One then does the appropriate conversion transactions in the currency markets and periodically uses international transfers to replenish the Tanzanian office's account. Perhaps not as fund or impressive as using Bitcoin, but what the heck.
I don't do money transfers for a living, but I suspect in all of these cases, the actually money transfer is the easy part. The hard part is protection against fraud, preventing errors, compliance with regulation, dealing with customers, letting people know you exist (marketing), and managing currency risk between the time you agree on an exchange rate and the time you actually trade in the markets.

So how do you deal the complication that someone Egypt is giving up currency and someone in the US is receiving dollars?  In the non-bitcoin case the Egyptians hand their currency to the company that does the wire and your company receives money from that bank. 
There still may delays because the bitcoin exchange may not release the bitcoins until it has guaranteed funds in local currency.
The difference is that the wiring agent is replaced by a bitcoin exchange and that you have some volatility induced by the bitcoin-local currency exchange rates.

It protects against someone pretending to be an authorized user wiring out of your account; it does not protect against someone tricking an authorized user from executing the transaction.
Also protections for business accounts are weaker than for consumer accounts.
@_date: 2015-02-27 11:44:02
A couple of comments on comments. Wells Fargo is unlikely to help because an authorized user made a legitimate wire transfer request---no different then someone withdrawing cash from an ATM and handing it to a fraudster.
He should file complaints against the receiving bank. Part of the reason for the Know Your Customer rule and Anti-Money Laundering act is to get banks to stop being conduits for this sort of fraud. It is disappointing that the receiving bank could not freeze the account immediately.
