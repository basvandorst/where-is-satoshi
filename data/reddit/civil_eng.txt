Wow, flagged for removal even for the mention of BCash... Common guys, this is an honest question that has to do with Bitcoin.

Talk like this is dangerous. It can easily be going down 1k a day too. Don't get complacent.

I'm in the same boat man. Even if bitcoin goes to the moon we can take solace in the fact that we are debt free. There is no shame in taking a profit.

Cool, so it sounds like I was correct in my thinking. Setting up a new ledger your have 4 addresses. Bitcoin Legacy, bitcoin segwit, bash main, and bcash split.

yep, reported

I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but if you don't have the spare cash you probably are not in a position to be making risky investment decisions.

If it sounds too good to be true it is too good to be true.

Pretty slim, bitcoin had no role in the piracy game.

thats cause nobody knows. and if they say they do know, they don't

It's one thing to be forced to cash out because you invested more than you could afford to lose and had a financial emergency come up. I agree with you, those posts are kind of silly. It's an entirely different thing to cash out (most of) your BTC because you've reached your moon, and use it to pay off debt (faster than you had planned) or buy yourself a treat.

Comon man no begging in here.

Holy cow guys. 141 ocmments and nobody picking up that this guy is obviously trolling.... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:55:43
Yes. There will be a significant dip in about 20 minutes. After that there will be no more dips. If you miss that don't bother.
