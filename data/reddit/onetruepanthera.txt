Hit the limit button, put in the amount you want to spend, then put in the limit price (the price of btc you want it to execute the trade at), then then hit max and it will automatically put in the exact amount in btc that the 200 will buy.

Lightning is awesome. Its funny how folks that dont run a full lightning node say its shit. Run a full node and you will never have that outlook.

Oh god what a mistake that would be. Stay away from and forks of btc. They are all shitcoins. Lightning is where its going.

No not at all. The literal meaning of fiat is money by force. You are not forced to use or adopt btc. But you are forced to pay your taxes with dollars.

They are at almost every grocery store now. Thats a coinstar machine.

Interesting. Yeah my ledger is a few years old. I wonder why they took away the legacy chain option?
@_date: 2019-06-08 17:15:42
Open your ledger and you can access the legacy chain or the segwit chain. I first sent mine to a legacy address then switched them over to segwit within the bitcoin app on the nano s. Here is a video explanation. [

As crazy as it sounds, I think McAfee may win his bet.

5 years and it will be slightly different than today. My vote is bank card. Now 50 years and I would say cryptocurrency. This is coming from a miner and I run a lightning full node as well. I would love to say in 5 years it will mostly be crypto but that would be wrong. Adoption is gonna take longer for the average grandma to use.  We are ahead of the pack but dont be delusional.

Not that hard for me. When it hit 20k a coworker said as I walked in "man I cant believe you came in today". I asked why and he says " bitcoin is at 20k. Are you gonna sell"? I  told him he was an idiot if he sold and I was gonna hold. Since then I have doubled my stack.

If you accept btc, I will take one please.

Oh he still is. He only bought a few thousand sats.

Hahaha. This is from a few years ago. Before the 2017 madness. There are many artists that are certainly better. Here is a really good one. [

No because I believe that it will be higher in the future. Why sell it short of where I think it should be?
