I think thats a good solution,
Do you know, when updating from 7.2 I get the follow error when 'git pull' is executed:
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
Also as I understand the mixing initiates at a certain time each day, when is that? and time zone?
Many thanks
I just rebuilt the wallet rather than upgrade, however on the coinjoin page I have registered but it says participants 0 and round -1, TOR is running but backend is not connected
edit: got it working by changing the TOR port to :9150 in the config

such projects should  run on donations and profit through appreciation of the coin itself,
very much like the core development team. I would happily donate, but not to a system that demands fees, it undermines the ethos of bitcoin.
Bobwallets hopefully is going to give a good solution out of this as they seem to not implement fees

We certainly appreciate your work, I'm not sure why the poster above is quite so hostile and I hope my post didn't come across as an attack,
I think with 100 participants wasabi is cheaper than JM, although if such participants is really needed, i'm not sure.
My post was only in hope that you might reconsider the fees, in the long run I believe you will actually make more.
0.05% would be fair in my basic opinion 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:19:45
ICO eugh, smells like some centralized DEX model like the useless WAVES DEX model, does it also rely on 'gateways', 'portals' or whatever you want to call them?
p.s. that is one of the most pathetic attempts at fluffing out a roadmap with zero substance I have ever seen, well done 
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:07:00
I can appreciate that, however the landscape is changing somewhat and I feel you will have to be competitive to survive. bitmixer was a first mover, but Joinmarket, Wasabi wallet and Bob Wallet are all magnitudes cheaper than breeze.

It references the cost of renting the hash power on nice hash, however its theoretical given the whole hashpower on nice hash only accounts for 1% on the BTC network. Unlike many other coins where you can rent 100% of the hashpower needed through nicehash.

grin is not BTC unfortunately, there are a number of coins that provide privacy, however none are as wide spread and commonly used as BTC (which is already hard enough to use in the real world currently.)
Privacy is a great attribute, however adoption is the harder one to obtain and we need 2 of 2 on these points.

Unfortunately BTC is already hard enough to spend IRL, while we do need privacy, we also need adoption. The latter being the most challenging. Therefore it makes sense to approach the more attainable goal to achieve the environment needed in the crypto space as a whole. Which is to make BTC fungible, rather than make XMR accepted on the same scale. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:45:46
yes sir
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:35:20
this is a great reply. I hold a large amount of XMR, but posed some questions to the XMR community that was met with little thought and comments like 'concerned troll'. But this is the correct approach to bring communities together

the zero link implementation that this is built upon was also implemented in a stand alone wallet 'hidden wallet', by nopara73, which would probably be more appealing to you. The idea behind a web wallet, it seems, was to make it more accessible to the masses.
As these solutions only work if many are using them.

Oh I see what you mean, you don't want to use wallets that work with the BIP 70 protocol, I understand that.

@_date: 2018-06-23 15:20:39
I was recently paying for flights and was faced with this from Bitpay, it was such a clusterfuck I closed the site and booked through another. It cost me slightly more but I like ease of use.
It's the merchants and processors that will change, they will change when they see the money moving away

@_date: 2018-06-26 04:00:23
you could make the merchant processor interact with the API on an exchange of your choosing in order to get the Fiat with some control,
However that's still centralized with the exchange,
Unfortunately it'll always be centralized to a degree when dealing with fiat, which is what most merchants are forced to do.

This movement of decentralization is bigger than your lambos and chart analysis, it's a very rare opportunity to take back power that has for so long been held in the hands of few. Bitcoin is a fundamental piece of this jigsaw, but the problem is far greater.

marketcap is an easily gamed metric. 
I can make a coin, with 10m in circulation and trade 1 of these coins for $10 with myself and it have a $100m market cap, or this is the simplified version.
Therefore its acceptable to assume BTC's marketcap will always reduce, while remaining the no.1 coin, since coins are constantly popping up.
That being said, it's a nice surprise to see it rising here

I want to send an exact amount of btc, not a usd amount. What happenens if I overpay an invoice, EFF gets it or bitpay?
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:39:02
I was trying to send a bit to EFF, however to my disappointment they use bitpay, so due to my setup I could not continue.
Could we reach out to them and get them to adopt BTCpay and additionally post a public address

What a shame to see the quite excessive 0.3% fee being implemented, to compare joinmarket fees are averaging around 0.004%
Edit: wasabi wallet has implemented a much better fee system of 0.003% per participant now :)

very good point,
it's like comparing stock in dutsche bank to being as useful as bitcoin

bitcoinsuperstore.us (2% fee) and neverfiat.com (5-7% fee), both are far cheaper services last I checked,
I think bigcoin charge quite an exuberant 7-14%

you're a moron

quite horrendous to know someone would do this,
I guess the guy could have someone turn himself in now and get over the $50k he was looking for through the bounty, what would be the sentences for this crime?

Don't get me wrong, I am very happy to support decentralized, non-profit development (well profit in the sense of an advancing technology will give those involved value), 
I just didn't expect such fees to be ingrained

sure, but I was giving a simple version, many coins within the top 20 have the majority of those coins help by just one person or group, making it easier to manipulate market cap

he had $50k in bitcoin, I think this proves he has some belief in bitcoin,
