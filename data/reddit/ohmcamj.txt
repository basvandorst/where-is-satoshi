A good start would be getting rid of from the sidebar. I couldn't imagine anything more repugnant to average people.

Pragmatism doesn't need a 'school of thought'. It just means you are willing to look at arguments and find what seems most reasonable.

Just wait, it'll be at $10 trillion plus in 5 seconds from now.

Pretty much. There are some libertarians that are fine, and focus on social justice, but most of them are just free market theologians.

Because there are a lot of libertarians who are into bitcoin, and they believe that the government doesn't need to get involved in markets except to enforce property rights blah blah blah

There are a lot of good things about free markets, but just because that is true does not mean one should ignore the problems related to it. Environmental issues, wealth distribution issues, discrimination, workers safety issues, health issues, just to name a few. Free markets do have imperfections that government can help fix. Most libertarians that I have read or talked to seem to believe in a perfect free market, and any issue that might be raised counter to that belief is either a subjective issue(moral issues for example) or only happens because the markets aren't 'free enough'.
I can appreciate someone who believes there are market based solutions for problems related to things like the environment (cap and trade for instance), but for people to believe that things like environmental issues are either non issues or problems caused by government is just nonsense to me. 
The belief that a free market is perfect and has the solution to everything is much more similar to a faith than a well reasoned and informed belief. One should be very skeptical of ideologies that claim to fix to all or most of your problems with a single solution.
