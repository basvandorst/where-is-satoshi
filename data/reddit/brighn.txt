I have multiple bitcoin wallets, all with basically nothing in them. I fell on some hard times so if he somehow manages to get into my bank account through change-tip he's only going to earn like $100 bucks. 
On the other hand, if it's true by some miracle, and I do win, then I'd be able to finally do things I need to do for my wife and kids along with saving some for my kid's college funds. 
When you live in an area that has no jobs, and only a town around 5k so there is no real chance for job creation, it's hard to do something to fix your need for money.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:33:39
In the off chance that this is real, and someone can be this generous I'm going to go ahead and do it. 
My reason is simple, I'm out of work but have an opportunity at a job if I can relocate to their area. Currently, my wife works her ass off to keep us afloat, but with two kids the ship is sinking. Being from rural America, my main skills in technology are completely unneeded and pay for my wife is low despite having a 4 year degree in accounting abs being at the top of her class. If I manage to win, I will for sure use the coins towards my two children's futures, and to help get us back to even on our accounts. 
I also pledge to continue trying to use the fortune given to b me to grow myself and my wife and give back to the bitcoin community and our community that we live in.

Yep, go to sell and it fucking tanks and I can’t do shit
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:49
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:20:05
Lol. Yeah, big difference from living in rural areas.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:17
I did, but I'm also on GDAX. What I mean is that there is a massive build-up of buys, but not a lot of people adding their BCH to the sells.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:32
Or smart when you invested at $400 - $1000
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:57:32
Yeah, especially when the average age in my area is below 20k a year. If it wasn't for my wife, I couldn't have even afforded to buy $20 a month for a few months back then.
I feel like most people on this sub may not have the understanding that not everyone can just hodl forever. I have two kids and a wife at 30. The economy is shit and a good job is $10/hr in my area.
Even making a few thousand in a year makes a huge difference.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:11
Go to any real rural area. Just remember that most of us own at least one shotgun.
By two rural area, pick counties with no town larger than 10k (our largest is like 5k)
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:32:44
How could you not, signing into gdax takes you to the two step section of Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:28
You cannot buy nor sell, but maybe i'm looking at something different than you because it looks like when buys/sells enabled it will most likely shoot up quite a bit then be extremely volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:15:21
I live in a rural area where crime is basically non existent. Murder is nearly a myth and people are more worried about the (disgusting) war on drugs. 
It’s the kinda place where nobody locks their door, always leaves their keys in the car ignition and isn’t concerned with violence.
I mean, I get that all that is a little off, but not being able to say you invested in BTC for fear that you will be murdered seems a little extreme in the other way.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:30:29
You know how crazy that is? Being from a rural area that's around 75% of the average annual wage here. 
That's extremely amazing and giving. Hopefully people like her can bring a new light to crypto by doing good like that. So many people associate it with Silk Road and Tor (I believe the Silk Road provided a valuable service but many disagree).
Good luck!

Not everyone can just hold on forever 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:37:53
It would cost the school money for the electricity, and unless you have admin privileges it wouldn't work. No reason to try as the hashrate would be pathetic
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:09:08
Damn, what kinda places do you people live in?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:51:38
Your neighborhood probably has more people in it than my entire county... Our neighborhood watch is ever elderly person and the fact that everyone knows everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:52:13
I will check this out for sure. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:05:01
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:54:24
Hmm, maybe when you sober up you can explain more in depth the paper wallet. As for being secure, I'm sure coinbase will be fine for me atm. I only have $2 with of btc, but I finally got a job interview next week so maybe I can finally convince my wife to let me start investing.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:51:31
Thanks a lot. I noticed puerile were taking about bitfinex, but when I went on there I really was at a loss. There was a lot going on on the page, but not much explanation.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:29:06
I have doubts you well make it to even 100
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:05:21
Thanks a bunch man. That was super nice 
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:20:09
Every bit counts. I just did my first transfer earlier. Just figuring out the whole thing is nice. Thanks for gifting me. I just really hope people can see this thread and maybe it will help other new guys out too. I downloaded coinbase to my phone and have an account set up now. Everyone seems to think that it's a great starting point. I'm using my tips to transfer there, and I'm going to get a wallet for my phone so I can place find in there too. Obviously at the moment it's more learning, but I'll eventually start buying done and using it a little more.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:39:15
Are you not scared it may drop?
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:34:39
I have like a couple cents in my change tip account. Add me on steam though. Same username.
EDIT: just looked up the conversion. I'm sorry man, I feel bad. $38 might be chump change for some people but some of us are struggling and that would help us feed our kids and ourselves.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:44:05
I personally use a pc and android. Thanks for the info. I updated with the info you posted to help new people out.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:56:38
Good advice. I was planning on maybe putting twenty out so bucks a  week in at first(if I get lucky and snag a job). Until then, I'm just going to stop a couple bucks here and there.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:32:23
I've only been given a few cents. I didn't even know you could donate it with the tag. But hey, that few cents will go towards gas while I'm getting through college. Stuff adds up. With a wife and two kids living off of 28k a year I gotta take what I can until I'm through school.
Also, how do I see how much my bits are with. I can't find a converter on changetip
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:40:22
Damn. Personally, I haven't been able to find work after getting laid off, so I feel you on money loss. My wife's degree got her an okay job at about 28k a year, but with two kids it sucks. Anyways this is all I have bits to give, take it to help cover your loss.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:24:27
I looked at it and thought, what the hell am I suppose to do.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:47:02
I tried to get a few places around to maybe let me help with web design or database management for them, but living in a small town of 5k most of them could care less for any of that. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:14:58
Yeah, I'm looking into bitcoin. I give it most of my reddit attention but being a father of two, that's married and going back to school as a full-time student, I don't have too much spare time. I just applied for a job and I have an interview next week, so I'm hoping to start having more cash available.
P.s. no sane straight man doesn't enjoy peeking in a girls gone wild sub reddit
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:45:40
I lurked for a short time, but finally subscribed. I like the idea of bitcoin. I have had maybe 80 cents worth at one time. I like keeping track of the info, so that maybe one day if I have enough money I can start getting into it some.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:57:52
OThanks a ton, increased my account by 15%. That's a huge amount for me. Married with two kids and lost my job. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:01:24
Yeah, i just unfortunately lost my job a few months ago so my buying power died right when I had saved enough up elsewhere to start buying.  :(
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:17:19
In the US, every time you swipe your card it costs 2-3% of the total for the business. A lot of places are working on pretty small margins, so that 2-3% can really cut into it.
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:12:32
I'm not super upset it's back under 700. Mainly because My wife doesn't let me buy bitcoin often and I only have around .6 coin and I really wanted to get a whole coin. I feel like I'll never reach it now, where as buying $20 a month worth was working well a few months ago.
But I'm glad it's on a rise and gathering more users.
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:20:04
You have to add your address that is on your debit, and it won't take mine. So i lose the ability to use a debit cards.
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:43:33
I can find local people selling? In my town of less than 5k people, with the nearest metropolitan area over 2.5 hours drive away? I never knew.
Sarcasm aside, it's not always easy for people to find local buyers, especially us rural dwellers.
As for coinbase, fuck them. Because I live on a fluke, where my street is considered Ave, Street and neither I cannot properly set up an account to buy from them.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:16:26
Fuck the IRS, fuck their dirty theft. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:29
Can't login though
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:32:46
I always explain it in USD terms. I explain that Bitcoin works much like how USD does electronically.
.25 is a quarter.
.1 a dime
.05 a nickel
.01 a penny
And how the dollar is broken down beyond that like at gas stations where you see $4.598 a gallon.
Then I say the difference is that there isn't set denominations on Bitcoin, so just get what you can or need.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:23:48
Already sold all mine mid crash, bought other cryptos to increase find before I buy back in.
On the positive, I never sold any of my bcash coins either.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:54:32
Damn, and here I was being excited about being .0161 BTC away from making a full coin.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:44:39
Honestly, I discussed this with a customer recently at work. The biggest issue is the volatile nature of bitcoin. I explained that by using it, even if it drops a few cents here or there between being able to cash it, it still would more than likely be lower than the cost of running a card. Also, I mentioned that allowing other forms of payment can open up more avenues for possible revenue from customers, and create a little advertisement when a bitcoiner tells his fellow bitcoiners about the new site accepting bitcoin in the area.
It helps me none if he does it, just thought I would explain other options to him.
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:44:06
Some people are Bitcoin crazies.  It is a fair question that most normal users would understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:09:22
It's not taxes, it's theft. It's complete shit that the government wants to take away something you've gained. 
On the plus side for me, I've always been to poor to worry about that theft bracket. I'm completely enthralled with my measily 1.5ish BTC. I put more in every chance I get and hopefully if I can build it up enough I can maybe work less and actually see my kids before they are out of the house.
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:58:26
Yeah.  I'm unsure how easy it would be to do that. I love in a rural area, and I've never met anyone else that has bitcoin here.  Nearly everyone is unaware of it. Wouldn't know how I could purchase groceries and stuff. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 09:16:39
I'm not new or delusional. Did you read my other comment where I stated I do not believe the party will win.  It's not about winning and losing.  It's about making a statement for what you believe in.  I've been a Libertarian for nearly a decade.  I've never had the belief that the party would magically win an election, getting at least 5% will be a huge bonus.  I think that is possible. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 21:29:53
I'm unsure. Honestly, I'm Libertarian, and I'm excited about the amount of exposure the party is getting. Even with that I understand we will very likely not win the election. I was just thrilled to see the official Johnson website accepting bitcoin.  I never checked the others, but my guess is neither Trump nor Clinton campaigns accept it.
