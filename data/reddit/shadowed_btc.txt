that nomination probably isn't valid, tbh - there's a pretty long list of reasons, but this is a big one:
Are the nominations made public?
The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations, whether publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well as investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.
anyway, aside from that, receiving a nobel prize doesn't stop anybody from doing anything. satoshi wasn't indicted or anything like that, so he's not hiding from criminal charges.

at least you got them from mining, so it's a potential loss than an actual hole in your savings. onwards and upwards!

if there's something you like and want to improve it, sure, do something. if you see huge flaws with it from your initial introduction why would you get involved?

a lot of people assume(incorrectly) that higher costs mean higher quality.

perhaps, but if i were on the committee i'd take one look at that "i'd totally accept the award in satoshi's place" blog post the nominator wrote and reject the nomination instantly.

nothing about the boss' response indicates he wants to be involved though? if somebody wants me to get involved in jumping off a bridge tall enough to break my ankles, my first response won't be "well i should put some cushions down, that could help".

I can't see it working at all with something popular unless the thread is rate limited or something equally horrible, honestly.
