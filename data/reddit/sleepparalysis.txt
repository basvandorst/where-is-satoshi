I wouldn't put so much doubt behind the real backbone of Bitcoin. The anti-state, anti-authority, libertarian anarchist, cypherpunks, cyberpunks and hacktivists.

What options are you using for mining and what miner? 
I don't think there is much of a difference between OS to be honest but I like Linux just so I can SSH in to multiple boxes to manage everything.
I don't have a 6850, but I bet OCing and tweaking the options would get you higher, unless you already have.

I agree with your comment on the privacy reasons behind Bitcoin. This is one of the strongest points of the currency for me. I don't think Bitcoin will be a replacement for gold, silver, or copper physical currencies but rather an electronic addition.
I am heavily biased towards metals and Bitcoin over fiat though. I am at a point where I would rather deal in metals or Bitcoin and have been doing my best to accomplish this in meatspace. Still though, the increase in privacy of transactions as well as anonymity when used in certain ways is huge.
When I introduce someone to the currency I like to let them read the old Cypherpunk Manifesto. Some people don't understand and likely never will but for those it clicks in, they are hooked.

I have 4 x 6990's on 2 Win7 systems as part of my mining op. I can confirm that with them oc'd, you can maybe do light web browsing otherwise they will hang up and the drivers will cause your system to bluescreen.
I use Debian for my other systems but the 6990's do not run well with the Linux drivers in my opinion at all. Huge difference in hashing speeds and half the time I can't even get the system to recognize them. Anyways, you do want to underclock the memory by at least half using MSI Afterburner.
Without changing the voltage you should be able to oc the core to 940 and have it remain stable. This will cause each core to hash over 400 Mhash/s.
You should try to keep the system running under 80 degrees C for most of the day, at peek mine tops out at 90 for maybe an hour and sits at 85 for maybe 4 hours. So 5 hours out of a 24 hour day my systems will be in that real hot red zone. As the night progresses they drop down to below 70.
Mess with the OC settings until you get optimal speed and temperatures, and save it as a profile.

The real kicker will be when he has to admit that when the actual transaction took place (whether real coins or not), the coins had to come from the mt. gox wallet, and thus, he does not have the funds to pay everyone back. Hence the rollback. 
This likely means that Mt. Gox is insolvent. Just depends on whether he can perform the rollback and substitute his personal funds for what was withdrawn during the incident. Either that or he is hoping there won't be a "run on the bank" and he can slowly get the books fixed up.

I am using Debian for my 5850 rigs and without any sort of BIOS modification, I am able to overclock core clocks to 918, and underclock memory to 1,000.

Ya, it is as simple as this example:

2. Wallet stealer copies your wallet to an FTP server
3. Attacker takes the wallet and moves your coins to his own
Keeping it in a TC container will be safer, as most wallet stealers prolly check the default install locations. However, if you've a persistent Malware, then it's possible that it will continually scan partitions for wallet.dat. Once you've mounted the TC volume it would definitely be possible for Malware to copy the wallet.

You don't need government to have a society. Just because government doesn't exist, doesn't mean you can't have institutions and private companies providing these services.
Take for example rural areas in places like Montana. All families living in these areas pool their money together to pave or gravel the road leading into the sticks. It is privately owned by the various unrelated families in the area and they pool together their money for the road.
The same goes for shared wells in these types of areas. The people pool together payments to maintain the well and water.
For space programs that are moving more rapidly than NASA ever did, look at SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, etc.
I don't want to support drug wars, victimless crimes, nation building, none of it. I don't want to support your grandmother, your sister on welfare. I don't care whether they live or die or become millionaires. I don't want to pay for your house to be rebuilt because you live on a flood plain.

No, I believe it is many factors. The value and privacy gained from using it as a currency is great. Much like how in China there are brick and mortar shops who accept digital game currencies for physical goods. I believe that the main driving force behind Bitcoin is the cypherpunk culture. 
Many speculators have no interest in the culture, but they of course play a part in driving up the value. I believe that loss of faith in fiat currencies is a factor. Also that the cost of mining drives up the value.
There are many factors, but this is bigger than simple speculation. This currency can change the world. A world full of surveillance and tyranny.

Exactly, at this point, I don't even think of Bitcoin as, "Will it survive!?" It's just, It's here. It's how I make a good portion of my living. It will always be here from now on, as long as exchanges can exist where I can pool in and out of BTC.
It is a bucket currency with better advantages than straight cash.

Just think, the profit potential is almost back up to what it was a few months ago now. Adjustment, but if you'd like to get rid of your coins PM me and I'll buy them. That is, if you participate in the network at all. I mean, for all I know you could just be some arm-chair schmuck that learned the word "bubble" recently.

The USD profit potential is almost where it was a few months ago when I was making like $200 a day. This really isn't that surprising taking into account that you don't mine that much BTC per day anymore.

You do realize that you can purchase MySpace, Facebook, every dating site in existence, and millions more full databases? Mt. Gox used to sell Magic the Gathering and their front-end displays SQL errors to users.
There is a huge market for this for spammers and phishers. You can potentially make lots of money with the Mt. Gox database if you can crack the hashes. You could also get passwords by exploiting another Bitcoin related website that stores passwords in plain-text and see which users use the same password.
I suggest you start by googling SQLi.

With a single 5850 you are not going to be pulling enough electricity from the wall to do any damage electrical wise. One of my setups I run an 11 amp system on a 15 amp circuit 24/7 for months now.
You can get a kill-a-watt to test how much you're pulling from outlets, and flip the switches in your breaker box to figure out what outlets are on which circuit.
I also have a few dual 5850 rigs that run at about 80 degrees during the day and drop down to 70 at night. These have run 24/7 for over a month. Also, you should be able to get at least 350Mh/s out of that single card.
As your doctor, I am going to have to prescribe a three step program.
1. Drink Captain Morgans and listen to [this song](  
2. Overclock the core clock on that card and underclock the memory  
3. Make monies

True that.

A very decent introductory article in this bleak land of bad journalism. I would not be embarrassed to send someone this link!

Yeah, likely the current system and society needs to crash and burn first. I get you now, I agree. Plus I believe there are too many people who can't or won't practice any form of do-it-yourself mentality.

When it hits somewhere between 90 and 110 it will throttle down anyways to prevent damage. If the card seizes up or the drivers crash or anything like that then it just goes idle and doesn't continue heating up.
You don't have much to worry about imo.
@_date: 2011-05-18 06:47:04
Yeah that's true and probably is a good idea. I would probably tell them to go kick rocks though and get an audit.

People are reporting that you can withdraw more than the daily with multiple attempts. Try it.

When I lived in the country, there were 10 families who paid for all maintenance and yearly paving (after Winter) on the road that ran to everyone's houses.
You bring up a tired old argument. You don't need government to have institutions and society.  Do you think government is magical? Ah yes, you probably do. I feel sorry for you. You were probably brainwashed as a child in the public education system of your country.
*Don't question authority. Pay your taxes, even if they're spent on things you disagree with. You cannot defend yourself, you need police. You cannot choose the food you eat, you might eat the wrong thing. So we will not allow you to purchase the lettuce your neighbor has grown. In fact we will fine him for it. We don't want you to see certain things, we are banning and censoring them nationwide because some information is bad for you. You shouldn't know certain things. Trust the government, say the pledge of allegiance everyday in class and God bless America!*

You're right, it likely won't happen. Bitcoin is here to stay.
A good project would be to code a hash/password cracking system with a web front-end for customers.

Everyone knows that the proper tool to beat a passphrase out of an adversary is simply a rubber hose.

BTCMine is moving to a 2% fee I believe. BTCguild is good when they're up. Tonight a USEast server was put up to cut down on the idle/disconnect issues and I believe one is going up in the Euro-zone.
