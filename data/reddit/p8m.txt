The 22nd amendment, which prohibits a president from serving more than two terms, was passed in 1951. Ask your history teacher about it when you get to middle school.

Bitcoin will never be zero. I am willing to buy any and all bitcoin for $0.0001 each.

 tracks the profitability of BTC vs BCH. The last BCH diff adjustment made BTC ~2.5x more profitable to mine. It will be interesting to see how many miners move back to the BTC chain to take advantage of this.

Definitely do this. If I buy 1btc for $1000 and then later sell it for $1500. I only owe taxes on the gains, $500, because the cost basis is $1000.
Coinbase doesn't necessarily know your cost basis so they just report the amount of each sell.

More buyers than sellers

The taxable event is selling the coins, for cash or for other coins, not receiving cash. 
So even if you sell bitcoin and immediately buy it back you owe taxes on the amount you sold. If you later sell you can use the second price as the cost basis.


No arguments here. Write your representatives.

But couldn't someone replay the transactions from your step 2 on the BCC chain, resulting in you losing your BBC coins?

Even if bitcoin go to 1,000,000 usd you would still lose money with these vs just holding coins. You'll never earn more than .55 with them, assuming the difficulty continues to increase like it has and you pay for power.

At 0.15/KWh they use about $0.27/month in electricity.
They are now 0.09 bitcoin or about 107 USD. At current exchange rates They'll earn about $9 in Dec. 2013, $4 in Jan. 2014. By May 2014 they will earn less than a dollar a month. You will never come close to break-even. After electricity costs you might earn about $8 total before it starts losing money.
Don't trust me though. Run your own numbers.

If you're paying $.15/kWHr and if the difficulty continues to rise at a rate of 62% per month these will no longer cover their power usage by march 2014.
If you ordered one of these and got it Aug. 1, with the above assumptions the max you could earn is about .29 bitcoin before they start costing you money.
