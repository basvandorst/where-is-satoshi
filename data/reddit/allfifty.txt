Coinpot for sure. You can claim Doge, bch, btc, dash, and ltc and then convert it all to btc.

But don't you BCH guys always talk about how you're the real Bitcoin. Didn't the BCH community take hostage a btc sub?
I'm not sure the sign is very confusing with the way the BCH community handles themselves.
But what do I know? I don't hold any shitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:43:30

It looks like someone is trying to utilize cryptocurrency in a real world fashion....and you immediately think scam?

Start with upperclassmen preparing to study finance in college. Talk to math teachers about which students you can recruit, maybe not the ones with highest grades but with the highest interests and ceiling.
Then once you recruit, develop a "staff" for your club, you can open it up to underclassmen and hobbyists.
What activities are you planning on hosting with your club? Or what kind of agenda are you looking to fill weekly?

All of this could bounce back quickly. These are small ups and downs in terms of these coins.
Now if you were down hundreds of dollars on some small alt coins, sure then it's time to panic a bit. But btc, ltc, and eth will all be sure bets.

This is the same tired argument that the world has every time a new technology is released. Credit cards? Never. Internet? Nope. Cell phones. Unnecessary. PayPal? What for?
Crypto is an infant. But we live in a world of instant gratification, where you want the population to drop their panties before you even get their number. This will take a long time and unless you're willing to invest and hold, don't invest.
Patience friend.

Nobody fooled you. You play the game and are currently losing. Maybe you'll recover, maybe you'll stay at a loss...who really knows...but you made the decision to sink your money into something based off the opinions of people on reddit.

I enjoyed sports betting and playing poker. I was getting very curious and researching forex and stocks.
I had first heard about crypto in probably 2011 and never gave it much thought other than it was cool. Finally one day I just bought $50 in BTC and moved it Bittrex and the rest is history.
I'm a holder in many ways, but I do a lot of daily movement on the exchanges...mostly trading down, waiting for upward movement, and trading back to the base whether it is BTC or DOGE.

I wonder if this has ever worked.
Like I know it works with the Indian dude calling from the "IRS" but this seems like a stretch.
And I mean, anyone who knows me knows I'm into weird shit.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:58:07
I always read about these weird restrictions people have on coinbase. I have a $300 limit per card per week on coinbase.
I wonder what the difference is here....
