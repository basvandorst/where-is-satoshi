I completely agree. The pint I was trying to make is that I feel shitty right now because of the mania around. It is for the moment. Same people who invest now and lose will complain later. It is as good as it lasts. This is true for everything

This is misleading. Doesn’t really help the cause of bitcoin.  If you want it to succeed, inform how you can help. Buying and hodling is against the premise of bitcoin

Big difference right. I also remember a directive where cryptos were not deemed to be like exchange as in 1031 property exchange. Hence BTC cash will not be deemed similar to BTC. It should then be a dividend right? I would like to believe it should not be taxed until it is sold. My first comment about it being considered as a dividend shouldn’t be a comment but should be a question.

Sorry No. but considering the way the Cryptos are being treated (like property), bitcoin cash (proportional to the amount you received based on the amount of bitcoin) it should be treated as such. However I am not sure how it should be valued. Should it be valued at the cost of as of 08/13 or 12/31? Should it be declared only after it is changed to FiAT?

The bitcoin cash that you received as part of your bitcoin holding should be treated as dividend even if you didn’t sell it and hodl it now. This has to be noted.

Question here. So coinbase is actually paying $30 to give someone the referral bonus of $10 in bitcoin? Didn’t realize it.

Which ones? Wanted to Buy XRP but couldn’t get verified in Kraken. Not sure how else to buy.  
This isn’t I said so but couple of guys I know bought XRP at .23 based on my suggestion. The only other reason I feel shitty is because I knew about these long time before.  I guess as someone else said it is not just about crypto coins. It is with everything else. I will try to change for sure.

I know man. Remember everyone is talking about this only when it started going up. Last tweet years no one made any noise or didn’t even want to know what bitcoin is
