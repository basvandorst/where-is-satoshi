put your money on a grill, douse it in lighter fluid, and set it aflame. later, regret your decision and try to salvage the burnt money in your pool with a skimmer net

yea circle gives you your own address and you send your bitcoins to there. then you can just cash out instantly to your bank
@_date: 2016-09-02 01:59:46
circle, 300$ weekly limit. afterwards, you need to verify ID to raise the limit
after that go to coinbase or wait the next week to use circle again
