Not anymore. That used to the case when the hash rate was relatively low and the risk of orphaned blocks and double spends was constantly present. These days one confirmation can be considered safe.

You sound like a very open minded individual. I'm glad we have people here who don't fall victim to bias and prejudice.

He clearly said he was threatened with getting charged, *not* convicted. I don't think you have a reading disability, so why are you antagonizing people on purpose?

One thing I hate about bitcoin these days is all the middlemen trying to insert themselves everywhere.

Ok let's see you pay the man then.

That's not the fault of the bitcoin/blockchain technology. Blame all the bears, shorters, leveraged traders and degenerate gamblers over at r/bitcoinmarkets  who have turned Bitcoin into a penny stock casino.

Could you please expand on how this works? Do you use BTC-e + credit card withdrawal?

And where might these places be? I haven't seen a single place that accepts Apple pay in my city, yet I know at least several places I could go to and spend Bitcoin immediately.

I downvoted you because of this. Just because a powerful person with enough guns to be able to commit murder and get away with it says something is immoral and illegal, doesn't make it immoral and illegal.

You do realize that whether their volume is legitimate is questionable?

I agree. There has never been a better time to be alive.
The issue is that we shouldn't just say "Everything is awesome", get complacent and start sitting on our hands. As good as things are, they can always get better.

Your delusional fairy tales are also unsolicited. They don't belong in the block chain.

I don't think there's anything wrong with drawing parallels in order to make a point. It's not really logically fallacious in any way. Godwin's law is just an *observation*, not some magical incantation that you can invoke when you want to automatically win an argument.
The fact that your feelings got hurt by his analogy is a different matter altogether.

2 cents? Really? Either tip properly or don't offend people with your lame penny shavings.

You never actually own your house. You are merely renting your house and land from the government on an annual basis. If you stop paying the rent (property tax), your house is repossessed by its true owner.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:23:45
Maybe because "the space" has proven to be full of scammers, various unsavory characters and outright kooks? I don't blame them for distancing themselves.

Buy a gift card from [Steam Loader]( and top up your Steam wallet with it. I've been using the service for a few months now and it works as advertised. As soon as your payment confirms, they email you your wallet code.

Ok great. So there's a lot of shilling and pumping in this thread, but when it comes down to it, no on really knows how it's all supposed to work. Keep up the great work r/bitcoin.

I largely agree with your sentiment, but please let's not forget the success of DirectX. It is the reason why virtually all modern gaming rigs run Windows and not Linux. I actually wish that OpenGL would progress to the point I can completely switch to Linux, but sadly we're not there yet.

Aren't AirBnb and Booking listed on the page you linked? Or is there something I'm missing? If they accept Adyen, why wouldn't they be accepting bitcoin?

Ask him about the current situation regarding the global supply of physical silver. Amagi has been having shortages recently where items either go out of stock for prolonged periods of time or ship very late. Could it be that contracts for physical cannot be fulfilled at the current spot price? Do you think the price of physical will start diverging from the paper price?

I'd wager this is a case of selective scamming. They know he lives in Ukraine and probably think he has no resources to go after them.

lol where is this from?
EDIT: found it - 
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:58:40
Does this literally mean that I can now use Bitcoin on AirBnb and Booking.com?
Or is it yet another of those "Yes we accept bitcoin, but you see, there's a catch so we actually don't". That whole Braintree thing left a really bad taste in my mouth.
