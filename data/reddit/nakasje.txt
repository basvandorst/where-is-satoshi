I guess when there are only sellers and no buyers, the bubble needs to burst. 
But the Central Banks keep buying and promise to buy as much as possible they can.
In my opinion they do this to save Banks, Pension funds and to keep asset values high. It is in their nature to not accept the slow decrease of value, even they know it wont hold long.
Since there are not many other options left for profitable investment, bonds are the latest station before hyperinflation.
I've seen this happening in the 80's and 90's in developing countries. They were desperatly devaluating en inflating to come out of huge debts.
But nothing is certain. Will the credit rate AAA countries hold it coming next five years, who knows?

As I understand they will use it for [RMA](  departments.
This is a good start-point. After a positive experience, they could implement the blockchain feature into whole supply chain system to register and authorize the serial numbers of items.
Another use case is product testing by multiple bloggers.
When a company sends out multiple products to many testers, at some point nobody knows who has a specific product at a time.
By broadcasting a product via blockchain the tester-bloggers can exchange a product without the mediation of the real owner (company that sends out the product) and the tester-blogger can send a request to test.

Dear Peter,    
I like your presence in media talks. Honestly.  
Things are different now. The tech such as internet and mobile phone brought the world so much wealth now bobo's can afford QE and debts.
Unfortunately many of us still do not understand the value of network-platforms with protocol. 
What is the value of an airplane if it could not fly and carry people, almost nothing. So there you go with your gold.
Gold's network-platform and protocol value is left in non-digital ages and not easy to exchange. 
  
And look to those veterans and nobel price winners. They keep circle-jerking within their old systems and mindset.  
  
You will figure out.

Electronic secure settlement network (or stupidly named blockchain) without third party, including without censor - without permission - without exorbitantly created amounts -, is utilisation of bitcoin protocol.  The one can say the intrinsic value is actually derived from it's protocol, which other money - such as gold - do have it in a much weaker way.

**The failure reasons of ChipKnip**
* Users need to load an amount money on it, which is not possible to use everywhere. And the majority, leave the loaded money untouched for a long time. It has no money saving feature. The money on it will always have less value due to inflation and will give you feeling that you do not circulate your money at higher level as you wish. 
* Visibility of the balance is only possible via ATM's and load points. Many times a payment makes necessary to check the balance first.
* Lost wallet means, lost value (I am not certainly sure about this)
* No eager community with early adapters to educate and motivate each other. It feels like it is imposed by institutions that are part of the oppression and you expected to follow as a sheep their things.
* Not possible to exchange values with other ChipKnip owners.

Start your bitcoin campaign to create the best persuasion of your relations. 
Look around, see for instance what overstock.com is doing.
1. Start paying employees, also other relations, in bitcoins.
2. Start - probably partly - accepting bitcoins. Meanwhile let your buyers know. When your ledger shows you must pay 100 BTC bitcoins this month, you can, instead of buying BTC against some currency, start to accept from your buyers. Which means bitcoins in bitcoins out.
bitcoin flow will exist next to other money flow in your business.
There will be no any interference with currency and banks. You are your own bank. The employers are own bank too.

* It is for technological guys only. And yes, the killer apps are yet to come.

Lets look at Cialdini's 6 principles of persuasion.
* 1. Reciprocity; Bitcoin has none. A government does. 
A government is perceived as giving people roads, water, electricity, education, security and defending of the nation against the angry world outside. This makes perfectly sense if we look and see that bitcoin usage in nationalistic countries are very low. I think, the majority does not get - or not buy - the `world-wide peace` message of bitcoin.
**EDIT** Except for miners. As of 2014 there are practically no room for new small mining investments. Miners are new types of [governments](
* 2. Commitment (and Consistency); Yes, no discussion about it. 
* 3. Social Proof; Yes, numbers are growing. More people talk about it.
* 4. Liking; None. bitcoin does almost not live in idols world. Too little celebrities confirming it in 5 years history.
* 5. Authority; None. Most famous experts talked about bitcoin, were against it.
* 6. Scarcity: Yes, but does not feel like. There are no limited offers of bitcoin. The price go down to go back up again, but that is proof of excess not scarcity.
3,5 No against 2,5 Yes will maybe not loose the game in short term. But it will not win in the long term.

Bitcoin is a platform. You use it or not. It is that simple.
It is pretty much the same as two or more people in a village decide to use own currency.
You could even create your own altcoin, assign value to it and start to trade within your network.
Notice, there is no third party or middleman. Some exchanges claim to have escrow functionality, but I personally don't trust their platform. Only non-hackable part is the bitcoin itself.
Eventually you do not want bitcoin to convert to some other currency. That is kind a killing own your business in favor of other currency. The best way is to implement the Bitcoin from ground-up. When the majority in your country use it, it could your boost your countries economy.

So far the bitcoin has a digital gold function for me.
I keep buying as I can. When I need/want to spend above $300, then I sell some to have $ to do my purchase.
Currently it is not wise to spend my coins, because of the average of my last 6 months buy is around $550.
If I buy at the current price and the price will increase little bit, then I might do some other purchase. Otherwise HODL. Even if it goes below the $1 each BTC. I go with it, forever.

I remember the time I was testing it. I bought for 1 BTC=19 $ 
and saw next day becoming 1 BTC = 3 $.
I never runned away from it, but it hold me back.
Meanwhile, thanks to bitcoin, 
I realize that I do not own $ but borrow them from the banks.
Sometimes I am having paper money in my pocket. The only moment that I own some $.
I own some BTC, there is no authoritair institution like bank or exchange that can hold me back from spending it or cut transaction fees, cut mothly costs  or whatsoever from it.

Well, everyone seems to fail to see the big picture.
**Inflationary period**
When there is scarcity the sellers will demand highest possible price for their goods. For the maximum profit they will test the maximum prices everytime again. Central organisations like governments do what they always do, collect money from public and will use fiat money for it. That is printing money. So the printable money fits in an inflationary period.
**Deflationary period**
When there are many sellers of things and there looks like no scarcity, the sellers need to be competetive with their prices. For the maximum profit they will increase the quality and test the minimum prices evertime again. Dividing the printable money in smaller pieces should do the work, but the Central organisations like governments needs to collect money from public which is not there. Because prices going down, so the tax collections. 
This time the fiat money supportes create money from thin air to feed the governments and other parasits.
Sinds 2005 we see in developed countries a transition to deflationary period.
Economic models did not calculated this. There seems to be no other way than getting poor and lend money, fiat money.
But there is. Look at the mediavel ages. 
There was no fiat money as we know it today, instead there was gold and silver. Sinds people were not much moving around, there was less economic activity and so less scarcity. Money kept gaining in value. Exception is of course the period of declining Roman Empire when they created coins with less gold in it.
We entered the less scarcity period and the central organisations are not able to change their model. 
Will this bring a huge collapse? Not immediately. 
Slowly they will be counted out with their thin air inflationary fiat money. 
Every money is divisible in pieces. The high, and continous increasing, value of the one that cannot be created from thin air will come to awareness of people. 
Gold could be, but it is old money. Just like a horse in an age of electric cars. Gold does not go trough internet wire to transfer. There are much better tools; like bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:05:39
Very well.
Data transfer or handling should be done in smallest possible data size to keep it fluent.
Big chunks of data will eat up more RAM, will have high risk of corruption, will slow down the exchange speed and might not go trough many controlled networks unless they reserve more bandwidth for it.
I think the real innovation should go to direction of smaller size of chunks data. 
On the other hand, anyone claims for bigger block size for the future improvements has no f*cking clue how the computers, network and data works. And yes, there are many developers out there thinking that way.

In the era of digital age a government should not fund any project. That is peoples job. But peoples are smart. When they face common problems then they organize. Today most wealthiest societies are the best organized communities. And every organization need to be managed. The organizations grow and grow and some managers go to the background to become for instance the body of a government.
The stone age didn't end because of no stones anymore, but the new technology made them obsolete. In the digital age the governmental organizations are against the natural order of things. They will not get enough likes, donations or social shares.
Funding public works in digital age will require decentralized organizations. For instance a police office will be only on the places where people want it. That will be the choice of people, not of the government. 
Next politicians are independent entrepreneurs, prepare yourself.

Handling any transaction directly via blockchain (public confirmation network) would be not practical.
The same reasons how the current banking system works.
When someone does a payment with his debit card, the transaction is completed within seconds. That is because of communication shortcut within the banking network. Essentially it comes down to; check if someone has enough money on his account, if so give back a signal it is all ok.
Therefore the next innovation in btc world is a bank-like company that can handle a transaction before the blockchain publicly confirms it. 
I think Bitpay already doing this. As soon as a transaction was broadcasted they check if the bitcoin address has enough budget. 
With this check the payment process done within seconds. They confirm it within their network/database
The real confirmation is done later, it may take up to 45 minutes, by the blockchain.
That is the risk Bitpay takes. Probably they have limit as maximum transaction value for an address. But this is the same with the current fiat money banks.

OK, thanks. Based on your answer I did some research. Here is my understanding.

To keep the generating numbers secure and simple there are 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshi's (bitcoin elements) at maximum. 
Converted to bitcoins is this number 21 million.
One security concern example is recurring (same) numbers in mantissa (51 bits) part. 
Satoshi has apparently made his choice for the biggest number that fits the 64bit floating point number without loss of precision; 2,099,999,997,690,000.

bitcoin does not fit with their middleman AD system.
Baidu with their "premium placement on Baidu search results" looks more lucky, but I doubt it.
With bitcoin there is actually an huge opportunity for search engine advertisers.
Why not "lease a keyword by ask/bid from everybody to everybody on an exchange platform".
Allowing anyone to ask/bid trading on any keyword for some period and reflecting those values to search results would create a new market. Which is more transparent and fair.
But Google holds those keyword, put by you and me into search engine, and sells to advertisers - as if their own property - via Adwords platform.
Well, there might be an organization sue Google for this i future.
For my part we take bitcoin concept and only replace "bitcoin value/money" by "search keyword", create a new blockchain for this and start to compete with other search engines. Just my 2 cents.

Here is my brain fart.
Animals live on a mountain. In order to survive either for food or water they need to walk various paths.
Every time they take a path somebody claim to own that path and charges costs.
Then somebody creates a new path and calls it bitcoin. 
As the time goes by, more animals walk on that path the road hardens and it becomes more clear to the eye and the mind.
Meanwhile the copycats fork, copy or create similar paths. 
Some animals try these new paths. And they soon find out it does not lead to resources they want to exchange with others. Paths are everywhere. Animals spread all over.
What happened?
Complexity increased, animals confused. Labyrinths, that is not how life should be.
They leave those paths and some of them remain on the main path. 
If a path is not fake the natural development should repair the environment and they can start again.
So, what is the point of adding a new path?
I guess experiencing. 
Well, taking LSD in the sixties was a funny experience.
Work at the factory was unbearable boring in the sixties, so becoming brain dead for a while is chill and calm.
But, what happened to bitcoin?
Well, well, well.
That is, 4 years later, still a bumpy road.

My notes based on recent price action.
159 - Market movers are there, especcially when the markets is weakening.
Certain hours, certain targets, acceleration during unusual agenda (periods, events). 
These are the signs of market mover actions. 
They suck fomo money into the market. Moving the price towards their target so their big contra orders will execute. 
Once the target is hit, anticipating their big wall shall not pass, they take contra position.
Simply put;
1 - Accumulate and define a sell target.
2- Once the price is moved up; identify pshylogical level, such as trendline, pass and try to bid exceeding prices to create big price move.
3- identify the fomo via volume and eventually adjust a better reasonable target
4 - wait the target is hit and see your wall is eaten up while the market was already weakening.
5 - place a short/buy position (next to your wall). Here you might want to dump against the weak market or leave your wall order.
So, essentially market moves are the reason why you buy back after you see you sold it for lower.
This "being sucked in" is called bull trap and should be to identified via volume.

More specifically; 
Look at yourself, did you bought more coins lately? No, isn't it!
So, why the price would go up. 
Other money is not that bad, yet, to drive up bitcoin.
With few hundred thousand bitcoin fanatics, inflation and electricity costs of mining the price will go only one direction, down!
It is too premature to look at the moon.

A common practice; When the price just breaks a significant level downwards, lets say 5500, then a big buy order appears and pushes the prices up.  
Suddenly, where did it came from?
Only one or couple of people knows it.   
Moral of the story.
Never trust orderbooks, especially bitfinex. Maybe GDAX little more.
If you still not convinced;   
Orderbook traders R.I.P.

Yes, you are talking about new innovations.

To put in simple
Practical use outperforms the so called intrinsic value.
Paper money did that to gold, Car did that to horse.
And crypto currencies will do that to old money.
Peter talks also about the disappointment after an hype like tulip mania.
Well, that happens in bitcoin every minute or so. In the long run we have seen bitcoin's come back ability. People do not throw it away. Even so it is the understanding process of people that slows down bitcoin. Not that people distrust it entirely. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 18:14:34
Thanks for reminding.
My lesson from 4 years involvement in bitcoin is something like; It is unimaginably difficult to win battle for a new territory of freedom. 99,99% of people are good at being fearful herd animals with learned helplessness. 
From now on people involve in bitcoin not for their libertarian actions, but because of its higher status. And politicians are good at handling the status competitors.

Here is a short analogy:
Peter looks at the Air-plane on the ground and says it has value.
However the real value of the air-plane is that it flies and carries people, it is functional. He ignores this part. 
Numbers that bitcoins uses is compare-able with the air-plane on the ground.
Since people can use these numbers for exchanging values, it is functional.
Herein lies the real value of it.
When I find a better a functional system to achieve my goal, exchange money, 
then I prefer to use that.   
I am not interested in the dead air-plane on the ground or difficult to exchange (dead-money) gold or silver or highly inflated x-dollars, dinars, fiorino d'oro.

Gold is already 5000 years security blah blah.
Horses were also more than 5000 years good transfer vehicles.
Then in industrial age came Cars.
Then in digital age came Crypto-money.
But its in the nature, the conservative old will be replaced by destructive corrections.

* $ savings will earn 0.25% interest while there is low inflation on to it.
  
* B savings will earn 0.0% interest while there is 9% inflation on to it.
* Gold savings .... fill in yourself.
I don't see a sudden massive switch to cause an economy bust in near future.
I only see a decline by slow switch and so repeatedly almost same level rates in next years.
I think the bitcoiner's should count only on slow adaptation. Similar to internet in late 15-20 years.
But nothing is certain in life, maybe the big money will see the light with bitcoin in a shorter period of time.

Think easy.
bitcoin is a precious souvenir that might make you a proud owner at some day.
Otherwise if bitcoin lowers in value, then you will be still proud what you - at least - have tried.

Deep in my heart I am an Anarchist. But it does not work, I know that because of not enough support by others.
People choose for comfort - and comfort zone - by leaving tasks to others and assuming the others leave also tasks to others and so believing in hierarchical society structure.
Either it works or not they see and hear enough horror from the media around them to fear other worlds and assume they are doing the right thing. As long as they are not poor enough.
You see not everybody will be hit by poorness or realization of it. Many can just go die by poorness without ever realizing bitcoin would save their life if they not kept ignoring it.
Still, if bitcoin reaches up to 8-10% world money supply in coming 6 years then that is in my eyes a big success. 
The technology will replace some roles in the hierarchical society, but as always that takes many years. Just consider, even after a big crash the need for change seems not to speed up. It is how it works, it happens very slowly from human perspective. You know the elephant getting older and older and slowing down, but it is still there.
Since the majority refuse to take the control in their hands, we bitcoin fellows - hippies as you wish - will remain the club of couple of millions.
I know I will be able to pay with bitcoin at many places. I shall eventaully move to those places. That is the success I reckon.

Every single business mind should quietly implement BTC the bitcoin. 
In reality many business are already implemented BT C, but for the activation the timing is very important.
Debt and asset bubbles, trade sanctions and wars, bad shape of emerging markets, stagnation in developed countries while the interest rate is lower than ever.
If it feels the shit might hit the fan again, just like many times before.
Then it would feel very stupid that you knew about bitcoin but did not prepared for the future.

He could own another bank specialized in bitcoin/crypto money. Services like savings in digital values, something that comparable with gold.
Now that he owns 2 banks, he can start to benefit of low costs feature of his crypto-bank.
He can start with
* Transferring money over blockchain
* Create the possibility converting fiat to bitcoin for their customers. Especially when people see buying with bitcoin make things more cheap.
* Service wherein the companies can pay remotely working co-workers or freelance workers.
*  Escrow service

Almost every human born into a country is inclined to be proud of his/her it. Reinforced by optimism bias people are blind to the fact they do not own (my country thing) a country but they are just a number in it.

In means of exchange dynamics there is only settlement value. 
An individual might use an abstracted value and consider it as intrinsic; that value is invalid assumption until someone settle for exchange. 
I another words value is not what you attach to it, but what the others give.
People choose to fall in love with a material they own. So the intrinsic value discussion will be repeated many times.

You, and the other upvoters, dont really get his point.
Very top world policy of the US is causing conflicts in and around the countries which they want to regulate in benefit from it.
Many elections, revolts, death of presidents etcetera can be traced back to US.
But the world is waking up slowly. 
The coming crash will make people in US more poor than a developing country.
I am afraid switching to bitcoin by couple of people will not protect a country from the coming big painful change.

Few days ago I've been pointing out the costs of CC to a 28 yo man. It appears he did not know what a Debit card was. He is  just born and grown into credit world. 
Just like him, millions of young people are happy with their first bank account, CC and even being able to lend money. Yeah cool, now a grown man. He is lending huge money and buying house. That the housing market can crash is a low priority question.
