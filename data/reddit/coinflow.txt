Good question.

Think Mooncoin ...

If you use an escrow with good reputation, the risk is considerably lower - not entirely gone, of course. But you have a little risk already by getting up in the morning.

Ok, many thanks for clearing that up.

Only in the corners. Not on the straights.

Not quite true. Germany: 1.000.000 for one million.

What about the copyright of the text you are using?

Err, no.

One should water their mouths by showing the possibilities to them. They could, for example, build on the block-chain, in order to finance something (take bitcoins from one side and invest on the other, being completely transparent, as a "highly approved, strongly regulated instance"). They could be clearing-houses for projects being paid in cryptos - for example bounties for coin-developers, etc.
They could back up exchanges (as market-makers, big-volume-buyers etc.). They could invest into crypto-POS-systems and get tx-fees like with credit cards. They only have to know about that. There are so many options how they could profit from bitcoin and co.

Why do you insult people, only sharing their opinion?

 is a nice option. They work with the Fidor-bank, which is an online-bank (they are planning more:  ).

Maybe one should go to these queues and distribute leaflets there, in order to explain how they can move their money much faster and save the fees with bitcoin? They would have the time to read while waiting ... ;-)

+1  
Would like to pay with Mooncoin then.

I'd rather recommend, to get your information right, before posting such a garbage. Check out the linked thread in his posting and you'll know more.

Because for some transactions it's better to rely on a third party. Why else would you use an exchange instead of simply selling your BTC to anyone on bitcointalk?
