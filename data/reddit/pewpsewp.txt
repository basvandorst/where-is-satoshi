Nice script thanks for sharing.

I disagree. Asking for some transparency from a company who is attempting to occupy a space we are obviously all invested in by making huge promises which haven't been verified by anyone reputable is not an unreasonable request.
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:16:33
Of course.. that is just a good business decision. The question is who would supply the X-50 price consistently and in volume to support a business? Say you did have enough suppliers somehow.. there would no longer be any incentive to mine at all.

I think they totally dropped the ball on the site this year.
Bad design for the 10 mins it worked, a lot of 'hype' leading up to now instead of releasing at least the participating merchants ahead of time, and now their site is down because they just opened it up and obviously didn't prepare to handle all the traffic.
Gravely disappointed.

if logic doesn't work what could you possibly expect anyone here to know what to tell her?
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:50:18
Coinbase or Bitpay
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:57:09
they charge a fee on each transaction. they just received 1.5m from Draper so they are aiming for the long-term adoption profit by taking a loss up-front. 
The real question is why would merchants switch to a 3rd party integrated solution which is going to cost them time and money in logistics to get the sales into their current POS system format? 
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:28:58
This is happening to people who are using a wallet managed by blockchain.info. If you are managing your own private keys and are simply "watching" addresses with blockchain.info then you are safe.

I used this for the first time yesterday and got the 'Amazon Black Friday' price AND 15% off going through purse.io. Very painless process to spend Bitcoin on Amazon.

You guys sold me I bought an apprentice pack.
Great price I'm excited to see the quality.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:42:47
The thing with wishlists is they can be made completely public. I've seen people place them on their blogs for readers to buy them stuff they want ect. I don't think amazon can hold you accountable for a public wishlist anyone could come along and buy for you for whatever reason by any means.
I bought ~$100 worth of stuff through them yesterday I'll post if I run into any problems.

very interesting model. 
is there a minimum amount of bitpieces a creator has to make available for a project? And can they sell them for any amount?

As far as I understand, technically yes.

Right. Many operations now rent/buy out some of their space via mining contracts too
@_date: 2014-11-27 05:26:14
Interesting thought experiment.
What/who would enforce the price of a btc to be at this particular value? If people aren't willing to pay that price to mine a bitcoin who is going to make them?
Mining operations have to think from a business perspective. They can't hold out taking a loss praying to the bitcoin gods for the price to rise. With that being said I think the bitcoin price will need to rise over time for large mining operations to stay profitable at all.

I guess if you don't use java for _anything_ uninstalling is the best option. Most people I know use it for applications and such. 
If you do have it installed the browser plug-in should be disabled by default and only enabled for trusted websites.

I can't find where I read it now, but I'm fairly certain coinbase stores bitcoin in their Vault in offline (paper) wallets. Technically this way if coinbase's system is hacked the bitcoin in your wallet would be safe...not to mention they are insured up to $1mill.
To store your own bitcoin securely, you'll want to look into paper wallets.

Most ATMs I've seen are between 5-10% service charge which is obviously much worse than Circle/Coinbase, so it depends on who is operating the ATM.
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:49:12
It it completely counter-productive to what this community/industry needs right now. We need people to see these deals and at least have some incentive to get into Bitcoin. 
Over hyped and under developed operations like this is terrible for Bitcoin adoption overall.

i believe there is a large random number used in the seed when your key is generated so it is non-deterministic and therefore blockchain can not re-generate it.

It depends on a lot of factors. Their market presence, the industry, clientele, how distinguishable the logos are from one another, ect. 
It is largely a gray area but if you have any doubt and are serious about your startup, hire and/or consult lawyer. It will be worth knowing the risk upfront rather than being surprised with a cease and desist letter later...and if that happens you have easy access for your lawyer to respond, since they are pretty general symbols/logos to me.

I find this interesting. Do you have any customer reviews or testimonies around? Or any way to maybe try it out for 48 hours or something before buying a license?
Also it may be on your site but I didnt see when I glanced at it; what exchanges are used? must the user come with credentials to each exchange they would like to use?
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:34:54
By looking at their site, it seems many of their internal transactions happen off the blockchain to avoid fees. This means they are likely associating amounts with usernames and paying out of one of their internal addresses when someone withdraws funds.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:07:58
I certainly will. Keep your fingers crossed!

You do not release your Bitcoin until the products are delivered. Until you release them they sit in Purse's escrow. If the items do not arrive you file a ticket with Purse and get your escrowed funds back.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:15:35
I agree. I wasn't claiming anyone should put a million dollars into coinbase, I was just making a case from a (hopefully) practical perspective to someone just getting into Bitcoin. And if anyone is that paranoid I wouldn't suggest holding coins anywhere online anyway. 
There has to be some give and take from both sides or do it yourself.

I deposit USD directly into my USD wallet via ACH which takes 4-5 business days to clear as is usual (I have not tried credit card, but it is probably quicker with lower limits) and there is no fee from Coinbase for that deposit. As soon as the USD shows up in Coinbase I log into GDAX and transfer it over (still no fee). I then place a stop order at my desired price and if it's close to the spread gets filled quickly (maker pays no fee on GDAX). So I get the amount of X digital currency that I want at the price I want with no fees. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:54:51
Fwiw if you use GDAX, Coinbase's exchange, you pay much less or no fees at all.

Humans must take a daily happiness quiz of course!
My reply was total joking. I've done a bit of neural network and objective-based AI work and find it fascinating as well. The thought experiments can be quite a rabbit hole though. 
Also thanks for the link I hadn't seen the "maximizer problem" articulated so well elsewhere.
