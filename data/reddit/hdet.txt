Does the game theory really work assuming that the block reward is zero and there are less transactions than the block size? (which seems to be the goal here)
For a miner, it is in their interest to include all transactions with non-zero fees, since it increases profits.
But this means that for a participant it is in their interest to pay only the smallest allowed value as a transaction fee.
So that means that the total amount invested in mining will be equal to smallest allowed transaction fee multiplied by number of transactions.
So it seems to me that the smallest allowed transaction fee will have to be adjusted so that the product is large enough to make 51% attacks sufficiently expensive.

Indeed, a miner could offer such an arrangement and an user could only transmit a transaction to him, or in general to all miners offering a kickback.
However, I think it might be possible to fix this.
That would involve having two transaction fees per transaction, one which is unrestricted and paid to the miner mining the transaction's block, and another one with an enforced minimum value that is paid to whoever mines the Kth block after the transaction.
As long as K is high enough, waiting until a miner is K blocks ahead is infeasible, so anyone will be able to mine the Kth block after any transaction, thus making a kickback scheme impossible.
Effectively this would create an analogue of a "block reward" coming from the second transaction fees of earlier blocks.
Not sure if there is any reason to prefer this scheme to limiting the block size though.

You can have all clients reject any block containing a transaction with a fee less than K for configurable K.
There is no feasibility difference between enforcing maximum block size and minimum transaction fee.
Thinking more about it, economically enforcing maximum block size and minimum transaction fee is exactly the same (for matching values).

Age of consent is often higher (usually 18) if the sexual act is done for money.
