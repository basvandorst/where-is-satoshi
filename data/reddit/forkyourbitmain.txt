As for the “vandalism” claims:
- Bitmain Israel offices are located in an office building that’s open to the public. The guy at the entry welcomed us and showed us the way.
- The protest took place only in the public areas of the building, none of the protesters entered any offices or other restricted areas.
- The posters were put up with [blu-tack]( More expensive than tape, but comes off very easily and leaves no marks. It was important for the participants not to damage anything, just voice the protest.
- We already did similar flyer protests against Israeli banks and corrupted officials in the past. We never had any legal issues. It’s just some flyers, FFS. Lighten up.

This will help Bitmain understand that they're dealing with a strong, united and willing community that's not going to be frightened by their threats and surrender to their demands.

It is an open-access building. There are no identification requirement at the entry, no gate that requires a pass, or anything like that. The guard was doing his job just fine.

We did not vandalize anything. It was a public area within an office building that's open to everyone. We said hi to the guy at the front, and he helped show us the way. We also used that [blue tac]( stuff. More expensive than tape, but comes off very easily and leaves no marks. It was important for us not to damage anything, just voice our protest.

This is protest, yo. Freedom of speech and all. Are you against all protests?

Bitmain are threatening the Bitcoin network with DoS attacks, how voluntary is that?
Would you say that people should not protest against banks, polluting factories and companies that use child labor either?
And [we did not vandalize anything](
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:11:29
Too bad Bitmain ruined the chances of civilly working together by threatening to DoS attack the Bitcoin network and inserting backdoors into their products.

We don't share the floor, but its an open-access building that's freely open to visitors. The guy at the front said hi and helped us find the offices :)
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:32:27
I hope Bitmain will shut down all its offices by later this year!
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:23:19
lol, I was there a couple months ago. hoping that making enough noise about UASF would be enough for it to activate as a MASF. But I've since moved on to fully supporting UASF. :-)

Hi! We had great fun doing that. Would love to hear your thoughts. Happy ATH celebrations from Israel, go UASF!
For these wondering, the protest took place in the public areas of a shared office building that’s freely accessible to the public. None of the protesters entered any offices, Bitmain’s private property, or any other restricted areas. The posters were put up with [blu-tack]( which is easy to remove and leaves no marks.
The Israeli bitcoin community have experience organizing similar protests against Israeli banks and corrupted officials, so it was natural for us to apply that model to Bitmain.
Also, the protest was not about Bitmain's stance on the scaling debate. The protest and flyers were purely about Bitmain's [threats]( to initiate a [51% DoS attack]( against the Bitcoin network and the [remote kill-switch]( backdoor [they introduced]( into their products.

We do that too.

Bitmain are "marked" for threatening the Bitcoin network with DoS attacks and inserting a backdoor into their products. Nothing to do with their personal beliefs.

Israeli activists actually do some kick-ass anti-banks anti-establishment stuff here:

Well, he didn't say anything specific that he didn't like about the protest, just some general comment about "petulant behaviour", which I think you can say about pretty much every protest I ever participated in... protests aren't meant to be polite, they should have some chutzpah.
