Interesting. Who pays out?
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:22:41
How does this work. Can anyone bet or does need to ber yes?
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:02:49
He's right. Tether could very well implode Bitcoin

I like this analogy considering the amount of space and energy it will require to facilitate every transaction and document it. Visa already does 1700 transactions a second, now imagine all the transactions for next 121 years and every single one is recorded on the block chain? I'm curious on how is all this data going to to be stored and managed efficiently.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:12:08
Seems a little more in depth.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:04:59
Please explain why it's not serious then
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:27:39
Hmm yeah thanks I'll look into it. I'm sure curious if there are no losing bets, then will there be no payout to the winners?

Twitter or watching the supply amount
@_date: 2019-11-19 23:10:53
Even worse when you zoom out. Tether is probably responsible for the 2017 run

The equivalent amount of energy it took to mine it

This. Is zeropoint field the same ether Nikola Tesla tapped into?

Yeah like I said, the likelihood of anything happening is slim to none but fincen has guidelines to follow and that falls under msb. Now for one transaction for a small amount, I doubt fincen or irs would put in the effort to take the individual to court. A judge would ultimately decided whether the individual should be a MSB
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:30:08
I've read if you're electricity cost under $0.1 kwh than it is worth looking into mining
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:06:54
You should be 100% certain not pretty sure because it's not. The chances of anything happening is slim but that is definitely considered a msb transaction under fincen guidelines
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:51:31
That is referencing just the definitions of MSB and not sure what year that was from. FINCEN has guidelines for "Virtual currencies" and being a MSB
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:37:33
Be careful. You just admitted to being a MSB and not sure if you are registered federally or at state leve as a msb. Just a fyi.

I'm not sure, do they? Why keep record of transactions on an account from a person who died 10 years ago? Yes I do but you're talking about a lot of data that is decentralized and anyone can see any transaction from the Genesis block to 2100. I'm not a computer wiz but I feel like storing and mangaing all that data efficiently is not an easy task.

She shouldn't be able to send to another person thru the machine, that's actually against some money transmitter laws depending on your state too. That might be your only hope, did she talk the ATM company before?
@_date: 2019-10-29 04:02:01
They're inflating the marke
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:01:40
That's what I was getting at but I got downvoted. Someone doesn't like people knowing about the regulations
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:14:44
This dude is scamming or trying to clean his money
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:01:16
What's your fee
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:03:46
Yep that's where I've done majority of my reading so far. Great starting point. Maybe I'll try emailing someone from there

And the French yellow vest protestors threatening to pull their money from the central banking system. I wonder what they would use to trade with.
