That is definitely the sort of thing I'm looking for. Gonna go buy a few -- thanks!
Based on my primitive philosophy of economics, it seems that something with a real value towards human development  might prove more robust than something that is arbitrary by design. After all, gold was never just itself -- though we discovered technological uses for it later, it once represented expansion and colonialism, which were the technologies of their day. There wasn't enough gold to be mined in Europe, and that is, in a sense, why Europeans valued it so highly.

Sorry, I don't understand how this is a feature of bitcoins. Could you explain a bit? It seems that the early adopters will be the few, and the people who buy them at $100k a coin will be the many.

There really are not so many people in China for whom VPN access is an *existential* matter. Chinese dodge the firewall to look at porn, not CNN.

Whew, thanks. It is scary to ask questions about things whose premises are obscure to you.

China will matter in the fate of BTC because the rich in China need a way to move their money abroad. This is not true in India, for instance. The Chinese government is torn and therefore cryptic -- on the one hand, it want to keep Yuan in the country, but on the other, they love the idea of a global, non-Dollar currency.

That's definitely damning, especially given the current crisis of confidence in peer review of scientific work.
But if scientific peer review, or a designated portion of it, became the exclusive purview of computers (as it is, in fact, rapidly becoming), then it would be much harder to game. 
That is, once a computer has decided that it has made a bitcoin-worthy scientific conclusion, it could send that conclusion out to its peer computers, i.e. other computers participating in the mining process, for verification.
As for producing something of value, I assume that would be the bitcoin itself. If a bitcoin were attached to a demonstrably manageable amount of data analysis, then we could certainly get it to somewhere near 10 minutes. We know how long it will take us to analyze the results of one run of a particle accelerator; if we outsource the work of analysis, we could maybe award stocks in the accelerator's value to science, or bitcoins, or whatever, for each specific portion of that computational work.
Again, I am so far out of my zone of expertise here that I worry I don't make sense, so please correct not only my ideas but my assumptions.

Because they are cheap! Google may have seemed tacky when Yahoo was at its peak, too.

Why would that lead to downvotes? Matter of fact, why is my OP being downvoted? Surely more altcoins competing for a greater real world presence can only be good for bitcoin.

Inhumane, not stupid.

I think I understand this idea, but as I see it, this isn't the most interesting or humane thing about bitcoins. Transfer fees are not, in my limited experience, that disruptive to the global economy. Corruption among countries that were once the victim of imperialism is much more pressing. Bitcoin, or something like it, seems able to circumvent local corruption. There are countries on Earth whose currency fluctuates as rapidly as bitcoin's value does now, and there are, of course, problems with moving that currency, or even more stable currencies, between nations. 
If I lived in China and could not make a secure investment anywhere local, for fear of forfeiture to a corrupt government, I would certainly put some, not all, of my money towards something like bitcoin.
I am just coming into my sincere enthusiasm about this stuff! Once its philosophical and political ramifications hit me, there was no turning back.

If purchasing power is the sole measure of the practical strength of a currency, you'd be better off investing in pounds sterling.

Exactly! Or other, similar problems that we can't imagine yet because not enough people have the incentive to do the computational groundwork.

That's a great answer, thanks! 
It seems ridiculous for people to be evangelists about the only competitor in a novel, unregulated, growing market, but hey!

Every one of them? What would qualify one as being more than that, do you think?

Listen, your point is philosophically valid but completely ignorant of the situation in China. They are not sending people with illegal porn, or bitcoins for that matter, to gulags. The point of the Firewall is not to prohibit heterodox information -- that would obviously be impossible. Instead, the Firewall is meant to restrict such information to wealthy urban elites.
There are two Chinas -- big, poor, rural China and small, rich, urban China. The CCP keeps them apart through a complex system of domestic passports. We may yet see Bitcoin activity in China. Unfortunately, if we do, it will be as a new medium for corrupt dealings among government officials and their collaborators abroad. This is why I am taken aback by your philosophical idealism.

There is, of course, the problem of who decides the hypotheses in whose proof or disproval this currency would represent a sort of stock. But if the assignation of hypotheses was also left up to the computers, then the division of scientific fields, as it stands, could be trivial. There is certainly more science left to do than there is gold in the ground.
