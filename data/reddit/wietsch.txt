Was in the philippines for holidays and saw in cebu a lot of stores accepting bitcoin, great country!

That's exactly the point where bitcoin comes into the game! Banking the unbanked. I don't meet a single philippino without a Smartphone, but it's hard for them to get a Bank Account, so a big fortune for crypto

Blockchain is no wallet i think �� in my opinion you can store your value at a exchange with no worries, when you choose the right exchange...

Which country you are from?

Why you don't use a exchange like binance? Or coinbase? This is Internet, you can use any exchange you want to use, i think?
