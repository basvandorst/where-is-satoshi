Less than 1% for me. 
Most of my money is in a professionally managed retirement plan, the rest of it in physical objects. Though my car and computer experience depreciation, I do have an antique engine that is sufficiently old that its value increases slightly year to year. 
I'm kind of hoping the US housing market implodes in the next few years so I can buy a decent house dirt cheap instead of renting.
Investing in bitcoin for me is just a hobby, an experiment of sorts that lately has not been going well. The old guidance of not gambling what you can't afford to lose is very much a wise move when it comes to bitcoin, I've heard so many stories about people who put their life savings into bitcoin and then got themselves margin called and lost everything. 
If I don't go broke, I might eventually get back what I put in, and will have in the process learned a lot about how the markets work and possibly even had a great time of it. Get rich? Yeah we all thought that once I'm sure, it should be obvious now that it won't happen unless you stumble upon the magic formula to reliably win in the marketplace.

Why would you do that? Don't EVER pay ransomware unless there is data on the machine that you absolutely cannot afford to be without- data which you should be ashamed of yourself for not making backups of if it is so important.
The PC itself can be easily wiped and reloaded, such nerdy magic only takes an afternoon or so to get it back into working order.

To me they are asset, just non-durable asset because they experience depreciation and wear. But both are already close to their scrap value, and will not depreciate much further before hitting that scrap value. 
I did only pay $1000 for that car, and the computer is 10 years old. There's not a whole lot more value to lose with those figures.

Doubt it. I could see the chip being useful in the same way that x86 AES extensions are though, reducing CPU load and power draw for routine encrypted communications. 
These aren't going to be mining ASICs are they?

Too bad for you, I won't fund this unless you make at least a medium as well so that plump women of adult body can wear them too. Its not sexy at all to see little girls running around pretending to be adults.

Bitlicense only affects the seller. Legally, businesses cannot offer bitcoin-related services to clients in New York State unless they have obtained a BitLicense. 
I highly recommend civil disobedience. The entire notion of a bitlicense is contrary to the core concepts of bitcoin, and letting the governments regulate bitcoin in this way is just going to let them feel entitled to do other things to it as well.

I hate New York so much. The Empire State is no more, just a rotting husk as all the businesses have left for either Texas or Overseas depending on what kind of resources they need. 
This is just one more thing, one more reason, why NY needs a new government.

$10 a week would be plenty. When the price is on a low trend, buy it. When its moved up higher, save the cash instead for when it comes down.
Also, take the time to learn about market analysis and trading techniques. That $10 a week can not only accumulate as savings, but if you learn how to trade efficiently can build up additional income trading bitcoin as if it were a forex market. Not only would you be earning additional income using your savings, but you'd be helping to reduce the volatility that hinders bitcoin acceptance.

Is it just me or is blockchain.info not using the up to date wallet.
This is probably due to the BP66 validation starting to be enforced, pools using old wallet versions while mining will create invalid blocks that other wallets will reject.

Actually it might have been wolong pumping it this time. The sharp rises, the 100% shakeouts. 
That chart looked suspiciously similar to Dogecoin's rise to 300 sat, just at a slower timeframe since it is much larger and heavier than doge was at the time.

They make it stop every so often. The FED shovels money at it to get it going again. The printer giveth and the printer taketh away. 
And printer ink is currently the most valuable fluid on the planet.
