You know who you remind me of?  The dean in Animal House, and Doge is Bluto.  Or maybe Otter.  Or both.

Something needs demand in order for hording to mean anything.  Bitcoin has no inherent value.  Its value is based purely on its demand.  Betamax was a superior format, but VHS eventually won.  Superiority doesn't mean shit if you don't gain acceptance of the plebes

The government gives away money all the time through t-bills, yet the dollar still has value.  Ultimately, value of a fiat currency is given by the people(through the government or not).  And right now Doge has a value and people are going to use it.  Bitcoin's biggest problem is that people are hording it hoping that it is an investment, rather than using it so that it gains greater acceptance and exposure.

Bluto became a Senator.

Err, Jobs is the reason they are what they are now.  Woz was the pioneer in this regard, and he was shown the door unceremoniously because his vision doesn't jive with shareholders

Still has zero inherent value, and therein lies the problem.  No government backing, no currency to peg it to, no real commodity to back it.  It's kind of like having a hat in Team Fortress 2.  Someone might buy it for 5 bucks, but it's only worth 5 bucks if you sell it, and then it might be worth nothing because no one wants it anymore, and once the game shuts down it's worth zilch regardless.  
As a virtual currency, the only one worth any real value is EVE ISK, as it has an exchange value set for USD and EUR.

Okay, I'll bite, how does changing the currency fix this?  People with money are going to take risk in investments more when the currency is more volatile and when it's less clear how the courts will will side in contract disputes?

Like what?  Getting a business loan is trivially easy today

There's not one person or entity making that decision today.  The only consistency (for secured loans) is rates.  
That said, again, how does that improve your chances of receiving an investment?  You've more decentralized the process, but what does that gain you?  Does that make the risk any less?  The market is pretty loose with money with low rates as it is, but lenders do more due diligence today(both by law and because they don't want to collapse).  Is the gain from less regulation?

Gold has millennia of history behind it as a currency and a store of value

America is a governed land with moderated freedom built into the by-laws, not a land without governance.  Anarchy tends to turn into dictatorship or oligarchy really goddamned fast, so it's hardly "free"
