Brickstring just does not get enough coverage in the media. At last some recognition for Brickstring and the crucial part it plays in the foundation of everything.

I can follow your thinking in Satoshis, but what I miss, is then a 1.000 separator.
On my Samourai Wallet, I have now 0.1379 BTC.
That is easy to read, and easy, if necessary, in my mind, to convert to Thai Baht, Euro, or US$.
But when I change to Satoshis view, I have 13790000 sat.
With a first fast look, I have no idea of the value, I have to count the digits.
It is much easier if it was written like 13.790.000, using 1000 separators
Then I can directly see I have 13 million 790 thousands sat

That I don't claim to know. I'm not a TA guy a chart guy or anything like that. I'm a HODLER and a noob but I DYOR like a jedi. I listen to smarter people than me who are actually in the industry.
All that being said, from what I have seen and read and heard if you are using BTC - amount you may well need at least 2 full BTC.
Folks like Tim Drapier and Tom Lee and others see this at well over 250k by 2022.
My only suggestion is to BUY BUY BUY- what you can while you can.
Institutions have been gobbling this up while it's cheap. Don't listen to Jamie at JP Morgan or those fools. They are and have been quietly behind the scenes buying BTC and setting up trading desks and other services to flood the market once things are a go.
Again not financial advice always DYOR but after doing mine... knowing what I know... STACK and HODL - and you will be fine!

Flawless, I also believe the satoshi is better suited for everyday use than a whole BTC.
However, don't forget that using billion as "a thousand million" (10^9) is not global. A billion in Europe is "a million million" (10^12).
It's usually not an issue becase most units are big enough that billions are not that common, but in the case of Satoshi... it will be common unless BTC price skyrockets...

It depends how much money you've got. If you went all in bitcoin early and now have $10m worth of BTC then you can rent for life with ease. Only people who don't have much money are slaves to landlord because rent is high. If you buy bread for a baker, are you a slave to the bakery? No because bread is cheap compared to how much you have. So how do you get so much that rent and bread becomes cheap? You buy high growth assets. Most people judge real estate based on past performance. Apply the same principle to bitcoin and we have an asset that can make you very rich due to high growth rate thereby making you a slave to no one.
Let's say you have a modest $1m in BTC. Let's say it goes up 10% per year (conservative as in the last year it's gone up 60%) then that is already $100k per year you're making. It's more than enough for rent, bread, and anything else.
