not underused at all, and i just stated how they're expensive. if i ever seem them close to the average market price the user will have a hefty USD minimum like 400-500

ayee! this is damn near what i'm looking for, i think i'll start using this. How has your experience been? Are there more times where you receive it instantly or within 24 hours like it says? Not that it matters really, just wondering. i haven't stumbled upon this one yet and it looks like it's for me! to jonstern it's only a 5.7% fee which i can deal with

damn right

one thing i'm wondering though, is why do they want your bank acc # even if you're not getting the card drained with the ACH transfer? seems odd

yes i'm a member here, and i was very close to an instant purchase, did all the verification stuff which i have no problem with, except you now have to verify with credit card ONLY for emergency purposes. they don't even support debit cards. i don't own a credit card, and i never will

we do but like i said, the fact that they lock in the BTC amount when i make an order is totally unappealing since a bank transfer will take 4 days and the market value can go down leaving me with a potentially big percentage completely gone. they aren't like other markets where the USD transfer gets loaded into your account and THEN you trade it, giving you the correct amount of coins at the time you purchase them

yes, at the time you click "sale" which means in the 4 days it takes for the money to transfer the coins could be worth much less than what they were when you clicked "sale"
