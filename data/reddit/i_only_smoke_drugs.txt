Cash out enough to live and invest the rest in mining monero. By the end of the year if crypto stays strong you will have ROI plus profits and be able to keep mining or sell the equipment. This is what I would do. Go to their website and calculate the energy costs and it will show you what you will make at the current price. Even if the price drops you will still be earning currency and won’t have to worry about price as much as if you just threw your money on an exchange. You could take some of your earnings and invest in other coins
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:12:08
Yeah ok.

Are you mining with a microwave?

Look son. You can continue on this path of being a useless waste of space or you can get off your ass and do something that adds value to the world. If you continue on the path you are on no one will remember your name.

Well golly gee ghee99 you are making me blush. I really hope you take a second look at cryptocurrency. I honestly wish it hadn’t gone so mainstream before it was ready. Now all the new people are butt hurt because they jumped on at the worst time possible. Maybe it’s because I’ve been in this space so long that I’m brainwashed by crypto but I really believe in the change it can make. Remember the rules of crypto and you will be fine
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:21:58
You’re also on the internet so things may not appear as they actually are. I’ll smoke all the lsd that I want to thank you very much. I’m just waiting for you to realize that I’m not even reading 95% of what you type 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:23:39
When I see something I think is incredibly stupid on here I always take a look at that users post history. Usually you will find out what’s going on. I’ve noticed that a lot of gamers are posting and commenting negative stuff about crypto. This guy mainly posts in the_donald
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:33:51
That’s actually not true. If someone did nothing but tell you their stupid and useless opinion all day would you feel good and healthy? All opinions aren’t equal.

The only reason google has your information is because you give it to them.

I’ve done pretty well smoking marijuana. I remember going to tests high af and getting As. Graduated in December with a 3.7 gpa while high af. The only reason that I quit is so that I can surely pass this upcoming drug test in April. What are you going on about with this march? I’ve been shooting guns since I was six. My family owns hundreds of them.

The thing is you never know if one day those beanie babies will be worth a fortune. Probably not but no one can say for sure. In 10 years there could be a surge in beanie babies and people will want to have the originals which will demand a premium price.

So how is this a threat to blockchain
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:05:51
Yeah if you have an extremely limited knowledge of what the internet is I wouldn’t be surprised if you believe all of this. What do you think the internet is? Do you actually think google is the only way to do anything you said? And what do you mean ‘normal’ life? A life according to what you think is ‘normal’? So much ignorance in this comment.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:53:47
BTC and the others. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:48:24
How does that mean they can crack it though? Where is the evidence?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:15:15
Are you saying to sell you my bitcoin now and buy it back later at a higher price? I don’t understand 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:09:59
So what you are saying is buy low and sell high. You sir must be a genius. Please write a book so we can read it and begin to understand your mastery of the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:59:53
Shit I remember seeing it at 17k and just selling immediately. I haven’t sold a bitcoin since
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:23:11
Dude send me some bitcoin and it will be all better for you
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:51:23

But what if that cat lady was right?

And it’s still up over 700% this year. Is there anything that it can’t do
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:05:38
I would do the same thing.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:59:52
So dump the kid and wife for more bitcoin? It sounds a bit radical but I like it
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:16:46

That would assume that no technological advances happen with processing power and how energy is delivered. The mining of the last bitcoin is something you won’t live to see unless we somehow figure out how to extend someone’s life for around 100 years

Yeah ok smoke another one man

You must be an expert

Yes but do you really understand inflation and the value of what you are being paid in? I think we are talking on 2 different levels. Yes I get paid in fiat as well but I see less value in fiat than I do blockchain. Therefore, I exchange my fiat currency for something that has a higher value in my opinion. Blockchain isn’t going anywhere. Governments will use it but they aren’t going to tell you that until they are fully invested.

I scrolled through it but I have a hard time focusing when reading something that long. I always have to read a paragraph twice because I can’t focus and often don’t end up reading at all. It’s odd because I read a lot in my teens. Sometimes I would read for 8 hours straight and now it’s hard to read 8 sentences

Lol you’re an idiot but you’re one of my most favorite idiots. I’m beginning to like you ghee99. I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. Maybe I was too aggressive in the beginning. I promise to be more gentle in the future if you could only forgive me. You’ve clearly presented facts that everyone that has ever done drugs is now sitting on their moms couch taking fat rips out of a bong. It didn’t seem that way in college but with the evidence you just presented I have no choice but to realize that I was in a marijuana induced coma and I never left that couch. Even now, as I type, I’m still on that couch dreaming.

Why? Do you honestly think that bitcoin is about to crash below what it’s at right now? Holy shit go to the chart and zoom out bro. I hope you didn’t sell so you can buy it at a higher price in a couple days
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:22:42

This has nothing to do with religion at all. As far as I know Jesus loves bitcoin and she bought ten of them at 30 cents a piece.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:04:33
Only if you bought bitcoin at a price above its current value. For me cash isn’t worthless but I can see how it could be sooner than we expect. I’d rather just keep my bitcoin and not deal with banks at all.

I like some documentaries but I can watch those online. Tv ads no value to my life. At all
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:33:02
I never said it did. There are many blockchain technologies out there that seem like sound investments. The US treasury is not one of them. To me. For example, according to Coinbase the value of 1 bitcoin has gone up 732% in one year. How much has the USD gone up? Or has it gone down? My guess would be down
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:05:28

I’m pretty sure the hodlers have been in this far longer than you. Can’t say for sure because I don’t know you personally. I actually believe in what bitcoin can do. Not as something that will make me rich but as something that will change the way the world handles finance. Also not just bitcoin but blockchain technology in general. There is no going back to fiat from here for me. For me it is blockchain not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:07:06
Who says it is going below it’s current price? You? Oh please tell me what to do with my bitcoin since you are now the wizard of crypto finance.

Unless you are a day trader I see no reason to keep coins on an exchange. It takes minutes to set up a wallet and keep the coins in your possession. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:20:45
Just pay the couple bucks to put them in your wallet. The only reason to keep coins on an exchange is if you are a day trader.

Swapping some for Monero and holdling most. Bitcoin is going to the moon or I will eat my phone.
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:25:58
The price of purchasing Bitcoin varies between different exchanges. The method that you pay with also effects the price due to bank fees and tax on remaining anonymous. There is an app called Bitcoin ticker that will show you this. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:13:56
Please don't keep your coin on an exchange. It's so easy to set up a wallet and keep your coin in the hands of someone you trust. Yourself.
