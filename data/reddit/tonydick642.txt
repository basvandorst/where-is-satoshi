Not a troll, just trying to find ways to communicate adoption to real people.
I think that the merchant does want it to be easy for themselves, but even more than that they want their customers to be happy too.
 
I know there is some kind of controversy between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  I really have not dove into why some like one and not the other.  To me it just seems like those two are the best candidates for mass adoption.

Thank you,  this is helpful. I had no idea they have been using misleading practices.  I may have been influenced by some of that. It's hard to learn everything from scratch

This is not productive, nor does it help anyone.

Please understand there are people who know little-nothing about the difference between BTC and BCH.  I fall in the "very little" camp, but poking fun at that will not be helpful to anyone.

Although I agree with this, what is an alternate path to mass adoption?  How are we going to get the majority of consumers to change to Bitcoin without providing some kind of migration tool like coinbase/bitpay?

This is a great post.  I've never heard this perspective.  Thank you
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:11:51
This is practical, and makes sense.  Thank you

Look at the 7 day chart, it's so sporadic,  not organic

Yep, old info
