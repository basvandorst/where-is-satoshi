Another thing they need to make clear about the backup of wallet.dat into DropBox.. you are potentially moving your wallet.dat into a very insecure environment if you don't have a good password policy on your DropBox.

More info on mine. Outside of using blockchain.info i was using Armory and it was an encrypted wallet, so my assumption was the their got access to my blockchain.info account.

My wallet was an encrypted Armory wallet.

No idea which it came out of. I had temporarily disabled f2a due to the blockchain.info windows phone (unofficial) not supporting it.

Nope disabled it so i could use the Windows Phone Blockchain app. Ha silly me.. You have to laugh or i would cry lol

Excellent thank you. Answer is to stop using blockchain to monitor Bitcoins and just use Armory.

The thing about those though, is even if they did get the backup.. it was still a passworded wallet.
It must have been 2 ,3 or 4 but looking at the two machine i only ever accessed my wallet from (got no authorization email asking for a new machine to gain access) I can't find any security breaches.
I'd just love to know how, but alas it may be a mystery.

It's worth also noting that the address seems to have regular income and seems to be clearing out wallets, further backing up the malware theory.
I am gonig to create an unecrypted wallet on the PC that had the wallet.dat on. I will put a small amount in it and see if it gets transferred out.
Then I will know this PC is infected and I will create an image of the OS to investigate further.

As someone who has today had money stolen from a "hot" wallet. Be paranoid very very paranoid.
