How confident are you in that assessment? I suspect you are probably right, but I'm aware of no actual quantification of the efficiency if the current system. And it seems like it would vary substantially based on the size and type of transaction, storage, etc. we are talking about. Further, we know improvements can be made, so I'm not sure it makes sense to compare crytocurrency in its infancy to a highly mature fiat system. 
One potential reason it could be good to use a lot of energy is "because you have to". It takes a lot of energy to build and operate a children's hospital. All else equal, certainly we would prefer a children's hospital that uses less energy, but we don't call the hospital bad just because it uses energy. Now, I'm not qualified to answer the question of how much energy "is needed" to make Bitcoin work, but it does seem like energy requirements are one mechanism that helps keep the blockchain decentralized. There are certainly path dependencies and I'm confident it would be foolish to suggest that improvements can't be made, but high energy consumption could be one mechanism that helps keep a blockchain decentralized.

I think that's a pretty terrible summary of the argument in that article. I'm not sure I buy the renewables part of the argument, but the more important point made in the article (and ignored by nearly everyone) is the "compared to what" problem the author points out. 
Yes, it takes energy to make Bitcoin work. The same is true of every other currency in the world. A true comparative analysis should properly account for the latter.

I don't know that I'm confident it will get here, but I'm curious, if you do believe so, do you expect that could happen without price appreciation?

But seizing other people's assets is... While freezing an account may not be a permanent seizure, it is a temporary seizure and still a violation of one's property rights. 
I don't know the details of the terms of service that people establish with eBay, so I will accept that there is some potential wiggle room here. If people previously agreed that proceeds from bitcoin mining equipment sales would be subject to temporary seizure, then it was their fault for breaking this agreement. However, I highly doubt that there is anything in their terms about the sale of computer hardware or hardware that they fear could be used by competing companies. If this wasn't clearly stipulated in their terms of service, this is absolutely a form of temporal theft.

If a contract is illegal it is not enforceable. 
Landlords will put BS in their agreements all the time. They also usually put in a clause that if a section is found to be in violation of the law, the rest of the contract still stands. It's a good way to convince an unknowing tenant that they "agreed" to something and it must be enforced, even if it would be thrown out by the court.
Also, contrary to your point about just siding with business, the drafting party of a contract is ruled against in cases of ambiguity. Because big companies often draft their own agreements, this means the court will rule against them in instances of ambiguity (though I'm assuming a "fair" trial here and we know that isn't always the case).

Well as Bitcoin exists now, you have little to no legal protection. Therefore, caveat emptor is the appropriate approach for anyone engaged in Bitcoin. That doesn't mean it is *right* for others to defraud (it certainly isn't as that is an act of aggression), but until the system is further developed, it will continue to be difficult to achieve recourse against an aggressor.
I would also say the libertarians aren't opposed to regulation, they're opposed to centralized/corruptible regulation. You misunderstand the libertarian argument if you think they are advocating a world without rules or justice.

I'll admit this is not something that I think would be good to happen overnight. I think that seastedding or the growing of a grassroots community (perhaps somewhere like Central America) would be best to allow people to opt into a system like this and see what works or doesn't work. If we want to talk realistic scenarios for the US, I would much rather see a form of Milton Friedman style negative income tax implemented, with across the board elimination of all other existing welfare programs. This would ensure a minimum level of income for everybody, while not hampering incentives as much and making it much more efficient to implement. But, back to fantasy land...
You are correct that I am advocating a system of restitution rather than retribution. I personally don't believe "society" is ever the victim of the crime, it is only the parties who can show direct damages. When it comes to discouraging crime, most murders are highly emotional activities and the penalties of incarceration don't do a lot to deter this activity. I don't know that the restitution is going to do much to deter that activity either, but it at least provides compensation to the victims family (or a source for revenue to seek justice for the victim). If private property were truly private property, any land owner would have absolute veto power over who can be on their property. In the extreme, you could envision an individual becoming a "prisoner" on their own property, due to the fact that nobody will allow them on theirs. My guess (and I don't know what people would come up with) is that so type of voluntary prison would actually form. If I am convicted of a crime, but want to earn back the trust of society, I can subject myself to some type of monitored rehabilitation program. In the same spirit as your previous comment regarding retributive justice vs. true rehabilitation, these types of systems would do far more to encourage better behavior and provide some type of institutional approval so that somebody could begin re-entering society. Also unlike our current system, if somebody becomes dissatisfied with the quality of service they are getting at one institution, they can simply go to another one or return home (though they may be somewhat confined at home). 


I do think that this would likely be a somewhat realistic level of penalty for a crime such as murder or attempted murder. You are right though that most people won't be able to pay this. Insurance helps solve some of this (many people theorize that insurance would not only cover the victim in the event of a crime, but also cover the party committing the crime). Like uninsured driver insurance, individuals could also purchase some type of coverage to compensate them in the event that their aggressor is not covered. Let's take the hardest position to justify though, what happens if an individual has a $1,000,000 fine levied against them, but they have no money. Under our current system, there is still no benefit to the victim. Medical bills may be covered by insurance, disability insurance may cover loss of income, but nobody can protect themselves further than that. This scenario would be the exact same, except they would be entitled to some compensation from the criminal. Something interesting happens here though, their ability to get compensation from the criminal is based on the criminals ability to generate income. Both parties have an incentive to reach an agreement that provides as much compensation to the victim, while still being sustainable for the criminal. The victim even has a new incentive to potentially invest in the criminal's ability to generate income. That could be sending them to a rehabilitation program, investing in education, or any other investment that could increase the criminal's earning potential. Maybe it is the idealist in me, but there is just something much more beautiful to me about having people work together rather than work against each other. Now maybe this murderer was a psychopath type beyond any cure. The victim may not ever get any compensation, but that is still no different than today's system.


You are right that you would still be entitled to the $10,000 (or whatever the penalty is). I was assuming they *only* had a gun and not any type of protection service. Therefore they would need to use some type of contingent agreement which would cut into the proceeds they would receive. Actions definitely still warrant punishment, even if an individual acts in self-defense.


I would say they would be held accountable by the legal system. I'm not advocating for any type of removal of laws. I'm just advocating for free-market law. It is finding the distinction between government and governance. Governance would still exist, but it wouldn't be controlled by a monopoly institution. I would say entrepreneurs have this power by providing better services that run unscrupulous businesses out of business. An opportunistic attorney could also jump at an opportunity for a lawsuit when a company did not honor their contract to their customers or in any other way harmed them.
You are correct people sue the government and win. I should not have made that an absolute statement. Our power to hold the government accountable is limited, but not nonexistent. Take police brutality as an example. There are instances when police are held accountable, but there are also many instances when police get off easy. When you have a system of law constantly competing for customers in the marketplace, there is a much greater chance that people would be treated fairly and things would not become lopsided. It is the regulation of competition, rather than the regulation of government.


This goes back to the whole restitution issue, but my guess in this instance is that she would immediately have the ability to sue for some serious restitution. Even if a case has never been tried before (i.e. it is some new type of crime) common law can still handle new cases. There aren't prior cases to reflect upon, but the judge/jury/mediator can determine what an appropriate sentence is for the crime committed.

Can you give me a specific criticism of what I'm saying?
I'm just pointing out the standard "[myth of the greater good]( that persists to justify all sorts of restrictions on civil liberties. Historically people have successfully argued that homosexuality is detrimental to the "greater good" therefore it must be prohibited; that segregation is better for the "greater good" and therefore it must be allowed; that the collection of every US citizens communications is essential for the "greater good" and therefore it is justified; and I could go on and on...
The purpose of law is not to provide the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people. Rather, it exists to protect *individual's* liberties. True liberty is the ability to live your life how you desire, so long as you aren't causing harm to others. True liberty is the ability to marry whoever you want, even if other's disagree. True liberty is the ability to start a website and choose for oneself which products will be allowed to be sold through that platform. True liberty is the ability to use any type of currency that an individual feels is best for them.

Now, maybe Bitcoin never becomes a widely used global currency, that is entirely possible, but I don't see how it could become widely used without a very big run up in value (note: I'm not saying I believe it *will* run up in value, I'm just saying that if it becomes what people suggest it could, it will need to).

I think this is a good point and others have made similar comments. I was very interested in HTML and made some decent websites in elementary school, but I also happened to be athletic and organized sports came to dominate my childhood. I went the non-technical route in college (finance). I started and eventually sold a small business while I was in school. During that time I had an itch to code again and I enjoyed putting together my own inventory and accounting systems using VBA. However, as before, it remained a temporary interest and not something I really devoted myself to. 
If I'm honest with myself, my itch to learn code again would probably stall. Even if it didn't, I would never catch up to the young people devoting all their free time to it or the professionals writing code every day.
Now I find myself in corporate America with a CFP, a master's degree in financial planning, and (hopefully) wrapping up my PhD soon. There are a lot if regulations in finance that can make side business projects difficult, but it's not impossible. Given the skills and experience I do have, it probably makes more sense for me to focus my efforts on ways I can get involved from a non-coding standpoint.

Self regulation will never work when businesses can't be held accountable for their actions. "Self regulation" in either the US or the UK is a misnomer, because regulatory capture has allowed financial service companies to get away with what would otherwise be fraud.
Let me give you an example from the US. Intentionally deceiving someone about a product is fraud. In a free market which protects property rights, fraud is *always* a crime. Every single day people in the US are victims of purchasing over priced investment products that they don't understand. Advisors will intentionally use deception to sell these products. In the absence of regulation, this  deception would be a crime. But what happens in the US? It turns out that the financial services industry got their cronies to write legislation that says that disclosure of fees must be provided. This sounds like a win, because now people must be informed before purchasing a product, but the reality is that according to that legislation, "disclosure" can be buried in hundreds of pages of documents. There is now no responsibility of an advisor to actually disclose anything in a way that someone understands. To make matters worse, if an individual wants to sue an advisor for intentionally deceiving them, they won't have any recourse. The advisor will simply prove that the legally required disclosure was given and they will be off the hook. This is how you legalize fraud.
Tl;dr there has never been such thing as an unregulated market. Financial companies have used regulatory capture to legalize fraud. The ability to hold another party accountable for their actions is essential to a truly free market.

I didn't say it was probable or realistic, but that doesn't make it theoretically impossible. It also doesn't mean it's a weakness of bitcoin relative to other currencies, but if someone wants to know all possible risks, it's probably worth throwing out the extremely unlikely ones as well.

No, it was a statement that many business models could be disrupted by crypto-currency technology. Bitcoin has the potential to decentralize financial institutions in the way that the internet decentralized media. Those who currently have successful financial businesses (or governments that operate based on fiat), definitely have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. I was just stating that these institutions (as many already have) will resort to the same type of "greater good" arguments against bitcoin.


There most definitely is a difference between the two. I will admit that I *personally* believe that the greatest good is achieved when individual's rights are respected, but the list of examples I gave are all examples of *other people* who think the benefits of violating an individual's rights are worth the costs. Just listen to pretty much any politician talk about the Patriot Act...it's a "trade-off" between civil liberties and safety. *They absolutely believe that violating an individual's rights is better for the greater good.* How can you deny that?


I read this 3 times and I just can't quite tell what you are saying. Can you rephrase this?


No. This is *your* error. Businesses are owned by individuals who don't lose their rights when participating in commerce. If I start a competitor of eBay and run it as a sole proprietor, I have every right to refuse service if I don't want to provide it. To *force* me to do otherwise, is nothing but *forced labor*. If I am able to garner "market muscle" all by myself, I have every right to flex that. If I don't want to sell blue t-shirts, it is immoral for the government to *force* me to sell blue t-shirts. If I bring on a business partner (or thousands of business partners) these rights do not go away.

Voluntary exchange (free market) has nothing to do with allowing people to exploit others. In fact, the protection of individuals property rights is essential to a truly free market. It is often government mandated regulations which actually *legalize* violations of property rights. For instance, someone selling a financial product can intentionally deceive you for their own financial gain, so long as they meet government disclosure regulations. Absent these regulations, burying cost information in hundreds of pages of disclosure would reasonably be considered fraud, but once the regulations were introduced to "protect" consumers, customers lost their legal avenue for recourse.

There you go. They don't speak for "the internet" they speak for themselves. Nobody has to be an advocate for the internet because it benefits every user. Widespread adoption speaks for the internet.
Crypto-currency will be no different. When it's utility is great enough for wide scale adoption, it will "speak" for itself. There is no need for a "leader" to be the spokesperson. What you can be sure of though, is that individuals will speak out in their own self interest. If a policy is being suggested that would harm exchanges, you can bet they will speak out. If a policy is being presented that would give one exchange a huge advantage over others through regulatory capture, you can be certain that one company will be the most vocal on that topic.

There is a huge difference between governance and government. Theft is a direct violation of property rights. A stateless society would still have mechanisms to protect property rights.
The real lesson here is that even bitcoiners can't be trusted. This is all the more reason for a truly decentralized system.

How can you be so confident without actually having been through the peer review process with a top journal? Theory is only going to cover a single component of your entire paper.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:28:28
I apologize if I came off as crass. I had interpreted your questions as your "proof" for why it wouldn't work. I've had too many conversations on Reddit where somebody argues that because they (or I) can't come up with an answer to their question, then clearly the theory is flawed. I've had those discussions all too many times around Bitcoin. Somebody demands to know, but what if "xyz" happens? I admit that I have no answer for their question, but somebody more intelligent than I am probably does. They then dismiss the entire argument and see that as proof that they are correct. Again, I apologize, I just thought that was the direction we were headed (I shouldn't assume...).
So as to your questions:


There are lots of different possibilities here. Let's say that I assault you on the street. My act of aggression against you is something you are entitled to compensation for. You may not have a security agency, but let's say that some form of free-market common law has developed a $10,000 fine for assaulting someone. If you have evidence of the assault, you could contact a protection agency. Let's say you have three eye witnesses and some piece of physical evidence that can link me to the crime. The protection agency may feel comfortable taking you on as a client, but may ask for 50% of your settlement in return. $5,000 may be a steep price to pay relative to what it would cost if you simply maintained service, but it still gets you access to justice.
Now, maybe the incidence is extremely mild. Maybe I pushed you causing no physical harm. Maybe this is a minor type of infraction which has a common punishment of $100. Even if you have video evidence, they may not want to take your case. However, because anyone in a free society would be free to start their own protection agency, you would still have some sort of opportunity to seek compensation (due to the fact that you can take the exact same avenue as someone else would). In reality this would probably mean that minor infractions might go unpunished, but anything remotely serious would carry many avenues for justice. 


I think this would really be pretty similar to the case above. Anybody could go without protection, but if any infraction is serious enough they could still seek justice.


This is a possibility, but I don't see what the inherent problem with it is? If I live on a farm and I don't care to pay for a protection agency because I have a shotgun, how am I harming anybody else? I may regret that in the case of some petty vandalism. I may even regret that in the event that I am assaulted as it would cut down on the proceeds I could receive (and the time it could take to receive those proceeds), but part of freedom is my freedom to make a bad decision.


There is no requirement to pay for anything, it will only emerge if there is demand. We already have a large private arbitration system in the US however, so there clearly is demand for these types of services. There wouldn't be the same type of demand for locking people in prison for victimless crimes, but there is still a lot of demand for justice in the event of acts of aggression. 


It's not an end all solution. Just as government can violate authority, private entities can too. The difference is you could hold private authorities accountable for their violations in a way that we can't hold government accountable (i.e. they wouldn't be both the defendant and the judge). You would have other eager entrepreneurs looking for any opportunity to gain competitive edge in the market place. This would help ensure that people are taken care of in a decent way and that opportunistic entrepreneurs will step in hold other entrepreneurs accountable for their mistakes.


There is no way to force anybody to pay for anything. I can't currently force anybody to pay for arbitration services, but there is still a huge arbitration industry. The market arises out of demand.
My apologies again for being rude.

You're falsely assuming that an open platform will yield low quality results. Some used to argue that the ability for "anyone to publish articles" would lead to terrible online content. Of course, terrible content does exist, but reputation and other methods for rating content provides mechanisms to allow high quality content to be widely disseminated.
Github is a perfect example of a decentralized system which provides high quality content without a few "expert" gate keepers.

I didn't deny that they exist, but they represent a tiny minority of journal articles. Also, it's worth noting how many citations are misapplied. Often times researchers don't even read an article, they just look for an argument supporting quote and add in the citation. Other times, citations are put in as a mere formality to pay the "citation toll" to get past editors. Academia is so riddled with problems of concentrating power in the hands of a few, that I have no idea why we would turn to them as an ideal for sharing information in the age of decentralization.

While I agree with what your saying, in terms of a medium of exchange being stable in value, I don't know that this is really representative of Bitcoin right now.

Well, you are asking human beings, so I don't think this is possible, but I'll do my best to identify some downsides (though I certainly believe there more than I'm identifying).
As others have stated, there are likely some forms of exchange conversion fees for parties on both sides of the transaction (since few people earn bitcoins and few people will keep bitcoins for spending). This results in much higher costs than stated.
There is significant volatility risk. Most national currencies won't see double-digit single-day percentage price changes.
There is substantial technology risk. This is improving, but even bitcoin veterans can screw up a transaction. 
There is hacking risk. Bitcoins are much easier to steal (assuming insecure technology use) than many other forms of money.
There is no third party to appeal to if things go wrong. While this is, in my opinion, the ultimate advantage of bitcoin, it does have disadvantages. If I lose my bank account number I can go to the bank and retrieve the information - this isn't the case with wallets. Also, if my bank account is compromised, I have some safeguards to get my funds back. There are no such safeguards in bitcoin.
There is the risk that exchanges will steal your funds.
There is political risk that a nation may declare bitcoin illegal and your funds get trapped in an exchange.
There is a legal risk that a nation may declare you a criminal for transacting in bitcoins.
There is a privacy risk that all transactions are public record on the blockchain.
There is a risk that undetected fatal flaws exist in the bitcoin technology.
There is the risk that something better than bitcoin destroys demand for bitcoin in the market place.
There is probably some risk that natural disaster (possibly a solar flare?) destroys the technology bitcoin depends on.
I should also add that many of the risks I stated above are exacerbated for those in third world countries. That said, people are working every day to address these risks, but there are still many problems that need to be addressed.

Protection from harm is a valid service that people demand. I would question why we have given the government a monopoly over law enforcement, but some level is always going to exist (though a private system of law enforcement certainly wouldn't be arresting millions of people for victimless crimes and develop the highest incarceration rate the world has ever seen).
People also demand certain levels of regulation and the market will provide that. Bitcoin *does* have certain regulations, it just doesn't have government regulations at this point in time. Nobody is arguing for the elimination of all regulation, we are simply talking about who should develop the regulation. Should it be the bankers and their cronies in DC or should we let the market decide?

If you truly believe a free market system (which includes protection of individual's property rights) has ever existed, *you* are incredibly mistaken.
You are entirely missing my point. These periods of "self-regulation" have existed in environments where companies could *legally* violate other's property rights. No market can truly self-regulate when the government has given certain entities special privilege to violate the rights of others. As you are pointing out, when an institution *does* have special privilege to violate others, the violations that can occur are only exacerbated when they are left alone to watch over themselves (i.e. the fox is guarding the hen house). 
The claim that financial institutions have ever been self-regulating in a free market is blatantly and utterly false. The fact that self-regulation doesn't work in unfree markets has no bearing on whether self-regulation can exist in free markets.

I'd venture to say that number is safely in the thousands. How many journals articles can say the same? 
I'm not sure what peer review (if any) Satoshi's article went through prior to publication, but it has received tremendous peer review after publication. Peer review, as it currently exists in academia, is an outdated model. Back in the days when content was distributed via physical mail, peer review prior to publication was far more important. Nowadays, the internet has cut that cost of initial distribution to nearly nothing. The gatekeepers are now far less important. Why should we insist on a more centralized form of peer review?
Edit: If you work in academia and your tenure is dependent on hitting publication requirements, I can certainly see the appeal, but I think a traditional peer reviewed journal will have very little impact on the development of cryptocurrencies.

The thought that law should be based on what's best for "society widely" rather than protecting an individual's rights, is a collectivist type thought that bitcoin supporters should watch out for, because it will certainly be used by those institutions currently in power that want to "protect" consumers from the evils of cryptocurrency.

How do you reconcile these two statements? When an individual is putting money into their 401(k) and investing it, they are doing so in order to "make money for themselves". What would you rather they do with their money? Taking some risk is essential to preserving their capital from losing value due to inflation. 
Now if you want to address some of the agency problems that can arise through IPOs, publicly owned companies, and employee compensation in general, there definitely are legitimate criticisms there; but every investor, regardless of whether they are investing in their own venture or someone else's, is investing because they hope to derive benefit from it.
