Just when I think I'm hip to everything that's going in with Bitcoin and their development, I read a title like this and don't understand half of it...

Well I guess it will be buried now...
I work in a school in the Mental Health filed in King George County, Virginia, a pretty poor area. There is a huge need for stronger Mental Health and Drug Abuse programs in the area. The High School alone has more than 1300 kids, and there is 1 middle school, and 3 Elementary Schools in the area, and there is no reliable Drug program in the County, and there is ONE Mental Health office, with exactly 2 counselors. For the more than 2000 children in public school, their families, and other members of the community, many of which do not have reliable (or any) transportation to go to the center, let alone the various other centers outside of the County, more than 30 minutes away for most.
In addition, the drug epidemic has been spreading, but it's hitting particularly hard in this area. King George is kind of the West Virginia of Virginia, and Opiates are pervasive. Every week we have one of my students family members die from overdose, and even the children are getting into them. As I left work the other day an ambulance pulled up and it was for a child who overdosed in the school (still haven't heard the result). One of my current clients told me about the time they drug their Father into the cold bathtub as they had done countless times before, except this time he never woke up.
It's everywhere, and everyone knows, and there are people that want to help, but there's no way. There are just no facilities in the area, despite numerous pleas to surrounding cities to build satellite facilities. There is a wealth of workers to stock locations and there is plenty of love and care for the area, but nowhere to put anybody. I've even been suggesting it to my company, and it's somewhere on the list of things to do, but I imagine finances is the big issue, because the company would have to build the entire facility themselves, as no one else is.
I don't know that there is a specific charity in the area that would cover this (I looked over King George's charities), nor do I think I would need more than two hands to count the amount of people in King George who know what a Bitcoin is. But the need is there, and if we can just get some facilities set up, we could really save the minds and lives of adults and children for an entire County and community!

I'm in a similar situation where my computer is shutting down trying to sync. It's causing them temperature to go well over 90c and the computer is shutting down because of it.
It's an i7-4k series, 7200RPM drive, 16gb RAM, and downloading the blockchain makes the computer hotter than any game I play. I have the computer in a cold room with the fan on and the laptop fan on fully power (it's an msi with cooler blaster). With all of those precautions I can get it down to 80+. Any ideas?

Only while syncing. And d'oh, why didn't I think of that! I'll try and see.

It seems to be an account that checks purported troll's comment history for other instances of trolling? He said "checking your comments, I'm almost dying laughing, he's not as much a troll in as in @_date: 2014-10-08 14:47:22
Every time I try to run this program with WiFi, my internet connection disables, saying "Network disabled because Internet connection is slow." Is this my ISP blocking it?

Now's my time to shine!

Yay! I've posted enough things on reddit to see a repost/derivative work! I think this make I'm finally a true redditor?

This is the one that I got, though they're out of stock, and I'm not sure how long they have been. They come from Australia.

Yeah, they're definitely buggy, but working. I've withdrawn Fiat and bitcoins over the last 3 days or so, you just have to refresh a couple times.

I've been made!

On one hand, I bought a computer when bitcoin was at around $8,000, so as of current prices, that's pretty good.
On the other hand, I bought 2 Bitcoin tickers for ~$50 each when Bitcoin was at around $300, so those would be like, $600 tickers now...

Any updates on this? I'm in the same boat.
