A long time ago I threw away a tablet with over 12K Doge in it... I wonder how many BTC are lost forever

I think sell and rebuy lower
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:26:01
If you buy at the wrong price then you hold until the right price to sell comes. If you buy high then sell at a lower price, you only have yourself to blame.

Technically she put out a bid and if somebody's ask price is £50 she can buy one for 50
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:36:07
Yeah, that's true. I created a program that auto buys and sells, and it sold at $4,200 and bought some BTC last night at $3800. Selling at $4000 leaves no room for profit after fees.

PSA: If you’re not getting your CBD at a regulated dispensary, you’re getting ripped off.
@_date: 2019-12-20 17:56:20
That was a hypothetical example. No, you have to place a limit order to get the 0.35% fee. It's a bit more work and you may not get your whole order filled immediately.
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:03:18
For example, I say I will buy 1 bitcoin when the price hits 6,900.00. When the bitcoin hits that price, my order will begin to chip away at all the sells that are priced at 6,900.00 until my order has been fulfilled. If I were you I’d do some research on it. It’s not exclusive to crypto trading.

Looks like ACH isn't going to happen and they're going to send me my money via wire transfer:

Your payment may appear as a wire. At the latest, it will come in at 5pm local time if it is ACH or 6pm ET for wires. ([Twitter Link](

I think the issue hasn’t been resolved yet. My boss just sent everyone in the company a notice that they sent out direct deposits but they appear to be delayed. Both my wife and I work different jobs and were supposed to get paid, but we don’t have the direct deposits in our accounts yet.

They have millions of USD in cash to pay their expenses and can absorb the risk of speculation.

Right now it’s 7K. I recommend doing some research because that’s a more complex topic and you should familiarize yourself with how to derive that on your own
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:27:17
Not exactly sure, I wish I could tell the future haha. Just place the order and forget about it, before you know it it’ll fill. I just recommend putting in an order just above a resistance level, not below so you don’t get burned if the value smashes through a resistance level
@_date: 2019-12-20 17:19:53
Use Coinbase Pro

Remember this, you only lose when you sell and you only win when you sell.
When you buy, you are negative, and if you sell before you recoup your investment, you lose.
I am a micromanager so I track EVERY trade I make. I track the quantity and the price I bought it at then I create a “profit price” where I can sell and make a profit even after paying trading fees. If that trade hasn’t made it past the profit price, no matter how low the market goes, I will not sell.
Conversely, after I make a sale, I record the USD value of that trade and will create a “profit price” for the bear. After the trade has crossed that threshold I take the USD value and divide it by the current price, that is the quantity I will buy.
Doing this back and forth for multiple trades takes some discipline, but it exponentially grows my investments in bull and bear markets. 
Hope this helps.

It's funny that you paid in fiat for the shirt
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:37:30
Ah, that’s your mistake right there. Investment funds should be left unspent. Separate your cash piles. One is investment funds, the other is bills funds. When you spend your investment funds, you miss out on the exponential gains. Plus, it’s easy to lose track as to how many gains you’re really generating using your strategy which makes refining your strategy almost impossible.

All these guys look like scammers TBH

Fucking ponzi
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:55:41
Because they are bitter old men that don't like change. They resisted investing into Bitcoin while it was cheap and now they have a deep resentment of the people who got rich off it. They are attempting to sabotage it, but the community stands strong and does not waiver. Eventually they will jump into Bitcoin, but they won't be able to manipulate it like they could have had they jumped in early on.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:49:55
Hell yeah, the pros sold at 4800 and are buying now
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:46:02
So true, the pros are out looking for the floor. The hodl amateurs are taking it personally.
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:30:48
No joke, we're in a bear market. The previous 20% rise after the crash was the bull trap. The decline is real, if you're a trader (not hodlr) you would have cashed out your position a long time ago.

Smart traders sell at the top and buy back when it hits a comfortable floor. Amateurs "HODL" and do not maximize their trading profit potential.

Probably because he bet more than he could lose
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:07:01
Human traders are more likely to lose money because they can't be up 24/7 to monitor those flash crashes and buy/sell opportunities. Now, traders who use bots and tweak those bots to their personal trading strategy are almost guaranteed to win.

The prices will follow what the market dictates. If the market wants to sell, let them. Stop looking at the price and live easily. If you are betting more than you can afford, and it's stressing you out, then sell to cover your expenses or repay your creditors. Only hodl on to what you can afford to lose.

Luck has nothing to do with it. Having parameters and a trading discipline have everything to do with it. You aren't a trader, you are a holder. That's fine, you just won't win in a bear market.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:47:25
Yeah but then your earnings are based in their bitconnect coin which has a relative value to BTC. Then to add more complexity, if you want fiat you have to exchange BTC for fiat at whatever rate it's at. This sounds like a good idea, but it's not if you aren't dealing directly with BTC and fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:55:32

Taxes are based off a percentage from your profits. So you are still taking home a portion of your profits. They don't tax the "principal", only the profits. Why would I want to lose out on take home profits? I don't agree with the "tax loss harvesting" theory.

@_date: 2017-06-15 03:15:00
There are actually 2 values. One is the Bid price, that is the price you'll get if you sell. One is the Ask price, that is the price you'll get if you buy. They are both about 1% above or below the spot price (the price between the Ask and Bid prices)

It's hard to explain in simple terms. Pretty much there was a security flaw in the current bitcoin, so to address the issue and increase security, BIP148 was created. There was a deadline set with BIP148 that says well, if you don't run our shit after August 17, our nodes won't support you. So that means if you are stubborn, and you don't use the new security, the community won't recognize you. That made some people mad and now it's just a shit slinging show. Everyone is scared and confused.
