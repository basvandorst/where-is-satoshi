The exchange just keeps track of how much Bitcoin or USD or Euro etc is in each customer’s account. But the actual Bitcoin or USD etc never moves around until the customers withdraw their Bitcoin or USD etc. The crypto currencies stay in the exchange’s wallets.

Had to open on desktop and register.

I believe for fully trust less side chains these BIPs are required: 
In the mean time RSK is using federation (a set of trustworthy independent entities) to ensure the security of the side chain and over time with increased hashpower and the drive chain BIPs these can be phased out.

My theory is that Bitcoin is valuable in the same way as Facebook is more valuable than if you just got your hands on the source code. You’d have to start your own social network from scratch and convince billions of people and their friends to join.
Over a period of 9 years people bought Bitcoin and by holding and not selling they’ve locked that value into Bitcoin and reinforced the belief that tomorrow Bitcoin will still have value. Like all fiat currency it’s the belief that tomorrow it’ll still have value, sustained over time, that gives it value today.

I think the big increases in SegWit adoption and this decreased congestion will be from exchanges updating their systems.

Do you use something like Cermark?

Proposed release date is May 1st:

It could, but the only way this would be possible would be if your device had hardware and software that you couldn’t access and that retailers also trusted that you couldn’t access. At that point you rule out Android (open source), Linux (open source), etc etc. And you’ve strayed pretty far from Bitcoin’s philosophies into “don’t trust the user, blindly trust processor manufacturers to hide information from users”.

The next major Bitcoin Core release is due in May and it’ll have UI support for Segwit addresses (eg creating a deterministic wallet of Segwit addresses).

The problem there is simply “the owner doesn’t know these keys”. How can you be in possession of the wallet without knowing the keys? A wallet is (at its simplest) just a collection of keys.

I think it’s all for the better since you can prove the contract script to anyone you want to without revealing it to the world and storing it on the Blockchain.

What do you use as a marking solution out of interest?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:40:28
How do you prove you don’t know the keys to the smaller wallets? (PS: I’m genuinely interested btw and I know you’re putting in effort to explain your thinking)

I believe in its current state the crypto marketplace basically is gambling / pure speculation. There’s evidence that the name, logo, hype surrounding a coin have just as much to do with its price trajectory as the technology (if that matters at all right now). 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:46:09
That’s a great question actually. I’d hope that well managed operations would manage this stuff like code so (1) create templates with parameters (eg time locked multisig) instead of storing every one as a custom script (2) store the templates and scripts in a versioned repository like Git or Mercurcial etc with references to the key material  to be used, securely stored elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:21:12
No I haven’t looked into it actually, I wonder how many people are using custom P2SH scripts. Is Hodl Wallet still going btw?

If you owned a huge mining farm (&gt;51% of the total Bitcoin mining hash power in the world) then you could double spend by creating a transaction to a merchant and broadcasting it to all other Bitcoin nodes but not your own. You show the merchant that you’ve sent the transaction and they can even wait for a confirmation.
Then, when the merchant’s given you the goods you create a transaction sending those same funds from yourself to another address you own. Normally this wouldn’t work because the network knows you’ve spent the funds already. 
But, you own 51% of the mining hash power so you have all of your miners work on including the transaction in a block and broadcast it. Then they start working on the next block after that transaction. Now there’s a fork because your half of the Bitcoin network has a block chain where you’ve sent the funds to yourself and the other half has a block chain where the funds went to a merchant.
Eventually, if you sustain 51% of the bashing power you’ll keep adding blocks to your evil chain and broadcasting it and the other half of the network will drop the good chain and build on yours.

Just FYI some of the concerns, like 9.5 and 9.6 are irrelevant because the necessary features have been implemented. The malleability fix is Segwit and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is live too.

Yes, it’s a lightweight wallet that uses Electrum’s servers and the “SPV” protocol to get information about transactions etc instead of downloading the full block chain.

Up until now I’d used paper and occasionally Electrum but having a Ledger Nano is amazing. It feels futuristic, relieves a lot of worry about being hacked and it’s easy to use. The Stellar website has a “Log in with Ledger” button for example.

You can’t really hand over a private key since you’ll still have a copy of it. You could spend the Bitcoin once you’ve left the shop.
