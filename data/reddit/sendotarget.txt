Actually since it it's been remixed, sampled and has video made by the author it can be described as a derivative work not falling under the normal licencing.

It's a tad bit different when you're talking about a music-song and when you talk about an OS.
You can even attach your own copyright to a derivative work in some cases. The video doesn't even represent the song as their own though.
With an OS just changing the name does not make it a derivative work. You would need to rewrite almost the entire thing while keeping just parts of the original to make it fall under a derivative work.
With a music-song used in a video like this where it's mixed, sampled and there's original video from the creator it falls under a derivative work where there's no need for direct compensation for the original.
 I don't think they even care to be honest because most of these songs go viral much better when they're spread far and wide. Lawyers might care though.

I've always thought that if we can buy/own/sell virtual assets for "real" money, why wouldn't we be able to buy/own/sell real world assets with virtual money.
