Mining it with a powerful GPU!

I thought r/btc would teach me a lot about BTC but it just attempted to convince me on it’s fork, BCH.
Beware: bitcoin’com is all about BCH being the origin of BTC, but BTC is the origin of all this in 2008. 
Bitcoin = BTC

It is Bitcoin = BTC, no Bitcoin Core” as the webpage bitcoin’com claims. 
I’m sorry for the loss.

This is hilarious and pretty realistic, for a while now. Beware, posting this meme on r/btc or r/cryptocurrency is surely getting downvoted to hell !

Someone who has a private key with bitcoins in it could give it to you in exchange for something. 
If you trust this person, that is fine. But there is no blockchain check by a miner. 
And, if this person paid fees in the beginning, he would lose anything here. 
GDAX/Coinbase Pro would not charge transaction fees when setting a maker order. 
Exchanges usually charge transaction fees and miner fees. Miners verify whether a transaction is valid in the blockchain.

Do you want to have a cristal clear understanding of Bitcoin?
Read Andreas M. Antonopoulos’ book:
Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies

I accept I cannot change your mind. This reminds me of the $80 million pizzas [read it here](

Yeah, it’s to be tuned to.
