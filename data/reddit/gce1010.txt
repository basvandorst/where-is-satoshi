You’ve got it backwards, deflationary means your money is worth more in the future.
Also he posed a world where only bitcoin is being used. This means there would be no increase in value of bitcoin because there’s nothing to compare it to. Right now when it goes up, it goes up against another currency.

You are right, bitcoin, itself is deflationary.
Imagine an economy that produces 3 apples for 3 citizens and has 6 bitcoin. Each apple will cost 2 bitcoin. Next year the population grows to 6 citizens and the economy has to feed them so it produces 6 apples - each apple only costs 1 bitcoin now. This simple example shows the deflationary nature of a limited supply token like bitcoin.
I’m not saying deflationary tokens are bad. I’m just saying a crypto like bitcoin is deflationary. The dude you responded to has no idea what he is talking about. The fact the he mentioned the price of bitcoin shows he doesn’t understand what he is arguing about.

Nope. You’re wrong. It’s deflationary

I didn’t say bitcoin is doomed. And yeah prices going down forever is not great. It would slow economic growth, as people wouldn’t want to buy things if they are cheaper in the future.

No thanks, I’m good

When people say it’s deflationary they don’t mean the price of btc will go down in usd. You completely misunderstand what bitcoin being deflationary means. 
It means if bitcoin was the only currency around or even if it were used as a currency instead of being an asset - prices of goods would always fall.  This is due to the fact that global production is always rising, as economies and populations grow. If there are more goods that will be limited to the same money (btc) supply then the price of those goods will have to fall

You are correct. The other guy still doesn’t understand that bitcoin’s price has no impact on it being inflationary or deflationary. Also, you are correct that we would just be breaking things down differently.
