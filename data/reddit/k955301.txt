Okay, I think I understand now.
So the gap in services but the elevated tax rates in the US are what fund the military industrial complex held over from WW-II, the cold war, and the continuing warmongering.
If the US reduces it's global military footprint in Europe and Asia it should do a lot for freeing up funds. I doubt the federal government would give the money back, but perhaps our healthcare programs would benefit from it.
Thanks for the insight.

Question here.
In the US, nobody pays this on their entire income. i.e., we don't pay the listed tax rate on our entire income. We pay it on a fraction, reduced by deductions.
So the question is, how to the *actual* rates of taxation compare?

if netflix does this it will be the tipping point for me to use their service.

If you ordered your drink by phone and the transaction completed in this way, the bartender's job actually gets easier. Just watch an incoming queue for drink orders, make it, click done, and use a verification image (perhaps the person takes a selfie) to track down the drinker.

Are there any blogs or sites out on bit coin that report on it like kitco does gold? I like to notion that in order for the asset to hold a specific price it has to have a support of that position. Lose the support (e.g., transaction volume, introduction of a new mining operation, etc).
What are the key supports for bit coin? So far I have the following (as a noob):
* mining difficulty
* computing capacity
* government positions
* vendor adoption
What else should be considered when deciding if the price is sustainable? It seems like there have to be others since only government opinion is subjective. The rest hint that the price would be extremely predictable.
Thoughts? What am I missing?
