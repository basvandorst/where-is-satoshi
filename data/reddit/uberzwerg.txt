Its 'easy' to do that with a small company without a bazillion dollars of market value and a million shareholders who will kill you if you just dump the company to avoid following court order.

Serious question from a crypto noob:  
As i understand it, signing of transactions and is really some kind of bottleneck of the whole currency and gets slower and more expensive from day to day.  
And i read that about 0.1% of the worlds electricity consumption is already going into cryptocurrency mining and signing.  
With bitcoin getting more and more expensive, there is more energy pumped into the whole thing.  
Does anyone bother thinking about the ecological consequences, or are my informations wrong?

I don't believe, that conventional money uses up more energy than crypto does at the moment.  
Including the whole concept of banking wouldn't be right because "handling of money" is just a small part of banking - stuff like loans are far more relevant and are not directly tied to what currency is used.  
And 99.99+ % of all transactions are done with traditional money and just imagine the kind of enery that would be required if you could really compare both worlds and have 50% done in crypto.  
Many modern crypto currencies could handle a huge amounts of transactions far better than Bitcoin, but we're here in and need to talk about where the journey goes for that.

Ecologic - not economics

He's probably already deep into bitcoins and seeds this picture to increase the value a percent for a few days.  
Enough to make a few more millions from selling.
