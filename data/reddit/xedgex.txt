Don't become a slave to a bank by taking out a mortgage, cash out and buy a house.  Keep working and finally start to save some money. I would sit on the remainder of the BTC stash. Remember you probably have $200k right NOW in the altcoin Bitcoin Cash, perhaps just cash out using that?  It may be enough for a house.
