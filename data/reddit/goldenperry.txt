Very true. I dumped some savings a few weeks ago and got a second bitcoin. So now I'm in the 10.5 million club (or 8 million club)

K thanks
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:20:34
The latter
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:35:53
Thank you!

That would be the 1 Million Club
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:16:13
The math has been done, many times. It's still called the 21 Million Club
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:03:59
I have 27k in my fiat savings account
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:46:19
I'll buy more when it does
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:33:13
This is just a pit stop. Still investing

As long as I'm holding a Bitcoin, I've lost nothing. The day I sell for 6k, I've lost 4k.

Hence the posting on one of my wiped throwaways using a public internet connection.

They can try
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:15:19
I have it spread out across several wallets
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:31:15
and when it goes up again, I'll have 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:13:57
It's a jumble of people that are happy for me and FUDers

The investor's mantra
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:01:42
I didn't just buy in now. I've been steadily investing no matter the price. I bought at 3700. I bought at 17k.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:01:33
No. I'm up 1
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:05:02
It's not about the number of people. It's about the number of Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:02:08
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:30:19
I wouldn't compare Bitcoin to stock. You can though, I don't care
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:02:15
I have other investments, no other crypto
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:14:07
I can't help that. Just know that it's the status name coined for anyone that owns at least 1 BTC

I am no one to give financial advice, however that's what I've been doing

One day you'll be two humans. I believe in you
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:25:21
Then maybe you should do some research instead of asking random people on Reddit
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:24:28
Well that's just completely inaccurate. Good job
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:29:59
You're very opinionated for an uneducated idiot
