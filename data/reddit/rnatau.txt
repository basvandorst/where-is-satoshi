I need to find myself a better page for finding actual transaction fees... 126 is of course enough currently, according to your excellent page ;-) 
Still all these people claiming "there's no problem, because right now it kinda works" are a pet peeve of mine... I've paid many Satoshis lately to get good confirmation times. Yes, segwit enabled transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:37:55
One may argue that you got lucky to get fast confirmation while underpaying significantly.
Addendum: I'm not saying SegWit does not work per se - I'm just saying that OP's argument is stupid, he got lucky and/or was priorized due to other circumstances, and has nothing to do with him using SegWit.

Is that a valid address, btw? I don't know the bech format so well.
 says 0, but here's an example of an existing address: 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:30:05
Yeah, that's a bech encoded address - nobody forces you to use this encoding with SegWit. Although it's neat, it's still not the standard.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:22:21
There's posts where you can tell they have understood the joke. 
Then there's those that clearly haven't.
And then there's this post, where I really can't tell ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:33:23
I know that mechanism (which is a tad more complicated than you make it out to be), but I mean an additional incentive for SegWit transactions...
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:22:15
I'm starting to wish for a log(log()) scale, actually :-)
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:28:35
What? That is not true, where do people get these "infos" from....
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:30:51
If miners would prioritize SegWit transactions, at least SegWit would start to gain traction... As in "reserve half the block for SegWit", or something...
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:27:01
Minimum fee is 1/226sat/B, so 1 cent @ 1 million.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:37:35
Soooo that's why by default you get a legacy address?
People need to offer SegWit by default, otherwise it'll never gain traction. That's btw also true for e.g. Bitstamp - at least existing customers have to actively switch their deposit address to SegWit, at least that was the way it was implemented in the beginning.

*4.3.6 Bitcoin als Schneeballsystem?
Wie u.a. im Postulat Schwaab (13.3687) wird immer wieder die Frage aufgeworfen, ob Bitcoin
als unzulässiges Schneeballsystem qualifiziert werden kann.
Da im Fall von Bitcoin die bei Schneeballsystemen
typischen Gewinnversprechungen fehlen, ist nicht von einem Schneeballsystem auszugehen.
Zudem sind die einzigen monetären Vorteile, die bei der Verwendung von Bitcoin
erwartet werden können, geringe oder wegfallende Gebühren.*
My quick translation:
**"4.3.6 Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?**
Time and time again, the question is asked: Can Bitcoin be considered an illegal Ponzi Scheme?
As in the case of Bitcoin the typical promises of financial gains are missing, Bitcoin can not be considered a Ponzi Scheme. Additionally, the only financial benefits that can be expected when using Bitcoin are low or inexistant fees."

Because of [this discussion]( which sparked all of this:
The payment takes a while to be processed, or may not reach the network at all. It also works really badly in crowded environments like bars.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:57:35
I would assume a lot of people reported this issue, but they just took their time. On the bright side: they seem to have a good issue management: I also received their "issue resolved" notice :-)

Because of this post I looked for a way to get Soylent in Europe, and found a dutch guy producing a copy, "Joylent".
Ordered with Bitcoins, and it seriously was the most simple process EVER! Now let's hope the goods are good :-)
@_date: 2014-01-08 11:32:59
Very nice! I really like how your approach solves so many problems at once:
* queuing
* authentication (via the claim image)
* avoids the bitcoin payment delay
* ...
only big point i don't like that much: the confirmation gesture - this one implies that the server has to handle and touch the customer's device, which creates risks (and some just might not like it).
@_date: 2016-12-06 12:07:26
"Where is Bitcoin headed?" - Best question of them all!
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:19:00
It seems to be incredibly slow without any feedback... Give it a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:38:34
Big props to cash for taking action - even though they did not see Clashic coming ;-) 
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:37:43
Okay, only just a very quick plausibility check should tell you that 4 out of 242 can't be 99.98%
In fact, (242-4)/242*100 = 98.34% uptime.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:22:37
Wait, did I just do your homework or something? :-P
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:02:53
Yeah, seems tooootally legit.
Edit: Especially considering the number of scams around cloud mining, and the fact, that if you want to get into bitcoin, mining has not been the way to go for a long time.

The answer is right here in this thread - [here](
His proof just did not hold up under public scrutiny, and he refused to give stronger proof.

Great intro, but especially in such a basic intro some points may lead to confusion for the newbie...
* Clarify from the start that bitcoins are dividible, not just "max 21 million" (yes, you mention it later on, but by then the confusion has happened)
* The section concerning keys is somewhat inaccurate. Keys are not generated by the blockchain, nor are they generated when bitcoins are bought or sub-divided. That's pretty important when talking about cold storage, for example. Instead, the private key is generated by your computer, and the public key is derived from your private key. Later on, you talk about that giving away your keys is dangerous - here it should be made clear that is only true for the private key (yes, some people claim disclosing the public key is bad as well, but that's a very minor point....)

Those are, hands down, my favorite charts at the moment. It's just too fascinating to watch this major change happen!
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:35:08
Exactly - See also this submission by me:

If you look closely at the data, 100% segwit happens at segwit party for empty blocks with a segwit coinbase transaction. The other site does not consider coinbase transactions at all. Overall it does not matter, because the long term trend is calculated as  so singular outliers do not skew the result (on segwit party).
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:23:03
Might be, but I don't think many wallets even have so many small enough inputs to combine that this would be a factor. Would be interesting though to analyze how the transactions typically look...
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:32:11
This is how other pools look:
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:10:04
Interestingly, the average witness size went down lately. To me that's a sign of mainstream adoption for "simple" transactions with few inputs, as opposed to exchange-style transactions with many inputs.
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:20:12
That really does it for me. I've had my doubts about both sides of the debate, actually, but trying to pass this off as replay protection really shines some light not only on the motivation, but also on the technical expertise of the people involved in S2X...
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:41:53
The calculation on that site seems to be a little off. Probably they just average the block percentages, which is mathematically nonesense. Segwit party is the better source - i reviewed and fixed the algorithm there ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:40:27
As other have already pointed out, the "Emergency Difficulty Adjustment" EDA leads to [huge difficulty swings]( that are being abused by miners.
Thats why the [blockchain height]( is higher, and therefore the total coin supply too.
Case in point: currently there are [22 Blocks/hour]( being mined on the BTC chain...
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:22:56
They could have used this update to also change their max block size... Unfortunately still always &lt; 1Mb: 
(Yes, sometimes they do in fact produce blocks just the tiniest bit over 1Mb. But not significantly, like it would be possible thanks to SegWit)
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:58:01
Yeah, what's up with that? Everybody does, in fact it's something they don't even have control over.
This is in no way frontpage-worthy, except to call them out on their shenanigans!
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:14:09
No, actually Antpool is mining bigger blocks, but apparently not on all of their hosts as there's always some 1Mb-Blocks interspersed.
F2Pool is the biggest pool not mining bigger blocks right now, and of course Roger... But he hardly matters in the big picture.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:06:28
Nope, transactions to Segwit addresses are not counted, only transactions from Segwit addresses. Because only transactions from Segwit addresses are Segwit transactions...

Well, there's nothing "explained" about Bitcoin whatsoever, but it's very amusing nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-05-01 07:38:52
Asking the important questions! There seems to be a reason for BitFinex being so high, but why Coinbase? Respectively, why is Bitstamp so low?
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:09:25
Only ever cash out fractions of your holdings, is my advice.
If 10% are the down payment for your house, go for it.
But don't be that idiot posting a couple of weeks ago "I blew all of my Bitcoin on a house yay!", because you will regret that.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:44:54
According to some, it's currently hard to get fiat out of Bitfinex, which would drive the price up.
