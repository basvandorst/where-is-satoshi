Whatever, dick. I don't care about your opinion on the matter. So go ahead and respond to this so you can have the last word and we'll be done with it. Doucher.

Well, thanks for your help. I guess. *cough*prick*cough*

Yeah dude. Stating I don't know how to get into it is totally begging. Had I known about Circle or Coinbase, I would have been buying in when I first heard people were using crypto. Now that I know where to look into buying, that's the plan. So suck a dick, doucher.

It was a statement about how I don't know how to get into crypto currencies. The topic of the thread was tipping, that is true. I would like to be able to tip people as well. I didn't know how to start. Your little club looked like so much fun from the outside.

I really would like to get into bitcoin but I don't have the power to mine or the money to buy. I don't understand how everyone does it :(

I was raised Jehovah's Witness and was never allowed to say the pledge of allegiance at school. When I got out of school and out of the religion, I just never did it. I have never pledged allegiance to the flag.

Watching that skit actually made me realize I'd never done it. One of my faves.
