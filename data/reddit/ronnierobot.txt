wherever I go I look for these and never find any.  Even a map showing where they are is often wrong

depends on what the question is.
Would you like fries with that?  I would not answer with HODL.
Did you favour free trade.  I would not answer with HODL.
So no HODL is not my answer to everything.  I think it would be odd to have one answer to every question, that would make you very annoying

Depends how well I teach her.

Thanks, i think I was just over thinking it

So you can only sell BTC to new investors coming in?
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:58:01
From the video it sounds like they would hold so many bitcoins but sell more than they have in paper coins.  So they could sell more than 21 million.  His video explains it much better.  Comes across like institutions taking over Bitcoin.

Traditional way of reading it does not work
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:11:03
No one indicator on its own will work.  RSI is a waste of time.  However there are some good indicators out there.  its finding a few that work well together.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:27:07
try the SSL Channel and the DPO, those are two of my favourites.  I only trade on the daily chart, so any shorter time frame Im not sure how they would do.  Both are good for entry, SSL good also for exit.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:35:40
I do use the stoch RSI but I adjusted the default settings on it.   Don't use MACD anymore.   I did use 20 day moving average but now rely on SSL channel.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:10:33
There are better indicators
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:37:35
Finance sounds better
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:11:32
Most people think it does.  How many people use this as their only indicator.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:15:03
most people fail at trading cause they don't invest the time to learn.  nothing is guaranteed, indicators can help. Or become a bank and just control the markets.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:24:50
I don't ever expect to sell at the top or buy at the bottom.  Just gotta work the middle.

If you've not noticed how dips there have been and it's still going lower.  So that theory sucks.  Just adding to your losses sounds like a good plan.  Call it DCA or whatever it's still losing money ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:19:30
Me too.  One of the few times I should of listened to my wife
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:01:13
Jesus that's bad.  Just don't sell and hope in a year or so you recover.

I need some tips from you.  How did you get her to go?
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:26:04
Then hold your course
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:18:29
Not sure jumping at every dip is the answer.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:45:16
Lesson learned pay off debts first then worry about lambos 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:10:08
Might be ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:12:27
Probably a good idea
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:16:58
Thanks for doing work for me
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:17:49
But I've also missed the last ten dips people bought in at
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:08:33
Alot of self harmers out there
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:15:12
Only the scammers can afford such luxury
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:17:16
Last time I used them it took much longer than expected but it arrived eventually.  Asking for cash usually comes quicker if they still offer that option
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:50:34

Yeah takes the piss after all that video editing
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:19:04
Hold and wait.  Rather catch it going up than down
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:32:30
Yes 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:07:46
And a green one for the original lambo
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:42:41
could be for Ethereum, they should of been less specific and asked if it was crypto related.
@_date: 2018-07-25 04:11:44
seems optimistic
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:07:38
my altcoins might have suffered tho
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:08:23

I find myself extremely  under-qualified, but would love to have it as well
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:41:49

Can you explain?
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:30:01
good idea, or learn how to bake
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:21:07
I made a video about that, my editing skills are less than optimal tho.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:07:13
