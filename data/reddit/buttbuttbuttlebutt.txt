No. 


It would hemorrhage money as soon as you plugged it into the wall.

They don't have to put fees on the junk at all, or even broadcast it before the block is made.

Yes, they include address-txid maps for arbitrary addresses which no full node needs (full nodes don't even store a single bit about addresses they don't already own).

We do no such thing. The hardcoded seeds are a fallback only and are not used in any normal conditions. Generally if you are hitting the seed nodes, something is so wrong that you'll never make a connection to the network anyway, to get there you need to have failed all the peers you know about already, and failed to reach any of the DNS seeds.

SPV is just talking about weak validation using the merkle tree proofs, it has nothing to do with BIP37 bloom filters. You can be SPV without using the Bitcoin wire protocol at all, like Electrum. BIP37 in a lot of ways is stupidly suboptimal for everyone, especially the nodes servicing it.

Skip mining, haul yourself straight to jail. You're not the first to think of that.

Welcome, just be sure to not take cryptosystem design critique too personally. Most of the science is being able to break other people's systems and learning from that. Anybody can design something they themselves can't break, it's making things others can't break that's the real challenge.

Fees are paid to the miner who mines the block. 
It's totally costless for a miner to make an infinite (sans block limit) sized block filled with junk.

Except Electrum.

Block validity rules based on fees would just mean the person includes transactions with lots of fees paying themselves. Nothing changes.

They have acted as BIP37 "servers" since 0.8.


Electrum server stores 30GB more indexes than Bitcoin Core and takes months of precomputation, as such this will never be part of the core client as a result.
