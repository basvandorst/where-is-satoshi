It does matter, yep. You'll want to transfer money through CoinBase, then buy using limits on GDAX to avoid fees.

Yeah, less (no?) fees if you buy through GDAX. You can also deposit money from your linked bank account that you have setup from Coinbase via GDAX. (In GDAX, go to "Deposit", then the "Bank Account" tab, and you should see your bank account that you setup there).

GDAX was showing it over 16k at around 9:20 EST.

I've only sold once just to understand the mechanics of it, but yep, I did so through GDAX.

If I told you, would you believe me?

Yeah - I'm a relative noob here. I had moved all of the Bitcoin I was buying from Coinbase onto a Trezor, but it sounds like the obvious thing to do here is to move it back to Coinbase and take the free B2X? Any of the seasoned vets think this is a sketchy / dumb strategy?

Not the guy you responded to, but it's a little weird to call these sorts of stories out as frequently as they are. The same sort of thing applies to practically any lucrative investment ever given hindsight; it's nothing unique to bitcoin.

That makes perfect sense. Thanks!
