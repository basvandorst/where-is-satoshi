This guy is bombarded with sympathy PM's asking for bitcoin due to "personal/special circumstances, I guarantee it.

and that is why you chose them? 
1. have you documented criteria that you used to select and monitor service providers?
1. Are there service provider agreement between you and uphold?
1. have you communicated your service provider decision to your clients?
1. have you documented the delegated responsibilities (from you to Uphold) and communicated them with your clients?
maybe you are making sure that your complaint is surfaced before your clients' so that you appear to be the victim, but I really hope a reddit post that cries "I got scammed, so unfair" is not a **settlement** worth 200 bitcoins, because at the end of the day, your clients are the ones taking the blow.

Stating the obvious there, given the score to the right.

Something doesn't add up. I may be wrong but this smells like a shill post.

If you don't think you can live off the appreciation of 1.8M, you are an idiot. an idiot cannot be forward-thinking enough to have bought 200 bitcoin. 10/10 fake.

Yes uphold likely will get sued for this but I think OP is **ultimately** responsible (Fiduciary Responsibility).

This shows that bitcoin is still in its early days due to complete lack of regulations (Prudent man rule, Fiduciary responsibility, etc.). 
It is highly unlikely that OP, being someone in the bitcoin business, was completely unaware of Uphold's reputation. So two possibilities: 
1. he used Uphold for convenience or lower fee or whatever short-term gain
1. he is an accomplice, getting a cut for such a large amount of money. (even 20% would be 20 BTC)

A direct quote from the article:
"In 2013 a bubble burst within Bitcoin when the **demand** rose so quickly that the market could not support it, with the value plunging from $1,300 USD to $200 USD. "

I like this guy's way of explaining things (he would make a really good professor if he gets a PhD someday imo), and he seems like a genuinely nice guy!
