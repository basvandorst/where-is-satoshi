Here's a chart for you :) 
Also check  (tab "Distributions")
TL/DR: On 01/26/2016 there's around 524,000 addresses with a balance greater than 1btc
- A single person may control several addresses (actually it's even recommended)
- A single address controlled by a service like Coinbase is likely to hide a lot of bitcoin users.

ELI5: Transactions are inserted into blocks which have an associated timestamp. These timestamps aren't very precise (tolerance margin of a few hours) but when you aggregate timestamps related to transactions received/sent by a user or an address, things get a bit more interesting. This is especially true, when you add the hypothesis that most humans sleep 7-8 hours per day during the night.
The bad news:
Block timestamps are unreliable for 2 reasons: the tolerance margin and the delay between the broadcasting of the transaction and its insertion into a block. But a monitoring node tracking the date &amp; hour of reception of transactions may apply the same heuristic with a much better precision.
The good news:
- Information leaked isn't very intrusive (rough estimate of the regional location)
- It's easy to trick this heuristic (especially if you're a vampire or a nightclubber)
Anyway, this is a good example of how metadata (even the less reliable ones) can be used to gather information.

Correct. For now, blocks are processed with a delay of a few hours (30 blocks).

I'm not sure to deserve so much praise but thanks !

Not yet. I hope it will become open source in the future but I can't give a ETA (code not ready for prime time, missing documentation, resources for support, ...).

I've just made a quick check with OXT.
Here's the address ( clustered by OXT into this entity: 
A few observations about this entity:
- mainly composed of multisig addresses (2 of 3)
- high number of transactions seems to indicate that transactions are managed by an automated process
- a peak of activity can be observed on november &amp; december 2015 which may correspond to observations made for several exchanges (correlated with the bitcoin price rising).
- a peak of volume transfered by the entity can be observed on august 2015
On the other hand, here are a few observations related to BITFINEX as currently identified by OXT (
- mainly composed of multisig addresses (2 of 3)
- high number of transactions seems to indicate that transactions are managed by an automated process.
- low peak of activity in november and december 2015 which is surprising for an exchange
- high volume of bitcoins sent on august 2015 (every 6 days) with a sharp decrease of the estimated balance (-164,000BTC) 
- low number of adresses used after august 2015
- temporal patterns of activity (in particular, hours associated to outgoing txs) may be compatible with those observed for the other entity.
Considering all these observations, the hypothesis that Bitfinex has migrated some of their wallets in August 2015 and that this address may be related to Bitfinex doesn't seem too bad. Anyway, it's just a quick &amp; dirty analysis done in 10mn.
EDIT: FWIW, here's a transaction from July 2015 ( sending 2,500btc from Bitfinex to the entity associated to this address. That may confirm the hypothesis of an address related to Bitfinex.

Well, another service controlling this address may be a possibility but, imho, bitfinex remains the most plausible hypothesis.
I've just done an additional check. A db request returns 618 transactions from Bitfinex to this entity, with a total volume of 291,944 btc.
