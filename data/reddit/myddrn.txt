Some kind of key for what the colors mean and what the heights mean.  And maybe lighten up the globe a little bit, or make the tall black spikes a different color. Otherwise issick, would click again.

I'm expecting this to happen again, and again, and then another time.  There are a lot of new exchanges popping up, a lot of tasty targets. The issue, as I see it, is that there is a new lucrative market opening up and every web developer's cat wants to get a piece of it.  For some reason they don't teach cats about SQL injection and CSRF in school. 
After MtGox gets put back together I'd venture a guess that they'll be one of the more secure exchanges for a while.  Which doesn't give me a whole lot of comfort, but it's a start.

I've also got a 6970 and get a consistent 360 ~ Mh/s, what is your miner software setup?
@_date: 2011-07-13 04:05:04
Makes sense. What is the biggest problem?

There is a joke in here somewhere about MtGox.

Cases also serve as a support for PCI cards.  Some, the ones that are two slots tall, of the video cards used to do mining have issues with being too bulky for the PCI slot alone to hold up.

[en.bitcoin.it wiki article on the scalability of the network](
@_date: 2011-06-12 01:20:54
This [chart]( is a pretty good reference.  From the looks of it you'd pull in about 30 MegaHashes/Sec, which according the [mining calculator]( would net you about 0.05 bitcoins a day at the current difficulty(567358.224571).  So a modestly small sum.  However, we need to take into account that the difficulty is going to continuously shift every 2016 blocks.
[Bitcoincharts.com]( provides an estimate of the next difficulty (818938 at time or writing) which will shift in approximately [this many seconds]( 
Plugging the estimated new difficulty into the hash calculator gives us 0.04 bitcoins per day. 
The difficulty increases as the computational power of the network increases.  There has been a bit of an, ah, influx, so to say, of computational power in the past few months as we can see by the [difficulty over time graphs](  The difficulty scales so that blocks are created at a fairly consistent rate, but is limited to a multiple of four each jump (as far as I can remember from reading lots of wiki pages).
All of this is assuming that you join a pool.  If you are doing solo-mining we can use the [old calculator]( (note that it measures in kilohashes so we have to convert) to find the follow statistics, given 30,000 KiloHashes/Sec at a difficulty of 567358.224571.
    Probability	Time
    Avg	        940 days, 3 hours, 10 minutes
    50%	        651 days, 15 hours, 35 minutes
    95%	        2816 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes
That may give some insight on why people started doing pooled mining. 
So, if you are going in this to make money, I'd say it'll only work if you can get your electricity for free.  I did some benchmarking with a 6970 card running full blast and came to about 7.8 Kilowatt hours/day.  Yours would probably be lower than this.  Your electric bill should tell you your cost/kilowatt hour.  The average is about 11 cents/kilowatt hour, highest is about 30 cents (go Hawaii!) and the lowest is about 7.3 cents (powerpowerpower in North Dakota) according to [eia.gov](
Hope that helps.

EC3 eh? Is EC4 next?

Is the part where the price in of registering a .bit domain goes down in relation to the number of blocks in the namecoin blockchain not enough to make the destruction rate fairly reasonable? Or is it more that there is a method build into the system that destroys coins?

JS crypto code would absolutely work. It's just that it's a Bad Idea and shouldn't be done for the reasons stated in the aforementioned linked rant.
Regarding extensions/addons/etc: Yes. If I remember correctly that is one of the tangents the author of that post goes into, briefly. If not, it's one that commonly comes up. And there are people out there that have done that (ex:[FireGPG]( - defunct, sadly). Still, you must properly implement security controls and know how to write crypto code so that you don't compromise the confidentiality(integrity, authenticity) of your users's data. And I think that's one of the main points here, crypto code is Hard and Dangerous.
I always have mixed feelings about that sentiment because I feel like it has the potential to scare off budding potential crypto-code writing programmers, but at the same time I'd like to see the incidents of massive computer security insanity due to shoddy code kept to a minimum.

There are apps out there like [BitcoinDroid]( that will interface with a wallet sitting on a computer somewhere else via ssl so that if you destroy your phone it's no big shakes.  Currently BitcoinDroid only does status queries.  Hopefully the developer(s) will expand it to support transactions.  This still leaves you with the issue of the phone being stolen and the wallet emptied.  Some kind of verification password upon transaction would probably be a good idea.

All his quotes that are taken out of context that I don't feel like looking up.
But srsly
I like his stances on civil liberties, usually, not a huge fan of the immigration and abortion stuff.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:48:26
Correct.  Some mining programs have options that allow you to limit the amount of resources they use, basically making them stop running for a number of milliseconds every cycle to cut down on power usage/heat generation.  However, this will cut down on your hash rate.
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:23:15
Very good point, I didn't think of that.  
Other thoughts:
I'd tend to agree with the ~~~creator's~~~your(icanliteracylol) [comment]( that it's probably not a great idea to store a bunch of bitcoins in one of these because whatever account you get will show up on your computer until you clear your cookies.  The issue being computers where more than one person would have access.
Also, if anyone figures out the URL generation scheme that'll be a fun day for everyone using the system.  When you get enough value in a target, people tend to invest time in figuring that stuff out.  
I love the ease of use of this system, but the amount of potential value spread across everyone's accounts makes me a little nervous.  Meaning that even if no one stores more than a bitcoin in their accounts, if say a hundred people do that, you figure out the url generation algorithm and write a script to pull the page and send all the bitcoins off to an address if there are any in the account. 
Something like this implemented with a pseudorandom url + yubi-key(or similar token), I could get behind.
edit: I can actually read, no really I swear.

I used [this]( guide to get setup, everything worked out better than expected.  Most other *nix guides try to get you to download the ATI drivers and generate the packages locally, I never had any luck with that.
