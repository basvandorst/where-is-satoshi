Shitty advice for a 16y/o. Ignore all future costs because you're financially free now! It's not like people are going to college and coming out with big fat loans.

A 16y/o kid shouldn't be spending all this money. If he won $10k USD you most people would suggest he saves and invests. So him spending it is artificially forcing the economy.
Same as people who put money into bitcoin jsut to spend it straight away. You're actually eliminating the point of it by intentionally making it harder for yourself just to support bitcoin.
Like I said, if bitcoin is really that great it will be adopted by the market because it's good, not because it has a lot of transactions that have been forced.

I wouldn't recommend him keeping money in bitcoin at all...
In his situation
Diverse investment plan (maybe including some money in bitcoin) &gt; taking all his money out of bitcoin &gt; leaving all his money in bitcoin &gt; spending his money on stuff that won't have any long term value

The network subsidy can never be zero. How on earth to you expect the hashing power to be paid for exactly?

Probably can't. My Dad used to work at a small branch like this as part of his job. He and a few others would have to drive 3 hours to get there, open up for a few hours and then drive home. Wasn't practical to open up at other times.
Besides, most the locals were farmers and such so they didnt really have work hours as such

Marketing... Why would he make an announcement like this if not to ride the publicity and hype surrounding Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:20:32
That's bad logic. If bitcoin has to rely on people spending money for the sake of supporting bitcoin, how is it ever expected to be successful when it's artificially being made it look useful?
If bitcoin is going to be successful it will be natural market demands and needs, not by artificially forcing it to work.

That's a copypasta from You're not very good at this apparently.

1) The previous post was nothing to do with disliking bitcoin, it's about your argument being ridiculous
2) Thank, but I'd rather not take investment advice off a .jpg

And thus... bitcoin was overstocks best marketing campaign ever

Non-sequitur. Whatever the rule is of banking systems in no way makes bitcoin any less risky....
Also bitcoin isn't a bank.

He might only be paying 1cent or whatever for that transaction, but then he's also paying 1cent for the next 40,000 transactions that are not his.
It may favour those who use many transactions, but those who don't use any are effectively "paying" for all the these transactions that don't even involve them.

That isn't what matters though. What affects the market is the perception of your average customers. Most people seeing the price plummeting and don't think "wow bitcoin has so much cool new features, I want to use this". They are more worried about losing money on sales and trades so are not willing to use bitcoin at the moment in such a volatile state
