I got word from an employee that all Nordea employees will be prohibited to buy and trade cryptocurrencies starting in February.

Yea, you're right, who's ever going to need phone books or maps or calling on the internet... We've got perfectly working solutions for that already. I mean, everyone would need some kind of a personal device for this to be viable. Have people never seen a computer - it takes up a whole bloody room!

Can’t wait to sell the news! It’ll be glorious!

Define fair.

I was more thinking of what is a fair system of distribution if Bitcoin is to be a new world monetary base. 
To me, a deflationary issuance where early participants are exponentially more rewarded the more people try to cram in seems quite unfair. 
Maybe someone can convince me otherwise.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:16:56
I wasn’t implying we should distribute equally. I don’t know what a good distribution mechanism would be and I certainly think that those that hold considerable power in the current world economic system will not be silly enough to let it slip completely and start at the bottom of the food chain in a Bitcoin centric world.

It looks to me it’s setting up for a nice parabolic fall, I’ll sell the news, you can do what you want ;)
Apparently whoever’s downvoting me doesn’t understand that you can be a Bitcoin supporter and at the same time appreciate a good trading opportunity.

The name is Turing, Alan Turing. I'll take that shaken, not stirred.

Edit: I see this could be read both ways. Clarification FU gov and retarded social norms, rock on Turing, whichever way you swung.

For now greed and FOMO have taken over. Sweeping the scaling issues under the rug, I'm sure, will come back with a vengeance.

Good point. Then let’s say you get three mining pools, each with say 20% hash power. Let’s say a block is worth 100k usd. Wouldn’t it be so that each of the mining pools has an expected average profit of 20k for each block. If you were to offer them the same deal to run the software to produce a malicious block in one of the next 10 blocks, paying them 20k plus whatever the opportunity cost is, it should be in their economic interest to do so.
The opportunity cost would then be calculated on the expected potential future loss of profit, which as I said earlier could be offset by shorting the market, and making extra profit there, knowing that you’re going to cause havoc panic and loss of value.
I don’t know, maybe I’m missing something, but it seems to me that there might be a valuable argument somewhere here :) Namely that it might cost far less to attack the network this way, than it would cost to buy up and own half of the hashing power.

You're welcome. I have to say I find it quite surprising you should care enough to personally greet me. Charmed.
Edit: I just want to add that my comment was not meant as schadenfreunde, although I realise it can be read as such. What I meant was that I think Bitcoin is currently overpriced and that the scaling issues might come back when the bull run settles.
I wish all the best of luck and prosperity to all the people and all the platforms (regardless of the fact that my ideological allegiance lies more with Ethereum than Bitcoin).
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:09:25
I think what he’s implying is that if a someone offered 95k or whatever it was to rewind 1 block by running a specific software to all the mining pools, it should be in their economic interest to do so, because that’s the max they could’ve earned anyway.
I think it’s an interesting thought. I guess you’d have to offer quite a bit more because you’d have to pay them off for spitting in their own bowl because by doing so bitcoin’s reputation and thus their (the co-conspirator miner’s) future earnings would be reduced.
Even so, I’m not an economist, but I reckon you should be able to calculate a price where the incentive to break bitcoin is large enough, and possibly much smaller than owning 50% hashpower. Especially so if you’re a miner and you think the price will tank anyway, heck you might even want to do it on purpose, short the market and make a killing.

Yes, an order that the exchange puts out based on their cost of acquisition of new coins, their cost of business and profit margin.

As much as I agree with you, I think you fail to mention that this is a relatively new market with clearly a lot of emotions attached to it for reasons such as incredible price swings, technology affiliation, anti-establishment sentiment, etc. Therefore I think it's quite natural that there is a lot of hype and panic. I'm more of the: nothing to see here, move along type, but for many people this is an emotional rollercoaster.
