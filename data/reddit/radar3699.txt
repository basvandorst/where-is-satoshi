Guys i'm sorry and I know i'm going to get unbelievably down voted for this but if you've studied economics from ***any*** school of thought whatsoever you'll understand how stupid this post is. 
The reason the dollar isn't linked to something like gold is ***precisely fucking because*** the supply of gold is arbitrarily determined by how much gold is mined every year. This gives money linked to it a somewhat arbitrary value and leads to a whole bunch of financial shittyness that I don't want to go into the details of. You want the supply of money be equal to real output in the economy. Hundreds of years ago the amount of gold mined was roughly correlated with real output in the economy, so money was linked to gold and it worked out well enough for the time but by today's standard we would consider still fucking awful. Financial crisis after financial crisis. 
What you essentially want is the money supply to roughly equal real output in the economy. E.g. If the economy grows 3% in one year, the government prints 3% more money. This would give zero inflation but the government tends to print slightly more than that (which is why there's inflation) to have control over intrest rates, essentially giving policy makers a "lever" they can pull up or down at various market cycles to keep the economy stable. Without this ability you're back in the dark ages (literally) and suffering financial crises all the damn time.  
Bitcoin is not the same thing as the US dollar or British pound, but you can buy things with it which by definition makes it money. From the lens of bitcoin as money (rather than a security) having a "limited" supply that's increases by an exponential decay over time that's completely uncorrelated with economic activity ***is a BAD thing, NOT a good thing - for the same reason we don't link dollars to gold any more.***
