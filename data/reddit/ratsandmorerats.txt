That's interesting, because if I had $400M of other people's money, I wouldn't ever, ever, ever tell them where it was.  Even if you put me in jail for 10 years I'd never tell.  Then when it all blew over or whatever, I'd spend that money.

I think there's a bit of fanaticism that blinds some of its proselytizers to some legitimate concerns about the model. 
I wouldn't want to get paid in bitcoins, and I wouldn't want to buy things with them either, and I think that's true of most people that have them, other than the people that have almost a de facto faith that it's going to "change the world" or whatever.

You could easily launder them though.  Take them out as currency, buy different coins back.  Now you can trace the coins but what's that get you?

But that's kind of my point.  The more people that get burned, the more people abandon the idea.  It's not about fixing me, it's about protecting you.  Anonymity protects the guilty as well as the innocent.

The problem is that individual people don't like being the ones to get fucked, so everyone else knows who not to trust.
That's fine for "the market."  It's not very fine for you, personally, if you lost a lot of money.

Case and point.

Yes but that's a huge problem, if only "bitcoin devotees" trust it.

Say I started an exchange.  Then I just stole all the coins.  Who puts me in jail, and how do you get them back?
