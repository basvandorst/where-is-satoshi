Bitcoin as an open source technology is similar to Linux, its in a state of perpetual optimization and redistribution. There are about 100000 types of Linux, some are worth billions (re: redhat sells to IBM) and some are worth what they're worth to the people who created them, and then all the value in between. (arm,raspi, debian in space, chromebooks, steamOS etc...) The difference with BTC and alt coins is their function is purely financial which solves a very real issue of real world value with the late stage of Fiat currencies (USD,AUD,EUR,GBP,JPY,CAD etc...) and the risk in holding them through financial turmoil and more people are asking the fundamental question "what is money?"
So I welcome everyone to attempt to optimize Bitcoin, but be ready to campaign to the node operators, github developers, and extended community. If your plan is truly beneficial then it will be adopted.

Also you realize that the term "flippening" is not a Bcash term. It started with the Eth bullrun.

If bitcoin had an unlimited, percent based inflation rate of its supply, it would be an inflationary currency like Fiat is. When fiat increases its money supply as it has done 1200% in my lifetime, it is inflation.

I tried to buy a pizza on Sunday. Declined. Banking system was down for 12 hours unscheduled maintenance.  
If the pizza place took BTC w/ Lightning I could have paid instantly. Instead I had to call the pizza place back and tell them I had to cancel my order.  
So they lost business that night because of legacy payment bs.

From the time I was born to the time I graduated, the dollar increased 2x. From the time I graduated until now (12 years) the dollar has increased another 6x with an imminent increase in inflation coming soon. I never signed up for this bullshit system that keeps wages the same but their spending power decreases year over year. I can however signup for bitcoin and I am not alone.

Just cus you believe something doesnt mean its going to come out that way. Ignoring this point is called Cognitive Dissonance and it leads people to all sorts of unhealthy conclusions.

Posts like this are cringe.  
99% of buys are not holders.  
The amount of time that BTC price has been above the current price is less than 5% of BTC's total lifespan.  
So lets stop acting like anyone who purchased in 2017 are victims because they long since made their profits.

It does add up. Bitcoin isnt a 0 sum game, where powerball is. In btc you can lose some value, but you never lose it all. Powerball, you often lose it all.

As someone whos considered doing a bike tour for crypto, there's a few things you have to consider.  
Lining up support along the way is important to sustain your progress, but you also have to think about publicity, are you going to video the tour, how many people are attending with you? What resources do you have to sustain you on your journey?  
You want to be well fed and happy and show everyone else that Bitcoiners can do a successful, well publicized tour. Wishing you all the best and interested to see more info as it comes out.
