Same thing happening over here.  blockchain.info won't even load half the time..  definitely issues abound.  And if you are lucky enough to login to your wallet, the "loading transactions" message in upper right just keeps spinning and the true balance in your wallet isn't properly reflected.

Never been audited in my life and have very little to hide.  I pay the US government way too much money for me to get audited.  I also wouldn't be stupid enough to report my actual losses in BTC in 2013 because they eclipsed $5K.  My only point is, it is walking into a hornets nest to report losses on a "loss" that has no guidance.  Of course the IRS will take your interest free money when they never even asked for it.  But it works both ways, and they WILL fuck you if it goes the other way.

Yes I am aware but that really wasn't the point.  This article that explains why you SHOULD report bitcoin income, is the exact reason why you SHOULDN'T because if you report bitcoin LOSSES, you WILL BE AUDITED.

You will never get audited until 9-12 months after you file.  It's a computer that scans your electronic filing and it takes around a year before the IRS gets around to flagging any irregularities.  The electronic acceptance only looks for blatant mathematical errors.  They don't even do the comparison between what you filed and what various forms were filed to the IRS.  That takes time.  You will likely be audited for filing questionable losses, none of which were reported to the IRS.  I'm not saying your losses aren't valid, but it is premature.  Write back here in about a year when you get the letter in the mail.
