No problem! It’s my duty.
Now I have plan to create another model learned with BTCUSD ticker input data.
So do you have any idea about BTCUSD public ticker API?

Thanks for your replying!
Now I rewrite README more concretely!

Hi vexcoin.
I'm sorry to be late. Now I answer to your questions.
create_csv.py continues fetching ticker values unless you stop it.
So you need to stop runnning of create_csv.py with CTRL+C.
I recommend you to keep fetching ticker values for 4 or 5 days. Thus, in the meantime, you need to confirm create_csv.py running without error.


Can you give me error message displayed on your screen?
I need more information about your error.
Rising/falling boolean values are whether ticker values will go up or down from the last input data.
For instance, you have input data which is 41 sets of ticker values per 1 minute like 10:50AM ~ 11:30AM. If you predict values with the data, you will gain predicted values which would be gained at 11:40AM.
If predicted values show rising (predicted values - last input values &gt; 0), predict_rising_from() returns True and predict_falling_from returns False (just opposite values).
If you want to predict constantly, you need to make script to do so.
If I have more time, I would build it with python3, and conbine laplace with it!

So sorry for my ambitious explanation.
This predicts “sell”, “buy”, “last”, and “vol” values of Bitcoin ticker!

I updated README now.
How about it?
