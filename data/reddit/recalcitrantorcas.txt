Did you use Bitcoin Foundation money to charter jets for yourself Bruce? 
Bruce [flying high](
After all the egregious waste that your foundation has been accused of it's name is forever tarnished. The fact that you still stick up for it and don't move on seems like a real risk that you are taking, I don't know how your reputation can stand it.

The foundation is a joke and should be disbanded. Your reputation falls every single day you remain a part of it. It's time to move on Bruce.

Who do you mean when you say everyone else? If 51% of nodes run an implementation that relays less than or equal to block size 1.25MB would that not work?

Why, how exactly? 
Right now there is just a line of code saying, "don't relay blocks greater than 1MB" Why can't someone change it to 1.25MB, hit Ctrl-Save and keep running the node or keep mining? 
Individually, wouldn't this be inconsequential? If no one else does it you lose nothing. If other people start doing it, you gain 25% capacity. 
Some people might do 1.1MB, others might do 1.5MB, but soon everyone will realize that we need to settle on an exact number...someone puts up a website showing the different values, and people just naturally change their node or miner to the most popular one they are OK with. 
I can't understand why this wouldn't work...

This was the kind of response I was interested in when I posted this question. Thanks. I can't figure out why more people are not replying to the actual question! Like what are the practical and unique steps Satoshi would have to take? 
I feel like there is potential to disprove perfect bitcoin anonymity here.

How did you word the emails? That might be helpful to others (including me).
