Greed will make this a very successful non-controversial event ;)

It's much less entropy than a 12 words password since BIP39 words are drawn from a list of 2048.

The whole value proposition of Bitcoin is based on it being impossible to guess a given private key. If in the future this becomes possible Bitcoin will implement changes on its cryptography. So lost coins are effectively lost.
@_date: 2016-04-29 13:27:06
As long as wallets implement BIP44 + BIP39 (and most wallets already implement this) we don't need them to have a standard API. The fact that you can use your 12/24 words to recreate your private key and use it to derive all your addresses should make it simple enough to migrate to a different provider.

How is he exaggerating? It probably would have cost you $15 in fees to send $1. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 03:26:30
I'm aware that fees will eventually and gradually replace the reward. But there is no need for fees to raise, instead there could be more transactions paying small fees. Anyways, this is supposed to be a smooth transition. Why is core trying to innecessarily and prematurely force things? What is the purpose of disrupting this balance?

I don't know about a relative cap... don't you think a cap based on Nielsen's law or some other external estimation of resource growth would be safer?
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:15:57
You are right, I missed that part of his post. Thanks.

Keeping the block limit at 1MB as blocks get full *IS* the change. Increasing the max block size would allow Bitcoin to keep working as it has for the past 6 years.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:29:00
The key point here is a decoupling of running a node to support the network vs. running a node as a wallet to hold coins. People who choose to run a node nowadays have only one goal in mind and that is to support the network so they are not going to drop it if block size is increased.

To unlock your funds, just remove the tx proposal using the creator copayer. No funds are lost as long as you keep 2 out of the 3 backups.
@_date: 2015-06-28 13:13:53
Does that mean 100% of exchanges need to switch to the new chain? No... &gt;50% would be fine

This is the reason why only big players can be profitable in the remittance market. With Bitcoin you don't need to be on both ends of the transaction and you don't need to batch your transfers. This allows for small startup to be serious competition for WU. Truly disruptive!

The keys never leave your device. Transactions are signed on the client.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:41:28
Technically it does have an effect on the supply rate as it takes longer to mine blocks until the difficulty adjusts 
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:55:50
How long do you think it would take us to rebuy those devalued coins?
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:07:36
Confidence in Bitcoin is not based on the actions of a single person. This is the whole point of a decentralized currency. As long as the technology is solid Bitcoin's value is intact.

Ok then,  are you following his advice and staying away from bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:52:45
Maybe on bitcoin side it could say 0.01*

Can't he just put a ton of his own coins in escrow? Let's say the escrow is 90% Garza's coins. Now he only has to pay min of $10,000 a month while he benefits from removing lots of coins from the market?
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:01:25
Yes but they would also need to control 50% of all mining power
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:05:13
I think he was implying that such a change would not be accepted by the majority of the network
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:34:04
It will start declining long before mining is over. The rate of lost coins will probably be higher than what is mined for the last 80 or so years of mining...
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:13:16
Right, people can choose to stay but they will be transacting in an insecure network. Would you trust the coin in such scenario?

Copay works on all platforms and has an option to swipe from paper wallets.

Are they all planning to quit if there is a hard fork to 2MB?
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:17:22
This is a false dichotomy. Either hire a core dev or stfu when they act against the interest of Bitcoin and the community? 
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:26:02
Take a look at 
It even supports air-gapped signing of txs.
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:53:29
I think you mean 66.7%
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:51:47
Yes, just write down your 12 words seed and store it in a secure place. For a 2-of-2 wallet, write down both seeds. This is a standard backup method so you can easily recover using many tools including

I don't think the number of nodes has been decreasing based on the size of the blockchain or bandwidth requirements. I think wallet alternatives have a lot to do with this. There will always be a percentage of users willing to contribute to the network (either for selfish or altruistic reasons). If the user base grows by 50x, even if the percentage of users running a node decreases, my intuition is that the absolute number of nodes would still grow. This is just my own view on the matter, I don't claim to be right.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:41:17
No. This is not science, this is engineering. Compromising is not only possible but an absolute necessity.

The wallet needs to protect against RBF double spends.
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:21:40
Probably more than we have today as it would mean 50 times more activity/users.
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:27:07
I guess if there is money to be made by mining txs at lower fees, this opens up the mining market for competitors.

Why do we need a central planner? If Aethereum is not interesting to people in this sub, it will get downvoted. Just stop playing big brother.

More importantly: if Bitcoin scales, BlockStream dies.

Correction: the seed used to generate the master extended private key from where all addresses in the wallet are derived.

Take a look at all the progress being done on alternative clients re thin blocks. They reduce bandwidth requirements by orders of magnitude.
