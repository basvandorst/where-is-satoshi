Boy, has this place changed over the past year. I would have never thought I'd see a comment like yours in the positives.. I'm glad people are finally coming to their senses

You glossed over my point about insurance. As a consumer and credit-card owner, I feel confident using it online because all major credit card issuers will refund any losses due to fraud. BTC is still vulnerable to fraud or technical difficulties, but there is no way to recover the lost money. Again: the vast majority of people buying BTC aren't speculating right now and are in it for the convenience.

It seems like people in exaggerate the inflationary effects on the USD as much as they tend to ignore the problems with the deflationary pressures on BTC :P

I think he means selling off 10% after each doubling. He should sell more rapidly than that, because it probably won't double again.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:41:58
Doesn't it bother you guys that such a relatively small order has such a great impact on the BTC price?
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:46:29
But people who hold Bitcoin for its use value don't care about the time and energy invested in the project as much as they care about being able to spend their cryptocurrency. A better argument would be that the network effect would allow Bitcoin to have a virtual monopoly as other competitors are unable to break into the same space (Paypal would be a good example), but at the moment, there are not that many vendors that accept Bitcoin; hence the 'market' for cryptocurrency is still competitive.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:24:49
Or rather, avoid deflation. The cumulative inflation between 1929 and today is only 1265.8% despite all that printing. How much do **you** think $1000 USD will be worth in 20 years?
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:00:04
Hahaha ridiculous. Everyone knows European Renminbi is the way to go.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:08:25
Well, if I were to lock down $100 which I could use to speculate on something else which would yield me more, more quickly, that seems like an OC.

[Like this?](
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:56:47


Is an extreme overstatement. The Napster analogy makes more sense here. Also don't forget that, while its usability has been increasing, it's not very easy to exchange Bitcoins atm, and there aren't that many (online) vendors who do accept the currency. I can easily see another competitor taking its place in the near future.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:29:05
Or MBTC...
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:43:45
That 3% covers the costs of fraud. It's not a perfect system, I agree, and I would even go so far as to say that BTC offers an interesting (but severely flawed) model which might shake things up in terms of online transactions in the long term. Right now, however, BTC is still overwhelmingly bought for speculative purposes, and the deflationary properties of BTC all but ensure that this will continue to be the case in the future. As much as people in talk about the new paradigm and the transactional value of BTC, the reality is unfortunately still that it remains a speculative investment.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:52:11
One of the most interesting features of BTC I know of. But using BTC for the bet means you win regardless: if I am right and the price goes down immensely, I win next to nothing or lose money, whereas if the price really does go beyond $10K, you win a lot. Is there a similar mechanism for other currencies?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:07:11
will yield a little bit less biased discussion and some interesting critical articles.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:53:54
Yeah it does seem very predatory. I prefer making money off strangers as well. Shame the next election is so far off, not enough interesting markets on the horizon yet to warrant an activation. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:58:15
Try to not be so aggressive and close-minded next time, and read up on some alternative interpretations of value, and you might actually learn something. [This would be a good starting point]( 
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:25:32
I am not EnzoValenzetti, and I guess I agree with you that it wouldn't necessarily ruin his life, but I do agree that his projection is extremely bullish, and will lead to disappointment. 
If he actually counts on Bitcoin value to double every 6 months, and adjusts his consumption patterns, career choices, and investments accordingly, he could end up getting hurt financially. Certainly wouldn't be the first time someone gets caught up in a frenzy that ends with nothing but broken dreams and an empty bank account...
Rational reasons for assuming that the Bitcoin value won't double every six months? Well, I think it's clear looking at recent price changes that the surge in value isn't going to continue indefinitely in the short run. There was a similar price surge not too long ago that resulted in a collapse, and then a steady rise again. 
It's hard to assess the true 'value' of Bitcoin, as, unlike stocks, there is no profit or revenue, or capital to use as a base to calculate. Unlike other currency, there is also no country's economy with exports, imports, and a central bank to be able to predict currency prices. 
However, the information we do have is the amount of people using Bitcoin for purposes other than speculation, the depth of the market, and the technical limitations. Right now, the speculative value far exceeds the actual use value, indicating an overvaluation. Further, the market is pretty shallow, as large purchases or sales of Bitcoin result in big fluctuations; this could lead to shock waves one way or the other, indicating a fragile commodity. Finally, the technical limitations: it is very hard right now to exchange Bitcoins to dollars, as the Bitcoin economy is completely reliant on means of exchange wholly unprepared for the kind of expansion in trading that has occurred the past couple of months. When people are unable to trade their commodities, this places a serious limitation on their future value, and might make speculators uneasy when they realize it is difficult to sell when they need to, causing a 'bank run'.
Of course, this is all speculation, but to me, these combined factors scream 'BUBBLE'. Also, don't forget that, even though the market for digital, decentralized coins could well grow exponentially in the future, a more stable coin could replace Bitcoin at any moment. The assumption that Bitcoin will be the only possible commodity to fill this space is a very dangerous one I see a lot around here. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:41:04
Yes, I agree. The USD as the global currency is a very important hedge against hyperinflation. However, the proposition that USD would cease to be the global reserve currency within the next 20 years is, again, an extremely unlikely scenario.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:45:49
Do you really think credit card transactions are more vulnerable to fraud than BTC transactions? At least with credit cards, you are insured against most exploitation. I think you are deluding yourself if you think that the vast majority of people buying BTC aren't speculating right now and are in it for the convenience.
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:24:45
Wow, thanks! If you keep that up, you just might change my mind ;)
I agree with you, though. The amount of ridiculous comments on both sides of the spectrum are astounding. I'm still learning about Bitcoin and its intricacies, so I might be wrong on a number of points, but I am also excited about its world-changing potential. I just think people should be careful not to get carried away at this point. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:48:18
$53.70.. Not exactly worth the 84 year wait. People are really exaggerating dollar inflation (about 3.14% average over that period) in here. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:05:06
True, but the further in advance you do it, the higher the opportunity cost, aside from the information cost.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:36:08
That's why I love US elections. I also made a similar amount in that way betting with true believers on both sides, but I bet it would be so easy to make shitloads of money off arbitrage if you lived in, say Ohio close to campaign HQs of Romney and Obama. The primaries were also a great opportunity for this, it's a real shame that Intrade died.
@_date: 2013-09-03 23:39:21
Well is it really that likely that Satoshi was/is a single person? I thought most people agreed that it was probably a collective.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:58:44
Hmm.. That might actually work somehow, although I'm not even sure that BTC will still be $1k by that time (I know it's dangerous being a bear on but I think you need them around here). On the other hand, if BTC reaches $9000 by the agreed date, I win big. It is very confusing...
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:32:30


There will most definitely be a dip, and I am expecting a significant one. BTC is still insanely volatile, and while I don't expect a completely devastating crash any time soon, the price will drop soon and fast. Don't just follow it is an incredibly bullish circlejerk which will make you invest emotionally and not rationally. Do some independent research and keep an eye on skeptical sources as well before you blow your money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:46:31
Wanna bet?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:37:31
I'd take you up on that bet if there was some sort of mechanism to ensure that neither of us could back out. Also, the end of 2014 is too far away to lock down any significant amount.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:02:46
No, not necessarily. I simply mean that PayPal sets up this currency, separately from their main business, and then allow PPCoins to be deposited into your PayPal account and converted to other currencies, just like Euros, Dollars, etc. can all be deposited into a PayPal account (but BitCoins (currently?) cannot).  The X-rate for the currency could still be determined by the demand for PPCoins, but it would increase its usability. 
PayPal benefits by charging a minor conversion fee, and by not having to compete with Bitcoins, and the coin itself can be used outside in much the same way that Bitcoins are now. 
The consumer benefits for all the same reasons that they benefit from Bitcoins now, plus the increased stability of the platforms on which the cryptocurrency relies, and the additional ease with which they can convert it into other currencies or buy things directly through their PayPal wallet. 
However, the idealists within the Bitcoin community would probably see this as a perversion of the original idea, as it would be less decentralized. Nonetheless, it's all about mainstream adoption, so the more I think about it, the more likely it seems that some corporation (PayPal or anyone else) will snap this up and use it for profit now that BitCoin has demonstrated its potential...
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:16:28
Sarcasm or not, you're still not adding to the conversation, so your comment is about as worthless as the one you replied to.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:47:12
In the long run, USD as a reserve currency is untenable, and I hope that global monetary system reforms take off soon rather than after another global monetary crisis, but it's still a long way off. Even China has been very slow in terms of diversification of its holdings. If you have any evidence to the contrary, I would be very interested in reading up about it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:50:47
Great advice, but it sounds like he will learn through experience. Calling people IDIOTS because they don't trust their gut feelings seems to indicate an unwillingness to step back and have an objective look at the market.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:53:57
I'd still rather have some bitcoin tips
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:53:42
I've been thinking that a more likely producer of a new Bitcoin would be a company like PayPal. It's founded by someone who is now a libertarian billionaire, with many of the same ideals that inspire those who are so excited about Bitcoin. 
They have a whole team of programmers, marketers, a bunch of servers, and, most importantly, they have an entire network of widely adopted online wallets. If they created a stable cryptocurrency that could be used outside of PayPal, but also be redeemed through PayPal, they would instantly eclipse Bitcoin in terms of its usability and (perceived) reliability. 
Am I missing something, or does this sound like a plausible scenario?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:17:02
Alright, but that doesn't mean it is likely or probable that it will take place in the USA. Hyperinflation requires some very specific preconditions that have not set in in that country, and are unlikely to take place in the coming decades.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:56:49
Ha, you never know here. Shame, I was feeling lucky.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:12:13
Well it might not work next time around, but in late 2012 both sides has correctly identified that whoever wins Ohio, wins the election. They had both set up shop throughout the state trying to win souls and both sides had internal polling which exaggerated their perception of the probability of their candidate winning. 
So what I would have done is get friendly with people on both campaigns by acting like someone interested in politics but unsure who to vote for, then hinting that Obama/Romney didn't really stand a chance and that I admired their persistence despite the fact that the odds were against their candidate.
If the true believers then tried to convince me that they were very sure that their candidate would win (which somehow both sides were), I would offer the best possible odds in simultaneous bets which would offer me the greatest arbitrage. 
This is how arbitrage worked on the online election betting markets at that time:




You can see that there is already a very large return with those online betting markets, where the price is determined mostly by rational bettors who have instant access to all betting information. Even if they believe they are getting great odds, they will be reluctant to put their money somewhere when they can find out that they can get an even higher return at a different betting market. For this reason, the arbitrage edge quickly disappears in this realm.
Making bets face-to-face with emotionally invested supporters on both sides offers a much greater risk-free earning potential since these campaigners not only believe they are making money - they are trying to prove how much they believe in their candidate, and they won't compare their bets to the actual odds offered on online betting markets since they are not gamblers, but political supporters.
So if you managed to get better than even odds against both candidates at the same time, you win no matter who wins the election.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:56:24
Sure, but it does give you a reasonable indicator. The probability of hyperinflation of the USD is extremely low, especially since it has never occurred before. Of course the USD could be dead in 20 years, but this is again extremely unlikely. It is an extraordinary claim that really requires some evidence, or at least reasoning.
