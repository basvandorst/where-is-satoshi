In Greece every 2 years they ask for all your tax stuff again to make sure its all updated... They don't block money... They just don't let you spend it until you send them the new info...

Generally there is no black or white  in opinions and people... That duality in USA politics will be their downfall...
There are "Conservatives" in the Democrats and "Liberals" in the republican parties... 
In Other Countries there are 5-6 parties that keep check on each other...

The refugee trick  is very popular in Greece ... Because of all the Illegal Immigrants from Syria and "Turkey"  It take 2-5 years to get the trial... so they use it as a delay trick (he will lose)
