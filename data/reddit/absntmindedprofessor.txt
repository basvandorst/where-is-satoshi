As Christopher Hitchens said, claims offered without evidence can be refuted without evidence.
"You're Satoshi Nakamoto!"
"No I'm not."

Uhm, no.  Let's say one year ago you spent $1200 on a rig with 3x 7950's which would get you a hash rate of 1600 MH/sec.  Since then you would have mined 63 BTC, which is a nice return on your investment.
Unfortunately, with the same money you could have bought 93 BTC.

If you had simply bought and held those 75 BTC, they would be worth $5250 today.

Umm... not really.  I checked my spreadsheet and I haven't updatated the difficulty numbers since July, but that doesn't make a huge difference since a small setup wouldn't have mined much since then anyway.


Yes, with your example you could have mined around 250 BTC in the last year.  However with the same $5k you could have purchased around 400 BTC (price was about $12 then).


A few responses to that.  First, you need free electricity.  Second, you have to assume that none of your hardware will fail, despite running as hard as possible for 2 years continuously.  Not likely, IMO.
But even ignoring that, if you had started mining in 10/11 you would have about 50% more BTC compared to purchasing.  However this was at the tail end of the 2011 price bubble.  If you waited until the end of that October to make your purchase, you would have a similar amount for mining vs. purchasing.
