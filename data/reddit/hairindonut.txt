After a few test I can be even more specific.
The problem occurs when the wallet on the OFFLINE PC is not a "standard" wallet from Electrum. 
If the wallet on the OFFLINE PC is created as a new wallet by using the "import private keys" feature -&gt; SIGN button is does not show
If the wallet  on the OFFLINE PC is not created by importing private keys but for example the existing wallet file is just transferred to and opened on the OFFLINE PC -&gt; SIGN button does show and transaction can be signed
Unfortunately if one is using another wallet software such as Bitcoin Core primarily and only wants to use Electrum on Tails for the offline signing, the bug I'm writing about prevents this.

I tried this a couple of time. Both with the transaction itself being made on the latest 3.0.2 and 2.7.9 version of Electrum. 
In both cases the sign button is just missing. 
Were you online or offline? 
How did you create the wallet on the 2.7.9 Electrum machine?

Yeah the developers on the mail list I linked in the topic are discussing something along these lines, but I don't really understand it.

What version are you using on the online PC?
Can you try this guide and see if that works for you or check if that's what you are doing anyway?

Can you confirm that on the OFFLINE TAILS PC, you aren't creating the wallet by importing private keys but by opening a wallet file which you transfer to the TAILS PC or which is stored in Persistence?

Yes you can run it, but when you try to sign a transaction, the SIGN button is not there. Not even greyed out or so, just not there. (see my longer description and more reasons to update Electrum in my top post)

Which version of Tails and Electrum are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:37:10
Same as me. So you load the unsigned transaction in Electrum, and you can press the sign button? For me the sign button just isn't there.

For anyone wondering, the process of "air-gapped offline signing" with Electrum and Tails is described here: 
In my oppinion it is a very safe way to create an transaction from an Bitcoin Core wallet or a paper wallet. 
A lot of people think about how to store their BTC safely, but getting them out of storage is also risk. This method seems to avoid quite some risk. 
Unfortunately the Electrum version 2.7.9. has a bug in it which prevents you from signing the transmission on the offline PC in Tails. AFAIK it's actually two bugs, one is that you have to start it in --offline mode. The other is that the "Sign" button just doesn't show up once you load the transaction.
Obviously one can download the latest version of Electrum but that requires you to go to one more source online and download another piece of software which isn't part of Electrum and therefore can't be trusted (of course you can check the signature but still..)
The Electrum devs are apparently too busy with other issues and don't think this feature is important (can't blame em). Bug report here: 
Besides the bug, the version in Tails is also pretty old and doesn't support Segwit and other nice things. So it's also not great for the users who want to use it as a normal anonymous wallet.
**If anyone who has the necessary linux magic developer skills could help the Tails guys out, you'd be doing this community a great favour.**

Interesting, does that work permanently or would I have to redo those steps every time?
But in general it would of course be better if this was bundled in Tails since it would leave less room for error (when checking the integrity of the download for example)

Can someone create a deepfake with her?
