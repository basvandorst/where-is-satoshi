LOL. I stopped reading there. You're either a government agent from Venezuela or retarded (or both).

Well done. I'm in my fourties, did something similiar 5 years ago and could already retire today thanks to Bitcoin. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:17:35
Zero. Don‘t leave bitcoins on exchanges.

 Get one now. Turn on passphrase. Write down the seed at least 3 times and hide it in 3 different places.

I think he's a shill for some irrelevant altcoin.

He's CEO of the scam site bitcoin dot com

That was GameKyuubi's girlfriend. I wouldn't mess around with her!

I do so indeed. It makes hodling easier on hard days.

Hi, I am Ferdinand Hodler and I approve of this post.

No, look again. It's 2013.

Hello. I am Ferdinand Hodler. Ask me anything!
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:39:06
No, and I have no idea who that is. But I will google him!
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:16:10
Don't trust fake Ferdinand! I am the real one!
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:37:59
I‘m not saying the number, but I could easily sit on a beach and slurp Margaritas for the next few decades. But then I‘d have to spend bitcoins and I prefer to HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:06:07
I'll be HODLING like GameKyuubi!

Yeah, it will take a few more years for Bitcoin to become more stable and usable. Which is bad for people in Iran, because the Trump administration wants to mess with the country.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:54:24
It's about fucking time. But implementing Bcash first was so much more important to you.
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:17:10
I agree. Bcash SV is the real Bcash. Bcash ABC is a Chinese centralized coin (with Proof of Ver as consensus algorithm).
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:20:06
Yeah, I believe you. I'm sorry you have to experience this. And sorry I was posting misconceptions about your country. Are people getting into Bitcoin in Iran, do they see it as an alternative to Fiat or Gold?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:10:41
Thanks, I am glad you like my painting!

Breadwallet was perfect for giving newcomers their first Bitcoin. It was simple and easy and used the "bits" denomination - ideal for newbies' first small amounts of Bitcoin. Nowadays, if I would install the BRD wallet on a friend's phone, I would have to explain to stay away from the BCH scam, I'd have to explain BRD and ERC-20 tokens,  Ethereum etc. BRD is a Frankenstein wallet, and I don't like it. I wish the old Breadwallet was still available.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:10:48
It is indeed.

Two con men fighting over which fake Bitcoin is the real fake Bitcoin.

Yeah, you're right

BBC's reporting is accurate. The Iranian government is arresting and killing gold traders because it wants to send a message to the people of Iran: Use our fiat money, don't hoard goald.
What would you do if you lived in a country where the currency's value will go to shit because of sanctions and a SWIFT blockade? You'd try to hoard Gold (or Bitcoin), too, and you'd probably do it using your network and something the government calls a "black market" - because it wants to keep people from buying gold.
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:13:49
It also has full scam coin (BCH) support. So it's a no-go for me.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:04:22
It's possible that someone installed a keylogger on your PC and has remote access to it. Don't use McAffee, it's crap. Use Malwarebytes instead. Set up a virtual machine or reinstall your OS. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:29:45
You're welcome. If it were not so sad and dangerous it would be hilarious how crappy McAfee is.

I love Douglas Adams, but: I'm 48 years old and totally disagree with this! :D
Also: I'm pretty sure I have more BTC than those 25-34 year old whippersnappers! :P

Okay, maybe I'm wrong. Do you live there or have relatives there?

Roger Ver is a con man and bitcoin dot com is a scam site.

Oh, I get it now...  It’s inspired by „De sterrennacht“ from Vincent himself. I didn‘t know that one yet.

There is a Tesla taxi driving around in Vienna, too. Next time I see it, I'll ask the driver if he accepts Bitcoin.

Have you heard of the internet? It‘s a stack of more than 400 protocols on top of each other. TCP, IP, POP, SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent etc. etc. Guess what, that‘s how you scale networks. What the Core developers are doing is correct. Lightning is a protocol layer on top of the Bitcoin blockcahin, and many more layers will follow.

LOL, "threatened"... by a shitcoin scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:33:54
Everyone can run a Lightning node.  Lightning is a network of smart contracts, it does not have a single point of failure or a centre, it's completely decentralized. A Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, Lightning uses Bitcoin's nlock time and multisig functionality. 
The story about BTC "keeping fees high" is a lie, too. In fact it was Roger Ver and his gang who spammed the Bitcoin network to drive up the fees.
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:07:15
Looks van Gogh-ish. I like it!
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:23:57
For small amounts such as coffee or a taxi fare it's okay to just wait until the transaction is broadcast - which usually takes a second or two and is visible in a smartphone wallet right away. I would wait for 1 confirmation when selling a used computer, and for 8 confirmations when selling a car or house. (Furthermore, Lightning is coming. Maybe that driver has an Eclair wallet installed already.)
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:54:42
Take a look at Paycoin.
