Thats very true. Specially now in the bear market, all the shitcoin projects are abandoned by their community. The remaining ones see bitcoin community as their target to spread their scammy agenda, as bitcoin community is still strong and innovating. They are doing their best to attack bitcoin, hoping their bags would pump.
Bitcoin community is not weak, we been here since 2011 and we will be here. Vision of decentralisation is still strong. It makes a lot more sense to become a bitcoin maximalist than ever before.
Bitcoin developers, thank you for staying strong and sticking to the original cypherpunk vision. We love you.

I don't know what you are getting at. You want to pay tax for US to attack and you totally understand why they attack. My point was So why not stop all these useless attacks and serve the citizens?

think about it. or read the whole thing.

I am not an American and I do not follow the American politics. From what I understand, he wants to give free education and free health care. There are many countries with free health care and free education and they are working just fine. United States spends all the raised tax money on War and army. If United states is not on war constantly then they can use this money on health care and education.

Why do you pay tax? If they collect tax, they should provide some thing out of it, not just bomb other country to get oil companies and war complex to get rich from tax money. I am not a big fan of paying tax but where I live we don't pay for health, I have never paid anything for health related stuff. Education here is almost free.. Our social system is good, you don't see homeless people like in the states. Public infrastructure are not falling apart like the US.   
May be I am an economy illiterate but I see where the money is going when I pay tax. What is your justification for your country to spend tax money on war and not on the citizens. On top of that, when some guy says lets spend that money into something good like health and education, you blame him for not being economica...l lol

Stockholm syndrom. No one is going to come to attack US. its the other way round US attacks everyone with recourses.

@_date: 2019-05-14 05:18:36
No one actually knows whats going on. It's bitcoin doing its thing like it always does.
