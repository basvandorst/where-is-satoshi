This FUD they're trying to spread is working in reverse. I can smell the establishment's fear. It smells delicious.
I'll HODL till the end.

Probably just another whale controlled bot spreading fud to manipulate prices

The bitter end. Zero. The highly unlikely scenario where btc crashes down to worthlessness and every miner and user leaves the network.
I  don't consider myself an investor by any means. The reason I'm in this is because I hate the international banking cartel with every cell of my body. Their unchecked power is funded by the lie of Fiat and fractional banking and it sucks how they always been this indestructible power structure.
But BTC provided the means for the people of the world to get rid from these parasites for the first time in history. Or at least try to.
That's why my loyalty lies with bitcoin/crypto and yes, I'm willing to lose all the fiat I spent buying my coins just to get a shot at helping this idea become reality. Even a total crash means that we at least tried to fight back.

Word on the street is that Gavin Belson, another prominent sillicon valley figure, is also a believer

Let's just not forget the market is UTTERLY irrational. This sounds like bullish news , but for the market it may not matter at all

Must read theory on this topic. 
The author implies that the BTC could be analyzed through the lens of Gartner Hype Cycles. Y'all should read it. He implies that BTC's value could potentially be following a tech adoption curve rather than a price fluctuation curve.
