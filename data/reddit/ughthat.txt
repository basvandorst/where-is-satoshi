I think you meant to say "no one has made money blindly speculating on the Bitcoin exchange rate." There are plenty of people making money with bitcoin.

Worked like a charm for me. Granted it was a very small order (under $100). Placed the order just before the holidays and received it on 12/31.

I am not saying they would turn it down. I am saying that the the claim the original comment made is ridiculous. The Senate wouldn't orchestrate this whole circus just to give the DOJ a few extra million.
I understand it has nothing to do with the national debt directly. I mentioned the national dept to illustrate how ridiculous it is to thing that the Senate would go through all this trouble for a small amount of money. If anything it is financial institutions and private money that has a lot to gain from this.

Well, it's a bit of a rabbit hole. Why is the metal worth $0.08? Only because someone else feels that this is the value and is willing to pay you for it. The metal (like anything else in the wold) is inherently valueless until you find someone who is willing to give you something for it.

Not true with increased difficulty. You should run your numbers through one of the mining calculators. Here is what I came up with: 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:27:02
The government doesn't care. The seized coins are peanuts, even if the price skyrockets. Even if the seized coins were suddenly worth $1 billion, they would only be roughly 0.005816659% of our national debt. It would also only be about 40% of the amount our national debt increases every single day. It's much more likely that there are individuals or companies with influence behind this.

Pretty cool! Will you be able to send as well?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:07:46
First, the $1 billion I threw out was hypothetical to illustrate how absurd the claim is. Considering the seized coins are currently (at $600/btc) worth about $86 million the bitcoin exchange rate would have to go to just about $7000/btc (up 1400%) for the coins to be worth a billion. At the current exchange rate the seized coins make up around 1% of the budget number you threw out.
Second, the seized coins do not go to the FBI. Asset forfeitures for FBI, DEA and the ATF go to the DOJ which has a budget of around $27 billion. The coins also would't just get added to their balance sheet as there are very strict guidelines what the money can be used for (mostly drug enforcement on the local level).

I think that depends on the timeframe of the screen you are looking at. Short term (multi week) is definitely trending down.

Undervalued based on what exactly? BTC is not backed by any securities, so the real value is by definition the market price. You can say that you feel that the value will increase from here, but that's really just an opinion. Whereas saying it is undervalued implies that your statement is based on basic economic principles, which it is not.
Just to be clear. I am not saying buying and holding BTC is a bad idea.

Looks great, but I agree with the comment. 
I'd consider using a cubemap that either reflects a representation of what the room looks like or use some other dark pattern. I'd also think about pulling back on the reflectiveness since real coins are never that shiny. You should also consider adding some very subtle bumpmaps because real coins are not really that smooth. Here is an example of what I am talking about in terms of shininess and texture:

Sure, that makes sense for local banking. My comment was more that Cyprus isn't going to be very attractive to foreigners because of it's instability. Cyprus being a EU member state doesn't help much either.

You are technically correct. But why is the face value of the quarter in your example $0.25? It's because the issuer made that guarantee. The quarter itself is theoretically only worth the cost of the raw material.

This was a great read, thank you. But I do t fully agree with your reasoning on why bitcoin is a hard currency. It certainly has aspects of hard currency, such as the irreversible nature of transactions as you point out. But I think the argument that math is the underplaying resource falls flat (unless I am misunderstanding). With gold, silver, etc you have a raw material that has alternative value through alternative uses in medicine and manufacturing for example. You can't really say the same thing about bitcoin. Once the computational power to calculate a hash has been spent it is gone. You can't reclaim the SAME computational power for an alternative use.

Just keep in mind that it doesn't have to be a zero sum game. What a lot of investors would do in that situation is take at least some of the chips off the table. If you at least cash out your initial investment you are playing 100% with the bank's money. A lot of traditional investors would cash out enough to keep their portfolio balanced (e.g. enough so that the % in high risk assets is not over 10%). Personally I would also take some of my gains and make small investments in other high risk assets. Basically how vcs works.
Edit: keep in mind that the tax difference for holding the assets long term is only around 10-15%. With the kind of volatility we've seen that very quickly becomes a non factor. 
Edit: spelling

If its only for receiving why do you have to deal with the private keys at all? If the main goal is to accept payments it could be cool if you can just enter your address(es) and display the QR code to accept payments for a POS. Then you could plug into the blockchain.info api to retrieve confirmations, etc and display which ones have cleared and which ones are pending. Just an idea =)

That is just a terrible idea. Any dealer I know would tack the CC fees onto the purchase price. I've always been able to negotiate better rates by not paying with a CC.

If you use something obscure you should have more protection than with plain English. I am talking Swiss German (which doesn't even have official spelling rules) or a dialect in a different language. Obviously you should know the language at least a little or it would be much harder to memorize.

Thats a great idea. I'd probably have a hard time fitting it on the transaction screen without cluttering it up too much, but I could show a preview of the note. And if you click on the preview the whole message could pop up.

I don't know how many people pay for a $90k car with a CC, but I am guessing not too many. And I think that if Tesla were to accept BTC it would come off mostly as a marketing gimmick to the general public. What is their upside?
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:01:58
Conceptually you are right. But the "meat space" is far from anonymous. As long as I know who the seller is it will in theory always be possible to connect the dots. The only truly anonymous way to acquire bitcoins is through mining them yourself.
@_date: 2013-07-19 21:33:13


Considering they can't pay wages, materials, etc in BTC they will still need to convert it to USD at some point and deal with a bank.


See issue above. In many ways BTC is less "instant" than other transactions in this case. If the car is financed then Tesla still gets their cash instantly. If it is paid in full the car is not delivered until full payment has cleared. Either way, this isn't really an issue. Especially not in a company that has a healthy cashflow.


True, although they will still pay fees to process payroll, etc (see above).  Transaction fees are negligible. A $10 wire transfer fee on a $90k car is 0.011%. 


Illegal. Nuff said.

How would a bank statement help? It was supposed to be an in-person transaction, which implies it would have been in cash. There is no way for the bank to know if he got the money or not.

I think there are several financial outfits that have taken on bitcoin positions as a hedge. The regulatory aspect you mentioned would definitely be a huge benefit to banks, but I think even at a lower scale hedge funds, etc stand to make a lot of profit off of these hearings.

I guess I could track any address that is added to the app, but even if I did it would be pretty difficult to connect it to a specific user. 
The app doesn't track your GPS location. Most features that have to do with privacy are locked down by apple, and you should get a popup asking for your permission if any app tries to get your location, access your contacts, etc.

Totally agree with you. It's no absolute security. But it should en large be better than English because that is most likely the default dictionary most hackers would try first. So even if they did the research and figured out the language you should be off no worse than if you picked English words.

@_date: 2013-11-04 17:11:01
The difference is actually very important. While it is true that all of the bullets you listed relay on logic/mathematics you also need to keep in mind that you can't take the login/math out of a mined bitcoin and use it elsewhere. Once the computational power has been spent on mining it is gone (only way to "convert" it back is through buying computation through the bitcoins purchasing power, which is not tangible value). What this means is that the "math" and "logic" you put into bitcoins is in reality a cost (or more specifically an "opportunity cost":  
You are making a choice to apply the math and logic to bitcoin rather than spending it on any of the bullets you listed above.
