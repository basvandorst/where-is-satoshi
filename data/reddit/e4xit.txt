Yes but I was replying to this parent comment (above):










In this case I didn't own the BTC originally, so the penalty tx will send "my" funds back to the exchange, as they own the private key.
@_date: 2016-04-03 10:47:21
Be that as it may, or not be that as it may, it's not a Ponzi scheme. Any way you look at it, it doesn't qualify. By saying it does you are only highlighting either your lack of understanding of Bitcoin, or your lack of understanding of Ponzi schemes.

Where is that from? I am sure I remember seeing Christian Decker say he was limiting lightning payments to $4 value at one point but could then never find the comment again. Would like to know where the 0.042 BTC is specified.
While we are on that, will it be a consensus change (is there even such a thing) for nodes to remove the cap?

The question of how to distribute bitcoins "fairly" and also to keep people "working' to validate transactions as adhering to the rules (i.e. spending real coins etc) was really the greatest problem that Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin) overcame.
In short he figured out a new way of ensuring that people would want to stay honest (all follow the same rules) and that coins could be issued using one and the same process. Users would, when they ran the client program, use some of their CPU cycles to try and solve complex problems of a calculated 'difficulty'. Every 10 minutes (roughly), one of the users would 'win' this lottery by solving the problem and would be rewarded with some (freshly minted/new) bitcoins. In this way, a user could increase his chance of winning by supplying more CPU cycles. As more users join the network the difficulty of this problem increases according to an algorithm which everybody agrees to by downloading the client in the first place. The difficulty increasing makes the chances of solving the problem harder, this balances more people 'trying' to win either through dedicating more CPU power or simply there being more people using Bitcoin. If you are interested in this part then look up "Bitcoin mining' on google, it is very interesting in itself.
However this is not all, the 'miners' from above also play another crucial role. Whilst trying to 'solve' the problem above first they also collect all the transactions sent around the network and include these as part of the 'working' in their solutions to the problem, checking them for validity at the same time. If a transaction is valid they will include it, if they do not recognise it as valid they will simply discard it and forget about it.
Each time a miner solves a problem (called finding a 'block'), the transactions they recognised as valid will all be in one block, also known as having "1 confirmation". The miner quickly uploads their solved block to the other miners who will again verify all transactions and the solution to the problem as valid, and if they agree they will add the block to the top of their copy of the 'blockchain' (a sequence of all previous blocks) and start working on a solution for the next block, also including a reference to the previous block in their solution for the next block. In this way each new block further cements the validity of the block before it.
This is the distributed consensus system, and the real beauty of Bitcoin; that it happens to have some monetary value/utility is quite honestly a side-effect of people recognising the power of a distributed consensus system like this.
The way this system acts to keep people acting honestly is because if they try and 'rip off' the system or other users in some way ("poofing" bitcoins into existence etc.) if they then manage to solve a 'block successfully, they will only get so far as sending their solved block to other miners who will then immediately reject it as it does not appear valid according to their rules (they have no interest in acting dishonestly), resulting in wasted time, energy and essentially lost money for the dishonest miner; they have most to gain by acting honestly and winning a valid block!
Another aspect of Bitcoin that a lot of people find particularly agreeable stems from something I mentioned earlier when I talked about algorithms: that is that all aspects of Bitcoin are found in the (open source) code right now; i.e. by using the software you are inherently implying recognition and agreement with the predetermined nature of various aspects of how the coin works and is distributed. Most notably is the rate of issuance which happens as part of solving a block. In the beginning the rate was 50 bitcoins per block solved, this will half to 25 bitcoins per block after a number of blocks has elapsed which should be equal to roughly 4 years (of 10 minute blocks). This will happen every 4 years until roughly the year 2140, when there will be less than 0.0000001 Bitcoins per block solved (essentially nothing).
This is incredibly useful because users all know how many coins there are issued, how many there will be next week, next year, in 5 years and even roughly in 100 years! Now try and tell me how many units of your national currency there will be in 6 months!!! Do you agree to all the printing of money ~~(inflation)~~ that inevitably goes on in your country and is sometimes perceived (rightly or wrongly) as directly benefiting the rich/bankers who it flows most directly to (it's supposed to "trickle down" from businesses/banks to us mortals, but does this really happen in practice, who knows...)? I can tell you that there are more than a few in the Bitcoin community who do not and seek to use Bitcoin as a hedge against their national currency for reasons similar to this, whether this is your personal view is of course up to you, but I just thought I would point it out for you ;)
~~Bitcoin is often cited as being "deflationary", however technically it is inflating, just at an ever decreasing rate.~~ As pointed out be below I am apparently using a very outdated definition of the word inflation in this sentence, apparently bitcoin (should) become deflationary in terms of prices falling, if it is being used and the rate of new supply is contantly decreasing. But the original crossed out sentence still stands in terms of the way in which the money supply changes over time.
There is a great deal more to Bitcoin, and a really good place to start is the "Bitcoin whitepaper" (written by the creator of the original software), even if you don't understand some of the cryptography bits just push through it (it's only 8 pages! ;))
Apologies this got so long, I could talk for hours about this sh*t though :) Let me know if you have any more questions and I can either answer them or point you to the right places to look for more info.

OK coinbreaker, so first off I would seriously reconsider offering bitcoin refunds, in my humble opinion this is not sensible due to the volatility which is possible at certain times with bitcoin. Most large companies accepting bitcoin now will do it for no refunds, or refunds only in local currency, this is of course up to you though...
If you want to retain some % as bitcoin for your own personal use, then I might recommend this though! :)
So, as a European, I would recommend BIPS.me over Bitpay or Coinbase which are both US-centric. BIPS.me is based in Denmark I believe. 
To accept bitcoin using them you should visit  and fill in username, password, email, date of birth and tick the box to accept terms and conditions and hit signup. After you have done this you will have a profile and be taken to a 'dashboard' page. Here, you need to fill in some basic info about your business (its name etc) on the "Business Profile" page.
When you have done this you must verify your account using the 'verify account' page (from the menu on the left). This requires submitting two documents, an ID and a Proof of Residence. This stage might take a few days for your info to be manually verified.
After that, you can setup a bank account to receive payments to using the 'payment accounts' page.
After you have done that you should choose how much bitcoin to convert to local currency, which can be done on this page (within the 'business profile' page)  
If you want to retain a % as bitocoin you should setup a bitcoin wallet, if you would like to do this let me know and I can help with that too, but for now I will just assume that you want to start by converting 100% to local currency.
Now I think you should be more or less setup with BIPs.me....
So, to accept bitcoin on your website you should integrate a payment button - this can be done quite easily but I'm afraid I can't help you with this as I am not really a website guy. If you have a website guy, you should let him know that BIPS.me website will create a button for you automatically but it is quite technical, involving API keys and obviously adding to the code of the page. Within your BIPS.me dashboard at  on the right hand side you can see the link to "create a payment button".
To accept bitcoin at the till is actually easier, and can be done with either a mobile device (cool!) or using your computer screen. Either way, the payee will have to scan a QR code on the screen used.
To do it using your computer screen, head to page  when you are logged into your account. From there, click the button "Generate checkout URL". This will make a small blue text hyperlink appear below the large QR code. If you click on that it will open a fullscreen webpage which you use to let people pay you. I would save this page as a bookmark so you can easily open it any time someone wants to pay you in bitcoin.
For here is very easy, simply fill in the description, amount and currency and hit checkout. This will generate a unique QR code which your payee can scan using his/her bitcoin app which will automatically fill in the fields in their wallet with the correct amount and your BIPS.me bitcoin address. All they have to do is confirm and hit send!
Even though this seems long it is mostly signup. The next time someone wants to pay using bitcoin, you just open the webpage which you bookmarked, fill in new description and amount and hit generate again. Very easy in my opinion.
If your customers want an invoice these can be generated and printed from this page 
Let me know if you have any questions and I will try to help you out. Hopefully I made it quite clear.
DISCLAIMER: I have never used BIPS.me myself as a merchant and I am in no way affiliated with their service, I just think it would be best fit for you as you are in the EU.
Good luck! :D

It sounds to me like you don't have any idea about the nature of either of these two 'problems'
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:17:54
I had a cold storage netbook running a pre-0.91.x version of the software.
When I created a tx using 0.91 or 0.93 (can't remember) on my online watch-only machine and tried to sign it on the old offline machine it would not accept it.
This of course was no real problem, I simply restored the old version of the app onto the online machine and recreated the transaction (no wallet files/keys etc. or the database was changed AFAIK sot this was very fast and easy).
After I had made the transaction though I wanted to fix this and wanted to be on the new software on both machines. So I downloaded the .deb from the Armory site and GPG verified the hash. transferred it over to the offline machine and updated. Then updated the online machine back to 0.93... No problems yet, seems very safe and easy.
Just to be sure I deleted my wallet (made on the "old" Armory) from the offline machine and used the seed to restore it in the newly updated Armory (on the offline machine), again working with no problems (just selecting the right "wallet restore" type during restore).
So in sumamry, I think the short answer is no. You are not going to *lose* anything doing any updates with Armory, I believe they make this a priority always when they update the software too... **But**, I think there are some issues if you are signing tx's generated on very new versions of the software using older versions on your offline machine (pre 0.91?).
Hopefully an Armory dev or someone more knowledgeable than me will comment and add to this, but this was my experience.

Well, it seems like English might not be your first language, but


What this means is that if you do not want to verify to Tier 3 (by submitting your documents) then they can refund the money to (only) the sending bank.
What you said in the comment above mine was:


You seem to think that you *have* to submit a selfie either way (whether being Tier 3 verified or not), but this is not the case.
To get your money back you can *either*:
i) Verify to Tier 3 (by sending in a selfie)
ii) Ask to have the money sent back to the sending bank.
This is what should happen according to what they say. If they are still withholding your deposit then it must be for another reason. But your whole tirade of anger against them seems to be unjustified as they are just (presumably) complying with the (stupid?) anti-money laundering regulations in the country they are operating in.

You will not need 15.5 million bitcoins to equal the value of 122 tonnes of gold. If somebody starts buying that many bitcoins the value of each coin will rise so that this number will decrease until the required value is reached.
It is probable that no mining is required.
The cost of transferring 122 tonnes of gold's value-worth of bitcoin would of course be so small as to be negligible next to the cost of shipping the physical bullion. Even taking into account the security of the network (which should not be counted as the individual making the transfer does not have to pay it, the miners are compensated by block rewards and transaction fees) it would still be dwarfed.
If you wanted to send $5 billion-worth of bitcoin (the value of the 122 tonnes of gold being moved) then all you have to do is buy the required number of coins and press send. There are no other costs to the sender than that.

The checksum is the last few characters (maybe 8, I forget) of the address. they will be the result of a hash of all that came before, so in the example address above, if you had misspelt even one character, but kept the same checksum (hash), (an error while copying by eye perhaps) as soon as you tried to send your coins there your wallet software would 'know' that you had mistyped a character and can alert you.

Seeing as i am a single individual, I found it easier (but perhaps less secure as it only involves a single device?) to use a single wallet but use the m-of-n backup option.

Once developers catch up and implement these kinds of standards as default, you will never need to hear about them yourself either, the same as how you have absolutely no idea what happens when you put your (legacy) card in a machine, but you know the other person recieves some of your funds (you may extrapolate this example to NFC/apple watch if you so choose).

Actually, I believe that it was just any transactions which happened within the timeframe (using the BC.I service), regardless of wallet/address creation dates.
A bitcoin transaction requires the use of a random "r" value each time, if this value is known (or the space in which it will be generated is sufficiently small) then the private keys can be derived using other (always) publicly available information as part of the transaction.

There is an iOS wallet called "Bit Wallet" that does do this (well, it has to do it to circumvent apple's current stance on wallet apps)... Basically it creates the tx for you in the app, and the last stage you click a button to copy the raw tx to clipboard and open  in safari, where you simply paste the raw tx and hit Submit.
Kinda neat really, given the limitations Apple imposed.

There is no concept of ownership of addresses in bitcoin. Two people generated the same key because they used a faulty generation method.
Having a key grants the owner ability to reallocate inputs associated with that key. However you should never have the same key as anyone else. If I lent you my key, then I should never use it again (and neither should you).
This is **why** bitcoin relies on generating random addresses and why it is so important.
btcrobinhood **saved** this fellow from **really** losing $20k as far as I can see. He did the "wrong" thing for the right reasons.

Hi, why did you choose not to use the "Baht" BTC symbol like the rest of the community if you dont mind me asking? That lower case b thing looks very strange and I genuinely wouldn't choose your app because it uses that.
I just thought I would let you know (devs like feedback right?) Other than that the app looks pretty nice :)
Edit: I have just read a comment below and it says the app is (by default) in bits; is the lower case slashed 'b' your take on a unit for bits?
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:59:37
I'm not sure about a whole $1 for each visit (I like many above me would be broke before the end of the month probably) but a wallet extension which you could fund and then would send tips to addresses of webpages you visited would be cool.
I think it might be fun (just to show off the tech) if the system worked a bit like a taxi meter does "either distance or time (but not both)"... 
So, if you just landed on the page and then closed or moved on it would be a nominal amount. But if you stayed on the page, up to a maximum of 5 minutes perhaps, it would increase your donation up to a maximum amount. This way sites/pages you were interested in would recieve a larger proportion of your total donation.
Of course, most people would want the amounts set at pennies or most likely small fractions of pennies, so it would be of negligible cost to consumers, hopefully the donations would add up for the recipients though...

You relly don't need to even involve the word intrinsic; 'Value' is subjective. It doesn't matter whether somebody tries to desribe it as 'intrinsic' or not.
Different persons, life forms, forms of awareness throughout the universe undoubtedly assign different amounts of value to various chemicals and compounds, presumably as Andreas says, based on their scarcity rather than some magic "intrinsicness", wouldn't you agree?
For us human beings, perhaps water has *some* intrinsic value as it is required for life to continue, but that is subjective and relies on being a human who wants to live.

Yes, I think the main point should be that he acted so slowly that he put the funds in jeopardy; they easily could have devalued by the same percentage they increased in value by.
Really what he should have done is spent them as promised, right away, avoiding this whole issue...
As it happens, he held them, got "lucky" (OK most of us might still argue that they are undervalued ;)) and now has a choice with what to do with them.
Some called for them to go to Bitcoin "causes" (like the recently questioned Sean's Outpost) and development of protocol etc. But really when you think about it members donated that money for the forum. Also can you imagine the stink that wouyld be kicked up when he started donating to things some donators did not agree with?
I think all in all he has probably done "the least worst" thing, but the shadiness of the company he chose to do business with really makes me uneasy. If he had contracted in some guys not called "slickage" run by "wangbus" with no prior track record @ 100k/month then I think nobody could really argue that he was not doing with the funds what was promised to be done with them.

Sorry to inform you of this mate but you're a muppet for doing that. If coinbase goes down or gets hacked, who has you private keys? Not you, that's who.
If you don't exclusively hold the keys to your bitcoin addresses, then YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY BITCOIN. All that you have by storing your coins on coinbase is a IOU from them that they owe bitcoins which you hope they will honour.
I don't care if it's worked for a year, or if it continues to work for another year, my point still stands. At least at Blockchain.info YOU control your keys.
Disclaimer: I hold no bitcoins at either coinbase or blockchain.info.

I think I have to agree with sedaak here, although he could have gone about things a little nicer...
Bitcoind is a text-based bitcoin client. On top of this has been built Bitcoin-QT; a graphical user interface built on top of bitcoind.
I really fail (too) to see why you would take a text-based program, covert it to GUI and then use a screen reader to re-convert that GUI to text again. That's just silly.
If you are not talking about bitcoind/bitcoin-QT (eg electrum, multibit, armory etc) then you might have a point, but I don't think it is valid for bitcoind.

Sorry if this is a silly question but it just seems that currently I am just taking your word for it when I switch the toggle in the settings panel...

They are just some possible denominations that someone put onto a random webpage!...
The only real defined denomination is xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx where 1.00000000 = 1 bitcoin.
Any others are just made up and agreed by a few people, perhaps including yourself, perhaps not.
It should also be noted that with adequate consensus of the community, even this denomination could be moved via a movement of the decimal place position.

Firstly it would be good to know:
1) Do you want to retain bitcoin as bitcoin from people who paid using this method, or to convert some (or all) of it into your local currency?
2) If you want to convert into local currency what country are you based in?
3) Do you *want* to be able to accept bitcoin at the counter, or only prepayment (via a webpage)?
4) If you want to be able to accept people paying at the counter do you have a smartphone or tablet which is running iOS (an apple device) or Android (most other, non-windows devices)?
Then we can move foward from here.
In the mean time, I really would stop downloading bitcoin core blockchain unless you would like to contribute back to the network itself, it is not required for safe acceptance of bitcoin.
We can decide which wallet might be best for you (if you choose to retain some % or all of your bitcoin as bitcoin) as required.

I can't look at your original blog post because it is blocked wherre I am, but if it really is a "transaction **rate** cycle" graph then I do not understand why you keep dismissing the obvious solution that two respondants have provided you with now: namely that when people (users) in the active bitcoin areas (areas with highest node concentrations) are awake, they send more transactions. When they go to sleep, they send less.
Why you are talking about "one transaction per user" and "one payment processor" I have no idea.

Nice review, I would point out though that I do not think the definition of a "hot wallet" is a wallet provider who holds your keys for you as is insinuated. Rather, a hot wallet would be any wallet which is connected to the internet at large, in this case, all the wallets.
A "cold" wallet would by comparison be stored on a medium which has never been connected to the internet directly (and never will be) e.g. paper wallet or permanently offline netbook, coming in a close second would be a device which was connected to the network once before, but will not be again (and you are sure that it is not virus-infected so that sRNG being used is not compromised).

I think this is the third comment of yours I am replying to in this thread, but it could have been more than this... you really do like to pick apart the words of others don't you...I guess you are maybe correct though so w/e floats your boat.
Anyway, what term would you use in place of balance seeing as you hate it so much? The balance is traditionally the difference between credits and debits, or amounts received and amounts owed. As I understand it, an address (has of a pub key) can be sent bitcoins, bitcoins can also be debited from it. Alhtough this requires the use of another key, the address "balance" can still be worked out.
Do you call a single pub/priv key pair a "wallet"? If so, that sounds silly to me, sorry.

Hey man, don't get me wrong; I (like every other English speaker that I have ever encountered) am perfectly happy to use "mils" in every day parlance to refer to millimetres, millions, millilitres etc...
However, what I am saying is that in an engineering context, you just cannot say "mil" as this is likely to be interpreted in many different ways by many different people, for example this over ~40 are very likely to assume that you are talking about "mils"' which **are** thousandths of an inch, if you are talking about it in terms of a length dimension.

As I understood the situation (from brief reading) Luke had taken a (the "official") bitcoin package 'bitcoin core' and slipped it into the Gentoo package repository *with his own patch silently enabled*, which is very deceptive...
Had he chosen to call the package "Bitcoin Core Luke-JR edition" or similar, or else had the flags off by default, then none of this would have been an issue.
But I have not had a good read on what actually happened and do not use Gentoo, so must disclaim that I might very well be wrong here.

But you exclusively don't have the private keys, therefore you DO NOT HAVE THE BITCOIN.
You have "access to the bitcoin" provided that **they** allow you to access them via **their** site.
This is the exact reason so many people get "hacked" in this space; they entrust their bitcoin to a third party who 'loses' them or 'gets hacked'.
If **you** don't have the private keys, **you** do not have the bitcoins! just a promise to be able to access them that you hope someone else will honour.

(Mine is the metallic case version and) yes it is working very well, seems to be safe and easy to use. Plus, it still hasnt been hacked which is quite a nice bonus. (OK that is tongue in cheek; there is really no reasonable way this should be able to be hacked but you never know in the bitcoin world so most of my coin is still in offiline storage).
I have been comparing it with KryptoKit (Chrome extension-based wallet) and a few other 'Lite' wallet systems, besides the obvious example of being able to plug this into any (even a compromised?) computer, the Trezor also provides a very comforting and stable user experience.
Tl;dr All workign well thanks.

If you would read the white paper on bit coin written by Satoshi nakamoto, you would see that he explains that the incentives to commit fraud using the network should be so expensive to the attacker that it would be in his (economic) interest to not commit fraud (as mining returns would be greater).
In this case that is invalidated, but that is still the intention of the protocol as it was originally written. 
Sheesh, do I have to fucking spell it out for you you snarky so-in-so.

Yes ok, it's a "real bad idea". If you had reporters posting the value of items in your house you might not like it do much.

But just keep laughing pal.

* a massive range (arguably infinite) of objective benefits and flexibility for end consumers over already extant payment methods and currencies
* Current deficiencies in the network's design which makes it impractical for use in any real world setting require merely software tweaks to change (try reading the wiki). Also implementations of alt coins, sidechains and other technologies can easily overcome any current design limits. Compare the amount of innovation in the bitcoin field in the last 12 months to the last 12 years in the incumbent banking system I and bitcoin still obviously wins out - those guys are standing still!

OK sure, but they guy wasn't even advocating buying BTC instead of gold, he only said something like "imagine if 5% of gold market moved into BTC", you pressed him for reasoning which he provided (relatively poorly).
It would not surprise me if at first risk-taking investors got involved with bitcoin, and as (if) the asset stabilised/matured then some of the old market might move into this (more stable) asset with a decent history.
I don't think anyone is saying "5% of gold value will move into bitcoin by 2015"...
[Mid-response Edit: Just seen that this thread is called "Predicting Bitcoin price by 2016" - if this is the only reason you are riled up (you think he means it might realistically happen by 2016) then I apologise, I somehow forgot what this thread was all about in our long discussion, if not then I maintain my position!]
Also I would disagree with your singular reason for diversification; some people might diversify in order to "safely" maximised profits: If my portfolio was 100% gold right now moving myself into a 5-10% bitcoin position might provide an, interesting, diversification with potential for a lot of return.

I have talked to the CEOs of both companies on the phone recently (small companies are cool for that!) and they both really really want to re-allow deposits to bitcoin exchanges (as they were getting huge volume from it primarily) and they both were generally very pro-bitcoin...
Neither would (sensibly) tell me exactly whey they couldn't allow bitcoin-related transactions, but I think from how they both said things that it really amounts to their bank accounts not being closed down, which would be a pretty major set-back for either of these companies as I'm sure you can understand...

And they narrowed it down to west coast? That's pretty specific... Well, I have read all Satoshi'd posts but didn't check the time stamps, but how do they know what time of day he was posting? Was he a morning or evening (or last night) poster?

Ok well as other people have said, sto pusing the computer that had your multibit wallet on right now. Do not use it. Do not try to restore from backup. Stop. Now.
Next, find another computer and download a portable OS, or try to install an OS like Ubuntu to a USB drive or CD.
Next you can insert your portable OS into the computer which had the wallet, boot the the OS (might need to enter bios and change the boot order so that CD drive or USB is above the internal HDD) and then you can start looking for your wallet file.
If you can't find it with regular searches, there are programs which can find it even if it has been "deleted" from the hard drive (really when a filer is "deleted" they just delete the record of where it was on the hard drive, so the next time the drive needs to write files it "sees" empty space. Really the file is still there though until overwritten, so make sure you are not doing anything on it until you find it...

Last I heard anyone can make a subreddit. Why not make a new one of your own if you don't like this one (this is his one)?
Also, I seem to remember that someone had mirrored the bitcointalk forum at  (although how many use that version is debatable). Theymos has allowed this mirroring of his forum (automatic and post for post as far as I know) which is quite a reasonable move, so, if you don't like bitcointalk then you could very easily move there...?
The wiki is, well a wiki. Open to editing by all, subject to moderation. Again, if you don't like it move elsewhere.
Don't you see, that choice you have **IS** decentralisation. There is not simply one location you are *forced* to use, you make the choice.

I really don't understand why upon reflection you don't just admit your mistake, or even say that "you couldn't care less" about being correct (would be topical too), but instead try to argue a completely ridiculous point about them *both* meaning that you don't care... Oh well.

That is a monetary definition of inflation (money supply), **if** you wanted to use the *other*, more widespread "definition" of inflation, a change in the purchasing power of your money, then bitcoin has certainly been deflating (and might well continue to do so even if more units are issued).

Your last point is completely wrong :D but I know why you think that...
Those 12 small words give you a 128bit completely random, highly secure seed.
If you used all keys on the keyboard this would equate roughly to a 65 character random password (in classic gobbledygook form).
It is much easier to not make a mistake by writing down 12 short words that you know though, and if you enter them regularly, you will eventually remember the 12 words, but not the random character password.

Good question!
There are actually two sources of income for miners right now: the "freshly minted" bitcoins created as new as a reward according to the protocol, and also any transaction fees a user chooses to attach to their transaction.
Now, transaction fees are not mandatory at all, free transactions will be picked up eventually and mined so you always have that option, however most users will attach a small nominal fee (0.0001BTC) probably the vale of a few €/$ cents at most. The reason for this is that most miners will configure their software to prioritise transactions which have a fee attached.
Another thing to note here is that currently blocks are limited in size to 1MB. Whilst the value of a transaction (in dollar/euro/Bitcoin terms) is irrelevant, the actual size of the transaction (in kilobytes) has a cost associated with it. I.e a transaction of any number of coins coming from a single output being sent to to a single address will be (small), whereas a transaction referencing multiple previous addresses ("joining coins together") going to multiple new addresses whilst perfectly possible, will usually "cost more" (although can still be done for free technically).
What this means you end up with is a cost/kb of data, with the system being completely agnostic to the value of the transaction. You can send a million dollars or fractions of a dollar for the same cost effectively! Forget percentage fees of the current legacy systems!!
When the value of the new coins/block begins to decrease two things should subsidise the miners:
1) transaction fees will likely increase, if block size is still limited (not looking likely now by the way, people are talking of raising it as we speak) then completion  to be included will increase too, with miners presumably still favouring higher fee (per kilobyte) transactions.
2) if Bitcoin is still going at that point in time it is incredibly likely that each Bitcoin will be worth a tremendous amount more than today. This "increased exchange rate" will keep miner "profits" (in dollar terms) higher than you might imagine just be looking at the "number of bitcoins" issued in nominal terms.

I do not use electrum so I don't know how that can confuse me? **You** are confusing me!
Does send from not let you select a specific UTXO to send funds from (which were originally sent to a specific address?) This would allow me to, for example, after donating to a certain public charity address to spend diffrerent coins not tainted with that first transaction, providing some small semblance of anonyimity.
So it is useful, unless you can prove otherwise.
Edit: Huh, so I guess I was being slightly dumb after all. I started in this thread talking about the semantics of the word address. When you replied I viewed the context and saw "addresses" and "send from" which i then included in my reply. Now, here we are and I must confess that I did not realised that this thread was talkign about "send from" in the context of an electrum wallet, which I have to say I know nothing about....although... I would *assume* that it worked the same as other "send from" functions which, and I'm sure this choice of language will rile you up a bit, allows for sending from a specific address!

Although this is technically correct in the way I believe the question was asked, in another way emptier blocks are kind of "faster" to mine...
Only because when a suitable hash is found, the solved block itself can potentially be transmitted to more of the network faster than a different block which contains more transactions and is larger (bit-size). This means the smaller block is less likely to be orphaned - where the block recieved second is rejected by the majority of the network and therefore ends up not being part of the main chain.
There is work being done to make all solved blocks the same size when being first transmitted to the network for validation and addition to the chain. It would be possible under this system for other nodes to verify whether the block has been solved "correctly" before(or whilst) downloading the rest of the block data, therfore eliminating all difference between solving a transaction light/transaction heavy block.

Actually I think it kind of does; the chart stops along the date axis in November, and the price axis is at a maximum above the maximum deviation above the average trend line as calculated by the graph producer...
What this says to me is that we do not know the future, but since inception until today, the trend line is "x", using "these" deviations (edit: I have seen in a comment further down that OP used ln(0.3) for each band as this "kept all price swings within the rainbow") we can try to estimate at which points in time Bitcoin *might* be over or under-valued in terms of its immediate price vs. it's trending growth.
I think what might be putting you off is that it **appears** that if you were to extrapolate the graph any further then we would be in a serious exponential uptrend, but the OP has not act silly done this, it is mostly in your imagination.

_niko, I will of course accept that the description I have given is by no means perfectly exact, but to term it a fallacy I think would be slightly unfair, not to mention that I disagree with you that it is:


The work that the miners are doing is in fact quite literally solving a hard problem - they have to find a hash of a set of (valid) data which falls below an arbitrary level (the difficulty) set by an algorithm determined by the average rate of previously solved blocks. I am not sure what you think is inconsistent with that analogy as to be honest I don't even think it is an analagy at all, rather a simplification of what is happening.
The purpose of mining which you go on to talk about is technical above the level at which I aimed my reply; I don't disagree that miners order and timstamp transactions into a ledger but I was explaining in the context of the question asked to a person who I presumed did not know a lot (anything) about bitcoin. I believe that my answer was at an approprate level and do not think that if I had replied:


...whilst accurate (but not the best description of it I have heard) it would not be anywhere near as easy for the questioner to understand. The question I was responding to was:


My answer responded by touching on the concepts of blocks, mining and the blockchain, I dont think the answer you have given does the same.

Why on earth would a merchant accept CAD in that case?
That argument is just ridiculous.
What it *might* do (hopefully) is cause everyone to think for a second about whether or not they really need to frivolously spend their earnings on crap they usually don't need. This IMO would be a good thing.
If you need something you will buy it using CAD or bitcoin or whatever you are allowed to use, provided the need for the item is greater than the opportunity cost for holding the currency. Currently, you are encouraged to spend, which has I will admit pushed mankind's development forward nicely until this point. However all this spending is bad for the environment and bad for us the people who are now is massive debt both individually and as nation states.
A second of thought as to whether you really want to spend your money would be highly beneficial in this sense.
The notions that you would not spend bitcoin because there is a chance it might (price) deflate is nonsense though. People happily sell gold and silver even though it has been "increasing" in (dollar) value for years.

Being reliant on checkpoints kinda defeats the purpose of the Blockchain history (ok not really) so at this stage you could say bitcoin still has the training wheels on; it still relies on the help of the devs to hardcode checkpoints.

I thought I gave the distinct impression that the point of mining was to both distribute coins and to validate transactions. In fact, after talking about coin distribution I even went on to say:


Pointing out how miners validate transactions... Apologies if it did not come across this way, it was intended to and I never mentioned it being "wasteful" or even "random", these seem to be things that you have inferred on your own. I believe in the way I explained it it actually sounded quite useful, whereas in the way you have described it I might (as an outsider) think "meh, I could design a database to add transactions to very easily", missing a lot of the beauty of the system.

Block size is not limited by hard drive space, miners are limiting block size artificially below the (current arbitrary) 1mb size because of propagation times, not storage concerns.

No one broke into anyone elses house though, that is completely different and obviously violates many basic rights an individual should have.
Here, an individual stored a balance of coins at a public address in a public address ledger. However, being a distributed P2P system bitcoin relies on the generation of completely random addresses to ensure that no two persons ever meet like this.
No one "owns" any address, they are simply storing their coins at on which no-one else can possibly generate as there are 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 unique addresses. Now, should you use an script to generate one using the word "password" as the 'magic' (non-random!) input, you should expect that somebody else might try it too.
This is exactly what happened here. Who does the address "belong" to? Nobody. Those coins might have originally belonged to someone but bitcoin is run off statistics and cryptography, there is no centralised entity who "assigns" addresses to people or anything like that.
This might be a shift in thinking, but once people get their heads round it they will begin to realise that a random bitcoin address is simply as secure as it gets, and is far more secure than any bank account or door look could ever be.

I think LeeWallis is right. If you want to send money to someone not involved with bitcoin then changetip for small amounts is fine.
If you are going to be sending regular payments or larger amounts then there is absolutely no reason to involve a (vulnerable) thrid party such as ChangeTip; just take the 2 minutes it takes to each download a bitcoin wallet client and exchange addresses.

Actually it's not. Bitcoin is a protocol. A protocol which solves the problem of a decentralised proof of ownership scheme. In this case the tokens are called bitcoins. It happens, because of their scarcity, that these *can* be used as money (currency). But this is really only a single application, there will follow many more applications relying on the bit coin protocol which will not be currency.
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:07:51

So I think the other have it covered, but basically you get some bitcoins (however) then message the tipbot and he will create an account for you (in his ledger) for your reddit profile, this gives you an address.
Send some bitcoin to this address and your "reddit account" is funded. Then simply type as I did above to have the bitcointip bot come and verify your comment and send bitcoin to anybody with a reddit profile you like. As easy as that.
Don't need to setup a bank account, pay international wire fees or anything like that (OK so the recipient should make a wallet outside of reddit tip bot to keep his/her own money safe, but this is free for all!)
Really it's a demonstration of how bitcoin can be used for micro (or not-so-micro) payments to anyone anywhere in the world. A good example of this might be micro-payments for agreeing with a sentiment, comment or perhaps for reading a well-written new article.
Can't do that by sending someone 0.05$ for virtually no cost!

No. [Block 356657]( (for example) will still be available, visible and identical in 5 years as it is today. This block could be safely stored on a read-only part of a disk just to prove the point and there would be no ill-effects to the node/bitcoin. The data is not altered.
The data can *mean* whatever you like it to mean, for example, you might be asking the question  "how many bitcoins were at this address on 16th May 2015?" or you might be asking "how many bitcoins are at this address **today**?" which may both give you different answers, but it does not change the fact that the blockchain data, once it receives enough confirmations, cannot be altered (except by a reorg).

But you only pay the same amount because the credit card companies will not service a merchant who charges their customers more for using CC.
In a proper free market, paying using cash would be cheaper, because as you have rightly identified you forgo the "benefits" of using CC. However the companies have effectively blackmailed merchants into being unable to do this, so, as you say 'you might as well pay by card'.

Bitcoin is not a currency per se, it is a distributed consensus system whose users have placed value upon their units of account. These units of account also happen to be (very) easily, securely and quickly transferred between users.
If you really want to go down the road of only comparing exactly like for like, then there is nothing that has ever existed with which to compare bitcoin to; it is the most stable and most volatile asset of its class, ever.
Otherwise, I think your voiding the comparison is invalid itself.

There's no need to be such a smart Alec. I think most reasonable people are in favour of Segregated Witness, for many more reasons than you mention too (although it doesn't solve all malleability - your phrasing might mislead some people into thinking that). I don't know quite what "support in in favour of..." means, but I do not think SegWit is a replacement for block size limit increase, in case that was what you were implying.


Nobody is asking for "infinite scaling at this time", I'm not sure where you got that idea... perhaps you have misinterpreted some of the Bitcoin Unlimited desires? "Not possible because of technical barriers" is not an actual limiting factor, it is just string of words. Which exact "technical barriers" exist prevent any max block size limit increase? All tests run so far (by others) have indicated that we could increase max block size limit by a considerable %, today, and be completely fine. I'm not sure why you think 1MB is such a magic number? I would be very interested to see any tests which have been run which show that this number is too big, or somehow prove that it can be only this number (i.e. it really is the "magic" number) for us today...


To be honest I'm not really bothered how much you hear this; perhaps for your own well-being you could spend less time on forums if you hear it too much? Anyway, whatever semantics you choose to use, I am telling you what I signed up for by participating in the system. I am obviously the only person who can know this. Bitcoin is experimental, blah blah, red herring. Erm, decentralisation of "layer 0" (is that from Satoshi's parlance too, or is this something else new, made up to re-mould Bitcoin into a new form?) There is an argument which can be made that be keeping blocks artificially and arbitrarily capped at 1MB, you are leading to natural centralisation of miners inside China, where other non-network costs associated with mining are almost universally most beneficial. I have not seen any decent evidence for this, or studied or modelled this myself though. I think that having possibility of larger blocks (of course each block's size is ultimately at the discretion of the miner) would force miners to at least desire to have pools/pool nodes operating on each side of the firewall.


Yes I am referring to centralised lightning hubs. Also I do not like the mechanism of lightning: having to deposit bitcoins and then keep payment channels open to see any benefit. What about individual microtransactions, IOT transactions etc. None of these are possible with this system as I understand it (which also does not yet exist).

An accounting system is what confers to a unit of account some particular set of properties; the properties of a unit of account cannot be separated from the accounting system, but the unit of account most certainly can be separated from the accounting system.
Even with a 2-way peg the satoshis are always accounted for completely in the Bitcoin ledger and never "leave" or are "separated".

@_date: 2017-03-24 00:21:50
It's not about "asking permission", it's about providing the correct incentives for the miners. The way Bitcoin can operate trustlessly at all is that miners are incentivised by the protocol to perform legitimate block validation (according to the protocol rules which everyone inherently agrees to by running the software independently).
The whole system literally relies on financial incentivisation of the miners: if they validate and include transactions in a compliant way, they will collect the tx fees for those transactions. If they try to cheat the system (award themselves extra coins, double spend etc.) then all the rest of the honest nodes will reject their block - they lose out financially from cheating - playing honest is the best policy.
It was also noticed by Satoshi, that nobody would be incentivised enough to mine at the beginning, when Bitcoin was almost worthless, as a tiny percentage of a handful of transactions (tx fees) was not enough reward for the job. He concluded that there should be an initial "block reward" which would be given to miners who successfully mine a block, adding the required additional incentives needed for (the majority) of miners to act honestly in the system back in the beginnning. This block reward also had the effect of solving the issuance problem (how do you "float" the currency) and putting intrinsic inflation controls, visible for all to see, into the cash system (in stark contrast to the QE-type behaviour exhibited by many nation states to their currencies today).
The point of this is, that Bitcoin is designed so that it will consider the selfish, profit-seeking behaviour of the miners from the start - the only way this can be circumvented would require collision from &gt;50% of miners, the so-called 51% attack.
It is also important to remember that miners are paid in BTC. This means that, as the block reward naturally drops as programmed they have two ways of making more money: for a fixed number of transactions per block they must rely on increasing the BTC exchange rate whilst also increasing BTC/kb transaction fee. The other approach is to increase block size, allowing more tx/second, allowing them to keep a lower BTC/kb fee level, but still collecting the same revenue, whilst also hoping the value per BTC increases as above.
The miners it seems have deduced that if block size remains fixed, that bitcoin will become less valuable (as in exchange rate) so they can increase fee/kb to maintain profits for a while, but long term fixed block size is causing devaluation of Bitcoin, impacting their profits.
For non-miners there are also decentralisation and other principles to consider, although miners should also consider these in a secondary manner too: if the project loses its decentralisation then it will (likely) lose its value to a lot of people. This depends exactly how short term the view of the miner is.
Mining centralisation is a tough problem too, almost impossible to provide ASIC-resistant PoW. But again we should not blame miners for acting rationally in their self interests, merely try to improve the incentives in the system to naturally arrive at the behaviour we want to see. This was Satoshi's original brilliance.

No coins are split in two. This statement heavily implies that what you have ends up halved, in fact you will have the full amount on both chains, more akin to being doubled.

No, you are not "the network". For example with 30% of hashing power and some variance (luck) on your side, you will be able to perform a 6 block selfish mining attack occasionally. This can happen to a further and lesser extend depending on hashing power and luck.

Personally, I want to see increased transaction throughput **on** the blockchain, not anywhere else. So, again for me personally, this *is* in fact about the block size limit. I would like to see a scaled-up, decentralised system - not centralised systems built on top of a decentralised system or anything like that. I signed up for the original vision.

I think what you would immediately want to do is to generate a new address using a wallet on each different chain fork and aquire a small amount of bitcoin from a post-fork coinbase transaction on each chain. Next, send your entire balance to yourself, once on each chain, in a transaction which combined all the pre-fork inputs and at least one address generated post fork.
Both of these two transactions would be rejected by the other chain, and so your full balance (at time of split) would be confirmed into each new chain.
This would allow you to, for example, sell all coins on one side (presumably for coins on your favoured fork).
Warning: this might be a little incorrect, am not an expert, hopefully someone will correct me if my understanding is not right.

I don't mean to be rude or terse, because I'm sure your reply will help out somebody else reading this who didn't already know that, but nothing about what you have said invalidates or even seeks to answer my proposal.
We all know that SegWit will give us this tx multiplier, but we are still going to need bigger blocks in the future, why not write that into the roadmap, in the order in which the actions will occur (e.g. blocksize increase after SegWit implemented) and then everybody can be clear that this is something that is going to happen in the future?
I'm sure I have read that lightning network will likely need bigger blocks than 1MB, even WITH benefits of SegWit, so surely even "big evil Blockstream-core-coin" (if that happened to be your point of view of core dev team) must want bigger blocks, at some point - get it in the roadmap now to ease peoples minds...
Not to mention that implementation and hard fork schedule will take time, it will likely be at LEAST 12-18 months before this can happen in practice, so they should start moving with it now, in my opinion.

I will add my interpretation of this to the other responses for you.
So to begin with, it is important to note that "bitcoin as we know it" has not always been around, and will certainly not be around forever more. One of the key elements of bitcoin is the consensus element of the code: people can build different bitcoin programs (wallets, nodes, miners etc) in a variety of different (programming) languages and all with different features, however to remain on the same blockchain ("bitcoin as we know it" today) they all must follow the same consensus rules, otherwise there is risk of a fork.
A fork is where one entity produces a block which some others do not find to be valid, but some do. This can result in two blockchains running simultaneously for a while, until one of them wins out. The way all (decent) bitcoin programs will 'know' which fork is the 'winning' fork is by seeing which one has had the most "work" done to it, this is known as the "longest" chain. The "length" of a chain is calculated as the total combined work done on that chain. Read up on mining if you want to know more about this.
What is happening here is that the current developers of Bitcoin-Qt have decided not to implement a consensus rule which the developers of Bitcoin XT are planning on implementing. This consensus rule relates to the maximum 'allowable' block size.
When the Bitcoin XT software with this new patch in is released, if enough people run it, then after a certain date bigger blocks will be allowed to be mined by miners following these consensus rules. At this point, users still using Bitcoin-Qt (if it is still without this consensus patch) will not recognise these blocks as valid, will reject them and then will end up on a different, concurrent blockchain.
There is much discussion about the personalities and motives of each set of developers behind each consensus decision, but also some technical discussion, modelling and other economic arguments being made.
To your last point, technically any consensus changes result in a "new currency" or "altcoin", however in the past more developers have, after much healthy discussion and debate, agreed upon them more widely.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:54:00
In fact the best option is to have a wallet from each fork ready. Also, as soon as the fork happens buy a very small amount of coins (from newly mined coins) from each fork.
Then send all the coins in your ("new", hard fork) wallet (including your old balance) to yourself. This block will only be mined by "new" miners.
Afterwards, send your old balance again plus your small amount of (newly mined) "old" coins to yourself in your "old" wallet.
Now you have two wallets each exclusively on one blockchain with the same (BTC) amount of your previous balance. If you truly believe in one fork over the other, you can try and sell the coins you believe to be on the inferior fork for coins on the other fork, and try and increase your holdings on your preferred fork
If you just want to hold and don't care which fork wins, then you needn't do this.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:14:07
Perhaps he’s so rich he doesn’t care!
@_date: 2015-08-18 06:35:49
He can't just crack any wallet file. But if you can remember what you think the password was, or any other characteristics like its length, if there was two numbers on the end and two at the beginning etc... Then he can try and use brute force to guess close variations on what he knows. Like in OPs case, he probably knew what the password should be, so Dave could try missing letters, common keyboard errors etc.

I think we might be safe to increase the limit to 30t/s today though. A 10x increase vs the current (theoretical max).
Perhaps in the near future we will also be able to raise the limit to 300t/s (probably would also be safe to do today). Etc.
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:23:36
What should happen in the event that Bitcoin XT reaches a super-majority (the fact that it requires a super-majority is important), woudl be fairly minimal to you as just a user (using wallet software) only. All your pre-existing coins would be valid any you would be almost none the wiser. Transactions might confirm faster.
Because the consensus code is (generally) separated from wallet and other program types, these programs should experience little issue or changes as a result of this.
I should point out that if Bitcoin XT was coded to require only 51% (a "majority" but not a "super-majority") of nodes to be running it before it starting allowing "big blocks", then we would likely see some extremely damaging network behavior:
First, there would be two chains with almost equal hashing power behind them. As above, all your coins would be available to you on the new chain, and on the old chain! If you could find merchants who were accepting coins on different chains, you could spend the "same" coins twice! This is not good because eventually one chain will win out, then the merchant who has your coins which were sent to him on the losing chain is left with worthless coins.
Another side effect of not using a super-majority would be that there would be no 'winning' longest chain (with a super-majority) for a long time. With two distinct chains, but only a difference in hash power of 2%, statistically both chains should advance at almost the same rate. This means wallets would constantly flick between chains, as one became longer than the other and visa-versa.
This would also be particularly bad for 49% of the miners on the 49% chain; blocks that they mine would be rejected (eventually) which means they have not made any money for their work. Although there is a proviso for this in the code in a way: miners cannot spend mining reward coins for 99 blocks, giving enough time for chain 're-organizations' and hard-fork "length battles" to happen and be settled.
Finally, yes blockchain app will still hold bitcoin XT - it does not do any consensus so it makes almost difference to it - it will still just relay and fetch transactions from the network as usual. Which OS are you running Blockchain app on out of interest? it is not necessarily the best wallet app to be using in my humble opinion.
There are many other aspects to it, but I hope I have made some of it a little clearer for you.

Not sure what you are getting at here... the performance of bitcoin is not a measure of "how fast blocks come". The performance of miners could undoubtedly be increased by (one of) the best chip manufacturer(s) in the world producing ASICs, or indeed other chip types which can perform bitcoin-related operations more efficiently at a hardware level.
The performance of the protocol is increased as an effect of the ability of nefarious parties being less able to compromise the network - the ability for governments and other entities to interfere or block transactions between people is further reduced. Remember, this protocol was not set up to provide 'the fastest payment network in the world', the "performance" of the network to many people is a metric of its ability to resist government intervention, capital controls, inflation, financial institution intervention etc. (take your pick).
Another way of saying this is that the protocol would become more robust.


 
There were times in bitcoin's history where people speculated that if a single chip fab produced a single relatively good ASIC (and kept it for themselves) they would easily have over 50% of the hash rate. Thankfully with the introduction of the range of ASICs that we have now and the consequent increase in hash rate, bitcoin is more robust than ever (at least from a hashing perspective, it is debatable that pools have decreased its overall robustness/decentralisation).


 To be fair, I agree with this point that the scalability of bitcoin will not be directly improved necessarily by Intel manufacturing specific chips. But again this is an unfortunate side-effect of mining pools and there is still scope for other chip types to make an impact - for example a transaction versification on small, low powered devices can be improved.

That software looks pretty nice (and I have not encountered it before) so I really do mean no disrespect when I say I think its laughable that *you* think it's laughable that businesses are not using your, single contributor and relatively-unknown software vs. Core (CLI) wallet functions.
Whilst I am sure that some of the bigger or more technically competent businesses are using raw transactions, there is no way that you can say **all** businesses are. When regular (GUI) users and lots of businesses can't access the feature, I don't think you can argue that "it is implemented".

Example: They talk about "Reversible transactions" quite a bit. Really what they mean here is "reversible before first confirmation", which is already quite a difference from what they allude to.
This is deliberately deceptive because transactions have always been "reversible" to some extent. This could happen even after a confirmation or two (or 3 maybe!) if a miner releases a longer hidden chain they have been mining privately, performs a "selfish mining" attack, or simply was building upon a different chain tip than another miner. This is the reason that 6 confirmations are recommended when sending large amounts -- because transactions may be "reversed" (not included) in a new chain tip which is selected on most proof-of-work basis.
Now something *was* changed relative to the earlier mechanics of bitcoin; the addition of "Replace By Fee" (RBF). What used to happen was once a transaction was sent around the P2P network, nodes would see those inputs as "used" and then would not relay any subsequent attempts to use those same inputs (which would be "fraudulent double spends" according to the protocol). What this provided was a framework that the receiver could be "quite sure" that if he has seen the transaction, even if it has not been confirmed into a block, that it was probably good and would get picked up eventually in a block (many caveats apply here still but will leave them for now). This would typically be acceptable for a low value transaction, and lots of merchants did accept these, but you wouldn't let a man get on a plane with your diamonds you were selling without waiting for 6 confirmations (or more).
So what changed with RBF? Well now, in an opt-in way, senders can mark their transactions as "Replace-By-Fee enabled". This means that those transactions can be replaced by one with a higher fee and nodes **will** relay the second one. In this case, it becomes less clear which tx will confirm as some miners might operate different fee policies (a "rational" miner should take the second one with higher fee but you can't guarantee at this stage), but generally with an RBF transaction you should wait for a confirmation. RBF also is essentially letting you bid your way to a faster confirmation if your transaction is taking too long to confirm, so could be argued to be helping user security. However, it is also important to note that receivers (e.g. merchants) can see if a transaction has the RBF flag set and so *could* choose to delay release of goods/services longer for transactions marked as such vs. regular, non-RBF transactions.
So what do Bitcoin Cash and BTC therefore have in common? Transactions are "reversible" for up to ~6 blocks (or whatever confidence level you are happy with relative to payment amount).
In what way are they different? Nodes without an RBF policy *might* provide more certainty for unconfirmed transactions, but also they might not. It's difficult to say really.
In conclusion, I hope you can see, somewhat more objectively, how marketing this slight difference in mechanics as "has reversible transactions" is pretty sneaky (and probably not correct). There are some more 'issues' that I would take with it's objectivity and certainly would lead me to conclude that the article is either poorly researched or outright biased, either way causing me to dismiss it as something which I could use to further my own understanding on.

OK I agree that it's not an important question if "pull requests are only merged after a number of ACKs as a matter of principle". What my question then would be is what exactly constitutes a "number of ACKs"? Is this codified somewhere? Also over the years I have seen many PRs merged with, what to me, appears to be quite some numbers of NACKs from prominent developers.
From my standpoint it seems that those with commit access must therefore control the passageway and might be slightly more important than you are making out, but if there is a formally codified document of this process which invalidates that understanding then I would love to see it.

You jest, but I think at least connection-wise, we will see people in these kind of nations achieve fast connectivity relatively quickly in the future via their phones, or at least using the same tech that they use: of course it won't be cable connections, but wireless tech such as 4G/5G.
They surely won't waste money laying cable infrastructure.
Of course they won't be mining as you rightly point out.

Just a semantic correction, perhaps English is not your first language but there is a difference between: ...so that there could be "more circulation of bitcoins" and "more bitcoins in circulation". The second phraseology implies that the supply of coins would increase, which is incorrect.

Thanks for explaining but I still really don't understand this phraseology "adds progress" to the mining, perhaps it is an Americanism I am unfamiliar with?
Anyway, it sounds like you are saying that this creates the unintended consequence of a mini selfish mining (block withholding)-type incident/attack? By sending a slow-to-validate block, you are "removing 4 seconds" worth of your competitions hashing work, freezing them out of the game for the 4 seconds.
Can headers-first mining not be used yet to solve this (reduce from 4s to the millisecond range) without risking the so-called SPV wallets' security?
Whatever happened to the 'Blockchain Verification Flag' proposal/BIP? I think this might even have been one of yours. Was that not proposed to eliminate exactly this issue?
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:21:33
Most of the risk was usually from stale blocks rather than orphan blocks, but yes I agree. This is where the value of the transaction again comes into play.
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:53:40
The best word to describe bitcoin's anonymity profile is 'pseudonymous'. This model describes how users take on some form of ID (username, ID number etc.) which obscures their identity. This does not usually mean though, that the **actions** of that identity are obscured, and this is very obvious in bitcoin, where every transaction is broadcast publicly.
However, when using bitcoin, the pseudonymous identity (in bitcoin terms your 'address' [more specifically the public key or a hash of the pub key]) can be used to provide relatively strong obscurity providing certain practical steps are followed. For example, purchasing bitcoins using cash, and then utilising a wallet which pays change to a change address gives a good start at some level of "anonymity" when sending coins.

Well here i suppose is where we differ' I don't view a pre-planned hard fork upgrade as "split of the network to the massive detriment to all" so for me as an engineer, I view the HF as 'cleaner', with no downsides.
HF upgrade clan also include a modest block size increase and some of the hard fork wish list items. For me, this is the win-win scenario that should have been the obvious choice.

Nodes used to not relay a second transaction spending the same inputs, even if the second tx had a higher fee' it was simply "first seen". The only way to scam a merchant was to broadcast two transactions at the exact same instant and hope half the nodes in the whole network saw one and half the other, and then hope that the merchant only saw one and the other one was the one which got mined. Merchants could easily protect themselves, even for high value zero conf txs, just by running a few different nodes. This was changed by Peter Todd's Replace By Fee (crap) which made zero conf txs significantly less useful.

So do you not think miners will be using the relay network/FIBRE? I think  you are trying to attribute issues here to miners that simply don't exist (loss of revenue due to slow block exchange). They have already come up against and surpassed these issues long ago.
If you are trying to attribute these "issues" to full nodes then compact blocks can solve. In the UK unlimited 200Mb fibre broadband is like £50 a month. Doesn't seem out of reach to me for running a global token exchange network on.

Would you mind elaborating a little further on this please? Where exactly "are" the fees then? They are sent as part of the transaction but the miner does not include them when they mine the block?

@_date: 2016-07-03 22:10:21
It's quite comical that you believe yourself what you are saying. Don't you think if the code for block size (as you try to call now "base size") had been changed from 1000000 to 2000000 you could point me to it a little easier than 7 paragraphs of text? 
The reason you can't is because they simply have not done this, in fact, they've done almost everything else except doing this.
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:05:43
Please point to the hostility? If you think me stating that they have not increased the block size is "treating you with undue hostility" then, well I just feel sorry for you really. And "sorry for invading your safe space", I guess?
Anyway, if you would just take a look at [line 16]( of the code that you have linked to, you will be able to see how block size is maintained at 1000000 bytes. The same way that if I set up a wallet which makes transactions on the Litecoin network, then uses the bitcoin blockchain to link to those tx hashes to fit more on the bitcoin blockchain, I have not increased the bitcoin block size.
It is merely an accounting trick and the bit that annoys me most about it (because don't get me wrong, I am actually am in favour of this change), is that people pushing for it will not admit that it is not increasing the blocksize. Just say it! It does not increase the bitcoin maximum blocksize, but allows realisation of gains which are equivalent to increasing the blocksize.
People would spend a whole lot less of their time arguing about semantics if both sides could just admit what this was, and that is **not** increasing maximum block size.

Just because you repeat it does not make it so. Perhaps you could explain how in a little bit more detail for those of us trying to understand you?
Let's take an 8MB block for example, how would this affect a "smaller miner"? Miners can receive headers first and re-assemble blocks using transactions in the mem pool (compact blocks) so I don't think 'total block size' propagation can be the issue here, so what is it exactly?

Negative. You mean inflation.
During period of inflation, the value of a single unit of currency drops, so you need more units of that currency to make up the same (real world) value. Your loaf of bread goes from costing  £2 to costing £4.
If everyone were to try to sell GBP, and nobody wanted to buy it, people would be trying to sell cheaper and cheaper (you would get more £ for each bitcoin as a buyer) as sellers tried to undercut each other to find a buyer.

So, two types of node being discussed here it seems: 1) "Validating node" and 2) "mining node".
You posit that we will need data centres for validation nodes &gt;1MB. I would say - not so. In fact any desktop or laptop made in the last 4 or 5 years would be able to validate easily 8MB blocks (as long as certain provisions were made eg Sig Hash Ops limited). Indeed if we move to 20MB blocks or larger I would instantly purchase a dual CPU computer with 128GB RAM and some RAID storage which would be used only for a validation node. I would also pay straightaway the £2,000 cost to have 1GBit symmetric fibre cable laid to my premises and £160/month line rental for the line. I am not even a business and this setup would be overkill for such small blocks.
Just last month I purchase £800 i7 machine to upgrade my node after a few years of running on an ODROID C1 (which cost &lt;£50 and could still be run today if I wanted). These really are not prohibitive costs for actual users of the system. Could every user afford a "validating node"? No. *Should* every user be running a validating node? I don't believe so. I think even 100MB or larger blocks will not stop validating nodes being prohibitively expensive for businesses and hobbyists which will be enough.
Of "Mining nodes", well, how many of those do we have today? 20? 30? Lets say 50 to be safe. Do you really think a citizen from an LEDC with 1Mb internet connection is going to be running a bitcoin mining operation? Personally, I don't think so.
The only real constraints I can see for increasing max block size are the propagation through the GFW and also possibly some unknown political reasons.

So that all your BTC don't get stolen through having a wallet app on a rooted phone?
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:16:40
That script has finished now, with no luck :(
Is there any way you could modify it to use a local copy of my wallet.dat? If I first decrpt it using my known first password, then I am happy to let it run on my mac until is it cracked - although (using some calcs) I see that it could take like 3 years or something outrageous for a 10 dig pw... :(
What do you think; what would you do if it was you? I have 18 BTC in there btw...
Again, thanks for your help anyway.
Not sure it will help, but here is some more background:
  I use a pass manager called 1Password which is on my iPhone - this lets you generate passwords where you can decide the 'ingredients' - e.g. use 4 symbols and 4 numerals and length 10 (I think I had 3 symb and 3 numerals and length 10).  Then, you press a dial (looks like the bit on a safe that you can turn) and it cycles through passwords. 
  Usually, I generate one, hit save! and then copy it into the pass fields twice as per usual. Not sure how I managed to screw this up, although, it is very sensitive, and there is the risk that, if you enter the password, and don't first press save, then tap the dial, it will generate a new random pass, with no 'back' button! I have noticed this though and am sure that I always 'save' first...
This is why I don't understand how I could have messed it up...!? 
Also, just noticed on blockchain.info I have 'ip blocked due to too many requests' - this may conincide with the fact that terminal did not throw "no luck" as it appeared that it should - see 
Perhaps I need to see it run through on a local copy of my wallet, which has had the primary pass (encryption) stripped...?

@_date: 2013-12-30 10:39:26
Ok, but I don't agree that for bitcoin to succeed we need to change the definition of 'fiat money', or whatever you are inferring.
Also, I don't think you can take just "one line item" from the definition of something and claim that BTC meets that definition because it conforms to that one line. That's just wrong, IMO. And I'm sure everyone on this forum and in the whole field of economics would disagree with you that BTC is fiat... Jus' saying.

Create a Blockchain.info account, send the BTC to it. Then go:
1) receive coins
2) copy a receive address you have setup (you can generate a new address for this if you like)
3) now click "send coins"
4) in the bar on the left click "shared send"
5) do a shared send of all of your coins to another of your own addresses. 
Voila, all your 'grey' coins will be gone - you can check the effectiveness of this using the button that says "taint analysis"

Well, using a deterministic wallet (for example Bitcoin Armory or Electrum) means a single backup at the new wallet generation stage will suffice for the lifetime of the user.
Digital backups can be encrypted using PGP (or even more simply 7zip using AES) and then safely uploaded to cloud/backup locations.
Paper backups (whether password protected (BIP 38 I think)) or unencrypted can be stored in a home or professional safe or safety deposit box.
Armory lets you create m of n backups. This means you need 'm' of the total 'n' fragments of a backup file to be able to restore the whole wallet. For example, a 3 of 5 backup would require 3 of the 5 fragments to restore. This means you can "safely" give backups of your wallet to trusted (but preferably unrelated) persons, probably not telling them who holds the other fragments...
These are only a few of the options available currently. It is really up to the user to find ingenious ways to protect his wallet now. I'm sure paid services will begin to arrive soon though if you are still worried about this...
If you want help with one of the above methods, just ask! ;)

Now I understand.  Thanks. I have heard of this being called the birthday problem before somewhere, so think I will have to pull the wikipedia on that at some point later.
Ok so last question I promise! If I find the vanity address I am after (over 1,000,000 now), can I use the private key for that address, as the seed for a deterministic wallet in armoury (as mentioned by bitbutter above  because that would be pretty cool if I could.
Again, thanks for your help!
@_date: 2013-10-29 09:42:23
OK so, I have never said (neither does the linked image) that you have to "cycle through 2^256 possibilites to get what you want" as you seem to think that I have said. So I am not sure why you think I have said this...?
I am also well aware of the address space of bitcoin.
It is simply a nice illustration relating to the laws of thermodynamics, showing how large the number 2^256 actually is which is somthing most non-cryptographers have no real grasp of, whilst at the same time implying that brute force hashing SHA256 is not going to be technically feasable with today's hardware.
What kind of "major vulnerability" do you think OP is alluding to then, if not a lapse in the cryptographic protocols which secure the network, especially as he asked:
"I wonder what if SHA256 gets broken in 5 years? Is it possible that bitcoin upgrades to a better and newer encryption method which will be unbreakable at the time? What about the speculation of quantum computers?"
I think my question answered both of these points pretty completely.
Perhaps you should explain what you are confused about?

You can make your own BIP anywhere you like. If you want to use those guys' private BIP system you need their permission, that's the way decentralised systems work. If you have a controversial BIP you probably shouldn't expect it to be permitted: for example if I request a BIP for code which inverted the block subsidy at next halving in order to inflate the monetary supply (a la jstolfi), then I can probably expect it to be rejected, by that BIP committee, as it does not align with their idea of Bitcoin. Doesn't mean I can't try and write the code, get people to review and run it though.

It's actually completely different. They have just created the product and given most of it to themselves. They are then trying to get everyone else to use it, then they will be comparatively rich...
Bitcoin protocol was created (free) and then equal chance given to anyone who wanted to donate computing power (or initially just anyone who used the client - reward for usage of the protocol) which earned them coins.
Most likely, if Satoshi had created Bitcoin, given himself a balance of 2 million coins, and then set a limit of only 500,000 more coins ever to be mined, nobody would be using Bitcoin.

If you are truely paranoid you can always create the keypair (and corresponding address) by hand. All you need to do is:
1) Create a secp256k1 public key from a private key
2) Perform SHA-256 hash(ing)
3) Perform RIPEMD-160 hash(ing)
4) Convert the final value into Base 58
Better get your calculator out, and don't forget not to make any mistakes or else the coins will forever be irretrieveable!

So I have a blockchain.info wallet, with one address with about 1 BTC in it. 
Then I have imported all my other addresses as ' watch only' (stored in armory really) into blockchain.info, so that I can keep track of the balances.
If I need to spend more that day, I just whizz a few over to the blockchain.info "hot" address.
Just remember, if using blockchain.info app to send bitcoins, you have to use the arrows up the top to change from "any address" to select to send from your "hot" address (an address label might come in handy here!)
This lets me see my total balance all the time, but I can only lose up to 1BTC at any one time (unless I'm very unlucky).
Hope this helps you.
By the way, if you have quite a few bitcoins, I would recommend buying a dedicated offline armory netbook for extra security.

Basically, at my home desktop I would like to use the Bitcoin-QT client, but outside that I like the access Blockchain.info gives me. Also, I really dont want to have multiple wallets, for better or worse, I would just like one...
Do you think that's a good enough reason? Or conversely, if you think there would be an advantage to having two wallets please let me know, I am genuinely interested to learn what I can about this... :) thanks

I think you have your bubble tinted glasses on pal. BTC has risen from pennies to £300 over the period of a few weeks. It doesnt feel like a bubble to me.
If the price had been 1$, then risen to $10 and fallen to $6 would you still be calling it a bubble, I think not... And these prices did once exist. I think some people like you just let the big numbers go to their heads and it stops them seeing the truth for what it is

It's just a public key for receiving funds. You can easily mix them using coin join or shared sending if you want to.

What you fail to realise is that the security is not provided by the "number of confirmations" (in either coin). It is actually provided by the total work done; after 10 minutes of hashing, you are reasonably secure, after 60 you are very secure. It doesn't matter if this is 1,6 or 266 confirmations. 
Litecoin advocates seem to miss this basic understanding frequently.
Just to clarify further, bitcoin nodes will not accept (and propagate) a transaction involving inputs that have already been broadcast to them (and are now 'spent' but not 'confirmed'). This is why as you must have heard before it is perfectly safe to accept a zero confirmation transaction for a cup of coffee.
The hashing power, timing and luck required to pull this off does not make it viable an attacker would use it for low value transactions; the computing power would be better spent productively.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:16:40

There are three main considerations to take when calculating a fee for a bitcoin transaction (rough rules):
1) the age of the coins; older coins do not require a fee, whereas 'hot' coins may require a fee.
2) the size of the transaction; nope, not the value/number of the coins being moved, But the size of the text file needed to "write the transaction down" to send to the miners for verification; to verify a 'larger' transaction (many inputs/many outputs) is more 'costly'. For example, if I send you 1 BTC from my wallet, this could be [100x0.01BTC inputs &gt;&gt; 1BTC output] (a large transaction) or simply [1BTC input &gt;&gt; 1 BTC] output (a smaller transaction)
3) the speed you want the coins to move; faster = requires fee. Don't care about speed (usually only a few hours still) then can send without fee.
Note, this is all possible using certain wallets. I have no experience with places like coin base and it's possible that they artificially impose fees for all transactions either to make a little money theirselves or else to ensure that their users get an apparently smooth and fast experience...

Use transfer wise! (my personal referral link  )
Basically they let you send from GBP to any other currency for excellent exchange rates (check it if you like) and for super cheap fees. Basically they have a pool of funds and just 'swap' your with someone who is trying to send euros somewhere, but is all happens very fast (like 20 mins usually) so they avoid bank charges! Cool!
As poster below said, you can send euros directly to MtGox Polish bank account and presto! 
Also, is generally an awesome service, I have had zero problems with it ever!

Well I am verified at MtGox, so what I do is use transferwise (  )  to send GBP to the polish MtGox account as Euros. This service is far cheaper than banks, even if you opt for the faster payments system (arrives by 6pm that day if you order before 13:00 that day)...
If you are not verified at MtGox, I would use again transferwise but sending GBP to euros to your account on Bitcoin-24.com, as they do not require registration.
Transferwise let's you pay via bank transfer or debit card (if its less than £2000).
MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE YOUR UNIQUE PAYMENT REFERENCE MTGOX/BITCOIN-24 GIVE YOU IN YOUR PAYMENT WHEN USING TRANSFERWISE, OTHERWISE THESE EXCHANGES WILL NOT KNOW WHOSE ACCOUNT TO PUT THE MONEY IN!!
Hope this helps, message me if you want more help/further instructions!

I think you might be exaggerating by saying "wait forever" but I suppose that depends on the speed of your internet connection; I guess it could take forever though under some circumstances.
If you simply want to send or receive some BTC then there is of course absolutely tzero requirement to use any of the so-called 'thick' clients which require (currently) the whole blockchain (or in the future only all headers). However, if you understand bitcoin at all, you will realise that the marvel and power behind the protocol is actually the blockchain itself. And the fact that many (unrelated and decentralised) entities own and verify matching copies of it.
The blockchain is what gives bitcoin its trustless, un-cheatable, publicly-verifiable-by-all characteristics and really what sets it apart from all other currencies and stores of wealth that have ever existed before. For this reason alone, I believe as many people as possible should attempt to hold a full copy of the Blockchain, as that is where the power lies.
Of course as mentioned, running a client which utilises a local copy of the Blockchain also provides unparalleled security.
I will concede thought that many developing nations may not have internet connections suitable (currently) to sync the blockchain in a reasonable amount of time, I'm including lots of the US in that bracket too! And for this  reason many 'thin' clients exist and can be used. But holding the Blockchain is where it's at! ;)
@_date: 2013-08-02 10:56:51
Yes, but inthis situation, as some leave the network, the profitability for the others increases, which will reduce the effect.
I think that this would soften any mass exodus of hashing power, to well below the levels described by OP, but perhaps we shoudl not reply on this alone...
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:02:32
Lots of people use two factor authentication on blockchain.info (and similar) but fail to realise that their wallet.dat backup file (which you can choose to have emailed to you or whatever) is NOT protected by your 2FA. That is simply a site login mech.
Basically, you can have 2FA, second password, and still your simple wallet.dat can be cracked from a backup you have somewhere, with the simple password you chose as you thought the backup was protected by 2FA or whatever.
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:13:49
Ok, well once you are sure that you have sufficient backups to be able to restore your wallet, should everythign go tits-up (which there is no reason it should), you can go [here]( to download the "testing" (latest) branch of [Armory (0.89.99.10)]( which works with Mavericks, on some systems. (and should amongst other things use a bit less RAM I think).

Encrypting it does generate a new list of change (hidden) addresses, so after you encrypt, you should immediately backup.
By default, using Bitcoin-QT, hidden, receiving, change addresses are generated in groups of 100. For this reason you (theoretically) only need to backup wallet.dat every 100 transactions (less to be sure).
However, the moment you encrypt you wallet, remaining change addresses are purged and a new set are generated - the next transaction will use an address which was not included in the unencrypted backup (unless advanced "coin control" is utilised, and if you knew about that in Bitcoin-QT then you wouldn't need this explanation)...
Hope this helps

Of course he is allowed to speak from above; the SEPA banking system *is* better (for the consumer) than the US mess, there is simply no question about it.
It is not simply "throwing acronyms around", and by saying this you in fact make yourself appear to be quite naïve, or stupid. Perhaps visit the Wikipedia page for SEPA so that you can learn something about it before commenting next time.

Well incidentally it is no skin off my chest either. I guess I will agree, that in OP's (IMO incorrect/made up) definition of fiat money, perhaps BTC conforms.

Hey, did you ever think what a credit card actually does? They provide a way for you to spend your currency (I presume your is dollars) which brings with it insurance and security, Spending money on a credit card is certainly not the same as spending irreversible currency, it's simply that the equivalent service does not yet exist for bitcoin yet

Ok we if you really want argue, now we have determined your timeline, "long term"... And now we have a deflationary currency in the long term, you seem to imply in the latter half of your (2x) previous statement that this means it would be (inherently) unstable and unusable as a currency.
My question(s) to you would be: do you have any evidence for this (which isn't simply rhetoric)?
Why do you think/believe this?
Can you provide any examples where a deflationary currency has been used and has failed in this way?
I am only asking questions; if you can't answer them that isn't my fault, so please refrain from aggression, if possible
@_date: 2013-09-21 19:37:49
I love this analogy, but would argue one point. I think the term "proof-of-work" really stems from the mining, or to use your analogy the puzzle-solving strategy used: in bitcoin mining at a basic level, a set of transactions are bundled and then a nonce added, which is then hashed. If this doesn't produce the required answer (complete the puzzle shape needed) then the nonce is incremented by one. This would be equivalent to only changing a single puzzle piece at a time.
Whilst technically it is possible for a bitcoin miner or a shape-solver to find the solution on the first guess, it is made statistically less likely by the difficulty being increased (perhaps this would be a larger puzzle in your analogy). The net result of this is that on average a higher difficulty should require more guesses to get right, therefore someone who solves it, should statistically have made a larger number of guesses, which is why it can be termed proof-of-work.
I solved a very difficult puzzle and it *must* have taken a long time/many guesses which is acting as 'proof' of my work, or in the bitcoin world proof of my contribution of hashing power to the network - without which I *could not* have solved the problem.
Although, as I said, technically I could perform a single hash by hand tomorrow for fun and happen to find an acceptable hash, faster than the whole 1,000,000,000,000,000 hashes the rest of the network does every second right now, although I think you will appreciate that this is probably unlikely...
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:58:08
To be fair your way would work out as a form of cost-price averaging, which is reasonably solid if you don't have any other opinion on what will happen... :)

I would reccomend this guide:
For the sake of 20k, buying a seperate 100$ netbook, as a dedicated bitcoin storage walelt is worth it (in my eyes).

Those people have more coins because they "risked" their computing resources on something which have one day been worth zero, or worth 'more than it was then'. (Also this "cost" them money in form of hardware and resources [electricity])...
This is just he same as people who "risked" their hard earned cash on amazon stocks back in 1997 (or whenever) now have something worth quite a bit more.
Risk. Reward.
If there was no risk, everyone would have invested and we would have equal distribution, proportional to wealth/disposable income. But there was a risk and they took it; seems fair to me...

I personally think you made a pretty decent gamble, seeing as you wanted to gamble it! ;)
The non-Chinese BTC exchanges seem to be finding their feet now much more without being pegged to the (inevitably falling) Chinese prices.
I hope you invested with a timescale which will give you enough time for the price to rise again, because IMO that is all it needs, time. Time to stabilise. Time for the Chinese coins to be moved out of the exchanges and absorbed elsewhere. All Chinese with coins want to sell right now, and get their fiat back, that's understandable. All these extra coins have to go somewhere.
Just wait till May '14, I hope you can survive that long without needing to "cash out" (gah I hate that phrase) at a loss

I bet he still has some bitcoins though, and if he had never have bought that pizza, they might not be worth ANYTHING today (media exposure was very good for bitcoin)...Now BECAUSE of his initial purchase (remember, only worth $15 or whatever at the time) his remaining BTC is worth much more. It's a win:win situation for him! Pizza + increased wealth; who wouldn't want that?
He can probably afford to buy two more pizzas now ;) Can't say that about your devauing fiat horde can you now...

Nope, I mean a coinbase block. Coinbase in bitcoin terminology (before the website came along) refers to what was originally termed the block creation fee, but what most people now refer to as "block reward".
This is the number of "freshly minted coins" a miner get for successfully solving a new block.
Coinbase transactions are unique, as the miner must wait for 120 confirmations (120 new solved blocks built on top of their block) before the coins are spendable.  This prevents problems of redistributing coins should their block be orphaned.
See article 
So no , I mean a coinbase block. After the last block is generated for which there is a coinbase reward (and it will be mined and blocks will continue to be mined after that as well) the monetary supply becomes deflationary, as no new money at all is created (or can be). Until that point though, the amount of "new money created" or inflation, is decreasing, as the coinbase (block reward) halves every 210000 blocks.
Hope you understand my point now. :)

A helpful user sent me a script with exactly this in a whole ago, I am not at home right now but will try to remember to copy a link to it here when I get back home.
Edit: Found it in my PMs. His name was Fluidic Tapestry, very helpful guy.
Edit 2: just remembered that this script was for my second password... Depending on how computer literate you may be able to recode for primary password?!
The script is here: 
Basically, you download the file, save as a Ruby script, edit the appropriate bits and run it.
Since Blockchain.info changed their login routine (to make it safer) you need to do one additional thing: first, try to login to Blockchain.info using your identifier on the computer you are going to run the script from. This prompts the email being sent to your email address from Blockchain.info to confirm it is really you at that ip trying to log on. Next, click the link in the email to login to Blockchain.info. Leave that Internet window open (minimised?) in the background. It doesn't not matter that you do not know the password at this stage...
Then run the ruby script.
You have to do the above step as the script actually try's the live Blockchain.info site (not a local wallet file), so if you don't verify your IP address using the email confirmation it just rejects every attempt.

You can download Tor, register an account with Silk Road, send a test amount to your account there, if successful send your entire balance there.
Wait a day or two, generate a new receive address in your 'regular' wallet, and withdraw the coins from Silk Road to it. 
Free (no mixing fee) fresh coins, nothing illegal (I don't think) done, Silk Road used only as a mixer.
Pm me if you want the Silk Road address or any other details

I would be happy to provide feedback
@_date: 2013-04-20 08:59:04
It is good to think of transaction fees more like 'bids'.
What you are doing with a transaction fee, is bidding (relative to the size your transaction takes up in bytes, which is dependant on number of input and output addresses, NOT the number of bitcoins that are being sent) for your transaction to be included in the next block - a "faster" payment.
As the number of transactions per time increase, there should naturally be more 'bidding' to have any transaction included in a block sooner. If you don't mind how long it will take to transfer, bid lower. For higher priority, bid higher.
It is my understanding that developers are attempting to implement (into Bitcoin-QT client at least) some functionality which will allow people to roughly see what level of fee (bid) will have there transaction processed in a certain amount of time, although any such mechanism will be based only on recent historical transactions and would never be able to be 100% accurate.
Hope this helps.
