"At this moment I was euphoric".   
Dude, its just a decentralized exchange. No need to cream your pants over it. Did you wear your fedora while you were typing out this thread?

Wouldn't it be great if Friday is another pump day like last week?

Let's dump this shit into the 6k range. Cheaper bitcoin is better.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:07:36
Wahh, too bad. How about you invest in a traditional market then where you have to wait five years to maybe make 50% on your initial investment?
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:48:50
I have a feeling there's going to be a price rise with it being pay day and all.

I wouldn't recommend putting your entire savings in Bitcoin unless you enjoy seeing hundreds or thousands of dollars wiped out randomly. Just DCA.
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:58:57
Not upset at all, may buy more if the price drops lower.
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:47:47
Please don't do this, and don't encourage anyone else to do this. Yes, I think theres a very low chance Bitcoin will completely die out. But anything you put in Bitcoin should be realized as a potential loss. Meaning, you can lose it tomorrow and not sweat over it. If it goes up, great. Otherwise, keep your savings in a regular savings account and allocate a bit of it to investments.

I didn't reply mostly because you spouted the same hopium that every other religious believer brings up. 
I fail to see how I am trolling, and I think your hyperbole is incredibly annoying. Are you 14 or something? Did I hurt your feelings by not being a 100% bitcoin zealot? Note that I am not saying that bitcoin isn't a valid investment. I actually have a decent amount invested. My point was directed more towards the community and its handling of criticism towards bitcoin. And here you are of course demonstrating my point.

Wow, I'm not at all surprised I got so many examples of this fanaticism in my own thread. Thanks for the material guys. I like how almost everyone who responded felt personally attacked instead of responding logically to my OP (although there were a few of you here who did).   
Like I said, I like Bitcoin and think it could be a good investment but this hyper-libertarian nonsense is only going to drive people further away.

Who says I'm emotional? I'm happy its going to goblin town.
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:13:30
Am I wrong in thinking that regulation is the antithesis to what the community wants?

Nice! I was just asking yesterday if the prices will dip below 10k and they did. I'm a new time investor and because of these dips I've brought myself up to an initial goal of 0.1 BTC. Hope to get to 0.2 by the end of the year, but I'm going to slow my DCA because I have what I need in bitcoin for the moment.
@_date: 2019-10-12 21:11:49
Or you can just put down the small amount of cash for a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:21:03
Yeah sorry guys but this is going to goblin town overnight/tomorrow morning. See you there when I wake up.
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:55:58
I agree with you. I think some of the bitcoin community are highly delusional and extremely zealous. Just look at the people who believed we were going to rise to 16k this month after a massive drop. I do believe we will continue rising at some point, but at a slower pace as institutions continue to investment. I don't foresee a million dollar bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:29:27
We are in a bear market so long as we are under the 200 daily MA.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:04:36
Whats there to be depressed about it? Are you a day trader who only makes 100x positions on Bitmex? If not, just relax. At the very least you get some interesting drama when the price fluctuates so much.
@_date: 2019-09-10 02:22:39
Is there a strategy out there to use margin trading (e.g. Bitmex) for DCA? For instance, suppose there's a dip and I decide to go in long for a small amount at something like 5x leverage to reduce my risk. The price goes up, I cash out and what I earn is my DCA. Then there is no upfront cost for me except the small amount of BTC I risked out of my stack. Has anyone tried this?
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:43:35
Took all my money off Bitmex, transferred it back to my online wallet.   
Bought a trezor.   
Once tomorrow's eTransfer clears (\*sigh\*, bank limits) I plan to complete my order of 0.5 bitcoin. Just hope the price doesn't bounce too high in the meantime. |  
And then, HODL till I die.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:05:43
I hope so, because this is the first time I've put coin on BitMex.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:55:41
There's a golden cross forming on the MACD. I think we may see a bump.
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:35:11
So are we in a bear market now or what? I bought in completely at 8.4k, half a bitcoin? Should I cash out and wait for a bigger dump?
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:00:08
At least you didn't buy .5 btc at 8500 like I did. But still, I haven't lost much.
@_date: 2019-09-26 02:57:02
I bought 0.5 bitcoin at about 8.4 to 8.5k. Kind of wondering if I should've waited for the next dip. Oh well, gonna find out soon enough.  
And hackers sorry, I use a hardware wallet now.
