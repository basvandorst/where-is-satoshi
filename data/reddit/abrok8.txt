Yes. The rule would probably be that there is space for (lets say) 100 votes in one block to keep it small.

Thank you. Will do that. Looked already at decred, but it was still a bit different.

A vote is weighted by the amount of coins the voter controls.
Ok I probably unterstand what you mean. The chain with most work should win the votes. You could for example multiply the voting weight of a block with its difficulty. But I thing this would not even be needed because hidden mining is not possible.

Didn't get that  one completly. But I would say the weight of a block is the sum of the voteweights it contains. Doesn't matter wether d = chain\_depth or not.
@_date: 2019-01-13 13:17:31
Yes that is basically the idea. Let me formulate:
block\_vote\_weighted\_difficulty\[d\] = sum\_of\_top100\_coins\_voted\_for\_block\[d-1\] / sum\_of\_existing\_coins \* block\_difficulty\[d-1\];
chain\_vote\_weighted\_difficulty = sum of block\_vote\_weighted\_difficulty\[0..n\]
where d is the block number and n is the chain depth(number of blocks in that chain.)

The winning chain is the chainwith the most voting weight. The voting weight of a chain is the sum of the weight included in each block of that chain.
Yes blocks are still found by proof of work. The longest chain will still be the winner in almost all cases because more blocks -&gt; more voting weights.

Everyone can sign (vote for) the block. But the miner can only include maximum 100 votes in the block. He will select the 100 most weighted votes out of the mempool to make sure his chain is valid.

Good points. 


But that is only possible if the coin holder the miner colludes with has much more then 50% voting power, right? Otherwise the honest chain will accumulate weight much more quickly. Indirectly the weight of a chain can be calculated by hashpower\*votingpower.


True, but at least there are ways of hiding your ip.




I dont think a hot wallet is technically needed.
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:52:05
I guess 100 votes = ~6 kb.
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:14:29
I would disagree on the DDoS argument. Votes are very small and mempools could discard votes with a small weight. That could even be a rule in the protocol.
Hot wallets are indeed a problem I thought about too. I am not an expert in cryptography, but I could imagine that this might be a solvable problem. Aren't there solutions for this problem already worked on for POS coins?

If they own more then 50% of all bitcoins they surely dont want bitcoin to die. I am not so sure about miners who sold their bitcoins anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:54:10
Yes thats why we would only include top 100 (or some other numer) votes.
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:29:53
They can not control much. They just signal that they saw the block, to prevent hidden mining. If some of them dont sign, the next heaviest vote is included in the block. In case of a fork bigger voters have more say then less big voters, like in POS. But in case of a fork, the chain with half the hashpower needs twice as much votingweight per block to equal the chain weight.
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:42:36
Can you give a more specific example? I can not see a situation where a miner can profit from not selecting the most 100 weighted votes. If he would not he would lose his mining reward because another miner would mine a block with more weight.

What do you mean? What is OP?
Voters and miners collectively decide which chain is valid. Voters provide the votes and miners have to include them in their blocks. The valid chain is the chain with most weight. And chain weight can basically calculated by hashower\*votingweight\_per\_block.
