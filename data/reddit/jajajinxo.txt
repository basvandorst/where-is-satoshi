It's funny how much FUD is being drawn out based on the stupidity of these people.  I'm sorry but people need to understand how to secure their assets and understand they pose huge risk when they take short cuts such as this.

Isn't the google news bullish for BTC, people rarely promote bitcoin off ads, the altcoins bring down the legitimacy of BTC, and this helps kill off more BTC competitors.

TA or fundamentals? Or pure guess and in that case, thanks for being useless.

Money finally transferred into GDAX, bought .5 at 8.3k, kind of mad I missed the bottom this morning.  Will watch the next few days see how it goes, I want to buy before the weekend asian pump.  Thiel is also bullish on BTC.

I'm betting it'll stay in the 8.5k-9.5k range until then.  I have futures contracts that I want to convert into real coin, so the lower the better for me, but it doesn't matter as my exposure will be the same.

Haha SAME, should've wired.

I don't believe in TA either, but the death and golden cross are held in high regard to our friends that preach this science, which can be a self fulfilling fate.

Dude also invests in IBM, I think this mentality on the future is a bit off, gotta remember he's from Omaha and old AF.

Exactly, I hope this investor loses his money and learns his lesson, and watches in a few year remembering never to give up so easy again. We need strong soldiers in our fight, not these weaklings.

It'll be okay my friend, this is FUD, BTC would be way below if anything that serious had happened. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:11:08
About 4-5 days from the death cross (50 day and 200 day moving average cross).  Hopefully it's short lived with a rally onto a golden cross and we GO FUCKING MOON BOUND BOISSSSSSSS..

My personal take on what is happening, is all the alt coiner whales are exchanging to BTC and then cashing out to FIAT.  We need all the altcoins to fail before we start to trend up again.

reasoning, or random guess?

this is an excellent dip buy from a technical aspect if you're bullish, it'll attract to the 200 SMA.

Hasn't come yet a few more days. I think itll sell off quickly and bounce harder then your mom riding a midget.

This is excellent, all these pussy short term investors crying when BTC is below 8k, sorry you bought at ATHs, and you all of sudden think itll get killed off by the system it's seeking to replace.  Why did you make your purchase in the first place? The short sightedness of people in general is depressing, but the lower they sink the more I buy.
