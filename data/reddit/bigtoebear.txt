The conservative government in canada doesn't really put any thoughts into things like that.  They just like to use words like terrorism and money laundering.  They wouldn't have any idea about how they work, and if they feel they can't control it, they aren't going to like it.

It would already be tracked because all the exchanges report transactions over $10k anyway, and the banks would be reporting it to, so each 10K transaction gets two reports.

who knows, our dear leader marries cats.  Yes, this is true, he has had cat weddings and even dresses his cats up.  He wrote a book about hockey.  He is our fearless leader.
The conservatives are good at drawing attention to something just to take it away from something else.
They have committed electoral fraud, bribed senators to cover up stuff, and then covered up the bribe with more shenanigans.
My point is, bitcoin is a good distraction for a government with no morals.  A government that actually tried to tell us that if we didn't want police to look at all our internet traffic then we must be child pornographers.

Bitcoin doesn't need average joe schmoe.  Only exceptional people are interested in bitcoin.

but wouldn't the block with more transactions be the longer chain, causing the one with less transactions to be orphaned?

I don't know about where you live, but in my neck of the woods I would say there has been at least a dozen times in the last year that I went shopping and the whole town had "sorry debit/credit machines not working" on the doors of all the stores.

The country formerly known as canada.  We prefer to go with Harperland, or Alberta now.

we consistently have terrible governments in Canada, 38% of the vote wins a party a majority, a majority gives the government 100% of the power in parliament.  They use party whips heavily so what the prime minister says goes, no matter what.
There is a sham of a senate, but they are appointed by the PM so calling canada a "democracy" seems like a bit of an inside joke, but only the politicians laugh.

Canada is a leader is smugness.
There is nothing, and I mean nothing to stop this government.  $90k bribes to senators, nobody cares.  Possible electoral fraud? They'll just change the election laws.  I'm not even joking.  They got 38% of the vote last election, it gives them 100% of the power, nothing can stop them.  
The investigations into electoral fraud were too much for them, so they are getting rid of the independent head of elections canada and replacing him with one appointed by the prime minister.  Not even any public consultation, debate on the subject rushed through, the bill will pass, and the extremely partisan senate that is appointed by the PM will pass it there too.
I would laugh if it wasn't so sad.
Edit: Just to be sure I didn't make it sound like the 90k bribe was to get a bill passed (the prime minister would have just kicked the senator out of the party if he didn't vote right), it was a bribe to keep him quiet about his campaign fundraising on senate (taxpayer) time billing the senate for campaign type expenses, and other miscellaneous third world type corruption.

perhaps put a little more than zero effort in?

Nothing is ever what it looks like with the government of Canada.  They are masters of smoke and mirrors.

the Canadian government is a joke.
This specific government is suffering from one terrible bout of groupthink, it is going on a decade now.

The results make me think no effort is being applied.
Are you saying that you are from the government?

So there were no transactions over $10k then, meaning that it's all a waste of time?
I am talking about the government here, the same government that thinks the best way to fight their own electoral fraud is to take the power away from the independent guy and give it to a guy who answers to the PM.
This is a government that isn't looking to stop money laundering, it is trying to divert attention away from it's own money laundering. (why was it not through fintrac that we found out about the $90k cheque?)  They obviously aren't doing their job, because that 90k cheque went from a personal cheque account to a senators account.  If anything should set off some alarms, I am thinking it is that.
