This is correct, we do use a hybrid of LTC and BTC for hedging on the backend. We do plan on making more cryptocurrencies native, as the synthetic currencies were easy to roll out. If you have any other questions or feedback, feel free to PM or leave a reply here. Thanks :) -Ryan

hey we are expanding our banking regions slowly and depends on our banking partners. It is currently not on our roadmap to expand to other countries, some of which may need it more unfortunately. The app is available to download globally where they can deposit/withdraw native cryptocurrencies and invest in synthetic (if they so choose), but yes, it would be awesome if all countries had at least one on or off ramp. Thanks for writing a reply! -Ryan
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:03:49
Sure. Can you please DM me your email or phone that is associated with your Abra wallet? I can take a look. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:26:57
We may add more cards, but it may not be a direct integration (more-so third party). I can tell you that the restriction rate is much, much lower than 60%. Each platform has their own security protocols. However, we are working on improving ours.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:33:15
Hi yes, of course you can. Please PM me your Abra associated email or phone number.
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-06 06:46:30
Sorry for the late reply, was doing errands. We are based in California, so it's a bit late but I'll try to answer what I can tonight.
We use custom derivation paths, so I'll have to take a look where your funds are located. Feel free to PM me your Abra associated email or phone number so I can take a look.
I am customer ops, so I'm not an engineer, so I apologize if my info is poor or less educated.

Hi What's the part where you think it's way too good to be true?
Trust is paramount in crypto - everyone should agree with that. If Abra suddenly disappears, then obviously there will be a problem and we are aware of that. We're looking to shift to 2 of 3 so we can use an Oracle to sign transactions IF we were to disappear. However, Abra is doing well and we're actively working towards making sure our users will be able to get funds off whenever (using 2 of 3).
Currently they would be locked in contracts.
Any other questions?

Hey again our CEO, Bill Barhydt will be doing an AMA. You are very welcome to ask him this question. I believe he's scheduled for an AMA on 2/14 2pm PST. He will be answering all the technical questions. I just do customer operations, so I'm not all that savvy. Thanks!! -Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:46:18
Hi if you sign up for early access, there will be zero fees for all of 2019.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:41:32
Hey just replied to your DM! Thanks!! -Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:20:20
Hi I'm not sure how non-custodial is suspicious. We do not hold user funds.
We're simply enacting smart contracts. We simply hedge away our risk in real time.
More info here:
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:26:10
Hi again! I'm definitely not Mr. Abra, I just work here :P
We will provide further updates after the product rolls out regarding fees in terms of communication.
Feel free to message me or reply if you have any other follow up questions. Thanks!!
-Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:43:10
Hi We cannot promise we will NEVER ask for KYC under those circumstances, but it's extremely rare for us to do so. Even then, if your on-ramp is BTC, then you invest in our synthetic stocks/ETFs, etc, you can simply convert it back to BTC and withdraw. These funds are 100% yours. Remember - we are not an exchange. We are a non-custodial wallet.
We wouldn't ask for KYC simply because a user is a whale.
KYC is used for adding other integrations (banks, credit cards, wires). However, there can be times (again, extremely rare) where we ask for KYC if a user only used crypto deposits/withdrawals. 
Hope that answers your inquiry,
Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:43:36
Hi we do have KYC. However, you are more than welcome to fund your wallet with BTC, LTC, BCH and soon ETH. These on-ramps do not require KYC. If you used banks/credit cards, yes, there will be KYC.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:48:15
Hi We do want to work on making as many coins native as possible, but a lot of our resources are working on our stock/ETF/index roll out. So, we may look into this in the future, but we are a bit preoccupied with this launch. Thanks!! -Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:28:45
Hi We have a proprietary hedging system. Users are in full control of their funds, but yes, there would be some risk since we're the only one managing these smart contracts. We're also working towards 2 of 3 using an Oracle with a separate price feed.
We are not a custodian of the user funds, it's BTC on the backend. I can't go too deep into the way our smart contracts work, but we will look to release a white paper later.
We do not use USDT.
Also, the contracts are settled on the blockchain. We'll look to produce more content around this.
Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:42:16
Hey! This is a great question. Ultimately it is up to how AMEX charges their cards. We only facilitate the transactions. AMEX has a multitude of card programs. If it's a third party issued card, it may be charged as a cash advance and if it's directly issued, it should be a normal purchase. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:50:14
Hi there! Where did you see those transfer fees? I've never ever seen anything even close to that. Please let me know! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:00:19
Hi !
Please check out a few of the press releases
I am not sure which official documents you'd be requesting. I simply do customer ops, so my apologies if I'm misinformed.
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:27:46
This is true. I'll ask the people in Abra who would know more. Definitely don't want to spew false promises. But we do care about fees, both for us as well as our users. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 04:38:25
We are not going to change our decision. We have security protocols. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:34:19
Hah, thank you, thank you. I as well as Abra appreciate it.
I will reach out tomorrow and let you know.
Thank you!!
Team Abra 
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:17:50
Anytime! Always glad to answer questions. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:01:06
Hi there! We are looking at this possibility, but likely won't happen soon.
Thank you for the feedback!
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:48:56
SegWit could be in the coming months. No date though.
We do have safe practices.
1. Do not connect to a public WiFi or any WiFi you do not trust.
2. Create a complicated lock screen code or 2FA method to get into your phone.
3. Do not use custom keyboards (especially those that save what you type).
4. Do not run risky apps or visit risky sites.
5. Disable or turn off all hardware ports.
6. Keep your phone with you and within sight of course.
Any other questions?
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:59:24
For ACH:
1-2K daily
2-4k weekly
4-8k monthly
For wires:
2-30k per day
200 daily
1000 monthly
All values in USD. We are working on increasing AMEX and ACH limits.
There are no BTC limits for depositing and withdrawing.
Currently we have around a 1BTC exchange limit (rolling 24hrs)
An example : purchasing ETH, you would only be able to obtain an ETH balance equivalent to around 1BTC currently within 24hrs.
Let me know if you have any other questions! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:46:23
We are global, but only two countries at this time have bank support - the US and Philippines. We plan to change that, but no longer sure of our time line for other countries. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:41:09
Hi again mcbem,
We do not have access to all of that information nor would we ask for that. We do not disclose the reasoning for our restrictions as referenced in my post to the OP here. We do not ask for credit score either. We simply have security protocols which will restrict users for reasons which we will not disclose. 
I acknowledge that you're not the only one with this problem and I also acknowledge that it is not just a few people with this issue. We will be working to improve our protocols over time, but unfortunately, we are unable to change our decision. Security protocols are never infallible, this means "good actors" will get restricted as well as "bad actors" being allowed through. That being said, again, we will work on improving our protocols over time.
@_date: 2018-03-21 05:46:59
Bill is awesome and I'm not just saying that because I work there. Each time he speaks, it's like he deserves an audience. I enjoy his interviews and discussions. Personally, I don't know how he can talk for so long without saying "um". He's very inspiring.
He handles all situations well. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:04:51
We do! Only through US-based AMEX cards though. ACH and wire deposits still take time, 1-2 biz days and 2-3 biz days respectively. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:58:17
I actually don't have the permission to view this data. That being said, I'm quite sure it's need to know only. I can tell you we expect a lot of growth, but we are prepared. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:31:28
Hey sorry to hear about your poor experience with Abra. I'd love to take a look and see if I can get you and your family up and running on our app. Please PM me more information.
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:21:14
Of course! Anytime, you are very welcome! Yes, you are correct. We are working towards native/direct integration of other cryptocurrencies, but only BTC is native. We are releasing native LTC very soon and hopefully ETH soon after. We understand that the whole conversion back and forth if you're going to withdraw funds is not ideal. We will be working to improve the flow. Let me know if you have any other questions! 
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:05:06
At this time, it's a TBD. We have a lot of projects/plans on our roadmap and I do not believe this is prioritized. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:58:59
Fun fact: Abra is actually an acronym. A better remittance app. So, Abra is cool. Abra like the app, not the Pokémon :) 
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:26:48
1. Yes, absolutely. Unfortunately I can't go into much detail due to lack of info/knowledge.
2. I need to check on how we handle that.
3. Something like the Ledgers attestation process? If so, nothing like that in our road map now.
And I try, what else is there to do at 1225 :p
Yeah, I'm with you on that. I can't speak too much on security since I'm not knowledgeable in it. I should learn more. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:41:37
Okay, update!
We will hopefully be supporting SegWit in several months.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:59:43
Hi mcbem,
I shall reply here as well.
Thank you for the reply and feedback. We do have security protocols which will restrict some users indefinitely. We actually do not store your social, CC, or bank info.
Again, my sincere apologies for the lack of help on this front.
Thank you for taking the time out to try our app,
Ryan from Abra
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:57:28
When the network is bogged down, we are all affected. Everyone in this space remembers December 2017. So, we were very much affected but we were able to get transactions passed through. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:07:03
The love is mutual! Let me know if you need anything or require assistance! 
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:23:37
Hi We actually do not sell any user information. Also, we do have a base in the Philippines, but we are not based out of the Philippines. We are based in the Silicon Valley and always have been.
Yes, we do collect KYC. Yes, users are restricted and sometimes not told why (depends, of course). Yes, our security protocols can affect good actors. Yes, do have a few upvoted posts. 
I will paste a reply to another post similar to this, we did re-evaluate this user and get him transacting again:
"Please note that unfortunately we do have restrictions similar to other companies, wallets, and/or exchanges. This is not necessarily due to legal reasons or fraudulent activity. Even with restrictions, users are always able to take funds out with BTC withdrawals and still able to do BTC withdrawals. The restriction would only affect bank and credit card transactions.
We have security protocols that mitigate risk, as I'm sure many of you guys know fraud is a huge factor in this space. A major part of reason we cannot provide additional information is due to the fact that we do not want to assist actual bad actors in gaming our security protocols.
For example (this is not an actual procedure) if your middle name was 3 characters long and we restricted ALL 3 character middle names and notified the person, "oh we do not accept 3 character middle names" and then the person would simply change it to longer or shorter than 3 characters.
I can't speak on behalf of other companies, exchanges, or wallets but that is why we do not provide additional information.
We do not assume everyone is a bad actor and we will still assist users with restricted wallets, but we do have a process like that and unfortunately it does sometimes affect good actors. We are working to refine our methods and protocols"
Also, please see this for some additional context (similar situation as well):
Then again, I am paid to work for Abra, so I am a shill by default, but I am quite sure I am not an idiot by most definitions.
We raised 40 million dollars via the old way of funding (not ICO). American Express invested in us. We have a great team in the United States and abroad. We do not believe any group or country is less. We do not believe in the notion of "third world" countries, but developed or undeveloped countries. A majority of the reason we were created was due to remittances to these "third world" countries you are referring to. Abra actually stands for 'A Better Remittance App'.
Now, I personally don't mind you calling us a scam, you're totally entitled to your own opinion. But I feel like too many people throw that word around when they're confused or unaware of the actual situation. The word scam used to mean a lot more than what people like you use it for these days. Your definition of scam may differ from mine. Every person in this company works way too damn hard for someone like you to dismiss their accomplishments and our vision for a better cryptocurrency-centric future and adoption because you simply misunderstand our app and protocols.
That being said, you're welcome to continue calling us a scam. In a few months, I would absolutely love to check back with you and maybe even have you become an Abra user if you'd want to.
If you have any other questions, concerns, or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to me here.
If you'd like to transact, I can see what I can do in terms of re-evaluating your wallet and getting you unrestricted.
Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great weekend,
Ryan from Abra

Fiat holding is hedged BTC into fiat. We built smart contracts to account for crypto/fiat.
A snippet from one of our FAQ posts:
"As an example, let’s say that you deposit 1 BTC into your Abra wallet, and decide to buy 10 ETH with it. At that point, Abra will create a smart contract that guarantees that you have the right to 10 ETH, regardless of the price fluctuations of either ETH or BTC. When you decide to exchange your 10 ETH back into BTC, we’ll calculate how much BTC you should receive, based on the price changes."
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:53:47
Yes, that is correct. We are looking to expand our bank support, but no time line as of now. We will be sure to keep people updated! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:45:14
Hello and good morning! Ultimately that depends on AMEX, we only facilitate the transactions. If it's a third party issued card, it can be charged as a cash advance. If it's a directly issued card, it will likely be charged as a normal charge/purchase. I would check with AMEX or do a trial transaction. Sorry for the lack of an exact answer. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:17:42
Security is very important to us. 1. You can recover it via phrase then overwrite it with a new phrase. 2. If malicious code or programs are on the phone, we can't protect against that. 3. We have general guidelines for safe practices - do not ever connect to public wifi or ones you don't trust. Stuff like that. Let me know if you have any specific cases or any other questions 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:53:01
Hi there! Yes, we are available globally. Just download the app and you're all set. You'd need to deposit Bitcoin to begin purchasing the other cryptos. Please do let me know if you have any questions! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:14:45
It takes quite a bit of resources to get this done. I am totally with you. I've always shared feedback like this with our team because it is important. However, our team has been doing incredible changes within the app. The ability to change fees has been lowered in priority. I'll share your feedback and hope to see it become larger on our radar. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:14:42
You do not need SSN if you are only using Bitcoin transactions. If you use banks, then yes an SSN is required unfortunately. We do not lock accounts since we are non custodial, and we don't have accounts, we call them wallets. However, we do have security policies that may restrict bank and credit card transactions, but users will still be able to deposit and withdrawal Bitcoin without issues. Let me know if you have any other questions! 
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:12:12
Unfortunately still TBD at this time. As soon as I know more and I'm able to talk about it, I'll be sure to notify people of it.
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:08:09
We hope to have this sooner than later!
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:25:35
Oh no, you're welcome to be harsh. We understand transparency is key here, especially on a platform such as this.
I believe we have one or two more big announcements regarding functionality and product.
After that, we would be looking to see which improvements are the most feasible and effective.
That being said, we are about to implement Litecoin's network under our hood in tandem with Bitcoin. This will help us scale, reduce fees for both us and our users, as well as faster confirmations.
I don't work in engineering or product, so please do not quote me on our ETA. I am unsure if we would be able to roll it out this year. That being said, I can promise we'll be making announcements regarding this in the future. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have other questions. I can also check with our teams tomorrow for an ETA. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:11:14
We had to change a lot due to the fees spinning out of control. I'll have to check with our team. If I don't reach out tomorrow, please remind me.
Thank you Sean! 
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:48:30
Haha. No comment to the first. But yes, we watched the credit card being your bookie and we all had a good laugh. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:52:48
Hey if you get a new phone - simply recover your wallet using your recovery phrase and all of your fiat/cryptocurrencies will be restored!
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:45:11
Of course, anytime :)
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:17:32
We actually do not support NEO at this time. But if we did, yes, you'd come in with fiat or BTC then exchange your balance either entirely or partially to another cryptocurrency. Then you could exchange it back to USD without going through Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:35:50
Hey, thanks for commenting. We do not offer 2FA since the app is only available on your phone. Each new device constitutes a different and unique wallet. This means you will be the only one using your wallet on your phone. So make sure to be safe and cautious with it. So, if we had something like a text 2FA, the text would pop up as you're using the app on that phone. However, we are looking at other options for 2FA. Hope that helps! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:46:07
Hi there! Yes I can try my best to help. Please PM me your email address so I can troubleshoot.
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:31:23
Any thoughts on this video? Also I'm here to answer questions if you guys have any.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:59:55
I think it's very much proprietary at this time. I believe we may publish a white paper at some point, but not sure if that is still happening or it has been delayed. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:40:27
We do not disclose the reasoning for our restrictions for anyone. We do have hard restrictions. I may make a post regarding our security protocols later.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:36:33
Hey ogmk, can you please PM me with more information? Like with email associated with your Abra wallet so I can take a look
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:01:08
Good question. We use a version of the BIP32 seed. You would need to remove the 'at' in front of the phase for your 12 word mnemonic. After that, you'd have to use a tool (we do not endorse or recommend any tool over another and exposing your key is extremely risky, so proceed with caution). You would need to use a custom derived path since our phrases are on another part of the blockchain domain. Let me DM you with more information. Yes, it's complicated and not a good experience. We'll be making changes in the future. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:10:02
Hey again!
1. We will be working to integrate SegWit hopefully in several months. (that's our update).
2. SegWit needs to be implemented first. TBD at this time.
I can't speak on behalf of Abra regarding what we need and what solves what. 
However, we do want to give users exposure to coins and providing an app/product that is well integrated and easy to use. People want to buy more altcoins, so in a way we do follow the market and try to support what people want. So it may not necessarily be that they believe in each and every coin supported, but they integrate it because people want it. I hope that makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:11:40
We are able to link bank accounts. However, we only support banks in the US and PH. If you're in the US, you can do ACH bank withdrawals and wire withdrawals. In the PH, you can do teller cash withdrawals. Let me know if you have any other questions. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:42:41
Hey We will hopefully be supporting SegWit in several months.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:38:00
1. We are looking into it. 2. Yes. 3. We are also looking into that. We love lighting labs, they came to our HQ for lunch and a presentation last year! So yes, we'll be looking at multiple options. We've been prioritizing our product, but once we release all 20 cryptocurrencies, we'll be looking at optimization and other improvements. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:42:35
It depends. If you're depositing just bitcoin, no. If you use a US bank or wires, you need to submit some KYC. Please message me if you have any other questions! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:02:03
Of course, not a problem.
1. No way to currently delete a wallet. We are working on deleting wallets. The flow right now is not optimal.
2. We may be adding some desktop support to view charts and info. We still do not plan to add actual app capability to desktops or laptops. And yes, we are looking into something like finger print scanning.
3. Thank you! Please bug me regarding any other feedback or questions :) 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:04:52
We have been making several intense changes to our app, we were prioritizing the reduction of fees on a grand scale.
Regarding the seed import, I'm not sure at this time. I'm sure I'll know more in the near future. My apologies for a bland reply
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:44:03
hey I just got an update. Unfortunately it is still TBD.
Let me know if you have any other questions,
Team Abra
@_date: 2018-03-24 04:44:57
We have increased our team for this process, so the process has been reinstated about two months ago. So, if you were restricted before this, you would have not received any information about the process since it was on hold due to demand.
I took a look into your wallet and your wife's, unfortunately we will not be putting both of you through our process. We do not disclose any reasons for restrictions because we do not want to give any additional information to help others game the system. Of course I'm not insinuating that you and your wife are bad actors, but that is one of our security protocols.
Unfortunately good actors will get restricted in this process.
