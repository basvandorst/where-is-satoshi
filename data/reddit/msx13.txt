Yep, using credit card involves even more fees. I'm talking about using the app and having your bank account linked for the payment. When you see the market price, you click buy, enter the amount and it gives you amount not BTC, it doesn't show you the current rate at USD and if you hesitate for a second and market moves the price gets updated in BTC, once again you don't see the current rate at USD. If you go back and start converting, by the time you are done, the price moves again.

I made similar mistakes many times. If u want in on it. Just buy it and HODL as everyone says. It's volatile but hopefully the overall trend is up. Don't have any bitcoins either. But will try to buy what I can afford in the future.

Bitcoin - Buy buy buy! Wallstreet Bye bye bye.

Awesome thanks !!!

I agree or at least give you the price your buying at update in USD and BTC. Having only BTC you have to calculate and by the time you are done calculating price changes.

As they say, the best things in life are free. I couldn't agree more with donating to Wikipedia. I don't own any bitcoins :( myself, but did donate $10. Unfortunately given the circumstances that all that I could afford at the moment.

iPhone app, but that's a huge convenience fee and most people don't even realize until later what they paid for what.

Haha, only if you promise to upload the picture of your new shirt :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:44:26
Yep.

Yea, talk about the news media bias and how it shapes everyone's opinion. It's all rigged game that's controlled and manipulated. They warn you: no, no, don't buy it, wait for us to get it first so that we can sell it to you and make some profit. Don't you dare bypass the wall street when you want to do an ICO.
