Question is, is he still investing?
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:32:39
And on their lambo orders
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:21:59
Get the week fu*ks out the market 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:20:25
Me buy many btc x50

Couldn’t agree more.. the term cryptocurrency is misleading for most projects. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:36:28
Any idea why they closed?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:16:56
What the fork is going on?
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:49:53
The backflip to the true BTC is now happening ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:55
Cooking on gas���� although missed buying the dip��

Welcome to the good life
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:15:13
Agreed some media spin here.. although maybe Kim Jong wants a lambo

Exactly this is buying opportunity and if you have brought in at the top no problem If you're in for the long term
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:07:42
Yeah same think this is more for spread betting purposes and other speculative instruments
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:37:16
The market cap is around 90-100 billion right now

Stressful day if watching charts but not sold a thing might clock off for a few days 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:39:22
Technically that there could be insufficient liquidity if everyone decided to unwind.  This is Bs to be honest.. as the claim by bank of America is based on sentiment nothing quantitative

Looking fwd to buying bitcoin in whole numbers ;)
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:24:14
Good work I'm planning a similar move on altcoins today.. spread 1000usd over several. Any recommendations please let me know
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:20:29
Couple of questions on the fork.. if I sell my btc straight after block height 491407 is reached  presuming I’ll be eligible for btg? Also, how can I determine the block height? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:52:28
Irrelevant. the source code is open source and has a team of developers, do your research before making such comments
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:16:19
What the hell are you trading on If your trading fees  are that high?
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:38:41
Zero context to your 60k number.. like others say if it beats stock market returns then it’s a good return 
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:08:21
Get a Trezor it will pay for itself and more in the long run 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:16:35
Funny how 100billion is considered a ‘bubble’ by some.. not even close in my opinion
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:54:11
Thanks, not selling just trying to understand whether there is a clear cutoff when the fork happens but from your answer sounds safer to just let it settle. Thanks for coming back
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:31:31
Call it bitcoin12
