Oh I'm still in real estate.  But I only collect the money now and have my sisters run it. She's a realtor. 
And as far as research,  my brother is the crypto pro and I get all my info from him. He's been mining since 08/09?
I still have a hard time wrapping my head around it all, I'm to old, but I do like money and crypto does that very well.

I do still have quite a bit (hehe) of bitcoin along with about a dozen other cryptos. 
Is far as bitcoin goes, I'm sitting on 5 digits as of this moment. Ethereum is another I have invested in heavily. Got in very early with that.
But my real income come in the way of real estate. I sold my landscaping business in 2014 and have been "retired" ever since.

I'm just glad I held on to everything. My brother gave me some back in 2010, I traded a bunch around and for some other alt coins, but he told me that I should take at least a 1/4 of what he gave me and to just forget about it. Well, I still have it (along with some of those "other" coins) and am sitting pretty.
Now im already retired (sold business in 2014) and invested heavily in real estate, but I would say 15% of my wealth is in crypto now. 
Only thing I wish is that I still had all those spent bitcoins. But it's only money, and I at this rate, I'll be able to buy that island I always wanted.
