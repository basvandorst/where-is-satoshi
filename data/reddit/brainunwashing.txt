So does this mean casascius.com can start resuming operations printing physical bitcoins? The IRS says it is a property and not a currency, but FinCEN says otherwise.. Makes 0 sense.

You have a good point, and that's the same issue of any company accepting multinational currencies as payments. The same reason why you get a payment processor to pay you in USD or whatever currency upfront instead of taking the risk yourself. Just my opinion of course =)

Good on them, I saw this earlier. Is this the first telecom company to accept bitcoin?

Red Cross won't even do that.

I'm not defending seanoutpost, I don't really trust any charity.
Even Red Cross refused to release where the Hurricane Sandy money went, citing "trade secrets." That is not transparent to me, at all.

True.  gives you more options because they also accept LiteCoin on top of BitCoin, and make deposits into your bank for USD and most other currencies.
Here is the latest news out there:

Mtgox is the same people behind privateinternetaccess?

I think of it like this... Why have CoinBase or BitPay if btc itself is the API? It's a payment processor for merchants who want paid in currencies other than bitcoin.
As for the second part, it's competition. If anything it will force all of them to provide new and improved solutions for payment.
It's like asking why have Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or any other credit card company when there is Visa?
