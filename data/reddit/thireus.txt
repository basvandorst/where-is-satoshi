Minimum relay fee is present among all Bitcoin nodes (starting version 0.8.2). By default the Bitcoin client enforces it with a certain value (0.00001 BTC I think), which means if you don't tweak your Bitcoin node, zero-fees tx will be rejected and will not be relayed by your node.
Node owners can however put a min relay fee of 0 (allowing zero-fees tx), however this is not a good idea since they will be highly explosed to tx/mempool flooding. Txs are held in mempool until accepted in blocks.
Nowadays it's very unlikely that miners (who also receive txs from other nodes) will receive and process zero-fees tx, for profit reasons and for the reasons mentioned in the first two paragraphs.

Not necessarily. Blocks being full means there are a lot of transactions, which means Bitcoin is being used. But that's a big vague, and an intensive use of the chain without valuable purpose is the real problem...
The issue with Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) is that it can't differentiate between TX flooding and legitimate transactions. So, ultimately, people who want to disrupt Bitcoin or slow down transactions being confirmed (i.e. during a big price shift on the market) will always be able to flood the blockchain. Fees are here to prevent this from happening, but the way Bitcoin implements them is flawed and doesn't truly help (i.e. when the attacker's purpose is especially to increase these fees).
So, is it a bad news if blocks are full? Well... it mostly depends of what these blocks are filled with. And what you really want to look after is not blocks being full, but the amount of pending transactions and the increase in fees, which have a direct and general impact on user experience and Bitcoin-based businesses.

A big entity or group which would include VISA with a strong business model can easily achieve what Bitcoin tried to do over the past 6 years.
Banks have survived without miners so far. They can just press the restart button with a checkpointing system and keep the system centralized but trusted for a while, just like several alts (including BTC) did in the beginning.
Nobody knows for sure what will happen next for Bitcoin. But one thing is sure is that the decisions that are made by the big guys will always be driven by money. And I'm pretty sure most can sacrifice a bit of "security" and decentralized bullshit\* for control.
Please don't be a Bitcoin fanatic and don't let your vision be altered by your holding.
\* I'm sure you understand that miners are in control of what is accepted or not on the blockchain. And what is happening right now with Bitcoin is simply a rewrite of the banking system, where bankers are miners, deciding of the fees and what is written or not on the ledger. So either you choose to let that system decide for itself who is in control and you end up with a mafia of Chinese miners, or you create an alternative where miners are dedicated and chosen entities. If I was VISA, the choice would be quite simple on that topic.

They could just fork Bitcoin's code. Start with a fresh and clean "controlled" ledger without all the crap that is in it (if you ever had a look at the BTC blockchain scripts you know what I mean). All current apps that are compatible with Bitcoin will be compatible with their version, because what they'd do would just be to start with a clean ledger. For the adoption they already have their clients, the lambda people who were not convinced by BTC or because it was "too complex".
They have nothing to earn from choosing Bitcoin instead of starting with a clean DRP-free version of the blockchain. And I'm not talking about rewriting the code... just starting with a different ledger.

@_date: 2014-12-18 23:19:37
Because most people bought after December 2013 and are now in loss for their investment.
The price has always recovered on short periods of time, but this downtrend is lasting too long and cannot be considered as a fast drop that will recover any sooner.
A lot of people do not have the patience, and are not professional traders. Investing in crypto is very easy compared to the stock market so a lot of amateurs are into it. Most pushed the price high and now can't handle their loss anymore. They left crypto and its bubble behind. The price will now stabilize without them, but it is a very big slap in the face for everyone.
As a sad story, all the people I know that were into crypto told me the same thing: "Oh you're still into Bitcoin? Is it not dead? What is the price now?". True story unfortunately.

They are not. The guy who sold on Bitstamp was a miner and early adopter (transaction has been tracked).

Thank you for sharing this story with us. Lots of people including traders are going to learn from your experience. I see some discussing how differently they would have handled the trade (location, friend, backup plan, etc.). I would see these comments more like a brainstorming about face-to-face trades than personal critics about your choices.
I personally think you managed to get out of that situation pretty well, it could have been worse than this. I sincerely trust this will get resolved, police is involved and everyone seems to have all the information needed to solve the case, you'll get your coins back.
Maybe just get a new phone number, and start switching your contacts to that one. Don't answer calls from hidden phone numbers or numbers you don't know. Drop the old phone number you were using for the trade as you don't want to hear anything back from the couple (who'd be tempted to threaten you by calling you or texting you). The police will do their job and investigate the case.

* Understand the innovation of the coin's technology. Read the source code of the coin you are going to support, make sure it brings the innovation you are looking for (always compare it to Bitcoin). If it doesn't meet your expectations in terms of "new" innovation, always fall back on the root (i.e. if you don't like Litecoin's innovation fall back to Bitcoin since it was the initial fork). If you can't read the source code, read the white paper and do not hesitate to criticize and ask questions in the coin's community forum regarding the implementation of the technology and most of all regarding its security.
* Do not support crypto-currencies for their marketing promises. Technology is most of the time more sustainable than marketing.

We are getting closer and closer to more efficient mining equipments but we are approaching the limits of what we can do. Another solution is to [re-use the heat]( produced by miners. Personally, I heat up my place with some mining rigs (instead of using heaters) which provide me with a few coins per month and save up on monthly expenses.
There is also an existing solution other than Proof-of-Work to secure transactions: [Proof-of-Stake]( I personally preferred switching for another crypto derived from Bitcoin which is [Peercoin](

*As expected: 
1. Huge pump on Bitstamp as several people will want to get out of the platform as soon as possible (unless Bitstamp releases the exact nature of the breach and explains that it has now been fixed and how).
2. People are going to move their Bitcoins on other trading platforms, while at the same time on the other platforms the price will follow the move.
3. Huge dumps on the other platforms will follow after more than 50% of these coins will have been moved.
4. Volatility restored.

So, without a third-party, where would your FIAT go?
You still need someone to convert FIAT and "digitalize" it (convert it to crypto). The best third-party is still mining equipment and "wasting" FIAT into electricity bills. But we already know the limits of PoW, and that doesn't apply to the average Joe.

On the long-term I think so too. It's useful for the coin's distribution but not for securing the blockchain as it is not eco-friendly. Proof-of-Stake is in my opinion the direction to take.

Early miners provided the supply. Today's mining is more concerning about the security and sustainability of the coin.
I personally think [Proof-of-Stake]( is a (I'd say not that bad) solution once the coin's distribution period is over, and it is also eco-friendly. I've switched to [Peercoin]( months ago for this reason, but again this is a personal choice.

Still need a third-party for buying and selling FIAT, but solutions exist for trading or holding the currency. People may criticize it, but NuBits (stable crypto at $1) can act like your FIAT deposit for this purpose. And multisig solves the escrow problem.
Then, you just have to buy/sell NuBits for FIAT just like buying bitcoins on localbitcoins or at an ATM or to your neighbor (assuming NuBits gets widely accepted to be deployed everywhere just like Bitcoin).

THIS --&gt; "Someone didn't like the question"
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:58:11
*  Yes, Peercoin is for now an hybrid but will switch off PoW in a near future. You cannot "create" new coins with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because PoS is based on coinage (so without initial coins, no coinage). PoW has thus to be introduced to generate the first coins and help the distribution, then it is deactivated in favor of PoW (it is to be noted that PoW/PoS ratio for Peercoin is 1/16, so the network is secured by PoS and not PoW). I invite you to read the [Peercoin's whitepaper]( in this regard. It is also discussed [here]( [here]( and [here]( to switch off PoW for Peercoin.
*  I would be glad to have further data about how many $ are injected into Bitcoin every day (and by that, I don't mean trading volume, I mean newcomers or new investments). In short we need to know the demand (which is reflected by the price, but the price is also correlated to the market supply).
*  Yes, since I don't have those numbers I cannot tell. I also assumed that mining farmer didn't pay for their hardware, are using the most efficient miners, are also not paying for the rent, etc. So I think that compensates a little.
*  That's a good question, I don't have the answer.

I agree, at this point it may not be for the average Joe to be able to grasp the entire complexity of the issue. And yes, I agree that Bitcoin and crypto-currency in general has to have a certain degree of simplicity so that at some point everyone will be able to use it.
However, we are in the process of developing a viable and working technology and system for crypto-currency. Because I think we can all agree that it still has faults. Which is what we are trying to do now. Develop it into a working viable system. But in this process of constructing it, yes it is still complicated and it should be, at least at this stage.
I believe that once we find and implement the best possible features, the best and most viable infrastructures, then the final stage will be to first simplify not the in-depth structure but the everyday use of it and second, to educate people about it. As an example, not everyone knows the under-layers of the FIAT financial system but everyone is using it everyday for example (Credit/Debit Card, ATM, etc.), it doesn't mean it is simple.

Why don't you fall back on Peercoin instead?
Paycoin is a Peercoin copycat with false marketing promises. But the technology they use in Paycoin (Proof-of-Stake) is exactly the same that is in Peercoin...

Nice way to avoid a full reply. This would have been a good start for a constructive answer but I'm afraid you have serious gaps in your knowledge. When that is the case perhaps you shouldn't venture to express opinions as facts.
Peercoin can indeed be considered as being centralized at its current state of development not because of Proof-of-Stake, but because of checkpointing (which was btw also introduced in Bitcoin's early versions). Peercoin is going through stages of development that indeed require certain security measures such as checkpointing. The next steps in Peercoin's development will be to make it fully decentralized and using PoS only. I invite you to read the [white paper]( in this regard or read the [Peercoin's FAQ](
Although I felt obligated to explain this issue, I believe it's most likely in vain. Based on the tone and phrasing of your previous answers you don't seem open minded enough. I did not do this to "pump and dump" Peercoin as you said. Peercoin will not grow or fall because of people like you. I do however believe in the future of crypto.

Exchanges' business model rely on trading fees. Downtime = No Trading = No profit for the exchange. Attackers are using this as a main point of pressure for ransom. If the amount of money the attackers are asking for is inferior to the money not earned by the exchange during downtime, the exchange may be inclined to pay the attackers to stop the attack and resume be able to business (which is of course the worst solution to pick).

Public keys derivate from private keys. You just have to generate private keys and calculate their associated public keys, then crosscheck with existing public keys (the ones in the blockchain were existing coins moved to).
Only issue with this is that approach is that:


That makes too many possibilities to try. And you'll have more chance to win the national lottery 10 times in a row than stumbling upon a private key associated to an address that's already been used. Unless you generate the private key not that randomly with some random number generator algorithms that can be guessed, such as a stupid random generator that outputs 0x1 0x2 0x3... as "random" numbers for your private key. People with the right knowledge will just try to find out addresses associated with private keys that were generated with bad random number generators.
You can play around with  if you're still not convinced.

I'm not, however this is common sense (I'm not saying all countries laws are following common sense, but it should be trivial to defend in court).
You proved you can break this key, which means anyone with minimum knowledge could do the same and impersonate the real owner. Hence this falls into public knowledge, whoever can guess the private key becomes the owner of the associated address.
From another point of view: let's assume I generate a tone load of weak private keys by following the most possible bad crypto practices (i.e. bad PRNG, brainwallet, etc.) and weeks later a user who happens to have unintentionally generated a bad private key too (which happens to be one of that I've already generated) using the same broken crypto sends a few BTCs to the associated address. Who's the owner of that private key in this case? Answer is: you are both the owner.
There is no timestamp and proof of ownership in Bitcoin's private keys. However, what the user could eventually do is to prove that the transaction to this broken address was a mistake (if he actually was the one issuing this transaction, but yet he'd have to prove it). In any case I wish him good luck with that...

The amount matters to me. When the passphrase is strong, I have more chances to be the only person to find it, so I don't collect the dust but instead wait for decent amounts to be accumulated. When an amount that I judge reasonable is dropped, I spend the coins. Of course here we are talking about strong passphrases, not the 18K dummy passwords that everyone has been monitoring for the past 3 years.
Edit: Well, that's just my strategy, maybe others prefer collecting dust instead of waiting for decent amounts, but that's their choice.

Don't store your coins anywhere but on a wallet you own. No matter how safe your auth on LBTC is, if an attacker has access to LBTC backend (which already happened a couple of times with LBTC) you can say goodbye to your BTC.

I don't think you understand my point. He wants to own Bitcoin, his company is paying for the fees he would have to pay to inject his money on a trading platform to buy BTC. So, in my opinion if he's willing to invest 70% of what he earns it's still more profitable to receive this part in BTC directly (even if he has to short it immediately on an exchange) than injecting FIAT on a market place (because he will have to pay more fees for that). It's simple to understand, check the price difference between LBTC and Bitstamp and check SEPA fees and you'll see for yourself.

Yes, the price is inflated on the exchanges. Otherwise miners wouldn't mine if they couldn't make a profit. So, basically miners are mining and selling some coins on the exchange to cover electricity bills, pay the facilities and equipements and pay their employees (I'm talking about big farms in China here). Then, they are probably keeping some that they can sell at any price (safe investment).

Because he's certainly not earning millions, so it will not impact the market's price? And he will avoid paying fees on localbitcoin or similar expensive fast exchange platforms to buy his BTCs.

Because a lot of users are now left without the ability to move their coins someone is going to create a malicious Brainwallet website (because brainwallet.org was closed).
Knowing the kind of people who were using Brainwallets (people who don't really understand security), they will most likely be tricked by this malicious website and will enter their passphrase (which will be silently collected by the website's owner).

Internship opportunity
Minister of Technologies of Digital Communication and Economy
Establish the advantages and disadvantages of the use of Bitcoin, analyse the impact of Bitcoin on the banking system and present applications that are being developed on the "Blockchain" to answer the various issues about privacy, security, freedom, transparency, etc.
Sector: Technology of information and/or Finances
Title: Study about the impact that cryptocurrencies could have on the country's economy and development perspectives behind Bitcoin's technology.
Job title: Intern
Starting: Now
Period: open
Contract type: Internship
Salary: Not paid
Too lazy to translate the rest. It's an internship offer to students after university. A pretty generic one. In my opinion, there's no need to buzz about it.
Again, this is just an end of studies internship, for students only. Which does not mean they are planning to do anything you said. They just want to use a cheap resource (an intern) to help them understand what is Bitcoin.

Great idea. The only problem is that if you give them to someone, that person will have to spend them immediately to his own wallet OR fully trust that you won't spend the coins before he does (because you know the private key).

The main problem is when you stumble upon big amounts of coins, you don't really want to expose the private keys. I'm quite surprised that nobody accused you of stealing their coins yet for the examples you exposed (even if I'm sure you didn't take any of these coins, and that some of the passphrases were cracked by others).
How did you manage to get in touch with the real owners?
Also, now that everyone can play with your tool, I'm pretty sure a lot of people will stumble upon the same flawed addresses, and there will be no way of knowing who the legit owners of these adresses are. Does that mean the bounty hunt is now open?

I was in a private conference with a huge multinational company that produces processors and all types of servers and things. You definitely know their name if you own a computer. One speaker, who is fairly high up in the company, had two slides where she spoke about "the block chain". She was quick to mention that she wasn't talking about bitcoin, which is a currency and other things" (with a neutral to negative tone of voice). A previous speaker had mentioned bitcoin when explaining how CryptoLocker viruses work to the attendees so it felt like she wanted to distance her topic from bitcoin. Anyway...
She went on to discuss how the block chain technology is here already, and will take over. There is no way to stop it. This disruptive technology is here to stay". I thought this was great to hear outside of my own bubble...but then she began to discuss how the top 5 financial institutions on the East coast have already decided on a private block chain between each other. This way they can have transparent transactions and an open ledger and network between them. She also said that eventually contracts and deeds will all be done on a block chain (along with many other bitcoin v2 type of things). She went on to said that companies in the future will group together and have private block chains between them to interact with each other.
All of the sudden I was fearful of this use of the block chain. This is not how I imagined it. I mean, they are just taking the open source tech and using it for their private back end systems and open ledgers. There will be block chains everywhere. Is this what bitcoin will go down for in history? Being an experiment that allowed the big financial institutions and corporations to come up with new back end systems? I was a little saddened by the end of her speech, honestly. What do you think?

Most of the time downvoted comments are so damn true on this sub. But here for example, this is something people don't really want to read (just like my reply). Maybe because they can't handle the truth.

Indeed. However, the law cannot prevent flaws from being exploited by malicious people. They can also just give the money to someone who'll carry the operation for them and just say nothing about it. Bitcoin's design is currently flawed, this is a fact, they just want to prove it openly in the hope of moving things forward. Bitcoin is still beta, and it's the perfect time to run these kind of tests, not in 10 or 20 years when we'll (maybe) have a much bigger and critical infrastructure and when real criminals will take advantage of these defects.

I had to retype all of this because apparently the spam filter didn't allow it to be posted and I didn't have the original account's info to see it and copy/paste it...SIGH.
I was in a private conference with a huge multinational company that produces processors and all types of servers and things. You definitely know their name if you own a computer. One speaker, who is fairly high up in the company, had two slides where she spoke about "the block chain". She was quick to mention that she wasn't talking about bitcoin, which is a currency and other things" (with a neutral to negative tone of voice). A previous speaker had mentioned bitcoin when explaining how CryptoLocker viruses work to the attendees so it felt like she wanted to distance her topic from bitcoin. Anyway...
She went on to discuss how the block chain technology is here already, and will take over. There is no way to stop it. This disruptive technology is here to stay". I thought this was great to hear outside of my own bubble...but then she began to discuss how the top 5 financial institutions on the East coast have already decided on a private block chain between each other. This way they can have transparent transactions and an open ledger and network between them. She also said that eventually contracts and deeds will all be done on a block chain (along with many other bitcoin v2 type of things). She went on to said that companies in the future will group together and have private block chains between them to interact with each other.
All of the sudden I was fearful of this use of the block chain. This is not how I imagined it. I mean, they are just taking the open source tech and using it for their private back end systems and open ledgers. There will be block chains everywhere. Is this what bitcoin will go down for in history? Being an experiment that allowed the big financial institutions and corporations to come up with new back end systems? I was a little saddened by the end of her speech, honestly. What do you think?

No seriously... I don't see why banks shouldn't do some R&amp;D in blockchain tech, just like everyone else does (i.e. altcoins like Ether). Banks are mostly interested by the security and sustainability of implementing a blockchain ledger (= safe, reliable and sustainable database), which in my opinion is much better than storing a couple of numbers in a SQL database.

Of course it's real volume bro, more than 550 million dollars exchanged every week, that's about 5 times the total of all Europe/U.S. exchanges' volume combined. Looks perfectly legit to me. China is a big country, full of Chinese who eat Bitcoin everyday.

We've been talking about it here as well. It's not FUD.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:13:41
Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work only coin and is heading towards mining centralization. Today other methods to secure a blockchain exist, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or Decentralized Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). All of them can be abused, but take a combination of both PoS+PoW and you create a sustainable and flexible solution.
I came up with the following analogy:
* In the beginning we only had cars running on oil. Then we discovered that oil is not eco-friendly and is also a limited resource. So, we realized that we needed to switch to something more eco-friendly and sustainable: electricity. A good idea, unfortunately the first attempts of practical implementation of this technology in cars failed ... So first, we switched to hybrid cars (which provided a partial solution to the oil problem). After several years, we finally came up with sustainable technologies to have fully-electric cars such as Tesla (the technology behind it is finally working well and allows us to eliminate oil).
Today we have Bitcoin, witch is PoW-only and wastes a lot of electricity for securing the blockchain. As a matter of fact, it's also heading towards mining centralization. We then discovered Proof-of-Stake, but the technology is still insecure and needs further research (the recent DPoS papers are an example of this research). But it's already possible to switch to hybrid systems. Peercoin (2.5 years-old and still running) is in my opinion a good example of working hybrid system with PoS and PoW. In the future I'm quite confident that PoW will clearly show its limitations. And hopefully, we'll have sustainable and secure PoS-based coins (again, when the techno will be ready).
At the moment Bitcoin is still good to use, such as oil cars are still good to use... But I hope the community understands that this is not a viable and long term solution. We have to start making the changes now and develop new solutions. Some options already exist. We just need to take the plunge, make the switch and concentrate our research on these topics. We are all working towards creating a better future, that was and is the main reasoning behind all this, as much as some (or many) treat it as just another business. It's their right to do so. But at the same time it's our duty I believe, those of us who are in it not just for the prospect of getting rich, to be open minded enough to accept that it is still a working process and it needs perfecting. The end result might just be world changing.

Not sure if we should really get excited about that...
The price keeps going down since November 2013, and $260 is still one of the lowest prices of the past 2 years.
Maybe in 2 more years from now you will also post the same kind of message stating "110$ guys!"...
In any case, the recent pump brings a bit of faith. Congratz, if you discovered Bitcoin and bought recently, you will make a bit of profit.

Inflate the volume and push bots or people into thinking that there's a big trading activity.
If I push the price up by buying coins while faking the volume, there are more chances that other people will follow the trend and get onboard because they will think a lot of people are trading. If I do the same without faking the volume with just one trade, people won't give a damn about my trade.
