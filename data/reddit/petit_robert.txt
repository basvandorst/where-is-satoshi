Commodities were just an example, and maybe not the best one : the derivatives markets on all sorts of financial assets (loans, bonds, mortgages, you name it...) dwarf their underlying assets in size.
Some people argue that the amounts traded via these derivatives are virtual, in the sense that the ultimate settlements will be a lot lower than the nominal amounts traded. Still, that works as long as no entity defaults on the deal, otherwise every one involved just tanks (like it happened in 2008)
So, in short, yes, there is a difference between a pseudo currency and derivative markets on commodities, but I don't see much difference between a pseudo currency and the one that is being seemingly produced at will by the various central banks that keep injecting liquidity into the financial system to keep it going.

Yes, and owned by private banks as I recently discovered. So that when the latters' outrageous bets turn out fine, their overlords hand themselves huge bonuses for their performance, and when they turn sour, they get bailed out (and get those bonuses still, as history as shown).
I realize I may appear sour, but after a decade of working in finance I have lost faith in the present system. I can't say whether bitcoin is a viable alternative, but IMO _anything_ will do, as long as it's different :-)

You should have a harder look at futures markets in commodities, among others. The percentage of delivery ratio is on the order of 1% if memory serves (I've been out of finance for a couple decades now). It means every contract has been traded 100 times before the final owner takes delivery of the merchandise.

That made me laugh. As if they did...

I'm not so sure. See how Alan Greenspan admitted, in congressional hearings after the 2008 financial debacle, that his comprehension of the economic system was completely flawed.
[Here's a reference to it](
I can't play the video on the article, so not sure it's what I saw, but its quite scary to hear/watch him say that, he was considered one of the best economists on the planet at the time.

Absolutely, and _that_ is what landed him one of the most coveted jobs in the world, not his comprehension.
Come to think of it, you may be right that some economists do understand our economy. In my experience though, these people are eliminated from the system pretty quickly :-(
