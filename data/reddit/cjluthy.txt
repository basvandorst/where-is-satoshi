I was going to say - this tweet would be *MUCH* more useful if it also had a rough estimate of the profits made by the scheme(s) that they eventually got fined for.
But you're absolutely correct - in my experience the "fine for being a scammer" is usually less than 5% of the "total profits made from running the scam for N years" (and even 5% is RARE - I'd ballpark a realistic estimate at 2%).

How could it? 
You traded your oil for an amount of grain that has equivalent value. As in "You drive a truck full of oil over to person A" and "Person A drives 10 trucks of soybeans over to you". You and Person A shake hands and agree that ownership of the goods in question has changed (trucks excluded). 
What in there causes capital gains tax to be triggered? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:21:40
At that point aren't you basically bartering a certain amount of bitcoin for a certain amount of goods/services?
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:56:23
Kind of - but if Bitcoin was already being treated - equally - as a currency, Ron Paul would not need to make this statement. 
The way its currently treated is more similar to a commodity - you can hold the actual, physical, commodity (oil, corn, soybeans, pork bellies, etc... let's use oil as an example) to sell at any time - similar to Bitcoin. However, if you were holding physical oil, and you decided instead to own a whole lot of soybeans, *AND* you found someone who had soybeans and wanted physical oil, you absolutely could directly trade your physical oil for their physical soybeans - without capital gains being triggered. 
However, if you did the *EXACT SAME THING* with futures contracts for Oil / Soybeans, you would have to sell your Oil futures on the exchange (exchange for dollars - triggering a cap gains event) - and then buy Soybean futures. And your "trading partner" would do the exact opposite thing.

Then the price of bitcoin would skyrocket, due to most of us HODLing.

You are - Sorry. I quickly looked back at the original post after writing mine, saw the word "Ozzie" and I was all "Oh shit, I just called an Aussie a Brit, he's going to be mad" - didn't stop to read context. 
Sorry about that!

Surely they would be at least somewhat excited about lower transaction fees (as compared to Visa/MasterCard), no?
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:50:50
Right. Which is exactly what the fuck should happen.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:27:13
Yeah, that's not cool. Hence why he would sue. If he has dollars in his account he should receive dollars when he "cashes out". Forcing him to buy crypto, move it to another exchange, and sell it *THERE* and attempt to get dollars from that other exchange - well, that's not something that a properly functioning "exchange" would do. Either they have liquidity problems (of USD, and cannot pay him), or they have been instructed to do something to this account by law enforcement (IRS possibly, or SEC/CFTC). 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:13:19

Because, fuck them, that's why. 
They are now unnecessary.
They currently skim 3% of all transactions. They use this to run their network/servers/security/etc. I'm certain for a fraction of that someone could come up with a solution that would implement a charge-back type functionality.

I think your definition of "common knowledge" is *WAY* off.
This scam is targeting your grandparents trying to invest in bitcoin, by browsing to www,bitcoin,com and entering their credit card number. 
Not crypto-geeks.

It doesn't matter. The court can force them to give you an amount of dollars that is worth the same as your stolen bitcoin at current market prices, if you want to immediately buy bitcoin with those settlement dollars, go for it.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:52:29
Fair enough.
Though, anything approaching the historical definition of "privacy" can, sadly, only be re-gained by high-altitude atmospheric EMP detonation.

All he has to do is transfer it to an exchange, and pretend he bet it all (and lost it all) on some shitcoin scam. 
And then be very public about it.

You need to talk about how there is an absolute limit on the total number of bitcoins - there is no "printing new bitcoins". Explain that there is Mining of bitcoins but that is merely discovering bitcoins that have been undiscovered previously. They are not "new" bitcoins, they count against that absolute total number. 
You should also clearly explain that, just like the milk example, the amount of Bitcoin that you can purchase with a fixed amount of dollars, will go down over time. This is because it is *THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR ITSELF* is actually going down by printing billions of new dollars per year (when, at the same time, there are no new bitcoins are being created).
That is the fundamental point you need to get across. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:13:54
I think he expects his peers (newb's with no knowledge of Bitcoin - they are pretty much *EVERYBODY'S* peer at this point) to be as intelligent and as interested and as aware as he is. 
Unfortunately there is a large percentage of the general population that will never be that.

Surely there is a YouTube video with "typewriter sounds" on it.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:50:41
You could also do your own noise cancellation... Microphone directly over the typewriter, run signal thru signal inverter, then out to a speaker. Since the speaker noise is exactly inverse (opposite) of the typewriter, they would cancel out for the most part.
You could also just simply do some standard noise cancelling tech - sound dampening foam cut like VVVVVVV on the walls (like you'd see in a recording studio), possibly make a box of sound dampening material that allows your hands in, and has a camera inside, and put the typewriter in there.

I'm *GLAD* I went to sleep and then woke up to a world where BTC has galloped away to 7k.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:23:48
My arbitrary number was $1,040,000. I wanted 7 figs after paying back debt. Had it kept going another 2 or 3 months that was a very realistic figure to hit.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:22:36
Yes, and looking back on it, it was stupid.
My reasoning was "It would be stupid for me to pay this back, I'm only paying 20 percent and I will easily make triple that in the market in the next 3 to 6 months.". Very short sighted.
But I was making money hand-over-fist. Consistently. Had been for a year and a half. It was a "Bitcoin 1k -&gt; Bitcoin 20k" type scenario.  Was pissed at myself for not investing in this direction earlier, had I done that I would have easily make a shit ton of money. 
So, at the time, the reasoning made sense. It no longer does. In fact, I'm pissed at myself that I didn't sell at the top and buy something stupid like a Ferrari. At least had I done that, I could sell it and still recoup some capital. Instead I went to zero (which was really -40k). Very painful.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:49:58
If you are actually doing this you better be trading "long-only" strategy and aggressively using stop-losses to limit downside.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:57:03
Once you are up a little bit, you should set stop-loss sell orders at your buy-in price, that way you will automatically sell at the right time to preserve your initial capital so you can pay back your loans.
Too many people borrow money to invest and then get owned by it.
I'm saying this as I am currently 36 months into a 40 month pay-back of $40k that I borrowed, invested aggressively up to 500k, and then promptly lost (very quickly I might add). I was lucky that a relative had the $40k sitting around and was willing to give me an interest-free loan. 
Don't be me.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:56:22
No reason you couldn't have some automation set up to transfer your coins from your personal wallet to &lt;exchange_X&gt; and immediately afterwards, enter sell orders @ mkt price...

Bitcoin is a perfectly mathematically regulated market. No Ben Bernanke to mess with it. It is an algorithm. Unless that algorithm is broken in a few known ways (google them), Bitcoin will *ALWAYS* continue to regulate itself as dictated by its time-based algorithm (2-weeks).
So volatility doesnt matter. Humans can panic. The market will still function. 
Bitcoin has sufficient decimal places in the currency to support drastic inflation and deflation. This should be sufficient to facilitate the functioning of the currency through normal (non-exploit) market conditions.
