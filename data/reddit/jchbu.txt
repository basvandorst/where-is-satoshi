IKRRR...... this shit is worrisome as hell. the problem is most passive hodlers who jumped on in the recent months can't be bothered to understand this kind of news

I think this is legit. $62 mill is too specific for a scam, it seems to be fairly official and well reported, and "HACK" includes human error, ie, incompetence. if you get down to it, most modern "hacks" are not brute force but rather manipulating the human factor. big companies are hacked because of one weak link in the chain

The thing is, hype for the price of crypto can actually help with adoption. At first, people won't be hopping on because of underlying technology, but because price can actually work as a more powerful incentive. Think of all those who hopped onto the Bitcoin train not because they understood blockchain, but simply because they were both greedy and trusted those who **did** understand it.

!Important Question! Will anything happen to BTC's price when CME launches their bitcoin futures on [Dec. 18th]( I know, I know, BTC futures already exist, but in general, what happens to short interest with increases in institutional exposure to bitcoin?
(pls roast me)

This needs to be recognized more often...

It's been compared to the 2008 crash, where fake assets were involved. It's just too easy and too profitable. It's human error as well: whether or not Bitfinex has/had the foresight to realize that while it's profitable, it could result in huge consequences for them and the whole BTC market. Then again, those guys are probably pretty smart. So it could go either way.

What's the definition of a bubble?

THIS is the truth. While there are a few rich holders, the majority of bitcoin's investing base holds each only hundreds to thousands of dollars. Fewer have their life savings in bitcoin, and most buyers are young people.

Logic is sound. But how can we be sure that it's truly one big investor divesting, as opposed to simply lots of smaller investors divesting?

All I can say is good luck. These kinds of suits against multiple individuals and companies are tough as hell

Sorry I kindly disagree about "Orwell style Big brother" and "wide spread corruption." Banks support the whole system and it's whiny to start complaining about inability for transparency and permissionless transactions. Banks handle all the tough shit behind the scenes. Yeah sure, they take a cut, but they do a lot of the hard work of making sure the economy doesn't go to shit.
Edit: I mean this in a respectful way. I know most here are BTC advocates and I'd love to hear your opinion.
