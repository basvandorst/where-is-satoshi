So are you saying he is wrong? That Bitcoin is better off without the hard fork he proposes (2 MB block size and changing the PoW method)? Or have you simply run out of arguments?
I know this sounds kinda rude, sorry about that... I'm just trying to better understand the issues (and possible solutions)

The difference is actually not that important, because it's still just probabilities.
With 49% or with 51%, you have almost the same chance of generating multiple subsequent blocks.
Edit: Disregard this comment. Apparently it has been proven that I'm wrong.

That's what I had trouble understanding. Now I got it. Yay. :)

How can that be right?
The premise: Roughly every 10 minutes, a block is solved anywhere in the network. Any node can find the correct hash, this is basically random. That's the basic principle of the blockchain.
Now, if you own 50% of the processing power of the entire network, then the chance that you will solve the next block is 50%.
So you still can't be *sure*.
At least that's what I thought...
Edit: Thanks for the resources and explanations guys, I feel a bit stupid now ;)

I've spent hours of reading about transaction chains, the blockchain, and the maths behind all of it...
Then I watched that video, and I realized I had barely understood anything of what I had read.
Then I read more technical and mathematical background information again, and finally I understood most of it...
This video is a perfect starting point.
