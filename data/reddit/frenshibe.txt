Starting rumors on social media in China and being the source of its spread is reprehensible by law. I think that new rules started to take effect early 2013. I am not saying no one is trying to spread rumors but it significantly decreased since last year.
to come back to the huobi blog post, they basically just say they will use money from their "emergency reserve" to compensate traders to some extend.

What started as a joke it is still a joke. It just got a bit more serious will all the doge related projects and charities that flourished over the past 3 months.
I do trade bitcoin, litecoin and doge. nothing else. The reason why I trade bitcoin is because I think it has a chance to have a bright future. The reason why I trade litecoin is because the holders want (so much) to have the same fate bitcoiners had that it makes it a super volatile coin on any minor news. The reasons why I trade dogecoin is because it is very volatile/liquid as well and because I see it as the only coin that has something different from the other alts: a community that you may like or hate and real life projects being developed.
Note that I say trade, cause I do not hold much of each
