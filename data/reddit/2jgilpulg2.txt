Bitcoin is just scratching the surface. Very few people are familiar with Bitcoin. And, most importantly, Bitcoin is not just a currency. Bitcoin and its blockchain technology is a new paradigm that will change civilization. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:28:01
And, eventually, Bitcoin will be more popular than the dollar and all the other fiat currencies.

Those who think Bitcoin is a bubble do not know that Bitcoin is more than a currency. It is a new paradigm with a technology (blockchain) that will transform the world.

Bitcoin is volatile. So, it will go up and down. However, the long-term trajectory will be ascending.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:06:29
Yes, once BTC reaches, say, $20,000 traders will take their profit. BTC will dip. But then, seeing the dip, many new traders will renew force will buy sending the BTC to the next mark: $40,000.

Financial experts and economists and should put aside their obsolete economy theories, and design brand new economic theories to explain Bitcoin’s amazing behavior.

Schnorr signatures is a logarithm that could help to address one of the most pressing problems affecting Bitcoin today: scalability. Additionally, Schnorr signatures could help protect Bitcoin from certain types of spam attacks. Schnorr signatures could replace Bitcoins’ signature digital algorithm, ECDSA.

Yes, it is an early start. The rate of adoption will continue to increase. For example, now,  as millennials become more acquainted with the cryptocurrency’s inherent features, in growing numbers, they are willing to put their savings into Bitcoin.

No, it is not an addiction. Bitcoin is a passion.

Great news! PwC is joining EY. EY became the first of the Big Four to accept Bitcoin for its services. According to an EY press release,

Limit supply is one of Bitcoin's greatest strengths. It makes Bitcoin immune to inflation.

No. I would only sell in case of extreme financial need.

Bitcoin is the most safe haven currency.

Get used. Bitcoin will keep on breaking psychological barriers for a long, long time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:50:14
It is more than a currency or an asset. Bitcoin is a new paradigm that will change our civilization forever.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:37:17
Yes, lots of volatility expected. Now, Bitcoin is about to be tested by the new environment that futures trading will impose. Bitcoin will undoubtedly show once again its inherent capacity to quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment, and then, with renewed force, it will continue its ever ascending trajectory.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:11:14
If it dips, it is part of the game. When Bitcoin goes above $13,000, some traders take their profits. Then, BTC dips to allow new traders to take a position with renewed force. Thus, BTC's overall trajectory is always ascending.

 Quantum computing might help. Yes, Electricity continues to make up the largest cost associated with Bitcoin mining. But thanks to advances in quantum computing research, reductions in energy consumption and costs might be just around the corner.

Bitcoin is not a bubble. It is a dramatic paradigm shift, which will provide us with the unique opportunity to get rid of the obsolete and unfair monetary and banking system.

According to the developer Nadav Ivgi,
"The setup is a running c-lightning node on a server at home or on the cloud, which you connect to remotely from your phone. Your phone doesn’t have to be online, but the server does. The server can provide several wallets."

First of all, you have to believe in Bitcoin. You have to believe that it is a new paradigm that will dramatically change the obsolete, unfair,  monetary and banking system.

Let's cross our fingers so BTC might break the resistance level o $9,600 in the next few hours, and hit $10,000 before Tuesday.

However, in a not too distant future, we might be taxing robots for the wealth they produce, instead of taxing man.

I said the same some time ago. I said I would be out when BTC hit $5,000. Fortunately, I did not.

Your step-dad is a wise man!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:31
Then, what the mega-rich will do with all the bitcoins? Just trade among themselves?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:35:00
About $500 is enough to start investing. Perhaps, BTC will hit over $10,000 within the next few hours. Then, it might dip at about 8,500. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:11:20
Scoffers will eventually get tired because Bitcoin will continue its ascending trajectory for a long while. Bitcoin's adoption rate is still very low. So, there is lots of room for Bitcoin to grow. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:12:04
Only invest what you are willing to lose. And, beware of "irrational exuberance."
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:00:45
If you have to post such a question, the answer is, stop trading.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:26:52
It is over $9,400. It might hit $9,500 within hours, or even minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:03:01
Beware of "irrational exuberance."
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:38:17
Most likely, this trend will continue skyrocketing as more people become aware of Bitcoin’s virtues. And, Bitcoin will continue its ascending trajectory for a long while. Bitcoin's adoption rate is still very low. So, there is lots of room for Bitcoin to grow. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:35:02
Bitcoin’s recedes a little bit as it gets the strength to smash the $10,000 resistance level. Then, Bitcoin will continue its ascending trajectory for a long while. Bitcoin's adoption rate is still very low. So, there is lots of room for Bitcoin to grow. Therefore, you might wish not to wait for too long.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:29:25
I feel that I will never sell my bitcoins ever again.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:52:30
Bitcoin will continue its ascending trajectory for a long while. Bitcoin's adoption rate is still very low. So, there is lots of room for Bitcoin to grow. So, we will have to get used to posts with titles, such as “New All-time High.”

Bitcoin is not only money or currency. It is a new paradigm that will transform society. The three-thousand-year-old monetary system, and in turn the obsolete banking system, are already becoming casualties of the cryptocurrency’s all-encompassing technological revolution.

Bitcoin's rate of adoption is low. But it is starting to increase now. The millennial generation does not trust financial institutions. Savings accounts, which are one of the most emblematic banking instruments, are becoming irrelevant. In fact, millennials are losing interest in building their savings under the traditional banking system.

A Bitcoin is the best gift ever!

I would not be surprised if I wake up on Monday morning to see BTC $10,000.

I would never short Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s resiliency allows it to absorb punishment and recover rapidly. Bitcoin will continue its ascending trajectory for a long while. Bitcoin's adoption rate is still very low. So, there is lots of room for Bitcoin to grow.

Bitcoin is by nature a volatile animal. You can benefit from Bitcoin’s volatility. That is why I buy in the dips and sell when the price is high.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:55:32
Volatility benefits traders, in particularly, short-term traders. They buy low and sell when the price is high. If there is no price change, traders cannot profit.
