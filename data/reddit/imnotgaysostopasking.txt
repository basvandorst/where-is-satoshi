No point 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:45
After buying 3 coins and mining a further 5 in 2012 I’m cashing out. I’m not confident this will survive the launch of the futures this weekend. 
Good luck all

Yep I’ve reached the point where I don’t see any possible was I can make more money off this 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:49:13
202000 out of how many which were lost? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:41:21
Not enough for the house I'm looking to buy 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:45:22
I bought 20 at $300 last year, finally going to sell :) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:55:02
Thanks, so what happens to the missing 600 000? Are they gone forever? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:01:20
I'm new to bitcoin but what happened to all the lost coins from MtGox? Will there ever be recovered? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:14
Evidence that it’s time to sell 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:45:06
I invested $33 and it hurts to lose it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:00:34
Apologies, I didn’t realise my statement would trigger you 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:30:26
I never said I know more, I got lucky and retired at 27 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:05:07
How many coins did they mine? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:34:26
Smartphones existed before Apple 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:08:31
If you say so 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:03:26
Worst advice ever

So naive 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:44:46
What year?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:09:10
I bought in at $200 and sold at $19k. It’s way past the bubble phase now 
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:51:58
Did that really happen?
