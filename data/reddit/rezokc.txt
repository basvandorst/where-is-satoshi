@_date: 2014-11-16 15:35:26
It's a solution in need of a problem. Why pay someone to sell you a "gift card" redeemable for bitcoins (with "convenience fees" passed on to you) when you can just make and give your own paper wallets? Further, what happens when the company folds? If all they're offering is a glorified paper wallet, then there's no need for them. If they're holding actual BTC funds, who's to say that they're not going to go the way of the Gox? The only person I see benefiting from this in any way is the gift-card seller.

Mt. Gox is your villain. 
Accusing Bitcoin of this is like blaming HTTP for the Target Data Breach. It's a protocol, nothing more. It's math. If you want a solution to the evils of theft, start with human nature. 
I was in no danger of being robbed. My keys have always been in my possession. 
Seriously, read up on how it works.
I still own and use Bitcoin. Because of Bitcoin and the Gyft app, I never used my credit card at Target during the time the data beach occurred.

You are wrong. Each dollar of value in gift card purchases with Bitcoin = 3 points. Each point = $0.01. So a $100 gift card gives you $3.00 toward a future gift card purchase. You can apply it to your next card or save it up for a future free card, once you have enough points.

Your ignorance is showing. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a company. But troll on. I did very well with Bitcoin. Heading to Europe in a few weeks, actually. Paid for entirely with Bitcoin proceeds. Helped several friends out of financial binds with cash gifts, made possible with Bitcoin. I lost nothing and gained much because I chose not to be greedy and not risk anything that I couldn't afford to lose. I also chose not to entrust my Bitcoins to anyone else. 
I'm doing incredibly well right now. In part due to Bitcoin.

All of this is primarily to insure that the keys are being created using your own computer, and not on some remote site that could be copying the keys it generates for you. 
So those keys will never touch the Internet until such time as you need to sweep those funds off of the paper wallet.  USE CAUTION when you sweep funds off a paper wallet to a PC/tablet/phone based wallet - and be sure to sweep the whole amount. If you need to put some of them back, put it on a fresh paper wallet and dispose of the old paper wallet.

True. It will always seem wonky as long as we're valuing BTC by fiat. Also, though, by paying in BTC, we're rewarding each other for actually using it. I mean, imagine if that 10,000 BTC pizza purchase had never happened? You have to not think too short term. We're still on page one. :-)

I do understand your concerns. On the other hand, I'm increasingly bothered that taxation (in my country) is being used to create an inescapable intranational surveillance network. I'm increasingly bothered that taxation is being used on a local level (in my state and my region) to roll back hard-fought victories in women's health and reproductive rights and voting rights and to perpetuate discrimination against minorities and LGBT communities. Not to mention the fact that those who pay the *least* taxes (corporations and the billionaires who own them) get almost all the representation, while the rest of us suffer the outcomes of government legislating according to their whims.
I do also acknowledge the technology barrier - but it is definitely up to us to assist in breaking through those barriers.  Education about Bitcoin in underprivileged communities, encouraging small businesses to accept it, working with existing inexpensive technology to put Bitcoin access and portability in the hands of everyone. I'd love to see some of this money going into creating faster and faster ASIC-mining technologies going, instead, into creating inexpensive wi-fi enabled BTC-specific portable devices that put secure payments and funds transfers into the hands of everyone.
The first large scale wide-scale access of Bitcoin is now in Kenya.   It is my firm belief that Bitcoin adoption will happen first in third-world countries and work its way up.

Seriously, the great thing about Bitcoin is that it's as tangible or intangible as you want or need it to be.
With a deterministic wallet, you don't even need to have a Bitcoin app on your phone or laptop when you pass through security. When you arrive at your destination and you're at your airport? Download wallet app, download the app that converts your passphrase to your private key, import, and done.

I bought a $49 pocket Android device from Best Buy called a Trio Stealth. Added Mycelium to it. Have it registered to a new Google account not used for anything else. It only knows my home wi-fi and my cellphone tether wi-fi, and only gets connected to wi-fi when I need to add funds or move funds to my phone or to offline wallets (or sweep offline wallets). Locked down with a seven-digit PIN.
I keep no funds on either of my computers, if something gets sent to them, I offload it as soon as possible.  Paranoid? Maybe.

Yes, that is a drawback. Figure it wouldn't cost anything at all to scoop up a few more old Droids like these.
The Windows 3.11 idea is intriguing, as well. With a MSDN membership - I had one until it expired a few months ago - you can get installs of Windows all the way down to the earliest builds. So it's possible to get a clean copy of 3.11 with a brand new key.

Oh, no. They're both very active and very approachable. I bought a little 59 dollar cheap tablet to see if it would make a useful single-app Bitcoin wallet. It choked on the most widely used standard qr reader apps and crashed - the app that  most Android wallets use. I mentioned it on Mycelium's G+ page and both the Mycelium devs and Schildbach are already working on a fix to make it work.

I did my first LBC buy this week. Placed my buy order, seller responded quickly and we arranged our meeting point. I was issued a verification code which I was told would match the confirmation code sent to the seller from LBC once the funds were released to my LBC account. The seller didn't have a smart phone but he brought a print out from his end of the transaction that included a QR code which I scanned. It took me to an online link with a button marked "Release Funds". I clicked it, he got a text from LBC, responded to it, and received the verification code which matched mine.

Legal Tender vs. Accepted Form of Value Exchange.
One does not have to be the former in order to be the latter.
Legal tender means it *must* be accepted as payment of any and all public or private debts. I think it will be *favored* by many as such, and more so as time goes on - particularly when it becomes more integrated as a protocol, like the WWW did.

Cash out 1.5 BTC for yourself.

Download Gyft on your phone and use the remainder to buy holiday gift certificates for family and friends.
Pat yourself on the back for being a smart person.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:27:25
Since Gyft now offers gift certificates for where I do most of my shopping (or can), everything that's not gas money or bill money or most-of-my-grocery money is going into Bitcoin. When I need to shop, I buy at that moment and redeem. If I don't need to spend, what I don't spend should continue to increase in value. And I think a lot harder about what I *need* vs. what I want.
