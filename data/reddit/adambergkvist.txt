You can’t replicate a painting. You can replicate bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:14:52
Open source...it CAN be replicated.

Why are you buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:16
So I assume that BCH will keep to grow in popularity until it is released?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:07:07
I bought bitcoin XBT months back. Financial instruments that reflect value development of bitcoin already exists.

@_date: 2017-12-17 23:37:26
"I can make an exact replica of a painting" What are you talking about? How I am I suppose to take you seriously when you claim that you can replicate paintings.
You are talking about the network of users, which cant be replicated. But Bitcoin itself can be replicated.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:38:35
You da real mvp.

Half of those are not FUD
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:17:24
People here are morons. They downwote me for stating a fact. Bitcoin is open-source. It CAN be replicated. But you are also right about the fact that the network of people can't be easily replicated. However, that's another question.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:53:13

Will you love it when the financial institutions will offer this service? Thus re-taking control of our financial and monetary system...
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:05:49
BTC will become a highly valuable asset in the future. We will lock them away in safety in exchange for something else that will reflect the value of our locked away btc. That something else will be used to buy goods...aaaand we’re back at square one.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:16:01
You are a weirdo if you held from 2011 until today. Most of the people that bought that early have sold.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:51:10
People that have been trading for a while understands this. It’s the newbies that are down voting you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:02:36
so mean...
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:46:38
No. An experienced trader takes calculated risks over and over again. Hodling Bitcoin is actually riskier.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:18:57
I suggest you watch it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:21:20
"I deposit a check from a big bank"....as a Swede I don't even know what that means. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:09:17
A lot of people don't understand that correction is inevitable.

Trust me. A lot of people think this upward trend is going to keep going. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:23:28
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:43:59
Price should go up?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:08:32
He is so right. I wish I had never bought Bitcoin at those price points. (sarcasm)
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:49:20
History told me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:11:31
Don't talk bad about Bitcoin...they will find you...and they will kill you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:30
Where can I monitor the price?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:04:20
dot-com bubble....
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:47:39
Exactly. Winners will sell at 9999 to buy back at cheaper price.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:44:58
Is there a trading exchange that is also protected?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:58:00
Hopefully, you learned something about investing.

The comment that is relevant occurs at 01:18:22. Click the link and video will start at that time-stamp. He is basically saying that Bitcoin does not stand a chance against Bitcoin cash in terms of handling large amount of transactions.
