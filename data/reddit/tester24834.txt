I hate dogecoin. If I talk badly about it I get downvoted, even here in this subreddit. The dog is super fucking cute but that's the only thing I like about it. It's gotten an extreme amount of popularity in a very tiny fraction of time that BTC has had to expand, and to other people it is an attractive cryptocurrency because it's not serious, intimidating, and it's "funny." IF the young people flock to it, while the old flock to BTC, dogecoin will win out because the young are more tech savvy in general. I am admittedly terrified of dogecoin as an investor into BTC because people really only need one crypto in my opinion, and I have a strange feeling dogecoin will win out in the end. Young people are leaving Facebook possibly due to the old coming into it, and they will shun BTC as well if the old people and serious investors put money into it. The young are anti-establishment. Do not underestimate the power of that currency, it's growing in popularity leaps and bounds, the subreddit WILL overtake BTC's very quickly, it's got a lot of smart people behind it, etc.
EDIT: Look at that. 8 downvotes. Unreal.

If you have to ask, then you havent researched enough. And to answer your question there are 2 factors. If you think Bitcoin is gonna make it, buy now and hold. If you think the opposite. Never come back here again and do not buy because you will just end up being a panic seller. It doesn't matter if the price crashes to 300 tomorrow if it will go to 1k next year (Not a guarantee).

Bitcoin can adapt. If people are hesitant about getting into bitcoin, switching to an alt will be really rough. It's more efficient to just update bitcoin. This isn't myspace where you can simply find something new. Businesses and financial things will be more entrenched into btc to switch. But it's a possibility I admit. I hope I'll have the foresight to know when to switch if I truly need to but I hope I don't. I have a lot of faith in BTC hence my relativity large investment.

People talk about these daily to monthly fluctuations. Just wait 2-3 years, or one decade at the most. I'm holding no matter how low it goes. Cryptocurrency is definitely going to be the future (The genie is out of the bottle), and Bitcoin is the most likely candidate of all of the currencies to make it. So don't worry too much. If you want my true, honest opinion no matter what buttcoin or tulip futures or w/e say about me, I think everyone who owns at least 1 coin will be wealthy enough to not have to work for a veryyyy long time, within this decade.

I'm thinking tons of sales and money for the first week, then return to whatever normal is in Overstock land. BTC will get a 10 dollar boost, but will be brought down again via the Ghash news. We will see a small 100 dollar rally when some other company announces accepting BTC within the next month or so. Then we will see a significant drop as some catastrophic news comes out, or people will panic sell if there is no good news within a certain time period. By the end of February, we will be at 650 per BTC if were lucky. By the end of 2014, BTC will be a distant memory.

I have a feeling this will die down very quickly once the newness wears off. But this is the first actual good news that we've seen regarding BTC. This isn't 1 franchise out of thousands accepting BTC, this isn't some subsidiary that nobody uses (Galatic), this isn't some temporary product promotion (Galaxy phones in China). This is a real deal company accepting BTC. So I'm hopeful, but I will remain skeptical until a competitor or a large company with a more relevant user base (techies, young people) accepts the coins.

It's probably gonna end up like all the other "good news" we get around here. It's probably just some false rumor, or if it is true, the truth is gonna be only a fraction as good as it could have been. "Oh! Subway is accepting BTC now? Oh....1 Subway....in some cowtown...."

Something that nobody ever mentions with that graph is the mean is on the incline. So it'll take longer for the price to rise but just because the bubble pops doesn't mean the whole system is fucked.

@_date: 2014-01-09 22:10:14
I just find it hard to believe that everyone wouldn't be an early adopter. Let's say that 1 BTC will eventually be worth 1 million USD as some crazies have said, that means that TONS of people in the US would be half way to a million dollars just spending 400 bucks right now on half a Bitcoin... It's like everyone will get rich....doesn't make sense to me. I think were way past the early adopter stage because of this. Were the late-comers!
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:33:16
My only regret is that I'm out of money to buy coins at this opportune time.

Stop fooling yourself. This stopped being an experiment a long time ago. And just because I have invested what I can afford to lose alongside many others, that doesn't mean we look forward to and are not pained during a price drop.

I only said that because this not allowing withdrawals over 500 a day isn't a real argument for Bitcoin in my opinion. I don't know why you would actually need to withdraw that much and I don't give a fuck, but don't act like this is something that's a widespread problem.

Second world is an outdated term for the communist countries in the 20th century.

Nobody wants to get paid in BTC...BTC doesn't pay the bills. The vast majority don't give 2 shits about BTC. This is just some hobby for 15-20 year olds that got a bit of traction. It's too volatile to be used to pay people and I don't know of anyone who would want to be paid in it. They can just buy it themselves independent of the employer.

If the price goes high, and I have more money, so I'm willing to spend more as opposed to if the price is low, I have the same amount of money I did back in November and I have to be careful to not spend too much due to maybe an emergency payment or something. I think you're doing what a normal person would do. I have bought something, but I won't really start buying shit until the price rises (I'm not talking 1 million per I'm talking 5k+ per). I'm planning on buying airline tickets and hotel reservations as my first "real" purchases, but right now, that would drain the amount of BTC I currently have too much.

I have to agree with you. I think that Max talks so highly of BTC like it's blowing away the competition, changing the world, destroying the old guard, etc. when in reality it's not. It MIGHT have the potential to radically change our future, but CURRENTLY it's not doing anything special. Its own public perception is that it's a scam! We have a long way to go and watching people like Max go crazy for the BTC makes him seem like a desperate cult leader.

I 100% agree with OP. But the more posts we have like this, the more likely the Barbara Streisand effect comes into play. The Dogecoiners are so obnoxious, and yes, no matter how ridiculous the meme is, it is in fact a threat. Dogecoin is called by many Bitcoiners a novelty, a temporary fad, etc. but the difference is that this so called fad, makes people money, and it has come way too far, too fast to just ignore. LTC is in trouble, and BTC is the next station up.

Gotta warn consumers. This is why after the great depression rules (I know you don't like those) were put into place banning people who don't have a certain amount of money from investing in businesses, pre-IPO companies, etc. There would be a free for all otherwise, and millions would lose their shirts.

your balance and purchasing power are two different concepts bud. 10,000% growth unsustainable? Nothing is forever, but BTC is  barely known so there is a TON of room for growth. Facebook has 500 million users for comparison. If ONE single company can have that many users, I'm pretty sure this CURRENCY can at least grow a bit more. And with the growth of users, there is a growth in price.
"What makes you think America is anything like Cyprus, or Argentina, or whatever your next dumb strawman is" - What makes you think America is different than those countries? ANYTHING can happen.

I made a prediction in a blog post (my only one!) month ago regarding this. I predicted the Asian restaurants would be the ones to embrace BTC because they are always doing that cash-only/charge you extra for using cards/10 dollar minimum bullshit. So I went on coinmap right after looking at this post, and what do you know, the vast majority that accept BTC in my area (a major city) are Asian restaurants!
I think the second part of my prediction was that BTC would succeed (moon) not because of consumers, but because of the demand created by these small businesses, then followed by consumers. We will see if that one comes true soon enough.

If you think your investment is going to do nothing but rise to the moon with no signs of bad news along 
the way you need to use your brain. You pay a hefty price for stability and steady growth in "traditional and conservative" investments. You will gain over a very long time but you will never never ever gain anything significant enough to where you never have to work again. Bitcoin is going to rise but not in a straight shot. If it were that easy there would be no substantial gains. Fortress knows this and they aren't sweating bullets over this like the panicky high school kids on this subreddit that sell at the first sign off a drop.

To be honest I can't see another surge happening or any major investments until the 51% this is fixed permanently. Why would anyone, knowing the system has a gaping hole, willingly invest into this? This is going to keep people away. I don't even know if there is a fix for something like that considering that fix wouldn't benefit the greedy nature of humans.

The best part is, that this community can freaking move on. This whole Gox situation was the equivalent of your emotionally abusive girlfriend breaking up with you everyday, and then the next day getting back together with you. You may feel better in the short term, but in the long term you are only fucking yourself over and you are only prolonging recovery and making it harder to recover emotionally (price wise for BTC) once the relationship actually does end.

They have value because other people say they do. Someone else thinks their coins are worth 500 so why would I sell for less? And when I buy if someone sells for 400 why would I buy the 500? It's all a balance. And you can go mine yourself but it will cost you a lot of money and you won't get as many coins now as you would have back in the day for the same equipment cost.

"Overstock only does &gt;.1% of their business in BTC." This is why you are not a CEO. You aren't very forward thinking. Business is also about ousting your competitors at every corner, not letting them gain any traction, no matter now small.

I merely stated there is always a downside to every "good news" you see on your reddit feed. The Square thing is a great example. "Oh WOW (I fucking hate people that use this word in every title) Square is now allowing in-store brick and mortar swipes of BTC!" And then if anyone had bothered to read the article past the sensationalized headline they would realize that no that is not what is happening here. It's for their online crap only.
Just like "Oh WOW VIRGIN ACCEPTS BTC" and then you realize if you had read the news story, Virgin.......................................Galatic. The company that hasn't even sent 1 single fucking customer past 50,000 feet.
"WOW. HUGE NEWS GUYZ. STARBUCKS AND HEINEKEN ACCEPTING BITCOIN" Yeah, Starbucks was a fucking lie, and Heineken was literally a cruel joke. I think the quote via Twitter was "No not really."
"WOW. SUBWAY ACCEPTS BITCOIN!!!!".........................1 Subway franchise in the entire fucking world, and that franchise is in a developing country. Holy shit. Enough people. Enough with the fucking sensationalized headlines, and exaggerated news.

"The intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd."
- Benjamin Graham
In this case the crowd is the panic sellers.
"Unless you can watch your stock holdings decline by 50% without becoming panic-stricken, you should not be in the stock market."
- Warren Buffett
"Yes, risk-taking is inherently failure-prone. Otherwise, it would be called sure-thing taking."
- Tim McMahon
"The stock market is a no-called-strike game. You don't have to swing at everything--you can wait for your pitch. The problem when you're a money manager is that your fans keep yelling, 'Swing, you bum!'"
- Warren Buffett
The moral of the story is, don't sell. And if you can't handle this kind of heat, get the fuck out of Bitcoin.

I'm not even going to bother reading this article. BTC itself was considered a joke before, and look where it is now. Dogecoin could be the BTC killer for all we know. Bitcoiners are so hypocritical that they sound just like the banks and CEOs that criticized BTC. But in all seriousness, fuck Doge. I invest in BTC because I like what it stands for. Dogecoin is just riding the coat tails and is all about making money and jokes, rather than the deeper concept of changing the world and the way we do business. Doge very well may get to 1 dollar a pop, thus having a higher market cap than BTC, but that doesn't mean its well deserved.

How fucking stupid. These people make money off of volatility why is it all of a sudden a problem when BTC is the one that's volatile? If something is not volatile, it's not profitable. The reason most people apparently don't know this is because they aren't allowed to invest in anything volatile.
EDIT: one more thing. the big time investors make money off of potential, not what a company/asset/currency has already. There is no money to be made in already established things.

If you are looking for non-risky things, stick with your index funds. The trade off is you won't make anything significant, you'll barely beat inflation, but you should be in the black. BUT, if you are looking for a real return, and I mean a serious return, not some bullshit that you can expect from (conservative as fuck investing, where they think index funds are "high risk") you're in the right place. Bitcoin is really the only chance a person that is not a venture capital investor, or an accredited investor, can actually making a return on your investments that you can live off of. That you can retire off of. That you can LITERALLY become the richest person in town. The kinds of returns you can get in BTC are the kind you can get from investing in a startup, which you are barred from. Let that sink in people. This is your generation's gold rush. No holds barred, nobody putting a regulation brick wall in your face (SEC), no caps on growth, etc. This is the big time, and quite possibly, the only investment of its kind you will ever get to invest in. Me saying this isn't saying you are guaranteed to become a millionaire, but in all seriousness, this is probably your best bet at becoming one within the decade if this whole "experiment" succeeds.

I'm an amateur myself. But to me it's just logical that one would win out. I'd guess that deflationary would win from a normal person perspective as people don't want their savings devalued whereas governments who like a degree of control over the economy like inflationary. The us dollar and euro do not give people the choice of what I assume would be their go to currency. The masses aren't going to want "the silent tax" that is inflation so I think the deflationary would always win out given that the public has a choice which they now do with btc.

I'm saying they are wrong. Nowhere did Apple specifically mention Bitcoin. They said "approved virtual currencies." Why are people thinking they said Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:37:54
Because only an idiot would choose inherently inflationary currency over inherently deflationary currency given the choice. Me, nor anyone else is inspired to spend more because the USD/Euro/etc. is inflationary. I have never once gone to the store and said "Oh jee I'd better buy this cereal because my money will be worth less in a year."

My advice to you is don't look at this forum or anything bitcoin related until 2020. Buy a few coins put them in storage on paper and put that paper in the safest place on earth. Only buy the coins you can afford to lose USD wise. In 2020 you will either be a millionaire or exactly the same as you are now. There's more important things in life to worry about.

Christ I hate how the media talks down to people. "Please explain to us simple creatures." Or the classic "Bitcoin is difficult to understand/confusing" or "How can you expect anyone to use something so complex?"
This is the exact reason why Americans suck at math and science and we have to import all of our mathematicians and scientists from other countries. We talk down to our population and dismiss things as too difficult to comprehend. And the way the media talks about new inventions is just technophobic idiocy. Shut the fuck up about the difficulty of comprehension, and start educating your population.

I think you're missing my point. It's one thing to oppose BTC and make a post saying you don't like it...but you're entire Reddit career is about opposing BTC....for months if not years. If you don't like it just leave. I can only assume you are paid to stay and spread negativity. I don't like monarchism but I don't go on the monarchist subreddit every single day stating the downfall of monarchism for years on end...

You can share data all want, but then why do you call yourself a pirate? Why not say the tech party, or the progressive party? Pirates are murderers and thieves. There's no spinning that in a positive way. The word pirate isn't a neutral word. It has a very specific meaning. What the fuck do you think people are going to think about you if you call yourself something so controversial? If I say I'm a murderer or a gangster, I fully expect people to not treat me the same way as if I were to call myself a doctor or a carpenter.

The only thing that really concerns me is how he said that it can peacefully co exist with Paypal and the US dollar.

The network effect: Too many people and too much media attention in Bitcoin now. Bitcoin is also too adaptable and can change to survive in any competitive climate. The open sourceness is another plus, which a "company" will not do, and I think Bitcoin's purpose is to get away from centralization. And a company coin? Like what? QQ? E-gold? This is 2014, time to look at open source for the people by the people, not by McApple.

If the rocket runs out of fuel before leaving the stratosphere I would be concerned that the mission has been compromised. I don't have the funds to board another rocket, nor do I have the launch schedules to see when that next rocket will launch, if ever. Also, that next rocket might only allow accredited astronauts. I am so freaked out that I could be on a failing rocket, but I am so hopeful I'm still pressing all the buttons as if the mission proceeds as planned.

Your tax things are extremely scary. I do not like the idea of tax evasion, or the welfare state dying. And if this will take away taxes, that will only lead to Bitcoin being an enemy of the government, which nobody should want. The government will get it's money. It ALWAYS does.
You don't want Bitcoin to go underground. Most people don't like dealing in illegal or shady things. You could say "oh but people still download music illegally" but that pales in comparison to dealing with financial crimes, which I am pretty sure your average Joe isn't going to bother with.

People may steal music and buy MJ in high school even though they are underground, but doing underground financial crimes is a whole nother ball game.
2. There is no real incentive for consumers. a 5% discount isn't enough and not that many people send money overseas (And the bank fee isn't that high...)
3. It's 720 on Mt. Gox. Look at the Chinese exchanges which lead the prices. It's almost in the 500's and it's dropping.

The price of a share of something being 20 dollars as opposed to some astronomically high Berkshire Hathaway share doesn't keep me from investing in it. If the idea/company behind the thing being priced is good, that's what attracts investment. The only low confidence people have is in the price, not in the technology itself. And BTC is closer to 1k than to 0. By your logic there is a higher probability it will reach 1k.
