this prevents run on the bank kind of situations. This is a BFT solution to the run on the bank problem. Satoshi had predicted this.

Exactly. Par value of btc is possibly below $6k.
Yes, that's what it costs to mine: but miners also speculate that the price of the asset will go up, and that has to be accoutned in.

What makes you think I am a FUD account? Just because you disagree?
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:22:04
Because it's a house of cards, because of whales. Any pump is artificial based on tether, and mt gox as 165K bitcoin to dump. 
On top of that, most hodlers will sell at every increment (and ask others to hodl here)
Without organic adoption and growth this price is unsustainable. Don't forget that the main organic use (Darknet) doesn't exist anymore, since people use privacy alts for such transactions.

Today bitcoin made circle of imagination pattern. It mean, from here only two paths possible. Either moon or down. We all know this. Then why we here? What this circle tell us? 
The answer is in your imagination. Close eye. Deep breath. Then ask - ask yourself. Ask your good friend. Ask your enemy. Ask your family. If you conscious, talk to your dog. Build your imagination first. Then think chart. Then think price. First imagination. Then chart.

Bitcoin is die. Bitcoin is life. You can't predict both. It is like yin and yang. Like sweet and spice. 
Wait for golden petal of life formation under graph and then wait. Price will be achieved. Goals achieved. Great life. Enjoy life.

fast and slow is not real. in your head. do smell test with finger to first know what is real before you can open gates of chakra, dear sir. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:25:57
Yeah. Heading south from here. We've seen this pattern before.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:25:14
Price too high too low don't matter. You look into your soul first. The chart don't tell you truth. You first activate sage mode by opening all gates of chakra. In the chart you see chakra first. Chart comes from chakra. Cha - k - ra. Then becomes chart. Don't put all faith in chart, but do read chart. Don't act with fait at all. Act with judgment and vigoursouly victory will come to you. If you think price go down, you sell. Otherwise hodl. Victory is yours. Just follow heart but also read chart

This rich were responsible for capital allocation to improve productivity. They failed. Now in place of giving up their positions, resigning etc, they continue to kill people's savings by printing money. 
You are on the bitcoins sub. We are all capitalists here, and no one hates rich people. People who commit fraud should go to jail though. People who are shit at their jobs, should be fired.
After the GFC - it would have been justice, if  80% of financial regulators were fired.

Check the polarity of your daily chakra before buying. 100% guarantee success in trading. 
Chakra polarity tell you whether there is support or not at price level, by sensing pulse of the market. Ancient trick. Very popular from ancient trading times and routies in China and Asia - now the land of cryptocurrency.
To test your chakra polarity, first wash your left finger to make sure no smell. Then with clean finger right finger scratch your rectum and with your left finger scratch eitehr your vagine or your rectum, or the closest organ you think you have to either. If left finger smell like ass and right finger smell like gold, then great. If not, repeat experiment only once more. This time record in phone camera your reaction when you smell. If no one to help you to record, then no need to record. 
Now follow this table:
Left Finger Smell: Ass: Right Finger Smell: Gold: Either Hodl or you Sell. 
Left Finger Smell: Ass: Right Finger Smell: Ass : You made mistake in experiment. Right finger never in ass.

Doesn't help to announce release of lightning at every dump. Just let it crash.Work on lightning adoption and development in place of PR
But no - let's do yet another lightning beta release PR

Finally, tower of hanoi formation completed today.
In the last few weeks, all news and technical analysts confirm price will move for next few days. All this is consistent with elliot-wave theory. 
First, bitcoin price crossed 3, 4 digit magic numbers at least twice, i.e. $7777, $8888, $9999 forming newton's triangle. Multiple green candles at magic numbers as well as head n shoulders confirms above.
Going forward, trade carefully, but confidently as there is great news. Europe has found solution to immigration problem using blockchain technology today, so no need for brexit. China Tigers, new hedge fund from China will work with Chinese government to use blockchain technology on chinese currency, and decentralize chinese nodes. A bitcoin hardfork in the USA has been announced which makes Shapeshift secure. 
If you don't want to mine bitcoin, now is a great time.

When you buy front then you don't hodl back. You look for cougar in the club with sleeve of wizard. you give alt coin in the sleeve. With real coin you hodl and train mind to see truth in the chart. 
Many will say take short cut in life and trading. No. Don't work. Alway do proper, stand straight, tuck your shirt in. Be gentleman.

But man must take risk. How else can he be man? When third risk taken, triangle of determination formed. From there, only moon in lambo. No need to hodl. Just sit in lambo and drive. GPS take you to moon.
