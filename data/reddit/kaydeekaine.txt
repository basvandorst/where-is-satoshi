30 million Americans old and rich enough to spend money on this scam industry? Sounds like bs

This is sad. A lot of people will be left behind in tears. Nobody does anything about it and by then it will be too late. They're not just stealing your pension money to fill budget gaps, they're literally gambling with other people's retirement funds.

Knowing this, it baffles me to see how many people do not opt out of their pension plan. It's just one giant gambling pot and by the time you and me are going to need it, it'll be empty.

Tether is the twin brother of the Federal Reserve. Both print and lend money made out of thin air at an interest whilst profiteering from their monopoly.
