So. You have called?
Literally no one here is going to know. Call the bank, dude

You don't want to call because you're what? Afraid? 
Call, dude. What's the worst that'll happen?
How have you figured payroll out, but not a checking account. So odd....

Seriously. I think this is a joke thread?

terrible advice.  how is one supposed to improve if they don't study their past failures and successes.
i understand the sentiment you're trying to convey and avoid, but I'd suggest you attempt to control your emotions instead of ignoring the data around you.

And what if the market returned 100% while you take your money out at 20% gains?
You're not scenario planning which is a key to investing. Point is, there is no one right answer. Taking gains may or may not be right. 
I'm more interested in maximizing the performance of my investments instead of setting seemingly arbitrary percentage goals
E: since we're in this sub : would you have taken gains at btc 1200 if you bought it at 1000? Would you be completely happy you missed out on a 10x run and then say to yourself, that's perfect, there's nothing else I could have done better to improve my investments performance? These opportunities are not frequently repeated and one must know how to squeeze the maximum value from them

The visa network has many more controls built into it than bitcoin currently does (eg limits, fraud checks, etc)

And? 
You've come to this joke btc subreddit for. . . ?

You are thinking short term.  Expand your time horizon.  Ever heard the saying don't keep all your eggs in one basket?  If the Greek held their assets in multiple forms (digital and real) like I mentioned, this bank run would be almost a non issue.
Even if the euro goes tits up, with a basket based approach only part of one's assets are exposed to a catastrophic failure like you mention.  
Like I said, the game is about effective risk management. 
But hey. Keep being an ignorant pleb, bitcoin purist like most on this subreddit and refuse to work the rest of the world.  You should build your own country on your digital currency without the use of banks.  That'll work really well.

And what makes you an authoritative source? Hmm?
Your attitude is typical of block chain elitists and this subreddit . . . Can't recognize that the transition is going to be gradual instead of big bang.  
The banks out there are going to show you something in the next few years . . . a block chain based ledger for traditional banking assets.  All those lovely derivatives you people hate will be even more pervasive.  It'll change the world, but it has nothing to do with bitcoin itself.  The banks are going to co-opt the technology you are clinging to.  And you're all missing the boat.

Until someone cracks the block chain protocol (in the next few decades).  
The only real way to reduce risk here is to hold savings in multiple fiat, physical and digital currencies.  And even then, managing risk across a basket like that will be complex.  
Block chain alone is not the answer.

Back atcha, bud
Or is that one word again? Hmm
