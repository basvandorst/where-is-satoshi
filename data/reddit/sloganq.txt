This is good, though requires a customer to download an app for each vendor. This may be convenient for regulars but it is inconvenient for non-regulars and personally I don't want to download like 10+ payment apps.
We need to take this thought to the next level and generalize this so that a bitcoin user can utilize one app and make purchases at multiple locations regardless of weather or not they have been there before.
I think this is important because bitcoin is a good currency to use for traveling. Dealing with specialized apps while traveling is just not a good option for most people.

People keep going on about percent; It's about magnitude as well. A 75% drop is not allot if the magnitude lost is small, whereas a drop at large price magnitudes tend to do more damage.

3-year peak? Gimme a break! This is an All Time High!! Uncharted and clear skies from here; no price ceilings besides the growth trend band.

We've had practice with PBOC bonking bitcoin. Also, everybody planned on buying the dip. There's actually no real reason to sell at all. Nothing bad happened, the status quo hasn't changed; we just missed a good opportunity and that's not a reason to sell at all.

Is this BTC or ETH? they look the same right now. Bitcoin has been performing solidly for years.

Looks like Paypal is doing pretty good right now. I mean the wild west is doing great, even after police and governments took over. Maybe Bitcoin not being so wild would not be the worst thing. Worst case is a ban but I don't see that as being what will happen; I see regulation being applied ans Bitcoin grows in the economy just like we should have always expected.

Autonomous cars can drive for Uber (or similar) while you're not using them. Bitcoin can be used for payment at least; perhaps blockchain technology could establish identity to allow specific users only.
To take it a step further, we could make autonomous refueling/recharging stations that can accept bitcoin.
What if most people drove and shared autonomous cars this way?

Should I rephrase my question?
'When are we going to be able to use Bitcoin to buy Groupons?'
I think this is a valid subreddit for this question as bitcoin is a currency and is used to buy stuff.... Though tagging in with the Groupon subreddit would be a good idea. I wish we could post in multiple subreddits with a single post; that's really whats needed for the essential cross-over conversation that need to take place.

The psychology behind this picture may compel people to sell. I mean, the cart is at the best sell point and foretells a tail of hodlers remorse. I would replace with a picture of the cart already going down because that's where we're at currently 4 hrs later.

Could we make a cloud mining network with software built into bitcoin wallet apps so that a fraction of each devices computing power adds up to some serious mining power? I mean there could be a network of millions of processors contributing in parallel; that has to be useful, right?

Giving someone cash is essential promoting the ideals of the united states government. Not saying theres anything wrong with that. But basically, if you give anybody anything, it will be related to ideas and beliefs in some way. This is a free country, expressing and promoting your beliefs is supported, forcing others to accept them is not.

Banks are 'for profit' organizations who 'hold' our money for us. How could they make decisions which could hurt them yet be beneficial for all of us, i.e. support Bitcoin. They are self biased.

Are you seriously implying that the only thing you could spend bitcoin on is karate and subway? 
Google "Places to spend Bitcoin" and you will find a ridiculous amount of results.
