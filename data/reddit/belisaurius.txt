Honestly, that would be a challenge culturally. But I like your spunk. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:53:39
You believe that you can draw a forward line from historical data into the future? And you think I'm using a crystal ball? 
I guess it's easier to just hope for the best than do anything else.

I can't give you time frames. All I can say is that banking on very limited financial offering having massive consumer buy-in isn't feasible.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:30:33
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:18:37
Yes. There simply isn't the population to grow into. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:04:39
Sure. It's not surprising that a niche market product has success as it enters the mainstream. That supports a limited period of exponential growth. I'm simply saying that there is a hard market cap on the number of consumers of crypto currency users and aspiring to infinite exponential growth is... not really rational; particularly over the time frame we're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:58:07
This is money we're talking about. I like your ideas, particularly the second one (Robot rights is a no-no to me), but they shouldn't be the basis for decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:48
The number of people who actively invest in the stock market is very small. There are a large number of people who have some of their net worth involved in the stock market, but that's not an active process since it's mostly retirement funds and whatnot. 
I'm not discounting it. I'm simply saying that there is a maximum potential userbase that's much, much smaller than the population of the Earth and projecting continued value growth as if everyone who's currently breathing will "buy in" is nonsense. 
It has value as a deflationary investment body, but not much else; and certainly not at the breathless scale some people here seem to keep talking about.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:27
My argument is that, while there may be limited periods of technically exponential growth over short time frames, it's pretty inane to characterize the expansion of cryptocurrency userbase as 'exponential' and it absolutely makes no sense to project future userbase growth from that baseline *particularly* as it applies to potential value down the road.

Sure, but access to the internet is only one small part of the puzzle. People need *money* to be a part of the crypto currency system. More importantly, crypto needs to *do* something for you. It doesn't help the billions of people who almost never use formal money and, even with internet, extremely limited capital. 
In some ways, crypto currency is the ultimate expression of privilege. It relies on the continued peaceful existence of every major industrialized country to maintain the internet that motivates it. It relies on people who can comfortably sock money away into deflationary systems without suffering undo daily hardship. **And** it requires a free government. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:59:07


There is fundamentally no way that this happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:26:56
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:34:29
Look. I know that it sounds really nice to consider that kind of growth, but we should realize a couple things: first, only a reasonable minority of internet connected westerners even have money set aside in savings. Second, only a small fraction of them are directly involved in investing at all. Third, cryptocurrency will never take the place of traditional currency (for a variety of reasons we can talk about), meaning it won't compete in a meaningful way for the attention of normal people. 
That leaves cryptocurrecy exactly one group of people who care about it: those who need or want alternate investment bodies for their cash. That's probably only the top 1% of all people in the west, or something like a hundred million people. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:55:17
Okay well. I wish you luck. I hope you got in early. Buying into inherently deflationary investment bodies is good for the early adopters and no one else. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:29:35
I mean, I don't mind those ideas. I'm just being realistic. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:28:34
Sure, but there's fundamentally no way that crypto currencies reach the majority of that seven billion anytime in the next 25 years. Not only is the number of internet connected people much lower than that, and unlikely to change without massive outside investment; the number of people who know about/will care about obscure investment vehicles within the overall number of potential consumers is even lower than that.

Uh, yes they do. Police Officers have the right to arrest you. The IRS has the right to Tax you. The Fish and Game Service has the right to kick you off federal land. 


The enforcers of the law aren't the ones who wrote it. **We all** think we know how to run your life better than you. 


Mmm, we'll have to disagree. There's a fundamental difference between interpersonal behavior and the framework of civilization. It's immoral for me to use force on you. It's not immoral for the state to. 


Yes, actually. You didn't even do the bare minimum that a citizen is expected to. You are *literally* irrelevant. 


What a terrible analogy. Not only is taxation hilariously unrelated to slavery; the point is that non-voters have no right to question the consequences of votes. 


Um, yes we did. That's how representative democracy works. 


Again, it's like you don't get how this works. 


Hawkward that we don't live in direct democracy for exactly this reason. It's technically a constitutional republic. 


Well good thing it doesn't work like that. 


I mean, you might not have consented but the founders did. Your citizenship is a defacto continuous acceptance. Feel free to relinquish it at any time. 


They volunteered. 


I take the responsibility of power very seriously, but this is a different conversation that the one we're having about the role of government. 


If they do, feel free to take them to court. 


Feel free to engage in politics, Mr. Non-Voter. 


No sir. I prefer modern society because I think the progression of the systems of laws we use to maintain stable civilization is better now than it has ever been. The technology is just a symptom of the thing I like most: progress. 


Which is why we live in a constitutional republic that has freedom of religion. No one is a god, because *we* are. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:53:06


My apologies. I was reading too much into it. 


Yeah, because that's what it is. You don't necessarily opt in, since I presume you're a natural born US Citizen; but it is voluntary since you can opt out. 


I mean, it's only "forced" in the sense that the opt-out option is godawful and no one who likes things like the internet, or running water, would choose to opt out. What you're really talking about is that you don't like where the money is spent. And that's fine, but that's a political issue not a consent issue. You signed away your consent by choosing to continue as a citizen. 


We have two essential options: delegate the use of force to the state or retain it. In the former case, you have the world around you with laws that cover all use cases of force. In the latter, you get to deal with the concept of your neighbor being stronger than you so he gets to take what you have without anyone else being concerned. 


Unfortunately, great ideas like the equality of man and the concept of the rule of law absolutely need stalwart defenders who are willing to use force to maintain the core ideals. We've seen, historically, what happens when that fails. We get people like Mussolini, or Hitler, or Stalin. People who are entirely selfish and are willing to buck ideas in favor of their version of the world. 
At no point have I said this is a perfect system, solely that it is the best way to maintain core freedoms without resorting to barbarism. 


I don't see how this works. Services need to be paid for. Some people can't pay, but deserve those services. 


This is wrong. We live in a capitalist economy. The only things that get done are the ones with a profit margin. Some things do not have a profit margin, or shouldn't. For instance: we shouldn't extract profit from prisons. More fundamentally though: some things are way too large for the market to capitalize and deal with the profits, yet they remain necessary. 
I specifically pointed out the Interstate system for a reason. It's a *service* that only We The People could afford. It's the backbone of our modern society and it was the most expensive public works ever undertaken in the history of the world. It's not a profit making venture and it couldn't have ever been done as successfully by a private organization. Yet, it also has massive secondary economic impacts that make it incredibly valuable in the abstract. 
The same is true of NASA and our space programs. There is no direct profit to be extracted from it, but there's massive secondary benefits. 
On a more abstract note, though: What room does your system have for the collective work on advancing science and technology? Sure, maybe you don't like certain facets of the welfare state; but I'm more than happy to tell anti-science people to stuff it while we fund cutting edge research that advances the livelihoods of everyone around the globe. 
I appreciate that you feel like the sweat of your brow is being mismanaged. I think that's a very very common thing for people of mutual consent societies. We can and should do more to make our government better and ensure it comes closer to its ideals. But let's not pretend that you're being held against your will. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:29:55


That's not how society works. We all decide what to prioritize. You aren't more important than anyone else and your voice doesn't count more than anyone else's. 


No, not just "people". It's "The People". If you don't like the people involved, then do it yourself. 


Then you don't understand why we delegate the use of force to the state. It will **always** have the power of coercion over you and everyone else. That's its most core function. You're essentially trying to buck the basic building blocks of civilization. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:06:23


They have special powers because we give the offices they hold powers. Not that hard to grasp. The IRS guy is allowed to do what he does because we all told him to do it. 


I mean, you voted right? In which case you did have something to contribute to the decision. If you didn't vote, then you're not exercising your enfranchisement and so you have zero room to complain. 


No, no. They *tax* it based on the guidelines that the majority has decided. If you don't like democratic rule by majority, then feel free to leave. 


We all did. You might not like it, and neither do I, but your means of remediation are clear and obvious. If you choose not to take them, that's on you. At the end of the day; we live in a consensual society and what other people choose to do is just as valid as your choices. 


Actually, it is. In this world, you have rights. Those rights cannot be abrogated by anyone, including the government. Feel free to exercise them in any way you see fit. If you don't like the *responsibility* that comes with those rights, that's on you. I happen to prefer it this way in comparison to, you know, all of the rest of human history. 
For instance; the internet is only possible because of what we've built via that civilization you dislike so much. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:42:19


The rule of law isn't about morality; it's about the letter of the law. Morality is and will always be relative. There is no room for relativity  in justice. 


Um, I specifically said **we** for a reason. The collective does know how to run your life better than you do in certain ways. For instance; the collective believes you should save for retirement. It makes sure you do that by taking some of your pre-tax income and setting it aside for you. The collective does that to ensure it doesn't become wholly responsible for you in your old age. Pretty much everything else about society follows that same vein. If you don't want to be beholden to your fellow citizens, as I keep saying, please leave. 


Mmm, the difference between slavery and non-slavery is whether you're a voluntary participant, not the percentage of your labor that's redirected to other ends. If you choose to unvolunteer, you can do that. 


That's a different conversation, but working based on the ideals of the system, they represent us, yes. 


Again, morality is  subjective and unrelated to the rule of law. 


Again, no, we don't. 


Is it my problem that the whole world operates like this? No sir. If you want to live somewhere without these rules, you can do that. Set up a shack in Somalia and have at it. Again, this is strictly voluntary. 


Again, morality is subjective. You cannot argue, in a court of law, based on morality. You can do that in a political forum where the law is made, but certainly not in a courtroom. Also, the fact that you're slandering the impressive nature of the judiciary is pretty sad. 


So, instead of working to change that via the system that's in place to create change; you're going to sit on the outside and whine? How is that productive. Whether you want to or not, the maintenance of your citizenship is defacto support for the violent domination you despise. Your very existence is tacit support. 


Mmm, no. Progressive ideals came first and set up the infrastructure that allowed technological development. It's even obvious from the historical record that this is so. 


Is the collective America not godlike? Really? We're pretty much omnipotent on this planet. We certainly know most things that are going on. We have the power to obliterate everything if we wanted to. We, the collective, are immortal as well; since ideas cannot die. We check many of the boxes for "deity".

Not really and particularly not at the scale that the interstate is. Moreover, gating public services for the wealthy only is a sincere problem vis-a-vis equality. There's also the safety standards issue. 


Horrific analogy. Absolutely awful. A car, or any piece of industrial consumer product isn't a *service*. More than that, it's not about complication in the micro; it's about complication in the **macro**. Building interstates requires an entity that his wealthy enough and uninterested in time that it can overcome the challenges. It needs something with the right to purchase any piece of land and use it for the public good. These things are not accomplishable by private industry with sufficient attention paid to the future. 


There's not enough private money for this; particularly not considering the military elements of the whole thing. 


Much like the government opening up the west (let's not talk about the morality of that); space is only a commercial profit center because of the groundbreaking work done by government scientists with government money. The satellites that those companies put into space are direct descendants of the government ones NASA put into space in the 70s, 80s and 90s. 


Fair. 


It's nice of you to completely ignore the *bad* elements of unrestricted capitalism: let me list some: wage slavery, monopolies, public safety and health hazards. 


This so cynical. You're trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Yes, we have failures of the system, that doesn't mean the system is entirely broken. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:07:37


Wrong. Absolutely and fundamentally wrong. 


I mean, you're aggressively misinterpreting what I said, but sure. It's the best we got. Do you have some other method that works better?


You can unvolunteer at any time. You also happen to lose your rights at the same time, since it's all one package. 


Are people who Tithe to their church slaves of their church? No, they're voluntary members. You can choose to leave the world that allows you to make money, you can choose to relinquish your responsibilities and your rights. 


You're really trying for the "absolute universal morality" argument? Do you really need me to underscore how radically morality has shifted in the past and how it will shift in the future?


I don't happen to like FPTP voting; I'd rather something different. But the reality is as it is. Doesn't help that people like you don't even bother. 


You don't *have* to. But you can't stay here and not follow the rules. That's how sovereignty works. Why should I leave? I like it here and I'm uninterested in how China does what they do. 
The world doesn't care about your morality; it cares about its own.


Yes, they're human. Which is why we have laws, why we have multiple layers of courts and why we have the system we do today, to reduce that human element to as small as it can be. 
Feel free to ask any of the thousands of happily married gay people why suing the legislative and executive branches in the judicial branch is a good idea.  


Your version of morality doesn't mean anything to anyone if you don't vote. If you want no part; then leave. 


What I'm saying is that free, voluntary citizens support the system that they like. If you prefer parliamentary democracy, feel free to move to one of those countries. If you prefer open dictatorship, you can move to one of those. You are here of your free will and you're deluding yourself if you don't believe that. 


Factually wrong. Government creates things like the interstate system and other larger projects that no one man can do. It's the collective will of the people; which is capable of much greater things than any one of us. Please point to the man who could put himself on the moon in the 1960s. 


Thank you. 


Great, you and me both. 


I don't necessarily appreciate the slight aimed at my intelligence, but thank you none the less. 


I give my government the license to do this. If I break the laws that I know exist to protect me, then I deserve the consequences. I am a voluntary and consensual member of this society. 


It's not stealing if I give it to them willfully. I want them to do right with it, and so I engage in politics to ensure such a thing. But please don't characterize *my* taxes as theft. I'm represented. My small voice is heard alongside everyone else's. I am a proud signatory of the social contract. 


Nope. Slavery is about voluntary versus involuntary toil; not the amount taken. 


Again, it's not theft because this is voluntary. 
Look, dude. I get that you don't like that there's a framework of rights and responsibilities that go with citizenship. As I keep saying to you: if you don't like the responsibility of supporting the country via some percentage of your work then please feel free to leave. You have fundamental rights, ones that will not be infringed by anyone. If it wasn't clear enough: one of them is freedom to renounce your membership in our society. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:19:15


Except it's not just me, it's the entirety of the country; one that gives him rights in return for a measure of responsibility. It's not some secret scam, it's right out there in the open. It's called a social contract. 


Mmm, no we didn't. Government is essential for providing services in areas where no profit margin is possible (e.g. anywhere outside of cities). To this day, rural infrastructure is heavily subsidized by urban areas. If you want a society where the only people who experience progress are the wealthy and/or their immediate neighbors, you probably want no government taxation.
