I understand completely.  We are following part 1 of the rule already (our large, recognized charity is the ALSA), and I will provide more information regarding our nonprofit foundation, and hopefully through our communication with the ALSA we can also prove our trustworthiness by pre-sponsoring an event, or a Walk to Defeat ALS.  Please come back soon, and tell your friends!

Thank you for the information.  The large charity we are benefitting is the ALS Association (  We have registered as a nonprofit organization in Ohio.  Just waiting on the ID # and confirmation.  We are also in contact with alsa.org Gift planning and Media relations, and hopefully they will provide us with a means of proving our legitimacy.  I will keep you updated, and thank you for your kind words.

Just to make this clear, this post is following the rules.  It is for a large and recognized charity (ALSA.org).  Will provide proof of trustworthiness ASAP.  Advice would be appreciated on how best to do so.  I have asked ALSA contact if they will be willing to post picture of them receiving check for $50, also asking about official partnership options, waiting to hear back.

This is a worthy cause.  The first beta tester of Bitcoin has ALS.  Please show your love and support for him, and all those who are suffering from this terrible disease.
Edit: Removed "Please don't downvote", as I understand now why it was being downvoted.  I hope anyone who has an opinion, positive or negative, will post here first, before passing judgement.  Thank you for reading this little note :D
