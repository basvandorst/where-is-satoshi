I just don't get people emotion...  We have an almost perfect and hacked proof cryptocurrency system but may still need some improvement (regarding fee and speed...).  This is a world different than what we currently have available from the banking and financial systems.  Despite with the obvious gain and benefits in front us, many people are still complaining, whining, scared, fearing, and panicking...
When will people stop being such spoiled children ? and allow the bitcoin/ blockchain revolution to take shape and enhance our life and future generations ??
Stop biting the hands that feed you ! Seat back and let the resolution take place!

Here we go again MR. Smarty paints:  you Sir obviously are not a man of science:  
Your entire argument presented without a single proof of data or evidence to back your statements.  You use a lot of "could", "potentially", "absolutely" without anything to substantiate your points !! 
Are you a freaking third grade student ? How the hell do you think scientists predict the future event without historical data MR. Genius ??  By keep repeating "could", "potentially" and "absolutely" like you do ??
If you want to make your case,  PROVE it !!

You said "Chances are that it increase by more than that. I doubt there's that much bitcoin available for sale at any price on all the exchanges right now. "
Seem like we are both big supporters of BTC - But, How did you come up with the statements above:  "no bitcoin available for sale at any price right now" really? are you sure  ? " an influx of $0.25T would do to the market cap".  MR. Know it all, please show some data ?

Who care don't touch them.. I only buy BTC and Eth - the real stuffs
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:18:16
Let's look at it this way:  some people, including John McAfee predicted that bitcoin will reach $500,000 in three years.  So that's 61.5 times from it's current value of -~ $8000.  So your $200 investment today would become $12,300
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:49:02
I concur that !

 I live outside of San Francisco (where Coinbase is located).  But I absolutely despise their BS - I use Gemini, much better service, much faster and lower fees.
I recommend to dump  Coinbase ( a bunch of arrogant SOBs) and signup with Gemini.

Sorry I didn't read all the comments and somebody may have pointed it out.  Hashing powers are being wasted more than just $20/ transaction.  You are only taking into account of the "winning" node -  what about many nodes that did not win in the competition?  There are lots more nodes burning the electricity that didn't win than a single miner whose happen to win - right ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:07:01
Congratulations !  And welcome to a very exciting time.  According to John McAfee ( the founder of the security software), your $100 investment will be come $6150 within 3 years or he will eat his dick on national television ��

Well I had to jump through hoops and waited about two weeks to finally open an account with Coinbase.  Then I bought some sleeping pills (with prescription), they immediately closed my account without telling me the reason why...
I tried a second time, they made me wait for about two weeks and then sent me an email to tell me that I cannot have an account with them - once again with no reason explained.
I'm not the only person whose being subjected to this treatment - all my coworkers from work went through the same thing...they all moved over to Gemini and being happy ever since...
I also remember watching a movie about bitcoin, and  remember the Ass..le CEO indicated that he would completely cooperate with the government and the banks so he could avoid being shutdown like other exchanges.,,
Btw, Gemini typically takes a day or less to link to your bank and after that I can instantly transfer cash over to Gemini and buy coin instantly , even the usd deposit may take up to five days to clear- no waitting for you.  The condition is you cannot sell until the bank transfer is clear..,fair enough for me..,
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:02:43
Exchange fee - blockchain was also low too. The blockchain fee was $2.3, which by calculation, it is so far below any bank fees
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:36:59
Yep I did that ��. I bought some at $7800 ��
Btw, I'm not sure why the complaint about high fees and taking a long time-  all BS...I have my account with Gemini.  It took literally less than a second and they charged $1.2 in fee.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:47:33
Are you kidding ? $2300 worth of BTC is a lot for anybody...we are all very proud of you for being such a mature and forward thinker at your young age !!  When We were at your age, we were too busy trying to get trunk and get laid ��
According to John McAfee, in three years your investment will become ~ $150,000.  Let us all keep our fingers crossed - and best of luck !!

Dip vs tank.  What's the difference ?
What do you think the term Hold On to your Dear Life (HODL) means ??
You're missing the point:  yes the price you buy at matter - but you don't get to choose the price you want to buy too often.  What if you set the btc to sell at 7000 and everyone and their grand mothers jumped in within 1 hour it shoots back above 10k.  What are you going to do ?
Now you feel like an idiot to pay extra 2k to recover your coins 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:52:20
Why would you short BTC if it potentially could go up to $100,000s ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:48:29
The dip happens very quickly, sometimes in hours.  Plus transaction delays, lockdowns, etc...on top of that I'm not sure if there are any big dips any more.  My advice is to buy small amount frequently, and if there's dip, buy big.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:20:31
Bubble is often being referred to a saturated market, where there are too much supplies and not enough justification for demand:
1). The BTC is hardly the case of the bubble.  Currently, there are ~ approximately 16 millions bitcoin ever existed.  Satoshi I was told to hold 1 million BTCs...how many people in the world do you think actually own BTC ?  I think not too many...
2). We have over six billions people around the world.  And if I remember correctly, there are approximately 4 billion people whose live in the developing countries that don't even have a bank account.  As of the other 2 billion people, including myself are stuck with financial institutions whose only goal in life is to take control of people's money and make profit from it..,
3). I'd argue that BTC and other cryptocurrencies  are merely at its infancy and still have a lot of growing up to do.  
In my humble opinion-  bitcoin bubble is actually a good bubble - it serves humanity.
So everyone, please join our revolutionary fight of the life time.  Stop being so scared- the will of the people will always triumph over greed, corruption and bad actors...
I love to hear that young people are actively engage in cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-  the future is truly belong to you !!

I always wonder how many females are on this community.  I'm glad we have some smart sisters are taking part of this adventure.  Couple minor corrections:
1). Cold Storages are devices, which are not connected to any network, servers or Internet  - could be a pc or laptop that specifically only use for bitcoin and not to be connected to the internet.  Trazor and Ledger Nano S are not Cold Storage - they are Hard Wallet.  Paper Wallet could be considered a Cold Wallet because, by itself, it doesn't directly connect to the internet.
2). "HODL" is not a miss spelled word.  It actually mean = Hold On to your Dear Life.

First of all BTC has very little, or at least not any direct connection with inflation or deflation.  BTC, up to this point does not directly causing the US monitory system to become inflated or deflated - at least not just yet.  For example, if the Fed print too much US dollars or too many people get high wages (not likely the case) and not enough goods to fulfilling the orders (purchasing) then the cost will rise - thus inflation occurs...this is where BTC comes in, people will move their hard earned money to BTC against inflation.  Soon nobody will use the Fiat currency - that is when we see the end of banking system and the Fiat currencies.
Btw, in many developing countries, people have already moved their money to BTC due to inflation - already happening.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:37:56
The word "equilibrium" should not be used any where near BTC (at least in the foreseeable future).  Have you seen the BTC market last several years ? This f**ker is moving like a bullet train...

I have already answer this same question to a 16 years old -  you are behind by one year ��
"  No you are not too young nor you are too late at all ! You are a smart and forward thinker and your parent should be very proud of you...
Having saying that, you are a very green and inexperienced person, and you should be extreme careful about where you are putting your money into.  Here's our advice to you:
1). Spend a lot of times to do research and understand bitcoin/ blockchain.  You have already found your way on this forum - that is smart and a good start.  Ask a lot of questions if you are unclear or not sure about any subject.  There are many good and decent grownup here, whose will be more than happy to help you.
2). Extra careful, even smart adults are often get scam from this roller coaster ride.  When in doubt ask- never quickly believe the first response.  Alway check and double check !
Good luck, some day you will be a successful person !!  "

Some people whose invested in bitcoin don't have a fundamental understanding of its "radically disruptive" nature.  Human by nature don't do exponential - we are a linear creatures.  When it come to exponential growth, it often freaks ordinary persons out.
History has shown, few great men whose see the exponential growth to capture and pursue the opportunities: 
Bill Gate, whose thought that each house should a personal computer - pretty radical idea during the time that only main frame computer could be powerful enough to carry out any serious computation..
Steve Jobs believed that any individual should be able to carry in their pocket a computer like device that, all by the way can take beautiful pictures, carry all your music library, and can communicate anytime, anywhere as they wish...
Here's is the video [Andreas Antonopuolos on exponential growth of bitcoin]( 
Let me give a very brief point of why bitcoin exponential growth is very real and sound:
I will not repeat the obvious Radical Disruptive nature of bitcoin and blockchain.  Quite frankly I am getting to the point where I'm so tire to explain all these fundamentals.  After this, please do what ever the heck you choose.  If you don't feel warm and fuzzy inside then please do all us a favor: stay the heck out of the exciting revolution that is on the way !
1). Out of approximately 6 billions people currently on earth, there are only 2 billions have a bank account .  The existing financial institutions (banks, financial services) are all out to control your money and make profit on your hard earned cash.  But, the said thing is there are approximately 4 billions people in the development countries do not have a bank account (not bankable) due to high fee, regulations, governmental control.
2). Governments control wealth leads to corrupt and harmful to civil liberty...this is currently happening now...
Please stop thinking that bitcoin and blockchain are no longer capable of growth exponentially - it's simply not true at all !!  This is just a beginning- we have just simply scratched the surface...
I'm so tired, I no longer want to talk about this subject ever again...if you you get it, you get it.  If you don't, just move on with your life and stay off this progress...

What kind of Mac computer do you have ?  Normally, macs are more secured than Windows...sorry to hear your loss, you seems to be very determined, a good ingredient for success.  Whoever stole your coin had gotten themselves a very bad Karma - it will follow and hunt him (or her) down for the rest of their miserable life - don't worry, nature will take care of it...
Keep your coins on the exchange while your are waiting (temporarily) for the hard wallet is fine, so long as you have a secondary password through another portable device.
Good luck you will be just fine !

Here we go again: a bunch of blind men talking about the white elephant.
I am a huge BTC fan but I am also a bit annoyed by all the speculations...
You don't need a lot of BTCs to trade.  It's a basic principle of Supply vs Demand:  meaning, if the price gone up high enough, somebody will be willing to sell.  Conversely, if the price goes down low enough, somebody will be willing to cut their lost and sell.
And please, do not say that we need to make more bitcoin beyond 21 millions - I will blow my head off ��

@_date: 2017-11-17 06:11:42
If you stored your btc in Trezor classic account - you can recover your coins on Electrum ( provided that you still have your 24 words seeds).  If you don't have your 24 words seeds - you are screwed...
It happened to me when Trezor decided to update the software.  
You could also reset your Trezor, update the software and then restore your coins.  If you try to restore your coin with the old software rev.  it will not allow you...once again you must have your 24 words seeds - it is your best friend.  If you don't have it, you are screwed.

You focus on the wrong thing - just a waste of energy:
Assuming that in three years a bitcoin worth $500,000.  Does it make a difference if you paid $5,500 during last week dip or $6,600 before the dip ?  Now you are watching/ waiting to pay $7,000 ??  
Why would you want to sell at $7000 ?  Why is the FUD ?  Just leave your coin alone please !

2). If history repeat, and you buy one btc now at ~$8000 - in November of 2021 the same BTC will worth $484,000.  Any question ??

What if bitcoin never dip down below $2500 again ?  you'd never earned $1000,000 - 
What if bitcoin never dip down below $5000 again ?  You'd never earned $500,000 -
The odd that bitcoin dip below $2,500 and $5,000 is increasing become very difficult- you are betting against a high odd, or wishful thinking.
I for once would like to by bitcoin at $1000 - this was the price only a year ago...do you think this is realistic ? 
A couple thousand dollars in a grand scheme of a million dollars is nothing- you've got to look at the big picture.

Regarding within BTC eco system, inflation is not necessarily a bad thing - in fact it is a very good thing for the btc investors...more people want to own a piece of btc, they just have to divide the btc into smaller fractions - which is perfectly fine !! A btc could be equal to 1 cent of usd or one billion of usd  - it doesn't matter, it's a "relative" measurement method base strictly on the supply and demand of the btc.  And we all know that the supply of the btc is limited to $21 million coins - so there you go...

Better ! - thanks for the clarification.  I agree that it won't be linear.  I'm not sure that as the bidding price rises some people won't budge and sell their coin.  It may take some convincing offering, but for the right price someone will sell - especially, with a large amount of cash pumping in this market.  I for once, would not sell my coins as I'm in it for the long haul - I also notice that the general consensus (from the comments on this forum and others) that most btc owners will not sell their coins anytime soon.  On the other hand, we are now talking about human psychology and emotions, which are often complicated and unpredictable...
