Coinbase has higher fees and a lesser platform of coin. Use Gemini or UDAX

Cash app, it’s very easy to use, it can deposit money instantly and the CEO of the app, is a huge advocate of bitcoin himself.

Wait until you start making real capital then you'll see what real moves are

NEVER have your private key, stamped, engraved or anything. Keep it locked on your I notes or write it down and hide it only somewhere you know 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:10:07
Shit thanks !

I like to think of the IRS as Arthur Morgan from red dead redemption, he’s very good at collecting debts.

That BCH rise happens everytime it’s the fork 
@_date: 2018-11-04 09:53:17
Looks like we’re going to take a dump. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:14:00
It happens literally every time the price drop on bitcoin is inevitable 
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:27:17
Really good points I believe. Bitcoin has an elaborate base as compared to mortgage rates, an 80% drop can mean a huge return.

So if you wanna ask yourself again, yes you should buy. $7k come on now guys

Is it a proper time to sell btc
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:19:16
Don’t you agree that I should sell whatever shares I have right now then re invest it right back in before it possibly jumps back to 20k !!
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:52:50
Fuckkkk I wanna re invest my shares though shouldn’t I do it sooner than later ? Before the price keeps going up
