Hi there,
Thank you for reaching out. Due to problems with our ACH processor, we experienced a temporary lapse in our Instant ACH functionality. As of this morning, that functionality has now been resolved. In lieu of pre-crediting your deposit, we will expedite the timeline to clear your transfer. Please let us know if you have further questions.
Onward &amp; Upward,
