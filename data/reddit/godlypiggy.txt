@_date: 2018-01-05 15:03:46

@_date: 2018-01-05 17:57:38
daddy's back!
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:05:40
genius haha
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:50:14
coinbase is a wallet not trading platform. you can use Gdax (same company with coinbase) Once your gdax is set up, you can transfer your coins from Coinbase to Gdax for free instantly, then you can start trading. But on gdax, they only have fiat/btc, fiat/ltc, fiat/eth. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:12:37
haha very cute
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:01:44
ok, dear coinbase exec, what your customers want is to add segwit and do NOT add ripple
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:32:26
Any news? Why price is down? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:38:54
Not sure how long this pump will last. But I’m happy to see it on Friday! It’s going to be a wonderful weekend. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:32:50
Bitcoin isn’t volatile. Humans are. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:04:08
30th is coming.. fingers crossed.
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:25:54
What did you tell?
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:34:11
looks like something big is coming. up or down?
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:27:45
I thought we were decentralized... 
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:58:40
Isn’t the bear period long enough?  I’m getting annoyed.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:51:58
Wow you made a smart decision to sell in Dec.
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:01:12
Im with you
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:43:58
haha id like to know too. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:06:33
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:47:57
good things come when you least expect them. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:03:30
Ah good to know.
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:45:54
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:30:19
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:33:48
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:19:34
Thank you! This is so cool!
@_date: 2018-08-01 10:18:10
happy bday!
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:06:49
Yes! 
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:13:32
Not only my head... my entire body hurts.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:01:57
there's a crystal strong support 5.8-6k we've been built up in the past few months. we won't go lower. shake out weak hands and fake believers.
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:47:32
for me, neither of them is hot. but i respect your taste.
@_date: 2018-08-02 10:35:34
It’s my cake day! BTC go go go 
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:34:48
no. fake out, shake out, then shoot up.
@_date: 2018-08-05 16:15:45
you guys should watch this video [ he got a point. still bullish!
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:02:23
who can tell me whats going on?
@_date: 2018-08-28 18:30:30
This is like dystocia... come on bitcoin, let’s hit 8k
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:49:19
on a positive note: there is no boring days in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:37:29
that sounds right to me.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:54:40
no way 3k.  this is a rhyme.
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:22:18
wow you bought the real dip!
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:28:48
most people are unaware of the fact that their money devalue over time and how governments control exchange rate, supply of money and etc. on the opposite, they regard bitcoin as scam. Financial education is important in today's world.
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:45:33
This long bear year has taught us that bitcoin is the safest coin in crypto space. Every investor should own a fraction.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:48:10
6k is made of diamond. hard to break. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:58:43
if i can handle btc, i can handle any difficulties in life. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:03:54
haha love the humor
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:00:13
We will make it! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:39:11
it makes sense!
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:31:30
its funny that you think she is hot. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:07:34
we are doing well. alts got smashed.
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:11:14
some ignorants constantly say bitcoin is over, whenever the price goes down. they never learn.
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:12:02
shake hands. let shitcoins die then we will rise up high.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:10:54
i don't get it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 09:03:20
1st! Off to a good day. Show some green BTC!
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:44:26
ive seen a new pattern, unlike in the past, falls on the weekend, now the price rises on the weekend.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:16:44
Hey, I live in Paris. What’s the address? I want to see myself.
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:07:16
Good call
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:43:39
Did you get a new ID? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:05:06
popping pimples.. lmao. your analogy is fantastic.
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:41:05
it sounds like sec was not even prudential when taking this decision. Only 2 days later, they decide to review the case...
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:29:50
Wow, reverse psychology! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:46:57
i like ur rap
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:38:15
If something is destined to succeed, it will succeed regardless. With or without ETF, btc will be the only world currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:07:05
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:36:45
yea i was making a transaction yesterday too. it was slow. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:11:17
C’mon 6.6k
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:31:35
capitulation period is still way better than natural disaster or terror attack. not a big deal. we survive just fine.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:53:16
Last time to buy under 7k... true story��
@_date: 2018-08-28 18:54:14
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:29:55
Ive decided to be offline. Once btc comes back to 7.5k and above, please msg me! 
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:36:17
I’m not sure abt hodling alts but hodling btc is always a good decision (unless you bought on the top) 
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:36:22
I'm positive regardless.
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:01:32
we are numb to denial already..
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:17:08
At least this is more entertaining than this boring market  
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:52:56
any btc hodlers here? i hodl regardless 
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:27:13
BUY THE DIP. We thought every dip was the last dip.
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:25:38
That’s basically me.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:15:09
i don't want to see 5k...
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:03:09
this is very cute. you should develop a series.
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:46:22
This market is unpredictable. It is possible on each side- stay in bear or begin a bull run.  It's ignorant to deny each possibility. When you said the truth is plain, you consider yourself to know the truth yet others cannot see? Ignorance, that is. 
You said some dudes post emotional words. I can read your emotion behind your sentences too. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:08:54
I agree. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:35:09
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:51:28
If u are unhappy with anything in your life, I forgive your rudeness. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:00:17
holy, that was a quick move.
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:07:17
the hamster post got 5.1k upvotes. wow post of the year (so far)
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:32:27
yes here
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:23:04
You clearly are blessed! Good luck to we all. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:01:43
i went to this youtube channel and watched another 2 videos. very interesting! keep doing the good work.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:37:01
Im always ready for bull. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 23:23:57
haha i was wondering the same. maybe mods think its a cute post
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:26:52
diverse opinions are always welcomed. My principle is if the person has evil/selfish motives behind his words and actions. I am not a hater of Warren Buffet, despite his opinion about BTC. But personally I dislike WS, Jihan and Ver. We wouldn't have had a free fall from 6k to 3k if they didn't have to cash out BTC for that stupid "ego" war. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 08:42:31
Good morning from Europe.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:37:28
This weeekend maybe 
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:15:03
i cannot believe i actually clicked on the link
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:21:56
i wouldn't mind if it happened as early as tomorrow  
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:35:02
It’s gonna be a good weekend. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:28:36
Spot on
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:14:20
how long further will the sideways go?
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:40:44
and we are asking 5k not 10 or 20.  this is such a humble request hehe
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:42:36
I like the way you think!
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:33:26
folks, its been almost a year... will btc make a miracle in the next 2 months
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:20:19
Hopefully...I’m getting impatient. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:36:05
i hope you are right cuz im hodling the bag since long long time ago.
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:07:56
Lmao send me out to an isolated island. Btc would moon! 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:58:14
Lmao. You made my day.
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:42:52
I’m a bag holder. I honestly don’t like him but he won the bet since btc broke 6k last night. I’m not sure TA really works or hes just lucky. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:56:19
imho shitcoins are issues right now. the sooner the market can shake them out, the sooner we are back to super bull run.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:34:55
this is sad...why doesnt he try to live a peaceful life...
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:24:02
i know... i dont understand either
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:17:43
its quite painful to hodl right now. but i dont want to sell low either...
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:42:15
ive realized btc usually turns green when im out eating drinking or traveling... 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:00:38
 6k is pretty hard to break. at least i hope so...
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:23:43
Yea still hodling. It’s just depressing. Hope God take me through this capitulation period soon.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:58:16
from Tone Vay.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:17:46
i still think btc futures brought btc down.
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:35:58
yea, they are not easily swayed by and emotions and market sentiment.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:42:32
dont sell on coinbase. sell on coinbase pro (used to be gdax).
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:29:33
Just because TA says 5k, now everyone expects 5k. Most people don’t have their own opinion. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:37:14
Haha thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:23:16
where there is a will, there is a way. guys, lets altogether support 6k financially ( or spiritually)
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:11:46
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:53:03
yes. i believed so too. when people thought bitcoin future would bring btc to antoher level, I was skeptical.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:29:09
in order to save the market, we need satoshi to make an appearance 
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:27:38
germany is out and bitcoin is down. what a day. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:21:14
God sent a miracle to bear market 
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:37:50
history repeats, patterns repeat BUT those are just for reference. Future is unpredictable.
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:49:15
touch screen. nice!
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:22:43
buy orders have been triggered. wont stay here for long. up we go agains soon.
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:11:22
those guys never care about crypto and blockchain. they only want to use bots to get our money. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:58:29
He is a true fraud
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:45:32
Adoption takes time. Now, we're seeing more and more coming our way.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:27:58
my alarm just went off. what a surprise while i was doing laundry.
@_date: 2019-02-13 09:54:04
Oh that is smooth 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:37:16
You never know. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:22:46
you are dang right! lambo is way better than wings.
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:08:30
In fact, he just saw a bull with wings flying towards him. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:23:20
nothing is more fun than bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:00:02
regardless the price, we are making progress steadily and gradually.
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:32:30
2019 just began...
@_date: 2019-02-05 20:46:29
im hungry now 
@_date: 2019-02-06 09:59:03
or look for comfort and empathy.
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:41:09
you made my day haha.
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:28:10
At least he’s a doer. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:54:51
yes! progressing!
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:17:00
u mean a bull driving a lambo LMAO
@_date: 2019-02-09 08:16:35
Haha love it
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:04:34
I bet!
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:06:52
time to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:17
hold on tight to it this time.
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:50:39
science guy
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:11:46
You still bought at a good price
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:38:13
Hopefully 6k this weekend 
@_date: 2019-04-12 06:56:43
We will go back up. Maybe not today but soon
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:07:16
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:02:41
Yep... who cares... China bans google and IG too, but they have been doing quite well
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:39:02
here u go. just upvoted
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:11:49
Cool art
@_date: 2019-04-13 09:55:58
Sideways then shoot up
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:59:18
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:37:23
The new episode of "bitcoin and friends" just came out. he is moving to LA. :)
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:17:32
just wait. there will be big moves
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:27:10
 Are you ready boys?
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:28:06
my blockfolio couldn't get refreshed for 2 mins, so i checked coinbase instead. dang, i love it!
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:06:12
Yep I’m with you
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:15:43
fast down fast up
@_date: 2019-04-18 17:15:34
Mine too
@_date: 2019-04-01 05:10:25
Yep. Timing is critical. 
@_date: 2019-04-13 13:12:36
At this point, I don’t care if he is or isn’t the person he claims to be. All I know Bitcoin is awesome yet he isn’t.
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:42:33
there is no such thing. always zigzag. buy the dip.
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:41:20
Sell 0.3 maybe... to buy Xmas presents. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 12:39:59
Doing well
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:04:06
 I just woke up! 14% up! 
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:13:04
can you please draw next 10 years for us? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:29:47
So u think we will break out soon?
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:38:43
I’ll be so content if one btc is worth 20k by eoy
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:51:30
sounds like a voodoo technique haha
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:27:27
nobody knows... so unpredictable
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:51:02
agreed. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:41:57
buy bit by bit from now throughout feb.  i have gut feeling that the end of feb would be the end of bear market.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:35:46
smart haha
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:44:26
 Those “experts”always sounded so certain 
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:42:11
don't underestimate the power of WOM. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:27:58
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:59:46
growing steadily
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:04:10
I had to google who she is. She is cool indeed. "Regulation should be focused on good disclosure, education, warding off fraud, and making sure it is not used for illicit activities. " This is spot on.
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:04:22
let's do it!
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:13:01
I will never ever watch The Simpsons again.
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:58:17
that is so cool
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:43:53
he was in macao. he probably cashed out bitcoin in order to play in casino.
@_date: 2019-01-12 10:08:22
he probably will come back sometime this year or next...
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:17:57
BUT that is a 4-digit coin. Movie ticket only costs 10 bucks... 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:44:43
Thats why Switzerland is a rich country. Swiss are openminded.
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:40:38
very frustrating
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:52:45
good news. karma comes around goes around. we will see bull run soon after they are dead.
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:19:53
another leg down
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:38:12
I laughed out so hard. This is exactly a different (positive) perspective to accept 7k. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:39:56
love the color contrast. very nice.
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:41:39
Very cute. That cake smells of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:02:02
important news! its going to be a bright year for btc. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:44:30
cheers to 2019
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:39:44
haha 
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:51:14
cool beans. I always do the opposite of the sentiment tendency. Based on your index chart, I assume we will be back to the bull in 2 weeks.hopefully.
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:15:59
we get screwed over and over again. im going to send my cv to mcdonald
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:48:31
yes here
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:26:32
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:14:56
anybody hates sideways? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:32:16
I hodl. 1st, it's almost impossible to time the market. 2nd, if the average buy is very low, no point to panic sell... 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:42:12
How do you know?
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:15:20
Well, USD is used for buying/selling porn, human, drugs and a lot more.  What do you say?

Are we going back to 11k? Its been a cold winter here. Come on BTC, I need some heat.
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:08:36
I've been with BTC for 4 years and I'm still in love with it.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:02:23
many things could be risky if you don't study on it and know it well.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:35:52
Very true. I’ll be content too if we hold it tight above 10k. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:23:36
thought BTC at least made it to top3.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:07:10
In 6 months, 60k 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:26:45
i love btc, but ether is not a scam. some altcoins might be.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:42:26
After how many crashes, can people finally be immune to btc crash? Is the crash really THAT scary? If it really is scary, why the weak-hands always come back to buy again? I dont understand the psychology behind it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:32:36
i think so. i hope people watch out. the bear is not over yet
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:28:53
im with you.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:49:10
cute. you should've made a boomerang haha. chances are btc will come back and forth between earth and moon often:)
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:28:28
 hodl! dont repeat the same mistake. you will be fine.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:42:08
so true
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:53:07


mmm where do you see it has no sign of going up... are u relatively new to btc?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:26:22
people always regret not to hodl back then. but when they are given a 2nd, 3rd, 4th chance, they repeat the same mistake over and over.  
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:13:09
pure market manipulation. the timing of news release is bizarre.
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:53:36
exactly! buy 0.001 or whatever and hodl.  
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:15:10
c'est juste a little pull-back. the chart is still looking good.
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:02:04
u also can try bittrex or kraken. personally i prefer coinbase. but buy on coinbase pro ( was gdax), set a limit buy order, so you can avoid some fees.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:09:02
i thought u invested 50k. i cannot judge. money is money. regardless 50 or 50k. but dont worry. btc will make a comeback.
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:34:34
CNBC is so stupid. I think certain whales bribe financial media to spread FUD.
@_date: 2018-07-17 09:56:44
Coinbase has finally received the green light from regulators, in the form of approval from the U.S. SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:04:36
when the moon was too obvious to EVERYONE in Dec 2017, the disaster was actually coming. We will only get better from here.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:17:56
i just love how resilient btc is. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:21:27
I wonder what she replied.
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:18:35
the financial media always seek a cause for seeking it.  
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:50:42
isnt it fun!
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:29:52
I totally agree.
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:33:06
ignorant.   
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:25:40
Yea, just go to  They have full guidance. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:16:53
the price makes me very happy today. happy 4th of july!
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:44:02
i agree. 6.8k is a major resistance. if we break it and consolidate above it for a little while, the bull run will officially start.
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:53:03
yes... anything can happen. ive become very humble since i got in crypto cuz ive realized i dont understand this market
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:06:01
true that
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:45:23
this made my day!
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:49:46
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:40:58
what did i miss? any news? i was just in bathroom for a min then my alert on blockfolio went off..
@_date: 2018-07-29 17:43:02
sideways is boring, BUT way better than plunge.
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:45:27
btc is the boss!
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:51:26
im bullish regardless
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:43:11
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:48:13
dont invest in crypto with credit card. crypto is very volatile. invest in what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:30:24
It’s going to be a good weekend! 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:23:54
Yeeeep I hv high expectation for tomorrow... 
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:12:50
Robert Kiyosaki talks about crypto at [17:27﻿]( He hates printed money.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:29:37
It was manipulation yesterday. Now we are back! 
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:23:20

@_date: 2018-07-24 12:51:35

@_date: 2018-07-15 22:08:24
FRANCE WON BTC UP!
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:45:30
u don't seem to know btc well 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:57:25
[**Joseph Young**‏ 
Selling bitcoin because you expected Cboe ETF to be approved but Winklevoss ETF got rejected is like selling Twitter shares because Facebook plunged 22%.   Those two are not the same!
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:44:34
for me, its bullish.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:04:12
I agree.
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:29:55
i though twinklevoss etf got rejected a year ago. is this old news???
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:11:27
as ppl always say, this is the last chance to buy low. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:42:28
GET USED TO IT.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:51:16
I feel so sorry for that guy.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:17:23
Waking up to 7.5k:) Guys, let’s be humble and prudent.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:39:26
global celebration!
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:01:04
Thought he lost 120k. 21k is not that bad. But any loss is sad.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:17:48
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:46:24
Lol this is hilarious. Made my day
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:17:42
I feel really really sorry for him...
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:22:36
This meme is spot on!
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:30:08
so much is how much?
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:13:34
My lifelong opinion is there is only one bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:56:41
Guys admit that. The rise of bitcoin cures everything.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:49:54
^ of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:43:39
It goes too fast to a point my blockfolio stops refreshing.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:03:19
What? I said there’s only one bitcoin not only one cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:06:26
I think so
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:34:08
Another crash... the entire year sucks 
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:40:34
 What’s go?? Pumping?
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:42:29
Always believe in the goodness of people and goodness of Bitcoin! This is inspiring. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:06:12

@_date: 2018-12-27 21:20:57

@_date: 2018-12-05 17:02:21
every day is like a tick bomb haha.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:23:03
This made my day. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:17:58
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:57:42
Yes. Things we learned in bear market have to be applied in bull market. Be humble and prudent.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:55:40
Don’t make me sadder please haha
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:39:41
