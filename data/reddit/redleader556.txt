wait a min
let me see if i have this right
u plan to implement transaction blacklisting as the default on gentoo *again*?
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:34:24
then why not make a separate bitcoind package with your blacklisting. call it bitcoin-for-luke-jr
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:01:45
this is too much. tone it the fuck down

do you realize that even in socialist systems there are still 1%ers and 99%ers. typically it's the guys shilling for socialism that end up as the 1%.
"Let us rejoice with our new nation. From now on we shall all pursue our own utopias in peace and fairness" - sent from the yacht I bought with your fucking taxes
and please, in america at least we have socialism for the wealthy, capitalism for the poor. it's called a dysfunctional society and your socialist bullshit does nothing to alter the reality of corrupt people controlling masses of fools who are incapable of critical thinking

it's the same as last time
and most people just go with the default settings
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:12:48
how about the freedom to **do what you want with your money**? isn't that what bitcoin is supposed to be about?
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:23:56
this isn't about gentoo
this is about someone using his position of power to force transaction blacklisting on people. idgaf if it's easy to disable. the point is **why would you even do this?!** WTF

how in the hell is transaction blacklisting going to make for a "better bitcoin". is this real life
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:41:40


everyone because it's a slippery slope. blacklisting threatens user freedoms. it should be resisted profusely and repeatedly
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:54:59
you mean this?


what's the deal here? are you going back on your word
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:42:57
never invested but never saw it as a scam either. this one seems over the top
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:59:49


oh, so they're getting transaction blacklisting by default? why would blacklisting transactions be good for bitcoin adoption
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:11:35
eternal vigilance, but tbh calling out oppressors typically makes them cling more to secrecy. the elite always operate in the shadows
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:32:57
blacklisting isn't going to sit better with me with this he said she said stuff. make your case or change your ways. this is the second time the bitcoin community has spoken out against your blacklisting
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:33:46
You mean like, why would blacklisting transactions be good for bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:16:49
second time i ask this: why would blacklisting transactions be good for bitcoin adoption
