The troll box works both ways.

Pfft.. You're just misdirecting us away from your true alt-crush: Hobo Nickels.

The picture says a lot about how Karpeles thinks. He's *assuming* his walk will be short, highlighting his lack of preparedness for unforeseen circumstances - not unlike the situation that affects his exchange.

I'm pulling 0.02-0.03 BTC a day with 3 R9 290s set on middlecoin.

How verbose.

Many people would disagree with me, but I believe we should invoke the democracy that exists within the process of mining to Blacklist any coins which fall into the hands of entities who wish to subvert Bitcoin.  
It is entirely possible to burn the bridges to the coins confiscated at the Silk Road - the same can be done to Mt Gox's coins.

[This]( should put your mind at ease.

I tried... DDOSed to hell and back.

Most people are not idealists. There should be an incentive to running nodes, other than just "doing the right thing". 
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:07:45
Both sides are being dishonest. There needs to be a real debate, where people can listen to the pros/cons in real-time, instead of this behind closed doors bullshit.

It's not difficult for a centralized power to hide in a decentralized system, by pretending to be individual users. BIP101 is nothing compared to the grand design.

Then, we will cry in the shade.

The same agencies also use hardware-level backdoors, so it doesn't matter either way. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:31:29
Yeah, but at least his conscience is clean.

For speculative investors, sure, but changing the reward system does not alter the payment function, plus the name will always have novelty value, because it was the first viable crypto-currency with an infamous beginning. 
No one really knows how this will turn out, but I hope to see all of you driving lambos.

How about you take a community vote on the matter, instead of forcing your will upon us?
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:02:44
This would be nice in Conky.

Bitcoin's value is going to go up IMO, unless someone finds a way to destroy the internet. 
but... 
What about Net Neutrality? Could not the government just throw more support behind an alternate Crypto, while slowing down the Bitcoin network?
