Sorry, USA is not supported yet.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:25:58
yes we are fully reserved, we buy bitcoins from you and allow you to deposit money to the card.
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:15:31
We are using this brand for nearly 3 years, so it is too late.
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:39:31
I agree, but when the company was founded, there were less than 10 altcoins. And Spectro is how we call our products: SpectroCard.com, SpectroCoin.com etc so it was just an coincidence that altcoins started to "boom".
@_date: 2015-10-19 14:37:54
Yes it works everywhere where Visa or MasterCard is accepted. No bank account required for debit card if you fund it with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-26 23:51:45
You should also try  they support GBP and are London based
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:43:41
Transactions were authorized before card being blocked. You should contact us through helpdesk.
@_date: 2016-05-26 23:52:21
SpectroCoin.com does accept Visa card
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:48:37
Yes you will be able to get money back to SpectroCoin account or transfer it to another card, that is not an issue.
@_date: 2016-05-25 20:14:21










You have asked to block a card only after payment was authorised. Now the card is successfully blocked. You should contact merchants at which your card has been used. And also always be cautious where are you using your card, so nobody gets your credentials and uses them illegally. Also it is smart, to have several cards for unsecure websites or to load the card only before payment, so nobody will be able to use your card without funding it from SpectroCoin account initially.
