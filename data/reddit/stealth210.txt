Or a bitcoin ETF would be cool.

Probably an FHA loan. Only 3% required down. I did this when I bought my first.

50TB is a lot to transfer if people still only have 100Mbps connections(top end for most of US consumer market at the moment). We're going to need to be talking gigabit(s) mainstream in 2024.
He talks about bandwidth needed to stay on top of it, but what if you need to rebuild from zero. At 100Mbps, that's 46 days. 4.6 days at 1Gbps. Half a day (12 hours) at 10Gbps. That's a lot of data no matter how you slice it.

Did you really mean 1GB/sec? 8Gbps in 2024? I sure hope so, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
I had a 10Mbps cable connection in 1998. Sixteen years later and I'm only up to 105Mbps. In 10 more years, my realistic expectation is to have 1Gbps to the house. So, given 50TB, that's about 4 and a half days to get the blockchain. That's a long time.

Using LTE for your home connection is not viable, let alone exceeding 300GB over the air like that. It's just not going to happen, they will throttle even an "unlimited" package well below 50GB or even 25GB. That's a shit ton of data in mobile cell network terms. Mobile networks are not meant for that shear amount of data, that's what wired networks are supposed to take care of and they can, they are being artificially held back by the likes of Comcast, et al.

Lucky you, Comcast in Memphis and I have a 300GB cap. I consistently go over and get extra charges. No other ISP options other than move to another city.

It may not mean much to you, but it's a cold hard reality for us who have Comcast as our only option. 300GB/month. It's sad and it's real. It sucks.

That is part of his business and he's always been bullish on gold/PM, but his main business is international investing (or just non-USD investments). For example, he has a number of mutual funds:
...and only two out of eight on that list are linked in any way to PMs (EPHAX and EPGFX).
