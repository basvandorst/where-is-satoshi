I'd highly recommend the SENS Research Foundation. "SENS Research Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity that is transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease."

Info below copied from previous thread:
I'd like to propose donating towards research in regenerative medicine. The SENS foundation provides a compelling vision on the different possibilities to cure many illnesses related to aging.
Against heavy odds, founder Aubrey de Grey has pushed his ideas and foundation to a high level of acceptance, gaining some small victories in the struggle.
What seems to be little known, and I'm happy to redact this for privacy reasons, is that Aubrey himself had donated millions to this cause, putting his money where his mouth is. His actions and intentions have been consistently genuine.
Admittedly, many of the research ideas being funded by the foundation are not quite mainstream. It is still important that the foundation supported the more overlooked areas of medical research. Where the are lots of mainstream funding, potential ROI is often lower.

Also, you could occasionally look for individual projects (drop in on  to crowdfund with smaller amounts.
