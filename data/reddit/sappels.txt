Yeah right.... He'll be the one to govern it if that is what he's planning. You might not believe me now but wait until someone is executed for saying bcash.

This is good for Bitcoin.

I know that you have to sell them first, but let me rephrase my question: Is there a bitcoin wallet that i can use that lets me sell them like any fucking where and THEN transfer that to PayPal.  
  
(Sorry if i seem salty, I haven't slept well lately and your comment didn't really answer my question)

No matter how i try to answer this i feel like a toddler learning how walk for the first time. This is the answer i came up with:. 
  
It doesn't have to be super fast, as long as i can get it to PayPal.  
  
For the record i won't be mining, investing or anything like that. I just stumbled upon this free btc lottery like a week ago. Thought it was fake but tried anyway for fun.   
  
Turned out to be legit and i managed to get 0.00034 BTC transferred to a spectrocoin wallet i got (which i don't want to keep using after all the shit i've read after googling them).  
  
As i said, No big amounts but i'm not saying no to a free dollar every now and then. I kinda feel ashamed now. No idea why. Sorry if i'm not serious enough about this :(

I'll give coinbase a try, Thanks. Yeah i know you have to sell it first but i have yet to see any wallet that lets me transfer the €/$/£ i've recieved from selling to PayPal.
