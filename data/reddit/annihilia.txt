Absolutely, and I would argue that this is the point of Bitcoin. 
If it was simply supposed to be a "fast, cheap, reliable" payment network, Satoshi would've founded a fintec startup and not have all of the pseudonymity or cypherpunk stuff associated with it.

Opendime's been around for a while, but it's such a cool and unique device that doesn't get talked about nearly enough, so I figured I'd make a video about it. They're super affordable, so I'd recommend picking one up if a Trezor or similar device is out of reach.

Mine hasn't arrived yet, but I'm going to do a video on it for sure.
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:28:24
Opendime is more of a bearer instrument than a traditional hardware wallet. They're not meant to spend off of (in fact, you need to permanently destroy a part of the device to access the private key.)
There are multiple methods to verify that the keys on the device belong to the address, as mentioned in the video.

@_date: 2015-06-18 13:20:15


That's a "move to Somalia" caricature of marketing.
Marketing is fundamentally about persuasion. Who is your audience? I'm willing to bet it's not savvy Greek millennials with zero savings. The ones who have the most to worry about are older people who have sacked away cash over the years. These people don't want to be rebels. They don't want to be revolutionaries. They just want to know that their families will be safe from financial ruin.
As much as it will make hardcore bitcoiners wince, the best inspiration for marketing to the mainstream will come from centralized services like Circle and BitPay. No molotov cocktails, no Guy Fawkes masks. The key is to normalize the technology as much as possible by making it seem relatable and familiar.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:53:53
I have a position in Bitcoin but I'll admit that you're right. It's like when you buy a new car and suddenly everyone around you owns the same make and model.

Totally agree with what you're saying, but let me clarify this point:




The operating word is "should", here. Some people think that everyone *should* do things lone-wolf free-for-all style.

Yes, and therein lies the problem with these projects - a lot of people don't seem to understand that marketing is half of the equation. 
Look, I am as anti-state as they get, but I also realize that calling your amazing technology for human liberation **DARK MARKET** and going off and revealing all of your cards in the most incendiary language you can come up with, well.. that's the kind of self-sabotage that has been the fall of revolutionaries since the beginning of time. 
If I was a talented enough programmer to develop something like this, my branding aesthetics would be dominated by stark white with strategic pastel accents, Helvetica Neue Lt copy with a heavy emphasis on full bleed photography of smiling families or couples eating ice cream. For the product name, I'd pull out a copy of my Hipster Thesaurus, open up to "Freedom", throw some darts at it, and combine all of the hits into a single word.
If I wanted to scare the ever-living shit out of people and alienate all but those occupying the echo chambers I inhabit, I would call it **DARK MARKET** and tell people who would otherwise be curious about a people-powered marketplace^(^made ^that ^up ^right ^here, ^how ^'bout ^that) that "the government can't stop the signal!!"
You don't reveal your cards from the start. You speak the language of the masses and you change the situation from within.

There are a lot more people now than there were at $10. I'd argue that the percentage of price-cheerleaders vs doers has remained the same, but the increased body count has been a boon for infrastructure / innovation since we hit those record highs.

Very gross.

I don't know.. A lot of it lines up, but there are some big holes in the story. A few people have dug up Dorian Nakamoto's model train forum posts and Amazon reviews and the writing styles don't line up at all.

AnCap/voluntaryist here. I agree. I think these links should live in an FAQ under "further research". Yes, the philosophical foundations are distinctly libertarian anarchist, but this sub is about the technology and its broader appeal. 
Yes, fellow ancaps, it feels great to be able to point to the sidebar of a major sub and say "shove it, statist", but let's be objective here and recognize that the sidebar shouldn't be a treatise with citations. We're not ceding anything by removing those links, if that's what you're worried about; we have enough loudmouths here (including myself) that the anti-state tone is pretty much default for this place.

I don't like to self-identify as anything, but my views most closely align with anarcho-capitalism. Nobody I know who shares my views believes that the free market will bring about a glorious pain-free utopia. When people say "the market will come up with a solution", they're essentially saying that over time, people will work to figure it out if they are free to do so. That's it.

There are a whole lot of people who still think mining is something they can just get right into. It wouldn't surprise me if Newegg's marketing department heard about Bitcoin mining from customers way back when GPU mining was popular, but only chose to capitalize on it now without understanding that they are no longer profitable. I am a marketer by profession and I know that a lot of places have a disconnect between the tech side of things and marketing. More often than not, they don't operate cohesively.
What good does it do to come out advertising GPUs for Bitcoin mining today? Not only do you show your ass to the world by coming off as ill-informed, but there's the potential to piss off a lot of customers just getting into Bitcoin by driving them to buy expensive hardware that's not going to do anything for them.

Totally. My business specializes in marketing for tech startups so I'm intimately familiar with the problem.

@_date: 2014-03-22 19:26:19
Oh man, this is something I've been bringing up for quite some time now and I encounter a lot of resistance from many in the community for a bunch of different reasons: 
* The whole point of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized. We don't need centralized marketing like some business.
* Bitcoin isn't a *brand*
* Bitcoin shouldn't give into marketing, which is basically lying.
* It's decentralized so everyone should do what they want with marketing.
Marketing, as a discipline, is more than just catchy slogans and cool logos. It really takes a lot of analysis and strategic intuition to be effective and I don't think many people appreciate that. It's not a science, but there are tried and true practices that are essentially axiomatic. 
Bitcoin's decentralized nature or the fact that it's a technology and not really a product in the traditional sense absolutely DOES NOT preclude it from being a brand or benefiting from a cohesive message. The beauty of having a decentralized community is that there CAN be a unified message, but it's one that is adopted voluntarily because market actors recognize the benefits of cooperation versus everyone running around saying different things.
One way this could work is similar to the Android Design Guidelines. These guidelines for developing Android UI / UX are not enforced, but they are highly encouraged so users can navigate different Android apps and understand that the hamburger button activates the sliding menu or what they can hope to find in a three dot overflow menu. 
With Bitcoin, a collaborative marketing wiki (or something) can outline Bitcoin marketing best practices so that the language and visuals used throughout the ecosystem can appear to have consistency. As a Bitcoin business, I would be able to look through these best practice guidelines and know, for instance, to use millibit denominations or refer to bitcoin as a digital currency instead of a virtual currency. Of course you don't have to follow any guidelines, but consistency in language between different Bitcoin sites would really help new users and help the media get their facts straight.

Maybe it's the bitterness of missing the boat with Bitcoin years ago, so they're trying to shill others into new projects in an effort to pump them up and make similar gains. Whether or not crypto succeeds or fails in the long-term doesn't really factor into things when you're all about getting rich quick.

Yes, people are unnecessarily freaking out and it's mostly due to being glued to charts. The price does not indicate the health of the ecosystem, as evidenced by people actively contributing to development, adoption, building community, etc. The real metric is the number of crypto jobs, large scale projects, and resources being diverted from other areas of the economy into this space.
Day trading crypto is a fool's errand. You *can* make a ton of money, but most people will get rekt. The market is thin and whales are having their time taking advantage of it for the time being. I feel strongly that this won't be the case forever.

Part of what you get with Casa is their 2 of 3 multisig service + a Trezor One, a consumer-friendly dashboard, and premium support.

While the probability that Trezor or Ledger will act maliciously are low in 2019, verifying your own transactions may not seem like it matters.. until it does.
Granted, it's still very difficult and cumbersome for most people, but the ideal situation is to make the user experience of running a full node so stupid simple and automatic that people are validating transactions without even knowing it.

Counterpoint: It is up to Bitcoin users to demand certain reassurances from these service providers. When more legit online wallets start cropping up due to demand, these fly by night ops will quickly vanish. 
What constitutes a legit online wallet business? Well, for starters, one that actually has a physical office that is not some dude's basement. Yeah, I get that startups need to bootstrap, but when you're holding onto peoples' money and acting as a motherfucking BANK, the bar needs to be raised.

If Bitcoin is to ever achieve wider adoption, it needs to be as easy or easier than whatever people are using now. Reliable, trustworthy intermediary services are NECESSARY for this.

While it may seem like that, you need to zoom out a bit to get a better picture of what the lack of IP enforcement in China is actually doing. 
The differences between these "copycat" products may seem minimal, but that's because the changes are extremely incremental. The pace of change happens quickly across a ton of different companies, so 99% may be uninspired garbage, but in trying to out-do one another in the smallest ways, you end up with something incredible like the bezel-less Mi Mix or the Vivo under-screen fingerprint sensor. And that 99% isn't a waste either; there's a lot you don't see, like finding ways to streamline manufacturing.
In the global markets, the generation times are typically one year or more, so all of this R&amp;D culminates into a few products spread across a handful of large manufacturers.

It's more about using technology to circumvent current systems vs automating. For instance, Uber circumvents the taxi medallion and licensing scheme.
Intuitively I'd say local and state-level restrictions would be the easiest to get around, but then again, Bitcoin and Defense Distributed are going after money and guns, which are two big Federal-level issues. Maybe things that have a communications / information component will be the easiest. I imagine the most difficult would be infrastructure stuff.

This has nothing to do with price and everything to do with the fact that Bitcoin is the only crypto where the fundamentals (immutable, stateless, decentralized, censorship-resistant money) are actively defended. Everything else is compromised to one degree or another. In fact, any project with a visible founder, or god forbid, a CEO, is already DOA as these figures end up being big fat targets.
I entered this space for the same reason as you and around the same time, but the longer I've been here, the more I become convinced that these other projects are either outright scams, don't deliver any significant benefit over Bitcoin, or are well-meaning but missing a key component (usually an understanding of economics).

I get your sentiment, but I think there's a middle ground here. Memes have been a part of Bitcoin since the very beginning and they contribute to shaping the culture. 
However, there's been a less-than-ideal increase in the number of low effort memes and karma-harvesting reposts around here. I attribute it to the influx of new people who are excited about the "investment opportunity" versus the philosophy or tech, but we all start somewhere. Just downvote and discourage in the comments if you think something's not that great.

Def didn't take it personally. We all have our own unique experiences that shape the way we view things and advocate on behalf of Bitcoin.
My experiences inform my approach. Crypto is an interplay of technology, economics, and culture. Shitcoin projects leverage culture tremendously with influence and marketing. I think you're underestimating the significance of this with a "let the chips fall where they may" view. 
Community is important. Community defeated S2X and proved that it could fend off the most well-organized social attack on Bitcoin. A shared community culture significantly contributes to preventing hasty upgrades that could compromise the long-term survival of the whole project. 
This isn't a point of view based on a team mentality. It's conviction in the empirical conclusion that Bitcoin, by virtue of it being the oldest and most decentralized crypto (and with a pseudonymous &amp; absent inventor), has the greatest chance at delivering on the original promise of economic freedom from the state. To treat everything else as having an equal chance at this is to spread efforts too thin. This is serious stuff that I am passionate about; it's not a neat tech curiosity for me (and I don't think it is for you either).

And to add: Yes, this is a new technology, but it also shouldn't be compared to adoption cycles in common consumer tech. We're talking about an evolution in the technology of money, which doesn't happen very often. As you said, people need time to adjust to this from a behavioral / cultural perspective as well. Transaction finality, financial sovereignty, self-responsibility. These are just a few of the things people are not accustomed to in the 21st century.

3D printing has a long way to go before we're able to print lightbulbs. That requires molecular assembly, which is still decades out. These things will exist in a free market and should open up opportunities for exactly what you say, but independent of a resource-based economic model.
Even in a "post-scarcity" world, there will still be scarcity. An original painting is more coveted than a reproduction. Beachfront real estate will always be limited. Prices and voluntary exchange play a vital role to minimize conflicts over scarce resources (absent the corporatism / the state).
I see a RBE working amongst those who wish to live that kind of existence, but I've always thought that absent government, it would be nice to have a choice to voluntarily join one of these communities or live in some other society where private property is recognized.

Holy fuck, Japanese Curry jerky. I'm gonna buy some when I get back from my trip.
Also may I put a vote in for getting some bacon jerky in? I just tried some for the first time this week and it's almost totally indistinguishable from cooked bacon except it's 100x more convenient and obviously not as hot and crispy.

It took Bitcoin to get Fred Wilson to come out of hiatus. That says a lot.
For better or for worse, VCs are like lemmings, and I suspect this is going to push a lot of his peers to begin grabbing up Bitcoin startups.

Digital advertising is part of my consulting practice and the stats for YouTube Instream ads are pretty ridiculous. You can dial in the targeting like crazy too, so versus television ads, they are way more effective for the amount you spend. 
The only upside to a TV ad is the "legitimacy" you gain from it and the resulting press coverage "Bitcoin lunatics crowdfund TV ad".

Bitcoin: The Rise of the ePanhandler
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:54:22
That's cool, can't please everyone as design is subjective :) However, I would strongly advise we change out from default.
Whether we like it or not, Bitcoin is a brand. Someone in this thread asked whether we are more like or and I am going to make the likely offensive-sounding claim that we are more like the latter. Naruto, Pepsi, Spotify, Citibank, and Bitcoin are all brands that require marketing to stake a claim to mainstream relevancy. If the end goal is widespread adoption, we need to overcome the inertia of this endeavor being considered the exclusive realm of technologists, economists, day traders, and libertarians. I am taking the approach of how I market startups and applying it to Bitcoin. Part of that strategy is continuous reinforcement of the brand (a subreddit theme, in this case). 
The theme is not for you or I; it is for people from or who are curious about this whole Bitcoin thing. 
While the devs, cryptologists, futurists, and monetary theorists amongst us can continue to dig deeper, marketers, entrepreneurs, and creatives will work to expand outward. Together, Bitcoin can become an ocean, but one without the other will result in either a deep well or a shallow pond.

Although I can do CSS, it's not my bread 'n butter so I'm sure someone else can edit the style sheet much quicker than I could. I did the theme for and it took me a long ass time to figure out what did what. Also I never got around to figuring out how to do a proper night mode.

This is the same economic calculation problem that faces socialism. You cannot use the scientific method to accurately predict the subjective decisions made by individuals. What if I want a slightly shittier lightbulb because it Feng Shuis with my dining room set? What if I am a car enthusiast and I don't treat my vehicles like appliances? Can I live in my own private society where these things are possible and Zeitgeistians don't bother me?

I think we're on the same page as far as needing a paradigm shift in human consciousness / culture. However, I don't think everyone will necessarily buy into one worldview, which leaves room for lots of competing societies. That, to me, is an exciting prospect.

I understand the common Objectivist crits, but they are not internally consistent. 
There are no groups or collectives, only individuals. There is no such thing as a government, only individuals. Those who call themselves government do not possess a higher claim to any other person's life, yet most Objectivists claim that certain men should maintain a monopoly on the initiation of force for perceived utilitarian reasons, not because it is a philosophically sound concept. I feel that it is a reverse justification for the American state, which Rand idealized as a result of her upbringing.

If they think it's game over, then they didn't do enough research before taking a chance (which goes without saying is downright foolish). Yeah, a dip in the fiat exchange rate hurts from a psychological standpoint and will not do us any favors as far as PR, but many of us are here because we understand that Bitcoin has solved an enormous technical obstacle and the rest of the world will eventually figure it out once they stop fixating on the digital currency aspect of Bitcoin.
This will not be the last time governments will try to kill Bitcoin, and in the end, they will not end up succeeding because the protocol is simply too valuable an invention to be killed off like that.
