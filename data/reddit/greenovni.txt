We got wrecked :( 
I have electricity and internet, no water and it looks like its going to take months to fix the pipes. The kids are OK though, I've sent them to family up north while I rip the floor off my house to fix the water pipes. 
FEMA was a dick and claims the little house "settled" and that's what broke the pipes underneath since it is a manufactured home.... so no help for me. 
Once I started ripping the carpet out I found out that [our floors]( are some type of [compressed wood BS]( so they were right, the house did shift &amp; broke the pipes and crack the floor in a bunch of areas.
No problem since I'm quite resilient and as you can tell by the pics I'm patching the floor here and there as I go along.
But I'm ok bro :)

Nope, if you look at my post history, I was looking around where to buy bitcoin a few months back and decided on Gemini since everyone is giving their horror stories with coinbase.
Now that I re read my post I see what you mean
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:43
This is def quite confusing to the point I would wish more seasoned bitcoin traders / investors would actually mentor newbies and helped them navigate and shift through the overwhelming amount of information out there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:05:26
You are now Moderator of r/coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:46:20
It's funny because I actually had a good experience with them and I'm happy with that. If we look at r/bitcoin today everyone is screaming from the rooftops **fuck coinbase!!!** &amp; a few months back r/bitcoin was telling everyone new just like myself Coinbase Coinbase Coinbase

Why would Satoshi spending any of his bitcoins tank the market?
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:36:34
Easy, send them here 1JNsK75xRy9BRJYC2u1shGTRVfv3KXKANQ so I can finally go to flight school and fulfil a childhood dream.
In all seriousness, why would the person / persons controlling such a big amount of btc give it away? Specially to government entities?
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:28:25
Yeah, if he spends all of them at once.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:59:55
Tu eres Boricua?

Quick question, in your website you say (about KYC) the following 






    Burma
    Cuba
    Iran
    North Korea
    Sudan
    Syria
    United States
Does that mean that if I move to Puerto Rico, I could trade with my Spanish bros using your service?
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:51:07
yeah, I think I heard abut that.
Funny that most exchange look pretty much all alike on the trading platforms
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:04:57
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:02:59
thanks for that... I had not read that one
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:57:33
I have a friend that sells on ebay. The way he does it is like this:
* Finds item on Chinese websites
* Lists item on ebay &amp; makes the "sale"
* Collects money from ebay buyer
* Sends money to China to pursase said product
How in the world is this NOT money transmission? Is he not collecting money from buyer A and sending it over to Chinese seller B?
He is clearly receiving money from one party and then sending it to a third party.
Now lets say that the item in question is a bitcoin instead of a quadcopter.
What makes his business different &amp; not subject to money transmission licences when it comes to the quadcopter he sold on ebay vs. if he purchased a bitcoin from a website and sold it to a 3rd party?
Curruption at all levels, that's the difference!
@_date: 2015-04-01 01:16:21
Tipping Tuesday? First I hear of it. Are you doing this so new people can be introduced to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:07:01
[serious question] Is there a script out there that these people are using to create these exchanges?  Most of these exchanges are starting to look the same to me.
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:52:11
Most people that have been arrested (that I know of) have been selling them locally which is the exact same things that people with "other" paper currencies do.
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:27:40
What about if the Puerto Rican has a "Certificate of Puerto Rican citizenship" form the government? ;)
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:50:05

So Mineral is wordpress? And the exchange features are plugins?  How do they not get hacked all to hell?
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:51:05
This makes sense
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:25:14


Bitcoin can handle that for you as it has very low fees.
You can try it by sending bitcoins to this address
You'll be able to see that bitcoins has very low fees 
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:11:07
Yeah, most of my client's sites are built in wordpress which is why it shook me for a secong to think that the orderbook, trading etc was done via plugins.
Looking at the code for mineral it is obviously not that. 
But you're right, these sites look pretty much all the same so I am leaning towards thinking that someone out there is selling a script to trade alt coins.
... just wanted to get my hands on the script so I could read the code

Which the people that deal with paper currency (like named in the OP) are also doing and none of them are arrested.
Bitcoin can also be bought and sold just locally by a "network of people"
Edit: there are also ways to exchange the other paper currency for US dollars back and forth
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:34:09
Which is the hipocresy of the situation. He takes money from ebay buyer , goes through him, to china company. Classic case of money transmission if the rules were to be applied evenly.
So they sit there and make a "ruling" (note that it is not a law) to amend definitions (to their benefit) when the IRS says that btc is property and not a currency.
The .gov has to make up its mind, you can't have one section of the .gov saying that it is currency and another section of the same .gov saying that it is property and not expect people to be confused.
Yet, other paper currencies that circulate in the USA do not fall under the same money transmission crap.
Take special attention to this video from 1991. [Deli Dollars and Berkshire Farm Preserve Notes on CBS 1991 ]( these people literary printed their money AND sold those newly printed notes for dollars back and forth
[BerkShares on Fox News](
Take for example the Ithaca Hours, a currency that has been circulating in the USA for many years. Albeit local, it is a paper currency circulating since 1991  in the USA nonetheless:
The same has been done all over the place, the Calgary Dollars, the BerkShares and the countless others competing currencies. These are not hidden currencies either, they been plastered all over the news for years
[BerkShares on ABC News ](
[BerkShares on Fox News](
etc etc, yet how many times have you heard ANY of those people arrested for money transmission? They buy and sell these currencies for US Dollars for years and years and not ONE arrest?
The regulations and "redefining" definitions by fincen &amp; the states when it comes to btc is bullshit. Specially when I can come up with hundreds of videos / people that have their own currencies running and not one of them have gotten arrested ever!
 
@_date: 2015-04-04 03:17:07
So, buy btc in NY from 1 party at $200 Sell in the Bronx to another party for $300 requires the money transmission license.
Do this 10 times and you made $1,000
Do this 100 times and you made $10,000
and as long as it's local no license needed if your assumption is the case...
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:53:26
I think it would be a hell of a lot easier to just jump in my car and go to [S. Carolina]( where ther is no msb requirements...
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:53:28
That makes sense. 
But lets say that I am a simple trader and I register with Fincen since FinCEN registration is just that: registration. Fill out a form, click a button, and your business is registered.
Now, does that cover me and keeps me out of jail if I trade bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:47:06
Best answer on the web today. You, sir, win the internet for today.
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:51:34
Then, what would be the easiest way to fund bitstamp or any of the other major exchanges?
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:29:13
Was not aware Ally was btc friendly. Will look into them this evening.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:53:33
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:40:02
Like I said, I added a MC &amp; Visa and the system kees telling me no. No debit cards.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:48:34
Yet, the charge is “operating an illegal money transfer business”. So how does a single person that wants to buy &amp; sell bitcoin is supposed to be licensed?
I just called the [FL office of financial regulations]( and the poor guy said that "I don't think bitcoins fall under money service business".
Yet, people from Florida have been arrested for not being licensed, if that makes any sense to you.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:51:43
It is obviously a bank that has ACH system in place so why do they need to be 'trusted'?
Yet, I bet you that huge bank that was laundeing drug dealer cash (hsbc?) has the ultimate trust points.
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:55:13
I saw that, just waiting for verification :)
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:09:34
It is quite annoying the process that we go through. Besides coinbase, I started to look what would be the easiest way to fund an account on a big exchange like bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:15:48
How in the world did you use a **debit card** at coinbase? It does not allow any of my debit cards to be used within coinbase as it says it only accepts credit cards.
And, sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:27:18
I still have to wait extra 5 days
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:24:24
But buying btc to sell in lb has seen some people arrested. This is the reason I am looking for clarification.
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:48:53
So it is safe to assume that the owner of the address is the same for both the BTC and LTC correct?
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:08:36
They are bitcoin friendly as far as I know. So the $2.50 is no problem.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:06:44
Edit: Just received this email from Coinbase:
Hi Daniel, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.
Sometimes a purchase can be canceled if your bank account is not yet recognized as a trusted payment source. However, after manually reviewing your account I’ve removed any holds so that your future transactions should no longer be flagged. I’ve also pushed through the transaction that was canceled previously (at the original exchange rate you locked in), so you should have those coins soon.
I hope that helps! Please let me know if you need further assistance.
**To be fair I did send them a link to this post when I was beng ignored on their chat system**

That's the original pizza sold with btc. My little ones have purchase pizza (with my help) from dominos using btc through gyft. 
So now a medium bacon &amp; ham pizza is known as a 'bitcoin pizza' in my home.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:17:42
So far they are bitcoin friendly...
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:09:46
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:50:54
I do not plan to run an exchange, simply do some day trading by myself. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:11:28
Are you nuts? It is obvious that the payment went through and coinbase itself cancelled the buy at the very las minute and REFUNDED my bank account.
@_date: 2015-03-28 23:27:24
how did they know that you had a prepaid credit card?
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:34:50
In after giveaway but here it is anyway.
* Yes
* Seems easy to use and you're trying to get rid of scammer on the OTC market for btc
* It sucks that UNBANKED people cannot use your service. Not everyone has a bank account.
* When you add online buying methods, make sure you add **debit** cards. It should be easy enough to ask the buyer for their PIN during check out.
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:48:02
The funny thing is that I bought those $10 in bitcoins for my 12 year old kid and he was going to buy a "bitcoin pizza" for him and his little bro... 
(using gyft)
Not sure if he think I'm stupid yet, let me go ask him...
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:49:27
I am aware that the $2.50 outgoing ACH fee is the banks problem and nt coinbase. I have no problem paying fees if I can finnally get to the product I am purchasing.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:12:12
Nice to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:17:13
The problem was not waiting the 5 days which are now up to a 10 day wait. The problem was them cancelling the buy at the very last minute just because. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:14:20
You def should be a consultant.
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:04:29
[South Carolina]( is one.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:59:19
Not sure. On the phone now with the state to see.
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:19:16
