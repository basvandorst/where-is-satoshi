Thank you I'll definitely be checking out everything you listed, but how do you lsoe bitcoin as you already own it? I'm guessing if you put to much money into it you lose money both ways in turn?

Never mind �� there actually are thanks! ��

Thanks that's helpful i won't mine as I've heard a lot a bout not mining, I have a btc wallet on my phone and someone tipped me which was cool, but have you heard of pi crypto it's not something in circulation and I actually don't get why they're "mining from Ur phone" but it's on the app store or play store
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:46:20
Where would I buy it from? And if you have anymore sources on how to mine that would be much appreciated thanks I have the time but I don't understand how it will end up costing more and more money

�� If you knew where I lived I think you would understand as to why I'm actually having trouble with this myself, but thanks for the suggestion I'll look around for some social groups I guess, and I can't drink.... Legally ������

I do have a basic understanding of how it works but everywhere I look touch on it so lightly it's as if they don't actually want you to know what it is and how to get it....

*goes to dark web* "want a professional hitman/gamer" *mistakes it for professional hitman gamer leads a life of killing and earning bitcoin just to satisfy the monies*

So it's like PC's with the hardware? I still don't understand why it depreciates in a sense

@_date: 2019-06-03 13:50:25
Wow.... Well it's either legit or really well done ��
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:57:28
Yea thanks I appreciate it, and what sort of jobs are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:21:45
Yea I'm outside US, I suppose I could use a VPN?
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:41:53
Thanks for your time
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:31:25
If I'm not in USA? (I'm not obviously)
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:26:09
Yes it's probably what I will do, thanks for your time
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:35:05
Ok, well where I live it's not really used much in day to day unless you turn btc into gov currency, which you can do right? And I mentioned the dark web as if you buy anything from there always use btc it's the safest supposedly can't be traced and is the only type of currency that has actual worth
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:05:05
Thanks all info is helpful ��
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:04:40
I will consider it thanks ��
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:10:05
Thanks for your time I'm sure this will be a lot of help, I'm still in the process of learning how to build PC's I'm glad I havnt built one yet as I can probably build one to start of with as a btc miner and perhaps earn money that way and then get a gaming pc or if a mining rig is actually not as cheap as I think it is I'll stay away from it XD thanks again ��
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:20:53
I'm guessing it would be pretty easy to be hacked if you go on the dark Web with Ur phone or transact in btc?
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:02:31
Yea well I think I'll do my research today lol
