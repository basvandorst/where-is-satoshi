My thoughts exactly, this makes crowd funding, supporting content and a million other different cool projects so easily available. I really do think this type of technology could change the world

In my opinion you're completely wrong, tipbots such as Changetip is a just a application to help spread awareness of the amazing technology witch is bitcoin and cryptocurrency. An app such as Changetip could be the one that push's bitcoin into mainstream consciousness and that's when things could get really exciting and interesting.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:17:11
I sure hope so the implications of that would be incredible, I seriously see this Changetip thing taking off in the near future, look how fast it has already spread in the last couple of days in the bitcoin communality its mind blowing! 
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:24:05
Changetip is here to stay!
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:56:10
Here buddy, 10 bits welcome to the club! @_date: 2014-11-07 20:58:06
I think applications such as Changetip could have a huge impact on crowd-funding and supporting you're favorite content, it also gives an incentive for content providers to release a more quality product for there consumer as the better the product the more tips they shell receive. I also think technology such as this will give an incentive for businesses to be more transparent/creative and fair so this is really quite mind blowing if you think of all the possibility's.

Lmao 20 bits @_date: 2014-11-06 21:00:16
Not sure but Changetip &amp; bitcoin is a sure way to help musicians and artists in general to receive the funding you very well deserve for giving the consumer content. 100 bits for you're journey I wish you all the best on you're single @_date: 2014-11-06 08:02:44
Yeah man its pretty cool, I think with the ability to be so easily generous will bring allot of good to the internet and the world as a whole 
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:45:52
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:21:15
Yeah Changetip has made supporting you're favorite content as easy as liking a page, witch I believe will end up giving an incentive for content providers to create a more quality product. Everyone wins with Changetip!

@_date: 2014-11-06 21:22:09
Thank you my friend! 
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:19:56
I would love to be spending my bitcoin but the reality is there still isn't enough places that accept it yet, I actually would prefer to spend BTC over fiat. But saving has its own benefits especially in a dept ridden materialistic driven society such has this one. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:53:39
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:06:25
I agree mate, having the accessibility to be so easily tipped is creating a feedback loop of more and more people becoming generous, it also gives an incentive for content providers to create more quality content for the consumer so it benefits everyone! 100 bits for you my friend! @_date: 2014-11-06 21:16:29
Exactly! corruption has gone completely out of control and its time for a change, a decentralized change!
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:26:35
You're spot on my friend! those tiny tips could be worth a small fortune in the near future, I get personally excited with the smallest tip and don't think I could ever get sick of them. 100 bits! @_date: 2014-11-06 09:25:29
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:12:07
Thanks mate, appreciate it!

I agree, having the accessibility to be so easily tipped is creating a feedback loop of more and more people becoming generous, it also gives an incentive for content providers to create more quality content for the consumer so it benefits everyone. The possibility's are really endless and I think this is only the beginning, such a cool movement to be a part of. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:11:48
I think Changetip deserves to be reward they have created a very valuable service, that is not a problem as I perceive it.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:25:13
Smells like bs, if he really had that much BTC I think he would be a little more enthusiastic about becoming a multi millionaire 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:08:16
The success of this is definitely exciting and I'm super pumped to see where this will take us, cheers for the tip!

I personally don't use the kinect for Xbox and I'm assuming that's where you have a issue with the console? they don't force you to use it matter of fact most of there games you don't even need it to play. Xbox is just a gaming system they haven't asked for any of my personal information whats so ever.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:26:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:49:56
ChangeTip is one of the biggest most important steps to mainstream bitcoin adoption I have seen in a long times, I'm sure you can all tell with this new explosion of posts in the last few days but I have a feeling this is just the beginning. If one of these big tech company's like apple,google,facebook or twitter would really take the time to embrace it I think we would see a lot more people using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:20:29
The possibility's are endless, I think we are in the beginning stages of one of the biggest positive shifts the world has ever seen, that is if corrupt governments and oligarchs stay out of its way.

Thats big! great news
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:51:21
Would like to see this with more games in the future 
@_date: 2015-02-04 07:44:16
Very ineffective and expensive idea but I wouldn't rule it out especially from such institutions as traditional centralized banks
