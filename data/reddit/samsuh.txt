Hey PineapplePerson, 
Great to see you keep your philanthropic efforts going strong. If you need any help in the US, let me know. I'm based in Silicon Valley and work pretty extensively in the crypto space. I had started a project called the Blockchain Community Foundation, but would love to work together on goals that align. 
The main goals for the Community Foundation are:
1. **Blockchain Education.** This is for the general public through events like our recent "Cryptocurrency 101 with Coinbase" to encourage new user adoption with the goal of mainstream adoption, as well as developer training to supply more blockchain developers via such events as tomorrow's "Dapp Development Work Session for the WCEF Conference next week" and our developer focused "Blockchain AMA" series scheduled for the coming weeks.  The goal would be to essentially get all the benefits of the consensys academy but decentralized and open source. 
2. **To bring the community together** through meetups and events. I am based in the Bay Area, and help organize the World Crypto Economic Forum happening next week, which involves a Hackathon with over a quarter mil in crypto prizes, a crypto hiring mixer, as well as the dapp developer workshop mentioned above,which is all in addition to the actual conference itself which will feature speakers like Nick Szabo and a buncha other people. If you'd like to speak at this conference, let me know and I'll secure you a spot. 
3. Advising other nonprofits on how to integrate crypto to help reach their own fundraising goals. I love the work giveth is doing, but this still leaves existing charities behind. **I'd like to campaign for more adoption of crypto by existing charities to bring them up to speed.** This initiative will also give us user feedback to help improve blockchain UX from the ground up. 
Anyway, thanks for everything you're doing in the space. If there's anything I can help with, feel free to reach out. I'll keep checking in with you to see if I can help your efforts in any way. 
(business management, product management, community management, market/pr, content creation, event hosting, programming, and im also an attorney; if i cant do it, i prob know someone who can.)

In sf we do a regular whitepaper reading book club. Not sure how, but we can do something together if youd like.

ive been working on this. the blockchain community foundation. 
its goals are pretty useful to the community: 
1. educate and train more blockchain developers. particularly to convert existing senior developers from non-blockchain stacks into the blockchain stack. we have jimmy song teaching a class at the end of january, and getting local projects in the bay area to come and teach us about their architecture and code. 
2. to help establish regulatory and accounting frameworks and standards. i am working with several projects in the bay area including stanford law's blockchain group, in talks with blockchain at berkeley and berkeley law, and other smaller groups with this same focus. i also plan to be very involved in consensys' brooklyn project, which is handling consumer protection amongst other regulatory stuff. 
3. to bring the community together and encourage adoption of blockchain technologies. specifically, having more friendly meetups and conferences, which im doing now already. ive been helping set up some events, 
* conference: the "world crypto economic forum" in south sanfrancisco on jan 15-16. ( pm me if you want a discount code) which should be fun. nick szabo will be there, and lots of other speakers and cool people. 
* meetup: jan 9, cryptocurrency 101 with verity from coinbase
* meetup: jan 23, cryptocurrency hedge funds with founders from coinalpha, quantiacs, evercoin, bitbull capital and moderated by blockchain at berkeley
* meetup: feb 6, cryptocurrency law; shephardmullin, tokensoft, digiramp, legal.io 
There are other things that the community needs done, but which are not profitable to do like:
* creating general educational content, 
* maybe creating a free public space where people can come to work on cool projects and to meet other enthusiasts during the day, which can also be a venue to host blockchain project workspaces/ event spaces/ meeting spaces. 
* i also want to drive an initiative to help traditional nonprofits benefit by training them how to handle and accept cryptocurrency donations, and things like custody, security, and key management basics. 
* im also working with legalhackers, a community of about 50 cities of legal hackers, to put on a smart contracts hackathon around March of next year. stay tuned for more info on that. 
i've spoken with several cool people in the space, and theyve offered to help out in various ways, either by contributing funds, or volunteering their time to either be a teacher or to help in other ways. 
this project is just getting off the ground, and if you have any ideas for what else we can be doing, i'd love to get your feedback! if you want to help out, pm me and lets chat! ill make a proper announcement with all the verifications when we get some more stuff in order, and hopefully have the irs tax exemption so donations become tax deductible.

interesting. yeah we just want to help people do stuff. and it's across protocols, so we want to make this whole space more accessible, and more approachable.

we made a little intro video about a year ago. 
this is a general intro, so might be a good place to start. 
it also helps to join a community that talks about it, where you can feel comfortable asking beginner question. there isnt really a thorough curriculum-led program that i've come across that's good yet. there are some for development, and lots of youtube videos on intros. 
we have a cryptocurrency 101 coming up in a couple weeks with coinbase. i'll be sure to get the recording online.

is there a good write up that explains the flaws in various organizations so far? ive heard a lot of criticism for the bitcoin one, and some mixed opinions on the ethereum one. 
i have some experience from the traditional nonprofit world, so i'll hopefully be able to keep proper standards.

Wonder if you guys ever read this story:

How can *we* help **you**, Pineapple Person? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:22:52
someone highlighted your giving campaign and I wanted to reach out to let you know about a nonprofit I'm working on. I did a write up of it in that thread, and would be happy to start a conversation with you to see what you're looking to accomplish with your donations, and maybe help highlight some causes that align with your personal values. 
here's a link to the write up in the comments of another post.  
one of the goals is to help traditional nonprofits learn about crypto, and to become a helpful resource for newcomers into the space, and to promote this awesome and helpful community.

Thank you mysterious generous anonymous pineapple person. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:16:49
haha. there's actually a bit of story behind this. im not the person interviewing, nor the person being interviewed. im just behind the camera and tried putting this together logistically. we had to grab jeiji last minute for the video, and he helped us out by conducting the interview. we weren't sure if we would even put this online. this was really just practice for putting together a video. nobody knew how to edit a video, so this was a total amateur job, as im sure you can tell. 
you picked up on the audio thing well. we ended up having lapel mics, but i think the robe actually did end up muffling some of the sound. 
i'll be sure to change a couple things around for next time. is there any content you're particularly interested in? ill try to get it in the next video. thanks for the constructive feedback.
