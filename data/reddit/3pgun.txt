You think bitcoin only went through two cycles? Yikes, your research is insufficient

Look into some data science models on lookinbitcoin.com and you might realize that the patterns of the three models above are pretty similar in trend. Just my opinion.

Probability says it has a better chance going up than back to zero ;)

Rule number 1 of investing. Never borrow money to invest... defeats the purpose of “investing” lol

Is your pattern recognition okay? Lol

Well when you look at stock to flow models and take a look at the Mayer multiple (200 day moving average) in relation to the halving , and factor in that it costs around $7,000 in computing power and electricity to mine a single bitcoin then look at these last “two cycles” then it seems inevitable that the price will go up due to scarcity.

Simple, buy 50% dips and keep doubling down for the next 3-5years

Why spend my crypto when I can hodl it for exponential gains and give you shitty fiat in the meantime ;)
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:00:31
Go to a bitcoin machine... or buy it from exchanges that don’t require SS or ID

BTC= VR currency embedded in our society

This is a pretty bad generalization...All my friends who bought BTC when it was 20k sold all of there crypto and are currently traumatized from crypto as a whole
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:03:04
That is just showing you the sentiment on whether bitcoin is being overbought or oversold... not whether to buy or sell.... lol
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:27:43
Kinda looks like the current S&amp;P 500 lol
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:41:24
No, just some ETFs and bitcoin. Mainly holding cash...waiting to unload
