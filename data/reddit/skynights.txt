Looks nice but its notification system sucks balls.

Get out.

I hate coinbase. 
I will keep looking for that perfect app.

I love that place man. I can be a nerd when it comes to medieval stuff. 
I can’t wait for mount and blade 2 :)

Who would have thought that decentralization and free market can create wonders. 
I just can’t wait for monopoly over ISP and car showroom is gone so I can get Google Fiber 1Gbps for $55 and buy a Tesla directly from Tesla.

Hey, which app do you use for these bitcoin notifications?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:59:00
Google is facing all these regional monopoly laws over fiber and cable. Some towns even tried to build their own internet network to have ISPs lobby to block it.

I recently thought about buying Bitcoin, but I know jack shit and it's not accepted anywhere in my country. Only in the Internet and dark web shit. Which is way risky because I live in the Middle East. 
Other than an investment, I see no reason to get Bitcoin. 
Even then, I don't know how to buy it in the first place. I live in Saudi Arabia.

Is it because of the other 45 min video where he rage quit?

His conviction is irrelevant. To bitcoin. He sold explosives as fertilizer because he is an anarchist deep down.

Your name really checks out.

I am not sure that CoinBase is the best solution for bitcoin storage. I am not an expert but I heard time and time again that they store your wallet information and if they get compromised you might be too. I'd seek other solutions.

You all can see that there used to be a bubble and it burst. Which means one thing. It will burst again but it will rise even more going onward when more people get into bitcoin when it gets cheap again.

Don't downvote someone who is asking a question. It's better than who are STILL dismissing crypto-currency as a serious currency. 
My answer: The prices of bitcoin is determined by many thing, such as the difficulty, market price or cost of bitcoin miners and so on. As for the defining cost for your bitcoin sale, when you sell your bitcoin on some website, you get a recipe just like when you buy something from Amazon or Steam. Usually an email that you can print. And eventually the money comes into your bank account. 
However there are times when you buy something with bitcoin instead of cash, like NewEgg, Expedia, eGifter or Overstock. Or my favorite BitcoinWebhosting.
And with eGifter, you can buy Amazon Gift Cards and buy anything you want on Amazon.

I love Bitcoin, but being able to pay for my coffee, my gas and my grocery right out of my wallet (app) everywhere I go would be great.

It doesn't happen in this one. 
He is very respectful on this one.
