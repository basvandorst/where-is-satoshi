I noticed electrum suports new wallets with two factor authentication. Is this one in electrum recomended?

So 2FA is generally a good idea. But is it a good idea on electrum? I couldn't find too much about it online.

This article in dinside is from a few days ago. It gives a pretty true description of bitcoin, which has been a problem for a lot of norwegian news sites.

Then I think Electrum is the best alternative.
Wouldn't it be smart to write down the private key for a specific wallet?

I recommend Bitstamp.
I live in Europe and I can transfer to them within 3 days and free of charge.
They are reliable.
The fee starts at 0.5% and lowers acording to your monthly trading volume.
Just my 0.02 BTC.

I am completely certain you are right!

I can't find a .dat file.
Is it the same as wallet.key?
And would you please elaborate?

In Europe it takes 1-3 days. It usually takes 2 days for me.
