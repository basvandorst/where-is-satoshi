My condolences, bro. There are better jobs out there. Have you considered armed robbery? Sure, it's not nearly as immoral as working for a bank, but the glamor more than makes up for it. Plus, it's an honest living. Just sayin'.

Well, it can't crash and burn, stealing all of your life savings, if it doesn't first go up. All I see is another market manipulation luring in daft hands and loose wallets for another round of epic rapage. Buy now, lose later. Wise investors got in at 3K and will ride this second wave out, keeping their investment intact. Idiots will get in at 14k and wonder why they're living in a box in three months when it crashes back to 4k.

So, you're telling me that a cook does less work today for more buying power? I work in the service industry. I can assure you, aside from microwave technology, very little has changed. And you're correct. There are more people. My kitchen works non-stop to seat and feed the line of people out the door everyday, 24 hrs a day, 365. If anything, it's only gotten harder and harder to do this work over the decades. Sure, wage discrempency is there, but my father's dollar is still worth $6.45 and grandad's is over $10.

But their work is quite plainly tied to that devalued dollar. And not all new industries and opportunities involve prerequisites. An entire fleet of industries sprang into production the second marijuana was made legal in several states, and I know for a fact that a large number those growers, transporters, trimmers and tenders have nothing close to resemmbling an educated background in horticulture.
Not to mention the bloggers, article writers, vloggers, pro gamers, drone photographers. The extent of our latitude in the world as it relates to income, even for barely educated or illiterate individuals is staggering. We pay to see people that jump dirtbikes over helicopters. I don't think McDonalds is going to see a real glut in manpower anytime soon.

Consider that your audience is probably young, and may not have the cash to invest in. I think even 3-5 hundred is a little high.
People like round numbers. Even teens can gather up $100. I would start there. Advertise the starting amount, and play up the step-by-step nature of your content. Use click bait titles, people bitch about the clickbait, but they click it in order to do so. And it works.

Labor is the ability of mankind to produce change in the world. Nothing about the physical process of that change is altered over the decades. A hungry man will feel equally fullfilled by the product of a cook's labor in 1950 or 2050. The devaluation of the dollar is the only difference. Ah, so you choose to flee the discussion with boasts of victimization and false outrage. Typical troll. No spine. Can't handle real palaver.
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:17:07
Super pissed at another subreddit, so this may be less than cerebral. Sorry.
Greater work force to supply an even greater demand for labor, automation be damed. There are more jobs today than ever, and more opportunities to cultivate an income. There are whole industrues that didn't exist 20 years ago, and new ones are being created everyday.
Sure, there's more people, but demand for them in the workfirce is a hell of a lot higher than it was in gradad's day, when men would drift from town to town just to find a little work.
Job shortages make good headlines, it may not be factual. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:23:25
Still seems sketchy. Your best is to just wait.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:41:25
Your question is strangely worded. Are you saying more would benefit from a sudden moon, as opposed to slow steady growth? A real moon would replace steady growth in the short term, but the correction would likely result in the same original slope. If you are quick and savvy, sure, a moon can earn you a nice chunk of coin, but that's like betting the house will catch fire and you can retire on the insurance claim, rather than getting a real job. Hodlers will always win out in the long term.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:22:55
I assume there would immediately be a massive sell off which would correct down to about 8.25k, making such an investment highly risky for said billionaire. If they hodl for the remainder of the year, they could see a decent return, but I am almost certain it would trigger a lot of bags to be liquidated.
Things like this tend to happen quite often in smaller quantities, and it always seems to correct itself fairly rapidly. You must keep in mind the countless bots and conditional trades already on the markets. They don't trade on hype or hope, just price.

But it is a scam, albeit a scam that benefits all, just some a whole lot more. Work is devalued along with that dollar. You are a more worthless worker than your father, and your son will be worth even less.
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:55:50
Sure. Because people are incapable of negotiation. /s
Minimum wages force entry level employees to settle. There is no negotiating with an established wage cap set by the highest authority. You get what they tell you. You want to be compensated based on actual experience and skill, you have to prove it at every new job. There is no negotiation, and if thete us, it's over pennies and peanuts.
Also, an employer who doesn't fairly compensate employees won't have any.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:43:44
Piker? Typo? Hodl for long term gains. Trade for short term income. Not hard to comprehend.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:16:43
Except the value of the curency does not afford a worker today the same purchasing power the worker of yesterday enjoyed. Yes, you get more physical dollars, but they are worth less than a dollar used to be worth. Your father bought a home easier than you did, and your sons will have to work even more to afford less. And consider waitresses and waiters, who earn significantly less than even minimum wage ditch diggers, and must rely on the generosity of customers to close the gap. 20% is the standard tip, 20% of a sale that is worth less than it used to be. Someonr is getting shafted here. I don't think it's the fed.

It really depends on the difficulty. Don't bet on the price hitting 10k and spending against that right now. If you can't make it profitable in the short term, you may find you never will. Difficulty is generaly going to go higher, but there's no such trend for price.
Your best option might be to try and lower your overhead for mining. Maybe some cheap solar setup can help offset the electric cost, though the investment there can be tough to justify unless you get a real deal. Cooling your devices may help a little. Perhaps a waste heat recycling system to turn CPU heat back into electricity could offer some benefit.
People tend to use GPUs, so if you can find a deal on those, and can set them up to mine  you might fare better.
I have not tried mining at home myself, and cloud mining has turned out to be a net loss for many. Trading at the exchanges with a patient strategy seems to be the way to go right now. Buy low, sell high. It may be days or weeks between trades, though. Patience is key.

That was a bot, likely triggered by your donation wallet address. Nothing personal. If it's any consolation, I learned about the existence of bitcoin beggers subreddit because of your post.
I do not think BTC mining is going to be very profitable right now. Cloud mining is especially slow to grow, or completely dead.
Swing trading might be a better option, but even that is hard to pull off with the low volume recently. You could just hodl and wait for the market to improve before attempting to hone your strategies.
Lots of people are hodling bags of coin waiting for BTC to improve.

In what way? I work for one hour for min wage and I get 10 dollars. My father's labor in the 1970's earned him 2. His 2 dollars are worth more in purchasing power than my 10. Inflation has risen on average over 3% annually since 1950. A dollar then is worth over ten now. Explain yourself.

Bitcoin is backed by work done by compters consuming electricity. That's real hard backing.

I don't see the connection to bitcoin.

Right, best to swing trade. Daytrading is not lucrative with this volitility. Wrote many an unprofitable bot, swingers have more fun.

Stop being a whining jerk and telling me what to do. You don't want replies? Why did you write such an inflamatory post? You should have expected people would take exception to your title. I'd say rethink your actions, but that would imply you thought about them in the first place.

And yet, it rings true. The Federal Reserve, a privately owned bank, prints money with no backing to justify it, other than to keep the economy floating, while at the same time, inflation is making existing currency less valuable. A limit will be reached if this continues. That limit will be the amount of cash a person can physically carry to the store to buy food. Think wheelbarrels of hundred dollar bills for a single loaf of bread.

Labor is less valuable becuase the compensatory medium has been devalued, not the work being performed. A cook who makes a burger 50 years ago is woth the same as a cook who makes a burger today, according to the hunger of the consumer. The consumer must conpensate the cook for their work and product with something. That is what is worth less, and why the work itself is being seen as less worthy. It has nothing at all to do with the labor or the product.
