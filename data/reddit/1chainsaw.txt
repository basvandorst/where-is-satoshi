No not a password. It is security token of my design. The idea I am thinking about is you use a new cheap machine for a secure vault and wallet. It is still an idea. I created the above software (a custom Windows Credential Provider and smartphone client apps--sort of like a smart card to Windows ) in 2012 to eliminate password friction and offer multi factor authentication to login without the need to remember or manage a password. I designed it as an overlay to an existing infrastructure to work with Active Directory and LDAP systems. No one was interested in it, so it failed to see the light of day. Then I found bitcoin and thought it might be something of use in the bitcoin world.

**I believe I am right to use this, because I HAVE AND I AM implementing Military-grade top secret security.** How can I make such a claim? Simple, if you know the definition. Military-grade encryption refers to what's called AES-256 encryption. Short for Advanced Encryption Standard, it was the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect information at a “Top Secret” level. Hopes this helps. I have a step-down for those who do not or cannot employ Military-grade top secret security in their crypto key vault. They can use the weaker crypto community standard AES-128. I have implemented additional mechanisms that go even further in protecting the contents of the military-grade top secret crypto key vault. Thank ya'll for the awesome feedback!

Sorry, but you are totally wrong, on the wallets QR code :) Obviously, I am talking to what seems to be a bot or maybe one stuck in there first opinions or tainted by the past. This is good for me, because I can continue without the fear of replication. But it has been very helpful and for that I am grateful for your time and effort spent on me. Thank you I do appreciate it bad or good, honest or dishonest, it is all good and I am grateful to hear from others. Thanks for the feedback. I hope the rear of your day goes well.

Got it. Thanks for the potty training. I was recently born here. I'll try to make it to the toilet next time and not take a dump in your living room.

Not at all. Thanks for joining. What would you like to understand? The QR code? It is a unique token consumed by the smartphone and used in conjunction with the smartphone app to unlock the vault. I will discuss and make available all the gory details when I launch. If I expose my keys to the world someone with greater resources than I have will destroy any chance I have at making a dream come true. So do you like the idea or not?

This is a software I created in 2012 and I am thinking about refactoring it for bitcoin. It would let user secure their bitcoin under a secure account with encrypted content. Users could use their existing machines or purchase cheap clean machines and use them as a dedicated machine eliminating threats from use online or from downloaded malware or virus. Do you think this is a worthwhile project?

LOL...the words one spouts reflect their inner thoughts crying to be known and delivered in self deception. The attacks belong to the sadistic souls roaming looking for acknowledgement, and I am brought from above to service and comfort the poor rotting spirits waiting to fade into the abyss of their own ugly sounds reverberating throughout their hollow heads where brains once lived until rot and hate consumed the space they inherited to a point of void and sad laughter. We are all victims to ourselves and can only escape our pain by casting it upon others making us feel better for a short while. I will allow you to digest your meal and listen for your howl for more food. I shall serve if I can. Bless those so shallow they only know hate.

Cool, what should I replace with? Or just remove? Thanks for the FBK.

Better is... Turns any laptop into a vault for...
and...Securely sign transactions in the vault.

Is that your way of saying get the f out of here. Oh, wait I see your name is meant to bash, so I am honored you find me valuable enough to waste your time on. Thanks for reminding why we still call it a jungle. Amazing what the right bait will catch :)

This is why I am investing my heart and soul in delivering a solution I have coined :) Crypto Key Vault™. Turn any low cost new or old windows machine into a military-grade (AES-256) top secret vault for storing crypto keys, material, and digital assets. It uses multi factor authentication to unlock the vault and let's you sign transactions in the vault so the keys are never exposed. It is under development and I will create a reddit for it when it is far enough along and I need feedback and testers. Thanks for posting on this extremely important aspect of living on the crypto edge.

Good advice. Problem is folks forget, misplace, or lose the paper. Or natural events destroy their location. So print it and rent 2 deposit boxes at different locations far enough apart there is little chance of a natural event wiping out both. Obviously, this is for someone with a sizable amount to safeguard. And yes, I get the irony of using a bank. But it could be a couple laptops too loaded with Crypto Key Vault™ or just the paper, that you secretly store away in two commercial storage rentals located far apart. Bottomline is no longer is it just passwords we must diligently concern ourselves with but our new crypto keys too and in many ways far more valuable and perishable.

Let me know what you think and if you want to help me. I am a lone developer who wants to help the 5 billion people in our world that are shut out and held down. This is my first step to empowering them. From the funds and volunteers I receive I will deploy to my stealth blockchain project with the purpose of empowering the 99% that have little to no financial opportunity, but collectively hold the greater power over the few who hoard the wealth!
