Yeah, but do they have Dash yet?

Dude probably owns some anyway, though.

I'm trying to work on a solution for the routing problem, but it's extremely difficult. That's the main problem that's holding back BTC's growth going forward.
However, the fact that you see my complaints as whining is comical to me. Your arrogance won't change the fact that this systemic problem is still unsolved and poses an existential threat to BTC, if it goes unsolved for long enough. And no, I don't think increasing block sizes will scale indefinitely, either. I'm thinking a better 2nd layer solution to LN, (look up open transactions. It looks promising.) or maybe an add-on to LN, may be necessary for long-term, sustainable growth.
What do you offer the space? What have you done, other than reiterate talking points and spout insults?

How do you figure, if blocks are already full when we're in a downtick in usage currently?

Segwit worked a bit, but still isn't widely used, and wasn't all that effective of a scaling solution anyway, because at best it doubles or triples transaction volume, but growth marches on exponentially, so linear solutions naturally have limited lifespans.
If LN will ever be widely used, (which still isn't clear) it isn't ready for prime-time yet, unless you consider a few centralized nodes running the entire payments network to be "ready for prime-time." LN routing is still a hard, unsolved problem. It's not clear routing on LN will ever be solved, but it's quite clear it won't be solved and implemented in time to avoid running into the block size limit and the explosion of the mempool size again.
Long-term, LN may be a great scaling solution, but it's not a great idea to bet the success of the whole project on something that's barely off the ground. There's a process to doing a PoC, then testing, then a limited pilot, then production. The process can't just be leapfrogged without consequences and huge failures.

*Improving* scaling is inadequate when demand is accelerating faster than scaling solutions can accommodate. Better solutions are needed when that happens, or the system will fail.
Imagine if your ISP ran out of bandwidth for a few hours, or your city's roads weren't adequate to accommodate people driving home from work until 12AM, or your employer didn't have enough cash to cover payroll for a few weeks.
*Those* are equivalent problems to inadequate scaling. Your employer having "improved" finances wouldn't matter if they still couldn't meet demand. (payroll)

It's just a shtick. I wouldn't be surprised if it comes out that he and Peter Schiff, among others, were paid to "hate" bitcoin and other cryptos, because their arguments are basically "I don't like it, so you're stupid if you do", which is uncharacteristic of even these guys.

Not when the fees go back to $50 per transaction...or higher.

True, except the interest paid to the Fed is refunded to the Treasury, effectively forgiving the debt.
"The yearly remittances to the Treasury are essentially the leftover Fed revenue after operating expenses. By law, this additional revenue must be turned over to the Treasury."
