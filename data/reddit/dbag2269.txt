I say you buy it off of her. Offer her about 10k, and take it off her hands. Keep it in the family ����

You get your bitcoin for whatever price is was at that exact moment when you pressed that pretty little “buy” button.

As am I. I just figure the Bitcoin Utopia we’re all hoping and praying for is a bit of a ways a way, so I figure I take care of all my fiat responsibilities first, save a bit of my fiat, and invest some into BTC, but if I had a 50k fiat payment I was responsible, I for damn sure wouldnt invest almost all of my cash into BTC. 
I guess its just a difference in perspective. I see this as a long term thing, so Id rather toss in a bit of cash here and there, and still take on reality with the hopes this  really does take off. Compared to going all in, and putting real life responsibilities on hold (or at least attempting to)

I guess I just cant rationalize the thought process myself. I dont need pics or anything. It makes no difference to me. Hopefully we all win brotha. 
Big risk big reward. 
Can you explain your rationale to me tho? Im genuinely curious why someone would make such a move.

I use coincap. Not the best Id assume, but it gives me a relatively good idea on how everythings going

Bovada, or Betonline. I prefer Betonline, They give you a nice little bonus when you deposit with their promo code!

After a while of accumulating I finally got 1 whole BTC. and now Im more hungry for more than ever before. Can you guys all make sure the price stays here until I get my tax return? Ill make sure to repay you in a few years when BTC finally gets to millon dollars... please? :)

Im assuming everyone in this sub is in possession of $5100 in some form. So why is that not very smart? 
@_date: 2019-04-07 01:53:25
You dont have to be a coiner to have $5100 in assets. You just have to be a functioning adult. If you dont have $5100 to risk... you shouldnt be investing in BTC.

That wasnt what I was trying to do, but I hear you. My bad.

I figured asking how Bitcoin is better than XRP qualified as “on topic” for the Bitcoin thread, but ok understood.
