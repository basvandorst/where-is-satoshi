What sold my on Bitcoin is...
Offline currencies are no longer moving, you can save money at a bank, however interest rates have dropped, you’ll just end up with less after a few years (because inflation making your money worth less). 
Cryptocurrencies (not only BTC) are rising and instead of the money at your bank, will keep on rising (at least for the coming years) with percentages you’ll never get as interest in a year at a bank.
Don’t start with Bitcoin to flip or make quick profits, just invest whatever you would normally save up for later in your life. The term here is “HODL” which means just hold on to your coins, even when the value it dropping (it’s always going back up after) and some people force the value to go down to cause panick (so prices go down further) and they can buy more coins for a lower price again.
Keep whatever you can miss, so what you’ve normally would’ve put on a Bank Account. Invest it in BTC (or split it a little with LTC/ETH) and you’re both safe and making more money then collecting that 0.10% interest from your bank.
 Hope this helps you a little bit, I’m not sure if you just want someone to convince you to go all in, or like me to just put in whatever you would store on the bank normally. Because that’s what I would advice. :)
Also, why BTC? It’s the one always in the mainstream media, there’s no chance the media/mainstream people will talk positively about putting their money in “yet another” crypto if this one crashes and everyone loses money. So it’s just the safest option (atleast for a few more years). It’s not the best option, so slowly better coins will get more popularity and BTC will slowly move to the background (but that’s in a few years)
