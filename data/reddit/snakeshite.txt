Old people who have a little bit of money and don't know what to do with it.

I'm with you. I almost bought some BTC on localbitcoins. In theory it should be brilliant but there are too many dbags out there to risk it. Especially where I live.
Thanks for the word of warning OP.

The fact that he didn't logarithmically scale takes all his credibility away. Doesn't matter that he called it first.

Greed is getting the better of you. Trying to be sneaky like smeagol.
You should have anticipated the value could rise or fall.

Cool, thanks for the advice. Natanael recommended the same thing so I will give that ago.

Thanks for the pointers.
I managed to get Linux Mint on a live USB. Is this the right way to do it?
If I install electrum won't it just delete it the next time I boot up? Or do I need to do a proper install of linux

You made some excellent points. I'm sure many people feel that way, especially at the start. It is for the reasons you stated that bitcoin has got a long way to go. I consider myself pretty technically minded, but I had a hard time getting my head around cold wallets and making sure I don't fuck up along the way. 
It's this barrier that stopped me a year ago when I should have invested. It's also the barrier that lets us get in now before bitcoin gets really mainstream and the price soars (we hope).
I have a feeling with all the money flowing around things are going to get better for the average user of bitcoin. Imagine if google get there hands on creating something for bitcoin, could be insane.
