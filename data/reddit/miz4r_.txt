So should we trade on a different exchange? How are they any safer? Also this is not r/bitcoinmarkets , only a small number of people actually trade here. If you don't trade you don't keep your coins on an exchange, at least that would be really stupid.

Bitgo had withdrawal limits you can't just remove, Zane said himself that they don't know how those limits got bypassed. So add 1+1 together and you come to the conclusion that BitGo also must have been compromised in order to remove those limits. It makes no sense that anyone with a BitGo account could just remove those limits themselves, then why even have them in the first place?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:21:31
Bitgo had been compromised as well since their security measures were bypassed, that shouldn't have happened on their end.
@_date: 2016-04-12 22:54:45
What's up with these Gavin fanboys? Everything Gavin does is good, even if he says something stupid he's still the great one who knows what's best for Bitcoin.... ugh
@_date: 2016-04-13 12:38:11
Well those with a greater level of knowledge and experience deserve a louder voice I think, they have earned the respect of the developer community and therefore will be listened to. I don't see any other way how this should work. If I had only delivered a few lines of code myself I wouldn't expect to get as much respect from my colleagues as someone who has contributed much more and has a lot more knowledge and experience than me. That's just the way things work, there's no place for big inflated egos here without the knowledge and hard work required to bring this project further.
@_date: 2016-04-13 11:02:51
And that's a good thing, one single person can't decide what changes will be made, if there are significant objections against it among the developers then the change will not go through. You get proper peer review and discussion with so many people involved before changes are made and that's how it should be.

Remove the direct links.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:13:15
Then Bitgo also bears responsibility here. Clearly Bitgo's security measures were also circumvented somehow, and that's not Bitfinex's fault.
@_date: 2016-04-13 00:29:24
Core is not one guy or even one entity, there's like 100+ Core devs working on the code and each of them have their own opinions and personality. I find it ironic how people who love Bitcoin and its decentralized nature just look at this one guy to tell them what's good or bad.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:19:30
I am diversified like I wrote earlier. But it's simply a fact that Bitcoin is the least volatile because it is the most liquid of all the coins out there. How Bitcoin did compared to other coins in 2017 means very little long term, plenty of coins outperformed Bitcoin in 2013 but are now nowhere to be seen. Bitcoin started 2017 with a marketcap of $20B, it's much hard to grow tenfold from there than for a 1-year old coin that started with a marketcap of $200M in 2017. Let's compare the numbers again in 2020 and see whether these altcoins actually have any longevity like Bitcoin has. I am very doubtful.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:49:02
Why? ETH is more volatile than BTC, it recently dropped from $1424 to $722 within 4 days and has seen wider fluctuations in value the past year. ETH also has seen way more security flaws than BTC. To give ETH a higher score just because its transaction fees are a bit lower right now seems like a very shortsighted and biased look.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:23:39
I doubt the NSA would have given their digital world currency the properties Bitcoin currently has. Kinda hard to control as it is. And why would it matter who Satoshi is or what his motives were? The code is open source so can be thoroughly checked by every capable programmer in the world.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:09:10
They failed to remove them from developing Bitcoin, they wanted to remove them because most of the Bitcoin devs disagreed with increasing the max blocksize with a hard fork at this moment and they didn't like that. So they created their own fork Bitcoin Cash with bigger blocks and without Segwit and barely are able to sustain more than 15% support for it and wonder why that is. This is a list of the people who have contributed to the Bitcoin code since 2009:  . Many others also contribute by doing peer review, testing, reporting issues and things like that.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:10:48
Oh please... what are you trying to proof here? Are you perhaps a banker who's afraid Bitcoin is going to eat your lunch so you resort to fear mongering about the security of my cold storage wallets? Don't bother I am not worried about my private keys, I have never lost a single penny in coins during five years using many different wallets. I feel much better with my money sitting on a Trezor than I do with it sitting on a stupid bank account so the bank can lend it out at interest while my wealth is slowly evaporating due to inflation. No thanks I choose to be my own bank with Bitcoin.

You can also call it experience, I've been through several 80%+ correction before in Bitcoin and have seen it come back from that. At some point you start to understand the market cycles these things have to go through and you zoom out and see the bigger picture that is developing.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:38:28
They are not to blame either, can't expect all these newbies to know what Segwit is and how to use it. If the exchanges and wallets implement it then users will automatically be using Segwit without knowing it when they create their wallet or use their exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:42:09


There may still be some unidentified security vulnerabilities, I'll give you that, but as more time goes on without hackers successfully breaking into these devices it becomes less likely they will be able to do so in the future. I'm not worried anyway because I'm using a passphrase which is an additional layer of security on top of everything else. So even if in the extremely unlikely scenario someone manages to get their hands on my Trezor and knows how to expose the private keys from it I will still be safe. I think I'm fine but thank you for your concern.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:02:47
There are several developments in the pipeline that will help fungibility for BTC like Lightning Network, TumbleBit, MimbleWimble and Coinjoin implementations. Monero is nice but it's not really needed to preserve fungibility. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:45:24
Bitcoin being the biggest, most stable and most secure crypto-asset should have the highest grade as an investment into this space in my opinion. Generally you don't want to recommend more volatile assets as better or more sound investments.
Ethereum may seem promising but there's lots of competition coming up for it in the space and it's still very young compared to Bitcoin. To give it a higher rating than Bitcoin with its solid 9+ year track record seems ridiculous to me. And I do like Ethereum, but you have to try and be more unbiased as a serious rating agency.

Haha even more silly FUD from you, you're regurgitating old news man. First of all that security issue was fixed a long time ago and second not one single person lost money due to this issue because it was pretty hard to execute and fixed quickly after this was known. Next please.
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:22:37
Core is not stalling and preventing bitcoin from growing at all, quite the opposite really. They're very busy improving the network and laying the groundwork for actual scaling without hurting the network or decentralization. You just can't see the forest for the trees here and have a very myopic viewpoint. I would suggest you listen to some other knowledgeable people besides just Gavin.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:45:17
It's possible, but the problem is that good developers are kinda scarce and the best ones flock to the oldest, most battle tested and most valuable crypto in this space which is Bitcoin. Pretty hard to compete with that, but I'm optimistic there will be several altcoins that will fill a usecase Bitcoin can't optimally fill. Right now scaling is a huge issue which some altcoins promise to solve, and sure we're seeing a lot of money go towards that in this space right now. But I think Bitcoin will solve this issue and we'll see money flow back into it once this becomes more apparent. We're seeing huge amounts of FUD around Lightning Network which is meant to scare people and prop up alts and also give the smart money more time to accumulate BTC, but I am pretty confident this FUD will be blown away once we're starting to see real world implementation and usage of LN. Still I don't think it's a bad idea to have several different crypto within your portfolio though.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:30:45

I am already using Segwit. Do you even Bitcoin bro?
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:41:28
Not really because we can simply switch to a new algorithm with a hard fork if SHA-256 turns out not to be safe. And if they can break SHA-256 they can also hack into bank accounts and pretty much everything else.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:04:39
Uhh what? Segwit already activated back in August 2017 as a soft fork. You are free not to use Segwit but then you won't benefit from lower fees either. It's your choice. If it was a hard fork you wouldn't have a choice.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:19:51
Short term maybe, but longer term the increased block space and lower fees will attract more people and more usage and thus increase total fees per block.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:19:08


That's true, the only difference between the two is that Bitcoin Cash copied the blockchain history from Bitcoin just like Bitcoin Gold and many other forks do. But conceptually there's not really a difference.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:50:33
You're comparing apples to oranges here. Around 650k BTC was stolen from MtGox, which was worth around $400M at the time. We're not sure yet how much money was stolen in this case, but even if it's double the amount it's still a lot smaller relative to the total market value of crypto. Losing $400M in a $8B market is a lot more impactful than losing $800M in a $500B market. Also I doubt the amount lost here is even close to $800M but we'll have to wait until we get more information.

@_date: 2018-01-03 01:31:25
Yeah I'm sure the many billions of dollars locked up in these wallets isn't enough of a bounty yet for these hackers, better wait until Bitcoin is worth a few trillion right? The odds are much higher that you will lose all your money sitting in a bank account or all your precious metals sitting in a vault than the odds that someone is going to hack the private keys of your hardware wallet.
And inflation doesn't impact me at all. Stuff increases in fiat price not in Bitcoin value, I can buy a lot more stuff now with the Bitcoin I have than I could last year. Don't know if you've looked at a chart lately, but I don't think Bitcoin holders are exactly complaining about their coins losing value over time.


Great, as long as they stay away from my money. And if they take too much risk and lose their money they should not expect a bailout but just fail and die like any business should.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:53:31
Bitcoin Cash forked away on August 1st 2017 the same way Bitcoin Gold and even Litecoin was created as a fork of Bitcoin. Segwit was activated on August 23rd as a soft fork, a completely different date. It's just mind boggling the ignorance showed in this report.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:56:11
It's still a fork of the Bitcoin codebase with some adjustments made, just like Bitcoin Cash except Litecoin decided to start over from a new chain.

My private keys have been created offline and are kept offline, no worries there. And wanna-cry type viruses can't shut down the bitcoin network, you don't understand it if you believe it can. And the funds at my bank are only insured up to a certain amount and if I lose my funds due to my own irresponsible behavior I don't get anything. I will gladly bear the extra responsibility of keeping my own money secure and safe in Bitcoin if that means I no longer have to bailout banks for their own stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:33:14
Do you understand that we as individual people never get bailouts when we screw up? That only too big to fail banks have this special privilige? Do you understand that that's exactly the reason why we got into Bitcoin? You and this drunk uncle have a lot to learn, but history is a great teacher.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:46:48


That's nice and all but pretty meaningless. Litecoin grew more than Bitcoin back in 2013 also, but it also dropped a lot harder and deeper in the bear market of 2014-2015. Alts are simply more volatile so their peaks will be higher but their lows will also be lower. Alts do not solve the problems Bitcoin has, at least not the purely blockchain based alts. And the DAGs out there still have a long way to go to proof themselves in the real world. The Lightning Network alone is not the magic bullet, but together with the other developments in the pipeline it might be. There is not one single magic bullet in crypto that will solve the scaling issue, and if someone claims they've found it I'd be very very skeptical.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:01:35
You pay lower fees if you use segwit, seems like a good enough reason to me.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:40:33
What are you talking about? The dips in LTC and ETH were way worse than the dips we've seen in BTC. Did you forget that ETH was at 0.15 BTC at one point in time and then it dropped all the way to 0.024?  Neither of those coins do anything better than BTC does on a fundamental level, and ETH has its own set of problems besides just scaling.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:33:49
You're going to miss out on a lot of dips then, the only time this has happened in Bitcoin was in 2011 and 2015. Some might say that the period between the two bubbles in 2013 also counts but that was too short of a bear market in my opinion and hope didn't seem lost to me. Felt more like a nice buying opportunity which it was.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:51:33
Below $1000 would give me some pause, it could still recover to new highs then and be a temporary dip but it would take many years. Something like $3000-4000 would still be nothing out of the ordinary for Bitcoin, I'd still be a happy hodler then. :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:04:35
No it's not. What difference does it make for real world usage or functionality of the coin? Does Bitcoin Gold do something better or different just because it shares the same history and forked off from the original Bitcoin blockchain at a certain date? No it doesn't, it is just as much an altcoin like Litecoin is. Litecoin could have kept the Bitcoin genesis block too and it would still be the exact same coin with the same characteristics that make it different like 2.5 min blocks, scrypt algorithm and the 84M coin cap.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:37:23


Many who got in early also sold too early. I don't know of many people who were early to the game and still have the same amount of coins as they had back then. Including myself, I got in when BTC was at $70 but since have sold quite a few off and wasn't able to buy back as many.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:54:11
Use a hardware wallet with a passphrase, and keep only a small amount of coins in the non-passphrased wallet in case of a robbery, and keep the rest of your coins in the passphrased wallet. Another way is to store your hardware wallet safe somewhere else.

It's a mystery and lots of people have searched for him or came up with theories, especially the media. I think it's better to stay a mystery, the technology should not be about the person who created it.
And we're definitely moving towards a cashless society, the question is which one will we end up in? One where all digital money is centrally controlled and governments can simply push a button to lock you out of access to your money, or one where digital money is completely decentralized and nobody can lock you out? I prefer the latter, and I know Bitcoin provides this so I am supporting this cause with everything I got because I know the alternative will lead to absolute tyranny.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:02:38
Ok then you don't understand how forks work, that's fine. Keep using 'classic' Bitcoin, while I keep using SegWit saving 50% on fees. Choices are great aren't they? :)

Use Coinbase to buy, then later on if you've bought a substantial amount I would buy a hardware wallet like a ledger nano or trezor to safely store your coins on. You can keep the coins on Coinbase but then you have to trust them to keep your coins safe. There are also mobile wallets but I wouldn't put too much money on them. On a hardware wallet the coins (or rather the keys to your coins) will be in your own hands and you don't have to trust someone else to keep them safe for you. I would recommend to google some info about hardware wallets first though before you do that. Above all it's important to research and better understand what it is you're investing in.

It was his to begin with, he gave the bitcoin to them as a gift and then they lost it. I gave my cousin some coins as a gift 7 years ago and he also lost it, I told him it would be worth a lot one day but he didn't listen and was careless. It just doesn't feel right to reward him for his carelessness by saying I have kept a copy of the keys. He can buy some at the current price and if I feel like he learned his lesson he'll get the keys back.

Fees are a short term problem due to heavy traffic and increasing interest in Bitcoin, real solutions are being worked on. Increasing the blocksize is not a real solution and will lead to the same problems while it bloats the blockchain and risks centralization. Be patient, only concern trolls are so short term focused and don't want you to look at the longer term developments. It takes time to develop this tech into its full potential, if we rush it we can't turn back the time to undo changes that will lead to Bitcoin losing its censorship resistance.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:34
Bitcoin won't be useful as a transaction medium for quite a while yet. It needs to become bigger and more stable first, and only then more people will become comfortable using it to buy and sell stuff with. Altcoins are even more volatile than Bitcoin, so they are not going to be used much as a transaction system either at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:30:29

Segwit makes transactions cheaper by them being smaller in size/weight, it does not change how much satoshi/byte you have to pay to get included in a block. You only pay fewer satoshis because the number of bytes a segwit transaction takes up is smaller.

Yeah good luck to the banks controlling 51% of the Bitcoin hashing power. And even if they managed to do so, they can only rewrite the last couple of blocks at most as it gets progressively more difficult to rewrite the blockchain further back. It's also a super expensive undertaking and can be easily thwarted if needed by changing the PoW algorithm. Not going to happen.

I can see you've never run a full node yourself. With 8MB blocks it would take a whole lot more than just 34GB/month as you need to both download and upload those blocks to other nodes in your network.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:05:18
A segwit address starts with a '3' or 'bc1', while non-segwit bitcoin addresses start with a '1' usually. Electrum uses the 'bc1' address format which is called bech32 or native segwit, which is the one that will save you the most on fees but not all exchanges recognize these addresses as valid Bitcoin addresses yet so you might need to contact your exchange if you want to send BTC to a native segwit address. Sending from a native segwit wallet shouldn't be a problem though. You can start using segwit on electrum by downloading the latest client on electrum.org and then create a new wallet with segwit. If you still have an old non-segwit wallet on electrum you need to send your funds to your newly created segwit wallet. Make sure before you do this you have access to your backup seed (12 words I believe) of your old wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:37:03
The fee situation is caused by lots of new users joining the ecosystem right now so it's a first world problem really. The attack consists of Bcash shills using the fee situation (and probably helping make the situation worse by spamming the network) so they can badmouth Bitcoin and spread propaganda for their own coin. I hope we see some more Segwit adoption come from this, as it is the only available method we have right now to alleviate the fee pressure.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:27:40


Users definitely care about paying lower fees which implementing Segwit helps with. Most (new) users don't even know what Segwit is so obviously they aren't asking for that in specific, but lower fees is definitely a priority among them!
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:44:35
Why can't you move them to the segwit wallet right now? A 170 satoshi/byte fee is enough to move your coins into a segwit wallet within a few hours at this point. Tomorrow it will probably be even cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:12:37
You're wrong, this is not user error the transaction should be visible in the mempool on a block explorer even without confirmations.

I know so many people alone in my social circle who buy some bitcoins and then send them to other exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex and who knows what else just to speculate or buy other crypto. It's not just Coinbase there are many exchanges out there and they account for a lot of traffic onchain. 80-90% is just my guess, unsupported by evidence just by observing what people around me are doing with their coins.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:04:37


I don't, but it's okay to have that opinion just can't force the network to upgrade that way. Soft fork was the only option here for BTC. BCH could have done this when they hard forked away, a missed chance for them in my opinion.


This problem has already been addressed by Peter Todd:

Blocks would fill up pretty fast to 8MB if the space was available.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:11:39


That graph doesn't proof anything, it just shows how quickly blocks fill up with a 1 MB limit. Even in 2016 blocks were often full and people were complaining about the fees, which slowed down the growth of confirmed transactions per day. I'm pretty sure that with 8MB blocks we'd very quickly fill up the free space until we hit the limit and fees start going up.

No it only makes a difference if you want to receive btc into a bech32 segwit address, not many wallets or exchanges support that yet. Miners mine both segwit and non-segwit transactions so getting confirmations isn't the problem here.

Adoption takes time, and grows in spurts. The new wave of adoption we've been seeing this year is unprecedented and demand for blockspace has went up equally. If not for the fee market and limited blockspace we'd easily have filled up 8MB blocks by now. Look at Ethereum where cryptokitties quickly filled up the Ethereum blockchain to its current maximum capacity of around 1M transactions per day.

Those Chinese miners in unsecure warehouses have implemented segwit since August this year. Whatever you may think the miners do not control Bitcoin. If that were true we wouldn't have been able to stop the segwit2x hard fork, or we wouldn't even have seen segwit on the network at all.

Look at  , those are all pending transactions sitting in the mempool. The grey area is the 100-140 satoshi/byte fee region which are mostly not being mined just yet, but anything above seems to be going through within a few blocks. So right now I would set a custom fee of 150-160 satoshi/byte if I wanted to have my transaction confirmed within a couple hours. If you really want to get confirmed in the next block you need a fee of 800+ but I think that's a waste of money personally for saving 1-2 hours of time at most.

I GPU mined back in early 2013, and later with ASICs until mining became too competitive and the bear market in 2014 and 2015 killed profitability. I have made plenty of mistakes and could have gotten rich if I hadn't made them, but that's life and I can't complain really. I have learned a lot due to my mistakes and that's more valuable to me personally. I am and always have been super optimistic about Bitcoin's future though, I love all the energy and developments that are in the pipeline right now. I am skeptical a new crypto will take over, but if it's a really good one that allows me the same kind of freedom and control over my money I'm all for it. Bitcoin does have some problems right now but I don't think these problems are insurmountable. This is still early stage for crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:35:05
Basically it's a difference in vision in how to scale Bitcoin for global adoption. Bitcoin and its current team of developers believe that we need further optimizations and higher layer solutions in order to scale while at the same time keep the properties that make Bitcoin unique and valuable like decentralization and censorship resistance. Bigger blocksizes will probably be needed in the future but should not be our focus right now, as increasing the blocksize is a very inefficient and wasteful method to scale. We just have to live with somewhat higher transaction fees right now so we can get a more healthy and stronger network in the future. This is Bitcoin Core's vision and it is shared by a large part of the community right now.
Now Bitcoin Cash and its supporters have a different vision, they believe it's more important to scale right now through the easiest and most simple solution available which are bigger blocksizes. They don't seem to think that bigger blocks will lead to more centralization or they believe that lowering fees right now is more important than whatever issues may arise through bigger blocks. For some reason they don't like Segwit though, which is a new upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol that doubles the blocksize and solves issues like malleability and quadratic hashing scaling and paves the way for second layer solutions. And there you have it, both sides of the debate brought down to its essence. There is a lot of mud slinging and conspiracy theories thrown around from both sides but if you ignore all that the above is what it all boils down to.

There is evidence by looking at Ethereum, or just look at the rising fees which means demand for BTC blockspace has obviously been increasing. Besides if organic growth somehow wouldn't fill up the blocks spam would since it's cheap for attackers to spam it up to the max. Either way you can't just assume that 8MB wouldn't be filled if the space was available, it would be very irresponsible to do so from an engineering's standpoint.

Using Segwit saves you around 30-40% in fees right now with everything else being the same, and if you use native Segwit (bech32) it saves you more than 50%. So $0.75 is still not likely to get you included in a block quickly right now even when using Segwit, but $10 probably will.

Immutability doesn't mean you can't fix critical bugs when they are found or even that a hard fork should never ever happen, as long as there is wide consensus among the entire ecosystem for it. The 21M coin limit is actually part of the code that is supposed to be immutable, the above overflow bug changed that so obviously the network quickly came to consensus that this had to be fixed to keep the 21M limit.

Bitcoin can be useful in many ways, but it can't be useful in every single way right now. It's useful as a form of digital gold to me, a store of value outside the control of banks and governments. It's borderless, it's censorship resistant and allows me full control over my own money. That is pretty damn useful to me. I can wait for the tech to be developed that will also allow Bitcoin to become useful to me for doing smaller transactions.

As for what Kraken said about market manipulation, I think that quote is taken a bit out of context there. Market manipulation is rampant in all markets and it's pretty much a fact of life. As a trader I accept that as a fact and deal with it, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Regulators can say and do whatever they want but they're blind to reality if they think regular markets are not being manipulated on a daily basis by parties with very deep pockets (banks, etc.).

A lot, perhaps up to 80-90% of all onchain transactions. With the current wave of newcomers buying their first crypto and sending them to their wallets or between exchanges to buy other crypto it's bound to be a lot.

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:19:02


No we don't. Segwit isn't even fully adopted yet, 90% is still doing expensive non-segwit transactions and they are the reason blocks are still only max 1.1MB on average. Ask Coinbase to adopt Segwit asap, and other big parties responsible for many Bitcoin transactions.

I don't see how volatility affects user experience here in combination with long confirmation times. User experience is affected when confirmation time takes (too) long, right I agree. But why would the user care about volatility? Sure while the transaction is busy confirming the price could have gone up or down a lot, but this makes no difference to the user whether the confirmation time was long or short. You pay for something and then a few hours later the price of a Bitcoin has gone up 20%, perhaps making you feel stupid for not waiting a few more hours to get a 20% discount but this happens whether confirmation time is quick or very long.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:43:13

From $160 to $20k in 2 years is fucking impressive, much more impressive than the 2-year rut we were in after 2013 and I have personally lived through that bear market myself hodling.

Ethereum doesn't look good at all to me long term. IOTA on the other hand will easily blow all of the competition for micropayments out of the water if proven successful, nothing Bitcoin or any other blockchain based crypto can do about that. Bigger blocksizes are just a drop in the bucket and leads to more centralization, so I don't think it's wise for Bitcoin to focus its efforts on that. Bitcoin's strongest properties are its censorship resistance, security, immutability and digital gold aspects. Ethereum clearly lacks this, and IOTA has yet to proof itself in this regard (not sure whether this is even their goal, they seem to be focused on IoT and micropayments).

They can shake things up a bit, but it's not something Bitcoin couldn't adapt to and handle. As soon as those pools get attacked or attack the network themselves miners on that pool will take their business elsewhere.

Bitcoin would still be pretty safe and secure, don't see why that would change.

Increased adoption doesn't equate increased usage of Bitcoin in the sense of making lots of transactions. For example many use it as an exit to the fiat banking system, a store of value like gold independent from banks and governments. People don't generally buy gold to make transactions with it either.

You haven't answered the question, I know that Bitcoin currently has a hard 1MB limit. Does that mean that anything that proposes something else can never be Bitcoin and thus has to be an altcoin by definition? You just wrote yourself that this might change, but how does it ever change without introducing it as an altcoin according to your own definition? There needs to be wide consensus you say? Well then you need to explain why XT or some other proposed hard fork could never reach the necessary consensus. Or in other words how does it ever reach consensus if people like you automatically brand any proposed change as an altcoin? It sounds like framing to me and seems very dishonest. I'm not an XT advocate by any means (I think that station has long passed already, it's done), I just am concerned about censoring and framing of the discussion.

There's no chaotic panic going on, not on the individual level at least in a broad sense. People still have plenty of time to educate themselves or others about our financial system and BTC, not just the Greeks but the rest of the world as well because everyone is and will be affected by what's going on in Greece. Like the OP said, it's about public realization and a crisis like in Greece can make a lot of people more aware of what's going on and how your money might not be so safe in the bank as you first thought it was. If the whole world enters back into a financial crisis which is pretty much a given, we will see what's happening in Greece now all over the world. People who can ''organize and educate'' are absolutely needed now and during these times. The leaders will pretend to kick ass and pull triggers while others work in 'silence' on something that could actually be beneficial for our real future. Our leaders only think about the very short term and are unable to think outside the box to find real solutions to a systemic problem.

During a crisis such as this we humans have an opportunity to change things, to change the status quo that locks us in a position of debt slavery and dependency on centralized financial institutions. BTC will not solve all our problems overnight, but it can be a huge step in the right direction and thus the more people practice and try to understand and work with it now the closer we come to BTC becoming a workable alternative and solution.

The fundamental values of Bitcoin are decentralization and personal monetary sovereignty. You give that away by letting a central party control access to your coins, similar to a bank. We saw what happened when banks screwed up in 2008, do we really want to repeat our past mistakes especially if that means the working class will have to pay the cost of the banking elite's mistakes? If that's what you want sure that's your own personal choice, but when enough coins are in the hands of a few central parties like a Bitcoin ETF then what's really the point of Bitcoin in your opinion? How will it advance society and prevent us from repeating our mistakes from the past? Bitcoin could be a tool for personal freedom but it could just as well lead us back into tyranny and oppression if we let it, it's up to us to make sure that doesn't happen.

Now you're redefining your own conditions for what an altcoin is, you simply said that any time a new chain is introduced due to a change in the protocol for whatever reason an altcoin is created. This may be either a soft fork or a hard fork. Contentious means there is no wide consensus so both chains will be competing for dominance and this I agree is no healthy situation, nobody wants this. XT however was never meant to be implemented when there was not already a wide consensus present to use it, only the discussion about it was censored before we might even reach some kind of consensus about it.

And that's how it should be, allow people to feel the pain from their own mistakes and learn from them.
That said although MtGox was a painful lesson we had to learn, I don't think we should necessarily repeat it with a Bitcoin ETF.

SHA-256 or ASIC mining have little to do with this, Bitcoin Gold's network is vulnerable to these type of attacks due to how small it is. The reason why it's so small is because of its market value which is less than 1% of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has ASIC mining and SHA-256, but could also become vulnerable to this type of attack if it drops more in value, sitting right now between 13-14% of that of Bitcoin. Some really big miners mining on the Bitcoin network could quite easily perform such an attack on the Bitcoin Cash network if they wanted to, and this is probably going to happen at some point.

I bought at the top of the April 2013 bubble, and indeed living the dream now. Honing in on a small percentage of people who bought the top in December and then using that to make the point that Bitcoin is a bad investment is extremely myopic. You're not only ignoring what happened the years before but also the years to come. Bitcoin is not meant as a short term investment or get rich quick scheme, it's a (r)evolution in money and finance.

A few facts:
You are a long term trader
Bitcoin is 66% down from its ATH (all-time high)
As a long term trader you buy when the price is relatively low and hold for a long time until you sell when it's high. Right now the price is pretty damn low compared to the high, so if you sell now you might get lucky if it drops more for you to buy back in lower but as a long term trader it makes much more sense imo to buy now and wait however long it takes for the market to move higher again. You are a long term trader and I assume you are a long term bull right? So why sell now and pray it moves even lower? If we break structural support around $5700 it would make more sense to sell since that would signal we're in a longer term bear market.

It is possible theoretically, but since bitcoin is decentralized all participants need to agree on that change. Maybe not 100%, but you need wide consensus to change the fundamental rules of the protocol like the 21M limit. Bitcoin Cash is a result of part of the community wanting to change the rules, but since not everyone agreed on those changes they forked off from Bitcoin and created their own altcoin this way. If everyone had agreed with the changes everyone would have sold their Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash would have become the new Bitcoin with the new rules.

I think you have somewhat missed the point of Bitcoin. It doesn't save lives and bring people out of poverty because the Bitcoin price can only go up and up, but because it has the potential to fix the most corrupt elements of our current financial system which will reduce poverty significantly in the long run. It's about how Bitcoin can empower and free people because of how it works. Right now I agree it's still too risky to put all your wealth into, that's why those of us who can afford to take the risk have to be the ones to make sure Bitcoin gains the necessary momentum for it become a more stable and secure asset and develop its potential so third world countries and everyone else can benefit from it.

If Bitcoin Cash wanted to peacefully coexist with Bitcoin they should have changed their hashing algorithm and stop trying to leech off of the name and brand of Bitcoin with their petty propaganda games.  If they did I would be all for it and wish them the best, although I still wouldn't want to buy it because I personally do not share its vision of huge blocks and I believe it leads to centralization. It already is quite centralized looking at how easy they pull off hard forks without much consensus building.

Not really, Andreas just believes that 51% attacks are mostly theoretical because performing such an attack will be harmful to the attacker himself. In other words it's just not profitable for the attacker. I haven't seen any good argument by Peter Todd why this is not the case.

Well a sustained 51%+ share of the network would have this problem yes, but as soon as it comes to light that a pool abuses their power then it will pretty much be the end of that pool which resolves the problem you're talking about immediately.

Inflation is needed to keep the current debt based system afloat. That's it, there's no other reason. 0% inflation or deflation would very quickly make current debt levels unsustainable and it will collapse the financial system that is completely dependent on ever growing debt. Inflation is basically stealing from the future to benefit the present, and people thought this wouldn't be problematic because the future could do the same thing to their own future. It's the present cannibalizing their own future in a never-ending cycle of growth. This is our financial system in a nutshell. They thought they had invented some kind of economic perpetuum mobile with this model, but the reality is that there is no such thing and that the music has to stop at some point and then the price will have to be paid by that generation who refuses to continue to stack bigger and bigger burdens on the future for the sake of the present. We are that generation, at least I hope we are because this crazy system has to stop.

Sigh... a hard fork isn't clean and will take far more time to do than activating SegWit as a soft fork now. Getting tired of hearing and refuting this, your proposal is not realistic and if you're waiting for the community to come to a consensus to do what you want we will still be waiting and sitting at 1MB in 10 years from now. I wish SegWit was just a malleability fix and didn't increase the blocksize limit at all, it would have probably already been activated by now as a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:44:25


Not true. I have never had this problem and I'm making Bitcoin transactions quite regularly using a standard fee. So it's definitely not the new normal to wait 72+ hours for confirmations. Also LN will very significantly relieve fee pressure and increase transaction capacity by a lot so this problem you mention will not even be a problem for quite a while until blocks fill up again. And even then it's not really a problem at all.

You keep saying the same thing over and over and it's still wrong. There is a significant part of the Bitcoin community and some well known names and businesses who have declared their support for a hard fork to increase the block size limit to 2MB. This has everything to do with Bitcoin and can not be simplified and framed as some kind of altcoin takeover attempt. The 1MB limit is almost maxed out now and that's why there's lots of pressure to increase this limit to allow more users and transactions. I also think that we need to be patient and that following Core's roadmap is our best option, but it's wrong to try and silence people who disagree or brand them as devious altcoin projects with shady motivations. These people need a voice and within the context of Bitcoin and this subreddit, as they are as much a part of the bitcoin community as you and me are. Both sides have been accusing each other of having hidden agendas and this needs to stop. As Bitcoin Core wrote above: "Let's not disrupt healthy discussion and we should all do our best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise."

Of course he is, ''emergent consensus'' is perfectly safe because it sounds too cool not to be. Who needs to test these things anyway, we can just try it out and if it doesn't work we'll just migrate to some altcoin to try out something else that sounds cool.

Gavin is not talking about just a majority, but a supermajority (75% or more). It's also not just about what the miners will do, if the community itself is very much divided on the issue then the miners can fork what they want but the price of Bitcoin will drop very sharply as users sell their coins out of dissatisfaction with the miners' coup and change of the consensus rules. This is something Gavin totally ignored in his post.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:42:33
I have to agree with you. I would like to see a block size limit increase myself but it's not worth it to go through a contentious hard fork just to increase the limit from 1 to 2 MB. Better to stay united as a community even though we disagree on some things. We'll have to weather this storm together, Bitcoin is way too important to let it go down due to internal strife. Core is also working hard on fixing the technical issues regarding scaling and will deploy SegWit which is basically the same as increasing the limit. I know it's not ideal but we need to be patient and allow Bitcoin to grow and evolve without the horrible infighting. If push comes to shove and fees become ridiculously high the limit will be increased very quickly without all the fighting.

Let's not look at all the benefits of Segwit itself and just be guided by emotions of hate and revenge. Seriously?

Have you even read Core's roadmap at all? There is much more planned than SegWit, like CSV, weak blocks and IBLT. Which will all help pave the way for a block size limit increase. Just because they aren't able to pinpoint an exact date yet doesn't mean it's not in the plans. I really fail to understand why people can't understand this.

What contentious hard fork? People are just paranoid about a potential contentious hard fork, even though there is no such thing actually happening. There will be no hard fork unless there is broad consensus first, which means it won't be a contentious hard fork at all. The only way I could see a contentious hard fork happening is when fees have become unreasonably high to make a Bitcoin transaction and Core still refuses to raise the limit. I don't think it will get to that point before SegWit has been deployed and even if it does I'm pretty confident Core and the Bitcoin community will then be able to unite in an effort to raise the limit to allow more transactions. It would be foolish to do otherwise in such an emergency. At this point however we do not have such an emergency, so why get so high strung over this now? Just chill out a bit everything's fine and Classic is not going to come and fork us to hell.

Yes this is what I used to think as well. But is it really preferable in this case? I'm not an expert on technical matters and most of the technical experts agree that the limit should not be raised right now and that other solutions to scaling have priority. Although they don't have to be right necessarily, a hard fork when there is this kind of disagreement does not sound very wise to me. I want to see Bitcoin scale with the amount of users just as much as you do, and I'm sure most of the Core devs feel the exact same way. They just think that a hard fork now is too risky and shapes a bad precedent, and they may have a good point there. A hard fork should only happen when there is an overwhelming consensus, not when an angry reddit mob demands so. I also find it too risky to leave Core behind and step over to a new batch of devs who have little to no experience at all. So all these things considered, the preferable thing to do imo seems to wait for the actual problem to come up and then fix things quick and easy WITH overwhelming consensus. It is not certain that there will even be a problem before SegWit has been implemented fully. We don't know yet how the fee market will develop and how fast the fees will rise, so a hard fork might not even be needed any time soon. Let's wait and see. :)

So you're upset that Bitcoin is not fully developed and matured and can't support world wide use as a payment system right now. You need everything to work as it should at this very moment, and can't waste any time letting something properly grow and develop first. This is basically what you're saying here. You have been cheated by your own naive sense of reality.


This has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin not being viable as a payment system (first layer). I'm sure we will have 10MB blocks in 10 years if the community manages not to completely tear itself apart over trivial matters like this.

@_date: 2016-01-19 18:56:58
Is that really true? The Core devs have been quite busy on laying out a roadmap for scaling Bitcoin. They are not against a block size limit increase but right now priorities lie in paving the road for SegWit and other improvements that will make a future size limit increase much easier without sacrificing decentralization. It's a complex matter and there's no simple fix that can be deployed today. So I think users will have to be a little bit more patient, it will be rewarded in the end. Don't listen to alarmists like Mike Hearn, the sky isn't going to fall when blocks are full and fees will start to increase. Once this happens you'll see how fast the Core devs and the community will agree on how to fix this. When there is a real urgency a hard fork can happen really fast because everyone will understand what needs to be done. Making a fuss over it now just causes drama and strife (as we have witnessed) and hurts Bitcoin more.

SegWit may not work with the 95% threshold, but there are other ways to activate it. SegWit will happen, I'm pretty sure of that given its major support among the real businesses, wallets, users and Bitcoin experts. Only miners are lagging behind because of BU propaganda and misinformation.
@_date: 2016-01-26 12:56:49
No you are oversimplifying things here. Increasing the block size limit is not a real solution to Bitcoin scaling, it would just be a temporary band aid and is not without its own risks. Even Core realizes the block size limit probably needs a moderate increase sometime soon, but there are more important things to do and consider in order to create a real long term solution to Bitcoin scaling while keeping the network decentralized. The limit will be raised when there is a real urgency to do so. You might not want to wait for that, but it is what is needed to have the necessary consensus to do a hard fork safely without splitting the community.
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:11:22
Of course it works fine when only a small number of people actually use it as such. If that's okay with you, then Bitcoin is a perfectly fine working currency at a 1MB or 2MB limit, whatever your personal preference is. With increased adoption it will become harder of course, and with global adoption it's simply impossible to handle all transactions on-chain. Luckily Core has a nice roadmap that will allow increased adoption for the coming years, but many people are just too impatient or think everything is falling apart when you need to pay a $0.05 fee to get a timely transaction through.
@_date: 2016-03-07 11:58:58
Okay so how do you propose Bitcoin could be used as a world wide currency without using 2nd layers like Lightning? Not by increasing the blocksize, that's for sure. I'm interested to hear your solution to this. If you can't come up with one then you have no choice but to agree with me that Bitcoin can not be viable as a payment system without 2nd layer solutions. I'm not sure what your problem is with that though.

@_date: 2017-03-17 14:08:06
Sigh... SegWit is PART of a scaling solution. SegWit already bumps up the blocksize limit to 2MB with a soft fork and can be activated right now. Your proposal requires a hard fork and is much harder to do now. Activate segwit first, then let's discuss a hard fork and see if we can get consensus for that. Everyone wins.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:13:40
Not sure who exactly is involved but you can be sure there are parties out there fanning the flames of discontent within the community to blow it further apart. It's funny because the community is divided over Bitcoin being able to handle either 5 transactions per second or 10 per second, which is like a drop in the ocean. Second layer solutions will truly allow Bitcoin to scale, and when that happens the State and some other parties have everything to lose. So yeah stopping it now while second layer solutions have not been properly developed yet is of great importance to those who would not like to see this future happen at all.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:57:52
Anyone can change it, but it only will be an effective change if miners, full nodes, exchanges and Bitcoin businesses all upgrade their software to the proposed changed version. So there needs to be a broad consensus about it, and not just miners deciding.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:01:12
In this case it is probably better to do just that. It will be very easy to get consensus once fees become unreasonably high and then a hard fork can be rolled out in no time. The current mess we're in just isn't worth it, even though I'd like to see it done earlier as well. The division this causes in the community is much more damaging than if we postpone the fork until the block size limit actually becomes a problem. It is what it is.

I am fine with the current consensus system, which does NOT emerge through mining. At least not yet, emergent consensus through mining is an invention of BU and is the worst idea ever. You will find out the power of the market once a majority of hashrate tries to push for a contentious hard fork with BU. Should be fun. :)

@_date: 2016-03-07 18:15:30
Bitcoin is what it is, only a hard fork can change Bitcoin on a fundamental level. Bitcoin can be both a payment system and settlement layer, but for the first we need second layer solutions not increased block sizes. This is not something that is disputed, an increased block size limit will not magically turn Bitcoin into a payment system that is able to handle thousands of transactions per second. That will not happen unless you make Bitcoin so centralized that it's just an inferior version of Visa and Mastercard. You can't just bloat the blockchain with billions of transactions for coffee and beer.
So there is no ''Core view'' of what Bitcoin should be, it simply is what it is. Now increasing the block size limit is still needed and going to happen eventually, but not tomorrow and this will certainly not make Bitcoin a 'currency'. I also see no problem with this.

I think he just doesn't understand what economic majority means. His full statement reads: "I don't think economic majority is that important. I started to invest into Bitcoin in 2011 by ignoring so called "majority"."
So in his mind he ignored what the majority said in 2011 who called him stupid for investing in Bitcoin, and he turned out to be right. So now from his perspective he is again ignoring the majority who is telling him BU is bad and contentious hard fork is bad, and he believes he again is right by ignorating that majority. I don't think he sees the difference and is unable to self-reflect critically. It's not a conspiracy just human psychology and too much ego.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:17:26


God... it took you this long to find out that increasing the block size has always been known to be only a short term fix? Most of us knew this already two years ago. Long term scaling strategy is Lightning.
@_date: 2016-01-31 02:07:15
The main reason is that a higher limit will increase mining centralization, which is a huge issue right now. They are trying to mitigate this problem through developing things like weak blocks and thus pave the way for raising the limit. A fee market isn't necessary now, and SegWit will also help to keep fees low for a while.
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:34:08
I used to agree with him about the blocksize as well, but ever since Hearn made such a fool of himself by doing what he did I've actually started to review that opinion. Not that I think the blocksize should forever stay at 1MB now, but the alarmist and populist attitude that Hearn adopted and his push for a hard fork I now no longer can agree with. I think Core's roadmap for Bitcoin scaling is fine for now, and if fees rise to a point that it becomes a real problem a hard fork to raise the limit will be much easier and faster to deploy without all the drama. I've become much more relaxed about the block size issue now, all thanks to Hearn's temper tantrum. :p
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:05:06
That's completely disconnected from reality. You're only going to make things much worse by censoring an open discussion about hard fork proposals and treating them like altcoins that should be ignored, especially considering a large part of the Bitcoin community wants it. It causes bad blood and a divide in the community, just like we've seen lately. You want to stop these things from destroying Bitcoin? Then you need to stop censoring discussion about hard forks and alternatives to Core. You can see that things are already improving now that the censorship has pretty much stopped in here and we're allowed to discuss these things freely.

No the community is blocking a hard fork, there is no consensus for a hard fork right now. There is pretty good community support for fixing the issue with a soft fork though, but that's being blocked by BU tards and miners who listen to their propaganda.
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:38:30


No it hasn't. I observed the ETC/ETH split very closely and it was pretty obvious hashrate was following the market there. I don't understand why you'd even want to debate this. I think the market has spoken by now and clearly values ETH over ETC, but this is not too surprising given the huge monetary incentive for people to support the ETH fork to bail themselves out. I am very curious to see how the market will judge the position and behavior of the miners in Bitcoin as well as their trust in the BU dev team versus the Core team. The market will be very unforgiving though if you're caught on the wrong side of the fork, especially for the miners.
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:53:31
Adam is right actually, majority rule is not something you want to see. This is why direct democracy fails. The Bitcoin protocol development should never be at the whim of what the majority thinks and wants, they lack the expertise needed and miss lots of very important nuances. Also public opinion tends to be easily swayed by propaganda and is more susceptible to emotional appeals rather than rational and logical arguments. Bitcoin should never become a political tool, hard forks to change the protocol require consensus across the board and not whatever a majority today feels is right.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:08:42


Wrong. It's the other way around. Hashrate follows price.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:07:46
Who is going to keep using legacy transactions when they can do SegWit transactions and pay a lower fee? All the good wallets will surely update and be SegWit ready. Sure some people will not update and their transactions stay vulnerable to malleability, but why should we care about that when we all have the freedom of choice to use SegWit transactions? A hard fork will remove that choice entirely but comes with many other problems and risks of its own. So in my opinion a soft fork is a better, more reliable, safer and faster option (because hard forks are really hard).
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:44:57
Bitcoin works fine? Where did you get the strange idea that it doesn't work?
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:35:55


That's because SegWit is one of many steps needed to eventually allow real scaling solutions to flourish, and also to make a future hard fork to a higher blocksize limit safer to do. It was never proposed as THE scaling solution, that's just lazy simplification on your side. It fixes several issues, paves the way for future scaling and also gives a decent bump to the blocksize. What the fuck are we waiting for? Stop the stupid politics and activate SegWit already.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:08:55
Absolutely wrong. The miners do not live in a vacuum, if 100% of the miners decide to fork without great support of the wider Bitcoin economy then the value of the coin will tank so miners will be mining a worthless coin. And miners also need support from full nodes. Also a PoW change will be likely to happen to cut the powerhungry miners off from the Bitcoin blockchain. So you see the miners do not have the power at all here.

Theoretically there can be two separate networks after such a fork.. but I wouldn't bet on it and it's just as well possible that both chains will collapse due to loss of confidence and damage to Bitcoin's reputation. I don't think miners, businesses and users would like to risk such a thing. This is why hard forks require consensus, nobody who is invested in this wants a contentious hard fork and see where it leads.

Ethereum isn't approaching Bitcoin's market cap by a long shot, even Litecoin was higher at its prime. And Ethereum as a token also serves a very different purpose than Bitcoin does.
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:19:19
I was under the impression that there was pretty much consensus that a 2MB cap would not cause any real problems. But I guess this is under the assumption that some other things will be implemented first. Anyway I agree that there's no consensus right now about increasing the block size limit, and I don't believe a serious hard fork will be attempted under these circumstances. Miners don't want to play it dangerous and will follow only if a consensus has been reached.
@_date: 2016-01-23 11:07:26
You and many others here are mistaking support for preference. Antonopoulos is also supporting Litecoin, does that mean he favors Litecoin over Bitcoin or even owns any Litecoin at all? No it doesn't, he may even think Litecoin is total crap but he supports its existence because he understands the importance of competition. You also contradict yourself, you say that the idea of competing implementations is wrong but at the end acknowledge that maybe in a year Classic might be able to compete with Core and take the lead?
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:27:49
Miners will not mine a worthless coin, they'll switch to whichever coin is valued most by the market. Hashrate follows price not the other way around. This is what was also seen after the ETH/ETC split. When ETC came closer in price to ETH you saw ETC hashrate go up, and when the gap in price between the two widened again ETC hashrate also went down.

I don't think people are really divided over SegWit, it was only turned into a political issue and drawn into the whole blocksize issue by the BU side. Hopefully this can now stop and people come to their senses and stand behind activating SegWit as soon as possible.

If Bitcoin ever splits it will be very confusing for the public and I will probably pack my bags and go away.

@_date: 2017-03-07 12:59:28
It's not being promoted by any Core dev yet, this means not enough research has been done to say a 'safe' UASF is possible right now. The entire idea of UASF is barely a week old, give it some time for the serious devs to study it and see whether this can be done in a safe way.

This is a fair point. However, how would you address the argument that there are always people who don't care if blocks are always full and fees are very high? In that case a hard fork will never be entirely uncontroversial, and the can will be kicked down the road forever until Bitcoin has become too expensive to use for most people. Don't you think this a genuine concern? The veto of a small minority who feel Bitcoin is something different than what most of us want it to be?
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:55:55
This change would be opt-in, it forces nobody to do segwit transactions or mine them. Users who want to benefit from doing segwit transactions can do so, and those who don't simply don't. If you don't like this change then don't upgrade and use it? This is very different form a hardfork that forces everyone to upgrade and is backwards incompatible.

I think TimoY is just a little bit too paranoid and cautious. For a normal person a hardware wallet is more than safe enough.

I would prefer  slower blocks for a while, because I think it's unfair to punish the miners who have been supporting us all this time.

Personally I would love the idea of being able to mine again using my own GPU farm, but all things considered this should be a method of last resort in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:09:36


No he is wrong, you can't scale onchain to the point of mass adoption without sacrificing the health of the system. Mass adoption is impossible without 2nd layer solutions. 1MB, 2MB, or 4MB blocksize will not make a big difference here. SegWit gives us 2MB and is the safest and quickest option to relieve fee pressure before LN is ready. I find it ironic how Roger is partly responsible for blocking SegWit and therefore blocking growth and lower fees himself.
I agree though that character assassinations do not belong here. We should discuss the actual arguments not the person.
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:14:13
You can also say that the government represents the people, but we all know that lots of people do not feel represented by their government at all. I think the problem here is that it's hard to measure economic supermajority, while it's easy to measure miner supermajority. But a miner supermajority does not guarantee that most people will happily go along with them at all, so that's why I think Classic and their 75% activation threshold is a dangerous thing. I'm in favor of a 2MB hard fork (in 2016 or 2017), but not the way this has been set up with a supermajority of miners as it carries a huge risk of splitting the entire Bitcoin economy. We can indeed only hope that the miners will listen to our concerns...

You don't buy it, okay fine that's your opinion. People with way more technical expertise than you disagree however. If only the big pools can run nodes it will be very bad for decentralization. I will side with the technical experts on this argument. I can respect your opinion though, but clearly there is no consensus here so I think it's better to accept that fact and follow Core's roadmap and stop the bickering.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:14:13
Hashrate follows price and economic majority not the other way around. Having a majority hashrate before the split doesn't matter because it doesn't affect anything yet, BU coin doesn't exist yet. Only after the split the ball is up to the Bitcoin economy and if they want to stick to Core then hashrate will follow their preference. I would not recommend we go this route as it will be very damaging, but if we have to learn this painful lesson so be it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:27:11
You have no clue what you're talking about. The 100+ Core devs have done an amazing job getting Bitcoin to where it is today. Core is also not a single entity, they are a diverse group of talented coders with various opinions and ideas on many things. They don't and can't speak with one mouth, and you can't paint them with a single brush. As for them not understanding economics, well to be honest I think nobody understands economics and is qualified as an expert to tell us what's best for the economy as a whole. Look at the real world and see how the economic 'experts' are doing. I will trust math and the immutability of the consensus protocol over economic experts telling us what's best for us.

You can't leave bitcoin out of it when talking about a proposed bitcoin hard fork that has a lot of community support behind it. You can't just ignore a large part of the community and act like they don't exist, it will backfire in a very unpleasant way. Good thing moderators here have started to understand this and oppressive voices like yours are becoming a small minority.

No it's not, the child's parents may provide a good datapoint for its future height but we do not have a similar datapoint for bitcoin's future volatility after it's all grown up. We do know that volatility has been going down on average as the liquidity increases so the current volatility surely can not be one of the reasons to write off bitcoin right now.

What exactly is wrong with SegWit? I heard miners don't like SegWit because they think it will expedite the development of LN and they see LN as competition. That entire argument is just false and I don't see how you can compromise based on the false notion that LN will somehow eat the miners' lunch. Also who do you compromise with? Who represents Core? Who represents the miners? And why are the users and holders left out? Doesn't this go against the entire notion of decentralization? I don't see this working.

There is no LACK of progress and change, you are just blinded by looking at only one thing. Core's roadmap actually incorporates a block limit increase but not before SegWit and some other improvements have been made first. I think they have a much more healthy plan for the long term, and their plan also has technical consensus. The idea to increase the limit now has no consensus at all and miners would be foolish to force a contentious hard fork at this point, when SegWit will achieve pretty much the same thing soon without any hard fork drama. Why don't you stop looking only at the very short term and start seeing the bigger picture here? I used to be a big fan of bigger blocks but after reading and weighing the opinions from all sides I now see how I saw things a bit one-sided. Start reading and understanding the arguments from those who see things from Core's point of view, don't assume ill faith and come up with conspiracy theories just listen to what they're actually saying. They are raising some very good points you know.

Well, only the market can tell us for sure, but most businesses and people with actual stake in BTC seem to be against BU if you look around a bit and gauge their opinions. Just my own observation though watching from a distance. I'm not really against BU per say, but I am against their careless and irresponsible approach towards a hard fork. If BU would have taken measures to assure that their fork would never activate without wide consensus among the entire community, then I would applaud their efforts (although I'd still support Core since I think emergent consensus is not safe).

Let's not compare Bitcoin to the abomination that is called the US election. Core = 100+ different developers of which only a select few are employed by Blockstream. They just write, test and review code, which they have done for many years now and they are considered the very best in the cryptofield. They do not control Bitcoin as some people mistakenly think. Miners also do not control Bitcoin. Nobody does, this is why it's called decentralized. BU = a small team of coders who want to turn Bitcoin into some kind of democracy where miners control Bitcoin. Their code also seems to lack peer review and proper testing. Pretty dangerous if you ask me.

Only problem I have with Hal Finney's message is this part: "Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today."
This prediction may be outdated now but it goes against why many of us are in Bitcoin, so I'm not sure why he wrote this. We want Bitcoin to be a censorship resistant money for and by the people. We want to be our own banks, not be their slaves. Bitcoin is all about financial freedom. I do still believe SegWit, Lightning and other technical innovations in Bitcoin will get us there eventually.

You still got it the wrong way. Buyers will simply buy coins from whichever chain they value most, they don't first look at which coin has the most hashrate and then decide to buy that coin for that reason. Nobody actually does that. Miners will look at the value of the coin and point their rigs at whichever coin gives them the most profit. Block rewards are more important than tx fees for miners, at least for a few more years.

Miners can not unilaterally decide what's the consensus, they just can't. Consensus doesn't just change because 75% of miners decide to build a chain they prefer, and then think they can split and kill the minority chain without any repercussions. First of all they need the support of enough independent full nodes to verify and validate their work, and they also need the support of the entire community and economy. If miners collude and misbehave in a way the Bitcoin economy doesn't like they will simply reject the entire miners' chain. In other words the coins the miners mine from finding blocks on their particular chain will become worthless because the community rejects them. The market will decide if push comes to shove.

I don't think you fully understand how mining works. In this case the difficulty to mine BTC and BTU is exactly the same since the split has just happened and difficulty didn't adjust yet for both coins. Mining BTC in your example with the same hashpower will earn you more money than mining BTU since the block reward is higher (12.5x$400 vs 12.5x$300). Difficulty is the same so miners will flock to mining BTC in your example until difficulty adjusts and a new equilibrium is found based on the market value of each coin. It's easy to see in this example how the miners are not in control at all and the market decides which of the two coins becomes the dominant chain.

It is SegWit but transactions take up less space with bech32 so it is better for the network as a whole if we use bech32. If everybody is just satisfied with P2SH that is pure laziness, we need to pressure exchanges to support bech32 and not settle for less.

Thanks for calling me an idiot, ad hominem attacks will surely improve the current debate... I'm supporting Classic and hope they can show us they can compete with Core's experience and expertise, but I also think Core is the best way forward for now. I don't understand your hostility, apparently you are very afraid Classic will be able to overtake Core without a broad consensus. It's never that easy, they will have to work very very hard to show that they can handle the future code of Bitcoin better than Core does. People panic way too easily around here, Classic is very far away from taking over Core's job. And if they do in the future, they probably deserve it. This is healthy competition, without the hostility and insults thrown around which is totally unnecessary. Let me restate that right now in my opinion Core is the way forward and it's not going to be overtaken any time soon.

Problem is you can't force a HF, pretty much everyone needs to agree. SegWit is much easier to do as we've done many successful soft forks before. So while you, me and Core may all want a HF, it takes time to agree on the how, the when, and how much. It needs careful planning and testing, and threats, pressuring, insults or blackmailing do not help at all. This whole situation does NOT help and will only serve to push a non-contentious HF further away. Give the Core team some space and room, help to activate SegWit first and clear all the stress and tension in the air so we can come together to do a HF later. We all carry a responsibility here.

You're so obviously a Bcash shill disguising himself as a Bitcoin Core supporter in the hopes of being taken somewhat seriously. Bitcoin Core supporter sounds quite silly by the way, I'd call myself simply a Bitcoin supporter (which is only BTC). Segwit was a soft fork and backwards compatible with non-segwit wallets and other older software, that's why still around 50% of Bitcoin transactions are from non-segwit addresses. BCH is a fake copycat owned by Bitmain and Roger Ver (and Faketoshi trying to wedge himself in as a leader too lol), completely centralized garbage and technologically inferior as well.

No he didn't say that, you are clearly twisting his words. He said that in his opinion Core should follow and adopt 2MB if push came to shove and Classic's attempt to hard fork succeeded. He would have kept working on the Core team though after such a (in his opinion very dangerous) fork. He said this because he did not want to risk the entire project by splitting Bitcoin in two because of this issue. He does not support Classic's methods at all, and clearly did not want it to succeed. Luckily it didn't.

Not necessarily, starting with 3 means it's a P2SH (pay to script hash) address. This can be a segwit address, but could also be a non-segwit multi-signature address for example. Addresses starting with bc1 are real native segwit addresses, and indeed transactions from these addresses take up less space which means more transactions of this type would fit into a block and it would also mean you pay a smaller fee on average.

Using your common sense and logic, what do you think will happen when an asset gets an upgrade that will allow more transactions per second and solve several other problems at the same time? You can't prove it will become more valuable, but it's pretty damn likely it will.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:32:52
Nothing has intrinsic value, it's always people who ascribe value to something based on the useful properties it has and its scarcity. Gold for instance is scarce and it's pretty durable, so that makes it useful as money for a lot of people and thus it is valued pretty highly on the market. Bitcoin is also scarce and durable, and has even more useful properties as money like being easy to store and move around, so I think it's ideal as money and imo it will only take time for the human population to properly recognize its value as such.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:43:55


No, miners exploiting EDA can draw more miners in to mine their chain because they have faster block times and in time can become the most worked chain (for a while) even though its market cap is way lower than the original chain. Most worked chain alone is therefore not a good definition.
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:02:10


No we don't, and we've also moved past that station now. We will never have always spare block space available even if we increase the block size limit to 100 MB. Bitcoin has matured to a point now that as soon as transactions are free someone is going to fill up the cheap space available, even if it's just spam.

We can talk about hard forks later.
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:10:38
Your math is sound, however psychology is much more important than math here. Lower inflation will not only reduce new supply, but also increase demand at the same time as buying coins with this now lower inflation percentage will become more desirable in the eyes of people. Especially once BTC inflation becomes lower than the average inflation of main currencies like EUR, USD I would expect the demand to really start picking up fast. I'm guessing the halving from 3% to 1.5% to have the greatest psychological effect on demand and thus the price in 8 years from now. Nothing is certain though, but if BTC remains successful and its technical hurdles can be overcome than this is a very likely scenario.

There might be a financial incentive for them to mine empty blocks too, since they can drive up the fees this way first and later collect them by including the transactions with high fees into their blocks. And at the same time they can also try to drive more people towards BCH which they own a very large stake in.
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:38:40
Yes they do, so as an individual miner it would make financial sense to move from Antpool to another pool that are mining full blocks. This should in the longer run make Antpool lose money due to miners leaving them. Unless the benefit of using Asicboost on empty blocks is larger than the benefit of mining full blocks including fees.

Not really. Some people have a lot of charisma (and money) and can convince a lot of people their ideology is the right one, this also means they have more influence than people like you and me. Most people don't know enough about how Bitcoin works so if someone who seems knowledgeable tells them that we should increase the blocksize so more users can make Bitcoin transactions this will sound like a great idea to them and they will likely support it. Unless someone else who also seems knowledgeable objects to that idea and gives good arguments for it. Appeals to authority can not be avoided sadly, as not everyone can be an expert in the technical and economic workings of Bitcoin. This is not a problem as long as we have a nice distributed number of these charismatic 'experts', so when a large majority of them agree the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem will likely follow. Regarding the blocksize we still see a lot of disagreement, but regarding Segwit we've seen a lot more agreement where influential people like Gavin, Armstrong and Antonopoulos all have spoken out in support of Segwit. Except Roger Ver and others who are holding on to their grudge against Core and therefore are blocking all progress that can be made. :(
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:09:08
Experts can be wrong yes, that's why you need many of them not just a handful.

How do you see regular people making decisions about things they don't understand without relying on an expert on the matter? It doesn't work.

Devs are not here to play politics, they deliver code. Core devs couldn't care less if miners refuse to run Segwit because they want to play politics and bargain for more. The perfect solution that everyone will be happy with doesn't exist, you need to leave politics at the door and take a pragmatic approach which would be accepting Segwit right now. Miners who block Segwit for political leverage need to understand that Core devs don't care whether they decide to run Segwit or not, they are happy with a 1MB limit like we have now. Core can't force through a hard fork anyway even if they wanted to, they don't have that power. Only the users and businesses who use Bitcoin a lot to make transactions will be unhappy here, and they clearly are saying they want Segwit or anything that will decrease fee pressure. Personally I don't mind really as I rarely make onchain Bitcoin transaction, I'm happy with Bitcoin just as a store of value outside of the banking system. That said I still support Segwit and think it would be very beneficial for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-01-30 11:51:51

Well BU thinks that the max blocksize is not part of the consensus rules, because it was only added as a way to stop spam attacks. It doesn't matter why it was added initially though, the fact is that it is part of the consensus rules now and also needs consensus to change it. It's called a hard fork and we don't take this measure very lightly. Segwit is a roundabout way to increase the effective blocksize limit through a soft fork and this is I think our best option right now.

Bcash blockchain is severely hampered by miners gaming the difficulty through EDA, causing much higher inflation and alternating periods of no blocks for several hours and periods of blocks created every single minute. You need to be a religious fanatic to not see how this is a bad thing for their network.

No this is not how Bitcoin works, Bitcoin is not a network that consists of only Miners. Miners can decide what they mine, but they are not dictators that get to set the rules for the rest of us. If the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem does not agree with what miners are doing the miners risk losing their income.

Oh please you're regurgitating the same bogus narrative from the MSM that every critical independent researcher already knows is clearly false. Russia didn't meddle in western elections or at least there's no actual proof they did, it's just more paranoia feeding Russiophobia. I tend to believe Assange and Wikileaks over the CIA, sorry. Ukraine is a complicated matter I will not delve deep into now, suffice to say is that imo Russia had the right to protect its own interests and their citizens. You can disagree, but I'm sure the US or any country would have done the same thing in their shoes. And Assad... well there's no proof he used chemical weapons on his own civilians. Again all made-up stories at an attempt to overthrow governments the US doesn't like. Like they did in Iraq and Libya. It's the US who is constantly coming up with lies and false narratives to sabotage all attempts to improve relations between Russia and the US. Obama probably doesn't even realize this himself as he is also just being fed the same false information. Trump luckily is not so naive though, even though I disagree with him on many other matters. Still prefer him easily over someone like Clinton.

First wallets will have to allow you to create segwit addresses, and then people will have to start using them in order to get the fee discount. Patience.

And they do this by gaming the difficulty and thereby artificially increasing coin inflation on their chain. Who will trust such a chain? A chain where miners can game the system and its inexperienced developers don't mind to sacrifice decentralization for the sake of more transaction throughput. I don't think this is what people want but I'll just let the market do the talking. Pure hashrate does not give a coin its value, the free market will have the final say here.

News was always bad, but back then you had no other sources of information to question its validity as the news was heavily centralized. Social media may not seem to improve the situation but with proper discernment and good research you can nowadays get much closer to the truth. You just need to learn how to navigate the maze of information, some are good at it and some really bad (ie. flat earthers).

Segwit solves the malleability problem, quadratic hashing, increases the max blocksize, and also paves the way for more future scaling. If I was a miner I'd run that shit knowing that it will very likely increase the value of my mined coins so I can get more profit. I can't think of any good reason why miners wouldn't run Segwit unless they are grossly misinformed about what Segwit does, or they want to voice their dissatisfaction with Core this way because they think they promised them code for a hard fork alongside Segwit.

Two friends of mine were curious and asked me to explain them more about Bitcoin during the past week. One of them invested $400 now with my help and the other said he is interested in buying but wants to wait until he has put some money aside.

Unlucky timing I guess, sometimes blocks are found less often and you end up having to wait a couple hours. 3-4h for 3 confirmations would be fine for me though, if you need confirmations faster when you're in a hurry then simply increase your fee or look what kind of transactions are included in the latest blocks to make a better estimation of the fee needed.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:16:44
This is definitely not the way to convince people to support Segwit. I'm all for Segwit but it has to be a voluntary thing and not forced like this. I also genuinely believe this wouldn't work as it will only cause more division and strife within the community.
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:07:50
The main problem is not storage capacity, although even that will become a problem very fast if blocks grow too big. With 100MB blocks you can only do 300 transactions per second and that would already grow the blockchain by 5TB each year. 50TB per year if you want to scale to VISA level. Not many users will be able to or want to download and store that amount of data. And then you forget about bandwith costs which is a bigger problem.
@_date: 2017-01-19 18:17:00

You ignore the other big similarity, that you can mine Bitcoin just like Gold. And that those who own Gold have similar views about fiat and money than those who hold Bitcoin. That you believe one is much better than the other don't make the obvious similarities disappear. Bitcoin is often compared to gold and cash, digital gold (or digital cash) sounds catchy and makes it easier to explain to people when you talk about its scarcity and Bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:19:35
It does make sense, you just failed to understand my comment. My point is that blockchain in and of itself is not very useful when attempting to decouple it from Bitcoin and use it for other purposes. It's about Bitcoin not the blockchain, that's where the real innovation is at. Blockchain is just an overhyped buzzterm for people who do not understand that it is Bitcoin that makes having a blockchain actually useful. But hey believe what you want, it's good we can all put our money where our mouth is and see the results eventually. :)

The price is most certainly going to drop pretty hard eventually if miners keep blocking Segwit and other cryptocoins are capable of making progress while Bitcoin is stalling. Bitcoin users are pretty patient but there comes a point where they will give up waiting for the miners to adopt Segwit and start selling their coins.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:39:21

@_date: 2017-01-04 11:56:00
The comparison is obvious. Bitcoin can be mined just like gold, it has a limited supply just like gold and it's also seen as a form of money. The main difference is that Bitcoin is digital, so that's why people call it digital gold. Being digital it has some advantages over physical gold, which you named here.

You mean Bitcoin users right? Bitpay is not Bitcoin. And no, if for example 51% users want to change the consensus rules and hard fork to bigger blocks in November and 49% are against it then that would by definition be a contentious hard fork and according to Stephen Pair and many others this should not happen. Wide consensus is needed for a hard fork to be smooth and minimize the risk of a persistent chain split, and also code needs to be properly tested and everyone needs enough time to update their software which takes more time than just 3 months.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:47:21


You can keep making your coffee transactions on the base protocol if you want, but you would simply pay a much lower fee if you use a 2nd layer for that. Personally I will use 2nd layer for small transactions in the future and use the base protocol layer if I need to move a large amount of money. I don't see the problem you seem to be having with this idea, Bitcoin absolutely needs a 2nd layer like lightning to be able to handle global adoption and that's fine.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:05:54


The valid chain should be the chain with the most work AND highest market cap, as it's possible to have the most work with a lower market cap due to miners exploiting EDA to produce faster blocks on average. And even then that is subject to change, so with these requirements you can never truly determine the real Bitcoin chain as the other chain may overtake the current leading chain again in the future. So imo this is not a good definition of Bitcoin either. 


If there is consensus to do a hard fork then the legacy chain would cease to exist immediately after the fork and thus no authority required to determine the real Bitcoin. This is still the best definition imo.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:10:17
Well they don't think a block size increase is very important at least. Segwit is more than just an increase of course but its adoption is not crucial to Core devs themselves. It's up to the community to adopt it and reap the benefits. I was talking about the miners who block Segwit for political reasons, but they're only hurting themselves with this and not Core.

Hidden wallets are wallets with a passphrase, which is basically the 25th word of the 24-word recovery seed of your Trezor. So you have your regular 24 words you got from your Trezor, and then you can create hidden wallets by using passphrases on top of the 24 word seed. For every passphrase you create a new hidden wallet you can use with your Trezor.

He is right though, it is easiest to just buy and hold. Most people who try to daytrade will lose money in the long term. This time you were lucky to sell right before a drop, next time you may not be so lucky and price will run away and not come back down to the price you sold at. It's so easy to think you're a genius when you sell right before a big drop, I've been there done that too and after almost 4 years in Bitcoin I would have been way better off if I had just held my coins the whole time. But who knows, maybe you are actually one of the few who outperforms buy and hold strategy for Bitcoin. Good for you in that case.

The reward miners are getting from fees right now are minimal compared to the block reward, miners will barely notice the difference if fees are lower for a while. I don't think miners are concerned at all about this, they want Bitcoin development to progress as much as anyone else so SegWit is an important step in this regard. There is a small minority who want to block SegWit because they carry a grudge with Core. Childish perhaps, but a small percentage of people are like that. I am optimistic SegWit will get activated with or without them.

Fake news didn't get Trump elected, that's just made up bullshit by the sore losers who voted for Hillary and are looking for excuses. Just like the 'Russian hackers' who supposedly influenced the elections. That's the fake news here. The wrong analysis about bitcoin in the washington post can't even be called analysis, it's just wishful thinking from someone who hates Bitcoin for some reason. That's also fake news, as it's being portrayed as news while it's just an extremely biased opinion from an ignorant person at best or malicious actor at worst. Most of their so called journalism are of this type so the washington post is a nice example of a fake news source. Hillary being involved in a child porn ring is not news but speculation based on some suspicious e-mails. Although I do agree the e-mails are strange and suspicious I personally haven't seen enough evidence for her being involved in child trafficking. There is plenty of evidence about Hillary being involved in other shady stuff though and that's ultimately why she wasn't elected, rightfully so imo.

And all that work will quickly be for nothing when Bitcoin adapts and switches to a different PoW algorithm that will be even more resistant to such an attack. No way this is even remotely an effective way to shutdown Bitcoin.

Not true. Most people I talk to about Bitcoin never bring up 'cultists' or anything like that being the reason they haven't bought it yet. It's just that they're not technical, they're afraid of being hacked and they sometimes also bring up that it feels kind of shady because of the association with drugs and the darkweb. Never heard anything about a fantasy political agenda that its fans love that puts them off Bitcoin, so I think that's just a part of your own fantasy. Usually people I talk to like the idea of Bitcoin not being attached to banks and it being peer-to-peer, but they're afraid to hop onboard because of their own technical limitations. And that's fine with me if that stays for a few more years, Bitcoin isn't ready for global adoption yet.

There is no proof whatsoever of what you're saying. The examples we have of economies with deflationary currencies do not support your statement.

You're the idiot thinking inflationary currency produces a sustainable and better economy. A brainwashed idiot that is. Read the Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous and then come back to me telling me the same nonsense you just said without breaking into laughter.
The rich are getting richer much faster with an inflationary currency as they have an overflow of currency coming in which they can immediately use to buy up assets that increase in value compared to their currency. The gap between rich and poor widens with an inflationary currency, while a deflationary currency will allow the poor to save and improve their position more easily. They become less dependent on debt to sustain themselves.
Anyway good luck with your wonderful inflationary currency while I keep saving my money in a deflationary currency and there's nothing you can do about it. :)

Ah I see, it's what you have been taught in today's economics school. I've also studied economics, but after reading up on an alternative school of economic thought called the Austrian school, which you're probably familiar with as well, I have come to look with very different eyes with what is generally accepted as true today. It's not like I haven't tried to see it from the Keynesian point of view, actually I used to assume that it was probably the correct view, but I can't anymore and I truly believe what we're being taught today in school about economics is wrong. It's not an exact science. I really would recommend you read up on Austrian economics with an open mind, the Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous explains it very well in my opinion and it also contains plenty of references for you to dig more into if you're interested.  
Well, for now I guess we can only agree to disagree on this, I don't blame you for believing the mainstream accepted view but I hope your mind is open enough to question at least some of what you've been taught. The rabbit hole is real once you dive into this, that's all I can say.

It is definitely in their self interest to signal for Segwit. Sure, short term transaction fees will go down, but the Bitcoin price will likely increase and with more transactions per block that means that even with lower fees per transaction the total fee reward per block could be higher than it is now. Also it will attract more users and more users is obviously good for Bitcoin and its miners in the long run.

I think it would be well worth it, society and the market will adapt to the new situation. But I don't expect bitcoin to replace the legacy system any time soon, it will become an increasingly popular way for people to escape the coming negative interest rates on their savings and it will provide a hedge against inflation similar to gold. Eventually I do expect the legacy system to be replaced once it is obvious that the old way has become obsolete and the central bank experiment has failed. There will be no deflationary spiral, a new market equilibrium will be found and probably a lot of the old debt will have to be written off and forgiven.

Updating your personal node isn't very hard if that's all you want and need. But mining pools and big mining businesses need to do a little bit more than just that in order to signal support, F2Pool for example explained that they're having technical difficulties and can't signal support for SegWit at this time. They said their current system can't build C++11 and need to install new servers first. Anyway so far the fact is that SegWit support is growing faster than earlier soft forks that were successful, so to say that adoption is too slow is just factually incorrect considering the data we have.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:57:34
Debt doesn't actually grow an economy, it causes bubbles which is a fake form of growth. There's a reason it's called debt, it has to be paid back with interest. Economies grow when actual production grows due to technological innovations which are driven by capital investments. With a deflationary currency people are more likely to postpone consumption and save money, which they can later use to invest into something that will help grow the actual economy. Not saying that debt is bad, borrowing can be very useful for an economy but only if this happens within the context of a free market economy with a sound monetary unit. Not an inflationary currency that can be printed at will which completely distorts normal market forces.
@_date: 2016-11-27 03:55:23
You are twisting and turning, you said SegWit adoption was going slow while the fact is that it's going very fast compared to earlier soft forks. The last soft fork wasn't even all that long ago, things weren't much different then. SegWit is seen as a huge improvement by pretty much the entire ecosystem, the only ones who are against it and make it seem like it's this big contentious thing are Bitcoin's competitors and adversaries. Don't fall into their trap of sowing discord and division, that's what they want. So far all we can say for sure is that SegWit adoption is growing faster than former soft forks, we'll have to re-evaluate in a couple weeks to see whether it's still on track or not. All the rest of your arguments is just speculative noise.

Bitcoin is a way to transact value between person A and B anywhere in the world without A having to trust or know B and without having to rely on a middleman (a bank) to execute your transaction. Transactions are executed by a big decentralized network of computers that is impossible to shutdown. Also there are a limited supply of bitcoins that can ever be made similar to gold, this prevents artificial inflation and the devaluation of the coin over time for the benefit of a few who have the power to create money (ie. the Federal Reserve). You might care about this if you have lived through the 2008 financial crisis and don't like how banks had to be bailed out with our tax money because they were considered 'too big to fail'. If you want to be in control of your own money (basically be your own bank), or want a hedge against inflation and the systemic risk of banks and fiat monetary policy Bitcoin might be interesting for you.
For me what's most interesting about Bitcoin is that it's a borderless, decentralized and trustless system. I believe fiat currencies are unstable long term and have serious inefficiencies and other drawbacks because it requires trust in a small elite group of people who have too much power. I believe fundamentally that money and the creation of it should not be left to a select few. As the saying goes: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

With a deflationary currency you'd be able to borrow less and make a bigger down payment with your savings, the entire calculation becomes different as the market adapts to a deflationary currency. I'm sure the risk calculation and future market expectations will be taken into account to make this not really a problem at all in reality. In fact I expect the opposite as people will have less debts and more savings which will make defaults less likely.

There is no gridlock, only in the eyes of companies who thought Bitcoin could scale to Visa levels within a year. I'm glad those companies are leaving now, they lack foresight and vision and so we're much better off without them. I'm glad Core knows what's actually important and they don't let some small minded short term thinking CEO's rush them into delivering bad code that could endanger the stability and decentralized nature of the network. Bitcoin is moving forward just fine as it is.

Plenty of economies have fared really well with deflationary currencies, I suggest you look this up yourself.

I've studied many sources to come to my own conclusion there is no conclusive evidence of Russian hackers meddling in US elections. I am not the only one who thinks that. Back in the day intelligence sources and everyone else were also so sure of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which turned out to be false as well. Your video also shows no evidence at all, just a lot of talk by old people stuck in cold war thinking without any understanding of actual cyber security. Assange said their source didn't come from Russia, also former British ambassador Craig Murray claimed he knew the source of the leak and it wasn't Russian. I've also studied the Intelligence Report on Russian hacking and it also contained no actual proof. [Read this article]( for a good critical look at the so-called evidence for Russian hacking.
By the way, I'm not saying the Russians are definitely not behind the DNC hack/leak just that the available evidence is very flimsy. I just observe a lot of paranoia regarding Russian hacking and I also find it hypocritical as the US has meddled in a lot more elections than the Russians ever supposedly have. I also find it unimportant who is responsible for the hack, the information that came out is something the public had a right to know about before making their decision who to vote for. I thank Wikileaks for providing us the information we need to make an informed decision.

You'll have to compare how much mining is contributing to the destruction of our ecosystem to how much Bitcoin is saving it through the reduction of redundant consumption. I think it would be a net positive for Bitcoin, but that depends on the numbers you use and how you calculate it.

A linear chart would make Bitcoin seem like an even bigger deal, those periodic bull runs look completely crazy on a linear chart. Sure the dumps look worse as well but they are completely overshadowed by the steep increases. There are plenty of misleading ads to be found everywhere, but this isn't one of them imo. It's a simple highlight of Bitcoin's rise since its invention, nothing misleading about that it's just a fact which the log chart doesn't even do justice.

Bybit is not a scam, it's just a bitcoin futures trading platform like Bitmex. Carl has made a tutorial about them and people can use his affiliate link to trade there with some mutual benefits for Carl and the one using his link. Nothing wrong with that, it's an effective way to get people to spread the word and draw more users to your trading platform.

The same pattern keeps repeating, back in 2013 everyone told me I was buying into a scam when I bought BTC at $100 each. Then I was suddenly a genius when price went to $1100. However then price fell back to $200 and friends were making fun of me again for not selling and believing in this shit, even though I was still up 100% from my initial investment. Then 2017 happened and everyone was asking me how to buy at $10k+. Obviously almost all of them sold again at a loss during the bear market and are looking weird at me again for still holding. Most people just don't get it, they don't understand money and they can't see things from a long term perspective. I've tried educating my friends and family but sadly only a select few of them actually bother to listen, the rest is blinded by skepticism and shortsightedness. I guess we have a few more of these cycles left to go.

I've re-read it, still no logical reasoning to be seen from you. Unless you find this to be logical:


Which makes no logical sense and which I countered with the argument that the rich already convert their fiat into deflationary assets. Except the poor are stuck with inflationary fiat now so they are at an even bigger disadvantage. Also nothing wrong with not spending past our immediate needs, people are free to delay instant gratification by increasing their wealth through savings for better long term prospects.
Oh well this was a nice discussion, back to buying bitcoin now.

Nothing special perhaps, but the consequence of this fractional reserve system is a perpetually inflating credit bubble that leads to devastating boom bust cycles and the devaluation of our money. 2008 wasn't anything special either.


Sure it could, but it will be more risky and more transparent, and it gives me as a customer the option to opt out if I don't agree with their policy or if I find it too risky for the reward I get for loaning my money out to them. Too big to fail and moral hazard is less likely to happen with Bitcoin, banks that screw up and go bust simply go bust and have to live with the consequences, as do their customers and sharesholders. This allows proper risk assessment and accountability.

No, the definition of fiat is 'by decree', as in the government decrees (gives its fiat) that something is money and so it is. I do not believe in fiat money in that I don't believe it's a good form of money and will lose its value over time but that doesn't mean I think it has no value at this point. There is still a market for it after all, even though I don't think it will last much longer.

You're only options seem to be to buy a miner (see [ ), but this is quite expensive though. You'll probably pay as much in electricity to mine as it would cost to buy the same amount of coin on an exchange, but you'll get anonymous coins so it might be worth it to someone who cares about privacy.
Your other option is to find someone who wants to sell coins for you for cash. There are apps you can download that can connect you to sellers in your neighborhood, or perhaps you know a friend who has some coins and wants to sell you some.

Bitcoin is simply a safer bet. Altcoins do not have the same amount of security, brand recognition, liquidity, decentralization and longevity as Bitcoin has. Sure some will be able to ride under the wings of Bitcoin when it starts to run again, but which ones that will be is largely a gamble. And if Bitcoin runs bad then alts will do even worse. The top 10 coins in 2013 have all done worse than BTC has, only Litecoin has been able to limit the damage relative to BTC and is still relevant today. It's your own choice what to invest in of course, but personally I am playing it safe and not going to gamble with alts. I do have a few litecoins and some nano as well, but that's just a small percentage of my total portfolio.
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:01:16

That's just a matter of semantics really. In practice from a single $100 deposit $900 of loans can be created through these loan chains. For all intents and purposes that is creating money, at some point $900 (plus interest) has to be paid back by the borrower and that money has to come from somewhere. The money exists within the economy, they're on the books and if like you said all people start asking for their money there is a problem.

Uhh no this is not how Bitcoin is evolving, there's a reason why we're keeping the base layer lightweight enough so that most people can run their own full node and verify their own transactions.

The question is if more children will be abused if possession of CP becomes legal. You could argue both sides here I think. By legalizing it pedophiles have a legal outlet for their feelings and this could lower the risk of them abusing real children. We could portray them as monsters but I think most of them are real human beings just like you and I who are struggling with their sexuality, and providing some kind of outlet for their sexual frustration might help them deal with it. The buying and selling of CP should not be legalized though as that will foster a market for it and that will increase the production of new CP.

LTC has faster and more reliable transactions than BCH and fees are the same, and LTC has all the advantages of Segwit to boot. Don't see why anyone would pick BCH over LTC if you care about quick and cheap transactions.

Tax owed when withdrawing depends on where you live, in my country we don't owe any taxes on capital gains. And even in the US you only owe tax on your profit, this still beats a bank savings account by a long shot imo. Yes Bitcoin carries higher risk, but I like the risk vs reward ratio a lot. To each their own, I'm perfectly happy using my Bitcoin wallet as a savings account. There are not many good options left for saving nowadays, and for me all things considered Bitcoin is simply the best option right now. This probably says more about the current state of the financial/banking system than it says about Bitcoin though.

I was saying that I do not see why people would prefer BCH over LTC if they care about cheap and fast transactions. And not many people are using them actually. Looking at the actual transactions currently BCH and LTC are doing pretty much the same amount of transactions per day, which amounts to less than 10% of the amount of Bitcoin transactions each day, even though Bitcoin transactions are way more expensive and BCH and LTC have a higher capacity for transactions.

You are blind if you do not see how heavily centralized mining is currently. The NYA would not even be possible without it, a handful of pool operators can simply flip a switch and bam you suddenly have 95% of the miners signaling for it. Most of the individual miners aren't ideologically motivated, so they will just stay with the pool they feel most comfortable at and the only thing that would make them switch pools is if they have an economic incentive for it. That's all fine and dandy, but this makes miner signaling a really bad way of gauging support for or against a certain protocol upgrade. No matter whether you call this a mining cartel or not, the power a few mining pool operators have over the percentage of signaling is pretty obvious so you can't take that as a basis to measure consensus or contentiousness. Creating futures markets like we saw with Segwit2X and BU earlier is a way more decentralized and accurate way to measure this. And seeing how the market responded to Segwit activation I think it was pretty clear that the community badly wanted Segwit and only a small percentage was against it. Those who didn't like it have created BCH and there you also clearly see the market preferring Segwit over simply creating bigger blocks.

They can go negative, but those are very dangerous and desperate measures. That would be analogous to giving a patient who already OD'd on cocaine another big shot of cocaine hoping they can bring him back to life this way.

Mycelium has bad fee estimations, you can use low priority just fine.

But even better I would recommend a wallet that uses Segwit.

Your point being? Auroracoin used to be a top 3 coin on coinmarketcap as well, now it's somewhere down in the dumps. Coinbase hasn't even released the BCH from their customers yet, so there are lots of coins not able to be sold on the market right now propping up its value.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:04:56
I don't hate BCH. The only thing I don't like is how certain BCH proponents try to confuse people into thinking that BCH = Bitcoin. Now BCH supporters are free to believe their coin is better than BTC and that it's the future of crypto, but I don't feel it's okay to try and steal the name and brand of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin and is called Bitcoin Cash. They distinguish themselves by having more blockspace and no SegWit, and if people think that's the way forward they should definitely go for it. I fully support their freedom of choice here. But if you go around telling people that Bitcoin Cash is the one and only true original Bitcoin then you're intentionally misleading and confusing people and that's just not okay in my opinion. 
On the technical side of things there are a few things I don't like about BCH, the most important one is the fact that it allows Bitmain to keep mining at an advantage with their patented tech ASICBOOST. This leads BCH mining to be much more centralized than BTC. Another thing I don't like is that they don't have the advantages of Segwit, and that 8MB blocks when filled would stress nodes too much and slow block propagation through the network which also increases centralization pressures. Also I don't see BCH having as many developers working on it and the whole development process seems to lack peer review and proper testing. I do not see how they can compete with the Core development team in this way. Anyway that's just my two cents, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about which coin they prefer.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:40:55


Oh they're definitely there, I know a lot of them that just let the chart tell them everything they need to know. Personally I use a mix of both technical and fundamental analysis, and this BCH run doesn't look like anything that threatens BTC fundamentally. Just like Bitcoin 'banning' China doesn't threaten BTC fundamentally, even though there are and were people who do think so. You don't seem to think China makes a difference fundamentally, but you do think this is the case for BCH. That's fair enough and your opinion which I respect, but there were also many people who did believe China news was an existential threat and therefore sincerely believed that dip was somehow 'different'. To me they're all the same, it's a buy the fucking dip moment again.

Segwit wasn't really contentious, miners just wanted to play political powergames and their signaling or lack thereof was not really representative of the community's wishes. Especially considering how much hashrate Bitmain and their pools control. The fact that only a handful of people can come together and the next day 90% of all hashrate was suddenly signaling for Segwit shows how badly centralized mining has become.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:10:17


You need to move your coins to an exchange or wallet that uses Segwit addresses, from then on you're using Segwit whenever you send coins from that exchange or wallet.
I believe Bitstamp is the only exchange so far that has actually implemented Segwit, and Bitfinex said they were working on it now. Wallets that use Segwit addresses are Trezor, Ledger, GreenAddress, GreenBits (Android), Electrum and Samourai wallet. That's all I know so far, it would be nice to have a site or something that tracks the wallets/exchanges that use Segwit so people know what to look for.

A dip is a dip, what else can a dip be but a dip? You can either say every dip is different or every dip is the same. For technical analysts they're all the same and part of waves and market cycles, news is irrelevant for them and only work as catalysts. Bitcoin was primed for a correction, and even started correcting before the whole crazy Bcash run started so it doesn't even really matter in the big picture.

It's called dollar cost averaging, and you don't buy until you run out of fiat, you buy until you have accumulated enough so that you will have no regrets when the price does go to new highs. I prefer this option above buying only when we do break all time high and the FOMO is real.

You didn't have to pay $5 for a transaction, Mycelium allows you to set cheaper fees. Also you should consider using a wallet that has implemented Segwit like Electrum or Greenaddress (Greenbits for Android), it will also save you fees. Not sure why Mycelium hasn't implemented Segwit yet, I used to like them but they seem very slow with these crucial updates now.


The cause of the high fee pressure right now is BCH is being pumped and miners are switching to mining BCH which is making BTC blocks slower for a while until BCH difficulty adjusts and miners switch back to BTC again (see above). Not sure what we can do about this, probably with the EDA on BCH being fixed soon after their hard fork we will experience this problem less often. Also more people and wallets adopting Segwit will help alleviate this problem as well. Beyond that we will have to wait for other scaling solutions and optimizations to be implemented like schnorr, MAST, LN, and others.


Basically we have to be patient for 2nd/3rd layer solutions. Bitcoin needs to keep its censorship resistant properties and that means that for now we'll have to sometimes pay higher fees for speedy transactions until these solutions can be properly implemented on the network.

* it's a backroom deal: centralized decision-making
* very few developers involved, where are the tests/peer review?
* it's rushed
* it's unnecessary
* no replay protection: messy fork
And I could go on and on about all the issues with 2x. I would laugh if they weren't actually serious about going through with this. The market will sort it out though in the end, but some noobs will likely lose money after this fork or end up on the wrong chain. Miners will get hurt the most but some of them don't mind as they want BCH to take over and start mining that profitably instead. What will actually happen though is that they will shoot themselves in the foot and kill the entire 2+ year bull market in the entire cryptomarket with this move. They'll probably still blame the Core developers for their own mess they created. But maybe that's exactly what we need: a 1-2 year long bear market to sort this whole mess out and weed out the bad actors.

Dropping the interest rates to zero has barely managed to stimulate the economy at all, the world economy has pretty much grinded to a halt even with interest rates at zero for 6 years. If it actually had managed to stimulate the economy and growth had been established then they would have raised the rates already. But it hasn't so they can't and won't do it. You don't need to study economy at an academic level to be able to grasp this.

Not now, Bitcoin can't compete with Visa at this moment its primary value proposition is coming from censorship resistant value transfer and store of value. Personally I don't mind paying a small fee for that. In the future with all the new tech in the pipeline Bitcoin will also become a better payment system so then it would make more sense to book your flights using Bitcoin. Even now I pay only around $0.25 fee when using Bitcoin, so for a $200 flight that's basically nothing.

He does cherry pick data the same way to back his position, not much difference really. Looking at average fees is just a bad metric, and even looking at median fees is bad without taking into account further context. Like wallet fee estimation is still pretty bad leading to many people overpaying. And back when the EDA was still active on BCH they would sometimes leech a lot of hashpower away from Bitcoin leading to slower blocks and therefore mempool congestion and higher median fees.
That said obviously BTC fees are higher than BCH fees, but that's no surprise with BTC being used a whole lot more (350k tx/day vs 20k tx/day).

They are too extreme for my taste, they believe it's okay to scale onchain to 10GB blocks no problem which is crazy imo. They are also way too hostile towards Bitcoin, harboring conspiracy theories about blockstream, core etc.. I also don't like how they pretend that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and try to mislead newcomers. And Bitmain is way too dominant in BCH, which isn't strange considering they started the coin. If BCH didn't have all that they could have been an alternative option for cheaper fees for me, but currently Litecoin or Nano look like much more pleasant options to me if fees really become too high. Their communities seem nice and they don't shit all over bitcoin.
I believe there are serious trade offs at play regarding scaling onchain and security/decentralization, and they have to be considered and taken into account. You can only mess up once at the base protocol layer. That said you can also be too conservative, I don't believe a moderate blocksize increase would be harmful.

Lower fees may not be the primary reason why I'm here, but fees can make it impractical for me to actually use bitcoin. And for the unbanked and those who live in developing countries bitcoin will simply be too expensive. If I want to leave fiat money behind and use bitcoin for most of my expenses the transaction fees will have to be reasonable. I don't really care about buying coffee with it, just being able to pay rent, food, or pay a friend $50 in bitcoin because of some service he did for me, those kind of things I want to be able to do with crypto. I could use fiat money for those things, but I prefer to use crypto if I can because I don't like fiat money and no longer want to depend on banks.
So, if bitcoin fees become too high what's exactly the problem if I use an alternative crypto for those things like litecoin or nano for example? You may say well those are not as decentralized as bitcoin is, but is that really a good reason? I mean the lightning network isn't as secure and decentralized as bitcoin is, but the plan is that people will start using it to pay for things. Then why not use litecoin or nano instead to pay for stuff, while keeping most of your savings in bitcoin as the most secure and decentralized layer? Altcoins could serve as the second layer of bitcoin in this case. And besides, I'm not convinced that litecoin or nano aren't safe and decentralized enough or can't achieve this in the future. What exactly makes bitcoin so special that it's the only crypto out there that can have these desired characteristics? I used to be pretty much a maximalist but now I'm not so sure, my thinking has become more practical and less rigid in that way. I dislike the greedy attitude of many altcoiners who are only in it for the quick gains and the lambos, but we see the same attitude also in bitcoin so it's not that different really. Time will weed those people out eventually.

Nothing to do with childish stuff like fomo or folo, just regular market activity. When I need to sell some of my coins for whatever reason I want to do it quickly and not wait a whole day. This is not the fiat banking system where international transfers take several days. I'm okay with paying a bit more for that, clearly others are too otherwise fees wouldn't be that high. And if the fees ever do become too high for me and I'm priced out of the market I can and will use a cheaper alternative like litecoin or nano. No problem for me. :)

So how do we normal people who aren't millionairs transact if onchain transactions cost thousands of dollars each? Even if we use lightning we'd still need to pay thousands of dollars just to open or close a channel. Sorry but this is going to drive most people away from Bitcoin if this is the direction it is going. Who is even going to buy Bitcoin if it costs them over $1000 just to move the coins into their newly created wallet? Maybe Bitcoin is meant to just be a tool for the rich to secure and store their money, in that case I'll probably use Litecoin or something like Nano instead. Not because I want to, because I love Bitcoin and would like it to also be useful for people like me, but I will be forced off the network if this becomes a reality and I will simply have to be looking for an alternative (no not bcash).
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:21:38
There are many reasons why you might want quick confirmations. Sometimes I want to move coins from my hardware wallet to an exchange for example and I want to do it rather quickly so there's less risk of the price changing a lot in the meantime.

As for what to do about it, I think many people are already busy with that. Bitmain's asicboost advantage needs to be nullified first, this allows (potential) competitors to be able to compete with Bitmain which will decrease their power. After that there is more to be done to decentralize mining out of China, but these few things will already help a lot. A successful UASF can also set a precedent to limit the power of miners to block important protocol upgrades, and work on this is also being done right now.

No. Most in the technical community have serious objections against a hard fork to increase the block limit right now, as well as many people in the rest of the community. It's definitely not just the Core devs, although Classic supporters might want to make it look that way.
@_date: 2016-02-15 14:08:57
You don't understand what ''contentious'' means at all. In the contextual sense of the current debate a hard fork to 2MB is still contentious, no twisting of words will change this fact. There are many people who do not want to have anything to do with Classic and will stick with Core or sell their coins if they have to. If you don't see this, well in Satoshi's words I have no time to try and convince you otherwise.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:45:02
The important thing is not that the change happens, the important thing is that there's sufficient consensus for a change and Bitcoin will remain Bitcoin without splitting the entire community and ecosystem in two. 90% should be the minimum with a 6 month grace period in my opinion. That said I must admit that I don't like Classic at all and it feels unnecessarily divisive.

Fees are around $0.50 these days if you donate $10 in BTC, not $5. I see it is an issue for very small transactions, but it's a temporary one if we can move the ecosystem forward and activate Segwit and bring in the Lightning Network. I'm happy with my BTC as mainly a store of value and move larger amounts of money around in a borderless censorship resistant manner, but it would be even nicer if we could get united as a community and bring Segwit + Lightning onboard as well so we can comfortably do smaller sized transactions again.
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:31:16
The change is not contentious, everyone knows a hard fork to increase the limit has to happen in the future. What's contentious is the way how (Classic/XT) and the timing. A hard fork now would be contentious, a hard fork later after SegWit and some other network improvements have been implemented and the necessary preparations have been taken would not be contentious.

49% consider themselves ''Big Blockers". I am one of them, but that doesn't mean I support shoving big blocks down the throats of all users on the network. If there is wide consensus then I would support a certain hard fork proposal to bigger blocks, but Unlimited is just a very bad way to do it. Segwit as a soft fork is by far the better option and therefore has much bigger community support behind it, except a few miners who control a disproportionally large amount of hashrate have decided to block it and keep us in this deadlock. Such a shame it is, we could have made much more progress by now but it is being stalled. :(

A fork in the current hostile climate is dangerous imo, why risk it? There is no hurry at all, fees are still pretty cheap if you want a timely transaction.

The vast majority? Based on what data exactly? I value decentralization as much as the core devs, and also am convinced scaling will happen if we continue to value decentralization as one of Bitcoin's main assets.

Actually we can do much more as users. We can do UASF, we can buy or sell coins, we can run full nodes, and we can vote with our wallet who to do business with. Waiting for the devs to do something is silly, they do not have the power you think they have.

Stop looking at others to make the decisions for us, we already have all the power we need to act and do something.

Long term a fee market is indeed necessary to pay for the security of the network, even Satoshi said so in his white paper.


This is false and purely conjecture on your part. Decentralization concerns are the primary reason for their reluctance, no core developer has ever said otherwise. They might have mentioned the fee market as well, but never stated it as their primary reason.

But wasn't this clear already back in August? I mean you need to have your head pretty deep into the sand to think that there was anything even remotely resembling consensus for the Segwit2X fork. I just have a hard time believing an intelligent man like Erik Voorhees could believe this idea had consensus. Maybe he only looked at the miners signaling for it and thought that was enough? Still seems very disconnected from reality if that was the case. Only a handful of mining pool operators are needed to make 90%+ signal for something, such a thing can't possibly measure consensus within the entire community.
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:13:58
No it's not, not if there's consensus about such a change. You're using the same flawed logic as those who call Classic an altcoin because it changes the consensus rules. Actually the people who call Classic an altcoin have more of a point, since the Classic fork would be contentious and a new PoW for Core most likely wouldn't be. What Bitcoin is is not just decided by the miners, but by the entire ecosystem. Anyway this discussion about how to call each coin after such a fork is pointless, Bitcoin basically would split in two Bitcoins (Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic) because the community is divided and many will pick a side they see as the one and only true Bitcoin. I prefer not to find out how this will work itself out in reality but if we have to I know I will stick with Core.

Several teams competing to add features to the protocol is a good thing, but several teams competing to try and change the protocol itself in different ways is only a great way to fracture the entire community and destroy Bitcoin. Why doesn't he understand this?

No it's not. Look up the word contentious in the dictionary.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:52:56
Replies like yours are getting very tiring. It's not that 2MB is a big problem, it's that a hard fork itself carries a lot of risk if you don't have a broad consensus and don't take the necessary time and preparations for it. Right now all core devs believe a soft fork to implement SegWit is a much safer and better way to give the blocks some more room to grow. After that some of them will work hard to write the code for an actual hard fork, which then given enough support from the devs and community will be deployed somewhere in 2017. I don't see the need to create any drama over this, unless you purposely want to stall and hamper the Bitcoin development process.
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:35:43
The network can handle 2Mb blocks, but segwit + 2Mb would result in a max blocksize of 4-8Mb which is at this point too much. So that's why I think they chose for segwit alone first through soft fork, then more network improvements and then finally a blocksize limit increase when the network is more capable of handling it. What's wrong with this route? 
@_date: 2017-04-22 12:33:25
Segwit fixes several issues and opens up the way for further network improvements, it's not primary a blocksize limit increase. It should have been implemented on Bitcoin already but is being stalled because of politics. Glad to see Litecoin is on its way to activating it soon, gave me a reason to diversify a few BTC into LTC myself.
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:21:21
I agree, a successful UASF in Litecoin will set a very important precedent for Bitcoin to do the same. And there's also another important reason for them to signal Segwit for Litecoin: profit from a higher LTC price. On Bitcoin they could also profit from signalling Segwit, but I guess they calculated that those profits would not compensate for the loss of their ASICboost advantage.
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:00:44
It IS going to be a cash replacement, it just takes a bit of time before long term scaling solutions have been properly implemented. People nowadays just want everything right NOW and have no patience or long term vision.

They are not part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, I'm fine with altcoins existing besides Bitcoin. If the Classic team called their coin Classic and didn't try to hijack the Bitcoin mining network I would be perfectly fine with them and I'd even support them.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:49:43
I would be happy to start up my old GPU mining rig again to secure the original chain, and I'm sure many others would too. As a positive side effect, Bitcoin mining will become more decentralized again. :)

He didn't say they don't have a say, they have a say like everyone in the Bitcoin community has a say. However, miners can not unilaterally decide to hard fork without the support from the wider community.
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:06:13
I agree there's an issue, that's pretty obvious. But to me it seems the issue is actually starting to come down somewhat recently. 20% sounds about what I was thinking the support for Classic would be, perhaps a bit higher around 30% at most. I don't see it coming close to 75%, even with intensive lobbying. I used to be a (moderate) XT supporter myself, but after Mike Hearn quit I started to research Core's position and arguments better and had to conclude that I was focused too much on the short term and my opinion was guided more by my anti-Theymos censorship sentiments rather than that I was truly of the opinion that the blocksize had to be raised right now. I believe there are many like me. I now understand the trade-offs between blocksize and decentralization better and see that development is a slow, deliberate process and that we shouldn't rush things. Especially not a hard fork. On the other hand I understand that this issue has been raised years ago and something probably should have been done earlier to prevent the issue from blowing up like it has.
Anyway, the way I see it most people do not want to see an actual split of Bitcoin. The Classic/XT supporters just want some reassurance that Bitcoin will be allowed to grow with the amount of users in a reasonable timeframe. And they use their support for Classic as a way to put pressure on Core to do something and reach some kind of compromise. Personally I feel that Core lately has done a lot to try and explain their position better to the community, I at least have gained a lot of understanding recently. Now for some this isn't enough and they want a more precise schedule for an eventual hard fork to increase the limit. Whether Core appeases these people or not, I feel that enough people realize that the disagreement is not important enough to split the whole thing up for and endanger the project.
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:03:10
Anyone can work on Bitcoin Core with the necessary skills, they don't accept or exclude people based on their personal opinions. If you don't have those skills yourself you have no choice but to trust other people who do have those skills. Or do you want a bunch of monkeys to work on coding for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:58:57


It's certainly a trade-off, Bitcoin is definitely the most secure and decentralized coin out there. The question is, are Litecoin and Nano secure/decentralized/immutable enough to depend on for uncensorable money? I don't think there is a definite answer to that yet, but as fees rise on Bitcoin that question will certainly be put to the test. I am no longer as much of an altcoin sceptic as I used to be, I must admit. That said, most of my money in crypto stays in BTC for now.
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:08:39
Where did it say they would increase the blocksize limit to just 2MB? I don't see a number in this statement so it could also be 4MB or 2-4-8 or something like that.
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:36:37
Segwit isn't contentious at all, Jihan Wu and a few others have created a false controversy around it. Extension blocks isn't as well tested and scrutinized as Segwit is, so this idea actually is in fact still very much contentious.

@_date: 2016-02-25 00:51:30
There are certainly additional risks, especially if you try to push a hard fork through too quickly. Is the reasoning circular? Not really because even most if not all of the core devs are in favor of a hard fork at some point, but they have a more prudent approach and they see a rushed hard fork as risky. You need to get the entire community and ecosystem working together to make the hard fork a success, and this is hard to accomplish when there is so much discontent and distrust towards each other. So I don't think Classic is the way to do it safely at least.

Not necessarily true, heating applications of mining for example could make individual small-time operations competitive again with the mining farms. I would gladly buy something that could mine BTC and provide warm water or manage the temperature in my room at the same time.

That's one way to spin it. Here is another from the roundtable meeting article:
"Finally, we want to emphasize that this roundtable meeting represents only the consensus of participating members, and cannot make decision on behalf of the Litecoin community. Our goal is to build a more harmonious community and realize long-term healthy growth, and we wish to have the support from the wider community."
I agree though this shouldn't happen in Bitcoin and also wasn't necessary in Litecoin. It would just have taken a bit longer for the market to force Jihan Wu out of the way of blocking Segwit, but it would have been healthier. Good thing Litecoin is mostly a testcase for Bitcoin though, I'm sure Bitcoin will be taking the healthier but longer process.
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:44:45


I don't think this is true, this is a serious issue and unless your head is covered deep in the sand you can't downplay this. I wouldn't let Bitfury get away with it or make any excuses for them if they were in Bitmain's shoes. I support Core but I don't like how I am being put in these two polarized political boxes. It's like Democrats vs Republicans, as if there are only these two specific camps you can belong to or choose from. It's disgusting, we need to stop talking and thinking within these small confined boxes. It's what keeps us divided and we reinforce this divide ourselves constantly by talking about it like this.
I don't want to belong to any side, I just want Bitcoin to move forward and fix its issues. Antbleed and Asicboost are issues, as is Bitmain's dominance in the mining market. Scaling is also an issue, and has several good proposals to move it forward. BU is not one of them, and I think we've seen enough evidence of that by now. I hope we can leave that behind us soon and move forward again with Segwit + Lightning, and other awesome protocol upgrades and features.

It doubles capacity on-chain, you call that barely noticeable? Blocks being full is fine, this is the standard now as there will always be demand for more capacity. 2MB, 4MB or 8MB will all quickly fill up again. Fee pressure will be lower though, and that's what it's really about. I like 2MB with SegWit SF first and then Lightning, seems to make the most sense to me. Don't know why there is so much fuss over this all to be honest, the alternatives all require hard forks and are controversial, risky and not very realistic to be realized very soon.
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:40:18


Segwit is not just a bump in blocksize limit, it fixes many things and paves the way for real long term scaling solutions and things like schnorr signatures. It's not just kicking the can down the road. You want to just throw away all the testing and work done on Segwit to work another year on testing and scrutinizing this extension blocks idea which is way more criticized than Segwit is? No thanks we've been in this deadlock long enough, Segwit is ready right now and is supported by a large majority of users, technical experts, exchanges and businesses already. If you personally don't like it then don't use it, it's backwards compatible after all. We need to move on.
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:17:05


Bitcoin is not suitable for microtransactions right now. You'll have to wait for the Lightning Network to be deployed if you're interested in that kind of thing. There is no way the Bitcoin blockchain itself is able to accommodate big volume of microtransactions while still staying secure and decentralized.
@_date: 2016-02-26 09:04:29


If Gavin and Mike Hearn had just worked within core and proposed a 2MB increase instead of 20MB, yes this entire issue would probably be behind us now. Instead they pushed for an irresponsible increase and when the other core devs pointed that out they tried it with XT, causing a rift within the community. Only very recently they have started pushing for a 2MB limit but now we already have SegWit underway, and I can't blame the core devs for giving that priority over a hard fork now. I won't say this is all the fault of Gavin and Mike, but clearly they could have handled this a LOT better.
@_date: 2019-04-11 09:00:33
I don't have time to explain why the current fiat system is broken, read the Bitcoin Standard from Saifedean Ammous for a pretty good explanation. The current debt based system is unsustainable and parasitic in nature. Or read up on Austrian economics in general to get an idea why I believe we need hard and independent money like Bitcoin and not the kind of money we have now. 
Anyway Bitcoin for me is great for a number of reasons:
* It's decentralized, no central institution like a bank or government can shut it down or control it for their own benefit
* It's global, bitcoin knows no borders and is easily transported everywhere
* Supply is limited, no more than 21M coins. This makes it a good store of value similar to gold, the money of the old world
* You don't need a bank to hold your money and send it somewhere for you, you can send money peer to peer directly to someone over the internet without going through a third party. This is like when email allowed us to send letters directly to someone instead of giving the letter to the post office first and trusting them to deliver it for you. It's just way faster and more efficient. The trustless nature of bitcoin is for me its greatest asset.
In short, bitcoin is sovereign money. I like being in full control of my own money and not needing to depend on a bank to send money for me. I am convinced that bitcoin is a monetary evolution like the internet is an evolution in communication and sharing information.

That's pure speculation on your part without any proof whatsoever. Price also doubled in 2012 before the last halving, and then soon after the halving it went up way higher. The price is also being held back by the whole block size drama and fear of contentious hard forks.

It's a consensus between the Core development team and representatives of miners (mostly) in China. How would Classic's method be any different?

It's never good for you guys is it?
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:11:28
Yeah I wouldn't recommend actually using very low fees unless the mempool has been pretty much empty for a while. I always have a quick look at the mempool and eyeball the fee I'd like to use, usually I find 5-15 sat/byte a safe fee to use if I'm not in too much of a hurry. Lightning will have to be the future for Bitcoin payments, or perhaps sidechains?

@_date: 2016-02-11 13:57:22
No it's not. 75% of miners deciding to run a certain client does not mean that 75% of the Bitcoin ecosystem agrees with the change. So even if you think that 75% agreeing constitutes a consensus (which I personally don't) that condition is still not being met here.
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:13:51


You don't know that, it's obviously more efficient and cheaper than just running a mining rig and let the produced heat go to waste.


Thinking something is impossible or will never change is closing your mind to solutions that may be out there but you will never find because you think it's impossible.

@_date: 2016-02-14 01:44:15

It was an EXAMPLE to show how in the future mining could perhaps redecentralize away from China. I gave other ideas and there are many more, you just refuse to look at the bigger picture I was painting. My main point still stands, you are thinking about problems and impossibilities and I'm thinking about solutions and possibilities. End of discussion thank you.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:08:55
I was only talking about hard forks regarding consensus, which changes the basic rules of the Bitcoin protocol for everyone in every situation. RBF was changed to opt-in because there was no consensus, at least not outside the developer community. If there was consensus it would not have been opt-in.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:17:29
The world is not going to jump into Bitcoin today, it is still too young for that. We need to allow the developers to lay the proper foundations first, which means sticking with small blocks for now. Even with bigger blocks most people of the earth still won't be able to use Bitcoin as a payment system, and it becomes censorable as well which means it's useless. Be patient and wait for true scaling solutions to come out, we have some years to go to see Bitcoin truly blossom in full form.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:12:48
Exactly this. It's the aggressive attempt to change the consensus rules of the Bitcoin protocol without taking any safety measures or proper testing and also bypassing the community and users altogether by just trying to convince the miners to run your non-compatible code. Alternate compatible clients pose no harm whatsoever and they can freely coexist.
@_date: 2016-02-03 23:38:00
There are many core devs who don't work for blockstream and also agree it's better to implement SegWit before any blocksize limit increases. Also technical experts like Nick Szabo and others are of the same opinion. In any case it doesn't sound like a good idea to go for a hard fork when there are so many against it. The more practical thing to do here would be to deploy SegWit and other scalability improvements first and then go for a hard fork. Scalability &gt; Scaling seems more logical to me than the other way around. Anyway I don't really care I just want us to move forward and stop fighting. So sick of this crap, everyone involved is invested in Bitcoin and wants it to scale.
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:51:01
There are some existing ideas to redecentralize mining without changing the PoW algorithm, like heating applications of mining equipment. I happen to know someone who has built something like this himself and he is able to get warm water now using his mining equipment. Also the energy could become more expensive in China or cheaper in the rest of the world which would also help decentralize it outside of China. There may exist other solutions as well which we haven't actually thought of yet. Stop thinking so small and limited, hopium is the reason mankind is now able to fly around the world and go to the moon.

Bitmain already came out and said they love and welcome lightning, as it will bring more users and money into Bitcoin. They even welcome SegWit, just not as a soft fork, which just so happens to be one of the things that would block the covert use of ASICBOOST. Now I'm fine with people having legit issues with SegWit, but if a secret patented advantage only available to certain miners is the reason a significant percentage of hashpower is against SegWit and blocking it then there certainly is a problem that needs to be fixed. Doing nothing is not an option here.

Please fork these Classic fools already, get them off our chain. Good riddance and have fun with your Classic coin.
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:57:02


Probably because increasing it now will decrease the pressure to make lightning ready for the masses, and to improve other things like increasing (native) segwit adoption. It basically lulls the network into a sense of complacency where we feel no need to improve the things that are needed for the long term health of the network. After almost two years we've only seen 50% segwit adoption and much less for native segwit (bech32 addresses), which would have pretty much doubled the blocksize to 2MB if all exchanges, users and wallets had upgraded. Now we have 1.3-1.4MB blocks with 50% adoption, of which only a few percentage uses the most efficient native segwit.

I don't need to try to prevent a change, there will be a change once there is a reasonable consensus about it and I'm fine with that. Everything else is just a distraction, including this nonsense about a contentious hard fork. It's just ridiculous, but I guess that's reddit.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:42:35
Where exactly do you see so much support for Classic? The support for Core is still overwhelmingly larger. Most of the mining community have come out and signed a letter recently that they don't want to run Classic or XT at all and prefer to continue with the Core development team. A Classic fork is very far away right now imo, I don't see it happening at all and I sure as hell hope it won't ever come to this. I agree that Core should probably switch to a different PoW algorithm if Classic succeeds, Core can't bow down to political pressure and set a really bad precedence for the future of the protocol if they do.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:18:45
Ah so you think you are smarter than all the active current Bitcoin developers combined who clearly prefer SegWit over a blocksize limit increase at this moment in time? What are your credentials?
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:39:47
You have no clue about anything. The majority doesn't want classic. Even if it did it would still not be a valid reason to change the basic rules of the protocol, you need consensus for that. The basic rules are meant to be hard to change, if hard forks are made easy with a simple majority vote Bitcoin will have failed and lose everything that gave it its value.
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:31:40
Core developers can deliver code for a HF, but there's no guarantee it will reach consensus. Miners can't demand consensus.
@_date: 2016-02-14 21:30:36
A contentious hard fork simply means there is disagreement and controversy surrounding a hard fork. Just by reading and listening to what many well known people in the Bitcoin ecosystem have said and written about it you can see that there is lots of disagreement about the current hard fork proposal called 'Classic', not just among the developers. In fact the core developers are pretty much all in agreement that SegWit should have a higher priority than a hard fork right now, so among them there is not really that much disagreement regarding this issue.
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:25:49
So you have to pay $0.05 per transaction now, good keeps the worthless spam transactions out at least. What's your problem exactly? That fees will increase? I would surely hope so because it shows there's increasing demand for Bitcoin transactions. I don't however believe it will increase at a pace that soon we will have to pay exorbitant fees in order to be able to transact, that's just not going to happen. At least not before SegWit will give blocks more room, and later on in 2017 hopefully through a hard fork as well. And not long after that there's a good chance LN will be ready or perhaps new scaling solutions that haven't been found yet. I see no need for the level of urgency you are trying to convey. Bitcoin is working just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:41:23
Bitcoin is growing just fine with the current 1MB blocks. We are not full and I can transact just fine in a peer-to-peer Bitcoin way if I want to.

With SegWit coming out soon and other network improvements, I feel you are just being incredibly impatient and shortsighted.

It would absolutely split the community, it doesn't matter if 100% of miners are economically forced to mine the new chain because of political lobbying. Users and holders of bitcoins unhappy with this hostile takeover will refuse to go along and will switch to a new PoW algorithm to continue the original chain. A hard fork can only be non-contentious if the wider Bitcoin ecosystem also accepts the change, not just 75% of miners.

Miners have a voice but they can't decide things unilaterally. Nodes, exchanges and the entire community are equally important here, if miners decide to do one thing and nodes and exchanges reject that thing the miners will be left with absolutely nothing.

They're not going to do this until Bitcoin has become much bigger and several technical problems have been solved like transaction volume. It's just way too small right now for them to be interested in something like that. Once market cap exceeds 100-200 billion I might expect such a move, hopefully at that time we have also managed to redecentralize Bitcoin mining away from China.

No that is a given. Only ignorant fools will claim that a 51% miner fork could be a smart thing to do. There will be chaos and a plummeting price, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to predict this. Splitting the entire network without sufficient consensus is never going to be a good thing.

A hard fork is not ready to go at all under the current hostile civil war climate. That's why a 2 MB hard fork will not happen now and a segwit soft fork is much safer.
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:19:36
Not all hard forks are contentious. The hard fork in March 2013 was not contentious at all and the community was united in fixing the problem. Now any planned and intentional hard fork will probably not have the same 100% consensus, but it can get pretty close when all the major players and experts agree on the hard fork. In such a case I would not call the hard fork contentious, even though there are always a few hardliners around on reddit who are against a hard fork no matter what. What we see now however can in no way be described as not contentious or anything coming close to a consensus.
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:12:05
75% is not really enough to remove the risk of a contentious hard fork and a split in the ecosystem, and 28 days is also way too short for everyone to adopt the change. I doubt 75% of miners will be running Classic any time soon though, but if they do I am holding my breath for what will happen next. Several [parties]( have already said they will not run Classic or any other proposed hard fork while there is no consensus. 75% of miners deciding to run Classic is definitely NOT consensus, you can't force consensus that way.
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:07:40
A vocal minority does not a consensus make. See what I did there? You assume the people against Classic's hard fork are a 'vocal minority' without any data to back this up. By looking at the number of subscribers at r/btc YOU are the vocal minority. You can put your hands against your ears and act like most people agree and there are only a handful of people making a lot of noise against it but it doesn't change the actual reality you have to deal with.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:16:06
You don't need consensus NOT to change things, you need consensus if you want to actually change the basic rules of the protocol. That's why Bitcoin is resistant to change so people can trust things like the 21M cap to stay the same even when there is a coup attempt by governments and lobbying groups to change these basic rules and take over control of Bitcoin. Core will not make any changes to the basic rules without seeking consensus first.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:52:33
Maybe those are 3 bad apples and the 1 good apple is able to stop their disease to spread to the rest of the apple population? Anyway the point is that a 75% miner threshold is not a good way to force a protocol change through.

Pretty much the entire Bitcoin economy has to support it. At least a very large majority of them or else you risk splitting the network or a huge dump in the value. And it isn't even a certainty that Core will reach consensus, as the two Core developers who went to the meeting went their on their own accord and do not speak on behalf of the entire team of Core developers.

I think he is still miffed about the Hong Kong agreement, where he was in support of Segwit. I think the Core devs who were there need to have a talk with him (and Jihan Wu) just to clear the misunderstandings that have arisen from that agreement. Besides that I think it's perfectly okay if an individual miner is personally against Segwit, but I don't like how entire pools and businesses decide for all of their miners whether to support Segwit or not. I wanted to buy a mining contract myself earlier this year, but I was told my hashrate would automatically support BU there and I could not support Segwit so I didn't buy the contract. I know many others are unknowingly helping to block Segwit this way. Running a miner at your own home is pretty rare these days, I can't afford it myself sadly. :(

This is not written in the protocol, Classic came up with the 75% threshold it's not part of the current Bitcoin protocol at all. You could say it's an attempt at a 75% mining attack on the Bitcoin network. Very dangerous situation and precedent this would create, if it succeeds.

No I think you're right, he is more busy causing drama and controversy lately rather than adding something of real value. It would be much more helpful if Gavin would stop his political campaign for hard forks and start contributing more to the code. I mean I do respect him and all the work he has done for BTC, but I really think he needs to stop trying to force his opinion on everyone else and accept there is no consensus for a hard fork right now and it's all hands on deck to work on SegWit and other things to make Bitcoin ready for the future. A hard fork will be announced eventually but with proper consensus and without stirring up drama and controversy.

At some point in the future when the market is largely saturated BTC will no longer increase that much in value. Against fiat it will still be gaining around 2-3% per year if central banks still exist and they think it's good to have inflation, but all this will accomplish is that people will store most of their savings in BTC and perhaps only keep their immediate spending money in fiat. Or they just use their BTC to spend from as well if it's convenient and cheap enough. You still need to spend your money to live and enjoy life after all, you can't eat BTC or do anything else useful with it.

Miners do not get paid a percentage of the sent amount, you're flat out wrong here. With the same amount of outputs I pay the exact same fee for sending 100 BTC as I pay for sending 0.01 BTC, percentage wise this is a huge difference.


Who cares about being guaranteed to be included in the very next block? I can pay 1 satoshi/byte fee and be confident it will get confirmed within the next couple of blocks, I do this all the time. And because I use segwit and have not sent a lot of dust transactions into my wallet my average transaction size is only 168 bytes. So I'm paying only 168 satoshi per transaction which is less than $0.02. I can see you barely do any transactions yourself or don't know how it actually works and just use the recommended fees.

The internet is a virtual concept too, that doesn't mean it isn't useful. Most of the value of gold doesn't come from its use in electronics or in space, it actually comes from its virtual properties.

If you lose your phone I would restore the wallet using the recovery seed on a new phone or pc and then move the coins to a new wallet with a new recovery seed.

If there are no good alternative options for you to buy I would just buy at Coinbase and then send the coins asap to your Trezor. That way if there's a fork in November you will have both B2x and BTC in your Trezor. If you leave the coins in Coinbase there's a good chance you will only be able to use and withdraw B2x after the fork.

I wasn't claiming that was all pure profit, just that there was plenty of money to be made. Electricity costs are 0 (excess solar power produced) for some miners, while others pay a little more.

Day trading can be profitable but only if you're better than the average trader and good at managing risk. It's stressful though and I wouldn't recommend it. Better imo is to trade the more longer term swings in the market which are easier to predict and don't cause as much stress. It requires a lot more patience though, sometimes you have to wait many months for your trade to work out. Easiest and probably most profitable for most people long term is to just accumulate Bitcoin now as long as there is an 80%+ discount from its high and wait for the next bull cycle to begin. This requires the most patience though, but is also the least stressful if you didn't invest too much.

This is simply false, the USD does not have any intrinsic value and still it is definitely a fiat currency. Fiat just means 'by decree' which in the case of fiat currency means that dollars are fiat currency because the government said so. It has nothing to do with something having intrinsic value whatsoever. Therefore Bitcoin can not be called a fiat currency, unless at some point a government gives it its fiat status.


Value is not intrinsic, it is always subjective. Things can only have value if people subjectively and collectively subscribe value to it. Doesn't matter what it is. Bitcoin is valued because it solves issues of trust, it is scarce, borderless, frictionless and has all the other properties of sound money. Its properties gives it its value. You may not see the value in those properties (many people didn't see the value in computers or the internet when they first came out), but there are clearly plenty of people who do.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:40:42
That's because it IS an investment and not much of a currency right now. This will probably change in the future, but Bitcoin will need to scale and increase its marketcap a lot first before it will be useful as a global currency as well as being a good store of value. We're simply not there yet, and until then I will hodl BTC and spend fiat to buy stuff.

Core is saying the base protocol layer is more suited as a settlement layer because it just doesn't scale very well. Which is objectively true. They don't say BTC as a whole should be a settlement layer only, obviously they are planning on scaling BTC in the future with LN, sidechains, drivechains and perhaps other second layer solutions. BCH is clearly more to their liking since it is more focused on scaling the base layer no matter the costs, so why wouldn't they stick to their favorite coin and stop bothering us?

We have just changed bitcoin's blocksize with Segwit.

That's not a good reason to do a disruptive hard fork. I'm glad the years of stagnation are over but the ones who want to really honor the second part of the agreement should at least provide proper replay protection before they do so as they can't expect all of us who didn't sign the agreement to just agree with the hard fork and move with them. How many people signed this agreement exactly? And do they speak for the entire community? I don't think so.

Yeah we'll be going up and down sometimes but if you look at a longer term chart it doesn't take a genius to see where the trend is going. We went from $600 to $5000 in less than a year so no shit we'll see a correction at some point, with a fast growing market like this also comes great volatility and big corrections along the way. You just see a bubble that's going to burst, while I just see waves in a rising tide that's slowly going to engulf and change the world. You may see that as delusional, but small minded people who don't understand new tech usually do. They've said it about computers, the internet and even electricity back then.

How is that funny? $100,000 per Bitcoin means a market cap of around 1.6 Trillion which is still peanuts compared to other assets like Gold for instance. If Bitcoin becomes successful as a widely recognized form of money then $100,000 is a very low estimate. Not going to happen next year obviously, but in the next 10 years I would say it's not that unlikely. If Bitcoin is worth any less then to me at least it's not valued high enough yet to be worth spending and I will keep my Bitcoin stash as a savings account only. YMMV

You can divide the seed in two and store them in two different places so it's harder for someone to find them both.

He means the big blockers have created Bcash now and we don't need Segwit2x anymore as a 'compromise' between those who want Segwit + 2nd layer solutions in order to scale while keeping the blocks relatively small and those who mainly want to scale onchain as quickly as possible through bigger blocks. The latter group can now find their sweet happy place in Bcash and hopefully stop buggering us for rushed hard forks we don't want or need.

You can only say this in hindsight. If things went differently you might have ended up with less BTC or watch the price go up from the sidelines. You don't have a crystal ball. As a hodler you just don't want or need this stress, you are confident in the future of Bitcoin and its long term value and thus you keep the coins in your own wallet and don't mess with exchanges except maybe for buying more on the dips. Sure you might not have the same confidence in Bitcoin's future as is apparent from your post, but that's why you're not a true hodler. Nothing wrong with that by the way, you're just living a different more cautious and conservative kind of lifestyle. But it's not wrong to just hold and ride out the waves either. I personally prefer the latter as history and personal experience has taught me I would have been much better off if I had just hodled my coins since the beginning. If you just started with Bitcoin or had a few lucky trades this might not seem to be the case for you, but time will often prove the HODL case to be best in the long run for 95% of people. The remaining 5% have a real knack for trading.
Of course Bitcoin could still fail and your cautious approach could have been the better strategy after all, but I will gladly take my chances on that. Bitcoin is about much more than just personal gains, it's about financial sovereignty and building a better monetary system for the entire world. With Bitcoin we take the power over money away from the banks and back into the hands of the people. This is why I HODL.

I don't have time to explain the technical details of how AB works, you can look it up on google if you're interested. The fact that AB makes miners more efficient power wise and that SW disables the use of covert AB is not under dispute. SW does not make the AB miners useless it just makes the covert use of AB impossible and therefore it loses its competitive advantage with SW. Overt use of AB is still possible with SW though so theoretically they could keep using it, but then everyone will see who's doing it. And since Bitmain is still denying using this method on mainnet despite the overwhelming circumstantial evidence I don't think they want to use the overt method.

The reason people hold is because while they think the price may go down more, they realize that they may be wrong and they don't want to risk being in a position where they sell and see the prize go back up and get left behind. I hold because I prefer my coins to sit safely on a hardware wallet instead of on an exchange. I don't buy more because I also need money to pay my bills and stuff, I am invested deep enough already. Also as a trader you need to think about risk management and position sizing, you can't just keep buying and averaging down forever. It may work for a while but if you did this @ $1200 back in 2013 you wouldn't be able to make money as a trader for years, if you didn't trade on margin and got margin called that is. Traders need to consider the possibility they are wrong and know when they are wrong, if you don't you will not do well in the long run as a trader.

No there hasn't, not one that is non-controversial. Segwit was the best upgrade by far to increase the blocksize and fix several other issues and pave the way for 2nd layer solutions. This is why it got consensus pretty quick among the technical community, even though some think 1MB blocksize is already putting too much centralizing pressure on the network. The main problem they see is that big blocks slow down block propagation over the network, which would benefit big miners and large mining pools leading to more centralization. You may agree or disagree, but fact is that this is a contentious issue so you can't just ignore that and hard fork anyway in the face of these kind of legit concerns. With further optimizations to the network and faster internet as time goes on a blocksize increase may be much safer to do and then these concerns will fade and a hard fork would not be so contentious any longer. So what's the rush here? It's okay to disagree but it's not okay to force a hard fork through without consensus.

The only way people will learn to not invest their money into scams is when they feel it in their own wallet. If you do stupid stuff life will punish you for it one way or the other and that's how you learn. You can't protect people from their own stupidity and greed, they need to feel the consequences of their mistakes themselves in order to learn and grow from them. 
The problem that Bitcoin is trying to fix is not greed or speculative nonsense, it's the fact that we the people have to suffer the consequences of the greed and speculative nonsense of a small rich elite. I don't care if the guy next door loses all his money on a scam, as long as I don't have the suffer the consequences for it and he gets to walk away free.

I don't, Bitcoin has gone from $400 in 2016 to $4500+ today, that's pretty damn good in my book. Sure Ethereum and some others have seen bigger gains, but I don't believe for one second that had anything to do with Bitcoin fees. It's just psychology, people see Bitcoin has rocketed and think they've missed the boat so they look for a cheaper alternative in the hopes of it doing the same thing Bitcoin did. And there you have the perfect recipe for an altcoin bubble. Not saying that all altcoins are worthless, but many of them are grossly overvalued right now imo.

I see, nitpicking words again taking them out of context. You must be someone who is very much focused on details and takes every word extremely literally. Let's quote the sentence again and now with context: "All the power rests with the users! Nobody can overrule them! **Backwards incompatible changes like hardforks are only possible with consensus; when literally everyone agrees. Otherwise it will just create another altcoin.**"
So OP is saying that miners and businesses can change the rules for themselves and mine a different chain, but if users do not play along these miners and businesses will find themselves disenfranchised and have now created an altcoin. Miners are just providing a service to the users and get paid for that by the users. They can decide to fight against us but it will only hurt their own business, it's better for them to get along well and stay on the consensus chain. Miners and businesses have no power to change the rules without our consent, but they do have the power to damage the price and cause some havoc. So OP is talking about two different kinds of power here. Got any more nitpicks?

Nice write-up, but one small correction:


ASICBOOST does not get extra hashing power out of the miners, it just makes them consume less power and thus makes them cheaper to operate leading to a competitive advantage. This would not be a problem were it not that the technology is patented and the tech is incompatible with certain protocol upgrades like Segwit.

Geez you can leave out that condescending tone of yours thank you. I don't know or care whether it is a global conspiracy, I tend to think it's simply driven by self-interest of the groups I mentioned. I don't see myself as a hero either, that's ridiculous. If it's up to the people most of them would certainly prefer money that doesn't lose its value over time, but if it's up to banks and governments they obviously prefer inflation. Nothing complicated about it and no need to come up with any conspiracy theories to try and explain why this is. Also no need to bring up economic fairy tales about why inflation is necessary for a healthy economy.
And I'm not saying we all have to move to Bitcoin now and leave fiat behind, I think it should be everyone's personal choice and I'm happy we actually have this choice now. This is the beginning of the separation of money and state and I'm choosing for Bitcoin. You and others can choose fiat if you like, this is what freedom means.

So maybe I should have said you're a short term speculator instead, if you're telling the truth that is. Either way you're missing the bigger picture here. I'm not a speculator, I'm in Bitcoin because I see it as a better form of money than what we currently have. I like being my own bank, not having to trust third parties to take care of my money or block me from access to it. Peer-to-peer economy is the future. I am not high on past success, I am well off financially already and don't really care much about the short term price of Bitcoin, I can ride these waves out no problem as I do not need to liquidate my coins any time soon or ever. Yes I've made a ton of money, but even if I hadn't it wouldn't change my position one bit. Bitcoin going to $100k+ is an inevitability if it becomes successful, that doesn't mean I believe it is guaranteed to be successful though. There's a pretty good chance I think, and I am trying to help and support it becoming successful as best I can.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:28:30


No they're not, the arguments against it make perfect sense from a technical and network security perspective. First of all it's rushed, you can't expect the entire ecosystem to update to different largely untested software within 3 months. It's reckless and unnecessary to push through a hard fork this quickly. Second there is no consensus for segwit2x, the NYA agreement was made between miner respresentatives that control 90% of hashpower through their mining pools (talking about mining centralization..) and a bunch of business people, no Core developers were onboard and the users have also been ignored completely. Sorry but that's a huge farce and there's no way the Bitcoin protocol rules can be changed this way, and if it can it is completely worthless as a system that is supposed to be decentralized.
And your claim that solutions like LN are years away is pure nonsense. I'm not against a moderate blocksize increase at all and I would be more than willing to support one after we've seen the effects of Segwit and we are able to better estimate what kind of increase would be safe to do. Then if we can get enough support from the community we might be able to plan a safe blocksize increase somewhere in 2019 perhaps, if other technological developments within Bitcoin haven't made this already unnecessary by then that is. If you care to make BTC as good as possible then it would be wise to not try and push through a rushed hard fork that is not supported by the many experienced developers that have helped bring Bitcoin where it is today.

Great reply! I agree with everything you've stated here, and I'll add that Segwit activation was delayed for over a year not by Core but by miners. Segwit achieves the same thing Classic wanted (increase to 2MB blocks) while at the same time fixing other long standing issues and paving the way for 2nd layer scaling solutions. To blame Core for the deadlock is very one sided and just wrong, we all need to share some responsibility for the division we have created. Yes, all of us. If we can do that we can all move forward together again, or part ways peacefully if we can't reconcile our differences.

You need to buy first before you can use it. And there's not much reason to use it yet, we're still in the early adoption phase and it needs to grow a lot before it becomes more stable and usable as a currency. Why spend Bitcoin when its value is expected to increase to over $100,000 if it becomes successful? I will spend fiat to buy stuff until then and only start using BTC when it reaches those values, that's what makes the most sense to me at least.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:04:05


LOL that's not gonna happen, we'll see who ends up at the right side of history. :)
By the way Core doesn't have the power to do the 'upgrade' to 2x either even if they wanted to, they also depend on user consensus. As it should be, no entity controls Bitcoin. And if they do Bitcoin is worthless anyway and I don't care about any upgrades.

This probably was his clarification: "I actually meant 'you' could get fed false data when trying to connect to it (remotely ). Many people obviously run nodes in cloud environments or connect their light wallets to their own home nodes."
So he means if you connect to your node remotely you are vulnerable to someone else sitting in the middle and feeding you false data from your node. Hard to believe this is a sincere argument being made against running your own full node, but there it is.

B2X looks like it will fail right now, but let's stay vigilant and not celebrate too early. It can still cause a bit of disruption without the replay protection.
The thing this proves is that miners and businesses alone don't have the power to change the protocol rules on us without the majority of us consenting. However what will happen when a majority of users do consent to a controversial change? You might say it's fine as long as you're on the side of the majority, but tyranny of the majority could be a real threat I think. I would love Bitcoin to only change when we have large consensus for it (90%+), but reality seems to be showing us that Bitcoin could change if just a 51% majority agree to it. What would have stopped B2X if the market valued B2X consistently higher than BTC? It's something to ponder on even though we seemed to have dodged a bullet this time. New attacks will come. Proper education may be our only weapon against this, but with a growing userbase this challenge won't become any easier.

I respect my ancestors quite a bit thank you very much, that doesn't mean I should refrain from criticizing the system and realize that we need something like Bitcoin to fix many of these flaws. I may sound harsh for noobs making mistakes, but I too have made some of these mistakes as a former noob and I am glad I was allowed to make these mistakes because they allowed me to learn from them and take responsibility for those mistakes. Mistakes are good for soul growth. People who actually know me know I am a very compassionate person and I always try to inform and help them the best I can and will try to prevent them making the same mistakes I have made. I do believe in personal responsibility and that we are all part of the solution, I just don't believe the government stepping in and banning stuff is.

Access to your bank account can be denied, or they can make it impossible for you to withdraw your money if they deem that necessary to prevent a bank run and 'save the economy'. Whenever I explain Bitcoin to people I simply tell them that with Bitcoin they don't need a bank to store their money or make transactions, they can do it directly from person to person just like with cash but electronically. People generally don't trust banks so the fact that with Bitcoin you can bypass the banks altogether sounds quite appealing to most.

The NYA was null and void right after Segwit activated and Bcash was created. It's silly to think the network can safely do a contentious hard fork in 2 months from now, it's not gonna happen. With or without replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:14:28


That's an assumption I wouldn't make, just because core devs have come to a consensus about something doesn't automatically make the user community come to the same consensus. It's true though that the opinion of core developers are taken very highly since they have the technical knowledge and expertise to code such a hard fork and understand the impact on the network. So if the developer community gives their okay it's pretty likely that the rest of the Bitcoin community will not challenge that. But that doesn't justify putting political pressure on the Core devs to agree with something they have technical and ideological objections against. You can't force consensus.


The miners had too high expectations of the deal, it's just not how this works in Bitcoin. They shouldn't blame the Core team for that, a decentralized open source system just isn't governed through roundtable deals. I also think mining being highly centralized in China made the entire miscommunication and misunderstanding worse, as there also seems to be somewhat of a culture gap at work here. And then there's ASICBOOST probably playing a role as well with the miners stalling Segwit activation for so long angering the community. This has caused division between the mining community and the Bitcoin user community which makes the NYA even more contentious than it already is.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:26:13
I think the HKA shouldn't have happened either, but at least in the HKA they agreed to only do the hard fork if it had broad support within the entire community as well. Avoiding a contentious hard fork is key here.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:51:10
Core doesn't control the bitcoin protocol either. They can't make changes to the protocol on their own, they can only try and deliver good proposals for changes and then seek consensus within the community. Many proposals from Core contributors have been rejected before. Core has never and will never try to push through a hard fork without community consensus like the 2x camp is trying to do. Even if 2x camp wins (whatever that means) they will not be in control either as they will soon find out afterwards.
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:08:06
Then you shouldn't do 2x in the first place if you don't want to fragment into smaller currencies. If there was strong consensus this wouldn't be a problem anyways since almost nobody would want use the minority chain and it would die off naturally.

Many polls have been done regarding segwit, it showed a large amount of support. Pretty much all of the technical guys agree that segwit is a great piece of tech, almost all of them! Ask them about a blocksize increase through a hard fork  and you get much more opposition. Most of them say we will need a further blocksize increase beyond segwit but this should be done after we have seen and properly analysed the effects of segwit on blocks and the network. And also a proper amount of time and preparation is needed to come to a consensus and test and update the software. Do you not see how this makes a lot of sense and that the double standard you see simply doesn't exist? Blocksize plays only a small part in the actual scaling of Bitcoin, the current obsession and impatience over it is unhealthy in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:12:02
Using the currency for transactions is not its primary use case right now, its current use case is more akin to gold. Bitcoin has to become bigger, more stable with improved scalability through multiple layer implementations first in order to become a good currency for transactions. Right now buying Bitcoin or helping build out the lightning network is the way to join this revolution, spending as a currency comes later.

It's not as easy as it looks to just switch to a new crypto as a community. Probability of splintering into many groups destroying community cohesion is very high. The market will eventually pick a new cryptofavorite I'm sure, but I think the odds of mainstream acceptance will then be low. I mean who guarantees your money will be safe in this new coin now that Bitcoin failed? It's a bad precedence and would give crypto as digital gold a very bad name. I will be sticking to Bitcoin and if it fails then I will be out of this market for good.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:10:45
You don't have to deal with exchanges at all, if you don't like Segwit you're free to not use it. Don't know why you wouldn't want to though, lower fees sounds quite attractive to me and besides that you won't even notice any difference at all as a user. Segwit also has much bigger consensus within the community, and it being backwards compatible makes a huge difference. As a hard fork I don't think Segwit would have succeeded. BTC-1 is pushing for a contentious hard fork, and there is hardly any peer review and open development being done there. It's not nearly as open as Core development is.

True. I've gone through several bubbles and subsequent bear markets and this one is pretty weak compared to the ones I've hodl'd through. It feels somewhat similar to the April-August 2013 bear market although that one was still a bit worse percentage wise. Price will have to drop to around $3.5k for it to be equal, and BTC recovered pretty quickly back then from such a 80%+ drop. Who knows how long it will take this time, but I have patience and seen much worse so I'm not worried at all.

If the first happens it will change absolutely nothing about my relationship with them, they know the risks and have invested money they can afford to lose.

Your comment made it easy to figure out what side is the real deception
I don't subscribe to villainizing certain people within the Bitcoin community, with the exception of perhaps Craig Wright as he seems to be a real conman. I do think most of these people like Gavin and also Erik Voorhees have good intentions but they have blind spots which prevents them from seeing the harm in things like 2X or other hard fork proposals that do not have consensus within the community. We need to stop pointing at the extremes from both sides who come up with all kinds of conspiracy theories and villainize valuable members within the community, and focus on a constructive debate instead. I am convinced that people like Gavin Andreses, Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver are good people who want the best for Bitcoin, just like Greg Maxwell, Adam Back, Charlie Lee and others who have spoken out against the 2x hard fork are. Let's just stop with the villainizing and ad hominem attacks, and also stop using them to justify your personal position in the debate. Wherever there are two camps disagreeing there will always be people attacking characters, just ignore them and look at the rational arguments for and against instead.

And that's supposed to impress me? Look buddy I've been here since early 2013 and have heard the same words ever since I bought my first coin at $100. People were laughing at me when price crashed to $50 screaming bubble and I just bought more and told them it would go to $1000+. Bitcoin could go below &lt;$2000 and I would be happy to buy some more at that level, I've been through much worse fluctuations in Bitcoin price before. You're just a noob thinking you are wiser than us who've been in this market a lot longer than you even know about crypto.

I don't think Adam is a hypocrite at all for signing the HKA while being against the NYA. The HKA did not try to ram a hard fork down all our throats, it aimed to do it with proper community consensus. Adam did not claim to speak for the entire Core team nor did he make any promises regarding the activation of a hard fork. I think Adam participated in the HKA to show some good will to the miners who had been complaining and improve communications, too bad it seemed to have the opposite effect. Still I think making decisions and signing agreements at a roundtable meeting with miners is not the way to go for an open source project.
The intentions of the NYA were also good in principle but the outcome was way worse with a contentious hard fork as a 'compromise' for Segwit activation. I think the NYA participants hoped that everyone would see the need for the compromise to get us out of the deadlock and move Bitcoin forward again. This wasn't the case however, Core devs clearly do not support it and a lot of users also do not see the benefit of a disruptive hard fork for only a small increase in max blocksize. Many are happy now that we have Segwit and we can move forward with 2nd layer tech and many other improvements. Still the 2x hard fork would not have been such a big issue had they implemented strong replay protection like BCH did.
TL;DR: HKA was different, no push for contentious hard fork. NYA is hostile in its attempt to force a contentious hard fork on all of us and replace the original chain without strong replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:14:35


Quoted the most relevant part of the agreement. Also there were only a few Core devs who signed the HKA, clearly they could not speak for the entire team.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:33:57


This is true, controversy can be artificially created like we saw with Segwit. But you could see pretty much all of the developers and other technical experts agreed segwit was a good upgrade and there weren't many serious arguments touted against it. The only point of contention I saw was that some thought upgrading to segwit via hard fork would be cleaner. I think with a very strong definition of consensus (everyone agrees) we will never have a successful hard fork, but with a too soft one we risk messy splits like we see with B2X or tyranny of the majority situations. It's something we are just going to need to figure out together and it will take some time.

Why would the regular user store their money inside a crypto that happens to be the market's favorite today but then lose its value tomorrow when everyone switches over to some other coin? If I can not trust Bitcoin to hold its value because of outside attacks or whatever then I am not likely to store my money in some other crypto instead because who assures me the same won't happen to this coin as well? If Bitcoin fails and another cryptocoin takes over my trust in crypto as digital gold and sound money is damaged beyond repair. The market will find a new favorite I'm sure but I believe the cryptomarket as a whole would decrease dramatically in overall value due to the loss of trust in them as being a store of value and alternative to bank money.

They have a mailing list and github repo, you see various Core developers contribute there by reviewing code and discussing things. If there's a good proposal (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) Core contributors can all openly discuss it and come to a consensus together about the BIP. It's not magic.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:55:05
I'm against the NYA proposal itself, it is just wrong on so many levels that if it succeeds and becomes the main Bitcoin chain I am afraid that I will have to pull a Mike Hearn. First you can't properly code, review, test and deploy a safe hard fork this quickly, we'd need more time to prepare the entire ecosystem to safely upgrade their software. Second the agreement was made in a backroom somewhere with a few rich people shaking hands in secret, without any of the current experienced Bitcoin developers being onboard. That is not how Bitcoin works or should work, this is how the current financial system works which is what we want to move away from.
I'm for increasing the block size in a timely, safe and responsible manner. Not like this, and I will fight tooth and nail to prevent the network to succumb to methods like this. It's too bad we have to spend so much energy fighting off attacks, but I guess we have to wade through this bullshit now to make the network more resilient against similar attacks in the future.

BIP148 is a bit of a special case. Core did not support BIP148, they thought it was too risky and didn't have enough support. I understand why a lot of people here supported it though, mainly because people were fed up with the miner blockade against Segwit while the community at large was eagerly awaiting its activation. Something simply had to be done against the gridlock or Bitcoin's progress would have been severely hampered. Notice how much marketshare Bitcoin lost during this gridlock, and how much it has gained back now that we have seen some progress with Segwit. Price action showed a clear indication that the community wanted to see Segwit activated.
Anyway whatever your opinion about BIP148 is, I think we can all agree that a contentious hard fork is not desirable right? Personally if I was in favor to do a certain hard fork upgrade, but it is clear there is no consensus and real risk of a messy chain split I would not like to see the hard fork pushed through regardless.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:20:31

Crypto is a global market, while the Chinese market is significant the world is much bigger than just China. Markets like Korea, Japan, India are growing very fast lately.

You should look at median transaction fees to get a more realistic picture of actual fees, many people are overpaying by a large amount. Personally the highest fee I have ever paid was $2 for a Bitcoin transaction. Not saying that everything is fine, but segwit should help quite a bit already in bringing the needed fees down. Also wallets should help by implementing better [fee estimation](

I think you have a very biased and generalized interpretation of libertarianism, it's not about selfish freedom at the cost of others. It's similar to the biased view some have of 'leftists', so you are accusing others of the very same thing you are doing yourself. This is why I never define myself as either being left or right, or even libertarian, because it leads to people interpreting my morals and values in a way that doesn't fit with the way I actually view things. I just do not believe in a centrally planned economy and states interfering with markets.

False. I am also buying Bitcoin for the benefit it has for humanity as a whole. If I saw no benefit for humanity I would never have bought it, I would have bought stocks or other lower risk investments instead.

The last one is a personal benefit as well, I do like being in control of my own money.

The HKA was very different from NYA. The HKA specifically states that the hard fork proposal that would be written by the involved Core devs would only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community. Also the involved Core devs made it clear they could not speak for the entire Core team and were only speaking on behalf of themselves. The NYA on the other hand never even involved any Core devs at all and also doesn't care about seeking broad support within the community either. This makes the NYA effectively a corporate takeover and thus very different from the HKA.

It can't be used like this (yet) because it would quickly make running full nodes very expensive making the network more centralized and less secure as a result. It uses to be possible during a time when Bitcoin was much less popular and therefore you didn't have to pay much fees. Just like altcoins now.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:09:04


The HKA was not an agreement to do a hard fork at a specific date, there were I believe only 2 Core devs there who signed the agreement that they would code a hard fork proposal if miners would signal and activate Segwit. In no way shape or form did these two Core devs speak for the entire Core team nor did they agree to force a hard fork through without first seeking community consensus on it. The HKA was very very different from the NYA.

No they're not right. The OP talked about investing only a small amount, the risk may be high but the potential reward is absolutely mind blowing huge. All investments carry risk, but not all investments have this kind of potential so investing a relatively small amount absolutely makes sense.

Cumulative work is not reasonable, especially not without a timeframe specified. What if it flip-flops? Or what if miners collude and eat a short term loss in order to get B2X recognized as the true Bitcoin by this definition?

Our current system doesn't really allow most people to save up enough money to buy a house without going into debt or waiting for 30 years. With a better form of money like Bitcoin it would take much less time though. Gold is better than fiat but still you don't really own it unless you have it physically which is a lot less convenient than owning Bitcoin instead. With Bitcoin you are in complete control of your own money which combined with it being a deflationary asset makes it perfect for me. It's also young and has much more potential for growth, albeit also more volatile due to this. I don't think it's for everyone right now, but as it grows and develops and becomes more stable it will become more attractive for more people I believe. I never recommend other people to put their entire savings in it, but a small percentage isn't a bad thing. I put in a lot more but that's because it's my passion and my work.


Sure I invest into projects I find valuable like Lightning, is there any reason why you're assuming I just sit on my coins and do nothing with them? I certainly will not spend my coins to buy silly things with it, but sure I use some of it for investing purposes. I don't shame people who just hold onto their coins though, I think that's a perfectly legitimate use case. By holding onto your coins you are adding human value to the network and make it a little bit bigger. Just by doing that you already support the entire project and help it grow. Not everyone is a builder or good at investing (look at how many people invest in scammy ICOs), and that's perfectly fine.




Bitcoin is great for saving, right now however it's not very good for spending. As Lightning develops more and becomes more popular this will change in the future, but right now the blockchain simply doesn't scale well enough for it to become popular as a payment option. It's serving its function quite well as a superior digital version of Gold, and in the future I see it becoming more popular as a digital version of Cash as well. For now I'm in hodl mode as Bitcoin has some more growing up to do first. I'm not going to participate in helping clog up the network and pay outrageous fees by spending my coins everywhere. I don't care if that bothers you, my reasons are my own.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:11:28


Because savings at some point are going to be used for something. I am not saving money in order to die with it, I might want to buy a house with it for example or start a business. I am still going to keep holding the rest and continue saving in bitcoin. I am not interested in old-world money gold or index trackers, I am interested in bitcoin as a potential world changer.


It has much much more potential than just being a new way of saving, it is a world changer and I'm here to help it come true. I certainly would not complain about speculative gains but after 5+ years in bitcoin I am already way too spoiled in that department so that's not the reason why I'm still so interested in it. I could cash out now and retire for the rest of my life, but I find that utterly boring.

But it did! They used their bitcoin to buy a lambo and now have no money left. Pretty darn good lesson from bitcoin there if you ask me, if they haven't learned from that by now then nothing will ever teach them.


And only 0.1% are actually good at it using the legacy fiat money system, and that's because it teaches people to spend their money as quickly as possible and punishes saving. Bitcoin is a brand new asset class that is going to be the money of the future, a kind of money that is actually a decent store of value and that encourages saving instead of punishing it. Money isn't meant to generate value itself, it's a way to keep track of things we own and exchange with each other. And Bitcoin does this in a way that's revolutionary and that makes it very valuable.


I'm currently using bitcoin for saving and fiat for spending because that's the cheapest and easiest way for me. That doesn't mean this is how it will be forever, I expect this to change when bitcoin has matured more. Other deflationary assets are not as liquid and convenient for me, and also are not nearly as exciting.

Erik Voorhees makes a problematic statement here, implying that a fork only needs to gain a majority to be called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not ruled by a majority, it is ruled by consensus. If all it takes is a 51% majority for the consensus rules to change, Bitcoin would become extremely vulnerable to political attacks and we can no longer trust the code itself and consensus. In the future when Bitcoin becomes more mainstream I would imagine a media and political campaign could easily sway public opinion to increase the 21M coin limit, and Erik Voorhees would be fine with this if only 51% would agree. Sad to see that Erik still doesn't understand Bitcoin and supports contentious hard forks.

The bad foreign policy of mainly the US in the past couple decades has been a great breeding ground for this kind of terrorism to evolve, so as to the origin you don't have to look much further I think. They've also been funded by the US and some European countries themselves which of course added even more fuel to the fire.

Blocklimit increase can never be a solution to scaling, it just can't. You must know that already if you actually understand the issue. Segwit + LN look very promising and there is no reason not to try and work with these solutions. It's not just the leading Core devs who call Segwit good tech and an important step forwards for Bitcoin, people like Andreas Antonopoulos whom you quoted and Nick Szabo and many others also are saying the same thing.

They didn't ignore it, the risks and trade-offs for short term onchain scaling were deemed to be way too high for the minor benefits it would provide. The compromise was a doubling of the blocksize with Segwit, more than that was not deemed safe for now. I think it's a very good thing Bitcoin is a collaborative effort and decisions can't be made by just one or two people who may have a huge blind spot like Gavin. Whether you agreed with him or not.

No it's not. Bitcoin is NOT a democracy. People can create their own altcoin if they don't like the current consensus rules of Bitcoin. You can hard fork all you want, but if there is no wide consensus that the fork is necessary the fork can never be Bitcoin. Ever heard of tyranny of the majority? That's what's going to happen if a small majority can decide on new rules, and it would completely destroy the trust people have in the code and immutability of the blockchain. This is why a hard fork requires pretty much the entire ecosystem to agree, not just a small majority. I admit this is my biggest worry about Bitcoin's longevity at the moment, but as of now I still believe that we could thwart such a 51% attack. But such an attack is going to happen at some point I'm sure, Bcash was just the first test.

Segwit is needed for many other reasons besides increasing transaction throughput, like bringing in Lightning Network, fixing malleabililty and quadratic hashing scaling.

The compromise can't happen. It's just not possible to promise a HF 12 months after SegWit. I would personally love to see it happen but at the same time I can see it's just not realistic to find consensus for this. The best we can do is do our utmost best to find a good HF proposal for a blocksize limit increase that can get consensus after SegWit has gone active. The data we get from bigger blocksizes after SegWit is implemented will also allow us to better estimate what kind of increase will be safe to do in the near future. SegWit through either UASF or MASF is imo the only realistic way forward.

I don't know what most people are doing with bitcoin and I think it is their own business, right now we're still in the early stages so it makes perfect sense to hodl. Time will teach people exactly what they need. Plenty of people sold after the bubble in 2013 and then bought a 'lambo' and now are out of money and coins. Others took some profits, invested in their own education and wealth generation and now as a result have more money and more coins. At some point you realize you know the drill and have plenty of wealth already, and start caring about teaching other people the same thing. Still it all starts with teaching how to save your money first and how to spend it wisely, which the legacy fiat money system fails very hard at.

1Mb, 2Mb or even 100Mb will make absolutely no difference, it's still way too small for it to become a true global currency. That's why 2nd layer solutions are important and all focus has to go into that direction. On-chain scaling is also important and has to happen eventually but it's clear that right now we need to focus all our energy on paving the way for 2nd layer protocols and get them working and integrated with Bitcoin. The 1Mb limit is not the actual bottleneck for global adoption right now, if you believe that you don't understand how it works.

They are forking off from BTC and will effectively create an altcoin called Bitcoin Cash. It doesn't matter how much hashpower they get, they can't undo transactions from the Segwit chain when they are busy mining and building blocks on their own separate chain.

Why is Litecoin uninteresting technically? I thought it was pretty much a Bitcoin clone only with faster block times and a few more minor differences. Is it really that different?

Increasing the blocksize limit is not a real scaling solution, you know that do you? Even 100MB blocks will not be nearly enough to satisfy global demand, and those blocks would completely centralize Bitcoin. I also have a lot of skin in the game and I am very much in favor of SegWit and LN, I see no reason why LN would not work. And if it doesn't work a limit increase is still not a good alternative solution. A moderate increase would be nice after SegWit and LN are implemented successfully, but not earlier than that.

It's contentious because it is rushed, and it is not needed right now since Segwit already delivers some onchain scaling without needing a risky and disruptive hard fork.

BCC can't revert any BTC transactions, they fork off at August 1st and will try to go their own way. They are free to do so.

All this will not affect the activation of Segwit on BTC. If you want to try and sell your BCC though it would be wise not to do any BTC transactions until you've sold the BCC after August 1st.

I wouldn't be confident in saying that 2 chains could not survive in Bitcoin because of longer block times. If there is demand for something in the market and the fork is not being carried by a wide consensus then the minority chain will be very likely to survive. If a community gets behind it they will find a way, either by waiting out a few difficulty adjustments or by changing the PoW algorithm. If there's one thing we can learn from the Ethereum fork is there are always unforeseen risks and consequences.

I can see and understand the value of Bitcoin, so I'm personally invested in it and support it. I can not say the same thing for ETH however, and I can't really support something I don't trust or understand well enough. Why should ETH tokens have value exactly? I have no idea. And ETH is planning to switch to PoS eventually, is that even a good idea? And what about the DAO and the hard fork? I will not touch ETH with a 10ft pole right now. This could change though, but for now I do not see its value. Bitcoin is where it's at right now, and I believe that only after BTC has truly broken through and crossed the chasm that perhaps a few other cryptocurrencies will have a chance too.

You don't have a global community and lots of money behind your fork, so your fork is not a problem. A minority chain as a result of a contentious hard fork is a whole different matter and will be an issue.


Not willing to do a controversial hard fork does not mean inaction, there are lots of things being done in regards to scaling and improving the network.

Increasing the block size is a good idea and will happen in time, after other network improvements have been made that will allow Bitcoin to scale better. The only thing that's not a good idea is to rush it or see it as the holy grail of Bitcoin scaling, as increasing the block size is not a real solution to scaling. SegWit can already increase the 7 TPS limit to 12-14 TPS, and with a moderate increase of the block size you can increase this a bit further but other solutions like Lightning have to be implemented in order to scale in any real meaningful way. So we need patience to do things the right way, and this is something CB doesn't seem to have.

We don't need a stinking hard fork forced down our throats right now.

Why are people downvoting my comment? Saying mtgox was hacked by malleability is just plain wrong. Come on reddit.

Only time my transaction wasn't accepted with 0 conf was when I paid less than 40 satoshi/byte fee on the transaction. So if you use Mycelium make sure to use high priority fee as normal priority only uses 23 satoshi/byte. High priority uses 100 satoshi/byte which is overkill but sadly I can't choose 40-50 satoshi/byte using Mycelium. :(

Bits is easily the best sounding name for a unit of a currency like Bitcoin, even Grim Dawn has an ingame currency that are called Bits when you pick them up. Sounds way better than milliBitcoin or something like that.

Controversion around Segwit is largely fake and drummed up, there is overwhelming support for it within the community. Bitcoin adversaries and competitors have created a false controversy around it through sock puppetry and such in order to try and stall any progress of the Bitcoin protocol towards scaling, privacy and fungibility. They will fail and we will get Segwit.

Don't forget the fact that Dash is governed by a plutocratic democratic voting system. They think they've solved scaling because they decided to just up the blocksize to 400MB+ if necessary lol.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:29:45


Come on now don't be stupid. The networks that have adopted Segwit don't have full blocks and very low fees already so how could they even see benefit from this? Segwit has way more support in the community than other scaling options on the table right now, so I don't see why we should continue stalling or hoping for some other magical solution. I do know why Jihan wants to continue stalling though.

We've got a true believer here lol. Personally I don't care who Satoshi is, we are basically all Satoshi in my eyes. I don't like this whole personality worshiping, feels creepy cultish to me.

There are almost 2 months left, plenty of time to gather more hash power behind BIP148. Don't judge too soon. It's better to activate Segwit on August 1st than sit another whole year doing nothing but fighting over what should be done..

$3 USD is nothing, maybe if you keep $20 worth of Bitcoin on an exchange $3 is a lot. I removed 5 BTC from an exchange into my Trezor today and gladly paid the small fee for it.

Just count the number of unbanked people in the world and add to that all the people who want to buy their coffee with Bitcoin and you don't need math to see that we'd need huge blocks in order to accommodate that kind of demand. It will never be enough. We need Segwit and Lightning afterwards to offload the bulk of transactions offchain which then are settled onchain. A hard fork to 2MB or 4MB will not solve anything at all. And segwit as HF is also not a better solution as has been discussed to death already.

Do you even Bitcoin bro? Pretty much every single word is wrong in this article. Read the first comment below that article.

Then you were lucky I guess, the lowest mycelium fee is only 8 satoshi/byte and could get your transaction stuck for a long time during busy times. I used normal priority once with Steam and it took 3 hours to get the money into my Steam wallet, with high priority it was instant for me.

How is Litecoin innovative?
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:59:04


Short term problems, at least if we can stop arguing about silly stuff and just implement Segwit and Lightning soon. You can't do all these things onchain, we'd need 1GB+ blocks to support that and that's technically impossible and also would lead to complete centralization of the network.

BIP148 aims to activate SegWit which the community at large has been waiting for for more than a year now, it should not be contentious or split the chain if miners play along. Users have simply run out of patience with all the stalling and political rhetoric. Desperate times require desperate measures. Though August 1st feels a bit rushed to me, if this deadline will accomplish the ecosystem as a whole to finally get their act together and upgrade the protocol with Segwit (either through Segwit2x, BIP141 or BIP148) I think it has all been more than worth it.

I find it crazy how exchanges still don't support sending to and receiving from bech32 segwit addresses. Bech32 should be the standard already as it is native segwit and saves the most in fees. When the next bullrun comes we really need everyone using bech32 addresses as well as the lightning network to prevent fees getting out of hand again. But if exchanges don't support it first this will not happen.

Or maybe you just lack a sense of humor? It's just an appreciation of the work he is doing for the Bitcoin community. You making it into hero worship or idealization is a bit over the top. Maybe you don't like the picture, but that's a matter of personal taste.
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:02:24


It makes little sense for a miner to keep mining at a loss in the hopes that the exchange rate goes up, because in that case buying BTC directly instead of mining them would be a better choice. The only way mining would still make sense in this case is if buying BTC directly is too hard for the person or if the person doesn't want to for some reason.

It's a typo, they meant July 31st obviously.

I am not saying it's Jihan vs the world, I am just saying he is incentivized to continue stalling and blocking Segwit. How is that stupid? And it's not economics vs coders either, that's a false dichotomy. It's far more than just coders who support and want Segwit. I have actually not heard any decent arguments against Segwit at all, and most of the experts I know have spoken in favor of it. And you're the one who came up with the argument that Segwit has no benefits because the other blockchains that adopted Segwit has seen no benefits so far, which only shows how ignorant you actually are about this amazing piece of tech. Before criticizing something you should at least understand what you are talking about. Segwit is not complicated at all and solves multiple issues as well as allows true scaling solutions to be implemented instead of applying small bandaids like a simple blocksize limit increase that requires a backwards incompatible hard fork and also bloats the blockchain further and makes it harder for the simple not so rich user to run a full node. 
This whole 'controversy' around Segwit is largely manufactured, and I believe this is done to hold back Bitcoin development so it won't be able to scale and upgrade. Make people distrust the current highly competent coders and replace them with incompetent ones, then centralize the network through the creation of huge blocks and making full nodes almost impossible to run by the normal user, and voila central banking is back in Bitcoin. No thanks I will fight until the end to not allow this to happen.

At least people have a choice here then. I think plenty of people don't want to bear the responsibility of keeping their own private keys safe. Maybe someone wants to store 50% safe at a bank, and the other 50% they want to store themselves in case the bank screws them over at some point.

I would recommend GreenBits for Android, it supports segwit and is a decent wallet.

Craig Wright is just another person like you and me, and I try to look at the things he is saying objectively. Have you actually heard or read the things he said and claims? It's completely ridiculous and sounds pretty antithetical to what Bitcoin stands for in my opinion. I can't believe how people can take this guy seriously. He is definitely not Satoshi that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:54:47
The scaling issue was never swept under the rug. Devs have been superbusy coming up with solutions like Segwit, schnorr, Lightning Network, MAST, etcetera. Increasing the blocksize is probably the worst and most inefficient way to scale, besides the many downsides of big blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:52:46
Nothing wrong with using a different method to activate a soft fork the large majority wants but is being blocked by miners. People make too much drama over something that is in essence pretty simple and straightforward. UASF let's do it.
