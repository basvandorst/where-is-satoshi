wow that was surprisingly fair and balanced!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:31
I tried this once, its extremely nerve wracking especially when you have to rely on exchanges that have been seeing record high traffic. The thought of doubling my bitcoin is lucrative but the thought of halving it is more terrifying.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:05
How does it make you feel that I bought at $1800? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:30
these thousand dollar price swings are going to give me a heart attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:32
I'll leave for a little but always come back, like an abusive relationship. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:17:11
You reap what you sow, no one in bitcoin would have ever advised you to make a move like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:59
The 3000's were a bitch to get through glad it payed off for you as well! I'm a little sad my 1000% profit margin is gone but I think I'll be ok 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:21:50
fair point, it would have to drop enormously for me to lose any fiat I put in so I suppose for some that bought today $16000 might be tanking. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:36:18
good for you

Bittrex is one of the few exchanges that trades it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:18:24
If bitcoin goes up 50% your $1,000 increases 50%. If bitcoin drops 50% your $1,000 drops 50%. Don't overthink it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:30:37
Right now? For sure no. The only reason i'm still in is because it would take a 90% dip for me to lose my initial investment. My plan was to hold for years and I did not expect it to take off like this in less than a year, its too exciting to cash out with the amount of attention and growth that's happened the past week.

@_date: 2017-12-09 01:16:40
my initial investment was about 10% but with the price skyrocketing its more like 75% now

so many opportunity's to be had, check out funfair that's my second largest investment after bitcoin. Trustless gambling with game odds and payouts all done on the blockchain, don't have to worry about the games being rigged to the house and it hasn't even gone to alpha yet. Just my suggestion do your own research.

I've been in less than a year and even I know this ain't shit, if it crashes it will be faster than you could sell and the exchanges will crash with it.

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:02
The price of bitcoin is where  I thought it would be 2-3 years from now. My initial plan was to hold for years but if I cashed out now I would make close to a years salary, that's not life changing money but it would be really nice to have. If I sold I would feel empty and don't think I could forgive myself. Even with a 75% drop from current price my initial investment would still be safe so I'm thinking I'll let it ride for a few more years and enjoy the ride.

I was expecting a comment like this from an old timer lol, i'm one of the people who came in around $1800 back in April. This sub helped me learn alot about bitcoin but I came in already understanding the fundamentals, now its just muddying my decisions and making me nervous. If I did not look at this sub I would not even be worried about futures trading...maybe its time to take a break.   
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:06:49
the price is not tanking, its up 3k since yesterday
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:10:41
Thanks for the help, I have to wipe my trezor to get a new seed and im assuming that would wipe the BCH with it. I'm just going to leave my BTC on coinbase for tonight and figure out how to get my BCH off my trezor and get rid of it tommorow. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:23:21
Look into exchanges, a few of the bigger ones are Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini. Any exchange will have a long verification process before you are allowed to exchange fiat for crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:46:50
If sha256 is cracked, would the person or entity who cracks it be able to access everyone's bitcoin?   
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:11:03
"Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of."
Fiat would be the US dollar the British pound etc. Exchanges like coinbase allow you to buy Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies with fiat currency. No offence but you should really do some more research on bitcoin if you don't already know what fiat and crypto are. There are some helpful links on the sidebar or you can just google how does bitcoin work. I like to give advice because alot of people in this sub can be dicks but you really need to get some base knowledge before you start any kind of serious trading. 
If you have anymore specific questions I will do my best to answer them 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:51:56
Ok, I lost my seed for my Trezor and need to move my BTC somewhere temporarily so I can wipe it and get a new one. As long as my bitcoin was on my Trezor at the time of the fork the other coin stays on my Trezor if I understand this correctly. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:03:28
I should be excited but instead I'm scared. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:29:45
maybe try explaining why investing in bitcoin is a good idea instead of simply saying "buy bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:13:08
But what if I can get 25% off tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:38:04
I lost the old seed, stupidly I only had it stored in one spot. The house I rent is being updated and alot of stuff has been moved around as well as a few workers coming in and out so when my seed was not where I thought it was I immediately moved my coins off the Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:32:02
I moved $5000 worth of bitcoin last week and it cost me $0.75
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:22:49
I have doubled my investment in less than 4 months, I thought it would take a year and that was my optimistic outlook. My gut says sell but my brain says HODL and see what the moon is like. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:35:50
This is a great video that explains how bitcoin works, once i learned how it works it really helped me see what truly drives the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:49:05
So even though I only see BTC in my trezor at the moment even though I kept my BTC stored on it through the split, If I send my BTC to coinbase then the other coin stays on my trezor even though I can't see it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:29:51
sign up for an exchange like coinbase or kraken, you can sell your bitcoin instantly as long as you have it on the exchange and not in a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:53:06
Once the price of one bitcoin hits $880,952 bitcoin's market cap would be roughly equal to the GDP of the USA which is about $18,500,000,000,000 (trillion) Then i think we will be mainstream.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:31:21
I lost the seed for my trezor and I need to transfer my coins to coinbase so I can wipe it and generate a new seed. If I have not split my Bcash yet will Coinbase take it from me when I transfer to their wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:50:48
I bought at 1800 this kind of money is a pretty big deal for me. I don't plan on selling anytime soon.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:02:53
My 85 year old grandpa would never give his debit card number to a "phishing" email. Just like people know to protect their credit card number, social security number, bank account number, they will learn to protect their private keys, seeds, exchange passwords, etc.

Could you elaborate on this? I bought my mom some bitcoin and had her put it on a breadwallet, I have been trying to figure out how to get it to an exchange so i can sell it and get her more bitcoin but I don't want to lose her BTC. I tried googling and all i can find are articles saying breadwallet is going to add a tool to send BCH but it does not exist on the app. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:05:59
So. Fucking. DANK. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:12:34
know what? the price?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:24:31
Make a coinbase account and set up weekly buys for what you spend on scratchoffs. Skip a night out and put the $50 you would spend into bitcoin instead. Once the CME group starts futures trading traditional investors will start dipping their toes in and you still have a chance to be an early adopter. 
For what its worth I downloaded a bitcoin wallet onto my phone back in 2013 when I first heard about it but I was young and realized I needed a debit card to buy and did not want to go through the trouble, then I hear about it this year and i already knew the basics about it so i jumped in headfirst and 1800 was a tough hurdle to jump too with the wannacry ransomware attack giving bad press and it was after a large runup from $1000. 
If you are going to gamble do it on bitcoin not on scratch offs. 
Once you learn bitcoin that opens up avenues to all the other crypto currencies and there is alot of money to be made there and also alot of money to be lost. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:58:30
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:31:18
you should take a look at the market cap lol
edit: nevermind you mean bitcoin market cap not crypto market cap
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:07:31
Its a financial tool. Imagine being in a country like Venezuela their currency plummets so you buy things of that will hold their value like jewelry for example. Things get worse and you try to escape the country but get stopped by corrupt government officals and shaken down for what you have with you. With bitcoin you can put it in a wallet, memorize a 12 word seed phrase in your head, leave the country and safely recover your finances on a new phone or computer. What you see is the first world use of a country that has centralized banks and a currency that is somewhat stable. There are tons of ways to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:32:36
I made a snide comment sure, was not making any attempt at an analysis.....maybe try not being bitter. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:55:09
someone walk me through how to get my BCH off a breadwallet so i can dump it please. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:56:12
ITS AT EXACTLY 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:44:20
If it crashes to $500 then buying probably won't be a good idea 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:47:20
At the moment that is true, it is an unstable currency in its infancy, and it is not ready for widespread adoption yet. The network could not even process enough transactions for people to be making everyday purchases with the current number of users. 
I think as more people adopt bitcoin it will be sink or swim and the necessary changes will be implemented or they won't be and maybe a new crypto will take its place. If it does get to the point of widespread adoption then the volatility we see now would no longer be an issue. There might be price fluctuations same as there are with the US dollar but with bitcoin it would be deflationary instead of inflationary. Putting everything else aside there is no denying that the Blockchain technology that bitcoin pioneered has the ability to fundamentally change what money is and make banking obsolete because it is a trustless system. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:34:46
You are describing me exactly, I started my coinbase account this year and bought some for my mom at $2000. If she wants to sell shes not going to be doing it on my account unless its an emergency. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:52:41
wrong thread lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:01:49
1 bitcoin is now worth $9000 but a single bitcoin can be broken up into 100,000,000 different pieces called satoshi's. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:15:24
Thats really tough, It took a huge leap of faith for me to get in. For what its worth there is still shitloads of room for growth and lots of other crypto currencies with the potential to see exponential growth. Litecoin for example which is about $90 now has the potential to be $1000 in a year or 2.
you still have the opportunity to be an early adopter. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:11:08
I hope you have been holding the whole time, congrats on being such an early adopter. I feel lucky for getting in when i did but still envy people who have been in as long as you have!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:10:01
I talked her into wanting to buy them. It was her decision, and an amount she could spare without making an impact if it crashed. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:55:14
let it ride, people with deep pockets will be wanting to buy that from you soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:02:33
Crazy to think just 3 months ago I was posting screen shots at $4000 and 3 months before that I bought my first bitcoin at $1800. What a difference this has made for me. 
Edit: A mental difference, I have not done any profit taking. This has changed my perspective of what money is and given me hope for my future years from now. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:17:32
I mean at least it was just nonsense and not spreading FUD
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:45:08
I just watched bitcoin jump $500 in 10 minutes, I'm not selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:07:08
I recommend Coinbase its the most user friendly, you will have to give them all your info and they will only let you start out buying small amounts and as you buy more you will be able to increase the amount you buy each time. 
Once you have bitcoin you can let it stay on your coinbase wallet or look into downloading an app called breadwallet onto your smartphone that way you would have full control over your bitcoin and coinbase would not be responsible for it. But you should bridge that gap when you come to it. If you have any other specific questions let me know but I highly recommend doing a bit of research first.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:22:47
Forget futures trading from the CME group, this meme is what will push bitcoin mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:57:03
The wand hasn't even been dipped in the soap solution yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:34:11
Depends on the crypto, Bitcoin has pretty much shaken that image because there are other coins that are better for that kind of stuff. 
The CME group is going to start offering Bitcoin futures trading along with their other futures and this will only legitimize it further. They do around a quadrillion dollars worth of trading every year. They would not associate their name which is worth so much with something that is only a tool for illegal activity the way you make it out to be. 
Honestly what you said is just flat out ignorant. Bitcoin is not private. In fact a benefit of bitcoin, if it were more widely adopted, would be the ability to track a donation you make to a nonprofit group on the blockchain to see where they are spending it. Seriously your either misinformed or don't know much about it and are jumping to conclusions. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:52:48
Awesome! Thanks alot, that was way harder to find than it should have been
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:51:28
I have had a whole bitcoin sitting in mine for the past 3 months and I'm not worried about it. In the long run though its better to have your own wallet that way your the only one responsible for your bitcoin. Its extremely unlikey but coinbase could be hacked and your bitcoin stolen, similar to how large stores like target get hacked because they have your info in their system. Having your bitcoin in your actual possession would make that scenario impossible.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:58:47
If you sent it to the wrong address then its over, nothing can be done. Sorry to break the bad news. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:04:10
It may simply become a deflationary store of value like gold i still don't think that would mean the current price is overvalued. The CME group which is a huge financial institution is going to be offering bitcoin futures contracts soon, and the CEO has also said that bitcoin could become its own asset class, no matter what it becomes I think the short term is looking very good and i think there are enough of us brainwashed supporters ;) that whatever issues need to be overcome in the future we will make it happen. 
Also here is the press release from the CME Group if you are interested.
 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:50:21
If you forgot about for that long forget about it for awhile longer and you might come back to 2-5k 
CME Group a huge financial institution is going to be offering bitcoin futures contracts soon and this will give traditional investors a way to dip their toes in from a trusted source. It will also bring more attention and legitimacy to bitcoin. 
If i were you just let it ride unless you need it to keep a roof over your head. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:24:46

Cite your source for that quote please 
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:23:44
I meant in the short term, and thats not what I was thinking at the time I bought but at the time the price dropped $200 the next day. Why do you care?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:05:50
Yeah that is enough, thats the bottom line of why I finally invested. News that bitcoin was reaching all time highs got into my news bubble. Now that im learning more about it, its easy to see that even though its reached all time highs there is more room for growth and that makes me optimistic.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:52:21
I bought a whole bitcoin at 1800 after doing little to no research, I just yolo'd that shit. Doing my research after the fact im actually really happy bitcoin is having such major issues. It just shows there is a shitload of room for the price to go higher once they are solved.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:58:17
Be careful getting caught up in the price surge, I did last week and bought at $1800, the next day it corrected to $1650. Today is the first day the price has consistently stayed above what I bought at and if I stayed patient I would have $150 more right now, or the price could have kept going up and I would regret not buying. I'm just sharing my experience not telling you whether to wait or not.  
Personally I am not expecting it to stay above 1800 but that is based on nothing whatsoever, simply my habit of tempering my expectations to be let down. Don't base your purchase off of anyone simply telling you "yes" if you ask "should I buy?"  
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:09:47
Im a coinbase noob too, the best way I can find is go to tools then history. It won't calculate how much $ you have made but you can see how much USD you paid and how much Bitcoin was at the time of purchase.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:08:32
hopefully by the end of the day.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:35:38
I'm sorry about that, I have a quick question because I have a little bit on coinbase but have not set up a personal wallet yet. Did you have the 2 step verification with your phone number set up?
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:41:48
calling bullshit on this
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:24:24
Im one of those, I bought 1.5 bitcoin between 1600 and 1800. I was tempted to sell when it got to 2800 because I would have made a months pay in 2 weeks from nothing but I was at work and once it started crashing I was not about to sell, because what if it rebounds. 
Anyway at this point im just gonna hodl and hopefully the price bottoms out and starts going back up.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:51:06

Your just wrong thats all there is to it. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:34:20
The price seems to be hovering around $2000 which is still $500 more than it was 3 months ago.  Also when Bitcoin dropped the entire market went with it. I would be worried if Bitcoin was down this much but everything else was green. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:06:32
Sure that's the other possibility. But I have been hearing about bitcoin since 2013 and regret not buying earlier. If it does go down again I'm planning on going down with the ship, I don't want to miss out again.

@_date: 2017-07-22 20:59:44
a paper wallet could be compared to a cash wallet, but a hardware wallet has a user created pin number that needs to be given before accessing the bitcoin stored on it. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:05:44
What you said was wrong. A bitcoin wallet is not like any other wallet. I have my bitcoins stored on a Trezor so I am credible. I could leave my Trezor at a restaurant and no one could get my bitcoins. You sit around on reddit and just leave condescending and pointless comments for hours a day. Your on a bullshit streak right now.

@_date: 2017-07-22 21:45:41
My point is that you made a shitty point by comparing a cash wallet's security to a bitcoin wallet's security. I could memorize my pin and my seed words and no one but me could ever access my bitcoin even if they had my physical hardware wallet, can't really say the same about a wallet with cash in it. 
 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:01:12
I heard someone say "If you have $100 worth of bitcoin put $100 worth of thought into securing it. If you have $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin put $1,000,000 worth of thought into securing it." 
I'm a rather small fish so a single hardware wallet was perfect for me. I was looking for a short term solution before August 1st so i'm not too familiar with any security issues the Trezor has. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:44:48
just put my coins on a trezor last night. Its extremely easy! I only have bitcoin but I know it takes Ethereum and Litecoin maybe a few others. 
This video shows the the whole settup process and how easy it is.

I'm copy pasting this comment credit goes to u/Ghostofcockroach
"This subreddit can be very harsh to newbies. I don't think we ever have a thread stickied to explain the current situation. And i must admit the learning curve is very steep. I honestly believe explaining bitcoin to newbies is crucial for world wide bitcoin adaptation, no? So why the hell do we keep op frustrated by not answering him? OK 
OP, I'll try to answer some of it for you.. but I'll be upfront. I don't really understand segwit and asicboost. But i know their purposes. Firstly, you have to understand what blockchain is. Put it simply blockchain is a ledger that keeps track of everyone's bitcoin by listing down transactions. 
Imagine there's a standard form used by everyone in order to send money from a to b. The form is the block. The stack of that form in chronological order is the blockchain. But there are so much more to that. Every person that runs a bitcoin node will keep record of this block chain. And they can also post a block to add to the chain. These changes will propragate in the network so that eventually all nodes will have the same block chain. This raise an issue, how do we validate transaction and how do we resolve timing issues? 
There are millions of node running. This is certainly a major issue if they all try to post at the same time. The easier solution would be to run a central server that governs the transaction timing and make a queue. But this would ruin the decentralization aspect of bitcoin. So the solution must be something that could be used without a central server. This is where mining comes along. Bitcoin is designed so that in order for someone to be able to post a block, they have to solve an answer that comes from the previous block. This is a mathematical subject that I could not explain (since i don't really understand cryptography) but let's just say that the odds of you finding it will always be smaller than the rest of the world finding the solution. For every block that could be posted, miners will get a reward of bitcoin, this is embedded in the program to give incentive to people who post transactions. And all is fine. Until we get a large number of transaction. 
So basically we have many different proposed solution for this scaling issue. But before we go there, asicboost. Basically asicboost is a tool that enables miner to solve the solution quicker (it claims 20% faster) lots of individual thinks this is unhealthy since we don't want one single company to take hold of our blockchain by being able to continually posting transactions again and again one after another. Because then they would have control on transaction fees. Allegedly some miners group use asicboost which makes the whole bitcoin community uneasy. 
One in particular is bitmain. Jihan Wu is the co-founder of bitmain. There have been arguments on which solution we should take regarding the scaling issue. Again, the decentralization of bitcoin means even choosing a solution needs the cooperation of all the nodes. Remember these are nodes run by individuals and big miners. Some miners favor solutions that would benefit them, favoring those that wouldn't render asicboost obsolete. While individuals would favor solution that decentralize control. This debate has been going on for a while, until someone propose this guerilla type solution the uasf bit 148 I don't quite understand what is inside bit 148, but it enables segwit and renders asicboost useless. So what the hell is UASF. It's user activated soft fork. What the hell is a soft fork? Remember thar block chain? A hard fork means from a particular point in that chain, there will be two group of nodes continuing the chain with a totally different format. And obviously not in sync with each other. This is the thing we are trying to avoid. Because then you would have two different bitcoin.. you will still have the same amount of bitcoin in both branch, but the dollar value will be unknown. It's such a hassle to maintain two different asset like that. A soft fork on the other hand, means that the existing chain will still accept this new type of transaction. So it's backward compatible. A more prefered solution. 
Now i sure hope someone else will explain what jihan wu did with that blog post. ELI 5 time. Imagine a digital lock. On that digital lock is written a transaction. A chain of this locks acts like a ledger because of the transactions written on it. Everyone has a copy of that digital lock chain and can create and attach the next lock to the chain. In order to do that, you must try all possible combination key for the previous lock to open it and then attach your own lock to it. You, the creator of the new lock don't have the combination of the one you just attached. In return, you get some fee. The process than repeats. Everyone will now try to break the combination of your new lock. The process takes too much time. Comes asicboost. A tool you can use to tap the locks and sort of guess the combination faster. UASF 148 proposes that we change the lock type to increase transaction speed while making asicboost obsolete."

I can recommend moving all of your coins onto a hardware wallet, I recently got a Trezor wallet but paid for expedited shipping to make sure it got to me in time. 
Imagine coinbase as a building full of safety deposit boxes each containing a users bitcoin. If you want to access your bitcoin you have to give your login info to the clerk and they go and unlock your safety deposit box for you because you are not allowed to keep the key for it. Since you don't have the key the clerk could lose your key due to incompetence or someone can trick the clerk into unlocking your box for them. Having a hardware wallet is like having your own safe to store your bitcoin in. You don't have to worry about losing your keys because someone else is not being responsible enough with them.  
I was in your position a month ago and this article was a good starting point for me to understand what is happening august 1st and how to keep my Bitcoin safe.

what is this, im always scared to click on shit because idk if its someone trying to scam me.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:59:43
I think I'll get one of those and just read the instructions. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:06:33
I tried to do this on Monday and managed to make a little money, but this is why I ordered a hardware wallet so I can put it away forget about it until after august 1st

I will never play the dip again, I bought in at 1800 and $1000 dollars profit is alot of money for me. Trying to predict where the bottom would be was even more stressful then just hodling. I would not be surprised if what they did was intentional. They have the ability to shut out 7 million bitcoin users by simply taking down the website.  Luckily in the end I came out with a little more bitcoin than I had this morning but I could have had more if Coinbase kept their shit together.

and noobs, I learned my lesson with it today though.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:36:34
sorry but is a paper wallet what it sounds like? Its just a private key on a piece of paper? I don't have a smartphone so I can't just scan QR codes. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:45:56
ahh tricksy one i see.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:07:35
Thanks for this good information. If I get a hardware wallet will any of this be an issue?
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:12:02
way to contribute nothing to the conversation and be a dumbfuck. Lots of you culty types who groan at the thought of some noob buying into bitcoin without knowing every single detail. Your probably the same type of person hyping it up luring in more noobs. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:28:42
careful, simple questions can get some of these sensitive little bitches salty. 
sorry I don't really have a good explanation for you, as you can tell im pretty salty myself.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:11:44
I have been and this was a good summary of all the things I have learned so far but don't understand them well enough to explain to others. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:41:47
not up for me, I have been screaming at my computer for 30 minutes since i got home
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:51:21
So if I go with a paper wallet temporarily, what website should I use and how do I access the bitcoin if I want to move them. Sorry but i really need someone to hold my hand with this. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:20:31
Coinbase is still having issues. I'm trying to transfer bitcoin to pay for a hardware wallet and keep getting signed out. I think im just going to give up for the day. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:33:45
Thank you for taking the time to explain the current situation. This helps to add perspective. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:09:39
im going for the nano but its going to take at least 2 months to ship.
