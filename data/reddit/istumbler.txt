- At the beginning, we will be partnering with existing payment agents. Many of our exchanges will also handle other types of remittance and many will be existing businesses (shops or deliver services).
- Best practices for meeting is a great idea, I'll make sure that's ready for our Beta, early next year.
- Our on-boarding process does some preliminary screening of potential exchangers, and we're working hard on reputation management for independent exchanger to keep them honest.
- We have to be very careful about using terms like 'escrow' and 'remittance' because they have serious regulatory implications. We're creating multi-sigunature transactions which are completed when the delivery is made, which means we never have control over the funds ourselves. Unlike a traditional escrow or remittance service, which at some point hold money in their own accounts.

That's my kind of evil.

Very carefully.
To the event that we have to collect personal information about our customers to make our service work and to comply with all applicable legal requirements, we have to have the highest security standards for that information.
One of the reasons we're not launching right away is to take the time to make sure that our system has been designed, deployed and audited to the same standards as any other system you trust your money to.
On a technical note, one of the great things about working with bitcoin is the open nature of the protocol, and the availability of testnet for easy debugging.

OK, just because there isn't a single other rational comment to hijack, here are a few perfectly valid reasons Apple may have settled on it's 'no crypto currency wallets in the app store' policy:
- user protection: if your phone can contain literally millions of dollars the user becomes a potential target for physical, network and social attacks
- money transfer is hard: legal requirements around remittance are strict and it's perfectly reasonable for Apple's lawyers to look at bitcoin and say: it's not decided yet, we don't want to be the test case
- real loss if the device is damaged: either physical or software failure could cause the loss of your private keys, and if you didn't have a backup (would you trust your wallet private keys to iCloud?) the user loses real value
Apple makes app store decisions based on what is best for the majority it's users, not developers or hackers. Most of those users don't have the technological savvy or financial means to actively participate in crypto-currencies today. If we want to change that, and I think we can and should, the crypto currency community needs to prove some things to the Apples and Governments of the world:
- that the currency is truly distributed and can survive a number of attacks and attempted manipulations
- that the community around the currency is resilient in the face of serious disruptions
- that we can cooperatively, and non-coersively self regulate and provide a better financial environment than the current institutions
- that usability and user experience of bitcoin can be brought up to Apple's standards
People buy into the Apple ecosystem partially because of this 'protective' or 'fucked' stance. They don't want random software running on their device, they want the battery to last. It's a completely different set of expectations that the build-your-own PC world.
As helpfully pointed out:

So, has anyone tried an in-app bitcoin purchase app? Just mark the price up the appropriate amount and pass it through to a web-based wallet?

That's for communications products and social interaction.

Want to build a secure protocol that nobody can hack?
"Also, pedophiles at every turn."

"We're going to have to do a background check."

Yup. Even the bobbies don't carry guns in the UK.
