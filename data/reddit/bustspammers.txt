Their email list got stolen, that's how the scammers got to the Bitstamp user base. Wrote about it here earlier:
Be careful if you're a Bitstamp user. They know you're into bitcoin and you will probably get a lot more bitcoin-related phishing and scam emails in the next couple weeks / months.

I'd like to disassociate my real identity from who runs bustspammers.com, precisely to avoid what [Miner_Willy suspected above]( *"Someone you know might know your address and might be trying to troll you."* So, yes, I created a new account to post this.

My email system is set up to retain absolutely everything. Most "normal" email hosts (Gmail, MS, Yahoo, etc.) have pretty good spam filtering. Chances are an email like this gets filtered out for you. Check your junk folder.

Wow, good to know. I guess that would explain it. Has that follow-up been publicly posted somewhere, do you have a link?
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:18:09
No it wasn't just "bitstamp". Don't wanna disclose it to maintain the ability to say "This email address has never been used or posted anywhere else."

Oh, yea, forgot about that. pay.reddit allows you to use a SSL (https:) connection across the entire site. I use a browser extension that switches this automatically and when I cut/pasted that link, it retained the pay.reddit URL.

Let's just say that while your explanations might theoretically be possible, they are much less likely to begin with.  My computer isn't compromised and even if it was, it couldn't leak those email addresses because they're not saved anywhere locally. My email server doesn't serve unencrypted connections and even if it did you wouldn't have been able to sniff out that email address over the last 10 months or so because I hadn't logged into Bitstamp or exchanged any emails with them at least that long. "Bustspammers could be the ones leaking your email" doesn't make any sense because it is my own domain.
But this is all moot because multiple other commenters here already reported receiving the same email, which rules out that it's just me, and one even confirmed that the Bitstamp email list was indeed stolen.

OK, true, for other redditors there's option 4: I could be a bad guy, making this up. Well, I for myself know that's not the case. I can't prove it to you, but that's ok, feel free to make of it whatever you want.
The address being caught in a XSS attack is highly unlikely as I haven't logged onto Bitstamp for many months and never typed this address anywhere else. Someone I know trying to troll me is also highly unlikely, since other people on here reported receiving the same email.

IP 192.241.136.248 is part of an IP pool belonging to Digital Ocean, Inc. in New York, a "hosting provider for developers".  They should have contact info of that IP's user.
Try to inquire with this guy (they may require a subpoena though):
