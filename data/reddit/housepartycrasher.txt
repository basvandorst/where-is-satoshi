It does make sense to not allow gossip and promotion of alt coins in this sub.
If you allow it, the sub would be over run with alt promotion endlessly.
Now talk about the underlying tech and technical matters I do not see getting removed and rightly so.
Honestly can you imagine the shitshow going on when 1000 alts come rushing to claim they are the next bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:38:00
Segwit made it harder on some sneaky hardware trick some miners were using or planned to us (maybe).
LN still requires 2 multisig tx on the main chain so miners don't care about that either.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:51:01
They would lose the fees in the blocks they failed to mine.
    
In the bitcoin mempool the fees would most likely never be mined at all and simply returned to the sender.
    
Lets say the math works out to a 4% gain over the course of a week. That is a really nice pile of cash, what if they found out its was 22% :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:27:37
Sadly very few realize it and it takes about 3 minutes to figure out that its completely useless as a 2nd layer for bitcoin and barely passable for litecoin 2nd layer, actually not even for litecoin.

Lost 1.4% more of the market share in a day.

When it is down to 1% of the market, will it be time to address the problems?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:33:33
So once a month the user opens and closes a channel. That is 2 actual multisig transactions on the main chain.
How many users of Bitcoin? 10 million?
    
That is 120 million total per year, leaving 40 million left for all mining and non LN transactions.
And if for some reason 20 million people want to use Bitcoin? What about only 120 million or 250 million?
    
LN will not make any difference at all when the underlying architecture can't scale. That scale has to go from a paltry 5 transactions per second now to 1000s on the main blockchain for this tech to scale and keep up with even mild adoption.
    
I was generous with the numbers, the reality is much much much worse.
    
You know enough about this tech to know this is not me making anything up.

LN would exaccerbate the underlying bottleneck.
It does not matter if LN can do a trillion transactions a second if users need to open a channel to do those trillion.
We are clogged up today with a TINY user base using bitcoin. LN solution for when we have 10x the user base from now...is what exactly.
What happens when its 100x
Imagine a massive group of stupid people, they all grunt and mumble Lightning Network when asked how bitcoin is going to be useable. That is this stupid sub.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:38:45
It can't
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:03:51
I can test the functionality of LN right now today by sending a multisig tx to the mempool.
This is the exact same thing as opening/loading a LN channel.
The results are not so hot.
    
Get back to me when a layer 2 solution solves a fundamental layer 1 bottleneck.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:49:09

@_date: 2017-12-24 07:39:03
My contention is by the time LN rolls out that the continued levels of bitcoin adoption will make it a moot point. 
    
At that point, just the basic usage of the LN channel loads and settlements will be enough to bottleneck the bitcoin chain. And this is assuming no other tx will be done on the bitcoin chain which will not be the case by a long long long shot.
   
I could go in LN channel scaling problems as well but I won't and will grant that they will be able to do a trillion tx per second with zero fees.

They choose the higher fee tx
    
The low fee tx never gets confirmed by anyone, it stays for 14 days and gets returned, they don't lose a penny but they force normal users to pay more than the artificial minimum.
    
They can even take on more risk and keep pumping the bottom, hoping real tx will pay more.

That was quite the reply, honestly thank you.
Lets say we only have 1 million bitcoin users today and you claim we can go 600x.
You are saying we can handle 600 million people per year loading and settling 1 LN channel a year? 
So Bitcoin can handle 1.2 billion transactions a year but today crumbles to a halt at 70 million a year.

You will sign up on some large hub and be able to give them cash and then you will turn that into a digital form of money that you can then have access to using a card at a retail store. When your card gets low, it won't work and you will need to send more cash to the hub to get more credits. 
Once an employer comes on board they will send your cash directly to the hub and it will be turned into digital credits that you can spend fast all over the world.
    
Wait a second....
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:31:18
Now does anyone want to bet that they will not have a single person use bitcoin to buy anything here?
Be honest.
    
LN will not change this either because the owner and customer will have to open a LN channel or happen to be part of the same LN channel to pay in bitcoin.
    
The means the owner would have to pay a bitcoin fee to open and then again to settle that channel and be paid.
Conclusion: no bitcoins will be spent here this decade unless it was an accident

I love the LN layer.
The bottleneck is the problem.
Its like plugging in a hard drive from 50 years into the future, it won't matter due to the bottlenecks between the physical drive and the data processor.
That bottleneck is the 7 transactions per second of bitcoin. The LN requires users to open and close a channel on the bitcoin chain.

Fees on actual bitcoin transaction are not and never have been percentage based. The fee is for miners to add your transaction into the block being mined.
There is tons of competition around being added so the price goes up and up.
This has very little to do with Coinbase although they could enable some tech to mitigate it a bit.

This is simple math. Are you up for answering 3 simple simple simple questions?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:55:35
I am not contending the tps on the LN itself.
My contention is with the requirement to load and settle on the main chain to even get on the channel in the first place.
    
There are a ton of questionable attributes with the hubs and scaling but I am conceding all of that because it does not matter.
    
What matters is the inability to actually load and settle. You cared enough to watch but you did not listen well nor notice how she breezed right by the most crucial aspect of the technology.

We agree. So we don't have to look into that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:44:21
You can set the fees to nearly nothing or as high as you want.
The transaction pool is an open market based economy. It used to be free but it began to be abused and the code was changed to require a fee.
Most people think it is a line, first come first serve. It is more like a show that happens every 10 minutes and will only let in 3500 people, the miners run that show and they try to pick the 3500 people that pay the most to see the next show. You can even go directly to a large pool of miners and pay them extra to get in the next show that they put on.
Amazing world!

I have it on good authority that the plural of bitcoin is bitcoins but the s is silent.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:37:19
All of that is predicated on either a very few select companies essentially becoming BitcoinPaypal and ignores the LN lack of ability to scale to 1000s of users per channel let alone them millions per channel.
I work around would be a company keeping a database themselves and updating each users entry.
If that is the case just create Bitcoin Bank and tie your Visa into it and TRUST Bitcoin Bank to have all the bitcoin they say they do and the money as well.

I 100% agree.
I also think everyone should know why and how it happens.
5 transactions per second is cool when 1 million people own it and they only use it 2 times a week.
Guess what happens when 25 million people own it.

You are right, those centralized hubs taking in the money will be trustworthy and never mess around with your money. You won't have to provide your left nut to prove your identity to be a part of the hub, the hub would never release all your private information to the government. A hub will be your friend.

I could but I am too lazy. I would have to go on youtube and dig around searching for a wallet that allowed my to import a private key, find out how to export my current private key, then import that into the new wallet then broadcast a new valid  transaction with a much higher satoshi per byte than my original, all while the clock is ticking. I would fail.

He was amazed when someone was gpu hashing at a decent rate and could not believe the hash rate. I agree he was caught off guard and did not realize the extent to which the mining would become centralized into a few massive pools and even the small edge granted by being geographically closer to other miners.
The end result will be 90% of the miners in a pool all within 50 miles of each other max.

No 10 minutes is the average time it takes to do the math work to find a right answer.
You could end up taking 2 minutes or 18 minutes but on average over 2 weeks its close to 1 block per 10 minutes. If it is higher or lower then the math problem adjusts itself to help keep the average at 10 minutes.
3500 is roughly the number of transactions can fit in a block, segwit makes the data size of a transaction 30% smaller so if everyone uses it then we could fit in 4500ish but it is harder on some mining equipment so they don't like it too much (it also lowers fees so there is that too).

We began to see a glimpse of the future when it neared 20k
    
Poor people can't even buy into the future due to the high fees. Those fees will continue to rise.
Imagine a day when instead of saying you should not buy in with less than $100 it is you should not buy in with less than $20,000.
    
We lock out 5 billion people for the tech, those that got here first are rich for life, those born now are going to have a problem with that.

@_date: 2017-12-25 04:50:50
I am not young but here goes.
The block is 1 MB in size and the math allows for an average of 1 block of transactions to be added to the chain of blocks every 10 minutes.
   
Right now segwit is barely adopted at 15% but lets assume magic happens and we move to 100% adoption.
    
The blocks stay the same size a 1mb but now we can fit roughly 3x the number of transactions inside the block.
    
Currently we do 5 transactions per second or 3000 per block but if magic happens and segwit is fully adopted we could do 9000 heck lets say 10000 per block.
    
At this point with the magic in place we go from 145 million to roughly 500 million max transactions per year on the main chain.
    
LN requires the use to do 2 transactions on the main chain to complete a use cycle of the tech. These are multisig tx which take 1.3 times the space so 2.6 total.
    
LN claimed people would maybe keep a channel open for 1 month at a time with hubs staying open for much longer.
     
So a normal bitcoin user using LN would make 12 * 2.6 tx per year on the main chain. 31.2 we will call it 30. 
    
Now the miners need to use the main chain and other will use it to store and keep control of the coins to and those will take part of the 500 million max tx per year. Lets be generous and say only 100 million non LN based tx will happen at the very max no matter how many people use bitcoin (again being awesomely fair and underestimating).
    
So we are down to 400 million, divide that by 30 uses per user and you have a max of 13.3 million possible users of bitcoin.
    
We have that now, what if we go to 130 million users? Now you can open open and settle 1 channel per year (good luck there).
    
In reality at 30 million users it grinds to a halt. At 20 million users its a shit show.

Small loss to learn a very important lesson.
Before a move ask yourself how things works, how would I use it, move it, sell it? What are the fees and times involved? How can I verify what I know or think I know? Is this too complicated for me, if so how are normal people going to figure it out, what will they do when faced with these problems.
The more you know.

They know they mine a relatively fixed rate of blocks and use that rate to determine the profitability of gaming the mempool. 2-3 large mining pools doing this would reap massive rewards.

You have your rule, my rule is if you are too lazy to figure out the max txs per year on the main blockchain then you do not deserve to be educated.
You can win but the only way you win is to put in some effort and not rely on others to do the work for you.
Or you can lose and stay uneducated.

The chain size grows faster and faster and it was designed to grow slowly. That slow speed is a design feature for security. It lowers the chance of malleability to near 0.

Quickly run into over use of a main chain to record every single use of the coins. This balloons the size of the blocks which leads to centralization and oddly enough it forces miners to be geographically closer to each other to shave latency out of the equation.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:59:46
I did not run the math so don't quote me.
Imagine a company mining for a profit (like all of them are doing). Someone or most likely themselves, realizes this and at the next meeting:
    
"Ni Hao!"
    
"Hey what if just maybe what if we sent in 25,000 min fee tx into the mempool  and convinced 2 other large pools to do the same? What might happen on say a busy busy day to the average fee?"
    
"How much would this test cost?"
    
"$7500 but it might net $32000 extra a week"
    
"Fuck it lets give it a try"
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:58:32
It does not.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:20:22
Was at 15300 now down to 14200
He asked if it was the right time to buy, I said not that minute because I had the charts up in front of me and sell walls were pushing the price lower.
Overall the down trend continues this week. If we see 12000 again, expect 10000 and 8000 comes into play.
