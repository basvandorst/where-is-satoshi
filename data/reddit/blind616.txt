To be fair, people usually buy when they get some sort of bonus. That's why it raises during christmas and summer (christmas bonus + vacation bonus).

Why are you suddenly attacking me

On this account, sure =)

600 x 14 months. Always use annual salary please.
Of course, you won't be able to live in the bigger cities with that wage, where a 2-bedroom goes for 900~1100€.
Significantly cheaper than the US, but the salaries are also significantly lower.

I know, I'm european as well, but that's a problem because people from my country keep:
- comparing their monthly x14 to other countries' x12
- getting 'tricked' by employees that promise them a certain monthly wage, but many times the two extra months being lower than the rest. (this is an issue because the salary seems bigger on paper, but there could be better offers that offer a lower monthly salary.. makes sense? My wording seems confusing)

If Bitcoin goes up 10x it doesn't matter if you have 1 bitcoin or 0.0001 Bitcoin. The money you put will be 10x higher. I too wanted up have at least one Bitcoin, but that seems to be impossible now.

Never heard that one. You could have told me that before I had my crisis like the other guy is having now :D

And you're right. That's what the s stands for. The back-backslash represents the protection /s

If he doesn't know how to write Federal Reserve Notes he should have called them Dollars, like he himself suggested in the post. It was a snarky joke.

Ops, that's not a backslash. Fixed the original message.

If everyone believes it's ***the*** bottom, then it is. Simple.

He should have called them dollars.

Honestly, with an hypothetical situation like that it's quite normal that  people wouldn't want them in Dollars. Dollars devalorize over time, all the other options valorize. Bitcoin wouldn't be the safest bet, but that's also why so many would want them in gold.

I had never heard of those. Isn't that just for Caesar's Cipher?
I meant something like this:
Suppose your private key (key1) is: **6BF2254CC6E8AD348CE6EFF635E39**
Generate a random key (key2): **7F222DF11EC55F72F9D86726E8D8F**
XOR them both (key3):
Give key2 and key3 to spouse and lawyer. key1 is only known to yourself and to whoever holds both key2 and key3. If you die, Lawyer gives their key to spouse, spouse can now know key1.
Edit: Formatting.

I did a project on my Crypto class on that exact subject :) It's pretty good for these situations.

If people want it to be more secure, use a one-time pad scheme instead of splitting the key into half. Give one key to the lawyer and the other to the wife so that only when both keys are XOR'd together they'd form the real key. 
That way neither key **alone** would reveal anything about the real private key.
