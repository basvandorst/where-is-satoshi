I really appreciate the comment!  I'll try that and let you know how it goes.  I guess I need to buy a USB to SATA adapter.  So you're saying remove the HDD then use the USB to SATA adapter thing?  I'm confused about this part I guess as I've never really taken out the HDD before.  
Also I don't even remember what the .txt file was called or anything.  However, I'm 95% sure it was a .txt file with the private keys inside.
After I run the scan will I easily be able to just look at .txt files to make it easier and waste less time?

ugh I can't find it and don't really know where to look.  The thing is that I reformatted my HDD several times so there's multiple windows.old folders and what not.  Some have no data in them though so does that mean they're gone forever?  For instance one folder windows.old.001 has no data in it.  It was deleted around the time I was using the bitcoins(2014).  
I looked through my gmail account and it says I initially bought the bitcoins in 2013 and so I'm worried it's gone forever as there's no windows.old*** dated in 2013.
I wanna do mass recovery with the ! Lost &amp; Found ! thing in the directory but I'd have to buy the program, and I'm not sure if it would even be there.  
What should I do in your opinion?

Thanks, I'll check that out.

I'm on a full ride scholarship, so no loans.  But yeah I'm not dumb enough to invest everything into something as volatile as bitcoin.  Yeah they're probably gone but some other redditors are saying it's possible to retrieve them, so I'm gonna at least try.

My hopes aren't up but I'm definitely gonna try it!

I am using the same HDD as back then.  What do you mean by undelete programs?  Just google that and see what comes up?  This was several years ago or so so I'm not getting my hopes up..  Definitely worth trying though as I had what's worth like $15,000 right now.  I hate myself lol.

Makes sense.

Ran that program and got 24 search results.  From the look of it though 95% of those are google searches done recently.  What if I ran a search of my blockchain.info username?  Would that turn up some stuff you think?

Thank you, I'll try this as soon as I have some free time.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:34:22
God speed my friend, let me know if you figure it out.  I can't really do this right now as I'm working on school stuff but I will when I have some free time.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:27:26
I'm definitely gonna look into it, that's like $15,000 worth of bitcoins I had!
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:27:58
Yeah, my hopes aren't up.  But it's worth trying I'd say.
