You both can cancel other wise you both lose your deposits if you let the time run out.
If you both come to an agreement to cancel, then you get your deposits back. Which is why both parties should deposit the same. If the client is not happy with the work, and the other side will not cancel, then you will both lose your deposit. So, not only will the person you are hiring for the job lose the time towards the project, he would also lose his deposit himself.
As for the 2nd point, not at this time but it is a great suggestion. I will forward it.

Oh wow, I don't know where to get started with this technology. I have been testing this product with David the creator for the past 2 weeks. I can not contain my excitement. It adds a lot more than appearances. 
I will also note that the full release will include Bitcoin with Blackcoin as we are firm believers in no alternate currency will be the first. Bitcoin will be the first in everything as it is the flagship of all digital currencies.
So, this technology literally takes the 2 dimensions of digital currencies and adds a 3rd dimension. It opens up many doors. It contains multisig contracts, joint accounts, an automated escrow service, transfer of funds, auto staking even in cold storage through it's node service, smart contracts, even a decentralised exchange when Night Trader is released.
What does this mean?
Literally, your wallet is secure  which is a big important factor to us. With 2 factor authentication wallets, it gives you two keys for your wallet. Ideally, you want to put 1 key on a USB and the other on your laptop. If someone gets access to your 1 key, the wallet is accessible without the other key. It is the same thing as having 2 keys for a nuclear bomb. You can't detonate without the other key. 
With the 2fa, there is also an option to cancel one of the keys to create a joint account with your loved one or your business partner. Also, with multi sig accounts you can not send funds with out the approval of the other people involved.
Now here comes the fun part. The Smart Contract system is just incredible. Essentially, it uses encrypted e-mails to talk with other clients to send messages on the progression of contracts. It is a bit hard to explain and one of those more "See it to believe it" type of ordeals. I'll try my best and I promise to make a video explaining it.
Let's say I want to buy a Bitcoin or a Blackcoin. I want to buy just 1. I have a few options... To trust someone else that I don't know, or trust someone else that I do know. Now, I have many friends however, not all my friends trade Bitcoin so usually the case is to trade with someone you don't know usually through an exchange or on Local Bitcoins. Any of those 2 parties can scam me and leave me without my money. For example, on Local Bitcoins I could send money via Western Union and may never see that Bitcoin ever arrive to me. With an exchange, Mt. Gox. Enough said.
How does BlackHalo / BitHalo fix this problem?
What the contract system does is fixes this 'trust problem' between myself, and a complete stranger. Let's say I agree to trade over Western Union (which is handy for me because I moved to Cambodia) and I initiate a trade with someone. We both setup a contract between ourselves and discuss the price right in the client. We then set an amount to deposit or, risk as incentive. Since I am buying 1 BTC or however many Blackcoin, let's say we both agree to deposit the same amount. I am buying 1 BTC, and I deposit 1 BTC and he deposits 2 BTC. What this does is protect both of us.
Now, the deposits and the amount he is sending gets moved into 'escrow' away from both parties hands. I sent the money equal to 1 BTC through Western Union, he receives it, now the client gives him 3 choices. He can either Confirm that he received the payment, trash the contract, or Cancel the contract. 
Let's say he an honest man and confirms that he recieved the payment. The funds get released automatically out of escrow, I get my 1 BTC plus my deposit, and he gets his 2 BTC deposit back. 
Let's say there was a mistake of I changed my mind. I can click the "Cancel" button. Now, both parties both have to click the Cancel button in the client for this to work. The 1 BTC goes back to the seller plus his 2 BTC deposit, and I get my 1 BTC deposit back.
Let's say he tries to scam me, so he trashes the client OR the timer runs out (yes you can set an agree time limit), the funds in escrow move to a wallet where no one can touch them ever again. He loses 2 BTC, I lose 1 BTC. Therefore, he loses money even with receiving funds from myself.
Everything is automated. Anyone can be trusted with this system.
That is just 1 example of how I can use it in my life. You can use it for anything though. Selling products, doing a graphic design job for someone then being paid when the contract is finished, having a bet with your friend over a game... There is a world of possibilities.
Also, it does also have as a side-product of the contract system, full anon capabilities as you don't need to know the other person's BC or BTC address to finish the contracts.
What I am saying is, even with the added security, you can trust someone with out worrying about an exchange running away with all your coins like Mt Gox and CryptoRush.
That is just the start of it. It is still in beta, it is ugly but all the key features are there. There is also Night Trader coming out that will essentially replicate exactly what we see in a market exchange with BlackHalo / BitHalo.

Read my lengthly responce on this post. You'll understand how =).

Well, if Bitcoin was to have fast transactions it would require a hard fork correct? We all know how many problems that can cause. So, this doesn't actually answer my questions.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:05:44
Bitcoin will be with the release.
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:26:18
David's project has been in the works for 6 months originally for Bitcoin. The full release will contain both Bitcoin and Blackcoin. It isn't in connection with OpenBazaar. As far as I know they got the idea from BlackHalo.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:01:25
Just bringing valid concerns.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:35:14
If you want me to walk you through it join us on IRC  or

That is classified however, I will happily walk you through it if you have the time.
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:46:32
Probably the most innovative exchange to date in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:18:37
Not designed to pump at all. We never have designed news to 'pump'. We are a large community that actually wants to further Digital currencies for adoption. This application will actually solve all concerns over in China.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:07:20
It is going unnoticed and I will be making a video on how to use it. I have been testing it for the last 2 weeks personally with David, the creator. He has been working hard on it for the past 6 months and it will change how we deal with digital currencies and it does affect Bitcoin since it will be released for Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2014-08-29 03:57:50
I live in Cambodia, moved from Canada... Love it here. It isn't as bad as many people imagine. We have debit cards and credit cards here and trust me, they do not understand the concept of magic internet money. Also the fact that only the rich would be able to use it won't make it successful. 
If people are expecting an entire country where less than 50% of the people have electricity to start using digital currencies over night, they are surely mistakened.
The only people who will get into it are expats like myself. We have meetings every month for digital currencies in Cambodia and not 1 local has ever showed up.

IT will be coming out for BTC as well.

I posted a lengthly response explaining exactly what it is and how to use it in this thread.

Nothing wrong with providing options.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:09:01
We are just providing a safer option =).
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:08:28
yea that will be coming with Night Trader.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:09:53
For your first critique, Night Trader which will be released in the near future which will do just as you stated. It will do the same thing as an actual exchange.
Also, again yea you have a valid point there but you can always trade with a high rated trader on Local Bitcoin or elsewhere.
The escrow agent is nobody. The coins go to a holding wallet and then released automatically based on the conditions. All the clients communicate with each other and all the information regarding everything is stored in Blackcoin's blockchain itself.
@_date: 2014-08-29 06:03:43
Ah got it.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:49:08
Do you want me to walk you through it and prove it works right in front of you =)?
Download the client and I will send you some BC so I can explain it step by step.

Hence why we have been massively against it even though we received a -fair- amount of flak from community members.
It will affect all of digital currency credibility in a negative way.

The problem with decentralising trading exchanges is the fact that you are now dealing with the blockchain limitations. The fact that we are still relying on 3rd parties, is because again, you are dealing with the Blockchain's limitations which are too slow for majority of people.
Ex: Takes 1 hour 40 minutes ish to begin trading. First, you need to take your Bitcoin, and split it into 'change'. That way, you can sell smaller quantities (if you are doing Bitcoin -&gt; altcoin). For fiat, you would need to do double deposit escrow, then pay the bank transfer fees, PayPal fees, or whatever. Again, a longer process.
My opinion, will be to wait until a proper decentralised exchange comes out and use NuBit's as your USD. That way you can avoid those fees going in, and coming out in a decentralised system. Trading will be on a whole new level of slow though.
