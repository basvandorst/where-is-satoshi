Sure it probably increases the chance that you will lose some money, but if I had store 42 BTC in one or more exchanges for some weird reason. It would be getting split across four or more exchanges to minimize the risk of the whole 42 disappearing at once.

Most other apps (in the stick) work with bitcoin (chrome app), Ethereum has a separate chrome app.  Neo has the Neon desktop app.

I went the other way and have a table of unused address that were generated with vanity gen with a 1.
Each time the site needs a new address it pulls it from that table and sets a flag saying its used.
This way I can generate both keys on my desktop computer and only move the public keys to the server.
The problem with this is keeping the table full of unused addresses, every now and then it runs out.

They are a webserver that has the linux bitcoin daemon running [bitcoind]
( but even more then that because bitcoin uses the flat file database and thats too slow for web interface access (So they usually run a mysql database). 
Even if it was fast theres no bitcoind call that will give a balance for an address not in the "local wallet". The transactions are synced from the daemon database files and RPC interface calls to the daemon. 
Other bitcoin blockchain sites:

yes that's what that post says - my understanding is:
To pull this off and scam any exchange:
you need to know how to make transactions probably through code or using some tool to make it slightly easier
* you put your bitcoins inside exchange
* withdraw bitcoins
* inspect transaction
* quickly make transaction similar but slightly different
* hope your custom one goes through - you now have your bitcoins
* if not your normal one goes through - you now have your bitcoins
* if the custom transaction makes it
* ask exchange to refund - point at original transaction failure
* then you have twice as many bitcoins and the exchange is out of pocket

Hey, sure the question was more around the fact that CoinJar moved from CBA (business accounts and personal were closed on them with no reason or warning) and asked to leave NAB as well then they moved to ubank (kinda NAB) now their bpay. So the question is if they can't accept deposit of AUD through the bank system, how can you? Also how can you be sure this will not happen to your bank accounts?

basically take the amount we want to send  say 6000 btc    
random between 6000 X 0.4 and 6000 X 0.6
random between 2400 3600
send transaction for 3561.234321 whatever the random gods decide
money we didn't send goes to change address so we don't have to worry... now we have a rough max %40/%60 split

the problem with storing fiat under the mattresses is not the storage method its the redundancy
the bitcoins actually live in the p2p ledger on everyone's computer that runs the full client
the keys are what people are printing out here and storing - so you can make duplicates of the keys (with out duplicating the value) store at two or more secure locations
you can backup bitcoins, backing up cash is fraud

you are placing a **very very very risky bet** that it will come good and you will be able to get that BTC out of gox at a later stage.
its possible because bitcoinbuilder has its own internal order books for who has what real and gox btc

I don't give out trading/gambling advice
I almost brought a gox BTC when they were .7 (about a week or so ago)
I sold 11 bitcoins for around $30 USD each (was a while ago though)

I have a vote page on my site 
I use vanitygen to make a lot of address and store only the public key in the unused key database on the webserver.
Once its been assigned to the coin, I have a cron task that checks the 20 oldest (last checked timestamp) with one API call to blockr.io every 30 seconds to see if any money has been sent in and to update the votes.
I guess you could do something similar.
1. generate keys (run vanitygen with 1 to text file)
2. store only public key in "unused keys table"
3. person places order
4. gets allocated key from unused table
5. task calls each allocated public address to Blockr.io api (or any other bitcoin explorer api) to see if funds are there 
6. if funds are there mark payment complete.
later some sort of automatic bitcoin sweeping bot from your private keys would probably be required however don't do this on your webserver.
**This way you just need to keep your unused public keys topped up and if your webserver is compromised there is no funds on there.**

Around when I posted this I looked again and was not willing to give bitcoin builder my documents to get verified... 
Aparently with them finding 200,000 BTC it means theres a **very very slim** chance people may evetualy get back %26 of what they had so ya perhaps some people will come out on top...

The main thing I love about it it the fact that I can buy something from the US and not have to stuff around with currency conversions - Just see the price pay - bam easy.
Also having donation links on my website  and coinbase checkout integrated in to the graphs makes it ridiculously easy for someone to pay me even if there from the other side of the world. 
It is really world-wide programmable cash. I would also like to be able to use it at my local coffee shop but I haven't asked them yet.

I think wallets are more nuanced then this, web wallets has a picture of a phone near it? This means that all phone wallets are web wallets? mycelium lets you keep your own keys and is much different then the circle or coinbase apps.

fyi thats not how it works, more money will not make the transaction more expensive.
more inputs = larger transaction size (in bytes) = more fees

If you have ever used eBay or something similar to sell a popular item, let's say a used iphone 5 what gives the iphone 5 it's price? If we pretend there is no quality difference between iphones, the going price will settle somewhere between what people are willing to sell for and what people are willing to pay.

one involves getting more bitcoin mining power then the whole network
my opinion is it cant be done, (to much electricity required to run it in one or even 20 locations, getting/making the hardware etc.)
the other involves a few guys with guns to turn up at each of the "trusted partners" places
this can be done.
@_date: 2015-04-16 14:38:14
no stellar relies on trust, bitcoin is trustless
You have to trust the gateway to honor your deposits and withdrawals of credit it has issued.

50 GH/s is like 15 **cents** USD per day at today's difficultly and the difficultly keeps going up (a lot) because every day more hashing power seems to be brought online.
Even if you are buying the mining power in USD you would just be better to buy bitcoin and hold it if you want to speculate on the price instead of mine it.
A lot of people suspect that there is no actual hardware and the cloud mining places are just ponzi scams.
Source: I use to mine in my house, you can no longer do this (and expect a return) you need a dam datacenter and a few mill USD to get setup (oh and dirt cheap power)

hmm possibly though the code i had took a snapshot of the UTXO and then stopped once it was at the most recent block.
You would be better off parsing the blockchain for UTXO and storing it in a database then listing to the bitcoin network for new blocks and adding them to the database all the time.

I agree its a terrible idea, you are basically creating your own financial accounting software that is holding other peoples funds.

I have have learned a lot from setting up two different mining pools (NOMP and MPOS ) , a block explorer and a tipbot -  I have also developed  my self.


Im a fan of ruby on rails - however my pool is now node.js and my block explorer and tipbot are python


yes - though who or what is making the decisions as to funds being released would be interesting...


cloudfare or other ddos protection would be required - strong server passwords that change often  - don't code the logon system your self (in rails use something like the [devise gem]( - and of course firewall and log files of everything - also I might be biased but for the love of god don't deploy to a windows server!!
Edit: Before you ask the other sites I didn't link are for a altcoin and that's why I didn't and wont link them.

They setup [big fake walls]( a little back from the actual trading. This scares away traders that may go long, usually they are running a bot to automatically buy coins slowly while the wall is up.
at some stage once they have enough they crank the buy bot and pull the wall, this causes a pump.

Gox is inflated at the moment because US and Australian (perhaps others?) Gox customers are having a hard time getting their money out, knowing this they have to use the AUD or USD in there Gox account to buy bitcoin at an inflated price to move else where to sell at a lower price. Also because of this there is more upwards force on Gox then other places because not everyone is willing to sell bitcoin for funny Gox money that you cant cash out easily (may take a month or more).
For every seller there is a buyer so don't be confused in to saying that there is more people buying then selling **this is false**. (Unless there's a [market maker]( in the middle, Gox is not a market maker)
Have a look at  at the moment the USD on there is only $0.7952 away when compared to the fair rate.

Its a hosted wallet service just like ~~blockchain.info and~~  coinbase.com however its based in australia.

I started with a spread sheet a while ago and got sick of updating the exchange rates all the time, hence the site. There is a new version out ~~soon~~ in about a month (sneak peek:
I am thinking of allowing you to download a CSV file as a backup. Though it would be a static snapshot at that point in time.
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:01:44
yes, actually they put all the customer funds in to one or a handful of address. Then they use their own database to track who owns what. If that database and its backups become corrupt its impossible to sort out.
This is why you don't pay a miner fee to send from circle account to circle account because no bitcoin actually moves anywhere. You also wont find a TXID (transaction ID) and be able to find the transaction on the blockchain.

I am mining to hold at the moment, so not to interested in short term gains. There is always altcoins like LTC.
Usually when the difficulty goes up the price follows somewhat. 
Edit: And I am not just holding BTC, worse case its not profitable and it all just seems to be going no where so I sell the graphics cards a bit under what I payed and cash out all my coins.
All I know is that when I started 7 months ago everyone was having a cry on the forums saying that your too late you cant make any money now block reward halving, oh woe is me..... I hope to look back at this post in 7 months and smile at how right I was...
Also have 2 BFL 4.5gh/s miners on order from September, already cashed out (when BTC was $138 on its way up to ~$260) to pay for these (from my single HD 5850 mining BTC that I sold off the other week). 
I also brought the humble bundle for $70 (worth of BTC) and got a present for my dad from cufflinked.com.au with BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:08:40
I was lucky September last year I used my second mined BTC to buy 350 LTC at 0.003 and 0.002, didn't do as well as some of the people who buy coins but it was quite a low risk investment.
I now have a mining rig with 3 7950s a website  and more then 400 LTC. I have never brought coins, unless its with money that I cashed out of coins. Only hardware/power.

1.    Start up bitcoin-qt
2.    Open the debug window console (under help)
3.    Enter walletpassphrase &lt;my passphrase&gt; 60 (if you have one)
4.    Enter dumpprivkey &lt;address with all the bitcoins&gt;
5.    Copy the private key that is displayed  (print out as a backup just in case - this is the ability to spend coins)
6.    Figure out how to import in to new lite client  - [Perhaps this](

I agree, I only mentioned the other "hosted wallets" as examples.
I believe security was the issue at the heart of the OP's question, all three services can run away/shut down and take your coins. Therefor it matters not if they are different in some other way.
Put another way: All three services have you private key and thus the ability to spend/move your coins, whether or not you can get or have a copy of they key is irrelevant in a security context.
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:42:35
don't think so, the function for address generation is more complicated then just

hidden partition = plausible deniability
normal wallet.dat encryption no plausible deniability, not to mention there's no way of removing the password if required later, short of making a new wallet.dat and transferring all the coins.
when 25 BTC is worth $25000 or more in the future, the hidden partition may just save me
yes **i was silly** i should have had more then the two copies seeings as one ended up being corrupted, and the other on a harddrive that ended up playing up (this is the one i managed to recover).

 -  you can kinda make an account, the reason I went with a passprhase is I didn't want people giving me forum/reddit account names,or email address and reusing passwords.
The new site will always store the info in the database on the server so it will be more simple.
The ability to have the same coin listed in your folio n number of times and how much easier it will be for me to keep the site up to date with the new coins, are the main things im looking forwards to.
The new version is the only time I have ever tried to make anything using RoR so the learning curve was a bit steep. Think I just need a few more weekends on it to get all the features from the old asp.net(C site across and get all the bugs out.

Not very secure if I have other copy's of the wallet.dat lying around.

guys im not here to argue, I was here to share my experiences to perhaps save someone from the same troubles I had.
Though it would be trivial to code a bot that looked at every file on a PC under 1mb that had "[NUL][SOH][EOT]pool" inside multiple times. A more sophisticated method would use [**this**]( or even try to pull out the public address of each file and check against blockchain.info, if coins inside upload nakedphotos.jpg.
Renaming your wallet.dat is not going to stop you coins getting stolen, even using 7zip with a password would be better then that.

Today Tonight is a horrible TV show, they know very little about what they report, all hype and no content. Whats more its usually factually incorrect as you have pointed out above.

I ordered one then another so when I combined them they first got pushed back a month :(
Hence a 4500 order number in amongst 7500s

I changed everything to unique randomly generated passwords and I now use a password manager
email is the most important because if they get in there they can reset your passwords to other things, if they get in to ebay like sites they can leverage your feedback and long standing account to scam people out of money

thanks, would definitely go to a Brisbane meetup :D

the problem is that no one knew back then that BTC would rise like it did.. or everyone including me would have brought/held BTC...
@_date: 2013-06-22 11:59:31
So if I buy a miner today and its worth say 2 BTC ($240)  and I get it in 5 months time, I mine with it for one year and make 5 BTC then I decided to sell it all... say market rates are bad and I only get $140 for my 5 BTC and I sell my miner for $40... looking at BTC I made a profit, looking at Fiat I made a loss...

assuming windows:
to open the standard client on the testnet copy/make a shortcut to the normal btc client and add -testnet=1 to the shortcut (end of file path), should load with a green splash page and icon.

if they are so trigger happy to delist things, why are they considering it

Perhaps I misunderstood how blockchain.info works seems they have a encrypted version of your private keys, that only your password with them can decrypt. Well thats what they say here 
But its a closed source system as far as I know, so how do you really know?
