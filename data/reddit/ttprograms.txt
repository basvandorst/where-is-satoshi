That's only the case if they have access to majority mining power, which will likely not be the case in the future (and is not even the case now without significant coordination). The same hardfork could be done on Bitcoin, it's just had 8 years of growth to make it harder to amass the mining power.

Why would a hard fork matter? A hard fork on the Bitcoin blockchain in 2009 wouldn't have had a significant effect, and it's equally possible.

Precedent is irrelevant - the votes of the network miners are their own. The only thing that matters is functionality. This could also be done on bitcoin if someone decided to release a client that could ignore certain addresses.
This issues being raised here are fundamental to the concept of a blockchain, not Ethereum.

It ends when the network is large enough to make it fiscally unviable to hard fork. The capabilities are fundamentally not different from Bitcoin in this regard. What the community chooses to do this early on is pretty much irrelevant, IMO.

That explains why expecting a hardfork is different, but it doesn't explain why the hardfork would make the network "dead". A hardfork displays a vulnerability in the premise of the blockchain, but that same vulnerability exists in theory in all tech based on a blockchain, including Bitcoin.

Ah, good point - misread ethstats.net

216000 Eth is generated per day. Currently ~15% of ETH is held by devs - in a year it will be roughly half that. I don't see this as a major cause for concern.
Primalbase tokens, like most ICOs, do not pass the howey test - they represent presale of a commodity. This is well established and explained by experts familiar with ICOs. There's no reason to think that's illegal. The worst you can say about it is that it's ill-advised, but that's true of tons of startups and hardly a cause for concern. "Worthless" and "guaranteed to fail" are obviously subjective statements without anything to back them up.

Any source on the premine? It looks like 60M ETH were mined and then presold. It's not like Vitalik is sitting on 60M ETH...
Also I think most people could care less that Vitalik sits on some advisory board for a startup unless their killing babies and puppies.
