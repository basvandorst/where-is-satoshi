Two separate BTC withdrawals confirmed on Oct 28. Took less than two hours.

For how long has this been an issue?

This is a pretty low-effort article..  
* Bitcoin does not use 1% of global power. It uses \~0.2% of electricity consumption and 0.025% of global energy.
* Electricity is \~50% of mining cost, not 90%. The remaining 50% is mostly capital depreciation plus some limited overhead.
* Bitcoin is overwhelmingly powered by renewables (&gt;75%), so its carbon footprint is already much lower than other high-energy industries.
Recouping heat for your hot water sounds smart (and would be cool if you're mining as a hobby or whatnot), except that most mining is done on industrial scales and making use of this heat would require district-heating levels of capital investment in piping and town/city/farmland distribution. Investments like those require multi-decade usage to recap costs. Not saying it's silly, just unrealistic until the industry is more mature.

If you really feel like trying, go ahead, but I've tried to reason with her through FT comment fields for *years* already and you might as well try shouting at her from your window in Swahili.
Not only does she not understand the protocol *at all*, but she has no real understanding of economics, cryptography or currency, much less the combination thereof. Mind you though, this will not stop her from immediately hitting the trenches, spew out (what she believes is) fancy, but misconstrued terminology and call you an idiot (Dunning-Krueger effect, anyone?).
No idea how she became the de facto "expert" on cryptocurrency at FT (which substantially dents their credibility as an intelligent source), but at this point I'm just enjoying watching her dig her career deeper and deeper into a hole where she can sit in the dark and think long and hard about her own limitations.

This is interesting, do you have any links to info regarding these services?
