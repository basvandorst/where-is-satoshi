Well, this is a concept for now. Got some people working on it with me. If you wanted to sign transactions you'd have to transfer it to an actual wallet, or send bitcoin directly from Record 0's current address.

You know what, I'm gonna post this comment itself :D

I would love that, if you're offering.

It is a true paper wallet. The private and public keys are stored on a nfc chip in a pvc plastic card, which has no connection the the internet. The app is generic and the base can therefore be redistributed, so more than one wallet can have the same ePaper support. Heck, there wouldn't be any servers to store it on! Any app that supports is just a client that rewrites code on a chip. No storage, no bitconnect

I am looking for a business partnership though, so yeah

Paper wallets are 100% hackproof, where hardware wallets could lead to a hacker stealing your coins. With paper wallets, the only way to get the coins on them is to steal a wallet. By using the above suggested app, you are exponentially increasing the security and viability of paper wallets.

Most NFC Cards with enough memory offer an encryption option. I recommend [this]( if you're looking into it. It has a 48 bit encryption key option, and supports all of this. Also, you could encrypt the specific keys you want to protect using BIP38.

Thanks, I thought of doing this, but using an identifier different than a space. Also, lets incorporate my __**secret**__ idea I kept hidden until now (and is now patent pending :P ) NFC Cards! 
QR Codes are a 90's thing, deprecated beyond belief, and are already being outdone by 1000x by Smart Posters, which use NFC technology. Now let's apply that to bitcoin. Sure, there are credit cards out there that link to a coinbase account, etc etc. But those are stored on your hard drive, and are therefore not mobile, and can be hacked by people hacking directly into your computer, and same with phones. By using an ePaper wallet app (that's what I'm calling it), it allows you to store all of your bitcoin and [peni]( umm... ethereum... in a smarter paper wallet.
Here's how the tech works. In NFC, there can be multiple "records", which are different partitions of data. They can store text, a www link, etc.
Records on the Card:
"Public": Public Key on the Front of the Card, not Technically in the Records on the Chip
"PVT": The Private Key for "Public", encrypted in BIP38. Where money is transferred, but should NOT be used to store coins or used in transactions. Don't even give this to wallets.
"0": The Main Private Wallet, used for transactions. Usually Nothing in it, and is in Read/Write mode in case of security breaches. If you wanna use this to transfer money from an ePaper wallet to another wallet, this is the key you would enter. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one.
"DEEP1": Private "Deep Storage" Wallet  using whatever crypto you want. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one.
"DEEP2": Private "Deep Storage" Wallet  using whatever crypto you want. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one. 
"DEEP3": Private "Deep Storage" Wallet  using whatever crypto you want. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one.
"DEEP4": Private "Deep Storage" Wallet  using whatever crypto you want. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one.
"DEEP5": Private "Deep Storage" Wallet  using whatever crypto you want. The Public Key doesn't matter for this one.
ETC, ETC, as many Private Storage Wallets as Your NFC Card Can Hold.
Whenever an incoming payment happens, it goes from the public address to the "pvt" key. From there, you can use the app to take the money in your "pvt" wallet and transfer it evenly across the 5+ "Deep Storage Wallets", so all of your money isn't in the same place. If you wanna take money out and spend it, click a button and specify the amount you need, then it'll be evenly split from throughout your wallet and into Wallet "0", which you can spend. The entire wallet takes place on your NFC Plastic "ePaper Wallet" card, with help from the app.
TL;DR - Awesomeness
EDIT: Thinking about when I get the mobile app up and running, I could implement Android Pay and Apple Pay!! :P

I mean, I'd like some credit (maybe capital...?) but that's the gist.
