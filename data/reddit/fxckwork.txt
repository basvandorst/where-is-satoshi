Vending machines would love Bitcoin adoption actually.
No more money sitting in the machine, instead it's delivered straight to your wallet.

A quick estimation, with numbers from Coinmarketcap.com and assuming a $2.00 fee - your ~$17.50 worth of BTC should have gotten you around 3400 XRP
Any way you slice it you should have received more. Also, btc2ripple.com may just be a scam service, I've never heard of it before.
24 XRP is worth ~$0.11
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:34:18
Too much risk for me, but best of luck to you.

Be careful, he might run a chargeback on that Bitcoin and then you wont be a holder any more!
Just kidding, not possible - welcome to the club
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:47:42
You said exactly how to do it, but to break it down:
1. You open your wallet and hit receive 
2. QR code will show up on the screen
3. He opens his wallet and hits send 
4. Inputs the amount to send 
5. Scanner will activate on his phone, he scans your QR code
6. You now control the coins in your wallet
7. ???
8. Profit

No, I have never heard of BitQuick before.
I like the idea, because I hate chargebacks (Ebay/Paypal)
I dislike that the website is loading slowly, maybe Reddit killed it? My other webpages are loading fine.
