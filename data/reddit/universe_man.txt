They must accept it in payment of any debt they wish to enforce against you. But of course they would accept the $100 bill long before they would file a claim in court.
Probably the clerk would make you hand over the soda and then throw it in the garbage.

I'm not refuting anything you say, but:
That's a ridiculous rule that goes unenforced on a daily basis. To suddenly enforce it against a mod who wants to raise discussion of a serious issue is completely asinine.

So for you, the most salient point of this story, in which two families' lives are made a living hell by the government, and they have to forfeit significant assets despite never being charged with a crime, is that they promoted MLM? Wow. I hope that if the government ever steals from you, no one finds a single aspect of your entire life objectionable. Because I would want them to be outraged at the government, and not turning a blind eye to corruption because you were involved in crypto or some other irrelevant fact.
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:38:06


That reason being that the government made a mistake. Or do you have an alternative theory about an article you didn't read?
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:03:38
It's incredible to me that people here are criticizing you because you were involved with MLM, or reply to Trump's tweets, or whatever other stupid reasons. Siding with the government over stealing people's money because of that. In a god damn crypto sub!
Corrupt governments that steal from people while others cheer them on because "it's okay if it's not me" is how nations go down the tubes. The only thing more depressing than your story is these idiots' reactions to it. Fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:36:56
Good question. I don't think you can be taxed on appreciation of the national currency, but I don't know what is the exact reason.
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:15:39
Yeah, but it's reasonable to assume any American doing a story on the US dollar owns US dollars. It's not reasonable to assume anyone doing a story on bitcoin owns bitcoin. A better analogy would be a stock. If you do a story on a publicly-traded company and you own the stock, you damn well better disclose that, and then you might as well not do the story because it's assumed you're not objective.

[IRS capital gains rules are written in plain English and available for anyone to read]( If you read them and still can't understand them, (which is unlikely for anyone intellectually curious enough to be involved in bitcoin), *then* call an attorney (an attorney familiar with bitcoin... yeah right). The long and short of it is, yes you owe taxes when you sell something for more than you paid for it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:01:40
Where do you get this information?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:28:44
Sure... but if bitcoin goes mainstream, it may never go below the current price.

Your argument seems predicated on the idea that no diversified portfolio is capable of providing a real, positive return, and therefore "fails." If you don't want to accept that even the best-performing major asset class -- the stock market, [which is up like 24% since June]( -- has provided a real, positive return, then I can see why you would be under the impression that you must take big risks to keep from getting poor.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:55:56
Well said. Anyone with a significant portion of their wealth in BTC who is not taking *any* profit at these prices has become hypnotized by the numbers.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:24:54
Just remember, no one ever went broke from taking a profit.
The best "speculators" have already made tremendous gains and are now selling bitcoins a tiny bit every day. They'll never dream of buying bitcoins.
Anybody laughing at those people is a damn fool.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:13:24
No risk, no return.

I honestly don't know what's more unnerving -- a government that's terrified of bitcoin, or a government that is excited about bitcoin.
An establishment senator has no interest in anything but the status quo. He should want to shut bitcoin down. Why doesn't he?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:09:30
Yup, nothing but bitcoin is worth owning ever again! Diversifying is for idiots!
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:37:41
For example, if it's publicly known that she owns bitcoin, and she creates a story touting bitcoin as big and important, people could say she was motivated by personal gain.
I'm sure there are many other examples.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:33:30
You have correctly identified the topic being discussed: tax evasion.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:29:23
You present a good argument for why it is immoral for the government to impose a tax on the event. Unfortunately, that is not an argument for the notion that the imposition does not exist.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:59:18
You're right of course, but it's probably more accurate to say "correction" than "crash." (And maybe people wouldn't downvote you for saying something that is obviously true.) All bull markets have corrections. So many bitcoin investors are so new to investing that the thought of a correction is terrifying to them. They don't understand it's normal. So they cover their ears and sing lalala when someone says it's coming.

Maybe he bought em during the bubble and they're worth less now. Doesn't matter. They're worth what they're worth. He gave away $1746, period.

That statement assumes that those "big, calculated risks" prove to be the right move. There's no law of the universe that prevents every single big risk you ever take from being a *wrong* bet. Then you've "lost out to" people who simply diversified... in fact, in that case, you're worse off than if you had kept your money under your mattress.


Not necessarily. Treasury bonds are negative. Savings accounts are negative. The stock market in the past year is positive.

Hey, my first tip! Thanks, buddy! I'll be a tipper too now.

That's a good way to do it. Yes, bitcoin is or will be a bubble. That's what investments do. Whether that's now or years from now remains to be seen.
My strategy is to have 1% of my liquid investments in bitcoin. As of now, I'm still a buyer. At this rate, I may sell pretty soon.

First I saw a link to was near the top of And I was sad.
Then I saw people posting their addresses (in this thread, mind you, not even the original thread).
And I decided to commit suicide.
Goodbye, Reddit. Your stupidity has made it so that I literally cannot bear go on living.
I will give one bitcoin to everyone who replies to this post until they're gone, then I suck on my 12-gauge.

I have to disagree with the philosophy that Bitcoin should be the only currency forever. Failure of currencies and adoption of new ones happens repeatedly, everywhere.
I also disagree with the notion that people using litecoin would create turmoil akin to the initial adoption of bitcoin.
I think there should be robust competition in currencies.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:20:58
Interesting thoughts. You may be right.
But I would still remind the newly-rich of this: No one ever went broke from taking a profit.

People are idiots, including your parents.
Sometimes people do nice things for idiots. Sometimes they don't.
Sometimes people get screwed by money. Sometimes they get blessed by it. Of course it's due partly to good or bad decisions, but it's also due to random chance. Anyone could be poor due to choices or luck, and anyone could be rich for the same reasons.
Don't make the decision based on what they did or didn't do to you in the past. Make the decision based on what you think will be the better outcome.

I wonder how many people said that about tech stocks in 2000 or condos in 2006.
I'm not saying it's a bubble. I'm saying don't fool yourself into believing it CAN'T be a bubble.
