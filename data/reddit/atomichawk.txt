Oh, this is new to me, Ill definitely invest now!
Although I'm still interested if there's other currencies out there!
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:29:25
I was joking, sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:58:13
Alright thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:29:06
Uhh, I'm still downloading my wallet and the chain lock thing. Could you do it later? Sorry!
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:11:37
Cool thanks!

Oh ok. I'm in high school but I only have a basic understanding about how trading bitcoin works. I understand how bitcoins are made price kept track of, just wondering if anything else was out there cause it'd be nice to sit on it for the four years I'm here in high school and have something for college if its price rose like bitcoins did.
In all honesty it was a stretch of an idea but figured it couldn't hurt.
On another note, I've been trying to find a guide that explains how to group mine in a pool and can't find anything that really clear, any help here?

Where do I sign up?

I don't mind if they don't have advantages, just if their cheaper, unless that's what you meant?
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:01:23
Ok that makes sense, I definitely stay away from now, thanks!

Sorry I should've been more specific.
I know how and where to wire the money, just which website to wire it to, bit floor or block chain.
And I understand how it works, just not this step. Would it be fair to say I shouldn't open a bank account because I don't understand a few parts on my own? No, that's why I'm asking.

Oh good, thanks!

I know there's risk involved just like every investment, I figured if I bought say $20 worth of an alternate cryptocurrency with each being a few scents it could be big after a few years with minimal investment.

Would you say any of those are as reliable as bitcoin or close? Plus what's this about a troll box and chirukun?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:24:40
I think your in the wrong post? If not do you care to explain your answer?
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:58:16
Thanks for the great explanation! 
But with lite coin, what do you mean it's a fork? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:41:21
Those were public documents for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:14:20
I would just be hoping to hit it lucky and cash out long term.

Everyone's a millionaire!
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:00:05
How does it prevent seizure?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:51:40
So the exchange will give me a personal address to use after I buy my first coins?
