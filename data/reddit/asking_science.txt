* Get local businesses to accept bitcoin from customers
* Buy a little or lots of bitcoin
* Get customers to install wallets on their phones
* Sell bitcoins to businesses and customers, or give it away
* Encourage customers to trade using bitcoin at businesses
* Encourage businesses to do business with other businesses using bitcoin
* Use this scenario as example to expand to other businesses and their customers
How is bitcoin introduced to your economy? Who brings it into your community? There must be a source, there must be an outlet, it must be a river and not a dam.

Not a complete solution, just maybe something to add to the mix: If you can't attach a printer to your box, keep in mind that your already-built-in (generic) printer driver will be able to print to a file, rather than the printer itself. That file can then be copied to another machine, where it is simply sent to the printer for printing.

Inspired by something I said in a comment, I made [this]( a while ago.
[Here]( is the SVG file encoded in a PNG (read pixel rgb channel (r, g or b) as byte value from top left to bottom right and just chop off the red pixels, which are not part of the byte sequence).
I'm having fun. [Here]( is the same file, but this time the bytes are stored in r,g and b channels, so it is read rgbrgbrgb...

I'm not an expert.


An *African* bank. Crucial difference.
In and throughout Africa, a **LOT** of capital flows through micro transactions facilitated by, for example, [Mxit]( (a social chat platform with its own in-app currency), *various* (mobile) USSD-based services, micro-lending, casual vendoring, and the likes. A universal, decentralized currency will flourish given the right circumstances, because there are masses upon masses of people here who would love to use it and have already been using somewhat similar systems for years. However simply I put it, it remains a sticky, complicated matter. An established, respected bank like Standard Bank can help make BIG things happen. Those fat capitalist pigs are being heroic pioneers for once. Also, expect a barrage of Nigerian Princes looking to assist you with your BTC investments as news of this spreads up north.

You're underestimating how deceitful, corrupt, powerful and influential some people and organizations are. Also, *you* are in fact part of a group [of adopters/supporters] who ultimately strive to "define" bitcoin; or, in your words, to be viewed in a 'certain way' (whatever your favourite idealism might be) simply by virtue of your (polarised) participation in the process.

Everybody responds "like it does now". I don't get it. Doesn't "now" require, no, *demand* centralization and top-down oversight? How does a decentralized economy perform centralized functions without recreating all the shit we have now all over again?

I have to agree wholeheartedly, and that's why I've moved (far) away from Reddit's bitcoin environment and onto much more mature, level-headed forums. I'm glad someone said what many think. A few months ago I would have recommended Reddit as a pretty fair source on bitcoin info, but I'd be far too embarrassed to do that now. Reddit makes bitcoin (et al) look like just another internet meme, which is kinda sad, but meh.

This is actually wonderful news.
The fewer online porn, gambling and silk road type sites "accepting bitcoin", the fewer normal people will associate bitcoin with sleazy, creepy shit like that. Porn and gambling does bitcoin's already fragile public image no good whatsoever.

Many years ago there was no such thing as money. Then, money. Some years ago there was no such thing as the internet. Then, then internet. The twain are *yet* to meet.
Many years from now, there will be no money - at least not in the way it exists today. Whatever it will be, it will be *more* like what bitcoin is now and *less* like paper and metal and 'plastic' money and banks and stuff. Bitcoin itself has historic predecessors, and it too probably will evolve into something as yet unfamiliar.
There's nothing to change my mind about. I'd have to loose my mind to dismiss bitcoin and what it represents, and I'd be darned if I am not to partake in this experiment.
I often wonder what life would have been like if I were one of those first pioneers to set foot on new, uncharted lands, because those days are forever over. No-one will ever discover any new continents ever again. That said, there's still a lot of exploration for mankind to do, albeit sometimes in worlds overlapping the border between reality and virtuality. *This* is *our* opportunity to be pioneers, discoverers of new ways, and to be torch carriers for those afraid of the dark.

Hypothesis: Mark K *initially* planned to con everyone (plan A), but then realized he'd get just as wealthy, or wealthier, doing *legitimate* business, but his initial plan was already set in motion and he was trying to undo all of that when the "malleability flaw" unexpectedly happened, derailing his plan B.

Yes...but *which* foreign entity? Surely if you need to declare a currency foreign, you're going to have to specify the country of origin. If the "it's not from around here" argument stands, then it may well be declared an "alien currency".
