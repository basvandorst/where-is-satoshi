It can be hard to but a lot of Bitcoin with credit card

For that, you might need a Bitcoin debit card unless the store accepts "pure" Bitcoin. Some stores might accept "pure" Bitcoin, in that case, you usually scan a QR code with a mobile Bitcoin wallet and send the required amount. Examples of Bitcoin debit cards are BitPay visa debit card for US and Cryptopay visa debit card for EU. Also, remember that such small Bitcoin transactions may never confirm (at least when using "pure" Bitcoin).
So the only feasible way to really do this is to use a Bitcoin debit card but it kind of defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin and I wouldn't recommend it because it just empowers banks (in my opinion). For the normal user, I don't think it really matters. I've ordered a Cryptopay debit card myself and you use it just like a normal credit card. I use it for small amounts sometimes.

Well, I think it was pretty simple. The only hard was waiting. I do understand if it's not as straightforward for people who really don't understand.

Electrum for desktop is excellent but I agree the mobile app is bad. You could check Copay, it has very good desktop and mobile versions and is open-source.

What's hard about buying Bitcoin? Seriously?

Ok. My point still stands, it's not hard. I always just take clear pictures of my ID for any verification/KYC process and everything goes smoothly. I don't understand what's so hard. Pretty much everything is guided from wallet setup to buying Bitcoins for your wallet. I've gotten verified pretty much anywhere within 2 days.
 I don't live in the US, maybe it's harder there for some reason. I wouldn't know.
Waiting months? Lol. Most I've waited was 2 days and I've done a lot of transactions/purchases. Those people are either doing it wrong or are very unlucky.
