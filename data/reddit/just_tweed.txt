Not quite. r/btc is a lot angrier and seem to have a persecution complex. r/btcconspiracy would be a more apt name.

Isn't name calling what happens at r/btc though. Like, a lot?

Interesting qualifier. And I'm pretty sure I'm right. That sub seems to be 80% about shitting on this sub and bitcoin core or whatever.

Do you know what a rhetorical question is?

Generally speaking, in life I've found the more vitriol there is, the less substance the arguments behind it have.

 What's the reason not to? Why can't it be both? I'd like to have borderless e-money that I can use everywhere, easily, as well as it being a store of value. Ironically, a lot of people seem to be stuck in the past. This is not a gold vs cash debate.

Although gold being popular in jewellery is in large part (if not mostly) attributable to it being worth a lot. There is a reason for why people prefer diamonds before zirconia, for instance, even though there is no appreciable visual difference to an average person between the two.

I think you might have missed my point. It was that not much of golds actual "intrinsic value" is due to it's function as jewellery, imo. It's mostly perception. If gold became worthless tomorrow, very quickly gold would lose most of it's appeal as a material to make jewellery out of.

What. Bad use of something is the definition of waste. Quite literally.

You must be new to rational thought.
