Wtf? Of course I can spend my dollar in Europe. Dude, just stop.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:07:24
No one gives a damn right now if a store accepts Bitcoin. Why? Because everyone wants to profit off of it right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:31:29
You’re right, I can’t exchange my dollars for anything anymore...
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:37:37
So then crypto currencies are stable... until they’re not. Please see today’s price action.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:39:30
I’m just gonna say one last thing and then block you: You. Are. Fucking. Stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:16:44
Cryptos have become nothing more than the hopes and dreams of a bunch of suckers thinking they’ll become overnight millionaires. See yaaaaaa.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:06:54
Fiat is dead?! Please, keep adding humor to my day, I need it!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:27
How correct I am
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:47:13
What a toxic way of thinking, and it’s very indicative of someone who doesn’t actually invest. Do you have any idea how many chumps tell themselves “It’s only a paper loss” and never recover any of it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:57
Wow, you must know something we don’t! Oh wait, you don’t! You’re just a speculator like everyone else. GTFO.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:11:34
Then you didn’t actually read anything 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:05:48
Sure, that will happen... after loads of “investors” get wiped out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:03:18
I hope it crashes so people finally understand that they got lucky and that their “investing smarts” were based on nothing but hype. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:08:38
You’re an idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:31
I don’t encourage anyone to sell at the bottom or buy at the top, but let’s face it, people will be people and people are irrational. Also, the point that I was making is that you say it’s “only a paper loss,” but you’re also assuming that said asset will increase in value again; big assumption. Lastly, most people, if not all, are incapable calling a legitimate bottom or top. 
Edit: And don’t preach to me about 2008 and losses when you’re the one “investing” in a massively speculative “thing.”
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:50:41
You’re not an economist, lol. And if you are, you’re dead wrong and should probably find a new job.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:09:35
You have no idea what you’re talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:21
This is dot.com level bullshit. Considering how awful apps like Coinbase already are when it comes to buying, selling, and transferring, I can’t even begin to imagine the shit storm that will occur when this thing pops and people are trying to liquidate left and right.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:21
Salty? Not at all. What angers me is that so many people propagate this bs idea that it’s going to keep going and to “hodl.” It’s downright toxic behavior.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:10
You know why there will never be mass adoption? Because you assume that everyone can stomach the volatility. News flash, you’re wrong. Also, Bitcoin is finite in nature.
Wallstreet isn’t going anywhere, and you’re a fool if you think Bitcoin will somehow make it irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:38:10
Seems a bit hypocritical for you to be chastising me about how I’m using my time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:05:54
I love how everyone keeps using the term fiat instead of money. I get that it’s technically correct, but it just makes the poster sound like an absolute douche bag. In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if 99% of the people buying bitcoin JUST found out what fiat actually means
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:04:43
You think it’s because of the high transaction fees? You might want to take a look at the volatility...
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:05:47
Read your post again...
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:28:08
No, just looking to shut down know-it-alls like you 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:05:45
You’re a strange individual with poor reading comprehension. See ya.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:51:47
You’re not making a valid prediction at all. Your prediction is based on nothing.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:10:23
Supply and demand will normalize. Bitcoin will never, ever again hit the highs experienced in the past
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:13:19
Then if that's the case, Bitcoin will never be a real means of exchange
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:12:24
I'm sorry, you think there's going to be a run on the banks in less than two months? My God, this forum really is full of delusional idiots
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:39:51
Blame yourself for the obvious (poor) attempt at karma farming
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:29:11
You feel sorry for him? Sorry dude, crypto is done for the foreseeable future. The big players got their dough and sold it off to the cucks and dropped it big. 
This “dip” that everyone keeps talking about isn’t a dip, it’s pure value destruction.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:39:01
So you knowingly and willingly made a post using incomplete data, cool.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:43:58
Go make a better one? The onus is on you, buddy. You're the one who decided to make the post, not me.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:37:43
Uhhhh, wrong, dead fucking wrong
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:45:03
What the fuck is intip? That's not a word.
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:10:10
No, you posted misinformation. Your data isn't complete.
And the onus is on you because YOU chose to post the information. Ffs, are you seriously that thickheaded?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:05:51
So you can’t predict the bottom but guarantee that this will go back to $19,000 and beyond? Pathetic. You’re what’s wrong with crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:26:34
If you can't handle the volatility, then why did you invest $40k? I'm guessing you've looked at charts and saw how crazy past swings have been, no?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:05:19
That's absolute crap. Most people have bought into BTC and cryptos alike with the hope that they'll become overnight millionaires. Most of these people are desperate idiots, plain and simple.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:46:32
You never understood it in the first place... no one does.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:12:06
None of you can predict the bottom, and anyone here who uses past history to guarantee that BTC and cryptos will bounce back should be permanently banned.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:18:48
There is no logic. This has always been pure speculation and now the domino effect is in full swing. Hope you didn’t get suckered in by all the fools and pumpers.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:42:26
I predict it’ll hit one billion...
Please, these predictions are a joke
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:13:31
[Did someone say Pantera?!]( 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:25:12
Hahahaha, wtf? So what? The same can be said for currency or stock. That doesn't mean said "asset" is magically going to bounce back just because there was a buyer. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:31:50
You think “FUD” is bringing down the market? You don’t know that for sure.
