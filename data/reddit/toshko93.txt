Those Americans with their "we are the only country in the world" shit...
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:24
Yeah. No problem. Anyway I guess you're all just on the "let's make America great again" vibe still ��

Well take another point of view. In Korea Hollywood movies are banned (you get killed if you watch one). It's the same with china banning Bitcoin (without the death penalty :D).
That doesn't mean the rest of the world won't watch Hollywood movies or using Bitcoin.

I agree. No matter currency or financial asset people should still be more realistic. If it was meant to be currency by it's creator, but became asset because of how the people accepted it, so be it. The game changes, so you just learn the new rules. Not moan that it's not meant to be asset and ask if it can be a bubble ��

You think I can keep 70$ by the time of the fork there?

What do you mean it's price is far beyond it's value? What gives you the price? The demand. I could say the same for the gold for example. But that means that I think that the gold is overvalued. So if people give 5500+$ for a bitcoin. That means the demand has risen. We will see this in the next years with much bigger sums and people will still say it's overvalued.
Too much people that are involved in bitcoin. So even if some whales wanted to scam the market after a few years of rising  (their evil plan). People will still want the Bitcoin. The whales will cash out, but the sentiment and the technology will stay. Even if we leave the sentiment behind, we have the technology. You just think what are it's properties before you buy it right? 
Well in the case of gold we have that it's limited, supply is reduced over years and you can use it as a metal. 
In the case of Bitcoin we have the first two again. Plus the fact that you can fucking "teleport" that fucking "gold" wherever the fuck in the world you want and I still don't understand why the fuck people don't ask themselves the right questions?

It's called compound interest, and the whole world is aware of it ��

Would that be the same if I have sent like 50$? Not just test transaction of 0,50$ for test. Is it the same fee?

What's the worst thing that can happen to 40-100$ worth of BTC in Coinbase during the split? Do I lose?
