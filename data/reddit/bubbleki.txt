Wait until a currency collapse.

Most prisoners are in jail for non-violent drug offenses. Your indoctrination into socialistic religious fervor is evident.
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:14:25
You admit you have no idea what your talking about then? Your basically just telling me to have "faith" in your socialistic agenda.
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:36:24
You are religious in your blind devotion to an ideal you admit you know nothing about. If there is a gun involved in the transaction then it isn't free trade.
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:42:53
The sociopath part might be right but why are you lumping "capitalist" in there. Capitalism is nothing but the free trade among people without coercion. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:40:44
According to who? You must hang around a lot of sociopaths that pretend to like you. You are essentially asking for a dude with a gun to take half your shit to protect you from someone potentially taking half your shit.

Oh. Are you into the whole computer algorithm AI that will justly distribute all resources evenly?

Mastercard actually cares about me??? I'm expecting a Christmas card this year Mastercard.

"yes, but that means it will also pass away and give rise to another system"
This is faith based. Somehow socialism prevails. If you have freedom and people do as they see fit then you are essentially a free market capitalist. Socialism is the mandate that resources must be redistributed, usually at the point of a gun.
Your wrong. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:57:49
You know that socialism inevitably is just the concentration of power into the hands of the few to "redistribute resources" right? So who the fuck forced you to buy the computer your typing on?

This makes me so happy. Not the ripping off part but how bad companies will one and all, fall under the scrutiny of the customers. I&lt;3 theinternet.

I love how all these troll shills are here to help Mike Hearn declare bitcoin is dead. Believe not a single one of them.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:54:47
Except for the two billion unbanked right?

Centralization is on the agenda boys. They are swaying all of the incumbent merchants to push the block size increase to begin the centralization drive.

It is the logical consequence of their actions that there would be a resistance which wouldn't take too much brain power to realize and potentially exploit.

People smarter than you are working hard at it. The market demands an easier interface and the geniuses will make it so. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:40:42
The question is why. If they were that concerned they could just start another alt currency with a larger block size limit and blow Bitcoin out of the water. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:55:32
I think that might be the point.........
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:48:23
These people aren't stupid. They knew what the Fork and the XT would do to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:54:09
Right, because innovation doesn't exist.
@_date: 2015-11-09 18:13:34
It's a trap!

What really bakes my noodle is that they turn all this capitol, labor, goods and services into debt, which we now owe them.
