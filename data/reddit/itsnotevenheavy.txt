You got the money, concealed carry has the answer.

Which is why I said if you are going to do it take all the necessary steps for it. In my state you can get your permit and carry concealed or open without classes. 
I would never do that and until hours of experience in classes would  it even cross my mind to comfortable doing it. 
There are also laws that limit what you can and cannot do. 
Just saying 'KIDS THINK THEY ARE RAMBO LOL' is pretty ignorant of the point. 
You clearly rustled my jimmies. 
Have a good one and may your hodling be profitable, and your year be mooning.

No you fucking idiot. You obviously know nothing about what the training is. It is over five fucking hours each course in my state.
As for your last point...rule number four...know what you are aiming at AND WHAT IS BEHIND IT. 
You should take a course just to learn how dumb you are whether you intend to own a firearm or not. 
It takes a lot of responsibility to carry and if you knew anything about it, you might start understanding what goes into it. 
You really just went full retard...never go full retard.
