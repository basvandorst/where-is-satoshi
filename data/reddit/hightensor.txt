Cracking the encryption would allow someone to crack a private key associated with a btc address.
But the seed used to generate the private key would remain safe.
If enough people wanted to upgrade, a hard fork would occur at a specific block.
Then the owner of the wallet could use the same seed to generate a new private key for their addresses on the new forked chain.
So they would have funds on both chains. Depending on specifics the community would likely stop using the old chain.

Slightly more difficult, but not too much.
The apps ux are a little less polished because they are newer, and there is a little learning curve around setting up lightning channels. But it's getting easier every day as this video shows.
Setting it up via apps (zap, "bitcoin lighting wallet", eclair) is definitely the easiest route.
Still only use funds you are safe losing.. but every day it's more battle tested. I'd say lost funds risk is pretty damn low at this point, but understand there is still risk.
I recommend setting it up, the instant ~0 fee transactions are very exciting.

Yeah there are various ways to transfer between coins on/off lightning network.

Unlikely unless computers get increeeesibly fast.
But in that scenario, the encryption algorithm would be upgraded.
Some info on that:
If all types of encryption get busted.. that'd be an issue but that'd like break the internet

The trick is to publically announce you've lost your coins to a boating accident. ��

Criminals will exploit kyc too...
What happens if a database of kycdocunents are backed, then criminals use those documents to get through services like bitpay?
