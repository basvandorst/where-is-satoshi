Move to a paper wallet, hide paper in a balloon and tie a string of dental floss to the balloon. Tie the other end of floss to a tooth and swallow the balloon. Fly immediately to Switzerland and get a safety deposit box at a Swiss bank. Use the floss to fish the balloon from your stomach, and place it in the box. Then hid all the information to access this box in another balloon and go to Hong Kong, repeat what you did in Switzerland. Do it again with a few more banks around the world. Then make your last stop a nearby cemetery with a fresh grave. Take your last balloon and put it in a firesafe which you bury in the fresh grave. Tell nobody what you did.

I had stocks from 2000 through 2008. I still have them. There are some rules that you need to follow (it gets scary sometimes but you need to follow these rules). First never invest more than you can afford to lose. Second don't put all your eggs in one basket (make sure you still have enough cash to buy more if/when prices drop). Third once things go high enough to cover any fees and still make a profit, Place a stoploss, you can raise your stoploss but NEVER lower it.

In your case, go out of town, go to a bank that you've never used before, explain your situation and get a safety deposit box. (Telling them will help them set you up in a way that prevents someone from finding out you have it or gaining unauthorized access to it.) Move your coins to paper wallets, place the private keys in the safety deposit box.

Are you running a lightning network node yet?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:51:27
First of all not much. Second, you need to start using segwit, abandon anything that doesn't use it. Third, LN is available already, you need to set up your own node to use it and you can only use it in a limited capacity until others set up nodes.
The thing about decentralization is that nobody is in charge so you can't just sit on your ass and say "they" need to do this or that. There is no "they" only "we", only "I". If you want something to happen MAKE IT HAPPEN!

A bubble is any time the price is artificially inflated due to speculation rather than inherent value. Given the improvements in bitcoin infrastructure and the increase in the number of active users (not just traders), the price right now should probably be somewhere around $10,000 maybe slightly higher. But last month when the price barely crossed $9000 before surging up to $19,000 that was a bubble, that bubble popped.

Fees exist because of limited network supply and growing network demand. Bitcoin used to be free, or the fees were entirely voluntary and your transaction would be included in the next block whether you paid one or not. And blockchain network/coin/whatever that has more supply per block than it has demand will have low or no fees. In other words, your altcoins have low fees because nobody is using them.

The thing about Bcash is that it really is bitcoin, just as much as "bitcoin core" (as Judas calls it) is bitcoin. But to insist that either we call them "bitcoin cash" and "bitcoin core" or to say that Bcash should retain the primary name while the legacy fork gets a new one only serves to confuse people simple because of common usage.
When I say "Velcro" you probably imagine hook and loop tape even though Velcro also makes compression socks. While in a technical sense maybe it would be more correct to call one Velcro hook and loop tape and the other Velcro compression socks, in the practical world I can just call the more traditional one Velcro and specify only when I mean the other one. Same goes for bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

So what MtGox level catastrophe do you think is going to cause the crash. Because if you remember the reason it crashed last time was because there was only 1 good exchange to buy it.

While BCH currently has slightly lower fees (300 sat/byte vs 600 sat/byte) they also only have 105,000 tx/24h vs 3.5mil tx/24h. The bigger blocks do exactly nothing to help with the scaling that bitcoin needs while others currencies like Litecoin and Ethereum already service the need for a spendable currency. 
Essentially we need a Netflix moment to move Cryptocurrency to the next level and BCH is the Family Video to BTC's Blockbuster. (It's just a shittier version of what we already have)

That's not even close to true. The only time the correction was massive was after a 6000% increase in one year and the correction took it down about 60%. The next highest increase was around 1400% for a year and it was followed by another increase. If you look at the year end data [here]( you'll see that this massive surge is only the 3rd best year bitcoin has ever had and there's no indication that it will go down next year at all.

This is exactly the thing that frustrates me. There are a few places that actually do allow you to send and receive using segwit. But most of the "pro-segwit" posts say something along the lines of "things will be better once segwit gets more adoption". And I'm here thinking "You FOOL! You have everything you need to use segwit if you wanted to, You need to adopt it. Stop waiting for everyone else to force you to use it because if you do that, they never will."

Back in 2011 I set up my eeepc to mine because I didn't really know what it was but I heard about it on 4chan and decided to give it a shot. I set it up in my bedroom and forgot about it for almost 2 weeks. When I finally checked it I had 50btc in my wallet. I foolishly thought that meant I was earning about 25btc or about $750 per week. But then 2 things happened. 1, the bubble popped and my 50btc was only worth about $100 and 2, ... nothing happened... then nothing continued to happen... then I actually read how it all worked and realized I must have been really lucky and at some point while I wasn't watching it I mined 1 block. So I went through MtGox and cashed out.

It has to do with taxes. The government, which is the local organization with the largest enforcement force, says you must pay taxes on all your transactions. They also say they will only accept dollars as payment. That means for every transaction you make, you must have and set aside the appropriate amount of dollars. People tend to like to keep things simple, rather than trading with one currency for the trade and then also handling a second currency to cover taxes, its easier to just use the tax currency for everything. That means that as long as the US government is more or less a singular entity, and a world power, and they only accept dollars as payment for taxes, the dollar will be a dominant currency.
Given the state of the world... buy bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-10-27 16:42:24
Its based on the consumer price index. 3% inflation according to that means that the price of goods and services rose an average of 3% over the same time last year relative to the USD. Since the CPI doesn't change or the change is negligible against a stable currency then the price of bitcoin in USD should match inflation.

The house votes to impeach Trump and never goes anywhere in the senate because Mitch McConnell refuses to hold a vote. This serves as enough of a distraction for Trump to fail in his reelection campaign due to a lack of actual campaigning and ignoring issues like the economy. His neglect of the trade war leads to a decline in the economy and fears of a recession continue to grow. Meanwhile tensions continue to rise in the Kashmir region as both India and Pakistan begin threatening the use of nukes. A full blown civil war breaks out in Iraq with the US and Russia obviously supporting opposite sides. With most of the world's watchdog forces occupied, China marches troops into Hongkong and we suddenly stop hearing anything about protests... or the protesters.

Let's say I had $20 in coins and stopped by coinstar to buy bitcoin on my way to work. Someone said they take about 4% and the buy price is around $200 more than an exchange. So this morning when bitcoin was around $3600 I would buy $19.20 worth at $3800, or about 0.0050526316 BTC.
Now let's say I went to a bank instead. I'd have $20 in my account. Assuming my bank gives me instant access because its cash, I can then get on my phone and transfer it directly to an exchange where... I'll be able to buy bitcoin at whatever rate it happens to be at in 3 days. Meanwhile the current price is already higher than my initial coinstar price.

We all bought that pizza. Anybody that knew about bitcoin and thought about buying and bought anything else bought that pizza. Say you knew about bitcoin, wanted to buy some, say you even did buy bitcoin back in 2011, but you also spent $30 on a couple pizzas. Sure you didn't spend 10,000 btc on them, you spent $30 on them, but you could have spent that $30 on 10,000 btc instead... but you didn't. In fact, anything you spent money on instead of bitcoin could have gone to buying bitcoin. It's called opportunity cost. So remember next time you want to buy that frivolous thing, that money could be used to buy something that will increase in value instead and ask yourself which you want more, the value of that thing in a few years or that frivolous thing now.

Do this, go to an exchange, look at the depth chart for bitcoin. Look on the "buy" side (usually the green one on the left). Look for the price where you see the largest rise. That's the buy wall, momentum tends to get stopped by walls. If it keeps going down, you buy as close to the wall as you feel comfortable with (too close and your order won't get filled). Then pray that it stops there rather than breaking through. 
Edit: by placing a limit order of 30+ BTC you can become the wall.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:14:39

Ok "redditor for 3 days" here's how it works. Let's say I owe a car payment of $100 due on the 15th, I buy $100 worth of BTC at $5000 on the first. On the 15th BTC is $5500 so my $100 is now $110. I pay the $100 car payment and keep $10 worth of bitcoin which I move into cold storage. Even if it's more expensive every month as long as the price on the 15th is greater than the price on the first I end up spending less on my bills and saving moar. The earlier I start the moar I have in hodlings a year later. And it's all money I would have otherwise spent on a car payment. This works as long as the price keeps going up, even marginally.

So many people are afraid of losing money when "the bubble bursts" but every exchange I've used, whether it's for stocks or crypto, has something called a stoploss. It's not that hard to follow the price up and have the Stoploss trail behind the high by some safety margin, then when the price starts coming back down you cash out near the peak.

No, you're confusing pools with cloud mining. A pool is an organized group of miners that essentially agree to split the mining rewards they receive according to your share of hashing power. Cloud mining is where you "buy" hash power from their cloud (mining farm) and the rewards are split between the people who bought hash power. Although it's easy for someone to claim they have a mining farm and just run a ponzi scheme so maybe stay away from cloud mining. Pools are ok though.

Buy moar.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:34:37
In as much as I don't want the price to go down until after the fork so I can dump it and reinvest the profit into BTC. I also wouldn't mind if BTC drops a few points immediately after the fork so I can buy the dip.

It's currently down 0.31% from yesterday, nasdaq is down 1.27% from yesterday, autodesk stock is down 15.86% from yesterday. I wouldn't really call this a crash, even CNBC is saying "bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $11,000 today before pulling back slightly to near Sundays close around $9000"
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:56
I treat coinbase as a check account. I deposit my entire paycheck into coinbase at the beginning of the month. I use the shift debit card linked to my coinbase account to pay for things throughout the month. Then whatever is leftover at the end of the month gets moved to my paper wallet for safe keeping.

Yesterday on fast money they pointed out that bitcoin was well into the oversold range and Jim Kramer (while talking about another stock on mad money) said that if you were that far into oversold you should cash some out and wait for a pullback. There were several bitcoin tracking blogs that said it had gone up too far too fast. One of those blogs even said to expect a drop in the next few hours (posted at around 7am) down to 9400 with major support around 8500.
If this drop surprised you, you haven't been paying attention.

I get that we all agree that it's wrong for someone to just "print" more money (in this case USDT) and use it to buy bitcoin... but what I don't get is how them doing it is any different from government backed banks just printing more fiat currency and people using that to buy bitcoin.

Gold is worthless as a store of value because you can't use it for trade when your economy collapses.
When the German economy collapsed people went back to a barter system for a time, when the Russian economy collapsed people went back to a barter system, now in Venezuela and Zimbabwe people are using a barter system. During the great depression people used a barter system... starving people don't want gold, but they'll gladly paint a barn for a few sacks of grain and some eggs.

Scalability is fixed by using another more scalable, lower fee currency. I would like to think of Ethereum as the cash of the future because it's much more suited for that on a large scale. While bitcoin is the future equivalent to premodern gold. In that you determine the value of your Ethereum in terms of how much bitcoin you can trade it for, and there is a fixed maximum number of bitcoins.

The argument about whether it's a mathematical structure parsed by software or a software structure built by math calls back to an age old philosophy question. Is Mathematics a science? 
Science is the study of something that exists. Mathematics doesn't inherently exist on its own but was essentially invented by humans to describe the world. In many cases it's perfect for describing science. And anomalies in scientific measurements led to discoveries in math (such as e^(i*theta)=cos(theta)+i*sin(theta)... but if you can discover something that means it inherently exists and wasn't invented...

The abuse is that when they sell $10B bitcoin, they aren't real. The exchanges see it, but nothing actually get transferred. Then they buy a bunch while the price is artificially low and right before they would have to transfer their fake coins they cancel it. They have a bunch at a discount and everyone that bought the fake coins gets screwed.

You don't get it do you. You only lose money if you sell at a loss. If you've been buying $100 a week for even 1 year, you're not just "still up" you're way up. If you've been doing it for 2 years and don't plan on selling for another 20, this dip is hardly a blip on the radar. 
Think longer term, my roommate has been putting about $10 a week in since it was $30. He bought when it went up to 1000 he bought when it came back down to 250ish, he bought at 19,000 and he's buying now at 8000. He's 31 and says he'll keep doing this until he retires.

The law says you must stop at a red light and wait for it to turn green before proceeding straight through the intersection. It also allows you to make a right turn on red as long as you yield to all other traffic, and it allows you to make a u-turn under the same conditions, and turning right on green is also legal. If there is no traffic, I'll get a ticket if I blow through a red light, but I can circumvent this law by making a right turn, making a u-turn, then turning right again. The thing about the law is that it puts regulations on what you are allowed to do, but it says very little about intent, and certain other laws allow you to do what you want while avoiding certain restrictions placed by laws you wish to avoid breaking.

I'd also like to point out that Bitcoin is not tether but rather we call bitcoins value as a ratio relative to USD and USDT. So if there are only so many bitcoin and you increase the number of USD or USDT available, then you just increase that side of the ratio thus increasing the value of bitcoin. So I don't care who's printing money, so long as they keep doing it and I hodl my assets in BTC I win.

Owing taxes and failing to pay due to poor circumstances is an unfortunate accident and the IRS will let you go with just a fine in the way of added interest. Refusing to pay taxes despite having the means to pay is tax evasion which is a good way to end up in jail.
You'd be better off just using legal tax avoidance maneuvers such as wrapping your bitcoin trades in a self directed Roth IRA. You can place up to about $5000 annually of after tax income into the IRA, once it's in there you do all the trades you want without owing taxes... but you can't take it out until you're 59.5 years old.

Most investors aren't investors, they are simply people with money tied up in something.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:41:04
Me too, but we both know that's not going to happen.

They saw so many people getting rich and buying Lamborghinis and houses, they finally decided to see what it's all about and get rich too, but when they got in the price tanked to less than half its value.
They got rich quick, but when I tried to do the same thing they did I got poor quick. So it must be a scam.

If you can't let the value of $2000 drop below $1750, then you can only afford to invest $250 not $2000. Save the stuff you can't afford to lose. Play with the rest.

They are affected by the same market forces, but they are affected differently. There's no direct correlation though, it's more complicated than that.

This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:03:01
It has some nifty features so I like it. I can set it up so it won't show up in my apps, (though it's still in the app manager) so it's sort of hidden. Plus I can use segwit and set my own fees. Core can still do more, but until I find a wallet that I like that has native LN, I'll probably just use Samourai on my phone and Core on my computer.

For most of history money didn't go through a central bank of any kind and the economy was fine.

Can you adjust this to eliminate wallets &gt;5y that have never moved their bitcoin? Essentially eliminating known lost wallets.

My bitcoin balance only changes when I spend it or buy more.

Lol, "lower"

Put a bobblehead in the middle for bitcoin.

Find a good bank or credit union. Write the private key on a piece of paper, and keep that paper in a safety deposit box.

I have no "final position". A certain portion of each paycheck goes into bitcoin.

Be very afraid of people who have nothing left, they tend to be the ones who violently revolt and make guillotines.

When was the "breather" did something new happen?
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:35:53
My bad, I just bought a little. I should have warned you guys first.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:57:25
Nah, in two weeks it'll be $6000
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:25:11
I remember just last year, it was only during the final 2 months before the crash that it worked like that. If you bought at the beginning of January, 2 months later you're glad that you broke even. For most of the year if you only held for 2 months you'd be happy that you almost *almost* doubled your money. If you want to get rich in bitcoin you have to hodl at least 2 years, but you could say the same about a lot of things. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:45:16
I think that's right.
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:39:25
Good luck finding the real bottom. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:37:56
I can see that. Your user agreement looks very similar. Almost as if you are using the "crypto" brand to convince people that you aren't just more of the same banking system that we want to avoid in the first place. If the government or any other semblance of authority can seize the funds or interrupt the transactions then your on the wrong side of this. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:29:59
Stop looking for the bottom. If you like bitcoin and want to use it IRL think of this as a sale. If you see the thing you want and its 80% off, you buy it, maybe even buy extra. You don't say "I think I'll wait until its 85% off.
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:00:20

If you think 5g will have a significant effect on crypto, then you either have a serious misunderstanding of 5g, or crypto... or both. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:52:34
I'll buy my usual amount every month. If it goes down I'm happy because I can get more for less, if it goes up I'm happy because what I already have is worth more.

To be fair, I spent several hours yesterday screaming at my computer because I kept getting a bunch of errors while trying to set up a LN node. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:53:18
Just keep buying more. You'll be in the 21 million club before the next major bull run, and if not... you'll still have enough. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:38:14
It worked for me. I DCAed all the way down to 200 and back up into the 700s. I have some free cash again and started back up in the 6000s and will keep adding to my stash.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:15:44
Well... Ethereum does at least. That is, once they solve the scalability issues. Although my money is actually on someone figuring out how to add Ethereums advantages like multiple interoperable tokens and smart contracts to lighting before Ethereum effectively implements a scalability fix. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:10:00
Or you just DCA your way down. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:48:24
You called it 3 different things and still screwed it up. Its bcash.

This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:17:55
But... but I just saw an article about how bitcoin will quickly go to 0 as soon as the price drops below the cost to mine... nobody said anything about the cost subsequently dropping as fewer miners compete.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:50:02
But that's... that's Ethereum's territory 
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:33:13
Ah yes, they pay you in metal. It showed up, very quickly was worth about $13 and then lost 98% of its value. How about you don't try to shill for shitcoins on the r/bitcoin sub.

By using that service you are granting a secondary service called plaid access to your accounts, not only do they collect your login information including usernames and passwords to your bank accounts and giving them permission to transfer money out of your bank account, but (from their legal page)


In other words, you are giving the keys to a bunch of your money to a service you probably hadn't heard of or planned to.

Next project would be to make heat maps like this for each year for the past N or so years. Set them all to 1/N opacity and overlay them. See if a pattern emerges.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:42:41
No no no no. We're talking about the coinbase that pumped BCH to $3000 and then suspended trading while it crashed. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:11:32
No. The USD is currently nearly a global currency and yet the British Pound didn't have to crash for it to get there.
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:23:14
80?... I thought it was a solid 0.1 against bitcoin. *quickly checks coinbase* huh, guess it's finally dying. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:56:16
I had something come up and I couldn't buy at the beginning of the months like usual. I was swearing for the past couple weeks because I missed out. I'm just hoping this correction lasts until my next paycheck.
