I agree but what if you don't know the other party too well? It's gone!
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:54:59
Holy crap!!! Thank you so much!!
Wow really though, this was unexpected. Thanks a lot bud. Made my day much less of a headache.
I'll pass it on!
Thank you man.

Kinda on my own here :/
Good idea though
I mean I hope someone would know that I wouldn't scam them for $1 lol.
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:07:33
Oh so that makes sense. So only use it for family and friends pretty much.

ELI5 Why would they not? What are the cons?
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:14:47
Why don't you put it into a coin that has a higher risk but larger ROI?

Oh well I'm sorry to hear that. Well I mean I think there is small hate groups in every race/religion. But a small number of hateful white trash does not reflect every taxpayer ya know?

Sorry gotta call you on your BS here.
No white people (or any people), want to see people out getting killed by police.
I honestly don't think this was a race thing, more of an asshole cop thing.
Fuck cops man, don't be after races.
And you say 'their' tax dollars, referring to white people, but last time I checked, all races pay tax.
Come on man, how are white people to blame. It's the cops, and yeah maybe they're white, but that doesn't define a nation, or a race. 
What is BLM going to solve anyway? Nothing. I think all lives should matter.

Alright we all give coinbase a ton of shit (including me), but IMO they do a good job most of the time and make buying coins very easy for a lot of people. Yeah they could do stuff better but they're clearly trying. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:00:35
Coinbase counts more fam.
