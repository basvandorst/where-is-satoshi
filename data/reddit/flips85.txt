Supposedly, each logo variation encodes eight bit of information so that there are 32 bytes in total, and the private key could then be read out from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Is that correct?
Even so, there are factorial(8) ways to construct the bit pattern from these features and another 2^8 ways to decide what counts as "0" and "1". That allows more than 10 million combinations. Is it just about finding the right mapping, or is there any other clue that we are missing?

Well done, congrats! I also tried a lot but did not end up finding the right combination. Do you mind explaining your solution?

Thanks! I could verify the solution with your information (private key cac2c3...). I was missing the "from the 7th position" part. I had tried different orders (inverse, right-to-left, etc) but not starting from a different offset.

Thanks, for the nice puzzle!
The solution is a 256-bit private key: 6008c37d0aa226dbbe611be64106964bca6cbba7098fe4602a932c590e14b074. 
This was my thinking:
The "braille-like" dots in the bottom left spell "256" and indicate the nature of the key to be found. There are 32 blocks, so I assumed that each block represents 1 byte of the key. The public address is a vanity address, so it was very likely that the private key will be completely unstructured and random-looking. Each block is made of 16x16=256 pixels. It seemed reasonable to count the number of white pixels in each block, i.e., from top to bottom and left to right:
Every other block has horizontal lines (arranged in a checkerboard pattern). For those blocks, the order of the bits of the corresponding byte had to be reversed. This leads to the private key above.
Overall, I had tried a combination of bit-flips, bit-reversals, and/or counting black pixels, and all of those operations conditional on the pattern of either vertical, horizontal, or presence of both types of stripes. Together with four different orders of the blocks (left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and their inverses), my search space had a size of 4000 combinations. I looked for the private key that leads to the given public address with a Python script.
I don't see a significance of the vertical lines (distraction?) other than the order in which the pixels are filled within each block, but it was only the number of pixels that counted anyway.
If I may make a suggestion for future puzzles, it would to include some clue or mechanism that indicates whether one is on the right track. Given that private keys are unstructured, it was impossible to say which combination could work without computing the public address for each candidate.

I didn't follow up on the idea of reordering the blocks because there are two blocks in the second column that are identical (0x60). If there was information about the sequence encoded in the block pattern, it wouldn't be unique.

19th line should be '0101111' (not '0101000').
