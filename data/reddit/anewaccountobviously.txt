There are many international companies that have an electricity bill larger than the one of an entire country. Google, Microsoft and Amazon to name but a few. So no, noticing that is not as obvious as you might think.

I think we have a little misunderstanding. Maybe it was unclear, but I didn't mean to refer to the entire CO2 footprint of a person/worker. It's only to the extent to which it is related to the actual work being done for the bank. Doing so we don't need to think about opportunity costs and what ifs.

You seem to ignore the hidden costs of a bank. Even if it is an online-only bank it still requires a server farm, a backup data center, maintenance crew etc. And just because it's online-only doesn't mean that they have no physical presence. In fact, they are required by law. In addition to that, you seem to ignore all the other forms of resources that are required to power the infrastructure of a bank (fossil fuels for commuting workers driving by car, gas for heating etc.).
Also, please at least Google first before you're writing something. Take a look at this: [Sweden has low-cost hydroelectric power and much renewable energy supply which favors mining]( They tap into unused natural resources that are as green as it gets and would have otherwise remained unused. Mining comes not at the cost of households suffering from an energy shortage.

I wasn't trying to attack their decision from a legal point of view. It was more of an ethical consideration based on the principles and values of the constitution. It is paramount to set limits with respect to what the state can do and over what it has no saying.

Thanks! There are a lot of rapidly changing factors indeed. But I think the more you incorporate the more they even out - you get distortions in both directions.
I saw these papers as well. Unfortunately, not even half of the results are relevant. Also, one problem scientific literature faces is that is can take quite a while for a paper to be published. Recent trends and event are very unlike to be touched upon. That is why I wanted to include as many sources from outside the literature as possible.
And true, hearing that crypto consumes as much energy as a entire country might be shocking at first. That is why it is important to put it into perspective and compare it to similar services.

I never said that MS's power consumption of 2012 is larger than Bitcoin's of 2017. I simply said that there are some countries using less energy than MS. To prove me wrong you'd need to show that there is no country using less energy than MS. Regardless of that, thanks for the link!
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:47:28
Much appreciated! Thanks a lot.
I think part of why people are obsessed with this is that is seems a very easy and obvious target at first. However, many seem to completely forget and/or ignore the huge amounts of energy banks and other financial institutes require to keep their infrastructure running.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:34:26
I absolutely agree with you. Energy per transaction is key. But keep in mind, every employee has a CO2 footprint as well. That's not a unique thing to mining hardware. You need to take into consideration the entire infrastructure of, e.g., a bank that is required to keep it operational (from the office buildings down to the cafeteria). The more, the bank needs to keep records, backups and has its own data center. All things considered, there needs to be a factor some magnitudes of orders of magnitudes larger than 1000 to even come close to mining efficiency.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:57:47
It still a work in progress. I was just asking because it sounded like you had some concrete numbers on this one. As for alternative tech, I'm very much interested in that one. Can you link me some resources comparing the chains you mentioned to Bitcoin/Ethereum in terms of energy demand?
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:00:08
Yep, someone already sent me the link to that video. It's brilliant. One thing that most people seem to be ignorant of is that we already have a huge problem of storing surplus energy. Countries like Switzerland use the surplus to pump water into mountain water reservoirs just to prevent the grid from overloading during night time (in fact, the surplus is one of the biggest problem the energy industry faces today). They release the water again during the day and sell the energy produced for a higher price. Here, Bitcoin might offer a new way of dealing with an energy surplus during, e.g., the night, rendering new reservoir dams useless. This would also benefit the environment.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:00:49
No, your first point does not invalidate mine. All I was saying is that you need to take into consideration the CO2 footprint of every worker.
As for your second point, you're right. But I don't see how that contests the theory that cryptocurrencies need less energy than 'traditional' payment services.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:57:45
I'm interested in the alternatives you mentioned. You think of something specific?
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:09:45
Apart from flooding an entire valley and bringing the end to the local flora and fauna.
The more, I never said it was a way of storing energy. I was simply saying that it is a way of dealing with the surplus.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:07:00
Again, it's not an opinion out of the blue. I simply looked at the facts. I was skeptical at first but then had to change my mind.
The incorrect example I mentioned is in the CS report. It's this passage here: 
'Credit Suisse estimate that a bitcoin price of $50,000 – five times its level as I write – would increase the electricity consumption tenfold. And at a bitcoin price of $1.1m, it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in the world for mining.'
That is simply not true. Read the report for yourself. There is no such correlation of the scaling of the price and the energy needed. In fact, as adoption grows the new amount of energy needed levels off.

When it comes to banning mining, the only 'misuse of power' I can make out is the city deciding what the people can and cannot do with the electricity they pay for.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:13:30
Please, I beg you, can you provide sources/data for your claim. I had the same view as well but given the actual numbers I had to change my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:26:43
The only objective way in which you can use 'wasting' is when you have two systems with the same output but one requires more energy to maintain. That said, if PoW does the same as centralized payment network using fewer energy then there is no wasting energy at all. It's just what's needed to get the job done.
And yes, I completely agree with you. The companies you listed provide a wide arrange of services that crypto currencies don't. However, what you need to keep in mind is that they need a big infrastructure to do so. It requires a huge workforce, office building, server farms, backup data centers, lawyers and a myriad of other things that constantly draw power. Bitcoin doesn't.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:46:44
True. But as more and more miners join the network the incentives of mining get smaller. If the price goes up ten-fold the incentives of mining most certainly don't precisely because there is only a limited amount of energy available.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:21:34
We need to quantify that information. How much energy are you talking about? Also, it is too much with respect to what baseline? What is it that you are compare it to? Please help me understanding the point you are making.
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:56:29
Thanks a lot! Feel free to let me know if you find anything other interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:54:20
For sure! I listed it in my post in the part where I try to come up with a rough estimate of the future energy consumption. It will be most certainly one of the major factors that help Bitcoin succeed in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:28:13
Could you provide a source that track this over time?
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:50:44
When it comes to writing a paper you don't want it to be an opinion piece. That's the only problem I have - so, nothing's wrong with you having an opinion. In fact, quite the opposite is true. It's just that an opinion without the data supporting it doesn't bring you very far.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:39:15
So, I read the article. I already have all the sources he mentions. Unfortunately, it seems to me as if it is more of an opinion piece rather than statistical data that I'm looking for. Also, the math of the examples he gives don't really add up...
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:52:29
No that is not the case. I'm not saying that there is no situation or that there are no circumstances under which there is no compelling public interest in regulating energy production and use. You need to judge on a case by case basis. If there is a shortage of power then of course you can ban certain activities (like it was done with the use of water in dry summers). However, in the case presented above I don't see a compelling argument. To me it seems as arbitrary as banning the use of electricity to listen to music.  You can only speak of wasting energy if there is a comparable system doing the same job. All other uses of 'waste' simply reflect opinions.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:11:55
Worry not. I'm not beginning with the conclusion and then looking for facts supporting it. In fact, quite the opposite happened. I started my work on this topic quite a while ago and was very, very skeptic. However, the more data I gathered the more my initial point of view changed.
But I completely get your point. The wording of the post might suggest that I'm just now starting and that I'm favoring one side over the other.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:02:25
No, that is not the case. I already gathered a substantial amount of data and did the math. The intend behind this post is to find additional data that I might have missed.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:34:28
True. One problem that I have is that 'wasting' is a very derogative term, often used to discredit pioneering work. In fact, you could argue that NASA didn't waste anything for there was no comparable undertaking at the time - not even taking into consideration the inventions it spawned.
The main problem I have is that most critics don't put forward convincing data. For them, crypto is a wast of resources like, e.g.,  this or that hobby might be considered a waste of time.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:56:09
It's processed transactions. And to me it is irrelevant where the energy comes from. What matters is the amount. Although you could write a follow-up paper on that one :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:06:32
What do you mean by 'cost-per-bitcoin'? The more, it is important to remember that the mining is primarily a means to ensure security, the incentive to do so is getting coins as a reward. However, the creation of new coins is not correlated to the growth of the network as a whole. Also, the more people participate in mining the smaller the incentives to do so since the expected returns diminish. This is precisely because energy is not free and comes at a cost.
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:00:59
I absolutely agree with you. Sorry if I sounded like I was attacking your point that you were making.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:42:16
No, that one would go beyond the scope of a simple paper. What I want to compare is the energy consumption needed per transaction. And for that I need some rough estimates of how many resources a bank allocated to this type of service. I'm not interested in every aspect of their business, e.g., I ignore stock markets, mortgages, loans etc. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:05:33
Ok, so you accuse me of having an opinion then?
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:00:06
Fantastic! Thank you so much.
