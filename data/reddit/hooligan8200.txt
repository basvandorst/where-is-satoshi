Ethereum already does this. Check out [Siraj's video]( on how to build a decentralized application. He gives a really good high level description of all the moving parts and how they fit together building a decentralized internet. I don't think bitcoin has the required functionality yet, but it's coming over the next few years.

Only if its long term and under a certain amount though. Considering the past years performance, I'm going to guess that the 1500 was invested in the past year. If not, he definitely broke the 38k barrier since 1500 in Dec '16 was worth about 2 btc.
I'm also completely ignorant to how taxes are going to work with cryptos and looking for other peoples input. My taxes are going to look super messed up this year.

I don't understand this. OP asked about a decentralized internet and I gave a working example.

I remember seeing this, or a similar image late 2013 or early 2014. Might have been this exact one at the end of 2014. Extrapolating like this and the thought that 1 bitcoin could be worth $1k+ seemed ludicrous to me and is what turned me off of bitcoin initially. I really thought that the majority of bitcoiners were totally disconnected even though I did some mining for fun. Started hodlin' over the past few months though after doing my own research. Thanks for digging this up!

Nah it was a tiny amount I mined from my laptop GPU at the time. Like &lt;1 cent worth at the time. Pretty sure ASICs had already taken over by then.

Gold backed crypto? Just buy gold straight up.
This reminds me of a certain usd backed crypto...

Interesting. Do any of you bitcoin old timers know if the older bubbles had signs of a pump n dump? My guess is that it would have been very damaging early on, but now we've probably had a couple over the past month and the network seems more resilient.

Yep, but this is only likely to be solved once 1 satoshi approaches the value of small cheap items. I think it's around 1 cent now so still pretty useless. As far as the value of 1 whole btc and that mental barrier to entry, people will just need to educate themselves.
Edit: Wrong math, 1 satoshi = 0.01 cent. So extremely useless.

Yes. Say 1 satoshi becomes worth &gt;$1, then a hard fork could be implemented doubling the raw # of bitcoins in every wallet, but decreasing their value thereby every wallet has the same "purchasing power". Well... only if the new network is globally adopted. But also, I think that simply increasing the number of decimal places used would be easier. Think milli-satoshis.
