In the past I have transferred a decent amount to my bank account through them and all usually take at least 5 days I've never had one less than 5

Yea I'd like to have a 100% sure fire way to convert btc to cash. Without having to go through this medium. I did some googling and found that localbitcoins apparently is a good option. However you have to meet in person and my town isn't very big so idk how well that would work

What other ways are there to cash bitcoin into fiat from my private wallet? Other meaning not Coinbase as I have grown to believe they are shady

How dare you construct a theory without proper sourcing to prove its validity. One mustn’t think so broadly, stay in the box /s

I wish I could downvote this 100 times, one will have to suffice
