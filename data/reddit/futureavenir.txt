Fantastic question!  Think of it like this.  Coinmap is great for businesses.  But what about all the people in your neighborhood with skills and products that you might want to borrow or have?  This would be like coinmap for neighborhoods and the talents of those around you.  
Not to mention, you can try and convert everyone who lives around you.  If you offer a neighbor who is offering cleaning services to pay them in Bitcoin, unless they're technologically illiterate, I imagine they'd say yes.  They wouldn't be paying cash for it, so they wouldn't feel as invested, they'd just be doing something for you and in exchange, they get to try a new technology.
If you succeed in getting enough converts, you can get the stores nearby to start accepting Bitcoin and...and...you see where I'm going.  This can be a one more step towards getting mass penetration.

Doesn't it make sense to have a reputation system built into our economy?  That way the scam artists are weeded out and the hardest workers are recognized?  There would be more focus on collaboration and much less on competition.

The cost of the reward is generated the same way that the central bank generates money.  For the time being, JoatU won't be a crypto, but just a public ledger of currency generation going into people's accounts for doing things that benefit the community.
If others want to accept that currency, they are welcomed to.  If they do not want to accept it, that's completely up to them.  Obviously we can create some integral incentives for accepting the currency (e.g. deals with local businesses).

CAPS : Community Action PointS
CAPS are the currency used in the Jack of all trades Universe ([JoatU]( barter-exchange marketplace.  CAPS are currently generated at 1 unit per hour volunteered to the community. 
Community Offers (or Actions) are offers made to the community at large. If I am a horticulturist and I decide to spend 10 hours planting a publicly accessible community vegetable garden, I will be remunerated with 10 CAPS for my community work. I can then use these units at a later date as an added element of barter.
[JoatU]( mixes elements of local currencies and global currencies, focusing on local exchange at first with the possibility of introducing global exchanges in the mid-term.

To monopolize the flow of new bitcoin before making mining profitable again.  Short-term loss for long-term gain.
Step 1 - Buy up a lot of available Bitcoin
Step 2 - Increase cost of mining by driving down price of Bitcoin while increasing difficulty
Step 3 - Control a substantial portion of the outflow of Bitcoin
Step 4 - Drive prices back up to profit
I can't understand any other logic behind a 10% increase in mining difficulty every 12 days.  With the money spent on mining rigs, shouldn't they just be buying Bitcoin straight up?  Unless there's an ulterior motive...

Is Bob someone who has obtained a lot of credibility from the community and thus has access to many votes?
If so, this poses an issue.  It is obviously illegal to sell your vote, so we'd face the same problem but to an even grander level.  Now perhaps, instead of letting Bob know he has so many extra votes, to just let him believe he only has his own votes so that he can't be manipulated.  But once he votes with his vote, all the other votes follow suit.
If Bob is just a regular Joe, his vote is only worth one vote which isn't very special.  So can a Pharma company buy someone's vote?  Absolutely.  It would be just as easy to do that today.  And if Big Pharma all of a sudden has a lot of votes, I'm pretty sure there would be some sort of audit.
**Edit**: It's also important to imagine that I'm speaking about a governmental structure built on everyday people who are trusted within their communities.  No career politicians, only experts within their respective fields.  So it's not between two or three or eight politicians.  It's between hundreds or thousands of people with run-off votes.

Getting bitcoin to accept a significant update seems less likely than finding a workaround solution.
There are several solutions, some might be better than others.  Here's what I have in mind.
We would need an escrow service wallet where the people who join put their bitcoin in, and once they're verified, can spend any of that bitcoin instantly.  This would effectively be a bit like a bank service or portable wallet service.  It could charge merchants the same 1% that bitpay does to funds its operations.  In fact, I wouldn't be all too surprised if this isn't created within a month or two (or hasn't already been in the works for several).
Proof of identity account.  You send the bitcoin and simultaneously let the merchant scan a code that verifies that you are indeed you.  In this account, you have verified yourself through the standard ways and also included a credit card just in case the bitcoin you sent weren't in your account.  So as a backup, the company could call you, tell you that the bitcoin didn't go through, and let you know that your credit card account is going to be charged for this specific purchase.

Great questions.  I'm purely on the non-technical side, so I couldn't actually describe the manner to create an anonymous vote-sharing mechanism.  As for the coins, each series of coins could be linked to a verified [JoatU]( account.  
How exactly to do verification for this level of importance will be critical and that's still years away.  For now, people can join the system and generate currency using their direct-democratic practice and one account equals one vote.  Perhaps you can only vote after you receive a review from someone who has been verified.  Similar to the vouching system in couchsurfing.
I have read your idea and it's a bit over my head technically.  I'd love to hear how you imagine it working if the members of the society already have JoatU accounts (that have multiple credible references) and are already generating JoatU through these accounts.
I imagine a society that feels empowered to generate their own currency would feel empowered enough to organize their own community.  That's the long-term theory anyhow.

Want to imagine that a step further?  Mix in [liquid democracy](  So now, each person has a coin for each type of decision category that exists.  You have an education coin and a structural integrity coin and a medical coin, etc etc.  
Every topic that would need people making governmental style decisions would have a specific coin attributed to it.  Each citizen would have one of each of these coins.
Now let's say I have confidence in my old prof about education, so I send him my education coin and it's up to him to vote in his best interests with twice as much voting power.  Now let's say he starts losing his mind and I don't trust him anymore, I pull back the coin and hold onto it or give it to someone else.
You can also put aside the idea of representational democracy.  We have decision-making individuals (or groups) that would be the person holding the most coins for their category.  And if they lose the confidence of the people, they lose their positions.
P.S. I'm currently building a [system]( that could eventually facilitate a voting system like this.

I imagined this idea before I even knew what Bitcoin could do and since then I've been dreaming of different incorporation methods.
We could also make it like this:  We generate a batch of new coins to each person for each vote.  You can have it auto-send to somebody else or you can have it set manually and decide for each vote if you want to do it yourself (vote) or whether you want someone else to vote in your place.

Would you like to tell me which part of the system is a failure as opposed to overarching generalizations?  I'm presenting a two-tiered economic model, so I believe you may not actually understand what I'm presenting.
Individual offers are determined by two negotiating parties.
Community offers generate a unit of currency determined by the community as they are the ones who will benefit.
Perhaps you do not believe in the second aspect of the community currency creation, but the first (one-on-one individual offers) is entirely based on laissez-faire capitalism with no intervention whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:51:27
The price isn't determined, the currency needed to be generated for a specific event is generated.  200 people vote, order them from smallest vote to biggest vote, take votes  add those 20 together, divide by 20, obtain a number.  This number is the amount that will appear in the account.  If you think the term "democratic" is inappropriate, let's use the term participatory if you'd prefer.
I have no interest in semantic debates on what the process is called, just in how it functions.
Edit: If you were one of the people that threw a downvote at this, would you mind removing it so we could have a larger discussion about this? I'm not afraid of people have dissenting views, but if those views forbid new people from entering the discussion, it is frankly disheartening.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:46:53
I wasn't aiming for global or national (at least to start).  Conceptually, it would be community groups of just a few hundred people who are geographically close to one another and who have met nearly everybody within the group.  These groups would then scale up, making decisions that need to be taken for larger territories.
It becomes a question of politics at this point too.  Do we want decision making bodies for tens (or hundreds) of millions of people?  Is it effective?  Would bottom-up local politics handle themselves better than overarching national-level politics?  I personally believe so.  Voting for a city councilor who makes a promise to build a garden and only won by 2000 votes is a lot more likely to fulfill his duty than a president who won by hundreds of thousands of votes.  The accountability is closer to home.
Ultimately though, the idea would be achieving as close to self-sustaining systems as possible and through a mesh of community networks trading amongst themselves, we could have it.
