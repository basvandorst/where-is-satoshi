I use LBC on vpn but will def me making an account on paxful. looks like a step in the right direction and lots of buys already. Will get a few folks in Munich on here.

Met these dudes. One of the most solid and legit players out there. These guys know gold and are dedicated to doing things right.
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:33:03
These guys r tryin real hard and we should support them
I signed up waiting to spend btc in bushwick
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:30:32
All the lies counting til morning??? Lol
We got some bitcoin hatin shills up in ere!
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:39:14
makes a lot of sense. 
The guys at easybitz are giving away 100 Bits card wallets to introduce people to Bitcoin. Brilliant idea.
the whole 1 bitcoin thing isa huge psychological barrier to entry for most people.

I think the other song is xenoblade.. not sure tho...
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:00:18
If other languages r ok. I'll get some hungarian models I know to post this up. will translate "bitcoin is real money" in hungarian lol.
would be sick to hear hungarian models read the bitcoin whitepaper.
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:09:44
nope. skinny model girls. pretty sweet girls actually. one a geek
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:44:30
very awesome.
nice video. should be simple enough for anyone to accept bitcoin now. dudes in India and Africa can get btc now.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:55:13
Love it!!!
More of this we need yes..
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:29:21
Vid sent. emailed a few friends. good luck bros. looks sweet!
@_date: 2014-11-16 03:49:10
Who cares if they kept the bitcoin! 
$500 is alot! They know bitcoin is for real now!
If one place does it the whole neighborhood may follow!
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:28:48
Lose the tinfoil hat dude. These guys got a nice restaurant in nyc to take bitcoin, had a meetup and made a video.
Why is that bad???
I have bitcoin and stuff like this makes it worth more. Imagine if every restaurant in nyc took bitcoin.
Would be awesome. Props to these guys!
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:53:28
NICE! list.
I got click jacked once, just retweeted something on twitter but couldn've been alot worsre. curious as to how it would work on a bitcoin site? how would they get the iframe onto your page? would have to be via xss, which u also mention. right?
i imagine you guys are like local bitcoins right, buy bitcoin fast from folks round the world? Can I buy now and do u have any people in Argentina?
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:35:31
Been tellin the easybitzguys this for awhile
They r workin on it
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:14:17
it takes a day to withdraw right? last time i tried to withdraw this way I couldn't do it at all. anyone?
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:28:42
Love this. This is what bitcoin was meant to do, free the people and give us all a choice. I am sure the process will get smoother in time but for now, awesome job! kudos for patience!
big ups for 2steps from hell tracks. they are my fav band!!!
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:57:03
some truth to this but not completely fair. there needs to be a legit brokerage in nyc as the common folks are not gonna deal with a full blown exchange.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:32:34
prob a competitor. i notice extreme hate on the wallets guess exchanges too.
1. localbitcoins
2. bitquick
either one of those.
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:23:17
yup. huge really.. and from an "open source" community... sigh
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:24:56
haha. they broke the rules for sending tweets? what buttcoin hole did u crawl out from?
keep on going paxful u know you are doin something rite!
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:14:05
yup. they are trying at least to do something.
@_date: 2015-08-24 06:32:21
I'm paxful too it seems. hilarious this guy. wonder how many troll accounts he's got. nigger_loaf is def one of them.
@_date: 2015-07-20 10:32:03
yeah, your rite.
i just think these guys can do better. paxful is a real breath of fresh air. i think they have some serious potential to really take bitcoin to the next level. lbc and the like are just dragging us down with slime and scams. 
We need a fresh new face on things with zero room for error. they should eject all the green traders and only let veterans in. 
looks like they already have an army of haters jealous of their success so they gotta be perfect and not blow it! I'm makin' good coin trading on pax and wanna keep it going.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:19:52
circle? lol u think these backpagers wanna linker their bank accounts upload selfies and wait 5 days? do you even know what thread ur in ?
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:15:41
u know how lame it looks spamming a thread? seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:43:56
buttcoin ?
these guys are actually taking the lead in helping newbies out, on the phone. I got like 60+ orders there from the ladies. pretty darn real.
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:56:04
is this a joke? sites like LBC live off this stuff. The op said pax were gonna refund him his fee so they don't make profit from this. def buttcoin
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:55:01
already knew these things. if anyone doesn't they should NOT be selling bitcion to people they don't know. 
You should have a big ole form asking potential sellers to agree to the risks and educate them as to the risks. Scammers are always a step ahead because they share their info, kinda like a social network. Legit traders need the same damn thing.
get to work. articles like above won't cut it.
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:28:08
this is most likely bitquick as i don't think localbitcoins would stoop this low. they actually make money.
either that or it is some insane buttcoin posse
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:26:38
This is a worthy point! Sounds like they allow free form payment methods so anything goes which is great for the global scene but they should manually approve stuff for the usa to cut down on scams. A little regulation in the right direction isnt a bad thing. Thoughts ?
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:17:39
Makes perfect sense!
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:24:21
I do alot of trades on local bitcoins and am def interested in early access. Looks like just what we need. I suggest you have a more robust im msg system and prove the feedback system. Scene really needs some leveling up here.
Count me in.
