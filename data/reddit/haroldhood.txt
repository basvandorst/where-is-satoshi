Why use this over USD?
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:21:40
WELL IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT BITCOIN, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT NOW YOU CAN BUY GAMES ON STEAM AND THE GOD DAMN DIRTY GOVERNMENT CAN'T TRACK YOUR PURCHASES.
WAKE UP SHEEPLE.

Why will these people suddenly decide that instead of using a credit card, which is working well, they should buy a bunch of bitcoins, pay a transaction fee, wait several days for coins, and use these to pay for their stupid games?
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:23:12
Seriously you don't know? You should probably invest more before may 10th. Bitcoin is POISED for something huge. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:54:24
I probably won't get a real answer unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:07:23
You say I'm silly, but also say I'm correct.


Why would a single one of those parents get him a Bitcoin instead of a pre-paid debit card? The debit card will have value in 6 months. The bitcoin? Nobody knows. Since it is a currency who's value is predominantly based off of media speculation, if there becomes a new trend, bitcoin goes kersplat. It doesn't even have the Silk Road keeping it afloat.

Ok hypothetically you have family in Mexico. You give them 1 bitcoin.
Now how do they turn that to cash?
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:19:39
I constantly mock bitcoin I want free coin!
Check my post history, told someone bitcoin is silly on r/buffalo the other day
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:11:49
Idiot. I don't want the government tracking my burger consumption. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:23:27
The $ looks relatively stable over time.
Bitcoin had a giant surge when it gathered media attention, now it's old hat and will be worth nothing in a year.
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:13:08
The dealer is going to take them and convert them directly into cash.
What is the point of going in such a roundabout method of paying?
It is like converting your USD to Euros to pay the dealer then he immediately converts them back to USD. The only person happy is the currency exchanger getting their rake.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:18:28
Just sell the bitcoins for real money and buy the car. If they were to accept bitcoin, they would just be immediately transferring it to cash anyhow.

This is what's really holding bitcoin back.
Maybe it's state by state, but Gemini never even asked for my ID. I just did an ACH transaction from my bank and voila. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:21:20
You guys suck. I uploaded my ID, then verified my bank, then was told to reupload my ID, which I wasn't able to do. After a series of emails back and forth, eventually it was relayed to me that the service for uploading IDs was down, and would be available in several weeks. 
In 3 days Gemini verified my bank account, bought me btc and I moved on. 
If you are new to bitcoin, don't waste your time with coinbase.

Gemini didn't ask for my ID. I don't know why they would or would not require it.
Coinbase requires ID verification. But for the last 2 weeks their ID verification has been down, and it continues to be down.
This was the response I FINALLY got, after back and forth emailing for weeks;
"This is a problem our engineers are aware of.
I don’t have an ETA on when this could be fixed, but obviously the sooner the better. Sometimes fixes like this can take days, and other times it can take weeks."
You can look on Reddit, and other new users were having similar issues. It was exceptionally frustrating because I had already uploaded by ID, and it was approved, but it just kept asking me again and again for the same thing.
As I said, I'm a noob. I just wanted to play some online poker. Apparently, other users complain about buying/selling on Coinbase to be super slow. Idk about any of that.
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:35:53
I'm a noob too.
If you don't currently have an open account with verified ID on Coinbase, it will take weeks/months before you are able to deposit any money onto your account.
Save yourself the hassle and open a Gemini account.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:52:39
Yep. It's down indefinitely. Support sucks. 
Make a Gemini account. Easy peasy. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:30:24
Yeah your 85 and on the Internet, cool. 
Minimum wage is $8 now most places. What was it then?
Bitcoin is depreciating steadily as hell and at a rate of nearly 50% a year. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:44:10
The dollar chart seemed to steady itself. Bitcoin still has a negative slope.
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:42:14
Because in 20 years US currency will probably hold value.
Why put in the bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-30 02:52:39
You can say that of plenty of penny stocks after their explosion and pump and dump. 
are you familiar with the greater fool theory?
Bitcoin is interesting as a currency but it is a garbage investment. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:05:56
200 years later and it still has value. Let's see what Bitcoin is in 2 years.

That is some horseshit. I just built a PC using Amazon, Newegg and TD. Or attempted too. I bought half the parts from amazon and half from newegg. Nothing from TD.
