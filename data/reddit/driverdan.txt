GAW also just screwed all of their hosted hardware customers. Before they created their cloud hosting Ponzi they actually sold hardware. When their rebranded Zeus scrypt ASICs came out they offered free hosting for life. This was real hardware users controlled and could mine against any pool.
A few days ago they shut down everything without prior notice. They offered everyone two options: ZenHashlets (worth about 15% of the original hardware purchase price, if you think they're worth anything) or hardware shipped to them. They also said they'd pay out an arbitrary amount of BTC to people instead of shipping hardware at their discretion.
This completely screwed most people because they don't want to or can't host the hardware or have electric costs that are too high to run them profitably.

@_date: 2014-01-31 17:18:51
Maybe. IANAL but it seems it would depend on how it was structured. For example, if you rent the actual hardware out (or virtualized hardware) that the user then manages and uses to mine whatever they want you would not be a money transmitter. This would be like any other cloud hosting service where the user can put the hardware to any use they like.
Contract mining and fractional / share based mining would be a grey area, possibly needing licensing depending on how it's structured. It will need additional clarification.
One way around this would be to form a legal cooperative corporation where everyone has partial ownership. They specifically stated in this clarification that payouts to corporate equity holders is allowed.

You're right, GAW hasn't provided photos of anything. They showed some photos of a small amount of hosted mining hardware. I estimated the output of the hardware in the photos yesterday and IIRC it was something like 3Gh scrypt and 10Th SHA256. This is most likely existing hosted hardware from before Zen. They never posted pics of that hardware either but we know it exists since the owners control it and point it to any pool they want.
The returns they are claiming for their ZenPool are literally impossible. There is nothing scrypt-based to mine that can earn that much, including rentals.
They haven't provided a single shred of evidence that any "hardware" listed under ZenMiner is real. Multiple pool owners have claimed that they have received no hashing power from GAWZen.

Yes, eyes. The pen is useless and has nothing to do with UV. It tests the acidity of the paper which is something that's easily faked. The quick basic tests are
* Look for the watermark and confirm it matches the printed portrait
* Look for the strip embedded in the bill and confirm it matches the bill's denomination
* Feel the gold denomination in the bottom right to ensure it's raised
If a modern US bill passes those it's almost certainly genuine. There are additional things you can check, like the print quality and paper texture, but the watermark and strip are the hardest features to reproduce.

Much of what banks do involves calculating risks. The cost of risk in this case is most likely a fixed overhead plus a percentage of the money held. Even if it's a very low percentage it could still be a significant amount when you're dealing with 9-11 figure balances.
