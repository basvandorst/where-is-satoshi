Removal of the word "just" would require M5 or better, so we better get the situation straight here!
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:56:14
Exactly.  Sorry to be so blunt but the red flags are there...
- Guaranteeing rates of return that are astronomical
- Very limited declines compared to the rest of the crypto market 
- Reliance on constant recruitment of new investors and continued expansion into new markets (just look at the referral bonuses and all the different countries with offices)
- No whitepaper or any explanation of the code or concept 
- Vague references to bots, mining, minting, etc. to explain the ridiculously high returns
- No profiles for the team or anyone at the top that can be held accountable in any way
You might be able to make a lot of money before the house of cards comes crashing down but you should at least know what's happening here.

Ponzi scheme.  When the cards finally fall, I'd like you to post that...

Thanks for looking out for us sugar muffins!

That's just plain amazing.  I can't believe nobody has commented yet.

Probably not the best idea.  When Bitcoin moves, it moves big.  It just got out of a consolidation period and appears to be entering the parabolic portion of this uptrend.  If you look at it on a log scale, it hasn't even gone fully vertical and out of control yet.  It follows a relatively predictable trend and this is likely to be a big move up from here, probably to between $4,000 and $5,000.  It will dip though as usual so you could always buy back then.  Also, there are many other cryptos that look really great from a technical analysis standpoint.  You should go explore and have a party.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity where an entirely new asset class is being created and most people have no idea how to even buy in yet.  Once we have ETFs, funds, etc and people on CNBC are talking about cryptos, then you sell.  :-)

That is amazing.  I've just started reading more on it.  Thank you.

Oh haha just saw the license plate... very delayed.  My brain is all crypto'd out.  Awesome.
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:36:38
That's just an M3?  I can't fully tell.

Whale blubber oil salesman says solar panels are a fraudulent means of energy extraction...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:39:06
Loving the responsible paternalistic post! We need more of this.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:52:47
FUN!  I'm actually enjoying watching my portfolio die this badly.  I feel like I'm paying for future returns with these massive current losses.  ;-)

The communist Chinese government and Jamie Dimon plus his crony bank will both be dead and forgotten about before crypto even gets started!
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:39:52
JAMIE DIMON IS A FINANCIAL TERRORIST.

Coinbase definitely isn't sketchy.  It's pricey and it always crashes on very high volume days.  But it is very reputable and they certainly would like to maintain that reputation and grow.  Coinbase or Gemini are fine as fiat gateways and then Bittrex is the best crypto exchange IMO. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:25:13
That is beautiful.  I actually bought a mint condition 100 trillion Zimbabwe note thinking it might go up in value for the pure absurdity of it.  I guess we'll see!
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:35:16
Do not be scared.  Remain stoic and buy big dips when possible. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:39:26
This definitely requires elaboration...
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:45:07
BOOM!  As a half Finnish man, I love this!
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:46:33
The Finns are many many steps ahead of the communist Chinese scum!

Haha several hours have gone by and I JUST got this joke.

They may just use the blockchain for their own operations and it will just be the employees that are doomed, which is actually quite tragic but a natural result of progress.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:08:26
Beautifully done!
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:56:36
It'll be fine.  There are delays like this sometimes and today they had a notification on the website about it.  I am also waiting for a transaction and I've dealt with it before.  It should be processed tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:11:50
Same here.  I'm just hoping it goes up in value for the sheer novelty of it but there is the risk that the same or another government goes even crazier and beats it.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:00:33
Even a broken clock is right two times a day.  He literally says the same thing no matter what is happening:  dollar is gonna crash, interest rates are gonna skyrocket, hyperinflation, gold will go to $50,000, bubble, bubble, bubble.  And then he seemed intelligent the one time everything did actually implode.  He is from the Australian school of economic thought, which is a fairly respectable libertarian type of thought but they don't understand the monetary system in its current form.  Otherwise he would be scared of deflation not hyperinflation.  Anyway he will always say sell the dollar, buy gold, etc.  Don't listen to him.  He even called them "fiat cryptocurrencies" which clearly makes no sense.

Yea def Blockfolio.  They even just had and update that added a bunch of new tokens.  It's just plain wonderful!
