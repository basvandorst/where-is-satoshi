Well, if the only thing keeping it alive was the fact that there was no other site in Europe operating over several countries which allowed you to buy bitcoins using SEPA. Coibase is a larger company, which provides more services, has a larger userbase. So there's not much point in using bitstamp if Coibase operates in your country...

I honestly expected a more in depth analysis from a firm like Delloite. This "paper" is as informative as googling "what is bitcoin?" and hitting the _I'm feeling lucky_ button

I guess that would be a bigger issue for full reserve banks. For every person defaulting on his loan you'd use a significantly larger size of lendable capital. Also, the incentive of not defaulting lies on both parties,  the borrower -- since he still owes the money borrowed -- and the lender -- since even modern banks go bankrupt if too many people default on their loans.

I am buying bitcoins, and I also happen to spend them here and there (including reddit). What bothers me is that I could  for instance get enough bitcoins to buy a burger at  800€/BTC, and by the time I get to the shop I realise the BTC is down 30% and I've only got money left for some shitty fries and some dip. And that's the thing that makes me clench my sphincter whenever I order BTC on bitstamp, the idea that in a few mins they could be worth significantly less.

Well, technically he just spews out the type of bullshit that you can hear in any third rate conspiracy documentaries such as Zeitgeist or Money as Debt. Full-reserve banking is the type of fringe economical crap that only hardcore libertarian Austrian economists would push forward, and it's anything but the common sense solution it masks itself to be.

Fractional reserve banking does not require, afaik a central bank. 


No, the guy who was able to get the money to do the job he needed profited first. Please stop using the word bank like it's a curse word.


That Masonic-Bilderberg-Satanist-Jew Christine Lagarde and her mischiefs...


Trickle down economics has nothing to do with central banks, and you don't need to go past the first paragraph on the Wikipedia article to know this. Stop dropping random terms.


This is the type of cheap statement that not only makes you look like some fringe conspiracy theory nutcase, but is also offensive if you think about people that _live_ in actual tyranical states.

If you lower the reserve needed too much, yes, of course.  At full reserve however, in my view not only you take a significant risk at any investment (since the money you lose is money you won't be able to invest next time), but also you can't even finance the things that need financing at the time they need it, since you need to prioritize your work so much. 
Imagine a farming town that needs a grain silo and a few tractors. Both are urgent, and the one bank in town doesn't have the reserve to back both. One will get deprioritized, and even that one will lose value if the other is not financed, since an empty grain silo or rotting grains in the end help no one. Now granted, a more complex thought experiment where this would fail l even with a fractional reserve can be constructed, _but_ that's a discussion about what that fraction of the reserve should be pegged. Which is a way more complex topic of discussion.

Well, I disagree. IIRC when "disproving" fiat currencies it disregards completely the fact that the Great Depression took place when the states were using the gold standard, and  it puts forward ideas that are anything but the current consensus among modern economists. 
Just because something is packed and sold as a common sense solution does not make it one.

Can't say enough thanks for this video -- it's amazingly informative.

UKIP? And dissing fractional reserve banking? Really I was expecting more from you.

Why aren't Islamic banks the most efficient ones in the world, given that more or less they are full reserve ones?
Basically fractional reserving, while done responsibly allows the banker to give more loans to people with projects. Thus fewer important business projects are forced to wait for others to get completed, and your economic landscape suddenly becomes more dynamic and less forbidding to new entrants. TL;DR: you think it's hard raising money for a start-up in the current „reckless” economy? Try doing it in a full reserve banking system.
Disclaimer: I have no formal schooling in economic theory, so there may be other reasons for which the most competitive states in the world stick to the fractional reserve system.

I wasn't disputing the supremacy of BTC over gold, I was disputing the claims that a fractional reserve system and fiat currencies are evil by design

You do realise that it's people like me that spend their BTC that makes their value increase and thus help speculators like you?
