Have you ever heard of Mt. Gox? Ask the Russian whose behind bars about what a tainted coin is. You can mix them, and tumble but it doesn't remove the taint from a coin used in a crime. Honestly read into it man its fascinating.

Also the article says they might of accumulated 20,000 coins but they still have an uphill challenge of cashing out those coins. They are still tainted coins because of the crimes that may have been committed in accumulating them. They would still have to launder that through mules or alts would help. They would still lose a huge chunk of that money turning it into cash, and if they hodl with greater blockchain surveillance governments could blackball individuals or other govs in the future. Think of it as worse than a traditional bank ropper because now everyone knows who you are when you use/swap those coins they will be tied to some sucker in the end.
