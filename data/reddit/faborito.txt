No so much a question, not a pitch either, anyway...here it goes:
The company I work for does BIG systems. When I say BIG, I mean probably ten or 20 times MtGox. The technology that we have can handle scale like something you have never seen.
We have had clients running setups with 30 servers go down to &lt;10 using our tech.
I would like to talk to you to see if we can help you. Scaling is HARD and we've been doing it for years. And we want to see Bitcoin succeed. 
Personally, I'm a heavy Bitcoin user. I lost a lot of money yesterday. I want to see you succeed as well as other exchanges in order for the value to go up again.
Your scaling issues are probably going to get worse and throwing servers at the problem is not the answer.
Please let me know.

Venezuelan here:
Not sure where RealHuman gets its information but is near to Imposible right now to get dollars. 
The problem your friend has and is a problem that we all have is exactly that we are all in the same boat: there's no point in holding bolívares so why would one accept them for BTC? 
Buying dollars in Venezuela is against the law with jail time if they catch you. With Maduro losing his shit everyday, not everyone is willing to take the risk. And the fact that 1$=62 bolívares does not help

I understand what you are saying, but we are a serious company with a roster of pretty well established clients. We've been in business for more than 10 years and our reputation speaks for itself.
Btw, we don't do cheap :)
