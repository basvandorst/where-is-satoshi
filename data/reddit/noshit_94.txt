I didn't say it was mostly used to tax evasion, I that was an advantage of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:08:25
But one of the major advantages of Bitcoin is tax evasion/avoidance.

The problem with Greece is that the government spent a whole bunch of money that it didn't have and then it couldn't pay it back, the obvious solution would be to cut expenses, not plunder the population even more.
To put it simply, if Greece were a drug addict, cutting expenses would be staying in abstinence in order to cure the vice, raising taxes would be drugging yourself even more to prolong the high at the expense of a worse crisis later.

Regardless of the law, is there a way to buy Bitcoin anonymously to avoid taxes? I always thought that's was one of the major advantages of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:25:58


Yeah... Greece's situations isn't caused by tax evasion/avoidance.

Only if you're a retard that you'll put in saving in Bitcoin without knowing how it works just because people on the internet said so. That said, if you take it long term you'll see that Bitcoin value has been always rising, it's still a new technology that most people don't know how it works, and there's still a lot of people just using it for speculation. I doubt gold went from being just a pretty rock to money in only 5 or 10 years. Many people a still afraid of hackers and other schemes, as the Times passes if Bitcoin proves itself safe frauds and hacking, and taking into account the fiat money is inevitably going to crash, Bitcoin might be a viable substitute.
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:41:02
Well, I'd say you should diversify a little, doesn't necessarily need to be on fiat, maybe some stocks of a stable company or even gold stocks. You can make some profit and save for an emergency.

Can you give an exemple? (in a decent country of course)


They are, but as the private sector has already proven it's much more efficient than the government sector, is those services were provided privately the risks would be considerably higher.


Slavery naturally consolidated for all history, and yet it came to an end.
Also, what small piece? The state is by far the most powerful institution created by men.
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:07:54


That's exactly why bitcoin is so good, government can't cheat you with a hidden tax (inflation).
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:06:19


Like anybody else, without counterfeiting. So it's obvious that no country will ever adopt bitcoin as it's official currency.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:00:30
Well, the essence of socialism is state central planning of the economy, central banks do exactly that, so...
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:48:47
It's true though. That's what happened in Japan, people started hoarding cash in their homes.

Low interest is different from negative interest, which is nothing more than a fee, and most people try to find the lowest price to buy stuff.

So socialism and communism are essentially the same thing today? 
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:13:59


Robbing and kidnapping people are already a "profitable" idea, and still we don't have robbers perpetually raiding the people (aside from the government), and surely it isn't because of the half-assed job the police provides.
People are always inclined to invest more in protection than criminals to invest in aggression, and aggression is very expensive, for one you might die (a probability that would rise significantly with the end of gun control), also specially without things like drug prohibition, criminals would lose their (by far) most important income stream.

@_date: 2017-01-26 14:34:16
I disagree, If we had no government then people would defend themselves against proto-governments the same way they'd do from robbers, killers and other criminal entities.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:06:54


Most of the poverty in developed and okayish countries is do to government policies like minimum wage, welfare, protectionism, and regulations that make opening your own business much more expensive.
Also, the poor already pay for the police, it's called taxes.


The employer needs the employees as much as they need the employer, employees won't work to a employer known for not paying the salaries owed.
Also an unregulated market would have much more companies competing for employees, thus rising their bargain power.


So they'll exterminate human population? And what the fuck would they do with their money if there's no one else to produce goods?


Exactly, companies combined with a state is like a person with a nuke, take the nuke away and the person can't do much harm. 
If only the bad people are willing to buy off politicians, then only them will thrive in a regulated market. While the honest entrepreneurs will be regulated out of business.


Exactly, war is only profitable when you have this money printing institution to socialize the costs while concentrating the profits, again, take the state away and they no longer have that option. Would the war lobbyists be willing to make a war when they are the ones bearing its whole cost? I doubt it.

It's not a hope, during most of US's history it was charity that helped poor, the "robber barons" that everyone loves to hate did fantastic philanthropy, churches had places for the homeless to stay and so on. And as charity wasn't a "right", people would work to improve and get on their feet, instead of eternally sucking welfare benefits.
Welfare not only take people's money, it takes their sense of duty to help his fallow men, after all government is already doing it with my money, so why should I donate?
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:44:15
It's the same argument. You can't say government owns everything, including the people (slavery sends their regards), without assuming the government is legitimate in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:03:40


@_date: 2017-01-04 17:47:36
Well, you're sending them worthless paper and they're sending valuable stuff in return. Looks like a pretty good deal to me.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:03:02


@_date: 2017-01-26 20:11:07


Previously when? Governments only can get away with it because a large part of the population see them as legitimate. Which isn't the case for private companies.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:21:33
Huh, I always thought that socialism was the transitional central planning government that would later lead to communism where all workers would own everything and there'd be no private property.
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:02:26
That not an endemic problem and would be vastly reduced with no gun control and a more efficient (private) police.


What if the government decides that, who will save you? No company has anything near as powerful as states' military.


The largest military force in history, of course.


The same reason why food producers don't buy hospitals and then poison their food to enhance their profit on the health sector. In a competing market if one company no longer satisfies it's clients, then they'll go to another company.


Care to elaborate?


No other fish has such a discrepancy in power as the state has in relation to the people. 
Moreover, the american invasion on Iraq cost like $300 million dollars per day (and Iraq is a shithole, imagine if they were rich and the citizens had access to military grade weapons), do you think a company that doesn't have the power to print money could handle this cost? And still be profitable?

According to economic historian Price V. Fishback that wasn't really the case:
"[Since it was founded in 1890, the United Mine Workers (UMW) labor union has played a key role in United States coal mining. Strikes were very common, the rhetoric employed about exploitation was effective in mobilizing strikers. Detailed analysis of historical data by Fishback (1992) shows that mining wages were as high, if not higher, than those in manufacturing industry; that the prices in company stores were rarely higher than those in independent stores; and that miners who were dissatisfied with working conditions in a particular mining camp could either "vote with their feet" by migrating elsewhere or use the "voice" of collective union action to resist the threatened abuse.](
Historian Linda Carlson argues that the managers of corporate towns in the early 20th century believed they could avoid the mistakes made by George Pullman in the 1880s. She says they:
"[wanted to create a better life for their employees: decent housing, good schools, and a "morally uplifting" society. In return, they expected stable, hard-working employees who would eschew the evils of drink and, most important, not fall prey to the blandishments of union organizers.](
"[During the late nineteenth century, model company towns materialized, as enlightened industrialists recognized that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions. These industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working class districts in order to create better living conditions for workers. Model company towns such as Port Sunlight (1888) and Bournville (1895) were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation. The ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the Garden City movement.
The model company town is concerned with creating a productive and prosperous company. Enlightened industrialists believed this could be achieved by providing a healthier residential environment for their employees.](


Private companies built the *whole* city from scratch in an previously unowned land, and most importantly, they built it with their own money. The government on the other hand uses your stolen money to build their often overpriced infrastructure on already existing cities.

Clearly not 100% if at least I, for one, never agreed to it. Still haven't answered, what give a the government the right to tax me in the first place?
Government will invade my property and kidnap me if I don't pay taxes, so yes, the analogy is valid.

Or maybe they could hire competing private companies to protect them as described by David Friedman in "[Machinery of freedom](
But I agree that people would have a much stronger relation with their neighbors and would also have a higher incentive to voluntarily help each other.
Also, I really don't see why anyone would elect a general instead of hiring one as a service provider.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:40:49
That's circular reasoning. It assumes the government has the right to tax in order to prove the government has the right to tax.

Yes, so? The companies built the towns from scratch (and thus owned it), and nobody was forced to work for them nor to live there. The government on the other hand builds nothing, just imposes it's will on other people's properties by threat of violence and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:11:22
You mean your unfounded conclusions? Based on fantastic arguments like:
