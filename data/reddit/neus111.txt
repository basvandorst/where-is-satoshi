Convicted Felon Roger Vers everyone. Take a bow.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:38:46
Oh no it's retarded
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:47:02
That thing happen everytime, the price should return stable

So what you are saying is that I should buy 1,000 coins of each sub $.01 currency that I come across and in 8 years time I will have $25 million dollars and a Lambo at least?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:34:12
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:50:32
Yeah, well...so I thought this is a bargain and went to coinbase as it's my only account where I can quickly ( &lt; 3 days) buy BTC via credit card. +$20 fees for buying and to send it to my wallet another $20...wow.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:59
I used to hodl. I still do, but i used to too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:55
For daytrade is better if you keep your coin in exchanger

Why would mama’s new couch be in the basement and not the living room?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:43:45
Hold them until the waters calm down, and we'll finally send and receiver BTC without extremely high fees!

Everyone knows he's not. The title graphic was to troll him I suspect. And even if it wasn't, that was the result.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:36:16
I wonder how mexican bitcoin exchange people are kept safe, maybe the dumb criminals here haven't got the news.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:08:05
Hahhaha, the best explanation for this coin
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:06:45
The same people running the nodes are also the only people hashing it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:33:59


What do you think about ledger nano s?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:00:42
Yes, are the same
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:26:28
Finally! The dip I was waiting for!
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:41:16
I put it in the strongbox
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:20:06
It's p2p and everyone can open a hub.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:42:08
We have basically zero storefronts (brick and mortar or online) that take bitcoin. Use it... how?
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:47:08
Add a supertanker labeled VISA next to the BTC truck and you'll see why this analogy is dumb
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:36:36
If you get your bitcoin news from MSN, I think it's safe to say you have no idea what the hell you're talking about
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:55:21
This is why charlie lees coin is the future
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:05:34
Not a true HODL. You sold for brain surgery. You SODL!
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:37:27
Peronally I think Ledger is more easily and more secure.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:41:46
This is cult like talk
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:49:16
For bitcoin the best online wallet is this: 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:20:32
Litecoin, Dash. Now, goodbye and wait for LN, a LONG TERM solution.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:02
Now's a good time to dump your bcash Mr. Nakamoto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:27
"But I won't be able to afford my Christmas presents! sell sell sell!"
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:44:02
You aren't happy??
The christmas sales are avaiable also for crypto!
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:02:44
Does the core wallet even support segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:49:39
I’m not talking about the counterparty risk that exists in the contract for the sale of goods. I’m talking about the counterparty risk that exists in the contract for banking and payment services. In those, your bank/payment processor can refuse to pay balances shown/owed/disputed. This is usually done under “equitable” concerns (i.e., “We don’t think it’s fair that you have your money.”).
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:44
yes, what are some alternate sources to discuss?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:21
It hit 5550 on gemini during that period. Bought that dip at the very bottom
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:58:14
No one is panicking except the shills;P
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:37:08
I am very excited to see what will happen in 2018 that will change peoples perpective.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:56:48
If we don't get the fee situation under control we risk losing bitcoin to the shitty bcash devs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:02:54
Yes, the best and more secure way to store your coins...
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:20:51
Looks like she is doing the exact opposite of loss prevention.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:23
Did the same thing!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:53:14

@_date: 2017-12-23 10:02:46
You get a rare upvote from me today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:03:57
What makes you think this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:16:09
Is better, maybe try to use Exodus deposit some coin and make the backup
