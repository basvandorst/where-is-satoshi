You are repeating an ignorant point of view that shows you are not familiar with Ulbricht's trial and the evidence presented there as well as the timeline of events and how exactly those corrupt officers were and were not involved.

It is real and I too am still in disbelief.

I just signed up on multiple exchanges and kept maxing them out as they slowly raised my limit.  Now I just use Coinbase because I have a huge limit.

It would be irresponsible to sell a token that does not exist and may never exist.  This is why we need true prediction markets and why millions have been invested in their development.

Do you think creating a paypal account is hard?  Because you really don't need to know anything about bitcoin in order to sign up on an exchange and start using bitcoin.

Probably an exchange.  It is fairly new address and the most it has ever had in it at one time is &lt;570 BTC

Don't mind me, I'm just here to tag along your inaccurate headline to remind people that Ross Ulbricht is a scumbag.  Whether it is inaccurate on purpose, I don't care enough to find out.

I trust in scientific process above all.  Just because something has been historically accepted as the best option does not make it the best option.  Especially within the framework of a system that is been untested outside of its rigid framework like the Fed.
  
Continue with your methodology and I can assure you that barring blind luck, you will not be at the forefront of innovation.

That is not true.  We want the audit expanded because it excludes activities of the fed.

I can't tell if you are just an ignorant twat or an actual liar.  Either way you are wrong.  I felt bad for you for a second but it passed pretty quick.
  
If you are American go try it for yourself.

His logic is flawed because he doesn't mention that there are activities of the federal reserve that congress doesn't get to know anything about because they are excluded from the audit.  We just want the audit expanded and reported to the proper authority which is our congress.

GDAX is an actual exchange where traders trade Bitcoin and other crypto currencies against each other and the USD.  Coinbase was their first offering before they built GDAX and is advertised as a Bitcoin wallet.  It doesn't have the trading features that GDAX has.  You can easily transfer your crypto between Coinbase and GDAX to take advantage of the trading features.

Your opinion piece is noted.  I'll stick to the fact that my elected officials do not have a full picture of the federal reserve.  They should not have to operate blind and make trade-offs.  Congress cannot arrive at the best decisions without all of the information.  The current system is an excuse and I am sick of excuses.
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:47:07
Bitcoin gives power to the people while the Federal Reserve takes power from the people by inflating your money and reducing its spending power over time.  The person speaking is the Chairman of the federal reserve who was testifying in front of a congressional committee and this was on national TV.  On top of that, the sign was held up while she was dodging a question about why she didn't want to be audited so the timing was perfect.

Your link doesn't work.  Try? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:09:35
It's not much different than the oppositions fear and we shouldn't base policy on it.  We should recognize the fact that congress makes decisions based on incomplete data and center around this.

It is just like them to completely ignore a grass roots movement.  Bitcoin acceptance is definitely up among small business owners.  I've seen bitcoin accepted stickers on businesses popping up in the last year all over san francisco.

The discussion was about the barrier to entry in obtaining and using bitcoin and not your feelings on the best way to secure your coins.

Now who needs some education.  I am pointing out that it is an incomplete picture like our current audit.
  
Can you give me a reason that does not distill down to fear for not doing a complete audit and reporting it to congress?

I'm not sure about videos, that is a good question.  Here is their page on fees

Since you are going with the cash deposit route, you might as well move it to GDAX and buy from there when you are ready.  If you structure your order correctly you will pay nothing in fees.  You have some time to learn about that.

If you trolled the fuck out of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on national TV while they were trying to dodge a question about why they don't want to be audited then yes, you could make thousands as you have seen here.

The current audit is not a full audit and leaves congress in the dark on aspects of the federal reserve and how they operate.  As a result they cannot make decisions based on all of the information because it is excluded from them.  The lack of transparency creates a flawed system where corrupt people can make decisions without accountability. 
  
All of the arguments against a full audit are based on fear mongering and not scientific proof like they should be.  This is why you will see people say that a full audit would give congress too much control as a fear mongering tactic when it doesn't actually give them any more control than they do now.  It would just make them more informed and empower congress to make better decisions.

Currently the GAO is prohibited by law from auditing four areas of the Federal Reserve:
  
Transactions for or with a foreign central bank, government of a foreign country, or no private international financing organization;
       
Deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters, including discount window operations, reserves of member banks, securities credit, interest on deposits, and open market operations;
      
Transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or
       
a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to clauses (1)–(3) of this subsection.
