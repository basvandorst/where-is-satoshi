I did exactly this at $8015 a few days ago. Ten minutes later the price jumped to $8200. 2 BTC no less. Hold me.

Sold 2 BTC at $8000, bought again at $13400. Am I doing it right?

This is the good shit, bless your heart
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:20:00
Most certainly.

Yup, tried to short it and got burnt. Welp. I'll buy them back if the price falls below $8015.

Whoops, just sold 2 BTC at $8015 to make a quick buck. I may be very stupid. Will never try that again.

The plan was never to get out, just to sell high and buy it back a bit lower. I failed miserably though, so I hope you're right lol

As a crypto noob this is my first dip. Give me some encouraging words please

From another comment I made:


Because I am not the sharpest tool in the shed apparently.

Awesome, thanks for being smarter than me :^)

Good point. I'm going to let it sit for a couple of years either way, so perhaps it won't make too much of a difference in the end.

Son, I wasn't done buying Bitcoin :^(
@_date: 2019-04-06 14:10:20
I wasn't done buying Bitcoin to hodl when the price flew up. Should I waste my tax returns on Bitcoin at this price?
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:18:08
Dang, I wasn't done buying. Receiving my tax returns tomorrow.
