Come on. Bounce back to what? Forbes apparently does not know what price discovery is.

Ripple is just legacy banking 2.0 and nothing more. Fuck Ripple. It isn't a currency I don't understand why it is still on Coinmarketcap

As I keep saying, registered MSBs such as Coinbase HAVE TO report anything and everything even remotely suspicious to FinCEN, and are also subject to SEC regulations. If they do not they cannot operate in the US, it is that simple. 
If you want to bitch about Coinbase, take it up the latter to the organizations making it that way. 
Use CB to buy Bitcoin, transfer it to your own wallet, and spend it from there if that is your intent. Don't use CB as your wallet.

Software RAID5 yes, proper hardware RAID not so much, but then you are getting into enterprise tech at that point. 
But RAID is applied by what your goals are exactly, usually when picking RAID5 you are looking for redundancy and decent performance with minimized cost, not raw speed.

Get ready for machines that can do business with eachother without us

Well that is funny, it kind of seems like USD, Euro, etc, are all failing as currencies too...
Bitcoin however is not a currency, or a stock, or other asset. It is a truly new breed of commerce.

Keynsian dogma is preached throughout banking worldwide now. Every system is based upon those principals in the modern world, and hence all have the same flaw.
They demand infinite credit growth in a world of finite resources, which is simply impossible. The debt curve eventually becomes parabolic, and soon after its cyanora for the currency after a fatal collapse. People act like this has never happened before, but in fact has several times because fiat currency is a lie. 
The unprepared for what happens next face a grim future indeed.

It is a registered MSB in the US, of course if fucking acts like a bank. Why is anyone surprised with this?
If you want to bitch about it take it up with FinCEN and the SEC who make them act like one.

This isn't really the same thing.
With Bitcoin doing a hard fork is to make a core change to the protocol, where Elacoin was basically risen from the dead in name only with an entirely differant algorithm (PoS instead of PoW). They should have just launched a fresh project. 
Bitcoin would not be doing anything as extreme as entirely changing the mining protocol, were just changing the block size.
Plus Cryptsy sucks ass.

The problem isn't integrations. The problem is most people don't have Bitcoin, and won't go out of their way to get it just to tip someone on Soundcloud.
We need employers who pay people in Bitcoin to close the economic loop.

I think we are reaching Bitcoin's real price in terms of mining them raw, as miners are top sellers to keep their farms running.
People forget the last bubble was entirely Mt. Gox shenanigans and not real. All of that liquidity was fake as Mt. Gox actually had no Bitcoin at the time, just their "bitcoin" that people were trading with in a closed space as fiat was not moving out of it either. Add early media driven speculative hype and naturally things spiked hard on the largest exchange, which was Gox at the time. 
Today we have many more exchanges, much more diverse liquidity, and less single points of bullshit like Gox to deal with. Price discovery is allowed to happen naturally now. 
Past indicators are NOT the future kids, Bitcoin is a different animal than it was a year ago. If you are speculating from the last bubble then you are basing your assumptions on a false price and baseless liquidity (and just low liquidity compared to now). If you erased Gox from the picture, it would have been a steadier climb up to these levels than a perceived "downturn" to them which it isn't really when you look at all the pieces.

Wha? Pretty sure human slavery is not only a thing but a booming industry with sex trafficing and whatnot. Last I read it was estimated that at least several million unfortunate souls are trafficked each year.

Cant believe someone gilded this tripe.
Coinbase is a licensed and vetted financial services company, what do you all expect? 
They are running a business not a fucking charity, and there are others to choose if you don't like them (who have to comply with the SAME SHIT from the SEC and FinCEN if they want to operate in US jurisdictions).
Coinbase first and formost is an exchange with a wallet service ( you should never use)

It's almost as if people are losing faith in their bullshit fiat currencies controlled by monopolistic financial fascist oligarchs or something...

I think overall its banks in general that want a cashless society, however one they still control completely.

This is just because the real "fix" for this issue isn't widely adopted.
It is just the remains of engineers making a prototype application without worrying too much about the minutia.
We just need to standardize how Bitcoin is displayed to real people. No one should be expected to just know that "1 Bitcoin" is in fact 100,000,000 smaller units, which is also a very large number. Underneath it can stay the same because computers dont care. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:06:56
Anyone saying "it will raise the price" is MISSING THE FUCKING POINT.
Bitcoin, and blockchains at large, are REPLACEMENTS for fiat currency and the way we do business with eachother in general. 
By the time Bitcoin is hitting prime time there will be no "price", only what a Bitcoin can buy.

Charlie Songhurst doesn't seem to get that fiat and Bitcoin are exactly nothing alike. Bitcoin is not even really a currency but a whole other financial animal entirely.
He's wrong.
There will just be Bitcoin and a bunch of Bitcoin driven apps and service blockchains layered on top of it.
Bitcoin is a transaction protocol, fiat is not. Eventually you won't even know you're using Bitcoin any more than you are using TCP/IP right now to browse Reddit.
