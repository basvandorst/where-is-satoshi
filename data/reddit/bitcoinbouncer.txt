Just over 10Gh/s but he paid over 72BTC, at least, for the pleasure, LOL.

He didn't. Trust me. He's a scammer. Plain and simple. He articulates very well. You're probably his schill account. :)

Have a read of the bitcointalk thread? I'm sure you've read the ED Article?

You need to realise that bitcoin is a community built on the association of trust with other members, not to say naivety and foolishness should reign supreme of course, but most people buying paper wallets aren't buying them from eBay.
Find a trusted merchant, have a look on Bitcoin OTC or bitcointalk forum etc.
Spend time and choose wisely. Just because someone COULD get your private key does not mean they will.
If you want to try and ensure additional safety ask the merchant to give you a split key and apply XOR.
Good Luck in the quest for the secure paper wallet :)

 is a sufficient method of trading - and yes up to $100K is possible with certain traders on there. Cash, generally.
You need to be very careful - as I am sure many others have mentioned - before buying any amount of BTC.
OTC uses a WoT system which should help you decide who you deal with. This is available in the OTC channel using a bot called "gribble"
I would attempt to make some trades in here - there are a multitude of high value traders who can facilitate your request. It's again even easier to spread it among several of them. I would suggest you be prepared to do cash deposit at any major US bank or cash in mail or cash on meet face-to-face.
I would strongly suggest that if you go the way of Exchange do not just click BUY $100K as you will heavily influence the price and result in a negative-buy for yourself. You'll drive the price up unnecessarily.
Trade safely!
