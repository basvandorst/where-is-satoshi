What backs up bitcoins? I can't convert them to the processing power that went into them, and they don't have anybody with an army and tax revenues guaranteeing their value.
 I don't really get it.

I thought it was for trying to hire a hitman?

Saying that banks caused the great depression  is, (if we're being  charitable) a gross oversimplification, and defining the term 'nerd' so narrowly that it includes computer engineers but not economists seems arbitrary.

That's dumb.

Hand waving isn't a good answer.  you sound like someone from the petroleum industry.
Again, what's the consensus on how we decrease the energy requirements for this tech?
Or at least mitigate the effects of it's waste production?
Also, you really think people are conspiring to slow adoption? Seems like Crypto is doing pretty well. Makes it easier to move capital around without gov't oversight, so you *definitely* have the elites on board. Seems like it's just another form of currency, like paper or gold, but with some major teething issues that need to be overcome.
Being dismissive about the negative externalities, though? Pretending that the laws of physics are going to be suspended in this one special case, just because you feel so strongly about it? That's how you turn people against the tech and slow adoption.
I dunno, man. My 2 cents.

Hey, so what's the consensus on how we decrease the energy requirements for the tech?
You can shit on this paper, but the issue it raises has be addressed - esp. if the blockchain is as important a technology as many assume.

OK cool, you don't like to use crypto as shorthand for cryptocurrency. Duly noted. good for you.
I'll ask again, isn't ***Cryptocurrency*** ultimately just another form of, well, currency?

So then, you're super on board with speeding adoption of renewables, right? Because if we're increasing overall energy consumption by even a couple of extra pps at a time when we really really need to be decreasing consumption, and we're using non-renewables, that's a big deal.

isn't crypto just another form of money?

During the crisis, the survival of the economy will be riding on the next Lehman's being bailed out by the gov't.
 OTOH, ultimately, the only things riding on the value of bitcoin are the collective savings of a subculture of hobbyists, and the incomes of some drug dealers and scammers.

What, like nanotech? What do you mean?

If you have enough people, they're going to form networks of economic connections, and if  anything more complicated than barter transactions are involved, those networks are probably going to end up having some form of regulation, and somebody to enforce it, whether you want to call that a 'state' or not.
I have a hard time taking people who throw around 'statist' as an invective very seriously.

that's fair, I get the distinction, but I feel like I'm still getting the idea across, even without the modifiers.

I mean, maybe it's a new form of currency, but it's certainly not a replacement for most government functions.
