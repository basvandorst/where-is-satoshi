Wow - amazing how nobody in that thread seems to have any ethical issues with the professional troll there, &amp; lots of people actually asking how to sign up! wtf 
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:58:34
Lol - does this sub really believe bitcoin is the only viable blockchain in this space?? Get your heads out of your asses
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:11:40
Lol what media outlet is going to hype the bitcoin halving?? Nobody outside of these sub gives a shit

You're getting downvoted b/c its probably a silly question with an unrelated answer &amp;you solved it yourself. They wouldn't gain anything. This is most likely someone outside of Coinbase placing curious orders on the market.

@_date: 2014-10-26 06:23:29
So Bitcoin needs to grow its user base in order to ever be a successful invention - its design actually mandates that it have easy &amp; usable applications
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:05:54
One of the first things I've used my bitcoin for! So cool to pay with my phone and see it instantly verified on the site. Anyways, if you haven't had the chance to read Lessig's book, *Republic Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress*, I highly recommend [getting a copy]( I'd consider it one of the most important political books I've ever read. Quick read too!

no you're right - i'm just in the jaded phase of bitcoin right now 
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:40:55
Why would a 5btc transaction be more kilobytes? Also I paid more than the actual tx fee and got zero confirmations. I had to completely redo my order the next day with a 0.01 transaction fee and it still took about 20minutes to get confirmed. Sorry bitcoin sucks right now
@_date: 2014-10-10 14:21:33
100% agree - the movie just very briefly summarized all the shit most of us already know. I guess if you were new though it could be interesting. I did love seeing those tradehill idiots decide that the best way to legitimize their business was to pay $30k/mo in rent haha - tradehill who? And also so glad they were able to find a none stereotypical black guy to put in the movie  lol

Your completely wrong actually. What you heard was that there were 2 customers who never got the bitcoins they should have for their deposits. Investors are still completely fucked
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:34:50
I wonder if Neo &amp; Bee is behind this? Their grand opening is in a couple days and their initial prospectus said they would be adding a substantial amount of liquidity to the market at the end of the month if I remember right

You can invest in Neo &amp; Bee on Havelock too! I'm very excited to be a shareholder 
@_date: 2014-05-16 04:09:10
Let's hope they have massive reserves. This was precisely Neo &amp; Bee's idea. Great until the price plummets &amp; you don't have near enough bitcoins to cover your loses. Killed Neo in less than a month ( as well is my Bitcoin net worth - I can't stop crying)

@_date: 2014-01-06 21:57:03
What can be done about this? I'm a long time supporter of Bitcoin and this is one of the first things to have me worried about the currency. Can something be fixed in the protocol? This community needs to get passionate about finding a solution otherwise another cryptocurrency will..

@_date: 2014-05-05 02:39:15
correct - bitcoin is not a monolith you fucking genius
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:49:20
No - if it falls Neo is eating the loss. They've explained this in the prospectus. That's the primary reason for the stock offering - to have enough capital on hand to pay those losses back if needed.
EDIT: As Danny explains below they obviously will only allow for what could be covered by their capital. There's certainly some risk to this - If bitcoin fails Neo will lose much of the capital they raised. BUT I don't think that's a very likely scenario to be honest

Fuck! What the hell happened? This is a giant let down man
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:57:36
I'm assuming the ad campaign is about building momentum and educating about their services... 
A bitcoin bank is a COMPLETELY new thing - which is scary enough as it is with all the misinformation out there about bitcoin, throw in the fact that these people got completely burned by their banks not too long ago and you've got a huge uphill battle to fight in gaining consumer trust.
Neo is doing it exactly right. They are going to be around for the long haul. They SHOULD be taking the time to pique the public's interest and educate on bitcoin. 
The only people who really think this is a bad idea are the handful of their shareholders who expected their stock to skyrocket instantly - so annoying. "Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet."

If anyone knows how to do this let me know!
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:08:51
We'll see! Why do you have to shit on this already? If it doesn't work, we're back to where we are now, but if it does it's a massive step forward for this country. It sounds like you'd rather not even try?? It's not like this effort is being funded by tax dollars or anything.

Jesus Christ dude - regardless of your potential valid point some girl is dying and your telling them to "fuck off" - really man??? Get a fucking grip. 
AND BTW you idiot Bitcoin makes micro-transactions &amp; thus crowdsourcing much easier than ever before possible - its a fantastic vehicle for charity. The Bitcoin economy does not need to behave exactly like the fiat economy - thank god
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:47:17
I hope this post gets a lot of traction. This is a big issue. Your concerns and issues are spot on and I've experienced similar annoyances. I *was* excited about Bitcoin primarily because I thought it would make micro-transactions not only a possibility, but also super easy. It appears that this is not yet the case at all. I even recently tried to send a large transaction, 5btc, with a .0005 transaction fee attached and it got ZERO F-ing confirmations for over 24hours, **Huge bummer**, and further evidence that Bitcoin is still extremely overvalued at current prices.

We have to make this happen. I don't know of anyone else that is such a great advocate/educator/believer of bitcoin and the good it can do for the world. This is the type of person we need in the Bitcoin Foundation. WHy the fuck is that Ripple shill still there!?!?
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:41:08
I wonder why he even mentions bitcoin in this article? Is it because he's so butthurt about a decentralized currency that no gov controls that he just can't help himself?? OR is he banking that the mere mention of bitcoin will drive this sub to his article &amp; get him the page views his publisher wants to see...

@_date: 2014-07-17 18:41:12
Really?? What the fuck were you expecting? These are basic regs for any financial services company operating in the US - why would bitcoin companies get any sort of special treatment? Most of these are completely reasonable? Ex. Did you really want to see fractional reserve in bitcoin??
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:32:43
I hope this post gets a lot of traction because this is an extremely valid concern with no real solution yet. Most the people here will convince themselves that's not the case - b/c Bitcoin is flawless!! BUT its exactly that kind of thinking that will keep this tech from really going anywhere. People are concerned about privacy - and if they're not they should be. I sure as hell don't want to broadcast what I'm worth to the public so that criminals and greedy parasite businesses can try to take advantage.
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:58:25
Ridiculous that you're getting down voted for illustrating a very real, however unlikely or likely, scenario. This community is so afraid of talking about how huge of a problem this is. I've been involved in Bitcoin for 4yrs now &amp; this is the first time I've ever had concerns about its resilience as a currency. If we don't figure out how to stop pooled mining this could be the beginning of the end :(

That's a great story and all, but I fail to see how it relates to this... So back to the discussion, we both know that money in congress is a fucking cancer. You know what 'm gonna steal your metaphor actually.So congress has cancer right? -You know how people are treated for cancer when all else has failed? With fucking awful poison chemotherapy. This SuperPAC is essentially chemo. Our Doc, Lawrence, has been trying to beat this cancer for years and basically gotten nowhere. So this is yet another attempt. Will it work? I'm no pie in the sky dude either, but the shit is getting out of control. I am not willing to let the cancer just win. Yea chemo is poison, but it works sometimes too. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:57:31

Their tone has been pretty consistent  actually - a few years ago the New Yorker had a fantastic article on Bitcoin. They were one if the first major publications to not only write about it, but do it very well. That was my goto article when I was trying to convince my buddies that this wasn't a ponzi scheme. If I can find it again I'll give the link
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:50:05

I'd been buying Bitcoin every paycheck  since 2010. Somehow I was naive enough to "invest" all of that in Neo &amp; Bee. Oops! At least I probably have his daughters college education taken care of for him 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:00:59
Why is this a problem? Those were two incredibly important issues that happened to pop up on the same day. I'm glad they got so much coverage. One thread for either of these would not have had the same impact. 
Plus - Really?? Your fucking reddit page wasn't diverse enough for 1 whole day?? whaaaa ;_;
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:26:57
Soooo - If I were Danny Brewster I'd get people to donate to this,not really educate the population on wtf bitcoin is, &amp; then be "forced" to hold the btc until they're redeemed....
@_date: 2014-04-15 17:28:37

@_date: 2014-05-13 05:00:25
I'm sure these ladies don't view it as selling their dignity. Get a grip dude - the real reason your pissed is b/c they aren't fitting into this preconceived fantasyland notion you've constructed about women. How dare they not live up to your dumbass naivety!! So let's get back to reality OK? Fact: we are stuck in the world of capitalism &amp; so you sell your assets. These two have great bodies - that's their asset, deal with it. Some people have great ideas, or great brains, or great people skills, etc., etc. &amp;guess what? Its for sale too dude! Can you imagine!? I guess we're all "whores" selling whatever we have to get by. So fuck off - I dont see anyone being hurt here except for you for some reason

the answer to your question is no
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:06:58
Seems like kids under 18 could be a huge market for bitcoin as they do not have access to credit cards?
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:20:14
Just stop 
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:53:00
OP'S title is misleading. Vox regreted allowing their reporter to purchase bitcoins as it could be seen as unethical and could lead to potential bias. They're concerned about journalistic standards NOT the fact that their coverage was "pro" bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:18:23
Well dude I'm glad you got the chance to feel better than someone else today! Sorry life has beaten you up so much ;)

@_date: 2014-02-27 00:41:16
The timing could not be better. Neo is the antithesis of Gox and is just who we needed to take bitcoin to the next level. Amateur hour is over! So excited about 2014!

Its because that album fucking rules! Not because of Bitcoin - please
@_date: 2015-05-09 05:32:44
Such a rabbit hole to think about his intentions with this tweet. Seems like he wants to show he invented bitcoin. If he really is Satoshi is he actually thinking about coming public?? If so I want to know why the fuck he won't spend the goddamn bitcoin he's sitting  on to help spur this economy before it fades away
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:29:04
lol - was the fucking blog post necessary?? OP's title sums up everything I just wasted my time reading
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:40:10
Upvoted - atleast you're throwing out other ideas. Exiting may in fact turn out to be the best solution, but not until we try everything else. This is worth trying. I don't think we should give up so quick
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:04:40
No way - its different this time dude. Bitcoin would die. GAME OVER!!!  /s
@_date: 2014-06-29 04:50:48
holy shit this is fantastic! 
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:38:17
My point is we're all "whores". I'm sure you're selling some part of yourself to make money just like everyone else. If not you are very lucky. As long is nobody is getting hurt or taken advantage of then what's the difference man. I agree with you main point though: Nice bodies &amp; athletic prowess have very fucking little to do with Bitcoin this type of sponsorship is idiotic. I would much rather have seen money go towards sponsoring a math competition or scholarships or hackathons - something related &amp; worthwhile godamnit! I swear if the bitcoin "community" is gonna keep trying to out-stupid dogecoin then im gonna lose my shit. Now go be a Muslim and denounce the flesh! &amp;go fuck yourself ;)
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:14:35
You're feeding it..
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:51:53
Yea it is - the market cap is still very tiny. Until adoption picks up and more people own Bitcoin it's still easy to manipulate 
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:48:44
Yes!! Well I'm 100% confident this isn't a scam now. Danny just posted on bitcointalk that a full update will be coming out today too. You should xpost to @_date: 2014-04-11 19:09:23
FYI the "/s" at the end of my comment indicates sarcasm
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:40:19
He's a fantastic educator on bitcoin which is EXACTLY what this currency needs right now, so yea
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:58:38
Your confusing YOUR ideals for theirs. The two obviously aren't the same. They've got great bodies. &amp; that guy is good at punching shit. Yea neither is really making the world a better place but that's what these people have to offer that this society is willing to buy. Don't be mad at them. You should be mad that you can't make money for being a good person or being kind or some shit. THATS what's fucked up 
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:59:06

@_date: 2014-08-29 16:05:34
Seems like an awesome idea &amp; I really hope this succeeds! 
Sooooo many unanswered questions:
-what are the logistics here? How do you get 70,000 people a bitcoin wallet?
-do the bitcoins need to be redeemed? what happens if they're not?
-how is this funded? If primarily donations then what % is going towards the "drop"? How transparent will it be?
-what will the bitcoin education efforts entail? 
I've been burned by awesome sounding bitcoin ideas before: so If I were Danny Brewster I'd get people to donate to this,not really educate the population on wtf bitcoin is, &amp; then be "forced" to hold the btc until they're redeemed...

Just because they haven't moved yet, doesn't mean it will never happen. For a "trustless" currency aren't you putting a shitload of trust in one person/entity?? I think you'd agree that the market would go absolutely apeshit if those coins just simply moved to another address and that was it. BUt what if they were sold?? Or even worse, what if Satoshi had his own for-profit bitcoin company and used those coins to buy out all the competition. I mean there are a ton of scenarios like that and for bitcoin to really work we have to trust that Satoshi will do the economy no harm. With something as important as a global currency the size of Satoshi's wallet is a HUUUUGE problem
@_date: 2015-05-16 00:01:30
Yea it does - he likely owns over 1 MILLION fucking bitcoins. It's a huge issue. The dude could basically control the entire economy if he wanted. FUCK THAT. Myself and many others will never trust an economy where one person has that much power. Satoshi may have invented bitcoin, but he/she/they are the  reason it'll never go mainstream IMO
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:32:15
You're right-ish, bitcoin isn't flawed though, it's just getting adopted by merchants more quickly than consumers (which is to be expected). This is just how economics plays out in the real world. In the short term this will create more selling pressure as most of these business will convert to fiat, but looking out a bit further, in the mid-term as more people see that business will accept bitcoin then consumer adoption will rise and eventually we'll get a good balance and the selling pressure will be negligible. In the long-term business will see that its to their advantage to just keep their bitcoin since its accepted all over the place -and now we have more buying pressure, to the moon!! ;)

I agree - the psychological effects would definitely have to be considered. I think your idea of a clear plan of action would be crucial. My own personal opinion is that having Satoshi sitting on such a huge amount of bitcoin has only hurt our new economy. I think it's the major reason a lot of outsiders consider bitcoin a scam / ponzi scheme. Nobody wants to see 1 person have that much power. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:34:14

@_date: 2015-01-30 15:19:22
Did you talk to all the poor people or something? Do you not think there's poor people out there who are astute enough to understand the risk/reward and act accordingly? Personally speaking a portion of my savings is held in bitcoin b/c I understand the potential benefits of a highly volatile asset. A great feature of bitcoin is I can purchase a very tiny amount due to its divisibility &amp; fortunately I have access to a bank &amp; companies like Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:32:24
It's actually a good read. Is your point that regardless of where the price goes the movement (or lack of) will be momentous for the bitcoin economy? 
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:30:55
Hey bud you don't know my situation, but yea there are definitely people worse off - I don't think this a discussion regarding levels of poverty though.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:56:07
And hey man I am sorry if I offended you, I wasn't trying to paint poverty with broad strokes or claim that my situation is just like everyone elses b/c that is obviously never the case. I work full-time for a nonprofit devoted to these types of issues &amp; make below minimum wage (its a gov program so they can get away with that I suppose!), so the fact is I am below the poverty line, but again thats not the point. I think bitcoin is great for people like myself that understand the risk &amp; have the ability to hold a small amount of it into a savings. To claim bitcoin is wrong for ALL poor people is just wrong if your asking me
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:07:27
I do - Volatility is precisely why I'm buying bitcoins every week (albeit not very much b/c I'm so fucking broke &amp; it's risky).
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:51:05
I'm not OK with it &amp; I'm sure there are many others. Bitcoin will never have my full trust with that much power in the wallet of 1 anonymous person.

Correct - being poor in the USA is very different than being poor in some other parts of the world, but I don't think that's the argument is it?

OK - that's good, I just hope other people get that. The concern is that people who haven't been interested in bitcoin yet will see that title &amp; have a good chuckle to themselves b/c they've heard that from most of the media that bitcoin was a failure. I'm extremely critical of this documentary only b/c its such a great opportunity to tell the real story of bitcoin &amp; it just doesn't do that great of a job. This was the chance to get people excited about what this technology can/will do and if you're being honest with yourself I can't imagine you'd say this documentary does that. It's just not good enough &amp; when a better film does come out i'm afraid people will skip it b/c they think they already heard the story from this movie. And now its at fucking Sundance! Grrrreaat

Because it's still really cumbersome and ineffective as a currency
@_date: 2012-12-24 20:19:15
that's an interesting point - the psychological effects of a 1 bitcoin being worth a huge amount of dollars or whatever. I think you could also argue that it could go the other way too: Say 1 bitcoin = $1000. If, in this example, an apple cost $1, it'd then only cost .001 bitcoins! soooo cheap man!! haha -now of course when you take a second to look at it the price is obviously equivalent, but it may seem cheaper when viewed in terms of bitcoin... (And just from personal experience I find this to be true. I'll admit I have slightly less hesitation purchasing something in bitcoin because it does seem cheaper right now with bitcoin being valued higher than the dollar. I know thats pretty illogical - but hey that's my subconscious for you! )
@_date: 2012-12-24 19:47:09
So you weren't misjudging them afterall! just using code words! lol ok dude - i really have no idea what your talking about, but i think you might be worried that if the value goes up too much people will be left out because bitcoin would then, as a result, become unattainable for the "average" person. If that's your concern I'll point you here: 
So for me the divisibility is not an issue. 
ex: I can buy say 1 apple right now for X amount of bitcoins. Now say in the future the value of bitcoins shoots up by a multitude of 100. That same apple still has the same intrinsic value as before - that doesnt change (unless there's an apple shortage or something like that, but let's keep this simple). So assuming no big swings in the supply/demand of apples the new bitcoin cost would be = X/100. 
All currencies, bitcoin included, are just easy ways for people to exchange goods - They are only valuable because people believe they are. For a number of reasons, people -right now- believe 1 bitcoin is worth a bit over $13. Tomorrow that could change, but the fundamental value of the goods themselves, that we're trading these currencies for, aren't affected by these fluctuations.
@_date: 2012-03-23 20:13:01
1. buy $x worth of bitcoins each month 
2. leave it alone!
@_date: 2012-12-24 18:32:03
I'm confused why you say the coins "hold no value"? I've purchased plenty of things with bitcoin - i wouldn't be able to do that if it wasn't valuable...
@_date: 2012-12-24 16:00:09
touche! absolutely correct
@_date: 2012-12-24 18:28:03
Good luck. I've been making monthly investments in bitcoin for about a year now - after researching it for some time I finally felt comfortable with it's riskiness. Of course none of us can predict the future, so i can't tell you with any certainty whether or not my risk taking will be fruitful (in terms of the future value) or not. 
If the value does go up though I don't see why the investments I've made prior to that moment would be "unfair". Just as an example I'll get together with some buddies on occasion and give my bitcoin spiel and every single time I basically get laughed at (these are good friends, so it's all good natured of course!), but these guys have known from day one about bitcoin, just like me and yet they aren't investing - because they think it's "stupid" or a "scam". Have they done any research themselves? No, of course not those bastards! haha. BUT If in the future it turns out the bitcoin isn't a scam or dumb afterall I think they'd need some huge balls to tell me that i don't deserve to benefit from my investments. I'm taking on a risk they are not willing to take and therefore I think fully deserve the "possibility of reward" that hopefully come. If not, well atleast it's been extremely interesting!!

I don't think we've hit the bottom yet. I'm going to hold out a bit longer, but I will definitely be buying some more at some point in the future - hopefully I time it right - so far I've bought in at $15 an pretty much all the way down. FUUUUUUUUU!!!! But I have no regrets at all, there is just so much potential with Bitcoin, and that potential is only going to become more pronounced moving forward as the smart guys start designing around the protocol &amp; make it more friendly for people like my parents. 
I see this as a long term investment, the question is how long term. That's anybody's guess. But I got to think that at some point people will really find a use for a digital currency like Bitcoin. If I'm completely wrong, I'll be very surprised, but it's not like I'm throwing all my money into this - just what I can spare. At the very least it's kept me extremely entertained for the last couple of months. This is so much more interesting than stocks/bonds/etc. in my opinion - it's a brand new economy!
I'm actually kind of excited that we're going to be able to get Bitcoins for so cheap! ;)

I love this! After hours &amp; hours of time spent researching bitcoin, time usually preoccupied with frontpage reddit bullshit and sweet sweet pornography I've come away with a strong belief in the true value of this currency. Much smarter &amp; articulate people like Falkvinge could explain why it's valuable (economically &amp; socially) far better than I, but i'm fucking sold. What started as interest &amp; excitement has turned into the utmost respect &amp; utter fascination - I really think bitcoin could be revolutionary (so does wikileaks by the way). So i love the hysteria right now! I think it stems from emotions (fear) and has no real logical basis (that can be swifty argued against). So I've been held up with Dwolla for a motherfucking week an was unable to buy a goddamn thing, but the shit finally went through yesteray and now i can get bitcoin for a bit cheaper! this is prime "buy low sell high" time fellas! spread the hysteria all you want!! It can fluctuate to the lowest of the lows, but at some point it's tru value will be recognized - the global economy needs a currency like this. bitcoin is progress, and progress can not be stopped.

Yes these are proponents of Austrian economic thought. I though you said something about them predicting prices, bubbles, etc., etc. I know they preach a lot about inflation but that's about all I hear...speaking of

How would I figure out how many bitcoins this would mine per day?

I love this idea, unfortunately I have zero clue on how you'd make it :(
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:26:06
I had the same issue. I was dollar cost averaging a small amount every two weeks. My solution was to just buy every month now and bump the amount. I wish they would fix this though!
@_date: 2013-07-16 13:58:24
You rule, I've been trying to better understand this for awhile now. I just know myself, and based on how I behave I couldn't see how bitcoin deflation would have the effect that people like Krugman describe. I'm feeling more confident that my instinct on this is right

I'd say thinking twice about spending your money is a good thing. It's funny that in the $ economy we've been conditioned to believe the opposite. Sure for the $ economy that would be true - we must spend to grow and we must grow in order to pay off our debts, but FUCK THAT I say! Thank goodness for the bitcoin alternative where saving is actually rewarded. Economist like Krugman want us to believe that a deflationary currency won't work - so far that doesn't seem to be the case..... ;)

Well shit this doesn't seem good at all for the scalability of bitcoin. So am I understanding this correctly - that the bitcoin network can only handle 7 transactions per second? Can it be fixed?
@_date: 2013-01-30 22:58:11
they require verification to do more and more things as we go along. I'd guess that pretty soon it will be required to do anything. If your not comfortable giving them your identity i'd find another alternative.

has anyone tried plotting the # of subscriptions to the BTC price?
@_date: 2013-01-30 22:52:20
I'm not trying to sell bitcoins, only buying, so for me this works just fine: bitinstant ---&gt; blockchain mixer ---&gt; wallet on my PC. I'm racking up the fees this way but I see it as a small price to pay to convert my dollars to a digital currency.
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:01:30
you do realize that your comment is fucking worthless unless you can explain how you reached this conclusion don't you? (not saying you're wrong by the way)
@_date: 2013-01-30 22:55:39
I agree! haha. I mean it's probably not a big deal, but if bitcoin ever gets big like we all hope it does I don't think it's too far fetched for a government somewhere to make it illegal - I sure as hell don't need my identity associated with illegal shit. I even asked the guys at Mt. Gox if they'd delete my info after they verified me and they said they couldn't. Unless their policy has changed since they'll have your info on file for a long time. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 18:50:04
well shit man part of it's because nobody wants to upvote a submission that paints bitcoin in a negative light. i mean we're all **very excited** about bitcoin - so this sub is bound to be somewhat of a circle jerk. i figure once my sweet sweet mother says, "hey *_jt* have you heard of this cool new thing called bitcoin!?" then we can expect the price to jump up again. i mean even in the last boom/bust it never caught her attention. i'll make a post when that happens so you all can start buying! haha
@_date: 2013-07-16 13:41:18
Thank you! I've been trying to figure out why economists keep bringing up this deflation argument - it didn't make sense to me! So you're saying that prior to Bitcoin deflation was considered a bad thing because it was a result of bad economic conditions. On the other hand deflation in the Bitcoin economy would be the result of a growing economy/good thing so to suggest that the fiat deflation &amp; bitcoin deflation are the same wouldn't be accurate?

I've been using it for about a month and have no complaints so far. The verification process takes about a week and it takes about a week to convert cash to bitcoin. If you can handle that it's fantastic! I use it because it allows you to set up automatic purchase plans. My bitcoin investing strategy is to "dollar cost average" so this works perfect for that. I'm a former Mt. Gox user and for me Coinbase is vastly superior. Cheers!
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:14:44
I agree with the consensus here - a wall of text is typically not going to get read (in fact I didn't even read what you wrote). My test is if I could explain it so that my sweet granny understands in less than 1 minute that I'm on the right track. It's hard to do with bitcoin though, no doubt. I've seen some great graphics that explain things pretty well - maybe a link to something like that. Pictures are always good!

I bought some shares at 2.5 so I just have no idea, I feel like I was way late to the ballgame. it's the riskies investment I've ever made! there's just no fucking way to analyze this like I would a NYSE stock with financials I could pour through. I really want to come up with a P/E ratio but it seems like that's impossible. I just love investing &amp; bitcoin even more so and ASICMINER seems like the only stock that's worth a shit right now. no matter how high it goes you definitely didn't sell early like you say considering that you bought in at 0.7 and sold at 3.4 - I'm really very jealous! you keep being the debbie downer &amp; i'll keep reminding you that you're nothing but a hater ;)
