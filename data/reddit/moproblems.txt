I don't mean to come off as an A-hole when I post this, but you are only thinking about yourself. "hoping" that more and more people will jump on board with no incentive for them to ever get involved is a recipe for disaster. 
I thought about what you're saying. That was one of my main reasons as to why bitcoin would succeed. Unfortunately, for the other 99.9% of people that have no ties to bitcoin, this reasoning means nothing to them. They won't get involved without a major benefit to themselves.

I hope so. Those legacy banking costs you mentioned really need to disappear. It's unbelievable that in this century we allow Visa, Mastercard, et al to get away with this theft.

Great answer!
It's this sort of mentality &amp; the poster who responds with "math makes perfect sense" that turn people off from bitcoin. Criticism is critical with a new technology like this. There is nothing Anti-Bitcoin about my posts.

Most merchants see the benefit to accepting it. That's already established.
Now how do we get mainstream *consumers* to benefit by using bitcoin? Until that part gets sorted out, people will not choose bitcoin over traditional methods (cash back credit cards, cash itself, debit cards, etc.)

I have come across &amp; skimmed the link. It is pure speculation. There are several other alternative assets/money substitutes that I could think of that might be a more attractive alternative to the dollar. You can't necessarily say that bitcoin will definitely be IT. The fact that it doesn't make sense to use it as a currency doesn't help bitcoins case. 
I hope no one reading this thinks I'm "concern-trolling" because I'm absolutely not. I probably have more invested in BTC than the casual dabbler. I just can't ignore the obvious problem I see with the maths not adding up to actually use bitcoin for its intended purpose. I think it's an issue that doesn't get enough play.

But that means there's going to be $20M more worth of bitcoin available as opposed to none if the Winklevosses just held them themselves. BTC is fungible in this sense. That's $20M less that people will buy on Coinbase/et al. The good thing is it will expand the market. However the type of investors that will be in this IPO already do have the BIT fund to invest in. So I'm not sure how this'll work out.

They're basically cashing out 200k bitcoins. Not saying they will be dumped necessarily, but that's 200k more bitcoins that are available to investors/speculators/etc.

*Cliché warning*
"You're putting the cart before the horse."
"You cannot push on a string."
People need an incentive to use bitcoin in everyday situations. As it stands, there is no incentive (actually there is a disincentive!) to using bitcoin over traditional payment methods. 
Demand drives supply. If you can get consumers to use it - demand stores to accept (and I don't mean the tiny fraction of us bitcoin holders), then, and only then, does it take off.

I'm afraid that if this sort of critical mass doesn't happen soon, it leaves bitcoin vulnerable to competition and other risks. I couldn't even get one of my suppliers to accept free bitcoin to get them started (Chinese company).

THIS. THIS. THIS. THIS!!!
This is one of the biggest problems with bitcoin. I use my mastercard even when bitcoin is an option. Why? Because 1% cash back, fraud protection, chargeback if things go south, more convenient.
I thought to myself after purchasing stuff where btc was an option (didn't use it) what an idiot I am for believing that bitcoin is easier/safer than traditional methods. 
I don't know what the answer is to turn bitcoin around. I do see the potential, but there is no motivation to use it over traditional methods. I can see the motivation for a business to accept bitcoin (lower fees etc), but I just don't see why consumers would want to use it. I am in the camp that demand drives supply, not the other way around. So what can we do to change this? There has to be a major incentive to use it. I still haven't come up with an incentive to sway people (even myself!) away from traditional methods after 2 years of being involved in bitcoin.

when exactly will they *have* to use it?
remember that it takes 1% (buying the bitcoin) + another 1% (reward) + difference in bid/ask price to spend it versus a rewards credit card. You need like a 3% reward, not to mention giving up protections offered by a cc/debit card.

but is he wrong? Gox dealt a permanent blow to bitcoin - worse than even China's quasi-banning of it. whether people want to admit or not, it's still in the back of a lot of people's minds (especially mainstream investors). Some may have forgotten about it. Some will stay away forever. Others want to see the price collapse even further because they believe those involved in the theft are still holding tens of thousands of stolen bitcoins. Root for Bitcoin, root for bitcoin to get cheaper.

I looked over the filing. At roughly $20/share for .20 BTC, that implies a price of $100 per Bitcoin for IPO investors and adds 200,000 bitcoins into circulation. 
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but how is this a good thing?
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:30:42
The fact that people think there's a 0% chance it could go to $50 worries me. Bitcoin has systemic issues that mostly get ignored, or swept under the rug. Like  this thread I started which made it to the front page and quickly got down voted by almost 50% of those who saw it. Even Peter Thiel stated his biggest concern was that bitcoin was not used enough for purchases to succeed. It's easy to ignore the problem when the price is skyrocketing higher. But when we're in a bear market in an extremely bearish descending triangle pattern, this is the time to address &amp; try to fix the issues that are holding back others from investing.

I'm onboard. It needs to be done pronto. It should be done just before the Feds go to sell their 100k coins to get all the panic selling out of the way from this and just in case anything catastrophic happens.

Fiat will still exist, but I can tell you right now the Euro is going to end up being a disaster. Possibly as early as this weekend...
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:36:13
Thanks. So what did they auction in November..was that the SR coins? I'm assuming the 100k is DPR's? Is there any way Ulbricht would actually be able to fight to keep his coins? Or are they goners unless he's found not guilty?

What's their address?

There's always a house. But "it's" just observing right now. You know what they say about keeping your enemies closer...

 surge in Greek rates- a stunning 84bps in 1 day.
 Bank stocks reflecting insolvency
Greece blocked the sale of their main port. Greece blocked the sale of their main electric company. Tsipras calling for post-WWII German style write-offs of Greek debt. There will not be any new bailouts.

yup. This is my biggest fear with bitcoin and one reason I'm bearish. You have no idea how cut-throat [the Chinese] could be. F2pool will mine at a loss just to grab more and more market share. until they own it. It makes sense.
