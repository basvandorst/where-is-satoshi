yo, put 4 spaces after each line you want a break on, like the balance lines so they get formatted correctly.

opening in a virtual machine ftw. i have high hopes for it being legit though due to the account and website both being taken
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:03:15
Sure, where to? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:52:02
Any BTC given by you were sold on the market already.. in order to return them they would have to be bought back by Bitpay/Coinbase .. it just seems messy.
BTC returns will probably start happening once companies hold them. Maybe 3 years from now

Its ok I donated all of them to the Mark Karpeles Frapaccino Fund
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:21:41
Gotcha.

omg that led to a brainwallet with 10 btc
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:00:45
look for daves bitcoin recovery services.
if you dont want to pay him his fee this is all he does:
runs a custom brute force script (need to have a general idea of what the passwod was) on a dedicated amazon instance 
he goes into more detail on his site.
hes good at what he does though

Eh, I read this guys posts and tweets and I really don't get a good feeling from him. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:34:20
damn, im saving all this in case it gets taken down. no worries to all those getting here late

Refunding BTC makes them an exchange basically. Lots of legal issues and market issues that they want to avoid I believe

Is this evidence of piracy by Mt Gox or that the program was built by the leakers?
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:33:20
Alright, so it was only useful in determining that the program was a livecode app.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:39:23
interesting report. thanks for making that. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:27:43
edit: alright it has enough
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:25:41
I don't think it is well protected. 
I also think it was always meant to be internal to Gox. 
I don't think it's malware at all. 
But I can't verify any of those claims, and I understand that it could be connecting to a malicious server, so I am looking forward to your report.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:49:14
Awesome. Im following another user who is reverse engineering the program.
Another found the server that it connects to (gox's sql server)
So far it seems like a legit internal program. But I realize code could have been hidden inside.
Anyways, let me know what you find.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:13:52
Keep me updated. I actually ran the program, inside a VM though. I'm wondering if this program actually connects to Gox servers. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:23:18
Interesting indeed.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:47:48
No I dont. Just ran it around in my mind and if they accepted BTC and then gave dollars back they could be used to launder dirty BTCs. I'm sure they dont want to deal with that. 
Or maybe its just convoluted having to recieve payment from the customer directly, but its actually routed through bitpay/coinbase... idk. Its just a lot of trouble for them to return cash.

Edit at 1:21 EST:
Files are as reported. MSE scan was clean on all files.
The dump contains many CSV files, a PDF file, and some executables. A screenshot of the executable is given in the dump. It is not a virus but might be an accounting type program used by Tibanne/Gox.
A slightly detailed list of files (CSV, PDF, etc):
1. Detailed trading info dating back to 2011. Includes data on the relationship with Coinlab.
2. Account balances and related info.
3. Tranfers 
4. Marks curriculum vitae
Will update again when I look at the CSV files closely. Need something that can open them.

@_date: 2014-03-09 19:58:58
Awesome.

No. You are turning your password into an algorithm, which is what computers excel at.
Instead just remember random words like how the electrum seed works.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:19:18
Yeah there's no need to run it. I did though just to see what happens.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:52:02
some on have confirmed as well
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:19:05
Nothing it's just some Gox program. If it is malicious then I wouldn't know it until I realized that I lost passwords or something. It can't steal my bitcoins cause I don't have any that exist outside of the blockchain.
