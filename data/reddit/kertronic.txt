This is awesome, and from the video seems very well done. One suggestion, how about displaying a corresponding QR code just below the bitcoin payment address? This would make paying from a smart phone super easy.

As someone who trades locally on localbitcoins--god I hope so.

There has long been a solution for this problem everywhere else in the world. For crowded bars or really busy nights you take payments at the cashier who then prints a receipt/ticket that you give to the bar tender of you choice. The bar tender makes your drink and never handles cash or payments. As far as tipping goes you could choose to leave a tip in a tip jar, easily visible QR code for bitcoin, or include it in your initial purchase. However, tipping is not all that common outside the USA.

If it's true that there is a lot of profit there, then there is a lot of money to be made by anybody else operating in that market segment. Any real competition will drive the fees down significantly. Any increase in volume due to popularity will compound this even more, giving much more incentive for others to compete in this space. 
tl;dr: To the moon.

I can vouch for everything jhdowner said and for him as well, it's a fairly tightknit community down here! If they will be in the capital on the 10th there will be a bitcoin meetup with plenty of people willing to sell. The meetup is listed on meetup.com.

In a much better position than if one was holding dollars. Say you are paying 15% capital gains taxes. Would you rather lose 50% of your cash assets by holding USD or only 15% of 50% (or 7.5%) by holding another asset?
Edit: Also as points out, one needs only pay this tax when "cashing out" so to speak by trading the asset for dollars or another asset. Otherwise the gains are as of yet unrealized and not taxed.

Better late than never. But I really do hope you are getting paid for such trivial posts.

As you can all see from the post above, the trolls put in a minimal amount of effort. The easist, least creative ad-hominems possible, just as OP says. This well known troll has been with us for quite a while.

Long before the word 'bit' was borrowed for use in computer science it was English for ["small piece, fragment"]( and later:


And so we've come full circle. It's time for the bit to come home.

Thanks for the correction.

The drinks can be any price and the amount paid and/or drink name would be  listed on the ticket.

Excellent example of what volatilepointer is talking about

Yes. Essentially you buy a voucher from a dedicated cashier. Then redeem the voucher for your drink with a dedicated bartender. It is not an uncommon practice outside the USA.

And here come the trolls...

Your post was worth the read for this part alone, haha. 
But on  more serious note, I've also lived in China up until about a year ago. And I've also used the BTC China exchange for the financial freedom it provides. So I can verify everything you just said on the topic. 
There are also additional restrictions on international wire transfers for foreigners. ~~I believe we can only do transfers of 50k RMB (about 8k USD) and that may even be a yearly limit?~~ (see below for restrictions). And as you said, if you don't speak fluent Chinese it can be very difficult. I was fortunate enough to live  near a major bank branch in one of the most foreigner concentrated areas and they were always very accommodating for me as an English speaker. This is not by any means typical though and certainly not something that you can rely on. Personally, I'll take the blockchain, any day. 
Edit: I just found an article about some of the restrictions on banking for foreigners. Apparently it applies to foreigners employed in the gray market. To the tune of a 500 USD limit per day. See:

Post your own ad. If there really is a 10% markup then someone will take you up on your offer, just give it a few days.
@_date: 2012-07-18 04:11:55
Sounds like you came out ok (other than your phone getting stolen). If you haven't already, don't forget to transfer all your coins to a new wallet. How/where was it stolen btw?

I'm in China at the moment and maybe we can work something out. ~~Just out of curiousity, why do you need to buy that particular item from taobao, instead of a bit closer to home, say from this [seller](
EDIT: I didn't read that auction carefully, as those are obviously completely different parts. Exactly which model is that?

Article author and link submitter fail. However, the 'socially irresponsible' part may have some significance. Maybe the attention will encourage them to run the client or use a functioning 3rd party for bitcoin donations.
Edit: Bitcoin donations link fixed... Guess it worked!

Just out of curiosity, are there good (non-sexist) reasons for your loan distribution to be 97.94% of the female gender? I.e. do women have a higher repayment rate, etc.? I do know that Kiva focuses on women but is there any evidence that this is preferable to lending to both genders with equal opportunity? Do you know if there is a similar project planned for men?
I applaud your achievements in Kiva and I'm excited to hear about your ideas and plans with Bitcoin. And I hope you take my questions seriously. Thanks!

Who would register a new account just to comment on downvotes? Maybe to add to the upvotes?
@_date: 2011-10-12 23:09:47
Upvote for the honest reply and interesting link. Thanks!

I would not like to encourage a bubble. I would like to encourage bitcoin adoption. Could you explain how this would be inefficient? Thanks!

I would love to visit the coffee farms. I might have to take you up on your offer. Where are you at in Colombia?

So in Argentina the 'big local and multinational companies' are the ones printing Argentinean pesos? I thought it was the state/private bank??
