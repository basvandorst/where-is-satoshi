I've used purse.io 3 times, two went perfect. The last one I think the buyer tried to scam me by cancelling the order. They even called for support on the site and tried to pressure me to release the bitcoins to them saying the item showed delivered, but purse.io support cancelled the transaction and refunded me the money after they looked into it. So they're safe, but be careful with the buyers.

Bitcoin is based on public/private key cryptography, so if the security of your private keys is compromised you can have your bitcoin stolen. Modern cell phones if updated and running a wallet offer a decent amount of security for spendable amounts of bitcoin, but if you're going to be holding more and/or using a computer which can be hacked you should look at hardware wallets. Hardware wallets keep your private keys off the computer and have various ways of keeping you protected in making your transactions. Hardware wallets are secure enough to even use on an infected PC. I own an Trezor and a Ledger hardware wallet, both of which I would recommend. The Trezor and Keepkey offer a bit more protections because they have their own screens to show the address you're sending bitcoin to, as well as concealing your pin from the computer.
To start, bitcoin.org has some info on wallets and security. Start with a smartphone wallet and get a few dollars to play with. Try purse.io or buy something on Overstock.com. I like Circle for getting bitcoin, transferring it to my other wallets instead of keeping it on their service. You could also play around transferring it between the Circle app and your wallet to practice using it. You can download Mastering Bitcoin as a free ebook which has a nice section on how bitcoin works, and goes much deeper if you're curious.

After all that they're going to be much more secure. I've used them and never had a problem, and it's a great service for exchanging coins. Some people have to learn the hard way that many people are amoral, so just don't ignore the warning signs.

I got mine within a couple weeks with normal shipping from CZ. Hit New York pretty quick and had to wait for it to be trucked to California by USPS.

Yep, use MultiBit with my Trezor on the PC for storage and larger transactions. The phone is handy in the same way you keep cash in your pocket. Be nice to see support for the Ledger wallet added also or did I miss that it's there? I wonder if Ledger allows the phone app to be accessed by other wallets?

Isn't this just the Chinese pools that are dominating right now, with many miners within those pools distributed around the world like myself. Most of us are just going to where we get the best payout, but we can easily change pools if something happens.

I run a full node on a Pi 2, and the thing I learned real fast was to get the file system off the SD card. Those corrupt over time and aren't up to the task. I use the SD card just to boot and switch to an external 1 TB hard drive, and with the Pi 3 there is a way to have it boot directly to an external drive. I do have a Pi 3 server that uses a 128GB flash drive with all its file system on it that is reliable. Also, a full node can use a lot of your data which might be limited with your ISP. So you can limit the number of connections to keep the bandwidth in use limited. I have mine limited to 20 connections so it doesn't take to large a chunk out of my bandwidth cap or interfere too much with streaming video as we're cord cutters.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:48:34
Mine has been up 53 days, 71 GB up, 15 GB down, and that's limited to 20 connections. My Pi is slower, but with no limit it had gotten up over 100 connections. You can use 'bitcoin-cli getnettotals' to see this data. What I do is setup a "screen" session, which is a terminal app that lets you detach and reattach later. So say you SSH into your node, you can just do a "screen -r" and reconnect a terminal you have running. In that session I'll have a few commands setup so I can easily page through statuses, 'watch bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo', 'watch bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo', 'watch bitcoin-cli getnettotals', 'watch df -h', 'top'. Watch is a command that will refresh the command you give it every 2 seconds, or you can change the interval. You'll have to learn how to use screen and its commands, but it invaluable if you're managing servers.

I use my Trezor with MultiBit HD mostly. And I use my Ledger hardware wallet with Electrum on occasion so I'm not too worried.

I run an S3 on Antpool (450 GH/s), but use PPS. I make about 0.0012 to 0.0013 BTC in a 24 hour period. So multiplying that to approximate your capacity would match your balance. Depending on your power costs, you might not be netting much or any money. I'm pretty tight here in California. Basically I am mostly converting power company dollars into bitcoin (and supporting the network along with my raspberry pi node).
Antpool also pays you every evening whatever you have earned (west coast USA here). If you're mining full time with them maybe try PPS. I think the PPLNS is for if you have your miners hopping around pools. I'm new myself, so going off what I remember reading. We'll probably get some more experienced people chiming in here.

Big companies are even slower to fix bugs and security issues than open source/free software projects. And when the source code is available for security reviews a lot of issues get corrected even earlier. Now factor in that the elites that run the world control big mega-corps via their boards, do you think they'll give you better protection from something that threatens their very own world finance system and how they transfer wealth from the debt slaves?

The content companies and governments make it all a huge mess. By accident the other day I was coming out from my VPN in the Netherlands and fired up Netflix, and they had a lot of movies not here in the US. One I wanted to watch but couldn't rent as it was a buy only in Google Play. Stupid companies practically drive you to steal their content, or at least the limited amount worth watching.

Any bank offering you money to open an account with a considerable amount of money is probably doing so because they have too much outstanding debt to deposits. Being they only hold a small fraction anyway, you probably don't want to hold your FIAT treasure with that bank. Especially with all these financial bubbles ready to pop. Depending on that federal protection minus haircuts might not be that solid a footing.

You won't have that many until you download the whole block chain. Then it will depend on your hardware. My node is a Raspberry Pi 2, so the software seems to limit connections to the hardware and performance. Most I've seen is about 63 connections which will bog down the Pi. In a couple weeks its sent out over 50GB of data, so keep that in mind if you have limits with your provider. I use my node as a trusted node with SPV wallets, so I didn't want to limit connections, but I may.
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:00:15
You can input your own node into your SPV wallet as a trusted node and be sure one of the nodes your wallet connects to is secure and valid. And you're assisting others using SPV wallets. Plus you can monitor the status of the block chain as well as learning more about the software and client commands.

They are just trying to scare people away from bitcoin to promote their own alternative. The real media assaults haven't even started yet. When you look at the institutions signed on with their effort, they will be able to fund some real hit pieces on bitcoin as Western media is completely corrupt for their elite masters.

You deposit money with Circle and then you can send it as bitcoin to any bitcoin address. I use the service to send bitcoin to my wallets. I wouldn't use Circle as a bitcoin wallet though you can have your Circle account be bitcoin or dollars. FYI, if you cash out Circle back to your bank account it's supposed to take a couple days.

I just reconfigured a Pi 2 node with a 1TB USB HD and after it synced the whole block chain its only using 116 GB total including Raspbian OS and the whole blockchain. It only has 1 GB of memory, and due to limited hardware only serves up 20-50 peer connections, but its working fine. Main thing for a Pi is only use the Micro SD card for boot, with the root file system on the HD. The SD cards will corrupt over time, not good for a lot of random reads and writes. Even if you put .bitcoin on another drive you'll still see corruption eventually on the SD card.

I prefer a more conservative approach and like Segregated Witness with the soft fork option and future benefits. And some of the devs and fanboys on the Classic side I just find annoying which gives me pause. When people are being manipulative and over the top to force something, that says something about their motives. Even during the spamming, I had no trouble with transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-08 01:42:14
Circle is an easy way to get bitcoin to send to your wallet, but I wouldn't use them as a wallet. If you have a phone that gets regular and timely backups then just run your own wallet there. If you'll want to use serious quantities of bitcoin I'd suggest a hardware wallet like a Trezor which is safe to use on an infected computer or phone.
@_date: 2016-03-23 06:43:28
What's the status on the Ledger wallet Chrome app? I still have a hard time getting into it and usually I have to do a reset in order to get it to sync properly. Slicker app wallet than MyTrezor when working, though I usually use my Trezor with Multibit HD which bypasses MyTrezor.

During the ruckus yesterday I swept some paper wallets and then moved money back with no issue. My wallet did raise the fee slightly on sending the money back to the paper wallets (pinned at my desk for coworkers to try out bitcoin), but the transactions went right through as normal. These fees are way under any alternative, and the sky isn't falling. I find all those that act like bitcoin is about to fail to be disingenuous. And having started up a node over the weekend and looking at the total blockchain size, making the blocks bigger is going to be problematic for a lot of people to run nodes. SegWit is a solid move to give more transactions without blowing up the total blockchain size.

Ver is a douche. He's deceitful in his comments and arguments. He's as had as the news media talking heads on TV in his distortions and misrepresentations. So if he's this dishonest in front of us, what is he doing outside of our view?

You're giving too much credit to Hearn. He played a part but it was his employer and those that signed on with them that paid for the Times piece which was an orchestrated plan to discredit and taint bitcoin to strengthen their alternative. From following transactions yesterday there was over $500 million in value wiped out and those that cashed out lost real money. It was all a disgusting display that exemplifies those that run financial institutions. As the major banks and Hearn's employer fight for their system I'd look for these orchestrated media attacks to increase as well as placing native ads for their product. Eventually they will pressure their government servants to get more involved and attack. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 02:17:07
I use both a Trezor and Ledger wallet. Both are secure to use on an infected PC (recommend the Ledger phone app as the security card could possibly be compromised with enough uses). The Ledger Chrome app is a bit nicer than MyTrezor's web app, but I usually use my Trezor with Multibit HD. The screen for pin entry and signing of the transaction is very secure on the Trezor.
Also Keepkey has a nice hardware wallet like the Trezor with a bigger screen and they reduced the price to $99.

I could do without seeing the douche Roger Ver myself, but it looks good.

Just remember that Roger Ver is pursuing his own financial goals and not what is in the best interest of Bitcoin and those that will benefit the most from Bitcoin. He's just another selfish person trying to tell people what they should do for his financial reasons. The last interview I heard with him made me lose all respect for the man as he whined incessantly like an impudent child.

I just fired up a Raspberry Pi 2 core node, 32GB microSD card for OS, 128GB flash drive for /.bitcoin blockchain directory, under $100 and it doesn't use much power. And I can SSH in and play with bitcoin-cli commands while reading Mastering Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:03:49
As Abe Lincoln said "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."  
The real thing with Roger Ver is he's not as smart as he thinks he is. You would think that his time in prison would have bridled that pride some, but no. Give him time, he'll douchebag his way into a prison cell again.

No, wanted a full blockchain. You can limit the connections if you need to though.

The Keep Key looks nice and is similar to the Trezor. If they would have lowered their price sooner, I'd probably have bought one. Myself, I own a Ledger and Trezor and both hodl bitcoin. I'm satisfied with both. Devices with screens to protect your PIN gives a bit better security. The security card and app make the Ledger usable still.

I ran a pi 2 node, and I found the main problem was the sd card which limited disk operations and eventually led to corruption. So I've reconfigured it to have the root file system and the block chain on a USB hard drive (1TB) and its about a third of the way through downloading the blockchain in a day and half. Its now pinning the CPUs and seems to be doing better, but we'll see how it does after it finishes downloading the block chain. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:21:08
It always downloads the blockchain fine. Its after it has been running for a couple months I start to get disk errors that force me to redownload the blockchain. If I have problems this time I'll look at one of the other little computer boards that has more power and memory and convert the pi 2 into a Tor bridge or security camera.

You can put it in a safety deposit box, fire proof safe, or hide it in your house, parents house... Someone was making a metal kit so you could put your key in a holder with engraved metal that would survive a house fire. You could hide that in your house and not worry about recovering it in case of fire. You could add some more options, offline computer, encrypted file, thumb drive.... Whatever makes you feel safe where you could recover your key. I've had my Ledger drop my key once which was a known bug they've supposedly fixed, so do make sure you have your backup seed safe. And hardware wallets can fail, so with the key you can recover the bitcoin at least.

He's an elite Schill. I find his mannerisms and body language quite funny while he makes his rather unintelligent arguments he himself doesn't believe. Note that the purpose is not to inform, but to scare the sheeple away.

How hard is it to question and investigate things for yourself?

When everyone was complaining I swept some paper wallets and then transferred the money back and I had no issues. My wallet did a very minor increase in fees on the payouts and they were in the next block. If it's marked with a lower priority it might take a while, but the fees are very reasonable. Being a miner I'm all for fees, :)
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:55:50
Just have to wait. My last couple miner payouts were the same priority, and it took a few blocks before it was put in a block and confirmed.

Yes. Micro SD cards were designed for large file writes like image files. They don't do well with a lot of random reads and writes of smaller files all at the same time. So for certain applications with a Pi get the file system on an external HD or a good flash drive. It will be much more stable and performance will improve.

I've been trying for a few days in AirBitz, no Starbucks cards. Trying to demo it for some coworkers to get them using bitcoin and saving some money even though I can't stand Charbucks coffee myself (I buy green coffee beans and roast it myself, e.g. not over roasted for shelf life).

I have a Raspberry Pi 2 that is running a full node with a 1 TB external HD. The secret is to get the file system off the micro SD card. It slows down file operations and will get corrupted eventually (even if you turn off a lot of logging). At the least just use the SD card to boot and get the file system up and running, but there is a way to boot straight to the external HD with Pi 3. I let mine build the block chain from scratch, took a bit, but it did it. Mine was starting to take over 100 connections, but the bandwidth usage was getting too great so I limited it to 30. With 30 connections I figure about 100 GB of bandwidth a month and allows me to still stream TV and do other things. Its been working for months with no disc corruption.
Only negative to limiting connections is I put it in my wallets as a trusted node, and sometimes its not available, :).

I ran an Antminer S3 in the house through the winter and it kept the place warmer overnight and cut down on running electric room heaters. But once it got warm I moved it to the garage. So it will work, but you'd need a way to vent outside for excess heat or warmer weather. I'd really do the math though and see if it would be profitable with your electricity rate and consider that mining returns have dropped some and we near the halving of the block payout. I did the math for the newest box they offer, and it just wouldn't be profitable for me in CA. At the halving I'm going to eBay my S3.

I've had it glitch a couple times. Just had it rescan the blockchain and it was fine. I don't believe I've had a problem with the latest version. I do use it with my Trezor which holds my private keys.
