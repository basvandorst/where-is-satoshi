Real bitcoin price remains the same. We simply denominate with bits

How does this affect the “real price”

Hah, +1. I was thinking we do a phased approach. Use bits until 1 bit = $100 usd, at which point we’d start using sats.

I agree with the spirit of your message, and maybe “official” wasn’t the right word. However, I do believe as BTCs price continues to rise, there are some benefits referring to bits, where 1,000,000 bits = 1 btc. 
Bread wallet has used it for some time, and I’ve always found it convenient for lesser amounts.

Based on the reception of this post, i guess not

Not sats, but 1,000,000 bits = 1 btc

you have to think a bit beyond that.
that $150mm you refer to only applies to the orderbook on one exchange. suppose someone (stupidly) market sells into the entire 150mm worth of orders. the market will adjust for that move, and likely many buyers will flock in to fill the orderbooks once more. that's how the market works.
also trade volume and marketcap does matter -- the higher the volume, the more "accurate" the marketcap. i can sell 100 btc @ 14kUSD each for 1.4 million USD without a problem. i cannot do that if there are no buyers to support that volume of transaction.

market cap is merely one of several metrics, but it is quite relevant for bitcoin as a measurement of success/adoption with supported trade volume. 


if that's how you define market cap, then no traditional stock should have market cap as a valuation metric. not every share of google is going to sell for $1,000 if a 100% of its shares were sold at once. again, that's how the market works.
you're doing the equivalent of quibbling that ebitda is a useless valuation metric simply because it doesn't account for capital changes. 
it's much better to look at things from broader and multiple contexts.
