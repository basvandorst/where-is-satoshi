Agreed, all they are missing for me is a cold-storage or 'vault' like solution.

Andreas deserves this. What a community bitcoin'ers have built. Proud to be apart of it. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:10:48
Great question. Can someone help us out here? Are there any rough averages for the amount of daily transactions that are irrelevant? 
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:59:07
Yes. Thank you for explaining. Would love to hear a rough number on this as well. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:47:46
IMO it's tough to compare the two. Betfair has completely different use cases for it's daily transactions/volume than everything they're talking about. The point is, this article is outlining the growth of btc comparing it to other transmittance &amp; payment technologies.

Most of the exchanges in India (Unocoin, Coinsecure, Zebpay, BTXIndia, etc) have spoken with the RBI (reserve bank of India, equivalent of the central bank in other countries) and have approval to operate in India. 
They keep in close contact. I have a hard time believing how much validity this article or comments have. I would like to see an official comment from one of the exchanges or parties in India that are in close contact with the government to see the real extent of this politician's outcry.

I'm not from China and never had accounts on Chinese exchanges. What was required before all of this to signup and trade?
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:53:13
Me too, until I read this: 
"We don't enable direct consumer trading, we market make on all major exchanges, and provide OTC liquidity services to institutions."
Blog post talking about it further:

If you speak with customer support they are pretty helpful in these situations (I know from experience). Just be open with them, they will be willing to work with you. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:26:46
Love the competition that is happening in India btwn Coinsecure.in, Unocoin, Zebpay, &amp; BTCXIndia. It is great for the community. Lets make more countries like this!
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:54:24
Yeah I would reach out to bitpay &amp; steam. The earlier the better. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:22:43
Bitcoin is the killer app. 
We're just in the infrastructure phase. Building nice ux layers, nodes, and laying more "dial-up cables" (internet parallel) will help better the experience. It's just going to take a few years. Enjoy the ride. :) 
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:18:20
"Estimated Confirmation Time: Very Soon (High Priority)" from blockchain.info. You'll be okay! Don't sweat it. 
This does point out how early we are in this industry. Sending money shouldn't be so worrisome. Excited to see what the next wave of founders/devs/designers come up with to help better this experience. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 20:19:39
Maybe the best thing for $BTC price?
@_date: 2016-02-04 18:46:04
No problem! Appreciate it regardless. Somewhat new to reddit as well :) 
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:17:35
Good feedback. After re-reading, not sure if I am a fan of how I did this within the post. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:16:12
As stated in the post, it is aimed at people that aren't within the Bitcoin community. Using mainstream people &amp; concepts to get the average person to take an interest in Bitcoin was my intention, hopefully it's working! 
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:13:55
Yes, thanks for the correction, changed it in the post. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 01:51:49
Great to hear. Hopefully she goes to work tomorrow and tells her friends that Bitcoin is for real, because Ashton supports it. :) 
@_date: 2016-09-29 04:45:10
Life happens. You need value to live. I'm glad that Bitcoin gave you more measure of value than other currencies did. Your buying/selling has supported the community well! Thanks, and may you hodl once again my friend. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:22:32
I'm sorry to hear this. Love Kraken. What was the reason Apple gave you for removing it? How did it pass initially if it was violating some of the rules?
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:26:48
I would love to have another 'blockchain' expert jump into one of these threads and really hear their opinions. The AMA with the CTO of a blockchain company was great. Are there any more threads that I'm missing that educate people on why 'blockchains' can actually help (even if it's not all that much :O)?

KYC &amp; AML specialist here for another company in the space. This is not Coinbase's fault. This is because your fraud rating was too high and goes against their current AML Policy that FINCEN holds them to. Some advice below. 
* Did you use a burner phone # when signing up? 
* Is your DL expired? 
* Are you messing with your IP(s)? 
* Have you been caught of fraud in the past? 
* Have you had an NSF in your bank accounts lately?
* Did you do something against their TOU on one of your transactions? 
One of these reasons, a mix of them, or something similar was the reason you got the boot. Not their fault. IMO they're a great company who has brought a lot more "regular" people to the space. 
If you don't want to deal with regulation/US law then there are plenty of other wallets to sign up for and other ways to buy/sell your coins. You're just digging yourself a deeper hole if you sign up for a legitimate company and expect to do illegitimate things, in 9/10 cases the company is right (in a business sense they can get more in trouble (lose more money) for letting you be a user &amp; transacting then simply dropping you).
I hope this helped!

Xapo card, Shift card with Coinbase, and the Bitpay debit card are the most well known. Interested in hearing if there are any new ones that have come out. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:38:06
Do you know why they are shutting down? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:45:07
When searching "Poloniex lending" they are the first result. Can't seem to find anything else about them online. Does anyone have any experience using or dealing with them? Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:54:04
So beautiful. We need more story telling of this caliber in the industry. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 04:51:49
Did this turn out to be Abra, or spam? Have seen a few companies do this in the past, I received one from [Circle App]( a few years ago (non-related to CirclePay). 
Never turns out well for the company. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:00:04
Can't you look at the receive address you sent it to in your tx history on Bitkong? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:05:10
You can either make him a paper wallet or sign up for coinbase and send bitcoin to his email address. That will queue him an email where he will have instructions on how to create an account, and claim his Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:24:50
Love that Bitcoin is being referenced to in the classroom :-). What kind of teacher/professor is it? 
@_date: 2016-10-29 17:28:19
Thanks for translating this! Some great coverage. Love how bullish India seems to be on $BTC. It seems like a land grab war right now for the exchanges there (zebpay, unocoin, coinsecure.in). Which one do you personally use, and why? 
@_date: 2016-10-02 04:34:41
This is great. I'm so excited to see more and more localized bitcoin companies popping up in so many countries. Making the ecosystem larger, and larger. Exciting times!
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:18:10
In the US. What u/one_line_commenter said is correct. Not sure on their exact fee though. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 19:53:42
Let's say less than ~$100/day. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:44:32
You can also buy the textbook on amazon. That's what I did. Reading through it/taking notes on my own.
The textbook helps layout the conjunction of all the fields that have made up Bitcoin (cryptography, consensus, digital money, etc). It also gives you the history of digital cash, it was so interesting to me to learn that that has been a slow iteration over decades. 
Best of luck! 
@_date: 2016-10-01 06:36:03
Great founders, great team. I hope this is only the beginning of other countries besides US, EU, &amp; China to start pushing more volume.

It's not easy to become a first mover in a particular region. In short, three things you need to focus on. 
* 1) Local laws. Is Bitcoin defined in Albania (asset, currency, or nothing)? You need to get approval from the central bank one way or another (through licenses, informal write-off, etc).
* 2) A banking relationship. This is huge. You need to find a bank that will hold you, and not drop you. Currently one of the biggest hurdles for off/on-ramps in the space. 
* 3) Tech. The technology is a hurdle in itself. With the amount of exchanges currently getting "hacked" in the space, you either need to be an expert yourself or find a white-label partner that you can trust. 
There are a plethora of other things (finding market-makers, branding, liquidity, and more) but if you can achieve the above points you have yourself a business. Best of luck! The world needs more exchanges (nodes) for digital currencies to take off. We commend you for posting this. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:18:25
This is solid. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 04:50:17
Are you interested in trading yourself, or are you only interested in finding someone to do it for you? 
There doesn't seem to be a dedicated bitcoin hedge fund that I have seen yet. I'm sure there are some people in the world currently working on them, hoping this is a thing, soon. 
There is margin trading on a lot of the exchanges. This will allow you to front some money to traders, and earn a percentage of it back based off of how they do. 
There are also companies like BullBear Analytics that help educate you about trading Bitcoin and Altcoins. They let you follow their trades, you get access to a Slack channel, and some other cool stuff. Full disclosure I help this company out. I think they're great for getting people acclimated to trading. 
You can also look at a few of the bitcoin lending sites; btcjam, etc. They allow you to lend btc to people all around the world and collect interest. 
There are a lot of different routes you can go.  You should do your research before choosing any one.

I just answered this in a similar [post]( (specific to Albania). From experience, this is what you need to launch a regulated Bitcoin exchange. 
It's not easy to become a first mover in a particular region. In short, three things you need to focus on.

If you just want to become the largest local broker-dealer, or "the Bitcoin guy" in your region, there's nothing stopping you from doing that. It's risky, but you can flip $BTC and make decent profit if you have ways of getting it in an illiquid region (a friend in another country, bank accounts in another country, etc).
And for all intensive purposes, the US is the hardest place in the world to launch a digital asset exchange because of FINCEN/state laws. Plus the market is already saturated in the US with exchanges. Find a country that doesn't currently have an exchange, launch there. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 17:01:55
Try Bitquick or Localbtc. Good luck!

I must be mistaken as the OP is. Can you help explain further? On the URL I posted it says *"0.05% deposit fee on our side"*. How are we misreading? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:39:46
After doing some dealing in the region, you won't find one that will do it knowingly. I would suggest reaching out to any localbitcoin, Abra, or Paxful traders that may be in the region. 
You can also search facebook, whatsapp, or telegram for local trading groups. There are individuals that do p2p and large OTC trades there. 
Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:48:47
In the next three weeks you will probably gain it back. 
HODL, and stop checking the price so often. Get entrenched in the technology, after learning what it can do for the world, you will get it.

Thanks, was misreading this. Corrected

Erik was one of industry's first supporters. He has done a lot for Bitcoin and will continue to do so. This smells like FUD to me.
