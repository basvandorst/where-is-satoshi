Next time you find something like that just tell me about it instead. I'll steal close to a million dollars off them and go you halves.

Years salary on bitcoins. Nicely done

I'm confused as to why you guys are wanting but coin to be held and regulated by the mainstream industries? 
Isn't that getting rid of the whole point of having a decentralised currency.

Worth a shot man. People have given people money for more stupid reasons than wanting to learn. Figured it was worth a shot with some progressives like you folk. 
And I would go to the library if there was one in range mate.

Thanks, I would but there isn't one I can reliably get to unless its like a week apart which isn't too feasible. 
I think I'm just going to buy a bunch of paper and just transfer any thing I need to source and the like from my phone to paper and back again. 
Sort of like tabs but physical. 
Just figured it was worth a shot rather than doing the whole waiting thing.

Oh awesome. Thank you
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:09:43
Thanks. Didn't really know things like that exist. 
Sorry for posting in the wrong sub. But going off replies I don't think I'd get a good response there either.

How do I buy $150 worth of Bitcoin and get my friend to receive it in Istanbul?
@_date: 2015-09-11 20:33:57
Awesome thanks :)

Thank you

Lesser of two evils. 
Everyone's just a temporarily embarrassed millionaire that thinks it'll be their pockets being lined through enough hard work and perseverance. 
Fucking stupid but whatever.

Australia had a gst on bit coins that hits you twice when you spend the fuckers.
