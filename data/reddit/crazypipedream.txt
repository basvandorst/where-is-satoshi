I found my withdrawal records and my account balance, the data doesn't seem fake.

I'm a noob, so sorry if this is a stupid question,  but is there a way to export my wallet seed or private keys so that I could import them in some other wallet software?

Where do you ship from?

Thanks for the answer.
Any ideea why importing the mnemonic directly into Electrum doesn't work right now? Doesn't Electrum implement the same BIP standards?

That's a great start! Congrats. However we still need exchanges to implement M of N signatures so that the users themselves are in control of the coins.

TIL not all politicians are idiots. I wish there were politicians like Mark in my country.

So the attacker managed to get out $1000 worth of coins priced at $.01/bitcoin. That's a lot of coins.

Romania experienced hyperinflation in the 1990s after the fall of the communist regime, so the ideea of a deflationary currency would likely appeal to many.
The inflation rate (annual change on consummer price index) is currently arround 3 percent, but it reached an all time high of 316.90 Percent in November of 1993 and averaged 54.26 Percent from 1991 until 2013.

People who lost their lifesavings during the 90s hyperinflation may think otherwise.

Even though they don't private keys or passwords, couldn't someone that managed to hack their site inject malicous javascript to steal your keys?

"tezaur", in Romanian.

That wasn't the point I was trying to make. I mearly wanted to point out that hyperinflation is still fresh in Romanian people's memory so they'll likely appreciate a currency/commodity with a predictable supply.
