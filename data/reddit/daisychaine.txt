They wanted to know why drops of R10k were being put into my account (mainly inactive in the past, as its only used for bitcoins and nothing else currently) for the last few months from the same unknown (bitx) bank account, I suppose it does look pretty suspicious. the last call was about a week ago during my last coin selling, i tried to explain i was selling one of my internet tokens, but seems they didnt understand what that was, after a while of explaining they seem'd okay with it.. since i haven't been called again since. They most likely tracked the Bitx account &amp; saw it was nothing to with laundering.

If someones moving from a wartorn country for a better life elsewhere id asume they are rather poor &amp; would need access to there funds (if in bitcoin) right away, for a place to live, to eat, ect. And if im not mistaken most if not all exchanges require a number of things for registration that can't be gotten very fast? thus locking them out of there funds for a while untill they have a bank account &amp; number of per-requites to register on an exchange.

no... no its not a real risk. i lived in south africa which is alot more "dangerous" than rosey america, and not once in 20 years of living there have i heard a gunshot let alone been robbed (aside from my car being broken into a number of times), the reason there are so many shootings in america is because guns are so incredibly easy to get there, along with everyone living in a constant state of fear &amp; paranoia.
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:15:02
well with USA's new toys the drones, are to said to kill 4000+ a day in the east, including civilians, might want to google it. lets not mention the arms they are selling to terrorist groups in syria, or the war in iraq.. "freedom"? gimmi a break, its an excuse to plunder oil &amp; kill.

true, but those that live in townships are generally the bottom of the barrel, getting ahold of a pc, let alone a bitcoin is near impossible, any money they do get is spent that day for living expenses such as food or pay-as-you-go electricity for a while which makes investing unappealing.

South African here, Yes bitcoins are a godsend, our corrupt goverment does any means possible to take money from us, bitcoins kinda negating that for the most part which has saved "me" alot of money &amp; with it's growth, given me alot of money. anyone that says its "evil" clearly has had a sheltered life without much financial troubles.

Hi, im not from the US but ill tell you my involvement, i have a brother that works abroad in a poor country, when i transfer money to him via banks they take 30% in tax, and it takes on average 4 weeks to transfer to him. since iv started using bitcoin it has been almost instant transfers without a middle man taking most of it, it's a godsend really.

what i generally do with bitcoins, i bought 900ish when they were going for $1 a few years ago, today i took my kitten to the vet and payed in bitcoin because carrying money around is troublesome. i got home and came to the conclusion my mouse and keyboard just werent cutting it for gaming so i bought new Razer ones online with bitcoin. My brother who currently living in new Zealand phoned me and was telling me about how he has to buy a suite for his new job and doesn't like the idea ect ect, i sent him 10 bitcoins as a gift, so he can pimp himself out. sending it took 5 seconds, it wont get taxed, the banks &amp; governments wont take a massive % of it either, he gets exactly what i gave him without the greedy middle man. im pondering what im gonna have tonight for dinner, and you better believe ill be paying in bitcoin, because its easier

if taxes exist to make our mayors house bigger, more fancy cars &amp; jet vacations to expensive places, then yes they are inherently bad &amp; ill try avoid paying them. if they were used for there intended existence then im all for it. start with using them to fix our roads, maybe use them to clean our main beaches, maybe to make our electricity stay on for more than an hour at a time, or maybe use our taxes so we can have running water all the time? but nope, having another wing on the mansion with another heated pool next to the new bmw is much better way to spend our taxes.

South African here, 1 bitcoin gets me R2000 at the moment, thats the average monthly salary, the banks here take a massive cut from salaries and any / all transactions including ATM withdrawls, literally criminal. bitcoin has made me very....very well off without having to pay the middle man.

what i love about bitcoin is that im capable of sending my brother money instantly into south africa, without the middle man taking atleast 35% of it before it eventually reaches him.. that part is truely a godsend.

wow i thought that bit was all automated as the account is basically a wallet? despite being authenticated or not, suddenly i dont feel safe keeping my coins safely tucked away on mtgox.

tell you what, the day they fix my road from the volley of potholes i'll start giving a shit about holding any ground regard to taxes. it's near impossible to drive out my house and onto the main road without hitting atleast 7 massive holes, all the while the mayor now has her 4th BMW &amp; adding extensions to her mansion. won't even mention how often the electricity is off these days, its off more than it is on, god and dont get me started on the water, why is it theres been no water for the last 3 weeks during XMAS? sure there are holiday makers from joberg here but thats hardly my problem. so when they start using taxes for what they ment to be used on, ill start caring enough to pay all of them.
