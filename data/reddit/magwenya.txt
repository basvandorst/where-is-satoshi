This is what I am thinking the plan will be for now.  When we have more time and resources to put into this, and if we are actually receiving a substantial amount of bitcoin donations, I would be interested to pursue idea of having a static bitcoin address so we can have full transparency.  For now I am going to get started setting up bitpay.  Thanks for the advice and ideas everyone.

is there any way to accept dogecoin or litecoin donations? it looks like bitpay and coinbase only accept bitcoin

Someone just tried to make a $6,000 donation! Unfortunately, we are still limited on BitPay to $100/day until they finish processing our request to take in $100,000 / day.
So, we just set up a blockchain address at 1Hkd3sv3MT9bjVpj4GPWf1NgvMHVGHXAKZ . Hopefully the donor will come back and there are more generous people like him out there! This could be a complete game changer for our organization and the children and homes we are trying to help in South Africa. If anyone else is interested in what we are doing please check out  Thank you guys so much for your help setting all this up!

I believe we are all set up with our BitPay button now at   If anyone wants to test it to make sure it works, please don't hesitate :).
Thanks again for all the help everyone, there are a lot of good ideas in here that I would like to look into more down the road.

Yes- we are a US nonprofit, but we operate in South Africa in the township of Khayelitsha outside of Cape Town.

Do you have any suggestions on where to reach out to people who may be interested in donating via bitcoin?  To give you a better idea of our cause, we are a nonprofit focused on helping orphans and vulnerable children in South Africa. More info on  if you are interested.

anyone have experience collecting donations on either of these services or have a preference between the two?

My newly launched nonprofit just started accepting bitcoin donations, so I have a few questions:
• What would be the best/easiest way to accept multiple forms of digital currency and keep track of it all?  What currencies would people recommend accepting (dogecoin, litecoin, any others?)
• Where are the best places/communities to reach out to people who may be interested in donating via digital currency?  To give some background, our nonprofit is focused on helping orphans and vulnerable children in South Africa.  We work directly with orphanages and foster homes to strengthen their operations.
• What are advantages of accepting bitcoin for a nonprofit?  I am amazed by the idea of true 100% transparency (people could donate their bitcoins to pay for a certain thing, and then we could use those actual bitcoins to buy that thing, all of which would be displayed in the public ledger), but right now a lot of our expenses take place locally in the township where bitcoin of course isn’t accepted.  Maybe there are some specific opportunities like Dell computers (one of the foster homes is trying to build a computer lab) where that could work.  Does anyone have any ideas around this or are there other implications of digital currency donations I should be thinking about?
• I’m still fairly new to digital currencies - What websites / videos / learning materials would you recommend to learn more, especially about the implications of digital currency for nonprofits?
Thanks so much in advance for your help, sorry for the many questions!
