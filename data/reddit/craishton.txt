Yes, but he said that his *work ethic* had gone down. Work ethic doesn't deal directly with behaviour, it's the belief that there's something inherently good about hard work and diligence, that it's virtuous.
I myself definitely envision a post-job future where no one has to work to live a decent life, but that doesn't mean that I wish for a future where we do not see the value of work and why you should do a good job not because you're rewarded for it, but because it's the right thing to do. In fact, I hope that it will be easier to see when it's decouples from neccesity. For example, once a week I take a one hour-ish walk during which I pick up trash. Not because I enjoy it nor because I have to, but because it's good.

Not because anything changed with the case, only because it wasn't worth the trouble and cost to keep trying to get to interogate him.


Simply untrue. Why would you even make that up?

Seems awfully convenient for you that. The real reason, of course, is that it's never happened. Quite likely is that you've confused it with the fact that she didn't want to press charges which, however, in Sweden always is up to the prosecutor, not the victim.

I mean, it says right there why it would be a problem?

Save as in the opposite of waste, not save as in what a squirrel does.

It's always fun to watch them spin around in circles when they try to explain why he went to the UK from Sweden because he apparently was afraid of extradition, with you know the UK being a much closer ally and how *both* Sweden and the UK would have had to say okay to an extradition to the US.

Come on people, can't you see that this is sarcasm?

It should be easy to provide a source then.

At lest 95% of the comments sound more ridicilous the other way round.

Yes, what could possibly be wrong with getting your information from someone who is hostile to you. I'm sure that they're just interested in "enlightening" you rather than only giving you very specific information that will serve their interests.

No he won't. He's a Putin ally running to give the illusion of competition for old Vlad.

No, and I've never said anything that would imply that. Doing it for everyone who does not isn't the right thing to do. The right thing to do is to make a reasonable effort to do good things, and to do things well when you are doing them.
In other words, there are two parts: do good things, do things well when you are doing them. The first one should be done after your ability, the second one should always be done. If you're sitting and your job not working because you've got a ton of Bitcoin so you don't really need the job anymore, that's unethical.

The dollars didn't dissapear, however there are up to around four million bitcoins that are lost forever and more being lost every day - and they're *actually* disappearing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:46:04
Everything that turns out well in the end seems like the right choice afterwards. You're delusional if you think that Bitcoin can only go up, that there's no risk involved. Overall in the world for every guy that sold too early there are at least as many who held on too long.

Yes, they can arrest you and not give you access to any manner of using them.

I prefer this quote by Charles Bartowski:

Yes? Even though it may come as a surprise to many on this subreddit, there are people who care about other things that profit - and especially short term profit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:24:00
Sounds great for society if people's ability to act without reward being the main driver is the first thing to go.

What, you mean that they don't have to design a new shirt with a different cut and/or different material for each different print?
