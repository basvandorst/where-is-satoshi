I honestly think this price decrease is everyone with extra $$$ laying around bracing for a recession in many markets.  Playing with BTC was not an investment but instead what people did with $$'s they were willing to lose.  Now, with a new recession on the horizon, people are becoming more conservative, getting out of bitcoin and into things that offer more wealth protection for uncertain times.

If people cannot sue ratings agencies for lying about the false AAA ratings that they continued to give to shitty CDO's and CPDO's, I still don't see people being able to sue crypto manipulators.  
Now, after putting my conspiracy theory hat on, I will say that the banking system has a much larger interwoven fabric of connected players who likely benefited from protection of this interwoven industry. It's entirely possible that there are less bribes and kickbacks  going around to support being shielded from prosecution of civil suits that there was in banking industry.  So, I'll concede as a possible maybe in that context.
