Bitcoin is not supposed to be reliant on miners being altruistic. No one knows when one of the hostile actor manage to gain significant amount of hashing power and started to abuse it (remember GHASH.io?)
Besides, SPV mining depends on attacker transmitting headers first which is not guaranteed.

ETC is the property of ETH holder before the fork. If you don't hold ETH in exchange before the fork you have no right to ETC. If you send ETH post fork without sending ETC the exchange shouldn't send you ETH+ETC.

I don't think people ever claim total insolvency, only ETC insolvency (which could lead to total insolvency if ETC price continues to rise).


People lose money. That's the point. Doesn't matter who. Ideally, no one should lose money in a properly executed hard fork.

Everyone is aware now that it reaches 10-20% of ETH.
I think you need to rethink what I say. Deposit ETH only, withdraw ETH+ETC. Free money. Is that how it's supposed to work?


So if you put Bitcoin into exchange you can't withdraw your own Bitcoin? 


Yes, in a stock split you can sue your broker if they don't give you access to other split.


How does that even work when all other exchange are already listing ETC. 


They are mad because the ETC is rightfully theirs.

Have you ever heard of quadratic hashing? Miner can gain advantage over other miner by spamming cheap transaction that takes a long time to verify. Classic works around this by introducing limit on # of bytes/transaction. The reason why Unlimited forks off of Classic is because they didn't implement this limit. 
But you don't like limits right? I mean what if this limit hinders smart contract functionality? That's why Core implements Segwit first. It is so that we can limit # of bytes/tx without hindering the script. This is the kind of long term planning that we need.

I think PoS has other vices that is seldom discussed:
1. As can be seen from NXT, Vericoin, and latest Ethereum hack obtaining a large amount of coin can be pretty trivial. Obtaining a large amount of hashpower is not so trivial.
2. I personally find the balance of power between developer, mining power, and economic power is quite beautiful. It forms Montesquieu's tripartite system of legislative, executive, and judicative. Had Bitcoin been under PoS I suspect there would be much more chaos. Right now mining power provides balance between the developer and exchange/payment service. Of course it doesn't stop economic power from acquiring mining service a la BTCC but normally the skillset doesn't intersect.
3. I believe in cooperative model like Casper there is higher tendency to form cartel than in PoW
With combination of (2) and (3) I'm not sure how consensus formed with PoS would be better than traditional financial system.

I was going to ask you to read the description on asymmetric and symmetric two-way peg but then I read this on Federated peg part:

Headers first doesn't work well when the block rewards goes down. Not to mention when doing headers-first you can't add your own transaction so what's the point of producing a block?
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:44:39
Two way pegged sidechain requires Bitcoin's miner to verify sidechain's block header. Currently Bitcoin doesn't have this capability. Federated sidechain use multisig as a replacement to that so instead of trusting the miner you are trusting the multisig holder instead.
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:17:05
This is why sometime people just doesn't have knack of thinking adversarially (please note that I am not making an insult of you sometimes I am also not very good at it). Let's say someone send exchange ETH only (e.g from mining reward or by properly splitting post fork) and then this particular someone withdraw the ETH from exchange and the exchange send them ETH+ETC. This person has no right of the ETC. It is the property of whoever is holding ETH in the exchange prior to fork.

Does not compute


And by mining headers first you make the DoS block much deeper. When initially only 1 miner needs to orphan the block now you need two miners instead.

Unfortunately most miners is not qualified to do so, as can be seen in testnet fork.


So how exactly do you propose to address quadratic hashing? Choose to mine your own block if it spent too long verifying a block? You still waste time (depending on your timeout period) doing that. Not to mention risk of causing re-org chaos.

MAST only works because Bitcoin script is stateless. Implementing MAST on stateful chain is not so straightforward.

The idea is that they should contribute to the effort by committing to it, and not just simply wait for other people to release it before using it.

But they CAN. Inclusiveness is an important feature. I would say that if that if there is no ASIC miner-vote is good since everyone can use their CPU to vote but currently this is not the situation


Too much power. The incumbents has the incentive to keep the block size low to get better price even though the economic activity has gone up. Smaller miner with better margin that wants to alleviate the situation by producing bigger blocks will not be able to do so. It is important to share the power between economic and hash rate power holder.
Also see the inclusiveness part above.


Once implemented we will have adaptable limit. No more need to fork (hard/soft) for any kind of circumstances.


The variable is an important security variable. In the long term I believe a hard-coded limit needs to go so that we don't need to fork anymore.

These custodians can provide a way to prove that they vote according to their 'constituents' (they can hold internal 'election' if they want), the method is quite similar to proof-of-solvency. If people don't like them they can move their coins during the next voting period.


They already can determine soft limit, asking them to determine hard limit is a little bit reckless.


It is generally hard to count the number of node operators that is resistant to sybil, that is why we need PoW in the first place. Node operators can vote, provided that they hold Bitcoins. 


idea below is also quite interesting.
All in all, I believe the complexity of these kind of solutions will probably prevent us from deploying them during the near crunch.

@_date: 2015-06-12 21:07:03


Uh, no. If your node says the block is invalid you will reject every transaction in it (even if it might causes you to be in a fork). If a significant number of full node says a block is invalid the miners won't get their revenue. Some fullnode (e.g exchange's, Coinbase, Bitpay's) are more important than the other though.
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:37:30
jdillon's idea is excluded vote is counted as status-quo so the miner won't gain anything by excluding it (unless of course they are for-status-quo, but that doesn't change much from current condition).
@_date: 2015-06-13 00:38:29
Perhaps I'm not getting myself clear. People vote weighted by UTXO. Of course miner can vote. But unless they have a significant amount of Bitcoin their vote won't matter. This is the proposal I'm talking about:
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:14:30


What kind of usage are we talking about? I'm using libbitcoin fullnode as a replacement for Bitcoin Core and I'm pretty happy about it (sync time is horrible though, because no header-first).
Edit: Seems like Coinkite is also pretty happy about it.
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:21:58


I think it is much fairer to give power based on economic size than hash power. Which is why I'd rather have jdillon's pos (petertodd's favorite) in voting for block size. The downside is complexity. If you favor simplicity 20mb is better because full node can still chose what they want (of course in the it will still be determined by economic size with coinbase/exchange/bitpay leading the pack).

If you look at my post I'm actually pro-20mb increase :). It's just that I want to remind other extreme pro-20mbers that we are losing something in the process. A 3-way split of hashing power is not something that we want.
Edit: Just to further clarify I'm pro-20mb but I'm against BIP100 solely because it took the power of full node away and give it to the miner.

If you know how to code you can read isStandard() function in Bitcoin source code (I am not really familiar with that) and see which input is failing the test.


Well, it doesn't hurt to try. You will need to use non-bc.i wallet though as they already see the transaction (import privkey from bc.i) .

The answer is some people do buy and sell coins for profits and not simply for expanding the economy. The first question to answer is where do the person selling bitcoin at localbitcoins.com get their bitcoin in the first place? For the kind of volume you regularly see at localbitcoins.com it is unlikely that they get their coin from the miner. So it is more likely that they get their bitcoin from exchanges like the one mentioned by OP. To gain profit they will need to mark up the price. 
As for being greedy if there is demand there will always be supply.

It actually does make sense. It makes sure that every data point in the chart represent 24 hour period. The first data point in your chart would represent less than 24 hours because technically Bitcoin has not been invented prior to that so it's not apple-to-apple comparison between 1st 24hours and 2nd 24 hours.

The thing is hash-rate/dollar is not constant. As technology nodes advance that value tends to go up. So 1 petahash now is not equivalent to 1 petahash say 1 year from now. 
Like said it is more important to look at the cost (rather than hash rate value). 
If you want to see the current cost to do 51% you can refer to  
However that website made the assumption that the attacker is a rational actor (e.g. want to maximize profit) so they include lost opportunity cost that the attacker could make when they support the network instead of attacking it. If the attacker has other motivation the cost would simply be the cost needed to secure 51% hash rate.

Hmmm... It's actually quite complex. You will need another tool for this. I've been browsing around Blockchain.info for a while but can't seem to find one. Are you in a rush? If not just let it simmer for a few days/weeks before the transaction finally expired or bc.i staff take a look.
Otherwise you can probably try to 'sweep' the key to another Wallet like Electrum (Warning! I'm not responsible for any loss). Download Electrum, Login to your bc.i account, Go to Import/Export, choose Export, Select Bitcoin-QT Format, copy the 'priv' field (the one that starts with 5...), In electrum choose import, paste the private key, sweep/transfer it, and transfer it back to your bc.i address (optional, if bc.i is more convenient for you)

May I know how do you confirm that it is the 0.0047BTC that causes it failing to confirm? Actually the problem is one/multiple of the input is non-standard rather than unconfirmed (as my libbitcoin node accept it just fine). The problem is as far as I know only Eligius mine on non-standard transaction and they hate dice site (political reason, they think those sites bloat the blockchain). 
If you are sure that it is that particular input that causes it failing to confirm you can exclude them by creating raw transaction.

Blockchain pruning is not exactly 'silver bullet'. There is difficulty associated with bootstrapping new node if everyone is holding only the pruned blockchain (it's quite hard to verify which one is the longest chain). While it is quite easy to implement checkpoint it will lead to centralization (Bitcoin is meant to be trustless).
With sipa's latest block-header first it might be possible to hold partial blockchain but it is actually a lot of hard work to implement that.

I am still quite new to this so if someone more know than I do can tell that I'm wrong please correct me. The multisig method that you described is a 'user-friendly' one. The sender only needs to send bitcoin to the multisig address (starts with 3). This can be done from most wallet. The transaction that you link is another way of doing multisig. But unlike the 'user-friendly' version it needs to be handcrafted using raw transaction. You can check  and compare it to the input/output scripts (Show Scripts &amp; Coinbase in Blockchain.info).

The problem is the current "block space" definition doesn't actually fit the true cost of processing transaction. In terms of "block space" it might be more expensive but if you define it in terms of "block weight" it's actually not.


I'm not really sure where you are getting your definition of technical debt from. This is Wikipedia's definition:


Which is the very definition of what you do in block size increase. It requires you for example, to deal with UTXO growth later on when there is no solution at hand yet. 
It also requires you to limit the size of transaction to deal with quadratic hashing. This will disable a large scale coinjoin later on for example, even though a subset of the transaction (e.g segwit-style transaction) is not affected by quadratic hashing. You also may be attacked when HF is not happening yet (e.g people producing &gt;100kb tx while HF is not yet affected) so to avoid that you will need to handle another edge case.
The worst part is wallet/services will still also need to handle replay protection anyway.

At the same time?(unlikely) Now everyone using EB1/AD6 would be at risk. So a default setting now may no longer be secure a year from now. During transition what default value do you offer? EB1/AD6 or EB2/AD6? How do you tell them how many conf is secure? The concern is not on people who knows what they're doing but rather those who do not.

Nope, Electrum employs Bloom Filter. Invertible Bloom Filter is the one being used to eliminate the needs for full node to download whole block everytime miner find a new block by 'guessing' which transaction is inside the block based on block headers and transaction that are already inside the mempool. This feature is not yet implemented in Bitcoin Core.


Nope, rather than querying the balances SPV clients query transaction. Think of it this way. The way Bitcoin works is that everytime you receive a payment you receive single 'dollar bill' with 'serial number' attached to it. When you make a payment you need to refer to this 'serial number'. If you don't store the whole blockchain you may not know what is the 'serial number' of the 'dollar bills' that you have.
What the Bloom filter does is that it attempt to ask the Electrum server to pass only the transaction with serial number that is relevant to you. Of course you will need to pass some of the 'fake' request as well to attempt to protect your privacy (which the Bloom filter also provides).
You can refer to BIP37 by Mike Hearn for more details:

Compliance with regulation is the least thing we have to worry. With quadratic hashing (1) someone could disrupt Bitcoin operation for days. 
With UTXO bloat attack (2) someone could prevent any home-based personal computer from running full node ever again (note: Gavin didn't consider worst case scenario there). Even with current block size UTXO **grows** faster than technology. So you can expect the number of nodes to continue to drop **even at current block size**.
We haven't even talked about Sybil. During Bitcoin Classic debacle it has been shown that it is possible to spoof 1/12th of Bitcoin node. So at 1/12th of our current node ratio it is possible that 50% of Bitcoin node are fake. Now it is really easy to triangulate the origin of a transaction and to run eclipse attack.
(3) and (4) isn't even about node centralization but rather about miner centralization. Now I'm not even sure you actually read through them.

You can't get roadmap if everyone is working on different things. That's what it means to be decentralized. Even Core roadmap above is obtained after bloods, sweat and tears. People seems to underestimate the difficulty of gaining consensus. 
I'd rather have a split chain than negotiating further. The truth is any further blocksize increase can only be made after Segwit is online. Without studying the behaviour of the network at larger block it is impossible to deem whether further increase is possible (or even if it is necessary)


Repeat after me. Decentralization caused immutability. Immutability is feature, not a bug.

I think that's because they only consider block propagation time, which is alleviated with compact block, right? So I don't think the 4MB figure is still valid. I agree with the rest of your point though compact block just move the bottleneck elsewhere. I was hoping for Johnson Lau's block weight counting to achieve consensus but seeing how much opposition the current SegWit's block weight has I doubt it will have enough support.




Your time to shine Greg :P
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:34:46
Compact block breaks down when there's large difference in miner's mempool. Weak block/mempool sync is a class of solution called pre-consensus where there is communication between miner to sync their mempool before block is finally made
See also Byzcoin and Bitcoin-NG


But it address the concern of growing UTXO, which can address some of the objection regarding increasing block size. 


People need to realize that apart from bandwidth all other aspects of silicon-based technology has slowed down. When that happen it is entirely possible that there will be no more blocksize increase.

Bitcoin transaction consist of 3 major parts: inputs, signature, output. Output is the smallest part of the transaction and yet it requires permanent storage (preferably in memory, especially at sync time). A typical 1 input 2 outputs transaction has 226 bytes. Each output only consist of 20 bytes but responsible for majority of storage. This is the reason why counting fee/kb is broken. An attacker could easily bloat the entire block with UTXO, leading to increased requirement on running a full node **permanently** (this is unlike quadratic hashing where the effects is temporary)


Because you need to be ready when the technology hits the ceiling.


UTXO grows by 60% last year. This is **without** attack (attack is very expensive when the block is full)
HDD price decrease by 10-20%. 
Memory price actually increase last year
All pointing that UTXO is growing faster than the technology. People don't make noise without good reason. It is getting more expensive to run a node.
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:05:59




You're assuming that block propagation is still an issue, which it isn't. At least not at current block size after xthin/compact block. With malleability and quadratic hashing fix 11% is a really small price to pay.


Relatively harmless compared to UTXO bloat. Witness does not need to be cached, permanent storage can be sharded unlike UTXO. As of now UTXO grows faster than technological growth **even at current blocksize**.

I think that's a little bit flawed. By reducing block rate you will still roughly get the roughly same amount of security in same amount of time (e.g  1 1 minute block confirmation is equal to 1/10th 1 10 minute). I think Meni Rosenfeld argues that it is not exactly linear like that but I don't think you can get to the point where 1 minute block confirmation has same amount of security to 10 minutes. In the case of a car I don't think you should wait 10 minutes in the case of 1 minute block as has tested and it is possible to have 10 blocks reorg.

1. You think they can't score point when they show that they are both competent and provides all both sides need? (or at least make it optional, just like they did block size). By not supporting SegWit they breach their own "Be conservative in what you create" mantra, making them look both like hypocrite.

What do they want? Because plain 2MB is not feasible. All the technical problems were explained. SegWit is the best we have. Luckily Bitpay and Coinbase already change their mind.

[I talk]( Segwit comes as a result. Not sure what is the problem there.


Because it can't. If Steve Jobs tell his engineer, hey I want you guys to work on phone that can has neural input, just need to think what button to press and it will press it for you any reasonably sane engineer would tell him, "I'm sorry Steve, that is just not possible". But maybe I can use eye tracking instead.
Similarly if someone wants to produce an mm-sized design rule IC using only transparency and a marker any reasonably sane engineer would tell I don't think you can do that. If you attempt to do that you will just produce scrap. But I probably can use lens to project the original image.

Let me break it down for you


It allows miner to create blocks within 10 minutes period that has difficulty less than global difficulty. This allows miner to more or less know what other miner has inside the mempool. Gun Sirer's Bitcoin NG is one implementation of weak block (although Greg's implementation significantly differs from his). The current compact block/xthin breaks down if miner has significantly different transactions inside their mempool (which is possible since transaction doesn't propagate uniformly at higher tps).


Allows multiple people to combine their transactions into one (or single person combine their multiple inputs together) without penalty on processing (single verification). This will allow roughly [additional 30% capacity]( even without increasing blocksize limit.


You need to read the bottom part of the link.


This way we can ensure that compact block remains effective even at higher tps.


More tps without significant penalty on decentralization.
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:24:12


If only we have a way to measure the effectiveness of xthin and compact blocks at bigger blocksize in the real world to determine appropriate action. Oh wait! We do!

Ethereum might have dynamic blocksize limit but it was saved by changing one out of 255 magic numbers. Do you know you still have a lot of magic number inside Bitcoin? Why don't you make emergent consensus on push size? Or script size? Why only block size?


With multiple hard fork you will need 2n line patches, and not only 2 line patch.


You need to be around to avoid downtime or getting attacked. What could go wrong^TM ?


You can't receive payment until the chain is doomed or you're risking accepting payment on doomed chain. You're wrong if you think miner has 0 incentive to extend doomed chain, especially when transaction fee goes to zero.


Where do you get 99%? You still have on-chain, Lightning, and sidechain. Even if Bitcoin's entire transaction fee replaces the current block reward it is still cheaper than a SWIFT transfer. And like I said you don't need to onboard 99% at the same time. You can't build anything if your only tool is a hammer.

Well the problem is no matter how long you study this you will never be 100% certain. There needs to be a cutoff. It is easier to prove that the limit is unsafe rather than the limit is safe.


You think Lightning Network is a 'business'? No, the creation of Lightning Network will help to ensure that Bitcoin remains decentralized. The problem is that it is not yet ready.


There is no guarantee that the core-devs (not that each core-devs might have their own) version will be the main version.


Everyone may agree, but I don't think they will be happy. I believe  a good solution is the one where everyone is equally unhappy (the one where everyone is equally happy is just impossible). I think you are being too much of an idealist here. There are cases where there is no 'good question' and 'good answer' available.


With adaptable block size miners are winners, full nodes are losers. With 20MB Block size whoever wants the network to grows wins, Strawpay, pro-decentralization loses. I just don't think such solutions would exist.


You could argue that Gavin is not crystal balling 20MB limit. He has done all the study he can to prove that it is safe (running testnet).


Well there are 'easy decisions' and there are 'hard ones'. Unfortunately block size is one of the 'hard ones'. As for your Peter Todd example I can provide one counterpoint: replace-by-fee.

The fear is not irrational. At 1MB block size miners who were not mining with Ghash.io is not as profitable (which were then fixed with relay network).
Study shows that 4MB is what we can achieve without centralizing miner the way it did with Ghash.io. 
SegWit gives half of that capacity because we also need to address concern for UTXO growth. Why do you want to hard fork to 2x capacity when Lightning can potentially give you much more than that?

And they will end up looking like PayPal. With miners controlling the blockchain.


If the technology improves 10000x overnight I don't mind having 1000x increased capacity (provided the incentive is balanced) but it's not. Even then there is a gap that Bitcoin can't fulfill (e.g 0-conf will never be secure, sub-satoshi payment is not possible without forking)

Means you don't understand UTXO growth concern on why only Witness part can be increased. It's like arguing with Vitalik on how to avoid Ethereum being DoSed. The reason we haven't been DoSed like Ethereum is because of block size limit. SegWit increase the block size without worrying about being DoSed. And now you guys just think that because it doesn't happen it will never happen.
There will be no blocksize increase **ever**. Only block weight adjustment. Segwit is first step.
And he doesn't say anything about multiple hard fork only singular, which is my point. And BU doesn't even bother to follow his solution.

EB=1MB makes up the minority of the node, which means nobody follows your Best Known Method, which clearly support my point that most of BU supporters is clueless and doesn't agree with your definition of "Schelling Point".


The amount of merchant adoption shows how many people are willing to take that risk.


Fine, at least sets a clear transition on where to start to switch to bigger block and not a subjective number that anyone can decide, because most people have no idea what to set without jeopardizing their day-to-day.


Are you saying all 7 Billion people all currently use SWIFT with USD? No. Some people don't. There are other class of solutions that support other use cases, like Coinbase-offchain. 
Besides, some of those people will not on-board at the same time. We already have 8 years of Bitcoin, which is 1/10th of your estimate.


And my point is that people that support BU is clueless about a good Schelling Point and a good solutions for the network.

Everything else except bandwidth is slowing down.

1. What you use it for may be in conflict with my interest.
2. If you haven't figured out what Bitcoin is capable of now you haven't done enough research.


Ever tried using gold to transfer $1 milion dollars overseas? Ever tried to use gold to bypass capital restriction? Ever tried to use gold to avoid your wealth being confiscated? Yeah, figures. Just because Bitcoin is not useful to you because you can't purchase coffee doesn't mean it is no longer useful for many people.






What makes you think Bitcoin any less probable than fiat or gold to exchange for useful things in the future? There is only a limit before you sound like a buttcoiner you know?
We haven't even considered the fact that Lightning can fulfill all of your use case.


Uh, no. You know how many tps does an exchange support? You don't use SWIFT/FedWire for normal transfer, do you?


Can you please stop straw manning block size limit argument? You can start by researching on block propagation and UTXO growth. You can't run Bitcoin Core on rasp pi without waiting for weeks/months and most block propagation research uses DSL as standard. Upload limit is more important than download for the case of Bitcoin.


Just goes to show you don't know how much people spend for remittance. Normal WU transfer costs ~8%. When the amount goes up costs also goes up. In comparison if we replace entire block reward with transaction fee it will only cost ~2.5$ flat.

Accept lists of transactions offchain(example: BTCC). Mine transaction without broadcasting them. Other miners will be forced to re-validate the entire block because they don't have the transaction. This will cause a penalty in their mining time. Defense: block size limit.
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:25:18
ETC fork is also supported with overwhelming majority of hashrate (and economic power). Yet it still survive. Chandler Guo initially attempt to attack ETC and now he is one of its biggest supporter, which is freaking hilarious. The truth is 51% attack is the stupidest way to attack a coin. It shows the lack of creativity shown in majority of BU supporter. When you attempt to 51% attack a coin, you end up with the coin itself and with an actual demand of course there is a huge temptation to support that coin itself. It took an economically irrational person to do 51% attack.
Now take a look at the amount of money itself. $100Million dollars seems big but it is actually small. It took only 100,000 people to spend $1,000 to outdo you. I would be surprised if I can't find 100,000 radical Core supporter not worrying about mining at a loss. Of course we haven't taken into account botnet operators, rogue employee at supercomputing facilities, and altcoin miners. In the end when $100M is gone the chain will proceed as per normal, leading increased value in coin. This kind of shortsightedness seems to be the hallmark of BU supporter.
Lastly, isn't this the same BTC.TOP that "accidentally" mines SegWit block just a couple of days ago? Makes you really wonder if this is the same case of closet gays hating an openly gay people.

No, but if miner wants to print more than 21M or confiscate coin then they **need** to. I'd accept no less from people who wants to adopt Bitcoin.

At the end of the day, it comes down to one question. Is the benefit worth it? 
To me the answer seems simple. NO. You are not gaining extra capacity for example, or adding extra features. Not to mention that if we have fraud proof or UTXO commitment in the future for example we will need to rearrange the structure in the block header again. Might as well do everything in one shot.

People with superior engineering talent doesn't just decide the block space is scarce willy-nilly. They used scientific method to determine the risk of increasing the block size. That's how a lot of people comes to the same conclusion. Even then they still listen to the demand of the market. SegWit is the solution that they come about.
Anyone disagreeing that L2 is not a viable solutions like that "long time bitcoiner" above is a typical example of anti-intellectual proponent (e.g I am stupid and I am proud of it).
Take a look at routing problems in PCB/semiconductor. It is a simple problem of drawing two lines as close as possible without intersecting. When you have large circuit all you need is a marker and a transparency sheet. When you go to mm-sized line you will need to start to use a lens to project the original. At nanometre size you will need hundred million dollar tools with 50+ lens with special substrate with special photo-resist on top of magnetically levitated stage. In other words, you need multiple layers of solutions on top of each other. 
Now what BU proposing is let's make mm-sized line consistently without intersecting using only marker and transparency sheet. "I have a steady hand". Guess what, not even a year and they already short the circuit.

1. That separate serialization will be useful when you want to attempt to add additional feature to bootstrap a new node without signatures. (less security than the current full node bootstrap but arguably optionality is always useful)
2. SW-HF will require longer block header, which means disruption to entire ecosystem and bigger SPV proof (although you can argue it makes it looks less hack-ish than with the current root-in-Coinbase setup, however you will also need to remember that [fast-inverse-square-root]( also look hack-ish but it works beautifully so now the question is if it is really worth it to change the location)

Well to do this, you need to make an assumption about usage. For example is 20MB Block going to be open to an abuse? Can we support higher than 3 tps without hickup? How long before we reach there? Do we need to take action now? 


I think if you are talking about miner alone you are giving too much power to the miner. The way things are done now is full node operators + miner decide the way.


Can you give link to sourceforge/narkive site? I'm skeptical of the presence of such panacea solutions.


Well in the case of Bitcoin, this group consist of full node operators + miner. Which is as democratic as it can be since this group consist of everyone. Which is why it is important that everyone can run a fullnode while supporting a higher number of tps.

1. There is no incentive for miner to keep 21M limit.
2. Miner now can serve as regulatory point where now they require registration for SPV that is attached to them
3. Miner can freely confiscate coin whenever they want.

@_date: 2015-05-09 03:02:57


Yes this has been proposed before. The full-node now have no control over the block size limit and all the powers are handed over to miner because miners are free to increase blocksize at their own pace instead of full node's.


If we can do this without a fork we would have done so unfortunately the way block size is determined it would be impossible to do so.


Is it possible to exploit weakness in 20MB block? No one knows for sure. It is like trying to prove that you don't own any Bitcoin. Some people like more time to study, some people like to do it in reasonable amount of time. This is hardly a technical decision.


Some people would beg to differ. Their reasoning is that blocksize limit is good to force technical innovation like Lightning Network. Again how you view this would depend on your vision of how you want Bitcoin to be.


I wouldn't count on that. Some people are highly opinionated. Mircea Popescu has already declared he won't agree to 20MB Block. Me myself won't agree to 1MB Block without any gameplan.

If this is your only metrics is right Bitcoin-core would run best with extremely small blocks. But remember, you also need to consider how many transactions per second you want to support. 
Tradeoffs are everywhere and everyone has their own opinions. You can't avoid from getting political if you talk about money.
Edit: Fortunately Core Devs won't be central bankers. The way Bitcoin works is that full node operators and miners will choose which chain they like (although a fork is ugly, probably there will be some sort of vote a la BIP16 style if it comes down to it).

The alternative (current situation) is people bloating UTXO, which is far more dangerous than people bloating witness.

The question is whether the user has the understanding of the implication to exercise that power. To give an example. During the last bitcoin.com SNAFU 75% of BU nodes has an estimated convergence time in 40 minutes while 25% of BU node has estimated convergence time in 19 years. This shows that majority of BU node
1. Doesn't actually use that to verify payment.
2. Doesn't have understanding of what that power entails.


You are ignoring the possibility of bitcoin.com-like snafu, or even a malicious actor(like miner lying on their EB/AD setting).


It **is** incompatible. BIP100 guarantee convergence at nearly the same level at current 1MB limit. It is entirely possible that some BU miners are asleep when BIP100 miners decide to increase the limit beyond their EB.


Off-chain consensus mechanism is still better than how BU works. If you want to do off-chain, do fully off-chain, if you want to do on-chain, do it fully on-chain. BU can't seems to decide which want they want.

Actually that is one of the hardest part of Segwit. It is designed with this as one of the feature. I doubt anything else that doesn't consider this at the very beginning is viable as an alternative.


You will feel it when you have features that requires big signature, like Lamport (which is required for quantum-computing resistant) or CT (which is required to mask the amount for better fungibility).


I think you are mistaking something. SPV node can't validate the blockchain. The signatureless IBD is only used during IBD. After IBD is done the security is the same as full-node.

1. I'm just arguing against your idea of "node counts" as a success. No, it is not a success when the reason of increased node count is not because of innovation but because of politics. Are they making any performance increase that can be merged back into Core? No.
2. It's a problem when they're pushing crap code as being safe. I don't have any issue with everyone working on their own private repo (at least if they using Core's codebase). It will be merged if it is good enough.

The thing is, 20mb limit is buying time kind of solution. If we don't kick the can far enough there is not enough time to solve the scalability issue and we will be having this kind of debate again in a few years time. By that time the number off full nodes has already increased by far more and it will be much more difficult to coordinate the effort.


The limit is a couple years old. Satoshi himself thinks that this will be eventually changed.
Lastly, here's my question to you: if not 20mb what is a good block-size to you? If you choose to endure the limit (hit the 1mb), how long do we need to 'suffer'?

That's why SF is preferrable. The way I see it bitcoin can only take at most 1 more HF before it is frozen forever. A lot of people actually like immutability.


And now how are you going to set the AD? That will prevent you from accepting low-conf tx, just like what happen during bitcoin.com snafu. Customer will be complaining that they will see their tx in the blockchain but your node is not seeing that.


So until you realize that you need to change AD or EB you can't accept any tx. Customers will be angry. 
We haven't even consider the possibility of miners engaging in predatory behavior (purposely tricked other miner/merchant to extend the wrong chain).


And it appears from bitcoin.com incident BU's stakeholders doesn't understand what its software entails. If even they can't understand it who do you think are going to educate other people? Even most merchant understand the risk enough not to use it in production. 
Me, myself who spent quite sometime understanding consensus system can't tell the correct EB/AD setting for any particular use case. There are just too many variables.

Bandwidth perspective:


I disagree with him though. Nielsen's law say the growth is 50%, so even then we still end up with slightly less than 1MB.
Beside, I got a little bit something of my own here. This is what causes baseline sync time will drift further and further, UTXO growth:
UTXO grows 60% last year. [Sergio says HDD storage grows by 40%]( Edit: Looks like he was basing that on Kryder's law though, that is a prediction made in 2005, from the chart we can see we have experienced slow down since then.

You are forgetting something. Just because there is a 20x change in Block size limit doesn't mean that suddenly everything will be 20x higher. The change will still be relatively gradual as the userbase of Bitcoin expands and you still can catch up as the technology advance (which is what the blocksize increase is counting on, not pretty but that's what we have).
So why do we need to increase the blocksize now if the limit is not yet reached?
Because it will be harder down the road. A hard fork requires everyone to change once we started seeing 1MB Block. As bitcoin usage grows, the number of full nodes that needs upgrade will increase and in which case it will be harder to coordinate.


That's assuming Block is full all the time, which is not true at all. Even now the maximum block size reached is only around 0.5MB (and is very seldom seen). The thing is we can't tell when we will first start seeing 1MB Block. Better to get prepared rather than getting caught off guard.

Well, to be fair Satoshi made the same mistake of assuming that the technology will overcome everything. 


(Bonus irony point from the same thread: Gavin being reasonable
If I have to guess where Satoshi went wrong, these are the two words I will use
**Thermal Ceiling**
Satoshi, having lived most of his live in 80s-90s experiences scaling in both **speed and capacity**. As you made the circuit smaller you can get scaling in both transistor density and clock speed. That's how you go from KHz-MHz-GHz. The problem is as you increase clock speed you dissipate more heat and at certain stage you reach the stage where heat transfer in Silicon can't help you anymore. That's why CPU clock speed and memory throughput stuck where they are. Interestingly HDD tech experience the same thing, capacity increase with better media but r/w throughput hit the limit with mechanical performance being the bottleneck.
Of course you can be clever with parallelism (e.g pipelining, branch prediction in CPU) but it just simply can't be compared with raw speed scaling because by being clever you will introduce overhead somewhere.
Imagine if we actually have 1000x increase in those parameter (memory/HDD throughput, CPU clock speed) I think we won't need to worry as much about let's say about UTXO growth (core-devs can verify this?) because the bottleneck is now in bandwidth and bandwidth scaling is relatively straightforward.

The main problem with HF is that it leads to centralized decision making. I mean sure, Core devs can just say one year from now there is a hard fork. But that means that Bitcoin is no longer decentralized because now Core now takes leadership position, something that they refused to do (for the right reason too). This is in contrast with Ethereum for example, where all the decision making is done by Ethereum Foundation. Sure, it is easier to do hard fork but as a result it is no longer decentralized. I would say the end result is pretty bad with not enough external party scrutinizing the source code. Now all the responsibility of reviewing lies with the Foundation (for geth/solidity).
One of the main problem with decentralized system is the difficulty of making major decision (which, in turns give rise to advantage in immutability). For example, with SegWit Core devs didn't just say "Let's do SegWit!". They did seek feedback from lightning dev, joinmarket dev, wallet dev, exchanges, node operator etc. Only when all the major stakeholders green-light them does the "Core Roadmap" written.
Even then currently there isn't enough support from the miners.

Yes, so long as we have consensus and provided that there is a long lead time there's nothing to fear. But it is really hard to sell a hard fork when all it offers is "increase block size". The hardfork wish list itself is quite long:

Here's what I think a better analogy. I worked in semicon. When you reach certain feature size 193nm litho tool will stop working so you need to upgrade to 193-i. People can't just complain that 193 can still do the job. No, it can't (at least not with acceptable scrap rate). That is just plain physics. You can't complain that "we don't have 193-i tool yet. The lead time is too long", etc.

Assuming no one abused the system. Take a look at the Ethereum's chart below.
There's a bump in September-October and November where an attacker run DoS (miner then run temporary soft fork to limit "block size"). The DoS was bad enough to make Ethereum's economy comes to a grinding halt.
To fix that in the end they need to break immutability.
The reason block was not full was because there was less incentive to attack it. Now with 10billion dollars market cap and multiple competing cryptos there are more reasons to run DoS

Of course you can. You just need to trust miner not to confiscate coin. This is still more secure than SPV, at least you still can verify 21M BTC limit. And it is still more secure than Ethereum's endgame, which is trust-your-friend-to-get-you-latest-UTXO. 
If we want to get people to run full node there will be some trade-off.
Finally like I said, you still can bootstrap the old way but you don't need to if you don't want to. Optionality.

Where did I imply that? I only compare SWSF vs SWHF.


And you're forcing all the devs who might be working on other things to work on the HF. I mean if you want a centralized decision making it is fine but that's not how Bitcoin works. Core devs have repeatedly made clear that they don't intend to position themselves as a leader. 
Good think about SF is that it is optional. If people don't like it they can just leave it alone without splitting the chain.

The risk is unknown. It is highly dependent on people knowing what is the correct EB/AD/ depending on miner's setting. Unless you're expecting everyone to run a simulation every time miner change EB/AD. For example during transition to 2MB what is your EB/AD recommendation and what is your suggested  If you straight away put 2 you will be at risk of someone creating a single 2MB block and someone building on top of their blocks. If you put at 1 you are at risk of being left behind. Now you can't process automatic transaction without watching the network like a hawk. People are not all computer engineer, running simulations.

Well has it tested (although with 24 seconds block), see below:


Like I said to get 1 hour security you will need to wait 1 hour regardless of block rate. Personally I don't think 2 blocks (@ 10 minute block rate) is enough for car purchase, I certainly would wait for 6 blocks if I sell a car. Like mentioned below the only use case for higher block rate is for micropayment where only 1 block confirmation is required(current Bitcoin has problem with this because sometime block can be found in 1 minute at one time and the 1 hour the other), in which case there is other suitable solution, like micropayment channels.

trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Motivation is what you meant to achieve. Here is the motivation part of the white paper.


minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. 
Note that the motivation is **not** always achieved. This is the reason why so many pop-science magazine always say so-and-so scientist manages to cure cancer while what actually happens is that they **pave** the way to it.

I've seen this argument used a couple of time to defend the PoS but I have problem accepting it. I think that when we are discussing wealth inequality it is not ratio that matters. But rather it is the difference is what actually matters.
Let me give you an example. Person A owns USD 1 million. Person B owns USD 10K. Let's say mining pays out ~1% of your total worth every year(very highly simplified version of PoS). Person A will get USD10K a year just by doing nothing (well technically he needs to run a PC but once it is setup everything is done). That is the total amount of worth of Person B. Meanwhile person B is (probably) struggling with all the bills, Person A obtains his total net worth just simply by owning coins. Is that really fair? I don't think so...
Compare that to PoW mining. Miner is actually doing work. They need to maintain their equipment, keeping the equipment upgraded, ensure the uptime, fending off all the DDoS etc... Do they earn their share? I'd say yes...

No, there is another reason, which is I could trick a certain person from accepting payment on one chain that I know for certain will be orphaned.

I'm a supporter of 20MB Block but I'm also a believer of 'not everything needs to be in Blockchain. Here's reason why I believe 1 minute block is not as relevant as 20MB block:
1. The change is more dangerous because it will take effect immediately. 20MB Block won't take effect until we started seeing Block bigger than 1MB. Even then the change will be gradual.
2. You will change the network usage so that latency will matter more than Bandwidth. This will probably push miner to be more geographically concentrated.
3. Unlike blocksize increase there's no pressure from Bitcoin usage. This is a change just for convenience sake.
4. There's not enough study on the increase of orphan rate (which means more wasted effort from hashing). Ethereum can support less block time because they allow 'uncles' so they create less orphan. We don't have such a thing for Bitcoin.

2. Life feels boring doing the same thing over and over, probably it's worth doing a new venture. If they fail, well their fortune is now more distributed, if they are successful they probably have contributed to the society.
If someone actually manage to pull something like living like a monk while being filthy rich, well I'd say fair is fair. They probably deserve to get richer for being financially responsible.


Unlike a house, you can buy a fraction of Bitcoin. You don't need to involve any debt in having some bitcoin (well you could but there's no point if you're only trying to store your wealth). If suddenly Bitcoin crash it won't create a devastating chain reaction like what happen during last financial crisis. I'd say it is much healthier this way.

Bitcoin can operate without third party, however it doesn't mean that third party cannot enter. Consider a company that provides 2-of-2 multisig wallet (one key held by customer and the other held by the company), but only broadcast the tx 1 month after the customer sign the tx (nLockTime can be used by the customer to ensure this). If the user actually dispute the transaction within 1 month the tx is not broadcasted. And suddenly, you have a debit card company that can provides chargeback.
As for credit side, personally I am not a big fan of the concept of debt. There is actually an alternative financial system that is not debt-based, like Islamic Banking:

If I learn anything from KSP it is that the thing about rocket is the first stage is the one who will do most of the heavy lifting because
1. You are too close to the planet that the gravity is still very big.
2. You are still inside the atmosphere so drag is still significant.
As you go higher you will have more option for example 
1. If you are out of atmosphere there will be no more drag and you will have better option with rockets that only perform better in vacuum
2. Once you are in orbit you can do gravity assist to push you higher.
I understand that you are trying to design subsequent stage but remember if we falter before we leave atmosphere then we are doomed. So just food for thought: Do you have enough thrust in your first stage? (Not that I doubt you but just too keep you in check)

The node has a default setting of 1MB, no EB, no AD. That means the node has certainty of following 1MB no matter what. With EB/AD there is no certainty how much confirmation you need to wait because that is highly dependent on what is miner's setting  fragmentation.
Think about it this way. Do you think miner will upgrade to EB2 at the same time? The first miner to upgrade will be vulnerable to attack by someone who produces 2MB block, miner building on the same block and getting orphaned. Same thing with node with EB2. Similarly after majority upgrades the miner node/miner with EB1 will be at risk. The only way to eliminate this risk is for everyone to upgrade at the same time, which is completely impossible. 
Satoshi's solution is to introduce flag day, something that is not configurable in BU.

Again, I'm not against alt-implementation, I'm against garbage implementation. btcd, for example is pretty competent.

Yes but for normal block propagation you will still need the signature, otherwise miner might confiscate coin, so you need two kind.
One with signature, one without. I don't see that in any competing implementation. They seems to only remove it from the calculation . But it is still being propagated.

Just a difference in terminology I guess. Not really sure about OP but normally when I talk about 'routing not yet solved' I am also talking about route selection on top of route finding.
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:27:24


I don't think securing enough hash power to produce 20mb block is trivial. Furthermore 20mb will propagates much slower than 1mb block. If everything else fails I will rely on the 'goodwills of the miner' aka 'it is in the miner's interest for Bitcoin to succeed' (Last one is the weak-ass of argument I know).
Here's my take on this: I know I'm choosing the lesser of two evils. Everything in this world is a trade-off. How 'secure' is secure? How 'decentralized' is decentralized? The way I see it Blocksize increase seems to be a better option (kick the can down the road, buy some time).
I'd really wish one of you core-dev that is against this would come up with alternate plan opposed to Gavin. Right now all I'm seeing is increase vs 'no plan'. I'd really need a concrete plan to judge how feasible it is. If you aren't going to increase the block size what do you propose? Stunt the growth? Let the fee increase? How high must the fee be before we increase the block size? For how many years? How long does it took to solve the scalability issue (e.g LN)?
@_date: 2017-02-20 00:07:22
Uh, no. The whole purpose of multiple implementation is to flesh out spec, to make it easier to review, and to innovate in terms of performance optimization. When you are mining (or for that matter for any real world usage) you should be doing that "behind" one code.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:45:28
Except for Dev's incompetence, you mean? Every single alt already added SegWit except BU.
@_date: 2016-03-02 09:04:39
A little bit flaky I think. Even with Bitcoin I sometime have difficulty sending non-standard tx (having to disconnect and reconnect multiple time). With LN this issue seems to be a little bit worse because I cannot disconnect and reconnect at will since there's locked fund involved. 
Personally I think routing should do more than just find route but also find a reliable route.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:51:53
Let's say we have 75-25 split of EB1/EB2. By producing 2MB block EB1 miners can force all EB2 to mine on a split chain until their AD runs out. That means the EB1 chain will have 25% less competition until then.

Uh, it does. You are making the system inherently less secure for no good reason. Right now any merchant can be reasonably certain that 2-conf is as good as final. With BU that guarantee is gone. 
I mean if you want miner-controlled blockchain BIP100 can do what you want. There is no technical drawback to that.


Actually I find it very funny that people who supports BU keeps mentioning "Schelling Point". That's the same words Vitalik used before ETC slaps him in the face.


Like bitcoin.com disaster? This statement is without any base, just like a leap of faith. It will require miner to upgrade **at the same time**. Even in critical patch like BIP66 it took miner 2 months to upgrade. The worst part is ViaBTC wants to have only 75% of hash rate only to activate.


So what are they working on now? You can't tell, because it is a closed door meeting.
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:57:16


That is a significant misunderstanding of how Bitcoin work. To spend output you need to answer a question. utxo-that-is-soon-tobe-txo is the question, signature is the answer. So you only need signature during spending. To be a properly validating node you only need to store the question (utxo), the answer is only need to be provided once.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:46:37


That's the key point. For 10 hours, maybe not. But forever, yes. How about until your AD6 runs out and with significantly less difference in hashrate? How much advantage can you get? This is even better than selfish mining.
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:01:48
Reading political undercurrent is definitely not easy but right now my impression is most miner will defer their judgement to exchange/core devs. As long as both sides agree I don't think miner will block it. 
Also since mining has Poisson distribution the probability of the fork getting activated with less than 95% hashpower is more than 0...
@_date: 2015-05-11 04:46:16


Here's my opinion. Short term because of (1) limit increase should be the way to do it. Long term efforts should be more directed towards micropayment channel rather than changing critical security parameters.

Like I said, the same thing preventing this from happening is the same thing preventing 21M limit being lifted. SegWit will happen I'm telling you, even if it takes 25 years to do that.


Not sure about that. What if BU or some other shitty alt implementation  manages to pull it off?

TL;DR secp256k1's parameter appears to be chosen random enough to be secure as according to Mr. Brown

@_date: 2017-02-09 15:53:58


And without doing so BU solution should not be pushed to the mass. This is just the tip of the iceberg though.


The fact that miner can make change is irrelevant. My point is the relative security of default value proposed in the software can change at any time because miner can change their block size setting at will. This is my entire quote:


BU program you download a year ago might no longer be secure today. The security will be the weakest especially at transition/upgrade stage. People unaware of this will be bitten pretty hard. BU doesn't offer smooth transition for people. Unless you are assuming miner is going to put 1MB forever. In that case I have no issue.
Core, OTOH has pretty absolute guarantee with miner and node agreeing on 1MB limit. If there is going to be a blocksize increase it won't happen by mistake (or attack)

See above.


At least there isn't anyone suggesting to change the value in their software. Just because people want to commit suicide doesn't mean that doctor should help them.


Yeah, because users are always at fault when it is actually the developer's job to minimize this kind of thing.


Eh, actually Core chain will be worth more. What innovation do you have on BU side? I don't think people over there are even aware 2MB block doesn't means that it will always consume 2x resource.


Decide at which block you want to fork, and hard code that into the software. At least that doesn't require you to be awake when the transition happen.

I disagree here. With current inflationary system it means that there is always increase in money supply. The question is who receives this increment? Is it the poor? Nope, it is mostly the rich. Let's take the recent QE as an example. Who receives the printed money? The Bank right? The same irresponsible Banks who causes 2008 Financial Crisis. 
The poor can't do anything. If they save, their net worth will decrease over time due to inflation. If they spend they will lose it. So what can they do? They spend it on something they can't afford with the hope that it will raise in value, e.g houses which is one of the causes of subprime mortgage crises.
Now consider deflationary system. The poor can fight back by saving. Being rich means nothing if you are not financially responsible. Right now, with bailout you are basically rewarding those who are financially irresponsible.

@_date: 2016-03-03 15:13:50
There are a lots of good reasons for don't wanting but I think some of the one you listed are bad ones:


I think it is too premature for this. Personally I am a hodler so congestion doesn't affect me too much but right now my wealth is being continuously being diluted. I, for one, would like to think it is being diluted for a good cause and I think having a fee market develop so early is against my ideal. A temporary one might be ok but not a permanent one.


The same can be said on hard fork.


Sure, I think the current 1 year is pretty reasonable.


Two side of an argument here. Yes we don't want it so easy to hardfork (e.g 21m limit) on the other hand we also don't want it too difficult(e.g pow change in case of 51% attack).


Well that is just plain bad reason. It is nearly the equivalent of an ad-hominem attack in a debate.


Yes this is a good one. Although blocksize limit won't do much to fix this. A really good fix will probably require a hard fork. 


Yup, this is a really good one. Which is why the exponential nature of BIP101 really scares me.


True, a control-freak leader will probably only attracts a bunch of 'yes-man' which is probably a bad thing. On the other hand no guiding hand also lead us to what happen today with community on the verge of fracturing.


Personally I think Wlad should force everyone to come into consensus long time before (I think Jeff raise this issue multiple times in the past). Don't release 0.10/0.11 until everyone agrees on a roadmap to increase the limit. Sure it is easy to make a decision on easy things (OP_CLTV, SegWit, opt-in RBF) but the only time leadership counts is when deciding on difficult things, like right now.
A benevolent dictator is much better system than democracy (unfortunately it is also much more fragile since no human is perfect).

Did you notice the node settings fragmentation before attack? The nodes version are all over the place. Some people are still running 0.12.1 or even 1.0.0 (which doesn't affect you if you don't mine). Here, take a look at this snapshot at 03/07/17:

With HF approach you're breaking every single light clients and block explorers out there, in addition to forcing everyone to upgrade. It is difficult enough to convince people to upgrade to 0.13.0 because of C++11 and now you want to force all developers to do your bidding? With SF approach at least you're giving people time to understand and implement the change. If in the end HF is necessary there is a minimal change required.

1. Right now miners are engaging in SPV mining to the detriment of users. That's a short term gotcha. Especially when this strategy doesn't work long term.
2. You don't need mining farm to produce a single block.
3. When 4-blocks reorg is the new normal do you think there is a long term damage? No.
4. Does it take malice to screw up the network? No. Just took another incompetent Bitcoin.com pool to split the network
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:26:41


**That's** a promise. (And fee can be gamed) by miner


No, that's only one of them (and bigger block will just lower the fee again). Others are:
1. UTXO growth
2. Block propagation
3. Unknown attack vector
(1) is pending for TXO MMR. (2) already partially alleviated with compact block but it requires testing in real world for effectiveness at bigger block, which means segwit activation. Same with (3).
Even TXO MMR might not be approved. It is still in conceptual stage. It may or may not work. Someone may not agree with it and choose to NACK it. There is no guarantee ever. 
If you want further capacity increase signature aggregation is still  closer than a hard fork (which again requires Segwit to function effectively).
So activate Segwit or no deal at all.
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:46:32
LOL, you mean like how they attack ETC? A PoW change is always on the table. OTOH How much do you think a chain that is not Lightning-ready worth? Or for that matter, a chain without light client and block explorer support (yes people, those need to upgrade too)
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:21:49
*Sigh* Again, you only need to compare with the competition.
In terms of capacity increase: Better than 2MB block both because it avoids supply shock and making worst cause UTXO growth the same
In terms of quadratic hashing: Better than limiting transaction to 100kb
In terms of malleability fix: The only malleability fix that offers signatureless IBD, avoids increasing UTXO set compared to BIP140, not whack a mole like BIP62
Nothing is better than what segwit offers.

Price drives the miner and not the other way around. People don't care so much about the 'security' of the chain, only its feature.


Possible. Median EB has not been addressed, and neither does sticky gate. All of these have been handwaved away.


All of those are possible. BU doesn't have Lightning remember? And since it doesn't have Segwit signature aggregation or Lamport is not possible.

I still don't get it. What is the reason behind the objection to 95%? AFAIK no miners are vehemently against the increase (even if there is I seriously doubt they could be as high as 5%). As long as Core dev and pro-big-block side agrees on the code miner will just follow. As can be seen from BIP66 deployment as long as there is overwhelming consensus we can reach this number nearly as fast as 75%.

My response to you will be centered around single most important (to me) question:
Are we okay with letting the tps number constrained by the Block Size for a significant period of time?
Personally I'm not okay with that. Maybe I'm okay with seeing occasional 1MB Block for around a year (just consider it Work in Progress for Better Future, We Apologize for the incovenience). But after that I'll probably look for something else with Black Jack and Hooker. 
My reason: I've already subsidized the miner with inflation and they're charging me again for making transaction? Who do they think they are? The Government? Asking to pay tax after printing money? I'm okay once the subsidy goes down to 3.125BTC/Block, but before that? No Way Jose. 


I believe our current consensus is that we are not yet ready for this (I saw Mike Hearn's Dead Kittens).


Maybe we have different ways of solving the bottleneck. The way I do it is I hammer the  (while working on the rest in background). Reason: Whatever I do for  bottleneck won't matter if I don't solve 




This will require some sort of fork in itself that is probably more dangerous than 20mb block increase.


Here's the question. We're going to do this at some point in the future right? We might as well do it now rather than wait until the network goes 10-100x bigger. To me the shadow of 2013 fork is more real than the hypothetical decentralization-loss/miner-manipulation.


OK, we need more study. I can accept that but remember we also have deadline (at least to me).

You do understand the difference between sustained attack that makes temporary impact and the one that makes permanent impact, right? With compact block the bandwidth risk is already minimized. With full blocks this kind of sustained attack is really costly.

@_date: 2015-05-11 02:43:26
I'm afraid I have to agree with you. 20MB Block is important because of pressure from Bitcoin usage. This time it is just change for convenience sake. We have to remember that change to some number in Bitcoin can have major impact on the way Bitcoin works.  At least we need to study orphan rate and stress on the bandwidth, especially the small miner's. No test (at least not any that Gavin mention) on testnet and he just throws it into the crowd. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:54:59
For example 75% of the miners are on EB1, 25% of the miners are on EB2. If a node put EB2 they are at risk of someone mining 2MB blocks, being extended by 25% of the miners by x blocks and then all those x+1 blocks are being orphaned by EB1 miner so they will need to increase the number of confirmation. By how many confirmation? You will need to run simulation. 
That is just for 2-way partition. 3 way partition or more will require more simulation.
Sure you can just ask to require for more confirmations but that will just piss your customers off.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:05:58

Yeah, any idiot can tell you that correlation between x and y means either x causes y, y causes x, or z causes both x and y. By putting log scale he actually makes more emphasis on Bitcoin flash bubble. During bubble of course people make more transaction because they want to take advantage of it (move BTC to exchange). It's not that Bitcoin's value comes from the number of transaction but rather the number of transaction comes from Bitcoin's value.
Here's my attempt to recreate the chart in linear scale:
There's period between 2014-2015 where number of transactions goes up while bitcoin value goes down or flat (edit: A period conveniently missing from the chart). The reason Metcalfe's Law doesn't hold is Bitcoin is still primarily used for speculation.
Like Greg says, data manipulation, plain and simple.
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:03:49
Here's my thought. Based on what I have 20MB change is safe. I am, however open-minded (based on our exchange I get the feeling that you aren't). Unfortunately due to asymmetry on the proof I can't show that this change is 100% safe. 
You, on the other hand can give an example of how this change can be exploited. If you do so you can change my mind.
Right now if Gavin actually forces a Gavincoin in 2016 I will be on his side. And by then we might actually have 2 coins, which is going to be ugly for sure.

I never said that although other people did. In fact I was wondering why they were always silent about their funding. This makes more sense than Roger providing the funding. 
It seems plausible that it was spread purposely as a red herring. It is easier to cover up the fact that Acceptable Depth provides advantage to the miner when you claim that the funds comes from someone that doesn't have anything to gain.


Don't put word into my mouth, I've never said that. What I said is BU favors the miner, of which a subset includes Jihan (who also happens to produce ~70% of the ASIC).


Wow, you tried really hard at straw manning my argument, aren't you?


1. Bitmain provides the funding to BU
2. Acceptable depth gives advantage to miner to set minimum resource requirement to run a full node.
These are facts, and not conspiracy theories.

Besides, It is entirely possible that in the first 4 years BU has more economic power and started to fall under its own weight and Core started to catch up with Signature Aggregation, Lightning, etc. BU will be totally wiped out by then, unless they lie when they said "support the majority".

The problem with checkpoint is that it goes naturally against "emergent consensus". Their reasoning is that longest chain is valid chain. By checkpointing they are no longer allowing the consensus to emerge. 
This means Core's chain is actually more antifragile than BU's chain. When Core's chain is losing the worst case would be higher difficulty until the next adjustment period. When BU's chain is losing OTOH their chain is completely wiped out (And now people hodling on Core's chain suddenly found an extra stash in their pockets).

Even if you insist on storing the signature it can be sharded.

The problem with Nassim Taleb is that he always oversimplify everything. Take a look at his-butcher-as-surgeon example. He assumes that the butcher already worked a long time as a surgeon. He doesn't consider the probability that, let's say the butcher is only hired by the hospital owner so that it fulfills head count for regulatory requirement. Or that the butcher bamboozle the hospital owner so that he could be admitted to the hospital. If the butcher has worked a long time and has a good track record, sure. But otherwise I will suspend my judgement out of curiosity and do further investigation. (BTW we have a "butchers" in Core dev, Peter Todd only has a Fine Arts degree, also hard-core-Catholic Luke-jr, the last person you'd expect to make a capable devs)

Bitcoin is not yours. If you disagree the only way is to convince people who disagree with you otherwise.


The invisible pink hand you're talking about can lift the block size limit anytime they want. The reason we are stuck at 1MB is precisely because the free market decides that it is the right size.


Satoshi's last post 
Even with 1MB limit Bitcoin is not DoS-proof. We should be adding limit instead of removing them.


It's not artificial if it is to prevent DoS.


Without block size limits Bitcoin can't retain its 21M BTC property.


all available transactions. If the block size is not large
enough to meet demand for transactions, we believe the
qualitative content of all our results continue to hold, but the
quantitative impact is mitigated.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:41:08
1. Why do you assume that the fee remains constant at 100 sat/byte whether it is 10MB or 1MB? Because it's not. When the block size is full transaction fee will increase that the honest participant will outcompete the attacker.
2. The purpose of the attacker is to bloat the blockchain and not to make other people inconvenienced. You see that UTXO attack happening again today? NO. Why? Because the block is full that an attempt to push transaction will result in superlinear increase in transaction fee.

You do realize that Core will reject all blocksize &gt; 1MB right?

The opposite is not true though.


Like ETC did?
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:37:34




That's the whole blockchain. So the correct comparison is 10GB vs 30-40GB and 1.2GB(I think Jeff Wilcke reported this number somewhere as pruning is not yet implemented) vs 1.4GB.
Still looks pretty concerning.
Also note that the current Ethereum usage is comparable to Bitcoin usage in 2013 so it is not too bad.


Actually this is where things go pretty interesting. Bitcoin core developers choose to limit growth while developing solution(LN) while on the other hand Ethdev choose to let things grow (with centralization risk in mind) while developing solution (sharding in this case). 
Which approach will win? Who knows. Only time will tell. Personally I am just a spectator and it has been a really interesting match so far.

No, the paper doesn't assume that. If a miner sees no more transaction in the mempool there will be temptations to orphan that block until there is enough transaction in the mempool.


Nobody ever says that. Miner is not the only processing the block. My full node also needs to. And miner doesn't pay for my full node. Ergo miner can't know the true cost of transaction.

You will need to separate the accounting between the legacy and the new one. That will be another spaghetti.

The thing is the core devs refuse to even produce a working 2mb option(at least until July I think). The community tends to trust the core devs(at least as a guideline) on what is safe.
Looking at ethdev's analogue they do produce code with really high default gas limit (I think the original one they release last July is the equivalent of 8tx/s and now they add another 50%). Sure they allow the community (e.g miner) to vote it up or down but they do produce the code.

You forgot the part where you explain why.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:57:11
First of all, you can't have a roadmap when you are dealing with decentralized governance. Just to give example of what I'm talking about. Take a look at BIP150/BIP151. End to End encryption. Good idea right? Well actually right now it is being blocked by Eric Voskuil, a libbitcoin dev. His reasoning is that node key that is to be used for key exchange can be used to identify a node, making it easier to do AML/KYC. That means that BIP can't proceed until Eric agrees that his concern has been addressed.
Similarly Peter Todd's full RBF actually give the benefit better mempool sync between nodes since the behavior for mempool replacement becomes deterministic but the problem is that it gives rise to easier double spend so it is not yet merged. Everyone who gives a good reason can block any kind of proposal.
What you can have instead is short term insight. In the short term once Segwit is activated you can actually have Signature Aggregation, which is roughly additional 30%. This have the benefit of both fungibility increase and additional capacity. I don't expect any opposition since it is overall a big plus (although I don't know if miner decides to block that for political reason).
All the parts below are still on navel-gazing stage so it is not yet guaranteed, anyone can decide to block it at any time.
There is work a on TXO commitment to address UTXO growth rate. 
Once this concern has been addressed it is possible that some form of better fee estimation on the tx is made:
This will make for a better block weight.
I think we have a couple of dynamic block size limit proposal but from what I heard keeping it incentive compatible is not so easy.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:22:44

Nothing to do with block rewards. It's the technology. Once there is no more improvement in semiconductor (which has steadily slowed down in the past 5 years) there won't be anyone to support ever increasing block size.


And I've listed nearly all the wallets listed. Anyone else you can think of?


Again you don't need to upgrade to 0.13.1. There's nearly nothing there except Segwit.


Not even sure what's your point is.


I am not even sure what your point is. I was merely questioning what is the purpose of doing the questionnaire? For survey purpose?


Like I said there is no reason whatsoever to upgrade to 0.13.1 from 0.13.0. Nearly 50% of full node didn't upgrade immediately from 0.12.1 to 0.13.0 after ~4 months passed after 0.13.0 was released.

Right now he can't.


In the future when miners are the only one runs a full node it is entirely possible, especially when he has control over ASIC production


Maybe you can show an example of an article being clearly false?


If this is false why didn't Jihan deny it?


Jihan controls Bitcoin Development Grant.


Why the secrecy? Why the closed door meeting? Maybe you can ask Bitmain/Roger to clarify? Or perhaps even BU devs? All I know is unlike BU most of Bitcoin Core's contributor has a clear funding source.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:20:39
Speaking of Jihan, anyone know who is the recipient of the last Bitcoin Development Grant?


The reason I'm asking is because if it happens that BU were funded by this grant there is a clear conflict of interest. Acceptable Depth clearly gives miner more power over valid chain. This kind of change won't be merged in Bitcoin Core.
Bitmain was the main contributor of that grant. 
And Jihan is actively using that.
This is why a small development team is really bad. There's just not enough check and balance. Say what you want but Blockstream doesn't even make up a majority of Bitcoin Core.

Here's the thing. There are two parties in the agreement. Some part of Core devs (who made perfectly clear they do not represent Bitcoin Core) and the miner.
From the devs:


Johnson Lau have it here:
But there's no pick up (mostly due to F2Pool, see below). So those dev who attended the meeting definitely already fulfilled their promise.
From the miner:


F2Pool already ran Bitcoin Classic. Now not only Antpool ran Bitcoin Unlimited they also fund the development. Who's at blame now?
Sure, miner has the option not to activate Segwit according to the agreement:


But running Unlimited? That's entirely different story.

@_date: 2017-03-04 11:57:15
Yes, they do. But the alternative is to be idling while they validate previous block or wait for the blocks to propagate. When the block reward is big compared to tx fee it is more profitable to do it this way while when the block reward is small enough you start to lose out. Hence the push for bigger block (because they intend to keep transaction fee small). 
OTOH Miners like BitFury who has optimized transaction inclusion prefers to keep block small.

Just in case you haven't realized what we are facing is a power grab, and not an attempt to find a compromise. BU is an attempt to seize power by hashpower from economical power. I mean take a look at ViaBTC's plan.
HF to 2MB? Segwit already provides that, with all the safety measures required, faster lead time and Lightning. Miners simply don't want more capacity. They want control over the network.

You mean dedicating ~1.5 their manpowers? Wow, that sure looks like a lot of resources.


Totally true. Like I said above the competing team is only controlled by Bitmain and this will make decision making super fast. Miners always have Bitcoin's best interest at heart after all. Like mining empty blocks, or even increasing the bitcoin supply if it is needed when there is not enough consumption.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:10:29


User's frustration is about the least damage you can do by 'spamming'. Because of no blocksize limit no one will be willing to increase their fee to defend the network. Result:

If you didn't notice those people are the same one that was being ridiculed by buttcoiner. Bitcoin has never been competitive on e-commerce front. 
You pay for your own fee instead of the merchant? 10 minutes confirmation time? XXX stop accepting Bitcoin because there is no demand?
The truth is the argument that a currency must be spent to be useful is Keynesian, which is antithetical to what Bitcoin is.
Instead why don't we focus on where Bitcoin is really good at? Store of value that can't be confiscated, High friction payment (e.g remittance), Censorship free payment (e.g Wikileaks, Drug purchase).

The main opposition is some people think it is unwise to HF to bigger block without data from Segwit. For example we had to increase soft limit from 250kb to 1MB in 2013.
As the end result this happens:
You can clearly see the impact here:
Segwit attempt to avoids that by solely increasing the space for signatures. But we don't know how safe it is for a further increase. Even this kind (e.g Segwit) of increase might already be unsafe (although it is safer than a 2MB increase)
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:20:49


Ah, yes. Blindly trusting third party. What could go wrong, right? I mean there is no possibility that miner doesn't think there's not enough transaction such that they want to stimulate the economy more right? Like, right now? Especially when increasing the supply comes at no cost to them.
I mean why would Roman empire want to dilute their gold coins? They will destroy the trust in the system...
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:21:56


Again, TCP/IP developers doesn't care if you can run video through it.


Everyone will have an incentive to run a node when something like BU threaten the network. We should always keep the option open for everyone.


When you're talking about UTXO the concern is memory, whose prices increase last year, and not bandwidth.


1. Actually the original 'soft limit' is 250kb. We just increased them in 2013. 
2. Even originally with 1MB limit Satoshi ignores quadratic hashing so even 1MB back in 2008 is already unsafe
3. In 2013 Ghash.io shows that 1MB limit is already unsafe. It was only after relay network was out the network returns to normal.

This gives you the explanation why we only get 2x with Segwit
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:15:57
Well, the duration of back log caused by sudden increase in transaction rate has grown less and less by now. I don't think I've ever seen it more than a day. You're welcome to waste your money though. If it happens that the original Bitcoin chain has higher value miner will just move back. There is no permanent allegiance.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:21:52


@_date: 2017-03-17 17:10:17
Segwit does that for a good reason though. That is to enable signature-less IBD (you will need to re-use two different serializations for bootstrapping a new node). Meanwhile extension block described by Theymos does that solely to increase capacity. Read comment below for better description for argument against extension block.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:05:22


Again, once you have enough hashpower you don't need to worry about getting orphaned. Read Peter Todd's writing above.


High orphan rates caused by bigger block is accidental (as opposed to block withholding). We may not even detect block withholding at bigger block, at least we know some baseline at 4MB.


Again, if you have enough hashpower you don't need to worry about your block getting orphaned.


Citation needed. At Ethereum testnet this behavior is observed at~15tps. Granted there are difference here and there but I don't think that warrants a 10x difference.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:32:13


No, the problem occurs when the orphan rate is so high that it provides incentive for miner to centralize. Not something that can be fixed with parallel validation.
You also need to remember that miner has no incentive to create small block when they have enough hashpower


1. SPV mine doesn't work when transaction fee made up a large portion of block rewards. 
2. What matter is not the average, but the median. The longer block propagation still gives rise to higher orphan, whether or not the average goes down.
3. You also haven't commented on the part where at larger tps compact block is no longer effective.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:45:33

That's what the person I'm replying to is concerned about though.


Developers only care about node's cost (processing, storage, bandwidth).

It is the job of HTTP protocol designer or Web Designer to adapt, and not the other way around.

1a) That limits define who can or cannot run a full node. 
2) Like I said that Satoshi was the one who added the limit
If I have to guess it is part of bug fix, just like choosing most-work chain instead of longest.
3) Ah yes, "I don't know what I'm talking about and I'm simply trying to evade" defense


All are due to the following:
1. their equivalent of "block size limit" is too high
2. There is unknown vulnerability in the protocol
Both can apply to Bitcoin as well.
Unknown vulnerability is unknown vulnerability whatever technology you are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:16:52
From technical perspective, Segwit is the most we can handle right now. From the devs PoV Bitcoin is supposed to be apolitical money. Any changes should be made from technical perspective. The same political pressure to increase block size can be applied to increase Bitcoin supply in the future. 
Besides, have you talked to Jihan? Did he actually mentions that he will accept the compromise? F2Pool and Antpool both already break the HK agreement now. Why should the dev waste their time?

So the question is after hard fork which one is BTC? The one with the original developer? The one with fiat support? Or the one with hashrate support?
I would say the the one with fiat support, because hashrate follow the price.
Also this is no longer true:


@_date: 2017-03-17 15:05:39


So the devs spent many months writing the code (blindly, because there is no real world data provided by Segwit). Segwit activated, crashes in fire, further proving that all their assumption was wrong. What then? Are we going to still insist on activating the hard fork? Who is going to answer for the many months spent for nothing?

It's a stopgap solution while a better block weight is being defined, like this one here:


Similarly due to high fees those balances are now less likely to be used by attacker to bloat the UTXO set. People who have interest in spending those outputs already combined them back before the fee is rising.


Are you in favor of removing sigops limit, then? Or push size? Or maximum message size? Or script size? You need to remember that "the market" includes more than just miner.
You will also need to remember that even with segwit miner can still prioritize their transactions however they want (although they should prioritize it the same way as block weight if they want to maximize revenue)
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:49:27


You have BIP62, which is a whack-a-mole solution. You have BIP140, which increase UTXO set size. You have Flexible Transaction, which breaks all the wallets and block explorers. In addition to that none of them enables signatureless IBD and only FT solves quadratic hashing.

Litecoin never approached Bitcoin's level of transaction. Even at current transaction rate the level of decentralization is much lower than Bitcoin what with F2POOL holding 30-40% of hashrate.

You just assumed altruistic miner instead of economically rational miner.


Yes, it does. Because I need it to ensure 21M limit and no miner dares to confiscate coin. The same thing that ~5000 other nodes did.


Does not compute. If barrier of entry high he can enjoys his monopoly longer
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:27:54


You mean like how miner won't increase block size now? Sure I could get behind that. 
But the thing is they were arguing for blocksize increase before, which actually shows that they are not aware of the true cost of transaction in Bitcoin.


Read what I wrote again.




Is higher orphan rate actually poison Bitcoin ecosystem? People seems to be fine with 5% orphan rate during Ghash.io
Leaving money on the table is altruistic behavior, and not rational.


What gamble? Here's a game theory. Current mempool size=0. I could build on top of latest block, in which case I get 0 fee. 
OR I could orphan that block and get the transaction fee. That block may be orphaned by other miner but it doesn't matter since the alternative is I get 0 fee. More importantly, if there is enough tx in mempool afterwards I can build on top of my previous block getting both tx fee for both blocks
If you assume miner won't take all the money in the first place you are already assuming altruistic miner. Have you ever seen blocks less than 1MB that is not SPV-mined? Nearly none.


Miner doesn't have any incentive to keep 21M limit or not to confiscate coin.
Miner's main expense is mining equipment, not full node. My main expense is full node. What is good for the miner may not be good for me.


There are two parts to this debate if you haven't noticed.

@_date: 2017-03-07 19:56:05
[10 minutes](
You can fix that by limiting transaction size but you will limit smart contract capability (removing the limit after you place them is another hard fork).
Note that Segwit actually fixes that and now there is work on [a better metric]( than transaction size.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:50:06


Errrr..... That's not how it works... You will still need to transport the mempool diff you know? So that people can tell which transaction is included and which transaction is not. How big is the diff?








Limiting transaction size presents problem where you can no longer performs a massive coinjoin, combine multiple inputs together, or even interesting application like confidential transactions.

Eh, why the attack? I've never said that I'm not happy with that. 
In fact, I've actually stated the opposite in the past(however that is irrelevant for our discussion):
I'm just stating the fact. Please don't attack the messenger. Right now Core developer think that it is relatively unsafe to go beyond 1MB (that is a fact), and they decide that it is okay to limit the growth for now so that people can use the blockchain in more efficient way by fee discovery and compressing multiple transactions into one (again just fact, no personal opinion here). 


Again I'm not sure why the negativity. By putting the default number into the code the devs are basically green-lighting the change. As stated in my original post it is too early to see which side is actually the wiser. Please don't put word into my mouth.

Forgive me if I missed something because I admittedly skim it pretty fast. The problem that I have with this work is that it spends too much time on showing why reducing block rate is possible rather than why it is better than increasing maximum block size (the only one I see is one anecdotal evidence at the end that there is less line changed in the source code). In fact  and  shows exactly why it is inferior to increasing maximum block size.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:34:25

1. Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
2. Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
3. Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
1. Reverse other people's transactions without their cooperation
2. Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
3. Change the number of coins generated per block
4. Create coins out of thin air
5. Send coins that never belonged to him

And how much further have we gained? You can't answer that unless you release Segwit.


Bandwidth only grows 50% a year. Hard disk grows 10% a year. Memory prices actually increases. All are negligible.


Uh, it is the same problem.


No, the increased fees prevent those outputs from being split even further.

Note that you will also need to consider adversarial case. Some people just want to watch the world burn by splitting outputs. At worst case scenario people can just fill a single block with a single input and fills the rest with outputs, like this case
This is why it is important to have full blocks, so that people who wants to bad things will need to spend more while people who wants to do good things will need to spend less.

Let's just say that this is where I disagree. Take a look at Ethereum. Having a leader means less than optimal solutions are often implemented that results in a mess in the network. You can say the price is higher now but I doubt that is a thing that will last.


I think he himself already said that he couldn't be careless about what happens with Segwit though. That is the mentality of someone who is used to decentralized governance. Anyone can reject anything at anytime.

That's with the current 4MB already deemed unsafe. And from those how many txs not already inside local mempool? You will need a real testnet for that.


To be effective aggregated signatures requires segwit's new script capability.
By limiting transaction size you will also be unable to provide accurate accounting. Example: You probably can fit more normal 226 bytes (e.g more than 500 of them) in a block than a single 100kb transaction


My experience with that is current GPU's kernel is too big that you can't get enough global work size. I would be happy if you can prove me wrong.

The problem is when the development is held by single authority, which is not the case with Bitcoin Core. There are a lots of universities, independents, and other companies (e.g Chaincode Labs) that contributes to the Core. [Even Blockstream has to eat shit sometimes](
OTOH You should be worried about BU, whose funding solely comes from Bitmain, and has shown that their willingness to bow to their source (e.g giving control over block size to the miner)
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:26:49


1. Why do you assume that two miners will just happen to find block at the same time? This only happens roughly 1-2 times a day. When this doesn't happen parallel validation will do nothing
2. Why do you assume that some people will just continue mining on previous block when they already receive more recent block?


Compact block assumes there is no big different between miner's mempool. At higher tps transaction propagates less uniformly, some miner may already receives some transaction, some miner haven't.

However, I wanted to share one interesting fact. has noticed that OKCoin futures tends to be lower than the spot price quite recently. 
Because futures is basically a promise to deliver the goods in the future it is basically a prediction markets on how the goods will price in the future. 
Normally in bull markets futures tend to be higher than the spot price because people will expect to pay even higher price in the future. Similarly in bear markets the reverse happen. What we are seeing now is that since Dec 2016/Jan 2017 futures have been lower than the spot price by quite a lot.
Purple/dark green is spot price
Red/Light green is future
Anyone please take note Bitcoin's motto is Don't trust, Verify. I still have pretty shitty picture but if anyone wants to improve will be welcomed. I don't have Photoshop (haven't felt the need to use them for quite some years now)

And a bigger block is not a good scaling solution either. Old transaction just can't scale due to quadratic hashing.


So basically you're against adding new transaction type? Even if ECDSA is broken and Lamport is needed? Or are you even against P2SH?


If SegWit is implemented as hard fork old node will be vulnerable to a chain split by malicious miner. In SF miner protects old node, HF no ones protect old node.


Repeat after me: UTXO bloat in bigger blocks is more dangerous than signature bloat.
Besides there will be no block size increase in the future even if we do HF, only block weight adjustment.


It happens to fix all the problems at once! Don't you see how good a solution is? It's like a holy grail! It's how Bitcoin is supposed to be designed in the first place!!

It has a **technical consensus**, which is entirely different than political consensus.
Now, apart from Roger and miners who is against Segwit?
@_date: 2017-02-13 10:14:51


My experience with semiconductor industry is visibility is only 1 year ahead. 5 Years might as well be Goblin Town. So never say never. Maybe in 5 years someone will find out how to work out Satoshi's fraud proof (or maybe no one will), maybe in 5 years someone will find out how to do UTXO sharding (or maybe no one will). Or maybe Sergio's scheme works (or maybe it won't).
However a good R&amp;D will always push the solution that has higher probability of working first. I think Core devs did a pretty commendable job at this. Lightning and Segwit has a decent chance of working with pretty high expected return. In the pipeline we have signature aggregation. Weak block and mempool sync are being worked on but Peter Todd doesn't think weak block is incentive compatible and Luke-jr thinks mempool sync does more harm than good but who knows? It's not R&amp;D if we have 100% certainty.
But more importantly R&amp;D needs data as well from the production. It is understandable that the production might have some concern because they need to do things they never do before. And there is concern that doing things new way may interfere with the old product (e.g cross contamination). This concern is valid but without data from the real word R&amp;D can't proceed. Who know Segwit/signature aggregation might  provide enough incentive to defrag UTXO that further block size increase is possible (or they might not). Or compact block may be more effective than we thought (or maybe not). Blocking new way of doing things is just the stupidest way if we want progress.


Those are things that produce scrap in semiconductor industry. What's the point of producing things that you can't sell?

That also applies to script size and push size as well. Are you against people using Bitcoin for smart contract? BTW do you know there is a maximum message size of 32MB in the protocol? Do you want to remove that as well? Because otherwise your blocksize can't be larger than 32MB. 


We were talking about Satoshi's approach in the context of whether he wants multiple hard fork.
1. Miner forgot to change the limit on time--&gt; Miss revenue
2. Merchant forgot to change limit on time--&gt; Getting tricked into receiving false payment.


Because no one was using them to actually verify payment.

Nope, it is the same. If you delay your enemy node by x second you might as well withhold block by x second.


A transaction that just happen to have excessive witness? Sure, nothing suspicious here guys.


*Sigh* Again, UTXO bloat is scarier than signature bloat. You don't need to do shit about signature, just ignore them. OTOH creating outputs require I/O operation (memory in case of miners) that you probably will need to redo in the future. You can kill your enemy by a thousand cuts instead of wasting your stamina.
Not to mention creating outputs is ridiculously cheap. They only made up like 10% of the transaction size. You can make 10x more outputs by simply doubling the fee

Similarly any altcoin that can result from 2MB hard fork is also fair game. The reason we haven't forked is that many people think that there's significant support for 1MB.


worldcoinninja (one of the Ethereum Olympic winner) is now working for ETC. 
You can even argue that the DoS attack was done by someone who was disillusioned by Ethereum.


The reason people are against HF is that because SegWit already puts too much pressure on the system already.

Does Bitcoin requires trust? In a way yes. You will need to trust miner not to do 50% attack. The only mitigation for this kind of attack is through social layer (PoW change). So yes, Bitcoin is semi trusted.

I am just making a point that scaling according to demand doesn't make any sense since demand is infinite. If you match supply with demand supply is infinite as well.

What's the meaning if you increase block rewards by 100x (e.g when the block reward is too small) and price "crash" by 50x? You still profit either way. Unless you guarantee that the price goes to 0. That's what Central bank do BTW.

You are assuming 4 times x 1 hop or 1 times x 4 hop. 4 times x 1hop is definitely not enough because Kevin Bacon degrees of separation states at least 6. 1 times x 4 hop doesn't leave enough for redundancy (and still doesn't cover Kevin Bacon degrees of separation).

At least these people won't make UTXO bloat even worse.


Like I said **by preventing those outputs from being split even further**. 
Take a look at this chart:
1. Low fee enables July 2015-Sep 2015 UTXO bloat. You won't see those kind of attacks again these days
2. You can see that the graph is perpetually increasing, except for 2 regions. 
(a) The period where 250kb soft limit is reached  (well at least increasing at slower rate). Early 2014 is about time miners started finishing the conversion, take a look at the sudden drop of BTC/kb fee here
(b) Periods starting from 2016 when we started having full blocks again.

Updating a channel costs close to nothing. So let's say an exchange open a channel to you,  the exchanges pays on-chain fee assuming that they will get more from your transaction in the future. This is where you get your Bitcoin. 
You can then open a channel with the drug dealer hub(who happens to be loaded with cash, let's say Silk Road, or Agora who also assumes that they will get more from you in the future).
You can then transfer your Bitcoin from the exchange to the drug dealer hub to your drug dealer. Paying minimum fee each time. 
The exchange and the drug dealer hub expects that with enough transaction it will be enough to cover single on-chain fee.
How expensive do you expect the on-chain fee BTW?
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:25:11

This cabal can withhold block instead of wasting bandwidth. Much easier to do so. Even then the study has already shown 4MB is safe even without compact block.


Whatever risks exists in Segwit is orders of magnitude less than 2MB blocks. If you don't want Segwit "discount" then you don't want capacity increase.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:48:45
**Only** if you have 51%+ hashpower. But even then you will have to be willing to 51% from the very beginning of soft fork meaning lost revenue.

1a) I'm talking about BIP109. BU's change also implement around that many lines without replay protection and without wipeout protection.
1b)You shouldn't be making any claim to things you can't prove
2) Bitcoin is designed to have Block size limit. Even Satoshi's HF code indicate it as such
(No mention about increasing it indefinitely)
Hal Finney knows that Bitcoin can't scale
Even the first person to reply to Satoshi also knows that
If you don't know about that you shouldn't be making comments about "how to fix quadratic hashing"
3) That pieces of code fixes malleability, enables signatureless IBD, prevent UTXO bloat, and fixes quadratic hashing. Compared to BIP109 I'm definitely getting better return on my investment.
4) Nothing to do with our discussions. You were asking for what use case Lightning can fulfill that Bitpay can't. I just gave you one.

@_date: 2017-03-20 16:02:28
1. Ethereum has quarter of the value of Bitcoin, running entirely on GPU 
2. Security will come to chain with most value, not the other way around

Here's the damn thing though. There has been nothing consistent about BU. 
First miner decides block size. Now they add exception when miner is pro-Core. 
First people can freely change their settings. But they won't because afraid of fork (putting EB1). But in real life they actually do (EB1 actually makes up minority of BU node).

@_date: 2017-03-20 18:41:59
This again?
1. The said gatekeepers will not commit unless everyone agrees. He doesn't involve his own opinion at all. In decentralized governance it is easier to remains the same than to change. Just look at the current stalemate.
2. Committing something is more dangerous than not committing at all. You should be more worried about someone inserting a backdoor than retaining the original code.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:35:49


Sorry, can you rephrase that? If I have a HF that original client can no longer sync from(example full e2e encryption) do you object to that?


Nope, I have followed the progress pretty closely though. That's how I know the governance is still better than BU.


Not a democracy. It is a rule by consensus. If someone disagrees we keep things the same.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:24:42


Miner only matters for old nodes, and they are being constantly attacked by miners mining segwit (inadvertently). If that hashrate is bigger than 50%, well same as BU when Core hashrate goes up. Total breakdown.
Their only choice is to create a competing soft fork if they want to split or mine behind a Segwit node if they don't.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:26:50


less on chain transaction != less money. that depends on the fee/transaction.
There is already Bitpay and Coinbase. Lightning just takes care of use case that can't be satisfied by neither centralized 2nd layer nor on-chain transaction.

Unbalanced channel is bad because it gives the incentive to the person with zero balance to close the channel with non-zero balance(prior state of the channel).

I am not aware of any. Are you?


July 2015 incident shows that.


And that shows that absent blocksize limit miner wouldn't know what to do unless being explicitly shown (e.g non-standard)


Wallet needs to routinely combine inputs or be smarter in input selection. That is not an option in resource-scarce environment.


Well, luckily with Lightning you will no longer need to have a hundred of inputs that needs to be combined.


Think of it like carbon tax. You need to do it, or there will be no more blockchain to talk about.


Well, you will need to start to look into other options then, like payment channel, or even alts. Ideally we should have Lightning.

The cost of adding transaction to a block is negligible, just like cost of adding supply to Bitcoin is negligible.


And some miner will not like it. It is up to the duty of the economic power to regulate miner.


Like I have repeatedly said before. Miner is not the only one deciding the supply of block space, just like they are not the only deciding the supply of Bitcoin


Actually the link you mentioned also says predatory pricing **will** reduce fee below cost. And it argues that it will not be a problem because competition will just spring up later. In Bitcoin's case the full node owner may not like it because that will cause instability.

I know of recursive attack even before DAO attack and the reason I don't put my money in is because there's too much spaghetti in the code that I can't audit them properly. I thought Vitalik was aware of this attack, since he repeatedly argues the use of send over call. I assumed that he properly audits the code before putting his own money in. Guess what, apparently he doesn't. That's one sign of incompetence

@_date: 2017-03-10 20:06:42


And BU ignores all the risk that are already understood.


No, it's not. Simple block size increase has been discussed for 6 years. BIP109 is a simple block size increase, BU is not.
1. BU introduces a brand new game theory called "emergent consensus", which is completely incompatible with Nakamoto consensus
2. doesn't propose a replay protection even though they are offering a hard fork
3. can be wiped out if 1MB chain in the end comes up ahead, 
4. accidentally fork the network because of shitty peer review, 2 times nonetheless (once in testnet, once in mainnet, different root cause) 
5. vulnerable to UTXO bloat, 
6. vulnerable to medium EB attack, which is not yet fixed
7. Vulnerable to sticky gate attack, also not yet fixed


Segwit has been under development longer than "emergent consensus", and it is still within "Nakamoto consensus"

@_date: 2016-06-01 11:08:27
Yes, but remember not everyone can stay online all the time. Some part of the solution to this problem is that they pass the 'punishment' transaction to the third party under the agreement of reward sharing. It will be difficult to run this scheme if there is no reward to be shared.

You can easily detect that by orphan rate. If the case is severe enough people can demand PoW change. Looking at the current orphan rate I don't think that is happening.

@_date: 2017-03-09 12:10:34
1a) I didn't quote Satoshi anywhere on this part. Reading comprehension problem?
2) He puts it in main.h together with COINBASE_MATURATION (this is back when Bitcoin code was still less modular). If you don't define that as "consensus layer" I don't know what is.
3) None of John Blocke's medium blog has any technical reasoning. The fact that you can't explain it in your own words means you have no idea what you are talking about.

@_date: 2016-06-22 14:02:05
As I have said before they **don't** consider the fee. They are prioritizing their own transaction (the exchange) over the others irregardless of the fee. This is one form of whitelisting.

A little bit disingenuous thing for Samson Mow to say.

I'm actually a little bit disenchanted over all these blocksize limit debates (not really sure why I still bother probably just feeling like letting it all out) and you'll probably not read this anyway (it is over 9 hours after the original post after all) but I'll just post this anyway.


There's such a thing as soft limit which miner can freely determine(on top of minimum fee requirement). Of course you can complain that full node doesn't have any say over this but originally there is supposed to be no distinction between mining and non-mining node(one cpu one vote). Complaining about election result when you never vote is meaningless. Accessibility to mining equipment is a separate issue that needs a fix. From the network perspective there are only mining power and economic power, anything else is non-observables that are powerless.


It does. I think you are mistaking parent poster's view as no-limit at all rather than miner-imposed limit. Right now the limit is software enforced rather than miner-imposed.


The reason is because hard fork needs to be synchronized. There is a risk that by upgrading Bitcoin you will be split off the network. Satoshi is not ready to coordinate for that. Nothing to do with limit at all.


Uh, actually the default soft limit was 250kb(not really sure if there is any older limit before that). Before 2013 the limit was never hit. 
Anything that satisfy the fee requirement (or priority transaction criteria) goes. Mike Hearn removes that limit in 2013.


I think this is what OP meant. Right now the limit is not miner-enforced but rather 


Of course there is quadratic hashing issue but that shouldn't be solved with limiting blocksize (which is rather ineffective anyway).

Using your comment as a placeholder to reply to sorry :(


At a cost of higher inflation. Try to do that in Bitcoin and people will slap you away. Not to mention short block time means you can't use compact block.


Except letting miners set a gas limit is not incentive compatible. It's the essence of regulatory capture. Monero has a better solution at a cost of perpetual inflation.


Unlike UTXO, account-based transaction model verification can't be parallelized.


At a cost of higher inflation and can't use compact block.

No one knows what will happen in the future. Fee will continue to grow until it stops. Where it stops I don't know. I used to want a dynamic block size limit but with technology slow down I'm not really sure I want them anymore. Near term the math still works out. 
Personally I think we still have a lot of leeway in terms of fee. It is still less than a dollar now. Even if we increase by 10x or 100x many people still can afford it. 
But even if we do have that situation it is still better than status quo because
1. BofA can't do fractional reserve
2. BofA can't know where your destination provided you do multihop payment
3. Since it is a hot wallet a hub has an incentive to keep themselves small just to avoid being robbed. (although it is entirely possible there will be an asic just to run LN node)
4. BofA will still need to provide $1 for every $1 the client has.

Well, to be fair I sort of see problem with DAO coming. In hindsight probably I should've been more vocal about it (unfortunately they push it so fast I don't have the chance to say anything about it). I mean there are people listing problem with it like here:
I've seen a lot of them are being dismissed. While it is true that most of them are not related to the recent bug the problem with bug is that most likely what you see is just the tip of the iceberg. When you have a list of bugs one or two of them are bound to be critical. List of bugs also meant that the concept is not being well thought out.


As long as you keep the system simple you can at least limit the attack vector. As far as Lightning is concerned I would say that it is simple enough that the only two parties involved are the one who can affect the outcome. 


Well 8 years track record shows that everything is fine, nothing is sure in the world. I see a lot of similarities between IC accelerated test and survival of a decentralized system. Most failure will happen within a few hours(IC)/months(decentralized system) and after that the failure rate will drop until it increases again in years(IC)/decades(decentralized system)(or perhaps century? to early to tell)
I mean in the real world someone can get a leak of your contract (e.g trade agreement) to take advantage of it (offer a better deal). It is pretty much the same thing.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:06:47


Can't even be bothered to do apple-to-apple comparison. First of all I'm not really sure where you're getting 15 tx/s. 4,000,000 gas limit/21,000 gas used to make tx/15 s block time=12.7 tx/s. This is **theoretical** throughput, something you can achieve if everyone only uses Ethereum to transfer Ether to one recipient. 
In comparison Bitcoin can handle 7 tx/s if everyone only uses that with 1 input and 2 outputs (one for change address). With SegWit you will roughly get the same figures as Ethereum. All with 2GB pruned blockchain instead of 15GB.
Edit: Just in case 's reply suddenly magically appears below:


Were you there when we did Olympic? Because I was there. When we hit 25 tx/s ONLY 2 MINERS ARE CONTROLLING the blockchain. That's the main reason block time was being bumped to 17s from the original 9s.


Not enough of a safety margin to prevents the last attacks apparently.


You are neglecting that p2p can't be modeled the same way as centralized system. A new node needs to catch up from beginning it is not enough that your system can keep up, it will also need to be 100x faster to be able to contribute to the network.


Yes, putting the number in will give you 13.6 instead of 12.7. Not a whole world of difference there, isn't it?


If you are going to cite real world scenarios you should do so both for Ethereum and Bitcoin. A typical DAO transaction for example costs 100,000 gas

My point is that the transaction itself serves economical purpose. OP_RETURN 0 transaction serves 0 economical purpose.


"Strange way of putting it"? What do you mean? Block weight is related to segwit discount. 4\*base+witness.
You are arguing that keeping the discount factor constant at 4 is important but you don't realize that keeping bandwidth rational is one of the technical consideration?
This is the link you provided:


So the reason the discount is 4 is to keep block size below 4MB.  If you change the block weight of course the discount factor need to be changed.


You idiot! Every single piece of segwit as soft fork has a purpose. There is no difference between swsf or swhf


There is already a split. How is Segwit2x can "heal some wound"? Antpool can support bcash anytime they want.

I've seen a variant of this argument quite often (mostly in forms of decentralization is not a binary state). But guess what, even transistor is not exactly a binary state but it simulates one by having exponential change between 0 and 1.

Well in this case the whitehats want to go faster and it's good for them. Let me remind you that bribing miner with fiat is one possible attack in Bitcoin. This is one type of those attack. It messes around with fee prediction for one. 
Let's have a thought experiment. Let's say BTCC's hot wallet is being hacked with both BTCC and the hacker is owning the same private key. BTCC will prioritize their own saving transaction over the hacker. Is this something wrong?

Well, I do blame miner on that UTXO blow up on July 2015
You can even see it on your own chart:


Not being spent means not being split further. So it won't grow.
You can see that there is faster growth about the time soft limit was lifted (Jan 2014). 


So now wallets must start to combine outputs. You can clearly see it on the chart. UTXO sometimes drops. (it was continuously going up before)

Pre DAO? Yes, perhaps it is decentralized. Post DAO? No, it's not really.
Don't believe me? Let's recap what happened before, during and post the last Geth-Parity fork.
1. No one raises an alarm that there is not enough testing done on the consensus mechanism
2. After all the "no, this won't set a precedent" bullshit during DAO you guys mess with the state, **again**. This time with no opposition. Even if all of you agree that immutability is worthless there should have been someone who disagrees on technical debt basis.
3. Miner agrees to forfeit revenue on 165 blocks no questions asked
4. When it was revealed that Parity has a bug Geth straight away agree to reproduce bug. What's the point of multiple implementation if in the end you guys still go for bug-for-bug compatibility approach?
Right now Ethereum is only decentralized in a name, really. It won't make a difference if the Foundation (or Vitalik, I am no longer certain if they are a separate entity now) code their key into the program to select which chain is valid.

I would love to hear how he plans to totally fix malleability for old style transactions though. Sounds like the case of someone demanding the impossible. The truth is there is only so much improvement that can be done on the old-style transaction. Even FT will introduce a second kind of transactions that will destroy fungibility. Meanwhile, once inside an LN channel the fungibility actually **increases**, with no one knowing where you directs your payment.
Besides, even for old-style utxo you will need to send it to 2-of-2 multisig. That's like saying 1-of-1 utxo is no good here, go spend it somewhere else (2-of-2). That's just how Lightning works, you can't use 1-of-1 utxo.
One more point, with CSV and CLTV it is actually possible for people to create Lightning with normal 2-of-2 multisig. It is just annoying with its limited lifetime. People are free to code it (although I doubt someone would)
 I'm not sure would be commenting here though. Never seen him around so much.

1. Empirically miner is still engaging in SPV mining even with relay network (which ideally should also be retired). If the block size is optimal miner wouldn't be able to tell the difference whether or not they engage in SPV mining
2. 4MB is about the limit in terms of bandwidth for current technology. 
[Source 1](
[Source 2](
SegWit actually delivers 2MB-equivalent so it is not pretty bad. Why not 4MB? That is to keep the current worst-case UTXO growth the same as if there is no block size increase. Right now there is no incentive to keep UTXO growth minimal, which is why it was possible for SatoshiDice to put their messaging system inside the blockchain. 
If you want more capacity you probably could replace block size with block weight (SegWit is a step towards that direction), but it just wouldn't happen overnight.
@_date: 2016-11-05 07:43:24


Actually the magic number is somewhere around 4MB.
SegWit actually delivers 4MB under worst case scenario. 
Hopefully we could get more if compact block gives a good result but we will need to transition from block size to block weight since bandwidth bottleneck is partially lifted. This transition has been partially started with SegWit.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:00:12


Miners are free to change prioritization. But they will prioritize it that way if they want to maximize income.


It makes worse case UTXO growth the same as if there is no blocksize increase, which is better than a plain blocksize increase.


Block size increase over 4MB is unsafe
Combine that plus an effort to keep worst case UTXO growth at the same pace gives you the figure for the discount.


Firstly, SPV security means that a node can't tell if 21M Bitcoin has been inflated, which is not the case. Secondly, 
in case of hard fork unupgraded nodes will have zero security.


Hard forking to a plain larger blocksize is a madness. Like it has been said before the incentive scheme in Bitcoin is not balanced yet. Paying per bytes only assumes that the bandwidth is a bottleneck, which can (and will) start to change.


The default setting is to accept maximum PoW at certain depth. That is the same as "leave it to the miner". I mean seriously, right now I can leave the maxblock set to 750kb, that will just leave me on a separate fork.
Besides, let's sybil and orphan each other's block until a consensus is found. A really barbaric solution. Not to mention opening up a possible attack vector.


That's not a totally bad thing. At worst altcoiner will fork away, at best a better solution will be found.

Who the fuck cares? There are 100+ other contributors to Bitcoin Core. I am not a Core dev and I can see clearly why increasing blocksize is a bad idea. Despite what wants you to believe Peter Todd doesn't work for Blockstream. Neither is Luke-jr. He was only a contractor at one point in time and seeing his hermit-like attitude I doubt he cares very much about money.
All the "Blockstream Blockstream" screaming just that. A lack of technical argument.


From what I see. Yes. There will probably be financial return in terms of network effect from Bitcoin usage.


IIRC they also have a small mining ventures. It certainly would help if they disclose but I don't see the needs for them to disclose it to people unless they own a shares in Blockstream.

A fork will always partially break Bitcoin's security model. That's why it is bad. Even hard-fork in the future would partially break Bitcoin's security model because there is no way to guarantee everyone has upgraded. At least with SF we can gauge the amount of security judging from the hashrate. With HF there is no way we can do that.

Actually I equally blame people who puts money in as well. I'm not really sure why but the market for cryptocurrency is somewhat inefficient in that information is not directly reflected in the price. The fork and the attack is worse than the DAO and yet the market seems to keep their calm.

1. When Ethereum first started geth constitutes 95% of the node simply because they have the best performance and portability. The nearest competitor (C++) has loads of dependency that just wouldn't compile nicely. If an alternative implementation wants to gain market share they should bring something new to the table, either from performance or portability point of view.
2. An implementation that shares ~90% of the codebase shouldn't even be considered "alternative implementation" because it shares 90% of the behaviour of the cloned implementation. It also doesn't bring anything new to the table as that implementation will also have the same bug as the original one.
3. What you have instead is [someone trying to modify the code without any clue what he is doing]( If you really want to be considered as an alternative implementation then rewrite it from scratch.

You can always spend it in an exchange. I mean if PayPal/Visa works out great for you that's great. I'm happy for you. That's just means you are not the target audience for Bitcoin currently. 
Right now there are people using Bitcoin to buy drugs, donate to Wikileaks, escape capital control, hedge against economy, and international money transfer. These are the primary customer of Bitcoin and they don't have much choice.  It's not a good idea to marginalize these people for others who has other options than Bitcoin.

Around 10GB a month? Yes? In the meanwhile most likely caching UTXO in memory might as well be a luxury.
Besides, let's face it once HDD usage goes over 1/10th of total usage a lot of people turns off their node. No one wants to run multiple HDD just so that they can run a node.
OTOH, it is you **yourself** who [said that increase to 4mb is still safe]( this is pre-compact block (and FIBRE).


And that is something that actually happen to Ethereum. If that happen to Bitcoin we will be in full fire fighting mode instead of attempting to improve the protocol.

1. It is crazy to develop a system based on future prediction. [Intel's 10nm has been delayed]( [Storage cost/gb is slowing]( Especially if an attacker can have access to resource that was catered for not-yet-available hardware.
2. To fully understand the implication of increasing the limit you need to understand nonlinearity effect. Just by doubling the limit doesn't mean you double the resource consumption. Ethereum's first attack was thwarted by decreasing the limit 1/3rd its original limit. The third one was contained by halving the limit. So it is not linear. There is a cutoff where things just 'work' and where things just 'don't'

SegWit transaction uses less resource on the system, so it makes sense to be cheaper to pay per byte. 
And old transaction is no way crippled, you still can make the exact same transaction pre and post segwit.

CMIIW but normal pruning would also prune signature. So the 3.8kb spam won't use storage. The kind of pruning that is not yet implemented is the one where an IBD doesn't require signature download.


Which doesn't reflect true cost of a transaction, that kind of counting only considers bandwidth. Ideally there should be another limit for the output part of the transaction, because it cannot be pruned. 


It is cheaper for both attacker and non-attacker. Attacker, OTOH has access to disproportionate storage usage at a discount. An output is only ~10-20 bytes of a transaction but it is the sole source of storage usage.




You just contradict yourself there. 
My point is with SegWit attacker still has to compete economically for blocksize limit with a user while for a straight 2MB increase they directly have access to the free space.

Yet the price continues to rise...
Are we talking about short term or long term? Do you agree that in the long term block size limit is needed? If you do agree then you would agree that Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't have any commitment to protecting 21M Bitcoin limit.
If you are talking short term there is SegWit. And another hard fork (see my comment above).
Bitcoin is not just another company. It is not PayPal 2.0. It is a sound money. As long as we keep 21M limit people will flock to it. The competition is currency, not PayPal. [FedWire itself process a measly 6tx/s] ( We don't want merchant adoption yet. We don't want investor who thinks of it as PayPal 2.0 either, they're missing the points.


How far do you think that transaction fee will go up? A regular SWIFT transfer costs $30. A regular WU transfer costs $10. At that rate we already can replace block reward. Why are you going after $0.01 market?

Technically Adam isn't wrong you know? 
a. I have yet to see a proper research on how "emergent consensus" works in real life. For example what is the recommended confirmation you expect for a certain node settings fragmentation (remember there are a lots of parameters: miners, nodes, EAD, incoming block size limit, etc.)? How much miner loss in case of a consensus breakdown? How effective can someone disrupt the network in case someone creates a block that only half the network accepts? In Ethereum testnet I have seen first hand how a large scale Sybil (e.g Eclipse) can affect how the longest valid chain propagate. BU actually encourages this during dispute. Furthermore since it relies on social phenomena the repeatability of the research may not be so good. 
b. Show me research on how effective BU defense of QH is, which relies on the existence of a fork (which will fail because of SPV mining anyway, which ironically ViaBTC supports both)
Even if Adam is being childish that doesn't give you the reason to do the same. In fact you will probably gather more support by creating pull request and pointing that out, like [Greg did here](

Majority hash power can force a higher blocksize, because it will [benefit them the most]( at the cost of small miner.
The other kind of attack is also possible, where miner with higher hashpower with lower profitability force a blocksize decrease to increase the transaction fee. Miner with lower hashrate that has better margin who wants to bring down the transaction fee will be helpless.

Which is why your action to block the fastest way for additional capacity makes me question your sanity. Either vote to stay 1mb, activate segwit, or fork away (unless, of course you don't even know how to set a checkpoint). Even ETC is safe at 1/10th the hashrate of ETH.

That's not how it works. Let's say block size limit is 1MB. There are 2MB worth of transaction. If a miner mine 1MB there will still be left 1MB to be mined. But if the block size limit is 2MB after all 2MB has been mined there will be no more transaction. The next miner might be tempted to orphan that block to fight for the transaction fee. So it is really crucial that supply outweighs demand. Backlog is more than necessary, it is a necessity.

Actually this is a common misconception. It is a little bit counter intuitive but here goes. When you create a bigger block it is true that it propagates slower but it doesn't matter if you find the next block. In other words, you risk orphaning your block but you also increase the risk for the rest of the network to get orphaned as well. When you achieve enough hashpower the net gain is positive.
If you want a quantitative analysis then read peter todd's analysis I linked above.
@_date: 2016-11-25 19:50:48
I don't think people understand. A lot of small blockers actually want a block size **decrease**. On top of that they prefer to prioritize fungibility improvement over throughput. (for the record I don't totally agree with that). 
The only things that make them agrees to SegWit is the amount of improvement we can have by having that activated. For example LN probably could lighten the load on the on-chain tx (also helps fungibility improvement). Script upgrade improvement would make it possible to work on Signature Aggregation that will help to incentivize people to use CoinJoin to save cost (fungibility improvement). In other words, SegWit is already the best solution we have. 
Traditionally Core never submits suboptimal solutions (which is one of the reason Hearn is frustrated with them). So unless someone pulls another rabbit-from-a-hat trick like Luke-jr did last year I don't see how it is possible.
To be honest, the fact that many miners think that further increase is possible is still quite worrying. That means they can't be trusted to judge over block size.

When first time syncing a new node I/O is actually a bottleneck. That's why there's an effort to keep UTXO inside memory, not storage.

Good, Keynesian economist are the source of inflation. I'd like to see how programmers approach the issue given in the same problem.


It's precisely because you're not computer programmer that you don't understand why increasing blocksize limit is not that simple.


I've seen several things wrong with your model already.
1. Raising blocksize limit is not equal to shifting line from S1 to S2 but rather instead of hitting the vertical limit at F it is going to extend the straight line into let's say F'. You know what is equivalent of shifting line from S1 to S2? Core dev's work on libsepc256k1 and compact block.
2. The cost is not linear. Processing is quadratic at worst case scenario, and storage is an integration with respect to time (so the cost is time dependent). This is just cost to a single node. Cost to the network as a whole is probably quadratic because of the redundancy from network effect(Can anyone correct me?). So instead of hitting F' you will probably hit F'' which is actually a lot closer to F. 
3. As you increase the blocksize the increase in revenue for a small miner is not equal to increase in revenue for a big miner (because of selfish mining-like effect) so in the end the system will tend to centralize and we end up with oligopoly. This is what is called externality, something that is not modeled in Econ 101
If you want to properly approach the problem as an economist you will need to be a computer programmer first. You will also need to stop thinking about block size as a private good because it is actually a public good. I think a lot of people underestimate Core dev's expertise in economics (which a lot of it actually based on common sense).

Nice try, but
1. Just like Core devs the IPCC has neither the authority nor the jurisdiction over such matter. That's why global warming is still not slowing down. They can only make **recommendations**. It is the community who is self regulating.
2. Just like IPCC they make **recommendations** not to increase block size but to use block weight limits to replace it. Any half decent Engineering school would have taught you about Bhopal and Space Shuttle Challenger about not bowing to political pressure.

What do you think will happen when you increase blocksize? A 16 GB increase per month in an attack. That is jtoomim's word, not mine.


Huh, I thought we are talking about hard core users? What does VC has anything to with it? Hard core users will run node no matter what.


You mean like ASIC but just for full node? Hell, no. Go fund your own chain.


If blocks are not full then create a 1MB transaction with a single signature and a whole lots of UTXO. You can force full node to require 16GB/months. Jtoomim's word not mine.


Yes, they are pretty stupid in that. You know they got themselves forked in the testnet right? The only thing preventing a catastrophe is no one actually uses that to verify transaction. Even ViaBTC puts 1MB limit right now.


Any sane implementation will require 1MB limit.
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:30:44
Sorry but I am probably going to start using profanity since I'm tired of explaining this to every single person who comes around...


Why the hell do you cares so much about technicality? The maximum required bandwidth increases, the throughput increases. Are you going to fight over that one single variable?
Newsflash, a hard fork if there is ever going to be any would be in the form of block weight adjustment, not a block size increase.
Right now this is the block weight
    3*basedata + 1*witness&lt; 4000000
In the future it might look like something like this (not finalized)
    50*sigops + 4*basedata + 1*witnessdata &lt; 10M
If that number gives you 10x increase in throughput are you going to fight over "block size not being increased"?


Because most likely Lightning will be ready before there is a conclusion to what a safe block weight would be. Furthermore a hard fork most likely would be 2 years away even on most optimistic estimate (1 year coding and testing and another year for deployment).


Are you going to provide citation on that? Because 4MB is the current consensus. 
[Source 1](
[Source 2](
[Source 3](
And SegWit gives you 4mb maximum bandwidth. We might have more margin now with compact block but without a real network to test the extrapolation (e.g SegWit activation) we can't increase it any more


Ethereum increases their equivalent of block size during transition from Frontier to Homestead. Not only it is full just a few month ago, it is even worse, someone is using the free space to grow the state to 10GB overnight.

And people are busy arguing semantics. Why are you so particular about that variable? Effectively SegWit block can be 2MB or 4MB in size and that means increase in capacity. In fact it is better than just simply increasing MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE because it is a **targeted** increase. Witness is the place where people least likely cause damage.

Your simplified model gives the wrong conclusion to the problem.  And big blocker will just use it as an ammo to support their cause. I think this kind of half-assed analysis is detrimental to the development. 
The truth is we nearly no longer have any margin in the bandwidth (the 4MB talked about in your citation is actually used up by SegWit). I am right now crossing my finger that compact block gives another breathing room from bandwidth point of view. Failing that we will have to resort to Signature Aggregation and Lightning.


Are you mistaking me for He was never known to be polite. I don't think I called names on you.


Please do so.  I'd rather read the 30 graphs rather than one that makes wrong assumption that leads to wrong conclusion (and could be abused by unsightly people).
But please remember that estimating cost is not that simple and given that you don't have CE background I have doubt on the validity of the solution. The reason Ethereum got attacked is because they make a mistake in the cost assumption (and Vitalik is a Thiel fellow, not really sure if that's just because the problem is too difficult or the threshold of being Thiel fellow is too low).


Please do a write up. We'll see if it holds up in peer review.


Increasing 2MB block size is a common sense economics though (and it is already used up by SegWit). I am hoping for something more than that.

Without paid uncles, the decentralization is much worse than Bitcoin with 
1. Higher orphan rate
2. No one paying orphaned block
The design decision doesn't come out of nowhere.


Where is the incentive for including uncle then? Since your subsequent block will have reduced payment.


You keep ignoring the fact that with faster block time centralization pressure exist and to alleviate this you need inflation:
For someone who worships Ethereum so much you seems to be underestimating the amount of analysis that goes into its design decision.


A 4x difference? With compact block you can get around 10x-100x difference in block propagation time.


I'd rather not argue about something that doesn't exist yet.


Except miner can collude to produce more Ether than necessary.


In the case of address reuse there will be a lockup.
I'm speaking empirically here but I synced Bitcoin blockchain from scratch much faster than Ethereum just a few months ago, even with Ethereum consistently having lighter load


Funny you said this prior to that:


You mean they don't value keeping blockchain small while designing the fee to be incentive compatible? Does not compute.
They even went so far as this:


What matters in the end is how large the database is, and how effective is the cache. 
Actually just an anecdote but I have actually produced dust in Ethereum by attempting to spend everything in my account but missed by a little amount. Unlike UTXO you can't guarantee that you have spent everything inside the account.

When you upload whole blockchain to your peer you will need to use a large amount of upload speed. Just like how most likely you will max out your connection when you are seeding a torrent. At 15kb/s most likely he will use most of it to "seed" instead of helping to propagate block/transaction.

Read "Towards combined single block limit". There will be no blocksize increase in the future, only block weight adjustment. The block weight in SegWit is to prevent an attack on UTXO. Read jtoomim's comment on how bad it would be if someone actually do that here:


More like because Big Blocker is screaming "MORE CAPACITY" on top of their lung. It is not yet ready. Even doing (1) only is still a soft fork option.


GibbsSamplePlater is Greg Sanders.
Just to give a more concrete example. New address will not be using Base58.


Uh, you know that Satoshi doesn't make the code very modular right(maybe to decrease attack surface? I don't know)? Just take a look at main.cpp to see how bad it is.


We are still fixing a lot of things he left over. Core devs are working on libbitcoinconsensus when big blockers came over screaming.


1. You can't prove a negative. I don't see how you can make new tx version without inducing technical debt and neither does the Core dev. But that doesn't stop a genius (most likely not Zander though) to think of a way to do that. So Zander can produce working implementation to prove a positive. You see my point?
2. Zander's quote was just a few days ago


What? NO! NO NO NO NO NO. Read how OP_CHECKSIG works here:  It takes into account tx version. FT changes that (and it also changes the way tx id is calculated), so you can no longer spend old coin and expect the sighash to be the same. And you had the guts to accuse me to be on the wrong side of the conversation.


OK, then surely you can point out to the Github commit where he tackles the network object-fetch logic. I spent a lot of times sourcing information for you. It is only fair that you do the same.


Please build one and submit a pull request. Because Zander's last one apparently is not production ready.


It's his. And if it is not complete he shouldn't submit that.

Yes, there is an attack requires users to store 20 exabytes of data. Bitcoiner now found a method to store 20exabytes of data into a space of 1MB. No, that's not how it works. Engineering may seems like magic but there is an actual limit of what it can do.

OK you are assuming miner is a supplier that caters to people's demands, right? In a way they also control the production of Bitcoin.

Disclaimer: I'm not staying in irc channel 24/7 and nor do I required to interact with Core Devs on regular basis so this is just my impression within my limited interaction with them.
With that being said I think Core Devs hostility is overstated. The truth is the learning curve towards creating a secure program is pretty steep. They are more than willing to teach you but if you are too stubborn (or stupid) to realize how the idea is bad even they will get frustrated. 
Personally I've seen multiple music teachers that mentally attacks you worse than the core devs (anyone seen Whiplash? Knock it down a level or two and you have non-fiction). Unfortunately that is also the reason that I never saw it through to see if they actually teach Evil 101 in their Pedagogy class.
Now I'm not saying they are perfect (I've been a victim as well in the past, see previous paragraph above). Peter Todd's latest tweet storm egging and shitting on Ethereum is definitely not a display of a model behavior (actually I'm guilty as charged as well LOL). My impression is also that Greg Maxwell is pretty butthurt that BU manages to get xthin out before Compact Block. But if I have to choose between nice but less competent people (Gavin and Vitalik) and a competent but less nice person to develop Bitcoin Core I would choose the second one anytime. Sure it would be nice to have someone who is both accommodating and competent but such a person might as well be a unicorn.

That would depend on who is your target user base. Cheapskate user will just drag the fee down. And Bitcoin has been undercharging its user seeing that the fee is still increasing. When soft block limit is increased the total transaction fee actually went down:
Besides, user growth is not infinite, it will reach an end at some point.

I think (1) is not yet implemented and I think Greg Sanders mentioned somewhere we won't see it anytime soon. Why? Because that requires a much larger change to the codebase, some of them are consensus critical. 
Sure, if you want to say "Hey, SegWit is better than P2SH so let's replace it!" then yeah, you can have less technical debt. But you can't because people will still need to make P2SH transaction. And you will also need to redo all the infrastructure necessary. You can probably do that in an altcoin. I would probably buy one if you manage to pull it off.
OTOH P2SH, with all its weakness is actually designed for this kind of script upgrade. So it is not a bad choice.


That also happens in hard fork. The difference is in soft fork "can't verify" node is protected by hashpower. So it is the choice of lesser between two evil.


Generally, yes (like extranonce setup). But in terms of SegWit, no (at least not much). Not much you can do unless you are willing to forego all the old style transaction.


I mean "future implementation". I got sloppy because you said you're ending the conversation.


If you "remove the ability to make old transaction" then you destroy old coin. If you don't support that then you shouldn't be making that argument.


[You **do** realize that FT still have a lot of TODOs right?]( Core devs consisting 10-20 devs, some of them has implemented SegWit as HF in Elements Alpha has already said that in the case Bitcoin SW as SF is the best we can do and Zander who doesn't even understand how Lightning works,and what nSequence does (and whose code is filled with buffer overflow) says otherwise without full working implementation?

@_date: 2016-12-15 12:54:29
Empty block means that they mine only based on the header, meaning they didn't validate the previous block and simply assume that it is valid. 
Because they never validate the block they can't tell which transaction already included in the previous block and thus can't include any transaction in the next block they mined fearing that it is already included in the prior block. 
Because they can't include transaction they cant reap the fee. If the fee made up a substantial portion of the mining revenue they will lose quite a lot.
@_date: 2016-12-09 11:27:50


Nuh,uh. It is up to the miners to **create** block, it is up to the node (with economical power) to determine whether it is **valid**, that includes the blocksize limit. Just like a node can say whether a &gt;21M BTC is invalid a node also have a say whether a &gt;1M block is valid.


But the network **will**, as evidenced by the orphan rate. It is not **sufficient** that your node keep up with the throughput, it **must** also contribute to the network by delivering the payload (e.g block) from miner to miner at a rate much faster than the one required to deliver block in 10 minutes. That means if the block time is 10 minutes,  you will need to deliver the block from miner to miner in 10s or less **through multiple hops** (because you are not the only one in the middle) so that miner can remain competitive with each other (otherwise the miner that first find a block has an advantage over another miner)
In addition to that new people who wants to bootstrap a new node will also need to catch up in a reasonable time. If it took you a year to catch up a year's worth of data you will never catch up with the rest of the network because as you are catching up the network already adds the same amount of data.
These means requirement for a full node is actually much more strict than it seems. A node actually must be 100x-1000x faster than the network so that it remains decentralized


I know I don't mind paying $30 to get a substantial amount of my salary for inflation-free assets, so does people in India who is paying $300/BTC more than most people. Most people in first world country with stable currency may not understand this but Bitcoin already has a killer apps.

Yes, and you think changing blocksize from 1MB to 2MB is not **rewriting large part of it**? Because the amount of change is not equal to the amount of lines of code changed.


What? How is that forced? Just do a hardfork to 2MB, and make all transaction with # of inputs=0 invalid (or change it to support other feature). 


False equivalency. See above.

@_date: 2016-12-05 15:51:05
The only way you can get 4 even for 50/50 case is if you don't simulate block propagation time, which even in the case of entire network being in consensus is non-zero (~15s?). In the case of emergence consensus I would expect it to be worse since everyone is doing Sybil on each other, so I don't think he actually simulates block propagation. Someone welcome to prove me wrong though. Edit: Actually even without simulating block propagation that doesn't actually makes sense. With 50/50 case there is zero probability that the minority chain exceed the big block at one point in time?
Also note that network splits into two is actually pretty optimistic case. [There are miners who puts AD as 6 or even 25 with EB ranging from 2 to 32MB](

By forcing everyone to upgrade? Nope. What if Satoshi never moves his coin? Are you going to destroy his coin? Destroy fungibility?


And I have yet read an argument on why it's not appropriate to use them in SegWit. Even you only speaks in general term without being specific

@_date: 2016-12-15 22:56:10


Actually back in 2013 orphan rates also skyrocket (the problem is now partially solved by relay network which is not an ideal solution since it is essentially a centralized solution) and yet I don't see anyone pushing for a smaller block. The approach that miner prefers is to put the entire hashrate into one single entity that is Ghash.io
@_date: 2016-11-28 11:40:07


Big difference. With 51% attack economic power would demand a hard fork because of network instability. A collusion to make centralization worse would be more subtle, some people probably support that seeing the amount of push for bigger blocks.


Again big difference. You are assuming that there is no competition between miners. Competition is what drives innovation. With this kind of scheme it is possible for 51% miner to bypass Bitcoin's equivalent of antitrust law by forcing the rest of the miner to fall in line.

I heard this from Mark Friedenbach himself. He puts it somewhere in the past. I need to dig it up but I don't think I have time for that.


UTXO and input costs more than witness. A LOT MORE. So the only way to make the damage minimum is to maximize witness (by virtue of greedy algorithm).
Of course you can tune the ratio better when you have sigops+utxo counting in the future but this is a starting point. I thought people want a band-aid fix?

@_date: 2016-12-16 16:43:16


[Ghash.io did this](
As a matter of fact I highly suspect they did selfish mining as well.
Even if they didn't doesn't mean they won't in the future. Artforz and Eleuthria never bother to cheat yet they didn't manage to stay in the game. Perhaps in the future miner would learn from their mistake and start to cheat. Even Jihan Wu says that he won't do validation because the protocol doesn't requires him to. Do you expect me to believe that he won't do double spend in the future because "the protocol allows him to do that"?


If I wanted to be "thankful" to anyone for the "privilege" I have been given to participate in financial system I would be using centralized system. Hell you could even give them rights to print more Bitcoin and call it "central bank".
Miner's sole job is to arrange transaction in chronological order and even then it is because there is no other choice. Everything else (21M BTC limit, cryptographic proof of ownership) can be done in trustless manner. You are crazy if you expect me to concede more power to them.
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:16:27


And this calculation would be as complicated as whether or not accepting a 0-conf tx. And all of the services that offers this kind of solution charges people fee for it. You actually expect someone to work this for free. Besides, All of this complication is for what? Politically palatable solution? There are better solutions out there. Hell, even Ethereum's vote-for-block size would work better than BU's let's orphan each other.
The worst part is this kind of solution is not yet ready and people still argue that BU is "totally tested"


That doesn't matter. I can just mine a single transaction without pre-broadcasting it. And the second conflicting transaction will only broadcasted sometime later after the block mined. I can still circumvent the limit.
@_date: 2016-12-14 21:48:01
A block that you can't verify on your machine. Ethereum is good example of that. They got attacked by someone who is producing a transaction people can't verify on a normal machine. This is solved by re-adjusting (e.g decreasing) their equivalent of block size limit.

Again, submit a patch if you think you have better fee model. This will produce significant complication since older tx is affected and SegWit tx is not.


We're talking about a full node, which by definition can be pruned.


You still can sync the old way by using torrent (which, also can be sharded) and verifying you're on the longest chain. You can even download from blockchain.info or coinbase.com. Pruning also gives you option how many GB data you want to reserve so you can store partial data (effectively sharding the past data).
Archival node is by no means necessary for the survival of the ecosystem.
On top of that, UTXO storage is in **memory**, eg. it is cached. So its storage cost is actually much higher than a normal storage How much more expensive is memory over SSD/GB?
 
I also noticed that you no longer mention processing so you agree that processing is limited by sigops?
Anyway, here's my point. Whatever the ratio is, it is more than 1:3, which is the SegWit discount (by a lot I might add). Doesn't matter if it is 1:10000 or 1:100. We are still being limited by the bandwidth.
Are you going to complain that you don't have 1/100th or 1/1000th extra for UTXO or input?
@_date: 2016-12-15 12:08:27
Actually the fact that they mine so many empty block means that they are not ready for the time when fee made up a substantial portion of mining revenue. Combined that with the fact that Antpool is the held most of the hashpower means that [they will reap the most benefit from bigger block](
Interestingly [according to this article]( Bitfury, CKPool, and BitClub Network doesn't mine empty block at all, meaning they would be more prepared when fee made up significant portion of mining revenue. All 3 of those pool are SegWit supporter.
This is why anyone that thinks miner could be trusted to oversee block size is really blind. Miner doesn't care about long term viability of the network. They only care about their own profit.
@_date: 2016-12-04 21:37:14


Which enables the following:
1. Fix malleability
2. Compact fraud proofs
3. Enable optional verification-less sync
4. Increase blocksize without worrying about an attack on UTXO
Now name one downside.


Everyone with a brain damage that is.
You would be insane if you think that a plain 2MB increase (I am not sure if this is the case for this hard fork, I wish there is a documentation on which feature they will support) will be any less controversial. A lot of people wanted to have block weight and dynamic limit for a starter.

@_date: 2016-11-28 23:03:01
Firstly, syncing node is UTXO-caching limited. So you need to consider UTXO growth vs memory. Secondly, blocksize should be limited by current technology, not future one.
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:31:24


**Precisely**. It is by **design**. This is why people are bad at adversarial thinking. I can design that tx such that it will be reversed after 6-conf with 100% guarantee. Remember, there will be no block rewards in the future. So if let's say block reward is less than 1M dollars I can make 3MB Block with 3MB transaction that will be orphaned after 6-conf with 1 output containing 1M dollars. My recipient is unaware, they accept that tx after 6 conf and finalize whatever deal they made. Surprize! that tx is no longer valid.


There is no way you can guess what kind of transactions is "big" because it will keep on changing. At some point someone will be bitten by this.


Uh, no. They never implemented that properly. That is the reason Classic-Unlimited fork in the testnet

A little bit difficult if you don't quote which part I'm talking about. If transaction fee goes up that means there is demand, and miner has been undercharging for a public goods. When there is no more growth fee will start to flatten (and probably go down, that's when we start to worry)

Ethereum's famous last words.
@_date: 2016-11-01 08:34:07


The reason Core has taken a strong stance against hard fork is because there is no urgency. Changing the 21M BTC limit, on the other hand is against the [fundamental principle]( of Bitcoin. As I've said before [it is not a false dichotomy]( Giving the control over blocksize limit is nearly equivalent to giving the control over the inflation.






In 2013 accidental fork it only took [6 hours]( to reach consensus so depending on urgency people can come together pretty quickly. I believe gathering more than 75% will take more than 6 hours.


That's what people are planning to do with ETC too. At that point ETC worth 10% of ETH yet nothing happens.


It is unpopular because there is no base for it. Miner is the most easily replaceable component of the ecosystem. Which one would people choose? The one committed to retaining 21M BTC limit or the one that don't? The one who committed to give right to everyone to run their own full node or the one that signs away the privilege to the miner? The one who gives support to more secure 0-conf(Lightning) or the one that don't (remember [Unlimited doesn't want SegWit](


You mean like how Core agrees to lower the 95% activation threshold? 
You **don't understand**. There's no such a thing as Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core is not a single unified body. That's why it took nearly half a year to reach consensus on SegWit. And SegWit itself has gone beyond Core, reaching various [wallets]( and [business]( 
Overall I agree with the sentiment of other posters in this thread. All of this is useless posturing. Either do it or don't. Talk only is useless. We'll see how good your hypothesis is when all the dust is settled.
@_date: 2016-12-16 04:14:16


Actually fee already made up around 5% of mining revenue right now. For some miner that is equal to their profit margin.

If you want to confirm that UTXO is bottleneck run two Bitcoin Core node, one with dbcache=100 and the other with dbcache=8192 (if you have &gt;8GB RAM) then sync from the start. There will be big difference in time required (at least if your computer doesn't have a hardware problem/slow network).
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:10:15


The chain with highest value (in terms of "market cap", developer support) is the BITCOIN. Miner follow the value, not the other way around. During ETC-ETH split miner's voice is split 65-35 but economy split (and developer support) is 90-10, at the end of the day the "market cap" split is 90-10. The 35 that doesn't support ETH just being drag around.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:05:58


How does SegWit matter here? Witness is always cheaper in terms of storage. It doesn't matter SegWit or no SegWit. The problem with older transaction is we can't count the witness separately (yet, not sure if there is any plan for that)


If Witness is 1000x cheaper than other data then you might as well treat it as infinite. There is not much difference. You should always consider worst case scenario.


You say processing, so you agree storage cost 0?
Which one do you think will hit the limit first sigops or witness?

@_date: 2015-08-04 21:13:02
I have spent some time here and over at and if you take a look at post history I've always tried to keep a balanced view.
The problem that I have with this work is that it spends too much time attacking Vitalik's [2] (which is arguably the weakest) and not spending enough time on [1],[3], and [4]. In particular [4] (there might be some problem on [1] and [3] as well but it is quite late here and I can't really think clearly). I believe misunderstands that the capital+reward is taken not only on an attack but also for misbehaviour. 
As an example during the last BIP66 SNAFU F2POOL didn't validate the previous block's header, the result is they(F2POOL + whoever mining there) are losing quite a fair bit on the reward but in the end they still survive because they still have the ASIC. This is not possible in the case of Caspermint because the protocol will allow their entire capital (e.g the deposit) to be taken away. As an effect they will immediately go bankrupt. So the punishment for behaving badly is much severe than PoW system.
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:06:30
Yup! That's why I think that if we are going to vote over blocksize limit it is better to use Proof of Stake (vote weighted by UTXO instead of hashpower).
One interesting thing of Bitcoin that's different than the traditional financial system is that economic majority no longer has total control over transaction inclusion/exclusion, because there is another power, namely the miner. If you can't send your Bitcoin through Coinbase you can now do it through the miner.
On the other hand currently miner has the most power over blocksize limit (e.g at least they can set a soft limit by now). I don't think it's a good idea to give them more power, because power tends to corrupt, so we can give the power to economic majority instead.
This way there is a balance, with miner/economic majority sharing the control over both transaction inclusion/exclusion and blocksize limit.
Edit: Ugh, downvote with no counterargument? Just to clarify I suggest that we still using PoW for creating block but PoS for blocksize limit voting so that like said


Reference 
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:07:54
No. Proof-of-Work requires you to find nonce such that sha256(block header of current block) &lt; certain value. If some miner produces a block &gt; 1MB its block header (which depends on a lot of things, including transaction included inside, and previous block header) would be different than block produced by other miner which is &lt; 1MB. Since miner in XT accept the first block, core's miner will reject it so they will be working on a different set of problem.


That's because namecoin note that originally was not designed to be merge-mined. The merge mining was only supported after a hardfork. 
Edit: ~~
Sorry, wrong link
 (hard fork at block 19200)
Likewise, Dogecoin (which was forked from Bitcoin) doesn't originally support merge-mining. I don't think there will be any interest in merge-mining XT since its purpose is to force miner to make a choice
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:45:05


Uh, no. It's not a claim when I supported it with links. Block size limit is a known bottleneck for a very long time. If the discussion started long time ago we would not be facing this situation.

The whole point of Bitcoin is everyone should be judged on the merit of their argument, and not their qualification.

Errr... Did you read the reference? How does that allow one to game the system? PoS simply means that if you have 1 BTC implies that you have vote weighted by 1/21 millionth.

@_date: 2015-08-23 22:27:34


No, they can't, unless the chain has been designed specifically to accommodate merge-mining. This will require a hardfork in itself. Take a look at dogecoin-litecoin merge as an example (hardfork at block 371337)
Edit: Just in case you are wondering why currently XT/Core mining is possible, it's because XT is setup to behave exactly like Core until a specific set of condition is achieved (75% vote + Jan? 2016). Once these conditions is achieved you can no longer mine on both chain.

That's a bad analogy. 1MB is not a brake, because brake is adjustable. If 1MB is a brake, it is an automatic brake that kicks in once we hit a certain speed (e.g 60km/h, sorry Americans). We can't win a race like this. Ethereum did pretty rigorous testing a few months back in Vitalik did mention that probably current Bitcoin can go up to ~10MB. 
From what I see the Ethereum Olympic seems to be a pretty good study of what the Network is capable of.
Maybe it is true that Gavin's proposal is equivalent to let's put the brake at 700km/h and let's hope that everyone plays nice, which is probably reckless. This is why the various flexcaps proposal is more attractive.
Here's the catch though. Can we actually expect the core devs to come up with something and not let the discussion die after a series of trolling like what happen in the past (actually even now I can see a lot of trolling in both in the mailing list and all over reddit)? I mean it is a little bit unfair that the Core Devs is expecting a better fee management from Wallet Developer while leaving the current 'brake' system intact.

@_date: 2015-08-23 19:38:24


Ugh, so many things wrong with this that I can't even...
First of all you can have a say, by running a full node (do you?). You can vote whether to accept 8MB blocks or not simply by choosing to accept or ignore the transaction through your node. You can even delegate this ability. Coinbase support 8MB chain and you want to support 8MB Blocks? Then buy your Bitcoin through them.


Miner is only responsible for transaction inclusion/exclusion. If you are talking about the 75% criteria then you can blame Gavin on that (and seriously you can even modify the Bitcoin Core to remove that criteria, or support other devs that has a better plan, for example Peter Todd has some idea about PoS voting on blocksize), but the truth is even with 75% hash rate it's meaningless unless you can get exchanges to support the change.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:11:44
Well, I don't imagine people would want to change block size THAT frequently. Once every 3-4 years would be reasonable. I think Peter Todd has a proposal where the voting key is different from UTXO key but I haven't read through it.
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:15:01


Agreed, a simply 8MB would have been more palatable. 
I think better alternatives are available, like Meni/Greg's flexcap that takes into account miner's vote + economic activity (e.g whether the increase required is justified by economic activity, and not simply malicious miner attempting to gain advantage) or Peter Todd's PoS voting, allowing anyone that owns Bitcoin to vote on blocksize but if consensus is required not even these changes will be incorporated into the Core (e.g. sipa's plan has been said to be too conservative, and Peter Todd's PoS has been said to be too complex). If these were to happen we will be in a stalemate (again!), in the meanwhile 1MB is creeping in.
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:32:20
Not really sure about but for me a good leader should unites and not divides. I can agree with his prior tweet, something along the line of both sides need to cool off (exaggerating their own point of view?) but this time around he really puts pro XT people over the fence. 
He doesn't seems to understand that many pro XT people is frustrated by the blocksize discussion's lack of progress over the year and wanted 1MB replaced, by high-way or by low-way. Personally I'd rather trust the miner rather than the unadaptable (arguably) low limit. 
I understand that there are a lot of better alternatives, but it is meaningless if it is not being incorporated into the Bitcoin Core. I mean take a look at Greg-Mike-Peter's exchange below:
 
It is almost to the tone of 'My Father is better than Your Father'. Like Nick's current tweet, it doesn't contribute anything to the blocksize limit. This is not the first time this kind of exchange happen and not in any way limited to these 3 people(this is just an example). I can understand a debate being political (although it is REALLY EXHAUSTING) but once it becomes personal it is hard to get out(short of people being a saint). You must have been one hell of an optimist to think these people will actually comes into consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:35:11
Here's the way I see it. 
Whenever Buttcoiner mocks Bitcoin for supporting only 7tps we always defend that the limit is artificial. The 2012 version of Bitcoin wiki even says so:
Guess who's laughing now.
Jeff Garzik has been pondering about the issue since back in 2013 
and everyone in consensus agree that it was not the time. So you guys procrastinated until Gavin/Mike threat you by releasing XT (or to be more exact 20MB discussion).
Seriously right now I see Core Devs as no better than US House of Rep during Debt Ceiling debate.
So probably you guys are 'not doing nothing' but seriously you are pretty close to come to 'doing nothing'.
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:11:30


Well, there is a cost to keeping miner honest. [4] means that in PoS it is cheaper to do this.


I am not sure. It just feels pretty intuitive to me (definitely not worth spending lots of paragraph and figures on it). This is my biggest gripe with PoS currently.
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:45:21
*facepalm* 
Nothing at Stake, also commonly called short-range-attack means that there is nothing preventing a stakeholder from voting on both chains if there's a fork, just to ensure they will get their reward. This means that the consensus is unstable. There is nothing 'old, outdated, and proved incorrect' about this. That's why normally there is 'punishment clause' in PoS system (I mean why would you need a counter-strategy when it 'proven incorrect'?). Of course this strategy is also not 100% effective since the stakeholder can just vote out the block that contains the 'punishment'. 
There is also long range attack, where attacker steals stakeholder's private key from the past and start rewriting the chain (since signing takes a little time he can catch up really fast to the current block height). This can be avoided by checkpointing, but this will lead into things settled offchain (e.g which checkpoints is the correct one?)
PoS is good for many things but unfortunately chain organization is not one of them, at least not if you want things to be settled within the protocol, and not outside.
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:23:12


Pray, tell me then. Why does the chinese miner choose 8MB over 20MB? I agree that there is a risk but the truth is the game theory is much more complex than that. There are people with high bandwidth and there are people with high hashrate, and these two groups may not have intersection. 


True. But are we going to keep 1MB forever? Because if we start hitting continuous 1MB blocks the network becomes unreliable (either you are dropping transaction or keep Bitcoin running until it ran out of memory, take your pick). And Bitcoin 'the store of value' is useless without Bitcoin 'the payment network', because that's all Bitcoin is useful for really. 1MB needs to go, and if we continue to do what we did from 2011 (yup, the debate has been going on that long), we will end up going nowhere.


AFAIK there is no one ever said that XT will achieve 'morning coffee' level of transaction. It is meant to buy time until better solution happen. I will repeat my point that I said several days ago, if the devs can have consensus on better block size strategy, that's great, but we will also need an insurance, which is what XT is all about.

This is political, some people like to have payment network with lower fee. They don't care about supply cap, etc. You realized that ironically you forced your will to these people right? The only way to resolve this is by a vote. 


Yet that is not the case right now. Are you saying Bitcoin has failed?


You're aware that you're getting into political area here right? Some people would disagree. They would like to be able to send money to Wikileaks without hindrance. A higher fee is a hindrance

Oh, I do have an idea. Take a look at my comment history for criticism on extension block. BlueMatt already spoke against it, so did Luke-jr. There is zero advantage of extension block over Segwit.


Now guess why Adam Back and Johnson Lau moves to work on Spoonnet/Segwit and leaving extension block in the dust. There is a reason for that.

These are the same 'cheap' transaction which small blocker don't want in blockchain. Besides, the proportion of censored legal transaction vs legal transaction is really small.  There is no chance it will compete with illegal transaction. Take a look at 'transferring money to Snowden/Assange'. That is considered illegal even if it should not be. If Bitcoin is only good for this government won't hesitate to shut it down
Edit: I just realized this. **Governments**, banks, credit card companies, Paypal are censoring completely legal transactions daily. Well that is the very definition of illegal.

And you're breaking 90% of the code ever written and risking that the new format has a flaw. What exactly would we gain?

It doesn't. That's why the fallback behavior during contention is to fall into status quo. Bitcoin still function even when Bitmain is lying.
However, it is generally considered a bad sport to have people running around trying to convince you that an upgrade is an improvement with minimal trade-off when the reason that they are so stubborn is because of conflict of interest.

Blocksize limit increase is a hardfork. Doing hardfork in emergency relief mode is practically a disaster in the making. The last time we had emergency relief during a fork is in 2013. During which time some whitehat manages to double-spend $10000:
Raising the limit needs to be done in planned way because everyone has to upgrade by the time the fork is finalized.

1. A hard coded constant will do just fine in terms of market voting. In fact a hard coded constant will perform better over miner-voted in terms of making sure 21M BTC limit retained
2. There is some work on sacrificing difficulty for bigger block (which only makes sense if transaction fee can cover for the difference). Edit: Not really sure on what is the progress on this

@_date: 2017-04-04 19:30:19


1. A 10x sig is still more expensive than a 1x sig
2. The discount is toward witness, that doesn't contribute to processing, storage, high-speed (memory) or low-speed (at least not with signatureless IBD)
3. UTXO bloat attack is still scarier than a witness bloat
4. People can take advantage of the discount for being altruistic (cleaning up UTXO set) or improve fungibility (Signature Aggregation)


People who upgrades benefit the network by using transaction that is not affected by quadratic hashing


Yeah, you can try to do that in the testnet with unlimited amount of fund. See if you can break it. (Hint: no, you can't, the discount factor is already calculated carefully)

Let's face it most of the use case for uncensorable transaction is a crime (even if it is 'victimless' crime like money laundering, buying drugs, or even circumventing capital control). If this is what constitutes most of the Bitcoin transaction government have more incentives to take down Bitcoin (and at the current size of Bitcoin let's not pretend that they can't do it, I mean even the traffic is unencrypted unless you are using TOR which if the case that will make even smaller block size limit to keep mining decentralized). The only way to make Bitcoin remain uncensorable is to get more lawful transaction inside Bitcoin, whether it is internet payment or remittance. That way government can't shut it down without raising public outcry.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:25:06


X is Segwit.
Here's what would happen in alternate timeline.
* Community starts demanding more capacity
* Core (or a number of developers) doesn't think it is neither necessary nor safe
* People stick with 1MB
* People HF to 2MB while Core deploys Lightning using malleability fix while at the same time decrease block size(either Segwit or Sighash single)
* Watch the other chain debate whether or not to increase to 4MB the next year
Segwit **is** a compromise. And this is coming from someone who has been fighting for a block size increase of more than a year:
(Thanks I've been trying to dig this information but I can't get past 9 months of reddit history)
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:18:01
KNC, Slush, and Bitmain do plan to support classic.
It's up to anyone's guess but personally I think the support for Core comes from:
1. Core still has the best expertise all around. 
2. They do promise an increase. If they actually say 'no we will not do an increase whatsoever' I think that's when shit actually hits the fan.
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:52:42
That means some people won't be able to use bitcoin network (on top of higher fee and longer confirmation times). 
Let's say right now the block is full, that means whoever is using Bitcoin (whether DNM, Coinbase, Bitpay, Rebit etc.) is already maximizing Bitcoin capacity. Let's say tomorrow Amazon starts accepting Bitcoin. That would mean additional demand but the supply remains constant. This would mean some of the on-chain transaction needs to get shafted somewhere else. People who normally uses Bitcoin (or going to) is no longer be able to do so. 
Fee will go up because of the bidding war for block space. Transaction that normally can go into block on the 1st block probably need to wait until 2nd or 3rd block because they are being outbid by someone else.
Most likely one of the first one to go is the micropayment, then low amount remittance, and it will slowly goes up the chain until only the very rich can transact on chain (worst case). 














Or the alternative is someone who was going to use Bitcoin uses something else more cost-competitive because the block is too full. While this is probably not enough to kill Bitcoin it will probably damage the momentum that Bitcoin already has going.
Sure, you can go offchain but then you are already relying on third party. In the future there will probably be Lightning Network to offload the transaction onto but unfortunately it will not be ready anytime soon.

@_date: 2016-02-29 04:38:54


In the current state of hard-coded rule we will need to do a fork every time we increase/decrease the limit(soft for decrease, hard for increase) this has led to inflexibility/deadlock whenever we want to adapt. Are you saying you are against any kind of flexcaps?


I'm not really sure what kind of democracy you are talking about. I wonder how many people actually wants QE/negative interest rate to be implemented. Or having any say in economic policy in general.


Treat any 'abstain' vote as a status quo. That way it behaves similar to the current hard limit (note that only single transaction needs to get inside the blockchain while inside the voting period, I'm not sure how effective can the miners be at doing this)
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:45:16


1) Because in the long run blocksize limit is required to ensure 21M BTC limit.
2) Right now blockchain grows at 50GB/year. If it increases by 2MB it grows by 100GB/year. 4MB it grows at 200GB/year. That means at 4MB I will need to upgrade my computer earlier than I used to (5 years), and that is assuming that I kept all the 1TB drive free.
3) 4MB was also happened to be the limit at which the network can remain decentralized. 
4) UTXO at 1MB is growing faster than the memory growth
5) Already people are having trouble running a full node.
6) If Bitcoin can't resist pressure from a 1Billion dollars company (at best) it won't stand a chance from a state actor (which might even play a part right now) 


You have better chance with Lightning than that.

In general payment routing is slightly trickier than network routing. In network routing shitty route imply disconnect and reroute, all within second. In LN routing shitty route means locked fund. There probably needs to be some sort of reputation system.

Actually the increase in fee in July is due to stress test: 
so it actually corresponds to a simulation of what happen when the blocks is full (also note that we are talking about attacker with limited fund, when we are talking about real world demand everyone is an attacker and there is unlimited fund so the effect will be worse).


This will no longer be the case after 0.12 (actually can you show me where zero fee tx are being processed without delay? because there is a post in front page saying that at 0.0001 BTC/kb it is still not getting confirmed so definitely there is conflicting information)

Agreed. UI part is really tricky.


1. Have a bunch of people who supposedly know more than you decide what is the best? How is that any different than how Federal Reserve work?
2. The current debate is proof that there is a disconnect between Core developers and the users. AFAIK there was no agreement on how to increase block size until Gavin made that mess a year ago. We need some sort of signaling mechanism between the user and core developer.


Let's limit this to block size shall we?


Agree to disagree then. I want a censorship resistant money that everyone can use, even if it means compromising. I think the current 2017 timeline is good enough, not everyone is happy but all can live with it. I, for one, however would like to have to deal with less mess and personal attack that currently happen if possible. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:04:37


Mostly because I think they are too competent to realize that that proposal has zero percent chance of being passed. Matt Corallo already made criticism in the past and even two of the ideas originator already abandoned the idea in pursuit of something else. That doesn't happen without a reason.
Similarly they seem to go out of their way to disable segwit on mainchain. There are ways to make extension block work with Segwit (like sidechain)
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:08:14
No, it isn't. That is a common misconception. Segwit's block that contains 2x transaction will still need 2x bandwidth to propagate.

Those plans depend a lot on
1. Data gathered from Segwit activation
2. Covert ASICBOOST being disabled (weak blocks, IBLT, fraud proof, TXO commitment etc.)
How about Bitmain support (2) if they don't want to support (1) to show good will? For all we know of most likely the next hard fork plan will be opposed for silly reason like 'Segwit discount' while the actual reason is to protect covert ASICBOOST.

No block size limit debate has never been purely technical. makes a good explanation about that here:
 Even the 1MB limit is arbitrary. There was never any testing before deciding that number whatsoever. Even for technical decision there is always a trade off that there is no black and white answer for. Example: weight-strength trade off in construction.

Core is not a single unified entity. No one can promise you any timeline without consensus. Even timeline for Segwit is obtained only after consensus is made.

What other matters? Just in case you didn't remember After Gavin brought up blocksize debate and small blocker was paralyzed, unable to come up with anything for about 9 months until Segwit comes out. Even then people seems to underestimate the effort required to reach consensus.


You know what being open source means?


The only thing they're currently in unanimous consensus about is Segwit. Spoonnet? Being debated. Luke-jr's proposal? Still being debated. UTXO commitment? Still being debated. When people can't stand the heat of debate of course they are being shown the door.


Yeah, let's just ignore the fact that they're not immune to criticism
Surely you would know that, since you're here since 2011 right?
Also let's forget about Adam Back's extension block proposal, which has also been rejected.


The ones who has openly stated their opinion. Now guess why not many people want to speak openly.

The main objection over BU is miner's control, not the amount of increase. I'm not even sure how you're going to appeal to big blocker now..




No compact block support and no Segwit support. LOL. At least they need to replace xthin you know? That is totally borked.

So you're saying Charlie intends to break that promise if there is a pushback from the community? And sets off another Litecoin Core dev breaks promise shit later?

You **are**. Upgrade to Segwit or your coin made invalid
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:34:06
This was the original point of contention:
Old outputs will still be affected by malleability unless you figure out a way to make BIP62 works. There's not much difference between SWSF and SWHF.
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:24:21
But old nodes will still see the input and the output. This means that bitcoin is still fungible. Every nodes still verify every input goes to the next output (although it is visible as anyone-can spend). This is not the case with extension block (unless you want to make extension block compulsory, which is no better than a hard fork) where some part of the economy is totally invisible to the old node. Now you have two classes UTXO, the one stored by old node, and the one doesn't. (Ironically this is one of BU supporters objection to Segwit, although it doesn't actually have two classes of UTXO)
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:03:05


No, it is not required. Fee market will just price out some people. 
Also, I forgot to comment about this part:


What happen when the community doesn't want an increase? Is Charlie going to force it through?

Now let's say this is my only use case for Bitcoin(getting paid weekly to explain for the recurring part so I spend some part of it on let's say drugs, or remittance). Let's say I don't use it for anything else. Why would I open channel anywhere else?

That's not what Spoonnet is. That is different from Luke-jr's proposal.


Because they already reaches consensus when the timeline comes out.


Then fork away.


They aren't supposed to. If the big block community wants to reach consensus they will work with Johnson Lau and address all the objections as they arise. If they don't they can start planning for a fork now.
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:19:54
Mostly same criticism as BU
1. No wipeout protection
2. No replay protection
3. No quadratic hashing protection
4. No UTXO bloat protection
Also take a look at Meni Rosenfeld's criticism here


They're just rehashing all the old rejected proposals. Extension block, and now this (and they don't even attempt to hide their effort to protect ASICBOOST lol)
At least the chain might converge though, however it is the same team that develops BU so most likely it is still a shitchain

I think when Lightning first released this is generally a good idea to follow (irregardless of how the routing will be) since it is semi-experimental after all. Hopefully as the technology matures we can start to entrust more to it.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:23:38


No. The way to prevent that is to incentivize people to make a normal transaction (1 input 2 outputs) or clean-up transaction (3 inputs 2 outputs) over abnormal transaction (1 input 17 outputs). Multiple payments can be routed over Lightning instead.
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:57:18


What makes you certain that the implementation that doesn't crash and burn is not accepting invalid block in the same scenario? Multiple implementations is good for audit purpose in the early stage of protocol development but in the real world you are supposed to run behind "one" code (or at least run all of the implementations and raise alarm if one of them fails)
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:58:21
Still a little bit naive I think. Bitcoin block size limit has never been fully a technical discussion. It is partly a political one. For example this point:
 &gt;In most cases the min spec is based on entry model machines that are available during launch
While it is quite obvious that you can deal with this sort of thinking in game-dev(of course company want to make profit) you can't just straight away port this into Bitcoin. Some people would like full node to be ran only in server-grade hardware to support higher tps, others would like more people to verify the blocks while sacrificing tps. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:28:36


At least LN doesn't attempt to invalidate community's work for the last 1 year or so. Not to mention that we hear it firsthand from you and Tadge yourself. Did you seriously not foresee this reaction?


Not just to the press. To Wang Chun and to whoever leaks to Samson Mow. The first thing I think about when I heard about this was how to create a competing soft fork to invalidate this new vector of attack. How do I know you are not in cahoot with Jihan? He is wandering around promoting BU now. Are you saying that this is just a coincident? Together with Sergio's 2MB?


Normally there's a BIP before things get out to the press.


What timeline? Someone gave you a deadline? Like Jihan? You are not really thinking this through. The manufacturer of 70% of ASIC in market just attempted a coup. People are in high tension all around. Even if your proposal is good (I don't think it is) people will be turned off.

NO. 21M BTC limit is more important than NC. Preventing coin confiscation is more important than NC. Even block size is more important than NC. NC doesn't even come to play during the split I mentioned above. Proof-of-Vitalik does.

@_date: 2017-04-01 22:39:33
Some people think 1MB is already too big. If Segwit is rejected it is more likely the block size increase part will be removed instead in the next proposal.
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:45:47
Let's talk about planning then. When you mention that we are **not at that stage** did you calculate the buffer time for pre-planning? Because extrapolating from
Block size roughly double every year since ~2012, so even with success of SegWit we'll probably need to do hard fork at least sometime in 2017. Ideally I'd prefer that we have 1 year of grace period. What's your ideal grace period? Or are you one of those people who prefers stunting growth?
I support Core's roadmap and I understand that they will probably need to evaluate the effectiveness of SegWit/IBLT/Weak block before hard fork but they will need to do so ASAP.
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:18:30
What change?
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:17:48
1. That only makes sense if only collaborators knew about the proposal beforehand (Poon, JJ, Stephen Pair, Fedor). The list of people who knew about the proposal beforehand includes Wang Chun, whoever leaks to Samson Mow (which can only be explained by an attempt to secure miner support beforehand), and Forbes (only can be explained as PR attempt). That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works.
2. If I were you I would lay low now. You are either a puppet or a an accomplice:
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:12:41
1) That means they ignore this 7 months old issue:
2) When you are talking about money incompetence and malice will produce exact same result.
3) We are talking about the same shady groups of people who just purposefully delayed shipping Litecoin miner just for the purpose of delaying Segwit and threaten to 51% attack a minority chain. If you believe there is no malice involved I have bridge to sell you.

Are you talking about maintainer? If yes,
1. None of them attend HK meeting

3. Maintainers are janitor, not leader.
@_date: 2016-02-26 06:11:54


Eh, I actually mentioned routing


The original whitepaper mentioned 'super node' that is comparable to tier 1 ISP. But this can be easily regulated. Blockstream mentioned they already solve this but I have yet to see the whitepaper. I consider decentralized routing would be pretty hard to solve


Well that would depend how high of payment. Let's say you have $50 weekly recurrent payment. Do you use on-chain or LN? LN would require $50x4(4 weeks)x6(6 month) =$1200 locked up inside the channel for 6 month. Do you have this kind of fund? If you use on-chain how much fee do you expect to pay?

Nakamoto consensus doesn't apply to different consensus system. If Alice pay Bob is a valid tx in one client but invalid in another Nakamoto consensus can't resolve the difference. This is a concrete example:
In this case Bob and Charlie are miners (two different miners accept coinbase for the same block according to two different clients). You can have Proof-of-Vitalik in case of Ethereum but not in the case of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:24:53
I'm going to be honest with you. It is really difficult.
1. It is not clear what the proposal aims to achieve, replace Segwit? Does the contributor unaware of extension block criticism that makes the idea abandoned?
2. I'm not sure what could be gained by informing miner prior to everyone else. In fact I would hope this will never happen again in any kind of scenario. This just sets up a really dangerous precedent, especially in soft fork scenario. I hope this never happen again, **ever**
3. Similar with Forbes, in fact this reminds me of the time Bitcoin Unlimited attempt to fork. They called the news media first.
4. The scenario just happen to benefit Bitmain, really? If anything I would be suspicious that one contributor is not telling everyone the whole story.
5. Add to that the Bitcoin Development Grant circumstances and you will no longer certain what is happening.
In other words, sorry but I don't think you can convince me otherwise. Perhaps just bad luck (but really, it takes everything to align perfectly for this to happen)
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:27:27


People who thinks that SWHF is good but SWSF is bad is in very tiny minority. 


Even he himself later does a perfect 180 degrees:


So which one is it? Is it technical debt or is it not? Or he just simply trying to help Jihan hiding ASICBOOST. Which one is more plausible.


Except there AXA conspiracy doesn't offer this level of circumstantial evidences.


So you're saying Bitmain produces Antminer with AB at extra silicon space, applying for Chinese patent, proven to be working by multiple peoples, saying that SWHF is good but SWSF is bad, pushing for extension block, pushing for 2MB+SW, refusing to implement soft fork to disable AB, producing empty block at higher occurence than any other miner **for no reason at all**? I think said this better than me:
@_date: 2017-04-20 07:22:36


There's no such a thing as "Core". There is only individual contributors to an open source project. "Core" is not run as a top-down management where people at the top can order people at the bottom. Each individual contributor needs to reach near-universal agreement on what is being merged. Likewise, they also need to take into account what the community want (I wouldn't be surprised if anonymous whale-eater like Loaded in Bitcointalk already convinced some of the contributors that they will continue the old chain)
"Core" doesn't sign the agreement, only a few individual signs the agreement (possibly under duress). These individuals have no power over what is being merged into "Bitcoin Core". In fact when they signed the agreement they receive the same treatment like what is being received by bcoin team when they released extension block proposal. Even so, the way I see it each of them still persevere even though Antpool is running Bitcoin Unlimited and F2Pool is running Bitcoin Classic. Johnson Lau is still working on spoonnet and Peter Todd is still working on TXO commitment (which is probably will also be blocked because it is incompatible with ASICBOOST)
Personally I think HK agreement is now moot since Antpool is already running Bitcoin Unlimited and F2Pool is already running Bitcoin Classic.

Ah, I see your point now, a hard-number-only requirement for the current Bitcoin operating at maximum capacity. I think most of them is already available, just needs a compilation, OpenSSL capacit) is on the wiki, storage capacity can be easily extrapolated, sipa covers networking side, etc.

@_date: 2017-04-04 17:06:34
At the very least is the dynamics is already more or less understood. P2SH is deployed the same way. You can't say the same about extension block, where the old nodes can't see some of people's UTXO.

That means anyone who uses Segwit tx pledges loyalty to Core chain. I don't see anything bad with that. UASF is nearly equivalent to Segwit as a Hard Fork. Miners can choose whether or not they want a split chain (be reminded that as is, the original chain can be wiped out if UASF hashrate exceed that of the original chain). 
Also note that even if Segwit is implemented as a hard fork it will still be anyone-can-spend. The replay protection will exist outside Segwit.

Unless I get this one wrong it seems like I won't get Segwit on the main chain. That's a big NO-NO. By disabling Segwit on the main chain you will not be getting script upgrade capability. You won't be getting signatureless IBD either.

I see. Apparently they made an update to the older proposal (Dated Dec 2016). Again, that is still inferior to Johnson Lau's sighash estimate. You can fit more than 50000 normal sized transaction 224 bytes over a single 1000000 bytes transaction. Counting bytes is pretty stupid.

The fact that Geth decides to roll over and not scrutinize Parity enough says something about the decision process. When you have decentralized decision making you do a fact check over everything the other party says. If you have "whatever" attitude you already bow down indirectly.


Why not a rollback? That's the most technically correct solution. Or for that matter why not a shutdown in the first place?
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:19:10
You think there's not enough awareness? Or that rbtc isn't loud enough yelling all-you-can-spend? You can start spreading the word. But either way they will have to go out of their way by a lot to get conned. Not to mention that the original chain can be easily wiped out if there's no protection.

@_date: 2017-04-27 21:37:36


If the client developers bows to you everytime it reduces to Proof-of-Vitalik. I mean Parity has bug, Geth has bug. Why does Parity has higher precedence? Geth developer should fight for a rollback instead. Why, instead of letting the chain shutdown while the cause of split being determined people choose to run Parity instead?


The devs asked the exchanges and the miners (with the exchange, especially Mt.Gox, having bigger says). They don't decide between themselves. That's why 0.7 have higher precedence over 0.8, although 0.8 is the technically correct one.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:15:24


1MB is still a problem with UTXO bloat when you don't have a full block. Rather than extension block HF is still a better approach. All of this squabbling really doesn't help when
1. Segwit is still a better option
2. There's already an effort on Spoonnet where people can contribute instead of muddying the water
3.The extension block idea works better as a sidechain

Yes, but now you're making it more likely to happen on extension block because it will be empty. Once that happens people will be reluctant to run validation on extension block
1. No, Segwit is technically better. You can't achieve signatureless IBD with extension block. You also break fungibility in worse way than Segwit
2. Rather than working together towards a better solution these guys try to invalidate something that people have been working on for the last year. And no, segwit and extension block is not compatible


It's not good enough for me. I'd rather have a chain split rather than have working on a solution that is neither ready nor technically better

Every bidirectional channel includes two users. So while every transactions between these two won't need to happen outside channel, every transaction that needs to be done with other party will need to happen inside other channel. That would require opening other channel. Opening channel will require on-chain transaction. Routing can solve this but apparently routing problem in Lightning is not yet solved.

How they charge fee for example. Charging fee per kb has never made sense. This requires additional complexity(e.g max sigops, max block size, max transaction size to prevent quadratic hashing, SegWit charging more for tx that creates more UTXO etc.) to prevent DoS. OTOH Ethereum only has gas limit and stack depth limit (which could probably be rolled into gas limit in the future? IDK).
Using Turing complete script also makes it easier to develop compiler for. Creating compiler for Bitcoin script is not that straightforward. You could argue that using high-level language is not putting you in proper mindset for creating smart contract but I personally find it interesting to see what kind of smart-contract people creates if the barrier of entry is lowered.

And why is that? You want to trim as much fat as you can from your operation. If you can run mining node with pruning you should. The majority of expenses should be on mining hardware.
At this point in time unpruned node needs 97 GB. HDD costs per gigabyte chart already plateaued. 
In the future if the blocksize continue to increase there will be time when you need to upgrade drive every year or so.

Actually nSequence was broken before, and RBF is the fix.


No, the risk is still the same. Opt-in RBF is far more transparent option in double spending. Other options are less easily detectable


This won't happen unless wallet suddenly adds RBF feature, which would be stupid.


Wallet should handle the complexity, not the user.


No it is not worse than it already is.

As far as I know no one has created GUI for RBF. It is RPC-only. So people still need a command line to do RBF. Unless wallet software started adding this feature (which they should do at precaution) everything will work the same.

You do understand that SegWit is a response to a block size increase request right? My impression is that Core Dev would prefer to work on project that improve on fungibility/scalability rather than throughput, like Schnorr or UTXO commitment. Prioritization on SegWit is a major compromise from their side.


Yeah? Like what? Do you consider LinkedIn, Yahoo, Ashley Madison, Target, Home Depot bug free? Because the recent hack shows that they're not. These are centralized system, so a bug is more forgivable. In decentralized system like Bitcoin once there is a bug the consequences are catastrophic. Ethereum just learned this the hard way.


If you think that changing block size is a "relatively small enhancement" you couldn't be more wrong Mr. Project Manager. The Unlimited-Classic fork in testnet is the proof. Luckily someone actually made the attack in testnet. Now Classic quietly remove the safety feature just because Unlimited is gaining market share.

Because anonymity, like transaction throughput, is often times at odds with decentralization due to higher resource usage. UTXO growth is bad enough as it is. With Monero-style ring signature we need to keep TXO on top of UTXO. Better anonymity means nothing if the state actor can enforce a whitelist.

You're not having the whole picture. Miner needs to compete against each other. For this to happen blocks need to be transferred near instantaneously. If we need the entire 10 minutes required to discover the block just to move the block between miner the original miner has a significant advantage over the other. (If this were done intentionally it is called block witholding attack but in this situation the effect is unintentional). Current safe range for blocksize to increase is from 2MB-8MB depending on whom you quote from but it is nowhere near 375MB/block
Tech like compact block or xthin can reduce the number of data to be transferred when block is found but we still need to evaluate their effectiveness.

Some pools like Slush and F2Pool ran BIP91 exclusive code (and most likely has already started some evaluation to switch back to 0.15/0.14 after it was ensured those compatible with each others). No one in their right mind would actually continue to run code filled with bit-rot. 
Segwit doesn't stand alone, it requires things like Lightning/MAST/Signature Aggregation to take full advantage of it and none of the people who knew how to implement them stand with NYA. At this stage Segwit 2x is practically a chain without Segwit. Even BCH is more competitive than Segwit2x.

@_date: 2015-09-22 01:20:58
Actually it is a little bit more nuanced than that. The thing is at the test chain's stress test they put targeting part of Bitcoin's equivalent of blocksize limit (gas limit) at a really large number (miner vote on valid gas limit, I think they are hitting somewhere around 20-25 tx/s at some part of the test). Most miner doesn't bother to set soft size limit, much less attempt to target lower gas limit, because it is a stress test after all (and the fact that codebase is in Go probably doesn't help). So as an end result there is a centralization seen. All in all, I believe that it is a good experiment, just to see how much centralization one can observe by changing the block size.

Personally I believe that there is a sweet spot where the uncle reward is low enough that most people will prefer to remain on the main chain instead of aiming for the uncle and yet still give enough incentive to secure the chain. It remains to be seen if Ethereum has already reached this sweet spot


Selfish mining is always profitable, even in Bitcoin yet you don't see anyone do that. Perhaps we pay too much attention to that? Most miners are honest/lazy. Even now I wonder what will the Core Devs do if some miner actually attempt selfish mining.


There is economic incentive since people are getting rewarded for mining blocks, there is also special reward most blocks mined.


That paper doesn't rebuke my observation. Fact is Bitcoin is more decentralized when CPU mining was still a thing. On the other hand let attempt to rebuke that paper. 


The point is moot. A good PoW should be the one that is close to thermodynamic limit when it is mined using tools most commonly available to men. If there is a PoW that can be mined using dirt at thermodynamic limit then it is an ideal PoW.
Just to give an illustration, let's say someone attempt to 51% the network where CPU mining is still competitive. In this case every Bitcoin user can rally to defend the network using their laptop, PCs, etc (even though normally they don't mine). This is not the case in the current ASIC situation.


Actually the paper provides counter argument to that in [9]


Which is what partly inspires Ethereum's PoW


PoW doesn't have to be totally ASIC-resistant. It just has to limit the advantage ASIC has over off-the-shelf hardware. If ASIC is just ~5x more efficient than let's say GPU, GPU mining is still pretty competitive because of its accessibility and miner might have advantage in other area, like electricity. Besides that someone can easily do non-competitive mining.


At GB size memory, DRAM is the most cost effective solution, and it is a commodity, meaning it is available to everyone. Litecoin's scrypt failed because it is meant to make CPU-mining competitive by designing the PoW such that it runs in CPU cache, which is fine and dandy until someone design an ASIC with lots of SRAM in it.

I think there's an easier way to get there. Now there is double-count that happens. Let's say received the loan of $100 and give it to the person he buys the car from. Note that this money comes from the depositor. The question is who owns $100? The depositor or the 'car person'? 
The worse part is yet to come. This car person might actually store the amount in the bank again which is then used again to lend people money and more double count happens.
Assuming minimum proof of reserves of 10% and bank actually used all of them up, with original $100 in deposit you could end up with 100+90+81+72.9+... = ~10x of the original amount circulating

Actually your source agrees with mine that a slowdown is happening:
 (see all the x)


Actually it is in the best of interest of big miner to do this as this is one kind of selfish mining. Remember if you control a higher amount of hashpower (~20%) it is more likely that you will find the next block before your competitor (whose block will also need to travel)so it is better if you can arrange it such that your competitor doesn't get your block too soon.


Their solution is to depend on someone mining another block to save their bacon. Which is pretty stupid since you can actually cleverly create a block that won't get orphaned and still take a large amount of time to verify.

Then explain why Ethereum lower their block size when they are under attack? That's because it is more expensive to attack when the block size is low. Your hypothesis has a real world counterexample.


Which unlimited has none. SegWit fixes that without crippling the transaction.

@_date: 2016-10-12 13:54:35


Precisely. There is a separate limit for a signature just because that it is safer to expand on that side.
Classic's approach on this issue is to limit the number of bytes/transaction but I think this approach less preferable than that of SegWit because like I said not all bytes are created equal.


No problem. I am just hoping I can bring back unity.

Which actually fits Terbium really well.
Boring Grey in color
Malleable so that it can be cut with a knife
Not a good conductor in electricity resistivity (1.15x10^-6 Ω·m), compare that to materials commonly used in electronics copper (1.68×10^−8 Ω·m), Tin (1.09×10^−7 Ω·m), Lead (2.20×10^−7 Ω·m), Tungsten (5.6×10^−8 Ω·m)
In fact citation in Wikipedia that specify its uses only exists after 2000.

Actually I have read [Rusty's series of summary on Lightning Network]( and I **do** feel that it is complicated, perhaps because I'm not that smart. It really feels like something that is hacked together to make something works in what Bitcoin is not designed to do. The explanation sounds like, OK, so we want to do A so we do B, but it doesn't cover use case C so we do D, We also have to cover for edge case E so we do F, etc. At the end of the day I was left wondering whether it will really work. The other time I feel the same way is when I read [Vitalik's Slasher Ghost](
In contrast it seems like Bitcoin, Cryptonote's whitepaper, and [your CT]( is more straight forward. We want to achieve A so we do B, and you do get the general feel of how it works. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:49:45
Actually they did tinker with non-outsourceable puzzle for a while. But because of Vitalik's affinity with Proof of Stake most of the idea is getting discarded. Vitalik himself said that PoW is just a placeholder until PoS is in place, and if he were to start over he would just use SHA3 as a PoW. Which is quite sad since I'm leaning towards PoW myself.
Personally I think most of the miner in the pool never tried doing solo mining because from my experience it is actually far more profitable to solo mine.

I don't think you are reading my assumption correctly. 
Let's say when ETH vs ETC fork ETH is actually under PoS.
Now staker can mine ETH while at the same time destroying ETC.


Yes, this is my case. Under PoW ETC can still survive without any HF. With PoS you are lowering the requirement for hard fork (quite significantly too I would say).
Edit: HF is also required under long range attack.

You want to make a choice? Just design a Bitcoin fork with # of inputs=0 invalid. There, now you can choose between SegWit soft fork and your own soft fork.
Alternatively Bitcoin Unlimited can make 2MB block, then all can choose themselves what to support.


I have yet to hear an argument why hard fork is a proper solution.


You forgot that deploying soft fork is much faster than deploying hard fork.




So you disagree with that? Then it's okay. Apparently we don't have consensus. We will just stick with 1MB limit for the time being. You are crazy if you think just by blocking the soft fork you can force other miner to suddenly make 2MB block. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:19:11
Replace by fee is a pretty ugly solution. You will need to resend the tx every time it is not getting confirmed. It is a nightmare for usability. 
IMO Ideally block should be ~70-80% on average (hitting 100% only during peak). We can have fee market working at that utilization with tx with higher fee getting confirmed faster (within 1 block vs within 3 blocks).
@_date: 2016-10-12 14:58:29


On the contrary it would be more difficult. We should expect the protocol to ossify as time goes by. As adoption grows, so does the difficulty of coordinating a fork (so does the risk of doing so).


Based on the whitepaper?
Actually several PoC is around:
Lightning actually depends on SegWit, not the other way around. So you need to have SegWit before you have Lightning. (well actually you can have Lightning without SegWit only that it is more annoying to develop).

Unlike P2SH, major wallet developer has pledged to support SegWit from the get-go:
Let's face it if adoption is slow, that would be because no extra capacity is needed.
If you want to hard-fork you might as well do major reform like block weightage or remove fee/kb (which is one of the reason others are reluctant to increase block size) and replace it with something more sane.

You do realize that most SegWit effort is done by Johnson Lau, Suhas Daftuar, and sipa right? GMax is responsible for reviewing afaict. And that means pondering a lot. Sometime a security issue that was never seen before pop up just like that.

Let me remind you that a substantial portion of the community supports SegWit, including [Andreas Antonopoulos]( [Erik Voorhees]( and [various wallet]( has supported SegWit. And all the Lightning Development so far has been done on SegWit. [This is the same SegWit that Unlimited refuse to merge previously]( So by activating Bitcoin Unlimited I can consider that you have acted against the community.
This is not to mention the fact that [block size limit is crucial by the time that block reward goes to 0]( That means there is no guarantee that you will be able to keep the 21m Bitcoin limit promise.
Also changing PoW is not the only solution we can also adjust the difficulty manually (although I'm not too sure which would be the more preferable solution seeing that if we change PoW you have two hostile miners, BTCC and BitFury on your side, we will see if Unlimited's claim that "quadratic hashing is not an issue" really holds well).

That is not a concern as long as the node is still running. The attacker still lose money after all.

Vulnerability is the same no matter what the mechanism is. Lower block size=more expensive to conduct. 


What do you think will happen to the transaction fee when block size goes up? It goes **down**. And attacker can still fill it with lower fee.


No, it is by **design**, not a side effect. The reason the increase is so small is because by increasing non-signature part of the transaction you are increasing attacker's space on most vulnerable part of the transaction (input and output)

For 1/3rd original capacity for a month, 1/8th original capacity for 3 days and even now it is still less than one-half its original capacity with people complaining their node unable to sync. Not to mention miners refusing to put tx into the block. Well, I guess I know what your "everything is fine standards now". No wonder you disagree with my grave assessment.


Yes, and what is the expected 3-4 blocks reorg probability under Unlimited? And what assumption do you make?


Are you conflating RBF with doing RBF because of full block? Because those two are separate concepts


And RBF tx is explicitly labeled it is RBF.


So that means you are OK with RBF? Because by extension 0-conf is no longer secure either.
Besides, 3-4 conf? How much node setting fragmentation do you assume? I'd like to see a real study on that.

How is that different? People are free to change them without any discussion.


That's what causing lost revenue and network instability. You can game 1 conf or even 2 conf during this period.

While blocksize initially looks like DoS limit for bandwidth it also actually serves as DoS limit like other things like storage (UTXO) and processing (quadratic hash) so if we increase that limit we also need to put a substitute for storage DoS limit and processing DoS limit. 
And the DoS limit for these two doesn't scale linearly with blocksize limit.

Congestion is not an attack. Full node running out of memory/ crashing because of high processing/high I/O is an attack


1. The transaction fee is no longer 0.001btc if you make the blocks 4x bigger. 
2. Ethereum's situation shows that lower block size favors the honest person more than an attacker


One need only to study Ethereum's case study to shows that evidence point the other direction
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:49:48


Well, the other option (hard fork) is everyone left them and they are left vulnerable to someone doing sybil and rent a hashpower to fake a 6-conf. I'd rather rely on herd immunity than the pack leaving the wounded alone.
As for being second class, well they can capitalize if actually manage to pull it of so it is a fair deal.
@_date: 2016-10-24 14:31:36


And the attacker can pay a little bit more too (hint: it is still cheaper than when the block is full)
And what if the attacker creates a block that crashes a full node? When you are using pure block size limit this is actually possible. Ethereum economy is practically crippled.


Attacker lose money doing this. He won't be able to sustain it. That's why all the time attacker did this to Bitcoin in the past he always stopped (and never tried again for nearly half a year). Ethereum's attacker OTOH is still going at it today.


Like I said Ethereum provides counterexample to this. If the block is not full there is not enough demand to compete with the attacker.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:43:43


I don't think that's true. Remember the reason people can't say anything about money supply is because they don't have any say over it. Take away people's ability to run full node and you take away their power.

So it is only a single case right? An anecdote? And you don't believe me? You need to study why Ethereum needs to lower down their block size limit. Because block size limit is pretty shitty as a DoS prevention. Sure we will need to HF in the end but first we how to replace the block size limit.
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:19:23


Basically what it does is when a full node sees a block at height n it can force whatever transaction it made to be mined only at block n+1 so that miner have an incentive not to orphan block n (because otherwise they can't include that transaction).

I just don't think people understand what Bitcoin Unlimited proposition is. They intend to change consensus rule on-the-fly and claiming it will just work. Which is fucking insane. ETH/ETC fork prove that it won't work, Bitcoin's block size debate prove that it won't work. There will be a split. 100% guarantee.
On top of that there will be a network instability and lost revenue. I don't understand how anyone could support that kind of chaos.
@_date: 2016-10-25 08:28:58


Yes but the fee is very low if the block is not full.


But it **is**. The higher the block size the easier it is to play with the parameter to crash the node. For example the higher the block size the more processing power you need, the more memory you need, etc.


Bitcoin prices has continuously increased alongside the fee. The thing is there is demand for non-censorable asset transfer and judging from the people's willingness to pay it is still too cheap. 


That's where you went wrong. It **will not**. Because if the block size goes down the fee also goes down (unfortunately same thing applies to regular customer and attacker). Here, let me show you some figure. In 2013 the block size was capped at 250kb. Mike Hearn asks miner to increase the blocksize:
What happens to cost per kb?
It takes time to adjust but in the end it settles around 1/4th of its original value.
At the end of the day it will still cost $1M to attack the network even at most optimistic assumption. You need to note that attacker will create more harmful transaction than a regular user. If the attacker is a miner he won't even need to pay.
And attacker's purpose would not be to increase cost (that attack is not sustainable) but it is to make a node dysfunctional so that the economy is crippled.


Like I said you assume that the fee will remain the same as the blocksize increase, which is untrue because at that time the supply will exceed the demand and the price will drop.
@_date: 2016-10-16 09:02:53


At current block size the damage is limited


SegWit increase the capacity without worrying about consequences of the vulnerability. Classic provide a fix by crippling the transaction. Unlimited doesn't even provide a fix.

@_date: 2015-09-01 23:31:41


No disagreement over there. 


This is where I disagree. Like I said above we should aim for 70-80% utilization to keep network being reliable (not dropping txs needlessly). 


In the near term we should not aim for thousands of tps. For example PayPal level of transaction is definitely achievable within ~5-10 years. I would say that is quite an achievement for decentralized network to compete to a centralized solution.


Personally I am satisfied if let's say Bitcoin manage to achieve PayPal level of transaction. Just keep the blocksize nowhere near full. Even PayPal/Visa has different treatment on peak/normal capacity.

Similarly miner can refuse to converge just by insisting on orphaning each other's block.


No, that's not what I'm claiming. What I'm claiming is orphan rate will go up because miner refuse to update their setting to follow whatever the network majority prefers (which can be easily gamed with Sybil anyway). That's not an if, that's a certainty. This will result in higher number of 1 conf getting reversed. People can game 0-conf already. By timing the tx or cleverly splitting the network people can game 1 conf now.
Edit: Here's another scenario. Someone tricks miner by running Sybil on the network to raise block size. Miner follow (they're stupid anyway, they're the blue collar worker of the network). Then someone crafted an attack block that only miner can process (they have better hardware after all). In the meanwhile all the customers (full node) are brought down. Now there's no demand on the market. This is what happen in Ethereum BTW
Now what do you think happen when miner is trying to bring the block size back down? Yes, they will orphan each other's block in the process (because they can't upgrade at the same time) because the consensus doesn't state how to coordinate the process.
I mean seriously if you are going to decide whether to orphan other miner's block there are probably other parameters more appropriate than block size, especially after xthin. Block size only consider bandwidth and doesn't consider processing and I/O cost after all. I mean seriously?
Edit: Here's another attack. I'm an evil miner. Most of the capacity is running at 1MB. With some running at 2MB and 4 MB. What happen when I created 2MB block? There will be a fork. And if the person I'm double spending happen to accept 2MB, what will happen. Now I can game 1-conf (perhaps 2 conf with luck). I mean this method is just full of hole.
This is just something I can think of in half an hour. It is probably a swiss cheese.

Unlimited flags for BIP109 while they actually haven't implemented the sigop limit. Roger Ver tests his mining pool in testnet using Unlimited. Since they get 75% hash rate in testnet BIP109 is triggered. Someone makes a tx that breach the sigop limit in testnet and since Unlimited doesn't implement the limit they actually mine it. Classic node refuse the block so they are getting forked. Now since Unlimited is gaining traction Classic removes the limit as well to prevent being forked. And that folks, is why in general you never mix politics in technical discussion.

Actually the real danger is the network instability. Since miners are free to orphan each other's work some 1-conf or even 2-conf would be reversed. This means lost revenue for the miner. We have seen 0-conf being gamed. With this scenario it is possible to game 1-conf and 2-conf. 
Unlimited claims that miner will quickly converge to reach consensus but as can be seen with ETH/ETC fork this is not truly the case. Even if it is there will be lost revenue and instability.

Actually fast internet speed doesn't even come into play. You need to remember where does miner transfer their block? Directly to another miner? No. You transfer it to a "peer", another full node, which then transfer it to another full node, etc. until it reaches another miner. So the bottleneck would be the full nodes, not the miner. Miner only affects the first hop.
And like what you said it is beneficial for big miner to keep their blocks a secret from their competitor (selfish mining)


Actually large liquidity also paints bigger bullseye on your back. So there is an actual incentive to keep things small.


If everything goes well running a channel will be like running a Bitcoin node. It will be very difficult to regulate. I mean what are you going to do? Ban the software?
Potential KYC, like always, only happen on fiat bridge.


The analogy is checking account and savings account. You put whatever you are going to spend on your checking account and whatever you are going to keep for a long time on your savings account.


I'm just offering counterargument up there, of course there will be potential issue in the future. But this is something we need to undertake to preserve 21m coins limit.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:52:06


It's escalating because there is demand. We only need to worry the day it starts to stagnate.


Which is why there is SegWit. But the fact is this is something that we need to live with one day and we already can see which wallets caught with their pants down. Without this do you think wallets will bother to implement smart fee rather than say altcoin support?


No but without the innovation in place we can't increase capacity. That's like putting the cart before the horse.


Well, there is that and uncontrolled capacity increase without proper precaution will result in what happen to Ethereum. Block size limit actually serves as DoS prevention for a lot of things at once. And many of them are not linear. Say quadratic hashing, by increasing block size by 2 you will increase processing by 4 times. Or UTXO, which is a long term resource (not a one-time expense, unlike processing or bandwidth). Not to mention things we don't yet know where there is transaction where fee is cheap (only takes a small amount of bytes) but the damage is very big. Sure we can take out block size limit but we need to study what kind of adverse effect it will have and whether we need to put on another limit to replace it.
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:43:26
Apparently the big blocker thinks that capacity increase is not so urgent now.. *shrugs*
(Ironically I **do** think it's urgent but I am somewhat of an exception being a small blocker who thinks that way)
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:53:35


That's what happen in Ethereum's DoS


Happen during ETH/ETC fork


Tell that to average Joe


That's not what happen in Ethereum. In fact the reason DoS attack is successful is because this is objectively false


Point me to a time where 2-block re-orgs happen.


By assuming that "something bad is unlikely to happen" you have just made a definition of Black Swan event.
The more fragmented people's settings are the more fragile the network would be. The whole consensus system depends on everyone's setting to be the same. By targeting the difference between everyone's minrelaytxfee one can game 0 conf what you are proposing now is extending this vulnerability into 1-conf and 2-conf


That's because you haven't understood the extent of damage my scenario will cause


First of all RBF doesn't make 0-conf any more unsafe. OTOH Unlimited method objectively makes 2-conf more unsafe as you have confirmed. RBF enables cost-saving by combining multiple tx to be combined before the first one confirmed. Unlimited has no advantage aside from being more "politically palatable". 
Unlimited means you no longer have security on 0-conf,1-conf, and 2-conf (and probably more).
How is weakening security of the network counts as "safely"?
I mean seriously, Classic's 2MB is still considered ok, Ethereum's miner's vote is still relatively OK, but Unlimited? It's like they don't even understand Bitcoin's security model.
@_date: 2016-10-13 07:32:02
The question is what happen when they do? Not how likely it is to happen. Try again.
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:52:03


Actually that "side effect" is the outcome of scaling safely. 2MB block allows attacker to amplify their attack by more than 2. So by quadrupling the block size you can only effectively get 1.7x
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:37:42
Errr... Actually no. Exchanges are not inside for starter. Not to mention that Bitcoin is so old that you have no idea who is still hodling Bitcoin. Loaded himself probably has as many Bitcoins as Bitmain. Satoshi himself could come in and sell all his Bitcoin. We haven't even talked about Mircea Popescu or Bearwhale. This is the reason why Core won't release HF without proper precaution (e.g replay/wipeout)
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:46:52


You are not listening. There will no longer be 1mb limit. Like I said that limit will be removed entirely and replaced by something else.


Dynamic block size will ensure the miner will determine whether you can use the blockchain in the future.


That's because they are still assessing the risk.

Unlike certain other people, someone actually has integrity for a change. Personally I do support BIP148 just to show rbtc how Core doesn't control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:15:32


Because I care about decentralization? TBH if Classic actually forks I don't mind. I would probably buy some but they don't so here we are. (it is still a better solution than Unlimited, I don't know how anyone sane could actually use that over Classic)
What do you people like to say? "Competition is good"? I still think Core still leads over Classic by a slight margin everything considered. That's why I never said anything overly pro-Core when Classic is still leading.
Secondly if the fee stagnate it is not too late. We still can respond if we have solutions ready. Right now it doesn't stagnate. The decentralization indicator OTOH is flashing red. 
I had no idea that [miner is not being disadvantaged by publishing large block](
I ran a full node. When the blocksize debate started it was still ~30-40GB? Now it is already nearly 100GB. Sure I can run pruned node but who will help people bootstrap a new node?


The witness data is the least harmful of all parts of the transaction. It doesn't contribute to UTXO and processing is still limited input. So the only thing it hits on is bandwidth, which is remedied by compact block. The other two (storage and processing) is not affected by compact block.


I am just making argument on the word **artificial**. As it turns out, it is not artificial. Just like global warming. We need to change the way we use the blockchain or there will be no more blockchain.


Which Unlimited doesn't bother to implement


Large scale CoinJoin for example. Sure it is an edge case but it is good to not limit tx size if we want to compete with the likes of Ethereum.


But the effect is cumulative and there is adversarial scenario to consider(it is surprising that something so small in byte size can be the sole contributor to storage). If someone actually do an attack on that we will suffer the same fate as Ethereum.


Both sides are to blame (that 75% vs 95% though, what are they kindergartner?).


No, but I would like to study the system more so that we can replace block size limit with something more sane


@_date: 2017-05-29 15:24:52


How do you propose people do that? By repeatedly re-spending the tx until one sticks? Seems a little bit inefficient.


Is there any open source tool to do that? Maybe implement Peter Todd's locktime method?
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:35:01


OK, I'd like to hear how would you "address all such concern without putting Bitcoin at any risk" 


Segwit works just started last year. In fact the earliest I have heard of block size is the following Jeff Garzik's thread. 
Which is just having its 6th birthday, not 7. Even then there was minimal follow up. Block size debate just started its escalation path when Gavin raised it some time last year (honestly he or someone else should have raised it sooner and don't back down when opposition encountered though) so it's actually 1 year old.

@_date: 2017-05-01 14:18:31


In those scenarios it is better for the system to shutdown until we figure out precisely what happens rather than letting whatever implementation continue to run. Consider 0.7-0.8 split you mentioned. Technically 0.8 ran as expected so we should follow 0.8 right? But in the real world since 0.7 was used by economic majority we switch to 0.7. 
Now consider the same scenario with Core-Parity split. Parity has the correct implementation but economic majority was running Core. I think it is wiser for Parity to shut down until we figure out the cause and achieve consensus on which chain to follow because 
1. It is still possible that Parity chain will be discontinued anyway because too many people have received payment in Core chain that doesn't exist in Parity chain (require bug-for-bug compatibility with Core)
2. Consensus break down can happen still affect Parity. Take a look at Ethereum's last split:
In that case actually **both** implementations got it wrong.
Also worth to mention that with more implementations there are more possible ways for chain split to happen C(n,2).

It will be in the future when fee makes up most of the miner reward. If there is a period of time where mempool is empty miner has incentive to take rewards of previous block instead. That is fact of life. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it less true.

The surge is only temporary now and there is a period where backlog can be cleared but the situation is already less than ideal. A prediction of 1 block away from confirmation can be easily 3-4 blocks away in real situation where there is a surge.

Can they speak English? I find it very sad that miners don't actually follow development when Bitcoin actually revolves around international community.

I disagree a 1TB portable HDD costs USD100 8 years ago and it still costs the same today. (And the website specifically mentions that they only focus on hard drive)


1. You don't understand. Miner will rely on non-miner to relay information so this time no matter what miners spend to download a block/verify a transaction they will need to wait for non-miner to finish. Non miner will act as a bottleneck
2. What do you think will happen when you increase the block size


Once again you don't understand miner **depend** on non-miner to relay information so if non-miner doesn't have enough power the power to make block is going to be concentrated on single miner


Which Unlimited doesn't even bother to implement

At 2mb you might not have 100 satoshi/byte because there is no demand.
Actually we have an empirical observation. In March 2013 we reach soft limit, block produced by miner cannot exceed this because of a setting in Bitcoin Core. So Mike Hearn asks everyone to increase this limit:
So the fee drop to roughly 1/5th its original value
(scroll all the way to the bottom, took until 2014 though because fee adjustment is still manual)
So by increasing the limit you are actually providing more attack surface with roughly the same cost. So if we take into account the 2013 case and the current case (both cases having backlog). The transaction fee is still roughly the same.
But let's say it is. Actually the cost is the same (as long as we are talking per/kb limit). All it takes is 101 sat/byte to push 1 byte worth of transaction out of bound (or whatever the lowest transaction is) for both scenarios.


Personally I don't think this is an attack as long as the cost vs resource consumption is the same for both the attacker and the normal guy. What constitutes an attack is when there is a transaction that is ridiculously cheap (not proportional to its cost) and the attacker can use this to abuse the system.

Errr.. No thanks. The next thing you know miner start censoring transaction based on closed door meeting. Any proposal that comes out of closed door meeting should receive heavier scrutiny.


Again he was operating under the assumption that they are working for the same team. Evidently they are not.


And my economic incentive may not be the same as miner. (as a matter of fact it maybe the opposite). If the two run in the opposite direction then I might need to fire the miner.

No, it is not shoehorned. The solution was just happen to be that good that it fixes a lot of problem at once. 
The reason Gavin and Mike is frustrated is that Core doesn't accept any solution less than perfect. So we can see now the standard of Core's acceptance.

By variance or price discovery it is possible that a chain which was previously minority will become majority and vice versa. Someone who was following one chain can suddenly follow another. They can be tricked into accepting non-zero conf by anyone who replay-protect themselves. 


It is the responsibility of the **forking chain** to provide replay protection, and not the status quo chain. It was **Ethereum** who provides replay protection and not Ethereum Classic.

At 100GB currently many people can no longer run a full node. And HDD is no longer getting cheaper
Secondly to be totally efficient the UTXO must be stored in memory. Right now it is already around 1.4 GB. Pretty soon we might start to need to swap. And if you don't realize the reason Ethereum can gets attacked recently is because their state is too big that they need to swap.
Thirdly I think what many people don't think about is that it is not only sufficient that your node manages to accept the transaction but also contribute to the network (e.g. miner's effort). Remember miner need to spend most of their time hashing, and not downloading and verifying a block. If one of the node is a bottleneck no matter how good a miner's HW they will still be getting bogged down.
We haven't even addressed adversarial scenario like quadratic hashing.

Let me remind you that Ethereum Classic starts at 0 with no devs, no miners, literally 0 day to prepare and yet it still survives.

When that actually happen there will be less pro-BIP149 supporter (who has to live with BarryChain until they split). Personally I feel safer with BIP148 chain than any chain that still co-exist with Jihan.
And personally you (and to certain extent I) hold some degree of responsibility in that. You went "everything is fine, give miner sometime to upgrade just until the last minute". Even now you still insist that Bitcoin is awesome not realizing that some of the pro-Segwit crowd is actually someone who has been priced out of Bitcoin ecosystem who happily supports BIP148.

Sure, let's forget about Greg Maxwell's effort reaching out to small blocker to agree to Segwit. Or Eric Lombrozo's effort reaching out to Bitmain. The only reason Segwit fails is because Bitmain doesn't come clean about ASICBOOST. 


would have been made to avoid incompatibility-- simply to separate
concerns. 
Well, **that** and the fact that Big Blocker is inconsistent do you want a band-aid fix or you want a permanent solution?. You can't have both at the same time. Segwit is a band-aid solution that is designed to minimize technical debt. If you want a permanent solution and are willing to wait then say so.

1. Not in consensus layer
2. Supported by Jeff Garzik
3. Part of Satoshi's original design


1. Not in consensus layer
2. And what would be the objection to that?


ChainCode Labs/MIT actually employs more.


By your very liberal definition it is impossible to achieve that condition since either
1. Rules is so arbitrary that it is impossible to detect
2. Rules conflict a lot that orphan rate went up
A better measure would be how many hashrate controlled by a single entity? Let me remind you that 
1) Bitmain controls ViaBTC
2) Bitmain controls BTC.TOP

Quadratic hash protection, UTXO bloat worst case, more time needed to write test, ensure no consensus break between implementation, discount the signature for legacy tx instead of foolishly doubling the weight etc.

Ethereum Classic starts with nothing. No developers. No ecosystem. No miner. No wipeout advantage. Yet it is the 5th largest altcoin right now. All it takes is a demand for the coin and miner will follow.
BIP148 at minimum already has Luke-jr and Eric Lombrozo. Mycelium and Electrum seems to be onboard. Not to mention wipeout advantage. If anything I would be worried about the main chain. It requires consistent hashpower bigger than BIP148 chain to avoid being wiped out. Add to that the mess that is NY consensus. Personally I wouldn't want to run the Core client now.

Eric Lombrozo has freedom of speech as well. And you can see people condemning milos or breitbart as well. Because it is the right thing to do.


The benefit of BIP148 is that it takes the decision making out of miner's hand and put it into the market's hand.


Why does gov print money anyway? Because benefit &gt; loss. If you bitcoin value drop by less than 10% but your incomes doubled it is worth it.


Bitcoin is meant to last 1000 years. Miner should not be able to print more than 21M neither now nor 1000 years in the future.


Yet that guy holds 40% hashpower.


In decentralized currency no one is telling you what to do and not to do. That includes BIP148

1) He is assuming a 100% yield on the wafer. 


As someone who works in semiconductor industry this is far from the case. In memory yield is only around ~90%, ~60% at early ramp. With logic in foundry it is even worse (probably ~60% at mature, ~30% at ramp).
2) He didn't take into account "insider discount". If you knew someone who knew someone (e.g like Chandler Guo or Jiang Zhuoer) you can get a discount on the equipment. That's how Chinese do business. Heck, some Chinese restaurant has menu that is offered only when you speak Chinese. Or give you discount when you pay in cash and speak Chinese(because IRS can't track them). How many percent of hashrate is using this discount?
3) Read his "Profit from mining section"


Yes, you read it right his profit from mining helps them during mining manufacturers downturn.
4) ASIC production is a one time fee. In the long term profitability is determined by electricity consumption. Because of increase in Bitcoin price the profit skyrocketed but this is only in short term. That calculation is only valid for now, in the future hashrate will also increase to compensate for increase in price.

How is that a technical debt? Satoshi created OP_NOPs specifically for doing this. P2SH was also deployed the same way. OTOH Nodes that haven't upgraded will be protected by nodes that have (and miner). In HF nodes that haven't upgraded will be left to fend for themselves.


On an economic standpoint commitment to SegWit means zero commitment to a fork. If that is not the beautiful definition of "vote with your money" I don't know what is


You call that adversarial case I call that feature enabler.
Big Blocker when Ethereum has smart contract:"Wow such innovation!" Big Blocker when Core says 75% discount for smart contract: "How dare they!"


You think that 2mb means 2x damage? Wrong. WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG. The reason signature gets discount is because that is the place people can do least damage. Messing around with input will get you quadratic hashing. Messing around with output will get you unbounded UTXO growth.


At the cost of the fact that they're not yet ready, deployment takes takes longer time because HF (unless you want to throw safety out the window), [doesn't help hardware wallet, and doesn't take care of quadratic hashing]( nor unbounded UTXO growth.

With a normal node that consumes roughly 600MB and took around 2 days to sync. Also note the non-linearity since platter is several orders of magnitude slower than memory.


1. Without limit empirically blocksize doubles every 1year so you can expect that limit to be reached within a year
2. At 200MB growth per year it will take 10 years to reach 2GB. I would assume users would only be willing to let a program to use only 20% of its memory (e.g browser takes around the same amount of memory)


Exactly the scenario you will have with 100MB cache. And like I said platter is still the typical storage. This is a typical memory-starved sync case
Note that he hasn't even hit the current peak load.


CPU doesn't even kick-in until it hits the assume-valid block


OK. My timeline is off by a a bit. It still doesn't explain Dec-Mar spike. Bitcoin price is still relatively stable back then. It also doesn't explain the taper off in June (which still has a 25% increase)

Because that is the correct way to do it. Messing around with the input will get you quadratic scaling. Messing around with the output will get you unbounded UTXO growth. So the only way to increase the limit safely is by increasing the limit for signature.
This is the future direction we are heading towards (correct one too IMO). Go towards block weightage (gas limit in Ethereum). Block size is a pretty shitty DoS limit anyway.

Those still on the fence regarding BIP148 take a look at this at shit you have to deal with for another year. Core devs infighting on top of Jihan-Core fights. Not even BIP149 has consensus.


That's what is implemented in BIP66. The failure to do so is the cause of chain split.


Yeah you are completely ignoring the case of BIP148 splitting the chain causing people to lose money because of (Edit:)~~your~~ inaction. 
Miner need to realize that there is a difference between readiness signaling and voting. With forced orphaning we can be sure that miner won't asleep at the wheel and cause a chain split later on. If they are not ready they need to sit in the corner until they are ready.

The answer is most likely because unlike both of them Peter Todd has ethics. He won't do things that could cause people to lose money.


Maybe the attack is only possible because of rushed implementations to meet the 6 months deadline? You know, the one that all of Core Devs have been warning about. Seriously you don't get to [unanimous disapproval]( unless your idea is ridiculously bad. Take a look at BIP148 (which is a half-bad idea) and compare it with Segwit2x. Or for that matter [BIP16]( which is actually semi-vulnerable to collision attack by a state level actor.

OK, let's talk about pCoinsTip cache strategy. pCoinsTip has three strategies, FLUSH_STATE_ALWAYS, FLUSH_STATE_IF_NEEDED, FLUSH_STATE_NONE, and FLUSH_STATE_PERIODIC:
You can take a look at the logic to determine what each state represents here:
Basically periodic=regularly flush, if needed=only if the usage is &gt; than allocation, and always=is always flush, and none is well, you don't need to flush.
ConnectTip() uses FLUSH_STATE_IF_NEEDED
In fact I've almost never seen FLUSH_STATE_ALWAYS (except during init). Mostly it is PERIODIC (during period of non-syncing)
I mean think about it, if you always use FLUSH_STATE_ALWAYS can your memory usage exceed 100MB when your block size is merely 1MB?

I find it very surprising that people still can't understand that closed door meeting doesn't work in Bitcoin. The reason Segwit gains traction is that it comes from an open source code Elements Alpha ( Someone not working for Blockstream even asks for the feature to be implemented in Bitcoin:
When Luke-jr submits his proposal it also happens in the open in IRC (can someone link a botbot link? why botbot search sucks). That's how it gain traction. Similarly UASF starts with the following email:
Compare that to spoonnet, which although was a good idea comes from closed door HK Roundtable meeting. If this kind of idea doesn't gain traction you can't expect any worse idea to be accepted (example: extension blocks coming from purseIO and Bitmain)
Even worse is the current closed door meeting, which apparently doesn't have any developer in it. It seems that they are promising the impossible with deployment of Segwit in alternating bit and a HF in 4 months.

Seeing that our sync time is within the same order of magnitude I can't see why our CPU usage is so different. Even if my bottleneck is somewhere else I shouldn't have 1/25th of your cpu usage (yes it hovers somewhere around 4%).


You can search for more people with dbcache issue. Not all of them are using flash disk. In fact that is number one problem people have.


The only way that could happen is that if the proportion of (sigma(delta(whatever_things_you_have_mentioned))/total_utxo_newly_created) is increasing over time, which entails an entirely different spending behaviour over time. I don't see how that could be true, especially when lost coins are less likely as bitcoin worth more and wallets are getting smarter to be rid of dust.

**Adequate hardware**. Exactly. What is your target hardware? As an example this fellow is unable to make transaction during Ethereum's attack. 
I consider this an attack because legitimate people will no longer be able to outbid the attacker (while the attacker just need to relay his attack transaction somehow). 


Actually this is **not** what I consider an attack. Network security is very expensive, and it is important that someone pay for it. Whether it is attacker, government, or whoever.


Perhaps at that fee Bitcoin no longer is a use case to you (At least until Lightning arrives). But it is still **is** to someone else. As an example SWIFT fee is around $30 dollar, and last time I use WU the fee is around $10. People who uses Bitcoin as long term store of value or DNM user probably wouldn't mind paying that amount either.


I think the last attack only lasts around what 2 weeks? 1 month? And yet people still trusts Bitcoin.


You're assuming $1 fee right? There's still someone willing to pay $1.1 to outbid the attacker so I'd say the attacker won't be as successful as you think.

You mean like people spending $5000 to attack Ethereum just for the lulz? In the end some people might appreciate lower block size limit. And when this happen you won't have enough preparation to guard against replay attack for example.


How do you know which block to orphan when you haven't processed them?Note: I am not talking simply about big block that a node haven't agreed on, but a block that a node have agreed on but contain a poison, like quadratic hash, or some other unknown vulnerability (my guess is some of the core devs knew but haven't disclosed them like BIP66-related vulnerability)
Until the chain is 4 blocks deep remember? Then they have no choice 


With current Bitcoin state I can confidently say 2-conf is set in stone.

"TheDAO has been audited by all the experts"-&gt; Someone took everything away in the end
"ETC will die within a few days" -&gt; Nearly a month and its value is still nonzero
"No one will bother to spend money to attack Ethereum"-&gt; DoS attack
You also need to remember this is just some scenario that I come up with within a day and I am still not 1/10th as good as whoever is DoSing Ethereum right now (and they will probably have more time to analyze the code)

Just in case you didn't realize the entire hashrate running BU is powered by Jihan 
That's roughly 40%. (Well BitClub is not by btc.com is). You don't know who else is working for Jihan in secret. There was rumor that Bixin (previously HaoBTC) was being helped by Jihan in the past when their exchange went bankrupt. If BIP148 has lower value than main chain then split chain most likely will happen.

The problem is that Jeff Garzik attempts to "increase" block size limit by changing MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE, which actually doesn't do anything because that parameter is only used in test (or maybe in belt/suspender somewhere)
It wasn't until someone pointed out to him that he knows that he needs to change the weight as well. 
Sergio did the same thing with his BIP






Duh that doesn't increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:09:40


There is a bug in the default mining configuration though. It will prevent miner from creating the required wipeout protection block. 
In addition to that it is quite likely that the wipeout protection required will fail in the real world scenario without actually spamming the blockchain. Logically people won't be making any transaction near hard fork time due to all the uncertainty. Doing so will require people to fiddle out with replay protection after all and most people will just adopt wait and see attitude regarding best known method to do so.

That is not strictly true. You will need to consider address reuse as well (or the value inside the output). Or at least study their effects.


Precisely Eric Voskuil's observation:


This is one of the reasons people are trying to keep as much of the UTXO in memory as possible.The current basic recommended sync strategy is to avoid flush as much as possible for those people we knew for certain to be I/O limited (dbcache=4096, which is the total number of UTXO 4GB). Although apparently 300-600MB is enough if you are network limited. I suspect that is the number for a single flush where most of the long term lost/hodl utxos are being flushed. This number comes from trial and error, and not from effort to keep flush rate the same or anything.


the cache limit and testing on various configurations.
Once you need more flushes it is pretty much unknown territory.
Most miners are also keeping the entire UTXO set in memory as well.
If you disagree with Eric, the burden of proof is on you.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:51:36


To see this clearer it is better for you to take a look at the other formula, which is 4\*base+witness &lt;4000000. When you have no segwit tx the witness part is 0, which means that 4\*base &lt; 4000000 which reduces to base &lt; 1000000, basically the same as previous limit. 
Additional note:(that other formula comes from witness + base = total so witness = total - base so limit must be = 4 \* base + (total - base) = 3 \* base + total.
I find it a little bit surprising that it is less obvious to many people...
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:45:28


You haven't answered what we could have done more.


There was no Jeff Garzik until he was appointed by Barry Silbert. There was no flag day until jtimon brought it up (because Bitmain was so afraid that other miner would defect after Segwit was activated for miner-assisted hard fork, which is pretty stupid because there is no way to enforce that).


Like I said Eric and Matt attempt to contribute to btc1 only to be rejected. When the proposal was offered to Core Devs it was stated that the 6 months timeline is non-negotiable. How likely do you think that kind of scenario will happen? Really unlikely.


Like I said I have been spamming the spoonnet link every time HK agreement was brought up. You should stop looking up into only the people you know. None of the Ethereum Classic supporter knew each other. Most of the Monero Dev are anonymous.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:36:44


I am talking about Bitmain in specific. The entire hashrate signaling for Bitcoin Unlimited is controlled by him


So they think Segwit is bad but they still do it anyway because we attach a block size increase? 
1. Segwit is block size increase
2. Proposal should be evaluated on its merit. If they think an upgrade is bad they should block it no matter what kind of additional feature we offer.
See? Irrationality.


Since everyone supports Segwit there is no need to distinguish between the two. Activate Segwit then talk about blocksize increase. Another evidence of miner being irrational


Let's not pretend that there is no resistance from Jihan
Here's another list of his power trip behaviors
1. Wanting to increase capacity but blocks the single most ready capacity increase proposal by at least 6 months
2. Wanting to increase capacity but blocks non-bandwidth effort (LN, Signature Aggregation, MAST, Rootstock) to increase capacity by 6 months
3. Work with Bitcoin Unlimited instead of Spoonnet even though it is a piece of shit that he himself doesn't run
4. Spam Bitcoin blockchain for 6 months
5. Delay the shipment of Litecoin miners when they attempt to activate Segwit there.

You can't blame him for supporting BIP148 now. For his personal gain as well.


No. Miner has all the incentives to push 21M limit up for the same reason government print money. If they can't get enough money from tx fee what other method they can use to "increase consumption"?


We are talking about the same guy who pushes broken solution like BU. You can throw "sane" assumption out of the window.


Who says BIP148 is not part of the maneuver?


Nope. never meant to be temporary. Satoshi says 'it can be lifted if need to' but he never says what is the criteria and not to mention he doesn't have the knowledge that we have now.

Also tell them that the only reason Jihan spreads that lie is because he wants to cover the fact that he can use the same chips he sells at lower power consumption than all other people. In other words he is using a special mode that is not available to other miner. Segwit disables this mode

I am afraid this will be misunderstood. **"Core"** is not planning anything because there's simply no such a thing as **"Core"**. There's only individual contributors to a project called "Bitcoin Core". **Johnson Lau** has one such proposal, called spoonnet but **Johnson Lau is not "Core"**. The way I see it this proposal has quite a fair bit of support from let's say Matt Corallo, Adam Back, Sergio Lerner and AJ Towns but **they are not "Core"** either. Like you and me they will need to write a proposal to be discussed in public by other collaborators. Let's imagine that they do that.
Now let's switch the perspective to other contributors. You will need to remember that each contributors has their own set of views, projects, and priorities. How do you think they would react when the proposal was brought forwards? This is how imagine it.
"You are telling me to drop whatever I'm working for to work on this? Why? Capacity increase is urgent? Not the way I see it. Segwit is not yet activated after all. Besides all the company that was saying capacity increase is urgent are working on Segwit2x instead of your proposal. They don't seem to require our help. Why should we support them? Looks like they are more interested installing a government made of cartels... So yeah, I'm not going to help you."
There you go, HF is probably postponed to I don't know when. I think if you want capacity increase most likely signature aggregation will be proposed well, maybe sometime this year? That is required for scalability and fungibility improvement so most likely people will be more interested to work on that (although, again nothing is certain, some shitty miner might block that again or some other contributors might raise another fuss)
Frustrating? Perhaps. This is why most Core devs are not so concerned with Segwit activation. They are already used to disappointment (which might seem irrational from their point of view because you can't make two people see exactly the same thing after all.).

1. **Positive** Side Effects. Which still makes it better
2. That still manages to convince Poloniex to list them anyway.


The beauty of Bitcoin is that it enables autonomy, which is the opposite of governance by representation. I am still not sure why anyone wants representation when they can have the original political system instead.


I don't really like to repeat myself but
1. At least it happens in the open. The terms are pretty clear.
2. It **attempts** to buy in, that's why it's not inside Bitcoin Core yet. If people are not convinced they can make a competing soft fork or whatever.

*Sigh* If you are going to debate me on ASICBOOST makes sure you properly understood the topic. 
There are two types of ASICBOOST, overt and covert. Overt is the most efficient but detectable. Covert one (covered by B part) is what we are talking about here. There are two versions of Covert, the less efficient version (what we call B1/regular ASICBOOST) and the more efficient version (what we call B2 that is in the end going to be disabled by Segwit). 
Sure you can still use B1 after Segwit but that will require you to redo all the tooling (especially if you have FPGA/ASIC in the pipeline). You haven't even considered the fact that in the long run profit margin will tend to go to zero(remember that not so long ago Bitcoin price is still around 600$, and 200$ before that). In the short term this may not make sense but as Bitcoin price rise so will the hash rate. A 5% additional margin can make or break a miner when your profit margin is less than 0% without ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:22:08


Errr... No it is not. I've tried running simulation vs syncing electrum server while simultaneously syncing at the same time. Syncing while the electrum server is reindexing is much slower. I'm barely using one core when I'm trying to sync while it is idling. Are you sure you are not mistaking some malware as a full node?
OK, let's say it's cpu bound. Let's say multiplying up a merkle tree requires 2n where n is the number of transaction(does it even do that? Let's say it does this is the most expensive operation I can think of). Typical full block has 3 transaction per second. That means there are:
6\*60(seconds)\*60(minutes)\*24(hours)\*365(days)\*10(years-of-bitcoin)=1892160000 hashes
At 100khash/s that will take you ~5 hours to verify everything and yet it took you 8 hours. You see nothing wrong there? Note that I am using the assumption that block is full since day 1 (which it is not) and 100khash is a typical low end cpu. A higher end model would be 10x-100x faster. 


Who cares? As it turns out it was memory issue after all.


Are you saying the "hot set" has somehow a sub-linear correlation with UTXO size?
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:16:14

During the Asian Financial Crisis of '97, Islamic Bank arguably does better than its peer.

You believe in Bitcoin, where are the $100 Billion Bitcoin company? Islamic Banking is relatively new (started in 1950s) so until we learn through multiple financial crisis we won't understand how much better it is. For now let's just say the higher growth rate doesn't come from nowhere.

Satoshi broke it when he added 1MB limit (or for that matter 32MB limit). And he broke it again when he rejected Jeff Garzik's patch. And he broke it again by not coming up and removes the limit.

OK. Let's do this from the start. Let's say the size of cache is m. Let's say that there are n UTXO in set. The probability of a cache hit is m/n if we just use random cache. You are asserting that we can reduce n to dn/dt if there is enough temporal locality in the usage. The question is if there's enough temporal locality in Bitcoin UTXO usage to justify that reduction. Can you show this?
For all we know of we might have to increase dt by a factor of 2 just to keep the hit rate the same if we increase UTXO size by 2 times.

1. I'm still not sure what kind of risk it possess to the wallets seeing that AFAIK none of the wallet even interacts with nVersion
2. He is assuming that somehow the legacy chain will have lower hashrate even though miner will subject to the market force as well
The only explanation I can find for the real reason behind this is to make it more difficult for light client to choose the chain, which is consistent with Bitmain's power hungry behavior.

There are hundreds of such scenario. When Lightning Network doesn't grow in the forked chain because people are too dependent on on-chain capacity.

When there is not enough fee pressure to keep the 21M BTC limit in the forked chain. When people manage to exploit RCE in the forked chain. When the cartels, being a central point of failure, is pressured by government to start confiscating their Bitcoin. When Core manages to introduce various anonymity feature in the main chain.

False. You are completely ignoring the concept of economic power. It was the economic power who triggers the survival of ETC, not the the hashpower. And running a fullnode gives you potential to be one of the economic power when all the exchanges are corrupt.
You can't be an economic power if you don't run full node.


Because there is no consensus. We could easily fix mining centralization by changing PoW but there is no consensus change on that either.

Any less than 300MB and you will sync in weeks instead days. 


It is less than 10 years for 1MB and much worse (&lt;3 years) for 2MB. That is assuming no one does UTXO bloat.


Sync is I/O limited for a typical PC.

I don't understand. So you need to produce a valid PoW to commit?

Syncing without verifying is at least 10x less CPU time than verifying. A typical CPU can verify SHA256 in the order of 100k-1M hash/s vs ~10K/s for ECDSA signature verification


USB 2.0? Perhaps. USB 3.0 OTOH is as fast as SATA.


*facepalm* Read the solutions. Increasing the dbcache works 


What? Of course there is. Mem usage scales linearly with UTXO. It is even worse than linear, it is block size * time, not just blocksize. 


No. Dec-Mar period has nearly the same magnitude in increasing fashion.


1. Mempool should be a lagging indicator
2. You don't see the same correlation in May 16 where price increase nearly the same amount.
@_date: 2017-07-04 10:41:46


Unless the problem with data growth is taken care of by gated sync or any other means it is unwise to increase the block size. Creating UTXO is too cheap as it is.


You must be blind.


Every single soft fork does that. Failure with BIP66 deployment is caused precisely by that issue.


If the newer client is backdoored there will be a fork with older client when someone tries something nasty.


NO YOU FUCKING IDIOT. There's only single parameter. It's called weight, which is 4*base+witness. In fact changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter in the code does nothing. Fee per byte is now replaced by fee per weight, which in the case of legacy tx reduces to fee/per byte because witness is always 0.

Well, the truth is that layer doesn't currently exists. Meanwhile the block size is continuously increasing:
Let's face it, right now sidechains doesn't exist. Not to mention it is difficult to tell whether sidechain is any safer than block size increase. The question is what happen when block size hits the limit while the proposed solution is not yet ready? Increase the tx fee you say? Well now you just damage Bitcoin acceptance among the crowd. Not to mention there will be some backlog of tx that needs to be cleared.
I'd propose a deadline for block size increase. If no one manages to come up with solution once a certain metric (average block size for a certain period of time?) hits the limit we need to increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-07-03 01:22:46


You must be dreaming if you can keep the patch minimal over the years.
1. When Core adds new features like MAST or Signature Aggregation you will have to convince Jihan, Craig Wright, and Roger Ver to accepts it. Fat chance that will happen.
2. Technical ineptitude is the reason that Segwit2x cannot be based on Bitcoin Unlimited. They have to rebase it on Core 0.14.1 instead
3. Add on to that the other side will have their own shitty roadmap to follow.
4. When Core finally proposes a hard fork you might find transaction incompatible with it in your blockchain. A 2x increase now will probably be incompatible with 6x increase later.
5. Segwit already gives you 2x. With 2 chains you will have 2x+4x capacity=6x. Even right now tx with fee as low 5 sat/b is being confirmed. How low exactly do you want your tx fee?
6. Signature aggregation alone gives ~30% increase. Not to mention Drivechain in the work. How much value exactly a 2x capacity adds into a chain? I'm pretty sure you can't even compensate for the technical incompetence. Take a look at btc1 discussion. Jgarzik proposes something that will self partition the network. And then he doesn't know that he needs to change the weight parameter. LOL

Yes, I can really see the benefit from your point of view. Now let's take a look from the point of view of your creditor (most likely bank). It costs them next to nothing to lend you money. They just 'print' the money in your account. That's Fractional Reserve Banking for you. In the meanwhile they can receive payment from you plus compounded interest. It is nearly risk-free for them. This encourages reckless behavior. In the case of default, hey it will be mostly depositor who will take the fall. If there are too much depositor the government will help to take the fall (bailout).
So how do we go about doing this? You need Widget Maker (and have a good business plan), and there are people with money doing nothing on their part. How about this:
1. Those creditor (which could be a bank) exchange money for share ownership in your company. Profit and asset will be divided share and share alike. You can buy back some of the shares if you want.
2. The creditor buys Widget Maker and rent them to you. Again you can buy back the Widget Maker from them.
In both cases in case of default you will not be left with 0 assets.
I believe these solutions is much healthier as the creditor's profit will be tied somewhat to their decision. I think this is some of the basis of Islamic Banking.

I am more worried on the storage side. It is a little bit too optimistic to think that Moore's Law will continue for another 20 years. Pruning is no good for bootstrapping new node. Probably the core devs will find a way to spread the blockchain across multiple nodes.
Edit: I've read your **Bitcoins and a bar of chocolate - Or: How I stopped worrying and learned to love larger blocksize**.


I don't think this is a conservative estimate at all. Right now for semiconductor we have reached the limit for 2D Patterning (EUV is nowhere in sight) and we have reached the minimum thickness possible for oxide (only few layer atom thick). Few big semiconductor player already move to 3D but it is unknown how successful this will be. We are at a crossroad here.

I find it pretty funny that everyone over there keeps on yapping about with implementation being the spec with Bitcoin Core and yet did the exact same thing. Where is the spec and the analysis (example: how long can we expect the mempool to fill up, especially in the case of no one wanting to make tx due to uncertainty)? Who is going to be responsible for spamming the network otherwise (Heh, even the fact that someone might have the responsibility to spam really reeks of political decision making similar to create a bill instead of technical one)
Are we going to do implementation first, spec second, and analysis the last?

SPV as defined by Satoshi **can** follow the ruleset by relying on fraud-proof sent by full node. 


transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. 
Lack of success in implementing this prevents SPV client from being fully fledged economic power.


No, it doesn't. (Pseudo) SPV client can simply ignore the version bit should they choose to (although only shitty wallet developer will do that).

1. You are aware that not even Segwit does that, right? That is just Bitcoin is. Once you have that, you have a leader, and in a sense Bitcoin has failed. We don't need a Vitalik, not really.
2. Why don't you be that someone? Or for that matter any of the 80 NYA signatories.
For the record I've been spamming spoonnet link every time HK Agreement was being brought up. Where is my backup? Where is my cavalry?




Actually leadership being essential **is** the popular belief. That kind of popular belief is the reason why we don't see any decentralized governance until now. Because people keeps on looking up to find a leader. 
Look at BIP148. There is no leader. Shaolinfry is not a leader, neither is Luke-jr nor Eric Lombrozo. Or for that matter Ethereum Classic. Yet it still manages to achieve its goal.
But then again, if you seek a leader perhaps Segwit2x better suits you.


Until April Bitpay still believes that there is no capacity increase required. So did Bitmain, otherwise they would have activated Segwit. Why should any of the Core Devs challenge the assertion?


Matt Corallo tried to provide a bridge so that a hard fork is more palatable
So did Eric Lombrozo
yet they are being rejected outright.
Again, you should be asking yourself this question: Is this debate still about capacity? Or is it about "Fire the Core devs"?

Like I said. It was I/O bound. Honestly I can't figure out how you could get a CPU-bound case when you are not even doing signature verification. (unless you are stupid enough to run something like Bitcoin Unlimited)
Even the LevelDB theory doesn't make sense. A database engine so successful (or so crappy) it becomes CPU bound instead?


That is a pretty naïve caching strategy... You are assuming that everything not newly created will be immediately discarded.


Actually that is a sure fire of decreasing cache hitrate over time. What are the chances of UTXO will remain hot from block 1 to block n?

Increasing the size of utxo set is reason enough to block that BIP. Even from political perspective it doesn't make sense. These are the reason against Segwit (so far)
1. Not enough blocksize increase
2. Let's Fire Core
3. It's a soft fork
4. Witness discount
For (1), (2), and (3) you won't get anything different by BIP140. For (4) you can easily take out the discount (although people will still come back to (1))
The only valid reason people could change mind is if it is because of ASICBOOST, but that would mean Jihan is lying all the time and it is not enough reason to justify change in strategy. Bitcoin is so un-scalable that anything suboptimal that you do will prevent further scaling down the road. Not to mention future upgrade (IBLT, TXO commitment) will meet the same roadblock.


It doesn't matter. We shouldn't take out 21M BTC limit just because there is not enough on-chain transaction transaction.

There is one big difference in this scenario though. Ethereum has wipeout protection in the forked chain. 
OTOH if at any point in time hashrate in legacy chain continues to fall below BIP148 chain there will no longer be legacy chain. There might be people who tries to quickly sells their legacy coin before it is getting wiped out.
Not to mention that market tends to hate uncertainty. Legacy chain still has to contend with Jihan vs Core's shenanigans for at least another year while BIP148 chain has Segwit activated (which means, amongst other thing Lightning and doubling in on-chain capacity), which means that there is an upward pressure for BIP148 chain.
Of course nothing is known for certain. It is entirely possible that the market is getting irrational that legacy chain survives. Personally I can't wait until Aug 1st.

ECDSA has 128 bit of security so I would say 128 bit. AFAIK the only thing that has 80 bits of security is P2SH (via birthday) where multisig is affected. Basically the attacker tricks the victim by pretending to give redeemScript that has victim's public key in it while actually having a separate redeemScript by collision that doesn't require victim's public key.
Note that P2WSH is not affected since it requires 256 bits hash so collision still requires 128 bits.

No, it isn't.


Segwit2x has a total of 8MB because the one implements it only know how to multiply by 2. (He did try though, but he stupidly fails to do so)


How exactly "Core" do this? Do they put a gun in your head and ask you to run their software? It's not Core's fault that Classic and Unlimited crash and burn.

The reason BIP148 doesn't have any visible support is that because most actors still praying BIP91 will comply with BIP148. Once any of the miner pull back you can expect people to switch to BIP148.

It's been a while since I last used libbitcoin so I'd welcome any correction from those more knowledgeable than me.
My understanding is Bitcoin always uses little endian when doing serialization. 
I would assume that you are using decode_hash for things it was not meant to(I think it was meant to decode/encode hash from a block/tx). Normally people would use random function as an input to secret parameter. If you are using them as a learning tool maybe you can create your own converter?
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:05:55
Nope, you're mistaken. That feature is Frontier-only and it is documented, like here:
The purpose is to prevent miner from mining on the wrong fork when consensus is still unstable. It is already removed in Homestead. Besides, miner can easily remove those from the code and still mine even after canary is triggered.

UTXO bloat for one. Eric Lombrozo and Matt Corallo offered some of the solutions to avoid this and get rejected straight.


It has been done in BIP16 deployment. Tycho, who owns ~51% of the hashpower disagrees yet it gets deployed anyway.


[Do you understand how to read chart?](


Do you appreciate that there has never been any case of hard fork in Bitcoin outside the attempt to mitigate a crisis? Do you appreciate the fact that people running a very old client to sync will help to ensure there is no backdoor in the newer client?


[took a painstaking effort to explain it to you how this is not true but apparently you are going to repeat it anyway]( Either you are too dumb or too malicious.


Do you understand that the increase to 2mb enables more dangerous spam than what Segwit enables?

And yet Bitmain has no issue at all spamming the blockchain. Again tell me how this is not power trip.


Signature Aggregation doesn't require hard fork. Neither does MAST. Or for that matter Drivechain. And guess who delays that for another 6 months?


Which crypto? Ethereum breaks down when it comes anywhere near Bitcoin's capacity. If there's anything I am afraid of it is Litecoin (and guess whose fault is that they gain an edge?

@_date: 2016-05-21 16:51:26
I've seen people posting the same thing about Electrum.
The thing about fee estimation is it is difficult to predict a surge and whether it will be permanent. Let me give an illustration for a worst case scenario. You want tx to be confirmed within 1 block. Mempool shows the maximum fee density is 50 satoshi/kb. So you send tx with 51 satoshi/bytes. Everyone else sees this and start spending 52 satoshi/bytes and you get 1MB worth of tx all with 52 satoshi/bytes. So you get bumped, it's ok you might get confirmed next block right? Not really, because you might get another 1MB worth of tx between now and the next block with 52 satoshi/bytes. So when will it get confirmed? No one knows exactly how long. At worst case fee is permanently at 52 satoshi/bytes and your tx will never get confirmed.
Sure you can RBF your way out of the situation but you will need to stay online to make the transaction (and not fire and forget). Of course you can also nlocktime a transaction with higher fee at later block and give it to third party to deliver but at this stage it is simply just overengineering (not to mention you need a third party)

If you want compare then compare peak to peak (or at least average). Peak Bitcoin is up above 300k. You didn't even bother to mention that you are comparing within the same day on your original statement:




Again, you are barely within Bitcoin's ballpark capacity. And right now you are experiencing **another** backlog. And what you consider a "remarkable day" is actually a "normal day" in Bitcoin.


You **do** understand that unlike transaction per second recorded in blockchain a "backlog" is relative right? That would depend on how much you set the relay fee to be. I can set relay fee higher than 1000 sat/byte and I can have a 0 backlog. Similarly I can set my relay fee to 0 sat/byte and get myself DoSed to death.


Because of inflation. Even then you are seeing increased uncle count by roughly 25% from the time you start to hit 75%-80% capacity.

Also 3 working days to reach your destination and can only start at working hour though. Not to mention any larger amount will bring more scrutiny toward you (e.g  &gt;$500K) and in the end you wind up with a depreciating asset instead of appreciating one.

By your definition miner wants 1MB block. Because that is what is happening now. If you want more capacity Segwit is there. Even if you want more capacity you should activate Segwit first then fight another day.
There is just simply **zero** reason to delay Segwit (well, except for ASICBOOST). Let's say it's because they can't trust the devs. So how is delaying Segwit going to change dev's mind? They have even indicated that they are not in a rush to get Segwit activated.

It **is** relevant as it serves an economic purpose.


I don't have an analysis ready because I am not the one proposing hard fork


*Sigh*  That is what is being proposed as part of hard fork, same discount applied to legacy transaction, keep the segwit part the same. 
I am not even sure you even that understand the reason behind segwit discount is to keep blocksize below 4MB, so Segwit2x already violates that.


We're talking about science here. There is a real difference between O(n) and O(lg n). Spoonnet actually implements more proper accounting for hashing, permanent storage (utxo) as part of its cost strategy instead of "hurr durr let's multiply this by 2".


And segwit2x is ready? As if. Spoonnet is never going to be ready when you keep on chasing stupid solutions like Unlimited, Classic, Segwit2x, or ABC. Spoonnet's draft is up in February. As for Segwit2x, well let's just say the last I check Sergio's proposal still attempt to "increase" base block size foolishly.

Then they should tell loudly and clearly what their objections are. I want more capacity is not a valid objection as there is nothing to be gained by blocking Segwit.


Oh, hey. Another one that doesn't affect ASICBOOST(on top of increasing the size of utxoset) which you have been pushing all along. Maybe you should try to sell that to Jihan. I heard he pays good money

@_date: 2017-07-26 19:57:05
The status quo is the one who owns the original blockchain. People can fork anytime they want provided that they do what is necessary to co-exist with the original chain. 
Most of Jihan's pet project (BU, Segwit2x) has refused to implement replay protection and changing block version number because they want to reuse original chain's resource. The only reason Bitcoin Trash finally implement replay protection is because all exchanges refuse to list them otherwise.

The mining code should synthetically be forced to produce 1MB block, otherwise they will be mining invalid block. Are you saying that miner unexpectedly spending hashpower to lose money is okay?


No, the problem is not that miners can fake it, the problem is that they have a habit to screw around with it that there is a little bit uncertainty that the transition will not be as smooth. But it  definitely beats creating 1MB block.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:37:41
Doesn't invalidate my comment though. 


Simpler and cleaner also means more secure.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:57:11


If there's enough hashpower there won't be PoW change. I don't see the problem there.


I think the message would be clear enough. You piss people off, people will piss you off. Better to tread lightly.


Why would he? That would be stupid. He has his own battle to fight in the original chain. Splitting his force would be totally stupid. He controls Litecoin ASIC and yet he can't win the battle there. GPU battle would be even tougher to fight. OTOH if you keep SHA256d Jihan can easily screw with your chain if there is not enough hashpower.


Again PoW change only happen if none of the other miner (e.g Bitfury, P2Pool, BTCC) refuse to support BIP148. Rogue miner would need to control 90% of the hashpower to trigger something like this. If BIP148 chain has 10-15% of the original hashpower that would be more than sufficient due to the snowball effect.


Luke-jr already prepared a Keccak one. Sure it will probably lead to another ASIC but hey so long as I'm getting rid of Jihan.


Anything less than 10% hashpower and you will be at risk of Jihan's attack.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:35:08


And how much time do you think we have? To sync at reasonable amount of time it took 100MB of memory last year. Now it requires 300MB. This is at **constant** block size of 1MB. That number is expected to grow even at 1MB. 
We also need to take into account adversarial case. July 2015 attack manages to eat into 2 years worth of normal growth's allotment. We haven't even talked about memory price increase this year. That's about the third time the price increase in the last 10 years or so. We are already at thin ice as it is.


Yes, and we don't have them yet. It's like we don't have solar, wind, or nuclear but let's not pay carbon tax anyway.


Only to avoid embarrassment of being forced to activate Segwit not on their own term. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the miners (e.g BitmainClub/BitFury/F2POOL) threaten to walk away if their request is not being fulfilled.


I guess they could list additional capacity from two chains resulted from the fork as pros now. I mean seriously without Bitmain jamming the network with spam the capacity is at all time low right now. What do you need all the capacity for? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:45:50


Perhaps that's because your use case is better suited with other payment solution.


SWIFT is 30$, can only happen during working hours and 3 working days for transfer. WU is somewhere around ~10% for $1000 transfer plus currency spread. Stop being overdramatic.

Would have been stupid for that seeing that none of the original proposal has any replay protection.


1. Miners are not users, they are servants, just like the devs are. Users are people who either use Bitcoin as store of value or payment rail.
2. Unlike miners, devs are not being paid to contribute so rightly there is no right for anyone to demand anything.

While that argument hold some ground that is not the main crux of the original argument. OP accuse that Eric Lombrozo has conflict of interest while I'm simply pointing out that miner has the an equal conflict of interest and Luke-jr does not. Not to mention I've never heard of Eric's name even once while I was active in ETH community. I'd think that his involvement would be quite limited.

Not sure about your definition of contributing positively but asking more time for test and review is contributing positively in my book.


No replay protection no UTXO bloat protection no wipeout protection. This point has been rehashed ad infinitum
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:34:02


Let me remind you that there are times when status quo can be harmful. An example would be quantum computing. Sure you can reason but anyone would be convinced that a break in ECDSA would be enough to convince anyone to upgrade but you have one flawed assumption, that is everyone is being rational. The current situation shows otherwise. Everyone already agreed to Segwit (yes Segwit2x is segwit) and yet it its not activated. 
In the meanwhile the party that controls 40% of the hashrate benefits everyday Segwit is not being activated while having enough money to bribe everyone not to activate Segwit. Bitcoin fails when there is big enough centralization and evidently we are heading that way. Even Peter Todd has enough sense to sell while GHash.io was holding that much hashpower.
A lot of people thinks that Bitcoin compete with gold for its stability but these people can't be any more wrong. Take a look at Ethereum. It is a piece of shit that breaks every now and then and yet people continue to pump money into it. Right now Bitcoin is a high risk investment. Maybe in 100 years it can compete with gold but now is not the time for complacency. 
If Matt Corallo or Alex Morcos or Greg Maxwell wants to continue the fight down the road that's fine by me. But it won't be my fight and all I can say is good luck to them.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:35:39


Read Bittrexx statement again.




Here's the deal. In Ethereum's account based model the same "account" need to execute in order. So let's say you want send 5 ether to person A and 10 ether to person B it has to go in **specific order**. So let's say you arrange it such that tx to person A goes first. Until this transaction is mined you can't send to person B. 
The problem is that if txA doesn't pay enough fee you can't send to person B no matter how much fee you paid because it depends on txA getting mined.
This is not a problem in Bitcoin since each UTXO can be spent separately with no dependency.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:06:31
There is no code whatsoever though...
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:00:04
It's a tad bit confusing now though. Does federated sidechain needs BIP? How about Peter Todd's OpenTimestamp? In HTLC pull request brought up yesterday it was mentioned that making non-standard tx standard doesn't require BIP.

In case you haven't noticed Eric Lombrozo and Matt Corallo offered their services and was promptly rejected. To me this indicates one of the following possible scenarios
1. Stalling tactics by Bitmain
2. "Toothless tiger" effort to save face by Bitmain
3. An effort to kick Core devs out of decision making
In all three scenarios only one right thing to do. Ignore them.

It is so simple that it causes two separate incidents already:

Backlog is required to maintain 21M BTC limit


Only as complicated as necessary to avoid both quadratic hashing and UTXO bloat.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:07:08
By mining two different coins they can pick winner and loser by hedging. By mining both Litecoin and Bitcoin Antpool has a backup plan if Bitcoin fail. OTOH a Bitcoin maximalist only have BTC as a fallback plan. I can't believe I have to explain to this to you.

1. We were talking about WU
2. They won't tell you about currency spreads upfront. But if you check their spread is not so competitive
3. They **do** have minimum fee


You kept talking about **between** national currencies meaning international transfers, right? Like I said run multiple Philippines corridor (rebit.ph IIRC) and yet it remains profitable.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:57:04
That is highly dependent on country of origin and destination. Some corridors are easier than the others.

Well, at least so far all BIP has its interaction at layer 0 (e.g wallet, consensus, implementation, network message, etc.)
I mean BIP70 and BIP38 can technically be implemented in Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:45:14
Sure, but Litecoin doesn't need them so there is no incentive for them to use it. I thought you were complaining about not enough capacity?

@_date: 2017-06-21 16:19:39
Well incoming tx also comes from other user's outgoing transaction, who probably faces the same problem with the ordering.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:32:46


1. I don't mind being an altcoin if it meant taking Jihan out
2. It is your choice if you want to fight for BIP149 against Jihan. In the meanwhile the other chain wouldn't be wasting time making progress by leaps and bounds. Don't be surprised if you see some of the prominent Core Devs jumping ships though.
3. That would only happen if none of the miner support BIP148


1. So long as the chain has value people will have incentive to secure it
2. That will teach a lesson for future miner not to go against community (e.g increase 21M limit) 
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:09:03


Guess where will pro-segwit miner go when Segwit2x fails?
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:21:24


My point is that something that started as having value because of limited supply can still have value when it is no longer scarce.


They actually did actually. Back when the reward drop 50BTC drop to 25BTC some miners actually attempted that. What they could do they would do.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:24:22


Now guess what happen when Segwit2x blows up. You know? Like Jihan backing out for some bizarre reason? Yeah, that's right. Everyone on the fence will move to this side.


Destroy their entire business? How? 


PoW change is **always** on the table. It came out during BIP109 debate. It came out just before BU crash and burn. It comes out now. And it will come out again when miner attempt to do something stupid in the future.


And yet Segwit2x was made to be compatible with BIP148
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:58:27
Since Segwit part is ready might as well activate that part first. You can then spend your time to focus on 2X part. BIP91 just adds additional complexity on top of BIP141. Complexity is the enemy of security. By activating on BIP141 you can throw away BIP91 part and just simply modify Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 (or whatever suit your preference) to get the 2X part. 
There really is nothing, repeat, **nothing** that can ensure to tie the two. It is really difficult dealing with irrational people...
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:11:09
Adding to Chris Belcher's comment point  the current asicboost user already effectively holds 40% of the hashrate so things will get worse from here. I'd rather Bitmain splits immediately rather than makes thing worse from now.

Not a single serious mining nor economic activity committed to Ethereum Classic either. All it takes is for Poloniex to list it to tip the scale.

@_date: 2017-06-11 22:57:09
This is what a lot of idiots don't understand. Bitcoin's security comes from decentralization. The lower the barrier of entry to mining the better it is. A chain that is easier to attack will be the same chain that is easier to defend. If there's a PoW that can be mined using dirt that is the most ideal PoW. 
Hashpower from an ASIC is meaningless if production is being done within one company. Besides who's to say PBOC is not behind this shit? There's no such a thing as private company in China.

So why does WU give the ability to make payment from agent? It's a liability risk as the agent can run away with the money. Because there's demand that's why.


Sorry I don't make a habit of keeping the receipt after the receiver receives the money. It's a privacy leakage as the amount of money that I have can be easily linked to my identity.


Why don't they put the number online then? Because it's much higher that's why.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:42:33
This is a bigger deal than most people think though. Miner can't tell how to maximize their fee without actually **running** all the possible account, which open themselves to a DoS attack. So now they have to depend on indeterminate heuristic to figure out how to maximize revenue.
My guess is that this is because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is designed to have perpetual inflation. I think a lot of people underestimate the number of thoughts that goes into ensuring 21M BTC limit is intact.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:04:06


Soft fork vs hard fork remember? If Satoshi disagrees with SF he has to do HF. The onus of replay protection is then on him not on us.
Unlike hard fork it is really difficult to do cloak and dagger style sabotage like I mentioned.

The point of blockchain is that everyone needs to see the same transaction. That's the whole point of blockchain consensus.

I don't care what Satoshi says. Satoshi is not a leader much less God. That's what being decentralized means.
So miner wants bigger block? Let them create bigger block. Let them run Bitcoin Unlimited. Let's see what happen.


Uh, no. It is a place where everyone including non-miner has a say. Letting miner decide the rule is like saying the president should make the constitution. Not going to happen.
Here's the thing you want miner to decide things for you? Go ahead. But so far they are too wimpy to do anything so don't count on it. And you can definitely count on me not getting on-board.
