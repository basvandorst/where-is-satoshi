Honestly hodl, it crashed a lot, but still shows positive interest. It's a very resilient stock.

Really sucks when you buy $450 and this shit happens

How are you sure this isn't the low for the next 2-4 years
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:38:27
Yeeeep and if it crashes down to nothing I can always give BOA a quick ring about an unknown charge to my account.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:37:30
Right, it's only 2 days since t went through and I haven't even gotten the coins yet...
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:18:00
Well, when you weed out the weak the strong bust in and take over 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:39:35

@_date: 2017-03-18 14:57:53
Woaaah 
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:59:58
I mean I've seen it go down for 10 minutes before, but this is kind of absurd for what is happening right now.

My father has been in a cfo at a large bank for 20 years and his son is teaching him about it and getting HIM to actually buy some. Crazy how some people think it's. scam/fake
