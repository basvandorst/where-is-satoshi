I’m not making any precise predictions, but I think that every day more people get in to bitcoin than get out. We are slowly moving forward no matter what. There will most likely be mad peaks and dips, but in the end it will just continue to grow. That’s why I HODL. We are not going backwards in the long term.

Only if they were actually running 51% of them, but they are not. They manufacture and sell their equipment. Also, even if it was possible I doubt bitmain would want to do this because they make a killing out of manufacturing and selling mining equipment. To do a 51% attack a mining collective would need to be controlling 51% of the active miners at a given time. Not the same as a manufacturer responsible for building 51%+ of the miners currently running 
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:06:27
Haha I do that too
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:42:08
You'll get it all back and more. Just hodl
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:36:55
Agree. Watch the McAfee documentary for anyone who doubts th3 context 
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:52:06
I think it will easily reach 100k. The big question is when, and I don’t know. HODL
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:01:54
Wrong 
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:04:25
lol, I'm not pissed. Day trade all you want. The OP was looking for advice to hold or sell. I shared my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:04:51
I’m still HODLING!
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:32:20
No it would be back to 8900k, which is far from 8k. 9.3k is closer to 10 than 8, with rounding. If you’d said it’s closer to 8.9k than 10 I would have agreed... 
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:18:16

@_date: 2018-03-03 03:15:30
OP = original poster. This whole thread is people responding to one guys question, should he hold or sell.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:46:43
Maybe he mines all his income. Even if it is the case it's a great sign things are changing.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:36:12
Well... it’s basically still 11k then
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:01:06
Fair enough. Price seems to be looking good though ��
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:30:20
I'm not contradicting myself, I think ppl should sell if they need the money. And people will sell. What I'm saying is to the OP, if you are trying to figure out whether you should sell now, or hold for longer, I'm saying my belief is that bitcoin has got a lot further to go than where it is now. It has a good chance of becoming widely used, for every day things, and not something that is just "day traded'
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:45:52
No it's not. The financial system is as corrupt as hell.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:31:20
Hang in there. It always goes back up.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:03:41
I can’t say I agree Bon Savage. It seems a little far fetched to think they can easily find people willing to sell them thousands of coins at a time... I think ultimately it pushes the price up anyway as coins are scarcer, it increases demand (and price). There will be fewer coins for sale on exchanges and just as many buyers as before.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:24:43
It's on its way back up, asshole
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:45:04
I totally agree. Believe in it and spread the good word to everyone.
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:31:12

The future is, people getting paid in Bitcoin, people buying groceries and paying for their vacations with Bitcoin. Because it's better, because it will save trillions in banking costs over time. I don't doubt that people are making some money day trading in this phase of Bitcoin, but if you think that is all it can be you are naive. I'm hodliing and doing everything possible to help Bitcoin become the global currency of choice. We should all be doing that.
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:58:04
I agree completely. All you naysayers who claim otherwise and no guarantees, I say: be the change. Go out and promote bitcoin. Tell everyone about it. We can all make a difference. Bitcoin is a movement.

Jesus, no offense but your comment, like so many others, is  just is too short-sighted. I've been with Bitcoin for more than 5 years. I've been through mt gox, I was elated to see Bitcoin crack 1000, I was dismayed when it went down around 200. I just kept hodling though. This past year has been amazing, and is the beginning of what many of us thought was possible all along. And it is still just the beginning. But there is a bunch of you talking about getting out of Bitcoin because the price just can't sustain?!?!! It's at fucking 10k, that's incredible! And take a look at the price chart for past 5 years, what does that tell you? It tells me 100k is possible, it also shows me that it takes time. Not that much time in the scheme of things, but years. Please, people, stop trying to make a buck off what it's worth today and what it's worth tomorrow. I personally do not believe that's where the real money is. And stress will give you a heart attack. Don't cry about daily price fluctuations. Look at the big picture.
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:58:18
I agree with most, keep hodling, I would say it is extremely likely bitcoin keeps growing. But it does take time. The best returns are seen when you hold for a year or more. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:37:40
Every person fully entitled to own opinion. But look at past 5 year chart and realise every little dip there was someone saying the same thing as you. People said $1000 was impossible, people said $10000 was insanity. It's only the beginning, more people adopting Bitcoin every day, as it has been for years. When I look at that I see Bitcoin can still grow a lot more... Just my 2c
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:05:01
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:13:11
And you are just setting everyone up so the price definitely goes down. It may not go down. A lot of people think the mt gox news is actually Bullish. I personally see it as a positive because now there is a valid explanation for why the price tanked so hard earlier this year. The mt gox guy only has so many coins to sell and then it’s done. I will hold my coins I’ve had since 2013. I don’t need the money now and there is no need for me to worry if the price dips more. It will come back.
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:40:51
We should all take note of this, and a round of applause for the author.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:23:48
No you GFY, it's going back up
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:50:36
Ok, that too
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:33:40
If bitcoin reaches wide adoption and a lot of people start being paid in bitcoin, buying groceries with bitcoin, and the bigger it gets the less the price will fluctuate, then it really will stand on its own and not just be a speculative asset. I think it’s just a matter of time. Still very early days, but imagine when 100x the current number of people are using it. I hope we get there.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:21:13
I think he just meant he anticipated a dip and had cash ready to buy more
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:50:25
You will wear the painanal face
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:20:46
I would not sell. Just hold. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:59:30
THIS ^ is how people should be looking at it. Not "OMG! It dropped $200 just now, Bitcoin is burning!"
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:36:48
I don’t think you need to worry. When buyers outmatch the whales they dump and everything gets bought, the price still goes up, and the whales are left stranded.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:43:48
You’re full of shit, chazminge, and I’ll reply to this as soon as the price proves you’re a clueless pos. It will go well beyond 12 k and soon.

Hodl on good people. I really believe we will see new highs this year.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:00:48
There was a news story a week or so back that it’s not actually low volume, since most exchanges have adopted batching of transactions it appears lower but isn’t. I don’t know enough to say if this is the reason or not, but it makes sense
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:46:12
Could not agree more. I've been HODLING for years, and I am as happy as Larry. If you look at the price hourly you are bound to start freaking out, you would also be crazy to do this... However, if you step back and look every few months I've found that I've always been very happy with Bitcoin progress:) All these noobs crying "the end is nigh!" just make me roll around on the floor laughing. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:12:48
Well... I agree dude. I'm just speaking from my own experience, ive been involved in btc for a long time. Hodling has worked well for me, and if someone asks for opinions then I'll say mine is that there is a decent chance btc is going to revolutionise the world we live in, and as it does this its value will continue to rise. I can see the appeal of day trading but I prefer not to take the risk. I spend my time on other things, like convincing my employer to give the option of paying wages in btc.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:37:20
Chazz you always spread the fud. Who is paying you to do that?
 I believe at this point Bitcoin is in very early adoption phase, yet it has enough critical mas that it would be hard to stop. I believe that, barring some huge government intervention, banning etc, (and that's unlikely when countries like Japan and Russia are acknowledging it's value) that bitcoin has a very real chance to reach wide adoption and value that is 10-100* current valuation. I think it's worth the risk and I will continue to accumulate Bitcoin. But more importantly I will continue to spread the good word and encourage everyone I know to get involved. It is financial liberty.
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:33:45
Not in every case. I invested because I am hoping that soon I can be paid 100% of my wages in bitcoin, and then buy my groceries, vacations, movie tickets with bitcoin. I invested because I’m hoping that soon I won’t need any other currency.
