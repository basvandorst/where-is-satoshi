It would basically redesign Reddit as a marketplace with really in depth forums, though.

The private key to a coin is something like "Hkd76Akjd09lid8DNskd63nk..." right? I'm still confused about what you would do with the private key written on a bit of paper to turn it into funds in your wallet, and vice versa (ie getting the private keys and writing them down on paper for safe storage). Reckon you could explain?

I'm not being aggressive. SWIM is just a silly thing if you think it's going to protect you legally (or if you think saying "i took drugs" on the internet is going to get you in legal trouble).
I think SR is very user friendly. Everybody I've shown it to has understood it straight away, even the less technologically minded. They don't really understand the ins and outs of the Tor network, but they don't need to. They just need to click the icon and type in the address. And as far as "You have to really want it to go there", all you have to do is google "How to get on the silk road" and follow the simple steps. 
As far as I can see there are 5 steps to buying on SR. Download the tor browser, navigate to the site and make an account, purchase some bitcoins, send your bitcoins to your account, make your purchase. Now there are more steps within those steps (ie making the bank transfer), but those don't really need explaining.
I guess you're right about the laws working bit though. I mean I would consider gun prohibition laws in Europe to work. If gun crime is reduced drastically by the laws, then it works. Obviously some people are still going to get guns, but it makes it *alot* harder (whereas drug laws only makes it very slightly harder) to get a gun, and makes you question whether you really need to kill this guy or if it's worth it.

Wouldn't getting payed in bitcoins be such a massive risk at this stage? Sure, you could earn a hundred bitcoins and then the value doubles over the next few weeks, but what if you get payed a hundred and it crashes and you've suddenly got no money? Sure, buy bitcoin with your wages, but you don't want 100% of your income to be bitcoin because if it crashes then you suddenly have literally nothing.

Are we really ready for business to have their revenue stream in Bitcoins? I mean at the moment it is great, because they get payed for a $100 treatment and by the next week or so it has increased to $150 worth, but it could crash. Or is it a case of big business adopting bitcoin is exactly what we need right now to strengthen it even further while it is going strong?
A problem I see is if it is rising so much, wont loads of people not want to spend their coins just yet? For example if I have 1 bitcoin, I can either spend it now and get $135 worth of goods, or I can wait until next week and maybe get $160 worth, or another week and maybe $200. This would be a problem if everybody started seeing things that way, right?

If anything I think this will be good for Bitcoin. Now it's not just something that comes with Silk Road. It's its own thing. Whenever I mention bitcoins to people (either here on reddit, or in real life), if they know what it is they just say "Oh, that's just those things you use to buy drugs on Silk Road with - it 's not real money".
