So they will crush bitcoin just like they completely stopped all file sharing? Bwahaha!

I recommend paying the IRS in bags of loose pennies.

You could check localbitcoins.com to see if there are any BTC sellers in your local area. Maybe you can get in touch with them and see if any are interested in a Mustang for BTC trade. Or you could just post to Craigslist and say you accept BTC. If someone prefers to pay you in cash just buy BTC with it afterward.

My understanding is that over time transaction costs increase and the miners get paid from those.

Ah, I see what you mean. I misunderstood your use of the word "speculation". Thanks for clarifying.

Yes, see lendingclub.com and the like.

Price is a reflection of what people are willing to buy or sell at. That is absolutely the truth.

I'm not sure about your question about the printer's memory. I'd like to hear someone else's informed take on that. However, for a good overview on creating paper wallets and putting your BTC into cold storage, check out this video -

Of course! I figured that went without saying.

Laaaaaaaame. It seems like coinbase has grown it's customer base way faster than they can scale up support. Good luck, I hope you manage to get in touch and sort out the problem.

Finally received the confirmation email. **54 minutes after my first sign in attempt**. Glad I was able to log in, but that is way too long of a delay.

I am having the same issue. I emailed support tonight and received an automated email response within seconds, but the new device confirmation email never came. What's going on @_date: 2017-11-26 18:18:14
Minus the coins that have likely been lost or otherwise inaccessible - estimated to be around 2-4 million.

Cherry picking dates works both ways though. In the big picture there are only a few short windows where you could have bought BTC and be at a loss now. Basically, you had to buy around the ATHs of Dec 2017 to Jan 2018, or this past summer of 2019 when we've been up in the 10k+ range. That's pretty much it. Gold is much more stable, yes, but it's an asset that's reliably scarce and has been around for thousands of years. Also, gold does not increase in value. Rather, fiat currencies lose value in comparison to gold. A subtle but important difference.

Everyone thinks they're smart until they get arrested by the grammar police.
Everyone's -- e.g "\*Everyone is\* a tough guy..."

Wrench swinging doesn't scale well. So good luck with that.

No problem. Just as easy as when we won the war on drugs all those decades ago.

David Bowie's Golden Years was playing in my head as I read this post. I've been waiting for this. Can't wait to take her for a test drive. Here's hoping it drives like a Porche and not a Pinto!

Carper doesn't seem to understand that government will never be able to keep up with free market forces over the long term. Bureaucrats are destined to fall further and further behind despite their rhetoric.

Not sure if Schiff is just incredibly stubborn or a brilliant devil's advocate. Fantastic post!

Altcoins lag behind btc pretty much every time there is a bull run.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:15:26
This is a good point. What percentage of the population owns BTC? I'm guessing it's a period followed by lots of zeros and then a small integer. That makes for a lot of potential upside.
