10 Months ago I asked MtGox if they were running a fractional exchanger. [They assured everyone they were not!](
Oh, the times we live in!

Great news! In what juridisction will this bank be located?

This is a fantastic idea! Personal accounts would be setup by traders, consumers, etc. While corporate accounts would be opened by exchangers, escrow companies or even regular businesses that want to accept bitcoin payments.
You will also get a lot of traction with traders and arbitrage people. They need to move fiat and bitcoin quickly between exchanges. Having the funds actually sit in a bank instead of each exchanger would speedup that process immensly. 
In the medium/long future, most bitcoin transactions will take place off the blockchain. Humans make mistakes, and the unreversible nature of bitcoin makes mistakes very costly. I think bitcoin is a fantastic settlement mechanism, but we also need a clearing mechanism. Your bank will provide this clearing mechanism. If you need a good software developer to help out, I am your man!
The bitcoin economy infrastructure is almost non-existant at the moment. Lots of money to be made by building all of this.

When you send your bitcoins to any exchanger, you have effectively traded your bitcoins for a promise to repay bitcoins. Same thing with the fiat. A fractional exchanger could spend those coins (or fiat) elsewhere, leaving you with simply an IOU. The fractional exchanger would then only hope that not everyone withdraws at the same time. 
Glad to hear mtgox does no such thing.

Does mtgox run as a fractional exchange? Meaning, do you have 100% of the bitcoins your users have deposited in your system?

I am wondering what kind of software do you need to run a bank?
* Interface software to move fiat to/from other banks (SWIFT/SEPA/Dwolla/???)
* Money flow software to track all the money going in and out of user's accounts
* KYC software, to track all of the user's details
* AML software to detect suspucious transactions
* Billing and invoicing software to charge fees to your customers
* Loan management software, to track who owes you money, and how much of it
I am most likely missing much here. What else?

I agree it is a crazy thing to do. But simply re investing a fraction of their customer's deposit can  yield a very nice return. Bitfinex had loans requests with 1000% yield. Pretty tempting!
