Quick note about SHA-3: Yes, this is an entirely new standard which has been selected by NIST via their hash function competition[1]. It has the advantage over SHA-2 in that it is not a Merkle-Damgard[2] construction, and therefore not vulnerable to length-extension attacks[3]. However, it is a very new type of structure from a cryptographic point of view and it is not recommended that SHA-3 be used in production yet until is has been subject to more extensive cryptanalysis. If you need a cryptographic hash, then it is recommended to use SHA-2 instead (at least for now). However, for password storage you should use a password-based key derivation function instead (see my top-level post).

Here's a comparison of various secure chat applications and how they hold up against governments: 
Also, If you want to chat securely, I would recommend chatting Jabber/XMPP using Pidgin which supports proper OTR encryption:  Otherwise you depend on Crypto.Cat being trustworthy.

Information security specialist here.
You should make sure you store the passwords using a hash function specifically designed for password storage, these are called password-based key derivation functions. Generally speaking, a password-based key derivation function is a cryptographic hash with additional salting and hash-stretching built-in to counter the generally low entropy found in passwords and slow down password cracking. Do not attempt to use a cryptographic hash such as SHA-1/2/3 directly, or build your own password-based key derivation function. Instead you should use **existing, proven functions** such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt/scrypt.
With that being said, good security goes above and beyond password storage. You need to make sure everything else is secure too, since the security of your site is only as good as the security of your weakest link.

Sorry, but I'm currently too busy for side-jobs. I can highly recommend the Security StackExchange[1] if you need to ask questions on security related stuff though.
