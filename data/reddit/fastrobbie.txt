Learn and teach others.
Be informed and spread the word. Best way to fight against the chills.

What/who is causing the sudden spike?

Respect man! Things like this make me believe again!

Personnaly I'd recommend a hardware wallet or a wallet on a disconnected drive/usb.
Exchanges will be hacked again and some people will lose money. Do you want to be one of the victims? Do not take any risk with your funds, whatsoever. And what might be 3k today, might be much more in a few years. 
Educate yourself how to store your crypto funds yourself, offline.
Only store online what you intend to spend/trade with.

Give it some time. You should see it coming up in your electrum, just needs some time for confirmations.

Probably one of the best decisions you might you make in your life. Do not focus on the amount.
Note the probably, nothing is certain.

In all honesty, I would advice to store it on a hardware wallet (if you can afford one) or store it on an external usb/disk and keep it offline.
Security is not to be taken lightly when managing your own funds.

There are a few around. Those I hear most about are KeepKey, Trezor and Nano Ledger s. They come around 65-99$ without tax.
They are the most safe option, especially for non-technical people!

Many of us have been at the same spot you are at now. I'm 99,99% confident that over some course of time you'll be one happy person

For buying I would suggest BitStamp.
Obviously you do not want to store your funds online ...

In my personal opinion:
* Security issues with theft
* Possibly quantum computing
* Too much community division (bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin2x, ...). It brings fear and uncertainty and at some point investors might get saturated with it

If the seed is all what you need to recreate your funds in the wallet, is the seed usable over all wallets or only the one specific wallet your created the seed with?
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:58:18
The seed generates the private root key if I understand correct?
This private root key can be used to generate all private keys to the corresponding addresses for the private root key? And those private keys are the actual ones that are being used to sign transactions?
What I don't understand why that seed is only vallet for one wallet? If your seed always generates the same exact root private key, would it not just generate the same one in another wallet?
