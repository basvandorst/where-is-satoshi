You are behaving like an arsehole.
At no point did I say I regular PC could even crack DES in a few days. I said that building a DES cracker was now affordable for a committed hobbyist, and that many researchers already possess such machines.
As such, given that finding a 2^56 DES key is feasible, and that finding 2^56 bits is the same computational complexity (i.e. it has the same big-O) then cracking that will be similarly feasible in the very near future.
You're acting smug because you think you've proved your point. You haven't, you're just a very intellectually dishonest person:


I won't be replying further.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:23:36
I also realise the source of some of our disagreement:
I misread "2^60 seconds" as "2^60 keys" in an earlier comment, and we've been arguing different points ever since.
Yes 2^60 is an insanely large figure corresponding to 2.2 billion years.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:07:49


That's totally undefined. What is "partial"? Cos if it's 20 bits missing, that's really fucking feasible, even now.


Also totally undefined, I'm really bored of this conversation now though.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:01:05
You just massively reduced the security of your private key, every bit that is visible reduces the search time by half.
Transfer this to another address before you get rekt.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:36:28
The point, put very simply, is that if 2^56 DES keys is feasible and 2^56 ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is not, it will be a very, very short amount of time until Moore's law makes it feasible, since the difference between them is linear, and computing power grows exponentially. Really basic stuff, I dunno why we're arguing it. The fact that ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is more complex doesn't really make it all that much harder to search the keyspace, since both DES and ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 have a fixed amount of operations to compute.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:10:30
Good job
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:25:39


No, it isn't.


Let's simplify this, to check 2^56 DES keys is a constant multiple of the time it takes to check 2^56 SHA-256 inputs. That multiple is the same multiple of the difference in time between 1 DES key and 1 SHA-256 input. To compute a SHA-256 hash is a fixed number of computational steps, so is DES. To compute n SHA-256 hashes is a fixed multiple of computing n DES encryptions.
Therefore, if you already know all but 56 of the input to that SHA-256 function (that produces a given hash), to find that hash is a linear multiple of the number of operations to find the DES key: 2^56 * (the number of operations to calculate a single DES/SHA-256).
You seem to understand big-O and computability theory so I don't know why you don't seem to understand this. Both DES and SHA-256 can be computed in polynomial time (and exponential time to reverse).


Not relevant to your point: which is that he didn't need to, and that he'd lost a negligible amount of security, which is totally false, he'd reduced his keyspace by 2^n (where n is the number of keybits revealed). That's a significant loss of security even if still infeasible to compute. To pretend that all key-lengths above some arbitrary value are basically equivalent is outright wrong.
Edit: and stop downvoting all the responses before replying, it just makes you look like a petty idiot who only cares about "winning".
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:30:20
I don't care. The amount of extra computation to do ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is linear compared with doing a DES encryption.
If I compromise any bits of my private key, I'm moving my funds.
Being paranoid is cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:27:34


That was never ever the point, and saying that is moving the goalposts. The point was about calculating a SHA-256 hash were you know n bits of input.


You just called the entire field of computability theory stupid, which is one of the most foundational pieces of mathematical theory in computer science.

I don't possess the kind of equipment I'm referring to. And I haven't calculated out of hand how many bits of private key are remaining. It should be 56 to be what we were referring to.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:03:21
I poorly worded that and I corrected it longer than 12 minutes ago. So I dunno why you're using the original wording.
The difference in execution time to check a DES key vs to check ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is linear.
Not: the difference between cracking vastly different key lengths that those algos have. The whole point refers to revealing enough private key bits to make the keyspace a similar order of magnitude to DES.
Your point is that DES is one hardware-small set of operations and ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is much larger.
The amount of operations to compute one ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is a constant multiple of one DES computation.
Again, as I've said like a hundred times, if I compromise any part of my key, I'm moving my funds, and advising others to do the same. To do anything otherwise, regardless of back-of-the-envolope feasibility calculations for the equivalent keyspace, is reckless given how easy it is to move your funds to a new address.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:12:59
You need to learn some computability theory. In computability we only care about the Big-O: i.e. the largest term that dominates the calculation of time from input, and we don't care about the constants.
The increase in computational complexity (i.e. extra time to calculate) of computing 1 more DES key, and one more ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is linear. That's all there is to it.
The difference between computing 1 DES key and one ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is nothing like those differences of magnitude.
Sorry. I'm done with this conversation, it's ridiculous.
Revealing large numbers of keybits is a very serious reduction in security, that is a trivially true fact, and if calculating 2^56 DES keys is feasible, then calculating 2^56 ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD160+SHA256+SHA256 is similarly feasible. Those are not, on their own, complex algos to calculate. They can also be pipelined in hardware. This is by design, they're meant to be efficient to calculate and infeasible to reverse, by design.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:28:36
 Please show me where I said normal-ish.
8 years ago you could build a DES cracker for $10,000, that could get an answer within 2 weeks guaranteed.
You wouldn't sink the cost just for this address, but if you're a researcher with access to a device like this, it's absolutely worth trying to reconstruct the rest of the key.
Admittedly DES is far smaller in hardware than many other algorithms, but that isn't the point.
There are actually gaps in his scribble that reveal a huge number of bits of key if you look carefully.
You're all basically being pedantic arseholes at this point, do not reveal any bits of your private key. It's not fucking difficult advice to follow.
It's completely irresponsible to be telling people that doing this results in an insignificant reduction in security.

"N/A" with a tooltip that explains there's boundless inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:50:11
I disagree. I favour the more Austrian interpretation of a classic central bank credit bubble.
It was so cheap to borrow money for speculation because of central bank actions (price fixing of the inflation rate). Your analysis is correct, but there's an extra step back along the cause and effect chain available. Setting the borrowing rate so low created what appeared to be an arbitrage opportunity. And of course the more people pile in to the arb opportunity (which isn't allowed to close via the normal supply/demand mechanisms because of central bank price fixing) then it inflates until a breaking point occurs where the system can no longer sustain the contradiction. Edit: At this point the malinvestments must be liquidated (a recession). This isn't my view. It's a pretty standard Austrian School view.
If borrowing had been properly priced by the market then it's likely it wouldn't have gotten so out of control. The speculative bubble was fuelled by cheap money.
I'm sure you'll have a rebuttal to this point, but this post will have to stand on its own merits because I need to crack on and can't waste another evening getting sucked into another of these kinds of discussions.

The best way to do this is two new columns:
* one for fully diluted (i.e. current price * number of tokens that *will ever* be in existence / 21 million)
* current bitcoin equivalence (current price * number of tokens in circulation / number of bitcoins in circulation)
Both of those tell you different things, since coins don't have the same issuance/inflation profiles as bitcoin.
At the height of the ripple pump, it actually overtook bitcoin by the first metric briefly. That would have communicated to the noobs and CNBC viewers just how over-pumped it already was, instead of all the "hurr durr, it's only $3, that's cheap, could go to $1000 like bitcoin".

Well, the mining centralisation is fairly certain to occur with unlimited blocks, that is for sure. And that is a bad thing.
However, it's an educated guess that the lightning networks can be kept from becoming the "know your customer layer" in reality. We don't know how that'll happen until we watch it play out.
I say that as a supporter of SegWit and lightning networks and very excited about them.
But anyone who says they know for sure which trade off is the best one for decentralisation has been spending too much time in one of our two beautiful echo chambers.

You're right, but tbh, there are also no right on wrongs on technical issues, only trade-offs towards particular ends.
The conflict is this:
You're making it more centralised by making it harder to operate a full node! Only server farms with enormous bandwidth will be able to validate the chain! Off chain scaling is the only way to ensure decentralisation!
No you're making it more centralised because lightning nodes will be banks! On chain scaling is the only solution to ensure decentralisation!
The correct technical choice is based on: which risk are you more willing to bear, miner/full-node centralisation or layer-2 node centralisation? This is a subjective guess, and it's why the community has split in two.

I'm not here to argue which is correct tbh. And I did actually see a highly upvoted post in a while ago which said that malleability is a feature and not a bug (specifically because it prevents layer 2) and shouldn't be fixed at all. I know this isn't the majority view of big blockers.

Don't overthink it, just reverse your def of hard and soft fork in the original.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:30:29
It's not, he's got it backwards.
A Hard fork makes previously invalid blocks valid (meaning un-upgraded nodes will reject the new blocks). At this point the chain splits.
A Soft fork makes previously valid blocks invalid (i.e. it places new restrictions on what blocks are considered valid). This means that unupgraded nodes will not see the tightened-rules blocks as invalid. It is important though that all miners upgrade, since the unupgraded miners may start producing blocks that break the newly-tightened rules.
Contrary to misconception, both types of fork can cause a chain split.
Hard forks need everyone to upgrade before the fork.
Soft forks need all miners to upgrade before the fork (but not all nodes).

Mate, I dunno who you're trying to persuade, I'm in favour of lightning, but mesh net routing is by no means a "solved" problem. It's an area of very active research. How well the current LN routing algo scales will remain to be seen. The network is still small enough to find an optimal route via brute force, that's a whole different ballgame to a global payment network.


Yes, but this is an NP hard problem that grows exponential to the number of nodes in the network. I'm not really interested in circle jerking here about how all the problems are solved and everything is perfect, cos that's not the case right now.

Mesh network routing is a really, really hard problem tbh, and Tor doesn't scale amazingly well if a lot more people were using it.
The problem is that people take "optimal solutions are computationally infeasible to find" as "it's impossible".
Lightning and Tor provide incentives for research into better algorithms and heuristics to solve this routing problem (where the algorithms will necessarily produce suboptimal results, but good enough is good enough), and I'm confident we'll do well at it, because this is the first time there's been a large amount of money contingent on solving the problem.

That isn't the point being made. The point is about the scalability of onion routing/meshnets as a general problem, nothing to do with encryption.
The reason regular internet routing is easy is because IPs are assigned hierarchically as a tree. Mesh net routing is really difficult. Tor routing is considerably easier than lightning routing because you don't care which exit node you use, and entry/relay nodes can connect with any other node without having to set up channels etc beforehand.
Tor routing is "pick an entry node, pick a relay node, pick an exit node" and you don't care at all which, you just select randomly.
Lightning/meshnet routing is: find me a path from A to B via open channels with enough capacity for my transaction where the network topology is fluid and ad hoc. This is an active, and difficult, area of research.

If you're ok with that, go ahead, but I implore you to examine your thought processes because you view things entirely the wrong way around.
If your BTC drops well below your buy in price, you shouldn't be selling, you should be buying more to average down. If you have 100% of your savings in BTC, you have zero margin for error.
If you sell as soon as it drops below your buy in (it probably will at some point) then you are setting yourself up for a guaranteed loss.
