What the...? They even know what is Bitcoin? 
Well, if they look at the internet for a while, they gonna accept instantly. xD

Probably some exchanges asked for it to have more liquidity. In another words, more players are coming.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:20:56
Well, i'm ready for another rally. 20k or bust!
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:51:36
We gonna have a rally in the next hours

The anonymous trader deposite some BTC in his/her wallet every month, since last december.
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:04:09
Liquidity = higher pump or dump
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:51:05
300M USDT was just printed!

Would be great if some whales appear in the next few hours, creating a strong support point at 9k.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:53:44
The dip was weaker than the feb one.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:43:10
Of course, we need to create a higher support point, would be great if it reaches at 9k. Then, we'll be able to break some resistances.

China's new central-bank chief, Yi Gang, promised to implement changes quickly, saying “there will be a series of reform and opening-up measures” during the next three weeks.
Pump in the next week, after this, the announcement: the chinese regulation. If it really happens, so we gonna have a rally at April.

We gonna break the 10k mark again! We need to have a good volume to create a huge support point.

That was the last bull flag, guys! To the moon!
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:15:13
I hope so. The lowest 24h price is about to rise, forcing the market to take a decision: pumping hard to 8k or to dump to 6k.

Well, it seems that the downtrend is about to end. The dip is raising and the 7200 resistance is easy to break.
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:35:56
Another bull flag forming.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:01:16
Is India protecting their banks from a FOMO that could break them?

It's only about trending analysis 
About the last 24hrs:
High: 7125
Low: 6740
Avg: 6900-7000
The distance between H and L can get even lower, what can sounds a kind of stabilizaton. But we still at a downtrend, what may sounds like a trap (bear or bull).
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:22:27
I think we can expect for awesome news this week.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:02:40
The pressure emerges as far as the lowest and the highest 24h prices aproaches from the other.
