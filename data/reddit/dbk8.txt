I mean. Can I recover the copay seed in a different wallet like bread or electrum. Etc 
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:20:51

What if I have the old copay app. Should I update it ?
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:48:55
I was reading the it was owned by the guy who is supporting bitcoin cash and that the app could potentially send it to the wrong address.  Some articles said that now the app is asking for the security pass phrase when they never set one.  Some articles said they ran into errors and not to update the app.  Some say copay doesnt work and to use bitpay.   Just trying to figure out.

I mean if you have a mortgage. And then we enter a situation like Venezuela.  And theres millions out there literally on the streets.  Then one could pay off mortgages and cc relatively quickly. Right?
And if that's the case. It will never happen in America.  Never
