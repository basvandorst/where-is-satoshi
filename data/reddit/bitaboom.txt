nobody deserves what happened to them, But when you're trading on a site that is 100.00 above everyone else trading the same thing that was clue number one..and if they left their money in gox because someone on a chat board told them not to panic that doesn't even deserve a response!..
Think for yourselves the warning signs were all there each one had a siren blast with it

all ten of them came back with a different result..
our tax system is a joke and set up so no matter how you file and what you claim you could be still wrong and end up in jail or big fines/penalties..sorta like our war on drugs?.the only thing it solves is money flowing to the top 1% for building more prisons now full of non-violent drug addicts

 Yesterday, NoFiatCoin announced that Bitcoins (BTC) can now be exchanged for NoFiatCoins (XNF). This development is perhaps one of the most beneficial to the public so far. Not only will adopters have access to the Ripple Network through this service, but very importantly, they'll also be able to take advantage of the already established infrastructure that Bitcoin offers, one of them being the use of ATMs and the possibility to quickly go from X to cash and vice-versa.

Angela Angelovska Wilson, a lawyer at Latham &amp; Watkins specializing in alternative payment systems, said that Ripple’s more centralized control had allowed it to benefit from some of the bad press surrounding bitcoin, while maintaining the benefits of a decentralized currency.
“Obviously bitcoin was the first mover,” Ms. Wilson said. “But Ripple was right behind it. And then there are a lot of others coming through.”
