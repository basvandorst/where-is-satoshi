Dude you honestly have no life lmfao. How does it feel being a loser I wouldn’t know that feeling.

Classic boomers
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:43:12
Lmfao thanks for the laughs 
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:29:46
Yea then it lost its value lmfao. You prob didn’t cash out quick enough. The ride up probably was enjoyable for you but I bet the ride down wasn’t that much of a thrill.

I didn’t invest in bitcoin cause the bitcoin bubble was so ez to spot.  Y’all need some glasses.

Read below about the guy who lost all his life savings. I know it’s easy to skim through the first paragraph and make your thesis about it. What’s more trusted a banking system that’s been active for many years or a new fad?

Lmfao You can’t call a cardboard box on the street a bitcoin bank. The only time We’ll see in the future is when your begging for money on the street and I’ll ask you if bitcoin okay?  Maybe you’ll have your bitcoin wallet qr code on the cup. Man bitcoin tech is crazy.
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:06:07
Come on man cut the bs. We all know your fake af. You’ve been called out so many times it’s honestly just sad to see. I know the only thing bigger than the 3 cents you invested in bitcoin is your ego.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:34:54
Lmfao. Yea I don’t know what will happen in 10 years but I can guarantee that you still have to pay all the real loans that you took out for  your “crypto investments”. On your next payment ask if they’ll accept bitcoin. Those bankers will have a jolly good laugh.

Yep buddy you caught me I’m actually MacNfee. Lmao get a job.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:36:37
Do you mean like this guy. [he had the same idea]( .
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:22:57
You’re telling me that the wallets are insecure. What really I would’ve never thought. Man only if I put my money into something that’s more trusty like an actual bank account.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:58:48
Yea don’t worry I already know lmfao.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:42:11
Lmfao, Yea. It’s like saying a vpn is the Declaration of Independence from the NSA.
Just admit that you guys took an L back in 2017. If the world goes to shit crypto currency won’t be used. If anything humans will go back to the good old days of trading goods for other goods.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:27:41
Dang bro why do you have to bring suicide into this my brother killed himself last summer. Bro that’s low.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:20:50
Lmfao ok sure buddy if you want to keep this bs up longer. I’m actually a super billionaire on my golden yacht right now. I own all the land that your buildings are purchased on. Currently I’m snorting cocaine off a hooker tits.  Let’s be real if you were some a big shot why are you arguing over the internet with a no body. Wait I have a theory idk if it’s true or not, but hear me out. I actually think your a loser who has nothing better to do than argue over some bad investments you made. Your not a hot shot business invested but rather a keyboard warrior.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:59:26
Watching you guys is even funnier. It’s like watching an idiot stepping on every pile of shit he sees and hoping that the next shit he steps in won’t smell like shit. Don’t worry we don’t have to wait ten years. By next year we’ll see how bad it’s gotten.
@_date: 2019-02-13 05:14:44
Lmfao this whole subreddit doesn’t understand the financial, banking systems and basic economics. Lmfao gtfo out of her dumbo.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:11:32
Mad or nah?
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:13:48
Let me tell you what actually happened. The “losers” aka your mom told you not to invest in bitcoin at 15k. You didn’t listen to her and now your a janitor at a motor shop. Congrats for showing me a true loser. I wouldn’t know the feeling living paycheck to paycheck.
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:06:34
Congrats for winning the lotto in investing. However do you think bitcoin would rise 300% in the future. A year before bitcoin was around 10k but know it’s at 3k. How does that sound like a good investment? Lmfao. It doesn’t matter what it was 10 years ago. Admit you just fell into the bubble. The people who don’t know what they are talking about are people who are saying that bitcoin is the future. It’s not.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:09:25
Haha yea sure ok buddy. You can be whatever you want on the internet. Being employed as a janitor 5 times for 5 different buildings doesn’t make you a CEO.  Also how do your employees feel when 1% of their pay is depreciating in value?
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:15:21
Lmfao you really are mentally disabled aren’t you? You didn’t win jack shit. I could also go to my bosses garage and ask him to take a video of his cars. I can’t believe you actually did that lmfao. Man must be sad to be you.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:00:19
!Remind me in 1 year!
@_date: 2018-11-13 04:23:54
“When” lmfao.
