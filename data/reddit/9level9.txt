**HAS** [**BLOCKCHAIN.COM**]( **BEEN COMPROMISED!!!**
I received spam mail on July 3 and again on July 7 that was a ransom threat that said my computer had been compromised because I used a browser that wasn't updated.  My browser stays updated.  The email said if I don't send $800 dollars in BTC to a certain wallet that they would share video from my web cam of me "pleasuring myself" and other embarrassing information they collected on me with my contacts.  That didn't bother me because I know it's BS.  What did bother me was that they had my email address and a specific password that I use.  
I have passwords for 75+ different sites and try to use a different password for each one.   **I only used the password that was in the ransom ware for one site:**  [**BLOCKCHAIN.COM**](
What I find interesting is that there's a post in this very group from "**Jade (Blockchain) May 8, 14:53 EDT**" that eerily talks about sites posing as [blockchain.com]( that would seem to explain how my account got compromised.  **HOWEVER**, since creating the [blockchain.com]( account in 2017 I've logged into that account maybe twice and haven't logged into that account in over a year.  I'm glad I didn't have any crypto in the wallet I created because that would have surely been stolen like others have reported in this group.
This leads me to believe that [BlockChain.com]( has been compromised **OR** they are stealing from their users by either taking the crypto directly out of their wallets or threatening them with ransom ware.  Either way,  BE CAUTIOUS WITH [BLOCKCHAIN.COM](  I for one WILL NOT ever log into or visit that site again.
I've been in the I.T. field for the last 20 years and have been in crypto since 2013.  I'm just sharing my experience in case this is happening to others.

Sorry they got you.   Please see the comment I posted.  To see someone with my email and password made me do a search to see if others had received ransom ware related to [blockchain.com]( and this is how I came across this group and your post.  I rarely post comments on sites and didn't have a Reddit account.  But after getting that ransome ware email, I felt I had to share this.  Hope you recovered your funds.
