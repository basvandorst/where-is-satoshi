When was this? I'm hesitant on opening tickets because I've heard they're flooded with people asking for assistance and many times they don't even reply

it's actually as easy to drive as a normal automatic gearbox car

I sent 2 EUR haha, it said "small amount" so figured it would suffice. How come they never verified your account? Don't they need to verify your account to deposit funds? On settings I have linked my bank account but it's not verified and I can't do anything with it

My recommendation would be to forget about it and check back once every couple of weeks. Don’t get sucked in the constant checking of the news, values etc and don’t get into fantasies of big money

Yeah you have to watch yourself a bit. Cheers mate, good luck

Noob here, one question. I get that given an address and a private key one can access a wallet's content, but how does one do it with just seed words? You would need to use software that converts them into hexadecimal right? 
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:22:18
so a seed contains both public and private keys? what app/website/software/hardware wallet is needed to access a seed and generate a seed with your current public and private keys? I know mycelium uses a seed but I thought that was just a way to backup
