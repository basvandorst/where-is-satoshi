Well people who complain are those who bought at all time high in December and January, Btc has increased about x5 times from its value a year ago today. No other asset group can ever get you that profit. I got my stack in 2016 when it was less than $700, so I guess I’m still happy about what’s happening now. Anyway I don’t intend to sell until it hits 100k mark��

It’s a joke if you think btc is ever going below $6000. People are much more aware of its potentials than in previous years

Use localbitcoins.com

Well, if you are smart enough you’d get a hardest wallet. Coinbase is safe until they fuck up but then it’ll be too late for you.

What’s the point here anyway, cos all money is just paper with nothing to back them with. Even bitcoin is nothing if people suddenly decide it’s worthless. The most important thing is that once it becomes acceptable as a means of exchange for another asset it also become an asset.

It’s really suspicious how he says he’s been hacked. Hasn’t he heard of 2FA and stuff like that? People will do anything just to avoid taxes������

That’s such a stupid decision. I guess they’ll stop operating when all their customers decide to buy bitcoins
