What would happen if I lost this device? That's my concern
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:51:06
I was about to reply snarkily by saying "but it would be somewhere innocuous like on my inner thigh"
But then I pictured someone cutting a square out of my inner thigh...
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:51:23
I am in control of my body. Having a physical record burnt into my skin in an innocuous location, my inner thigh, for example, would be preferable to hosting the file with a company that I have no control over. What happens if they go bust, for example?
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:49:59
It would be encrypted, I wouldn't just have a QR of a plain private key
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:52:30
It seems that QR code tattoos are relatively common, but require a very skilled artist to ensure they are readable.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:18:17
This is a good idea, but I can't see how you would be able to scan it.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:28:21


I am essentially homeless, I have no fixed address.


Fair enough, but a wallet is easily stolen or lost.


With good encryption and 2FA this is probably safe enough, but I want to be in control of the file, I'd rather not have it on someone else's server.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:54:48
It wouldn't be for day-to-day use, but for long-term savings.
I guess eventually I would be left with a useless tattoo, but the same can be said for most people who get one ;)
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:57:26
Cool, I will look into this
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:19:44
Yeah I think they are 6 months late, lots of restlessness in the forums and the mods are being really unprofessional about it, calling people names, etc.
Edit: Butterfly labs is still down for me

I had 4 bitcoins that I paid a neat £25 for each.
Just sold 2.5 at a very lucky £39.something for just under £100 (original investment), leaving 1.5 coins as 'profit'. I am going to leave that £100 in my account and wait for a slight drop, otherwise I will cash it out to pay bills and sit on my measly 1.5 and see where it goes!
Edit: oops, real life. In that case, the last thing I used bitcoins for was a rather sizeable drugs purchase of MDMA, Ketamine, Weed and Amphetamines... Sorry for giving the coins a bad name!
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:14:59
Every time I explain Bitcoin to my friends they ask me the same question: "So it's the currency from WoW right?" Sometimes a child is more receptive to information than grown men...
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:43:31
Well in a perfect system the value of the lost bitcoins would be displaced by a corresponding increase in value per, so in practice I guess it wouldn't matter a huge amount. I bet it spawns an industry of people who search for lost coins when the value is great enough, imagine finding a wallet file containing 0.5BTC when they are worth $10k...

I moved what little net assets I have out of a low-interest UK bank that has a history of exploding and getting bailed out. Does that count?

Trucking number? If you were half literate maybe you would make some money from a scam like this. Butterfly Labs may be dubious, but what you are offering is plain non-existent.
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:12:53
Great idea, sounds like is already there. I'd be prepared to put some work into promoting this with a new username. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:20:38
First off, this looks awesome. Nothing I am about to say detracts from that.
It seems strange that there have been so many depictions of bitcoins as a traditional physical currency, I see the appeal (the are bit*coins* after all), but I would love to see some art depicting BTC as something a bit more futuristic. Galactic credits anyone?
On the same note, the motto is clearly an ironic reference to "In God we Trust", let's face it, most of us put more trust in cryptography than we do God - believer or not. We *do* trust the cryptography, that's what makes bitcoins such a strong concept, but they are designed to break with conventional fiats, and for this reason I prefer the alternative "Vires in Numeris" as someone else has mentioned.
Are there any other popular mottos? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:02:29
Bitcoins will be a problem because the gov won't be *able* to mess around with them too much. They will get bored. We can't have that. How else will our economy survive without the magic potion-stirring Chancellor of the Exchequer making sure everything is going so well?
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:14:03
This led me to Nick Clegg's facebook, wtf?

Thanks, although a bit longwinded, this seems like a good method
@_date: 2013-03-10 17:16:54
I've been wondering about this. It seems like it would already be quite easy to slip off the grid, taking all payment in bitcoins. Sure it would be a huge hassle at the moment, but given how fast businesses are beginning to take it up I bet that it wouldn't be too much of a problem in a few years.
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:22:06
Fuck up, get stung. 
If you stick to the rules you would be fine, but it happens from time to time.

So embarrassing seeing these "oh good going man, here's my wallet address so, you know, you can give me something for free despite not knowing the first thing about me nor me you."
Will you be using this account to make updates in the future? I'd love to hear how you use the money.

This genuinely gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. One of the things I love about BTC is the microphilanthropy. It makes me generous, it makes others generous, because the more we share the better things get. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:22:40
So I should be selling my bitcoins for euros? Seems like a good idea.

But bro, he has a 'trucking number', so he can't be a scammer.

An interesting variation on the theme would be for people doing research that will be made available to the public for free, and getting tips from redditors who take an interest, or might like to use the data.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:00:38
On the website there is a forum link that does not work.
There are no google results apart from the site, I'm pretty it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:07:31
Wow, yeah. What happens when people start basing amounts of the bitcoin circulation on gold as a sort of insurance against price crashes...
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:31:25
My point being that I have explained a number of times to my friends what they are, and they still have this fixed idea that carries a negative prejudice.

Yeah I'm having to cash in with blockchain (and their 5% commission), then transfer over to Gox. It's a pain in the ass. 
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:56:06
I don't think it could ever work, so they government takes 5m bitcoins out of circulation, wouldn't the price double to adjust for it?

Dodgy Dealer A wants to transfer $1,000,000 of ill-gotten gains to Dodgy Dealer B. If he is an idiot he will do this in one massive transaction that will clearly stand-out. If he is wise, he will use many addresses to transfer small amounts to many recipient addresses. I'm sure this could be automated to the point that it would take a huge amount of time to find each transaction and pin it to one individual.

The less I have to do with USD the better. Whilst I'm afraid for what this might do to confidence building in Bitcoin, it may also drive people towards the idea of Bitcoins as an ecosystem in their own right, rather than a commodity to be speculated upon.
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:19:02
I can't find anywhere decent to buy litecoins... Not sure if it is worth it but I would kick myself if they ever took off.
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:12:33
Yeah, if the gov started buying up Bitcoins it would bankrupt them. There is no limit to their value, they would effectively just be handing out money to people around the world. Let them try!
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:55:48
Rationality doesn't come into it. I've drawn them diagrams, man!
Although they probably think I'm trying to sell the snake oil...

If you want to go big, you could try and set up an anonymous banking service. I'm sure something like this already exists, but I think it has enormous potential.
Arrive at the site, 'sign up', download a software client, access accounts through that. Ability to transfer money to bitcoin wallets, other accounts and normal bank accounts. The difference between this and a glorified BC wallet? Interest, just like any other bank. 
On your end, you operate a currency exchange, which would provide you access to real tender, trade it as a commodity, use it to buy more bitcoins, invest it IRL, whatever. You also have access to a mass of bitcoins which can be used to invest in bitcoin specific projects, you could potentially even croudsource the task of investment based on a levelling system but maybe that is too far...
This isn't something I just came up with, I'd love to try it but I have no programming skills, and negative amounts of money at the present. I (handwrote) a document with my vague schematic for this project a few months ago. So you know I'm legit!
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:04:30

How does this make it 'enslavement' though. I think if you said this to a slave in the 1840s he might give you a funny look... 
"This decentralised digital currency will lead to our *enslavement* because one person owns a quarter of the supply"
Not enslavement, but it is an interesting point.
