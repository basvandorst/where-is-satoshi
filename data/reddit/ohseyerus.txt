Tell me more about the new address that is under my in which change is sent to. This happens with each transaction. So do I have many addresses with bitcoin in them that I can access? How can I access them?

The day before I have a transfer from my exchange wallet to my mycelium wallet 0.0060745 the only transaction for the day on the mycelium wallet. My wallet doesn't show a transaction of 0.00034915 to or from. So maybe not as simple as I initially thought.

Maybe I'm not understanding.

I copied and pasted it, but why all the confirmations?

The $5 transaction did not necessarily  come from or to the mycelium wallet then?

I use mycelium, electrum, wirex, and a couple others. This one I used mycelium.

It would be worse if it was malware imo, which it probably is, because the btc amount doubled  nearly from $39 USD to $69 USD granted a portion of that is miners fees, and subsequently went to 2 different addresses not including the mining address. My question is at which point did it happen? One would assume it was a copy  buffer that the thief injected their address into copy command, but from my end? Or the vendor end? Yeah it's probably my end. You're right. I have some work to do..

My wallet doesn't reflect a transaction from the day before?

Man that is good news I suppose. So it is the exchange that I transferred my funds from, I sent them back to the exchange so they can just send them back to me, or add them to my exchange wallet because exchange rates are crazy high. Man you are a wizard,  I need friends like you. Thank you for taking your time to help me out.
