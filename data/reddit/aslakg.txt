Brilliant! I'm going there in three weeks :)

I believe you are wrong. It's not credit because you have to actually lock up the funds on the blockchain
@_date: 2015-05-20 11:14:24
Yes, they're a couple of horse

How do SPV wallets work in terms of space usage?
They grow with time, grow only if I perform transactions, or what? 
Is it a good idea to move your coins to a fresh wallet from time to time to save space (does it start over in term of how much of the blockchain it stores?) 
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:30:05
Will it work with Apple Pay? Or is this planned? Why not? 
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:53:26
I don't think priced in means the price directly - more indirectly in the sense that it lowers the amounts people would invest in btc as a store of value. Because it could be perceived as a big risk factor. (Satoshi  dumping it all seems unrealistic to me though)

Is there anything the foreign Bitcoin community can do to help grow this in your opinion? 
@_date: 2015-07-28 02:28:02
Apple is looking to expand the reach of Apple Pay so I'm pretty sure they're open for negotiation. Just like they make deals with the banks they make a OneBit needs a deal with them (payments need to be settled between the two). I'm sure Apple takes a cut though. But it would be one way for Apple Pay to go international faster than what they seem to be able to manage on their own....

Even if there is a fork, couldn't you check all branches of it - if the transaction is included and confirmed on all you're pretty safe no?

AFAIK it would be the only way to pay on NFC with iPhone / watch , since there is no public SDK yet for using the NFC hardware  
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:28:11
Do we still need to wait for a malleability fix soft fork? 
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:07:17
Any plans to get this working with Apple Pay? If it's just a virtual credit card all you need is a deal with them perhaps?

Let's say a government starts demanding taxes to be paid in bitcoins. Soon they will have all the bitcoins, since the amount of bitcoins is limited. End of bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-03-28 17:51:33
I'm talking about a government wanting to end bitcoin (because they favour having power over the currency). Obviously if they pay their expenses with bitcoin everything is fine. It doesn't have to be a particularly large government - the total value of all bitcoins in existence if lower than most (all?) goverment tax incomes. It might be cheaper to end it by simply buying all the coins (slowly, to avoid price hike, perhaps with the occasional dump to crash the price now and then).
@_date: 2012-03-29 09:05:35
Sure. But currently the official client does not allow a transfer of 1 mBTC (or less), even if you set the fees to 0.
@_date: 2012-03-28 18:02:07
The atomic units don't help much when you're not allowed to even transfer 1mBTC with the client without paying a 1mBTC fee.
@_date: 2015-09-29 05:26:38
Isn't this a good opportunity to make money? If you do international and/or online business, and charge Bitcoin, you can be very competitive if the price of BTC is 17% higher in Ukraine

Great initiative guys! Upvoted
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:33:16
Great! Going on holiday there soon. No need for bothersome fiat exchanges
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:06:19
Doesn't something like this already exist? Google Ultracoin
@_date: 2013-02-07 14:25:38
And they can order you a Dominos pizza

Classic :)

So, by the height of the wall, if he were to sell into the market, it'd bring the price to 18 something? 
@_date: 2013-02-11 15:06:45
Short term - it'll climb beyond 30 - there's certainly no less interest now than before the big crash. Long term - way up.
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:35:01
Explain this to me...
The difficulty adjusts so that blocks are mined every 10 minutes. On both chains. So how will 0.7 overtake 0.8?
And if it won't, and "everyone" moves to 0.7, won't there be a huge incentive to keep mining on 0.8, since difficulty will drop there?
@_date: 2013-02-24 11:04:36
An ATM converting BTC to cash would have to wait for confirmations for possibly an hour before dispensing the cash. Not very practical.
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:05:58
What about just a normal credit card, but you settle your bills with bitcoin? Then you won't have the problem of currency fluctuation.
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:15:09
You fail to take into account the profit he loses by holding $ cash in the first place. He could have bought bitcoin with the $200.
It does not matter whether you spend bitcoin or dollars, as the two are interchangable.
@_date: 2013-01-21 06:27:45
Better late than never
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:03:21
You swipe your card, buy something for USD/CHF/EUR/GBP. Like a normal credit card. Then you have to pay this back, with interest, like a normal credit card, but you can settle it with bitcoin. Thus currency fluctuation is not a problem (conversion happens when you pay your credit card bill).
@_date: 2013-03-18 09:33:00
There's room for a gateway that could take credit card payments or bitcoin, and pay the merchant in bitcoin (Possibly with a delay that's longer than charge back limit). Neither coinbase or bitpay do this at the moment.
It'd allow for people / businesses without f.ex. US bank accounts to open web shops.
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:18:41
Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:07:40
Thanks. So the branch has that much "time" to overtake, which it should succeed in doing if the mining power there is greater.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:13:27
Not everyone who might be interested in bitcoins have even heard of it yet, let alone been convinced, never mind figured out how to get some.
So there's a lot of pressure upwards - just getting started, in fact.
@_date: 2013-01-21 05:33:02
Remember when you recommend someone like this to accept bitcoin, that you also tell him he could sell the bitcoin he accumulates in the same bar.
His bills would mostly be in Euro anyway, so he'd like to convert (some of) it, and on the other hand people are always looking for ways to get hold bitcoin, and dropping by a bar to get some sounds like a good way.
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:37:06
Aren't blocks produced every 10 minutes on average due to automatic difficulty adjustments? How is 0.7 then supposed to overtake 0.8, unless everyone stops mining on 0.8?
