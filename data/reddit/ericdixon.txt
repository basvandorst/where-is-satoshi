Short term it seems like there is volatility but there are long periods of relative stability. Look at a chart with a longer time horizon than one month. I am not necessarily disagreeing with you, btw. The post poses a question. This is subject to interpretation. Consider the chart from this source and feel free to submit a different chart (different exchanges, different price info)

Another reference for people following this topic is the website, maintained by a large international law firm Davis Polk. The URL is here:   But bitcoin industry players should be wary of using a big law firm as a trusted confidential advisor because Davis Polk represents the largest of the large financial firms, so using them for anything means you have to trust the firm to keep confidential your material and not share it with its much bigger and more powerful clients.

but in which direction? Is the price being supported? Or is it being driven down to permit lower price points for entry?

Find me another lawyer who actually understands bitcoin, or even tries to understand what this is. You have no idea how stuck-in-convention the legal profession tends to be.

Targetpro: I absolutely did send this comment letter directly to Dana Syracuse earlier Friday. All other comments -- people have to do the same!

In short, these regulations seem to present a danger of driving out of the state the very Bitcoin consumers the regulations ostensibly aim to protect. I'm a regulatory lawyer in New York and I think I'll be doing much more work...in New Jersey. [My longer analysis is here.](

Right. The entire regulation, read in its entirety, is fairly clear in exempting the large financial institutions. And as I've actually charged in my comment letter, these are the same institutions which would be the likely future private-sector employers of today's regulators. I'm not implying there is favoritism and an expectation of a returned favor in the future. I am explicitly saying what others can reasonably suspect. Either we have a fair and equal playing field, or we have a rigged game in the casino, it's one or the other and there's no middle ground.

One, there is supposed to be a revised draft, after which there is another comment period that will probably be 30 days. Only after that comment period and the end of the back-and-forth would the "final" regulation be issued. And there's always litigation to try to get an injunction.

Bitcoin could be the perfect evidence. Criminals don't understand that. That's why they get caught.

It's anyone's guess. But once it becomes final, at least according to the latest draft, you have 45 days from its "effective date" to comply by applying for the license. If you don't apply for the license, that 45th day is the day you must stop the prohibited activity under the regulation. Stay tuned.
