Until people start to sell it.

Gold doesn’t generally fluctuate in value by 50-100% in a week. 
Just compare the [Historic prices of gold]( versus the [historic prices of bitcoin]( The bitcoin chart is so obviously a speculative bubble that I can’t believe people are so blind as to not see it. If you are a hodler because you believe bitcoin can replace fiat money, more power to you, but if you are a hodler because you think it will make you rich, you are a speculator gambling on the idea that more people will buy into the hype. 
People invest in gold as a store of wealth because it’s value has, for the most part, tracked with inflation. People seem to be investing in bitcoin because “Do you want to be a millionaire when you’re 30?!? Do you want to be a billionaire by the time you’re 90.”
Bitcoin may eventually have value as a store of wealth, but the price needs to stabalize first, and it’s just as likely the floor will fall out and the bubble will crash to 2013 levels as everyone but the most dedicated leaves.

Nobody is worried that the currency has increased in price by 10% in less than a week?
The crazy price increases scare me way more than they make me want to invest. This thing seems like a bubble ready to pop.

It’s also entirely possible that the us govt slams the door on it because of its affiliation with the blackmarket and then it loses all of its value almost instantly. I hope it continues to do well. I’m just not personally interested in taking the ride.
Also, I came from a top post on r/all. Bitcoin spam has been all over this past week, and I just thought I’d comment my two cents. That’s why I’m here.

“Once it’s price is stable.”
That’s exactly the point. The price isn’t even close to being stable, and until then, you can’t really store value in it because it is simply a bubble that could pop at any moment and leave you high and dry. It is a speculative investment right now, not a store of value.

The point I was making is that the stuff has no inherent value to fall back on. It is a bubble and unless people stop treating it as an investment and start using it as a currency (and I mean on a massively larger scale, like I can go to a drug store and pick up a box of Tylenol and pay with bitcoin), I’m very unconvinced it isn’t just a speculative bubble.
I mean obviously I could end up being very wrong. It could end up actually replacing or reinforcing standard currency and then go on to continue increasing in value. I’m just not at all interested in that kind of risk as an investment.
