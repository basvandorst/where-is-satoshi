I tihnk most people happy spending butcoin are the poeple that invesed early and are seeing crazy gains. Who in their right mind would pay a fee to buy bitcoin, then a fee to send it. All when they could have avoided those 2 extra costs with cash, CC, or paypal. 
Almost every gaming news outlet had an article about the steam situation, maybe this is a good news for next gen crypto.

Bitcoin fails and you call someone cheap? Nice. Kinda crazy we moved to a point where cash and cards are cheaper, faster, more reliable than this new technology called Bitcoin.

Not with BTC. People complain about ebay feees as it is, paying an extra 10 bucks to pay for a 5 dollar item is kinda crazy.

this is why bitcoin fails, miners are greedy, that's why devs wont reduce fees. Fuck you btw for being such an asshole.

Lots of these responses are just excuses but don't address your issues. Bitcoin is propped up by the early adaptors who don't mind ridiculous fees since their swimming in profit anyway. Devs said this won't change, fees aren't important. Remember all devs are more than likely very wealthy so fees are just a drop on the bucket, they have the extra to pay for premium confirmations. Expect the down votes, it's like trying to post anything critical on the ethereum sub.

I'm having the same issue. Bittrex is worse than a bank.

He took money for drug trades. People make him look like a saint but look at the high amounts of overdoses since the darknet markets opened. He is a criminal.

Bit-coiners see the Darketnet markets as a huge reason Bitcoin is successful. They will support anything that drives the price up.
