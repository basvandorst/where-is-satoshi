It was completely intentional. He threw the computer away, having forgotten about his bitcoins.

1 centiBTC = 10 mBTC

My server is a Raspberry Pi, probably couldn't have used it for mining.

I really am starting to feel like you are the guy, with your half-assed attempt at a defense of his idiotic actions.
Listen, he intentionally threw away the PC. He knew the PC had 7,500 Bitcoins on it. Sure, maybe he'd forgotten, but Bitcoin had been going up in value until then. It was in the news. If an IT guy doesn't know this, it's completely his fault. 
Whatever he lost, it was 100% deserved.

I floss like twice a day. I think it's pretty relaxing, and it makes your breath not stink.

Haha, that's got to be the most ignorant "lol only x views but y thumbs up" comment I've ever seen. At least, usually when people don't know what's going on, they don't try to explain it.

Too bad verification takes like half an hour...

I only glanced at the story, but didn't he throw away the hard drive in February last year?
Wasn't bitcoin something like $50 back then? So he basically threw away over $300,000 worth of bitcoin. Seriously, if the story is real, the guy is a moron.

It's not about winning or losing. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:42:44
Not intentional implies he accidentally threw the wrong hard drive away or something. He was just an idiot, having forgotten he had more than 300 grand sitting on it. 
One thing would be throwing it away when the coins had no value, but he really doesn't have an excuse. Especially considering the fact that he worked in IT.

Newsflash: a psychopath and a sociopath are the same thing.
Maybe you should re-consider your self-proclaimed diagnosis.

They're not *evil*. They're just a company with a controversial business model. They've never harmed anyone.

Also, I feel like the implication of OP's post is that it's not fair that the BTC people were arrested when the bankers weren't. In reality, both are criminals, and both should face the consequences of their actions.
I may have misunderstood this post, but it almost seems to be defending Shrem.

Alternatively: Try going to the Wiki page for "Sociopathy" and see where that redirects you.

Plenty of people aren't into bitcoin for the anonymity.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:51:24
EPIC FOR THE WIN
@_date: 2013-05-11 11:44:11
With all our early-adopted bitcoins, this would be one of the easiest steps. 
@_date: 2013-08-16 23:19:19
It already is worth a fraction of that.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:22:30
Just to make sure, I'm also going to try betting 32 BTC. Can't be sure until I've tried it!

So it is impossible to sell anything at a profit?
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:53:32
The market is much too small and volatile right now... 
If the market becomes very big, the prices will be insanely high for one bc.

I like your dedication, but if I saw this poster without knowing about Bitcoin, I'd probably assume it was a scam. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 17:17:08
If bitcoin is not recognized as a legal currency, does it technically count as reselling?
@_date: 2013-08-28 17:42:24
I'd definitely pick Michael Scofield.
