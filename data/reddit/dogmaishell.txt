Don’t forget your taxes! If you got paid with BTC in December you would be soooooo screwed

No. You are. Checkmate. You have no answer to this

You can see the US net wealth [$125 Trillion]( and divide it by your family members. Spoiler: You are not getting a check for $300k.

You keep saying hyperinflation and I don’t think you mean that. That is people with wheelbarrows full of money buying milk. We are not at risk for that anymore than we are at risk for an asteroid or comet.
The currency is secondary to the economy.
You seem to have it the other way around in your head.
If the USD collapses, it will be a result of Armageddon. Not the other way around.
(That does not mean currency policy cannot impact the economy, but you keep mentioning hyperinflation which can only be the result of economic collapse in the West)
A word about national debt. The US owes the debt mostly to its own citizens in the form of T-Bills. Yes, your grandmother is milking the US for that sweet TBill money.
Yes, it is reckless for the governments to borrow and spend like drunken sailors. There is a difference. The US can print more money and back it up. 
And the US economy will continue to grow.

In what country? People who live in countries that experience hyperinflation even close to the paranoid dangers described here are being sold a bill of goods with BTC.

About 45% of public debt (35% of total debt) is owned by foreign entities. The rest of the public debt is owed to US entities. The rest of the total debt is the government borrowing from one part to another. Again, you cannot divide it by people. That makes no sense. 
That’s like dividing the value of all the federal owned real estate by the number of people and saying everyone in your family is rich.
I get it that you are concerned about debt. It can be a problem, but it is not the only problem.
The USD cannot collapse unless the United States collapses as a country. That is what you are missing. We will all be speaking Canadian by then and it won’t matter, eh?

I’m sorry. The way you worded your post it seemed to me (and others) that you knew you were purchasing stolen cards.

Do you really not understand that you committed a crime and admitted to it here?

The reason is that hyperinflation is a symptom of economic collapse, not the cause. It does not make sense to worry about hyperinflation. Worry about the fundamentals of the economy.
Now, if you want to worry about “high inflation” then look to the 1970’s in America. Go read about it and tell me what Bitcoin would have done for gas prices.
That being said, the USD and Euro are special. It is not magic. They are supported by the two largest most stable democratic economies on the planet. The Yen is supported by an economic Superpower as well.
If the USD collapses, you will not be worrying about the value of your savings account.
It is ridiculous to talk about stability of USD in the same breath as Bitcoin.

You said “hyperinflation.” That is a genuine problem that simply does not exist in the West since World War times. (Picture 1 Trillion dollar notes to buy bread. 2 Trillion tomorrow.)
Hyperinflation is a symptom of economic collapse, not the cause of your saving eroding.
The US does have modest inflation. You can google the differences between a stable inflationary currency and a stable deflationary currency if you wish. BTW, there is also stagflation which is very detrimental.
Low inflation does not erode your money unless it is in a mattress or savings account for a long time. Simple index funds will protect you from that.
What you appear to be most concerned about is the National Debt. (Of course, how this is addressed by Bitcoin is not clear)
This is, indeed, a problem. It is not exactly what you say.
It does not make sense to divide the national debt by the number of citizens. National debt is not like personal debt. It is secured by the stability of the US. 
It is not going to “come due” with people coming to your house to collect funds.
