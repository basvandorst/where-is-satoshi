Well, for example, [a 2013 study]( by Sergio Lerner suggests Satoshi likely mined between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 BTC. This is valued at over a *billion* dollars. Ego is a distraction. Ever heard of the saying money talks, BS walks? Who but Satoshi Nakamoto has seen more direct personal benefit from Bitcoin?


I wouldn't describe the open source community as being any different from other political organizations. Sometimes a single strong founder is better at carrying a vision forward than a team of people who are subject to numerous pitfalls of organizational behavior.

Equally, doesn't that describe Satoshi Nakamoto, when he founded the Bitcoin project?

Sure, and I'm not saying don't do a drivechain. Do a drivechain. Have at it.
But to do a drivechain *to the exclusion of scaling mainnet*? THAT is what is suggesting, and it is a reckless and dangerous suggestion akin to playing roulette and betting it all on red.
This is because a competitor could come along with the very same enticing features of a drivechain only integrated into a mainnet system. That mainnet system would deliver more value than the sidechain through its superior security and permanence properties.

Huh? For miners to steal user funds out from cold storage like that, they'd have to pull a **DAO level event** on top of Bitcoin with zero reprisal. Do you SERIOUSLY suggest 51% of the miners would be able to modify their mining nodes to reassign cold storage funds to themselves, and get away with it?
Further, do you *dare* suggest this isn't possible today?
I find it incredibly unlikely Satoshi Nakamoto would've considered this to be a threat to scaling Bitcoin. He always said Bitcoin should scale with full nodes run by specialists in datacenters, and here you are saying Satoshi did not account for this DAO level event possibility.
Regardless, no one in the technical community objected to this DAO level event possibility up until *you did*, just now.


Running a full node does NOT grant you any sovereignty or consensus protections in the Bitcoin system.

While it's true that in an ICO, you sacrifice a scarce resource to receive another scarce resource in return, this analysis is *woefully* incomplete.
Importantly, in an ICO, the initial scarce resource (e.g. BTC) is **given** to another entity. Hence, the scarce resource is NOT lost.
Conversely, no one *receives* the electricity burned to mint bitcoins. The electricity is lost, period.
This is the key distinction between Bitcoin and an ICO.
I recommend all would-be ICO promoters thoroughly investigate Proof of Burn schemes, e.g. [Counterparty](


In a Proof of Burn, one scarce resource is destroyed, and a newly created scarce resource is received in return. THAT is the corollary you are looking for.
When ICOs have their day in court, hopefully the pertinent question will be asked: *why an ICO and not a Proof of Burn*?

Interesting counterargument, so Ethereum's an unregistered security? Guess what they're going to argue in court!
And there I was thinking Bitcoin and Ethereum had a bitter rivalry *already*. Nope! As if to add insult to injury, ICO promoters are going to try to throw Bitcoin under the bus to save their own asses.
Suffice to say, your argument is shall we say *reaching*: in 2009, mining difficulty was nil. As you're well aware, the earliest miners could mint BTC easily on consumer laptops with zero modifications. To the extent any power was required to mine, the power *costs* were sunk, immaterial and certainly not on the order of what is commonly raised in most of today's gray market ICOs such as Ethereum.
And that's another key distinction: in an ICO, the money raised goes directly to the issuer of the shares, exactly as in a traditional IPO. The resemblance is *uncanny*.


... was not an ICO. It was a *proof of burn*, which is substantially similar to the way Bitcoin itself was launched.
I leave you with this bit by securities lawyer Jason Seibert (of SEC v PirateAt40 lore):

How can Bitcoin miners steal from your cold storage wallets in a 51% attack of mainnet?
And before you bring up some semantic BS like "a reorg from genesis block could be launched and wipe out the entire blockchain". The chances of that happening are NIL.
On a drivechain, miners can reach into your cold storage wallets and steal the funds in their entirety. Period. This is NOT possible with a 51% attack of mainnet.

Hi On a drivechain, a 51% attack can result in *total loss of funds* for everyone using the drivechain. A drivechain is strictly inferior to a mainnet system for this reason.
Workarounds like introducing trusted third parties to manage multisig accounts is a further step back from mainnet's security properties.
The bottom line is a mainnet system has permanence and security properties that sidechains will simply never have. If you think there is good reason to scale, then you should err on the side of scaling via mainnet throughput increases, *not* scaling via sidechains. The sidechains will just not be able to hold their own against competitors who make the sacrifices necessary to deliver features on mainnet.
