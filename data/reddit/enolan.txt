What is this site for?
What problem does this solve?
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:54:06
It's **always** been associated with fringe kookiness. Have you been to this subreddit?
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:05:25
Who are these people and what are they doing?
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:06:13
This guy is completely wrong. Don't worry about it.

Please spend your time and resources on things with actual security implications. Anyone can buy an SSL certificate. I can set up blockchainaosiao.onion with my own cert tomorrow.

That's not what insolvent means, kiddo.

Virtual implies fake. The idea is convey that BTC is as real as dollars.

You can get XP from mining now?
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:39:43
No one will mine if the mined coins are valueless. Getting paid on the fork nobody cares about is getting paid in Schrutebucks.

No. The purpose of CAs is to verify that the server you're talking to is operated by the organization that actually owns the domain you're trying to connect to. DigiCert doesn't have to do anything at all to ensure blockchainbdgpzk.onion corresponds to blockchain.info.

Did you read it? "If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in this Agreement [...] must cancel your Coinbase account free of charge [...]".
It was highlighted.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:54:55
Don't be absurd. Coinbase is not going to steal all your money. Cancelling means you get your stuff back.

Now it's for buying drugs AND paying ransoms!

It gets the memers goin'!

Switching to Bitcoin doesn't solve the ethical problems, it only removes the possibility of chargebacks. The Bitcoin economy has far more thieves per capita than the Visa one.

Expand this to Dota 2 and I will start using it immediately.

Here's what the blockchain.info page you linked means: the address 15jEkK... received 23.62 bitcoins from four different addresses on August 2 at 2:52 AM UTC. If you told MtGox to send 23.62 to that address at around that time, then that transaction went through fine.
@_date: 2011-08-18 07:01:56
Why would you post this here? Nothing in the bitcoin protocol is encrypted, let alone with AES.
@_date: 2011-12-20 06:23:11
All publicity is good publicity. It's not like anyone savvy expects a tv show to get anything about technology right.
@_date: 2011-07-28 23:59:13
This is disingenuous and lame.
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:22:07
DRM is by definition technology to stop the user doing what they want with the data. The "good parts" of Steam - update system, store, community, etc - aren't DRM.

Please don't daytrade your entire life savings. Please. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 02:51:48
They said 0.1% of the **merchants**. Not transfers, not dollars transferred. It stands to reason a large fraction of their traffic in the past was Bitcoin related.
@_date: 2013-10-13 06:07:31
Dropbox is proprietary as well. And I don't know what you mean by trusted either seeing as Dropbox can look through all your files just like Google can look through all your Gmail.

Didn't we have a similar thread like last week and it was determined that the numbers were probably BS? Can any Chinese bitcoiners chime in?
