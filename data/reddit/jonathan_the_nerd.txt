Only a small number of people have commit access.  Those people are opposed to increasing the block size via hard fork, despite some of them having favored it prior to 2013.  All attempts to increase the block size except for the Core-approved Segwit have failed.  All attempts at compromise have failed.  With the death of Segwit2x, the core developers have regained total control over the Bitcoin software.  The only way to make an unapproved change is to fork the software and create a new project.

So miners have the power to bring Bitcoin to its knees?  I thought Bitcoin was anti-fragile.
Tell me, how do you know miners are "spamming" the mempool?  How do you distinguish "junk" transactions from real ones?


I don't know about LTC, but it would be a lot harder to jam up BCH.  The block size is 8MB compared to Bitcoin's ~1MB.  And BCH's block size is going to be increased to 32MB in the next scheduled hard fork upgrade.  BCH will eat a spam attack and ask for more.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:29:09
Those useful features don't require Segwit.  They just require a fix for transaction malleability.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:54:55
BCH can use second-layer solutions just like BTC can.  They ~~merged~~ **are working on** their own fix for transaction malleability, so they can do Lightning without Segwit.  But until Lightning is ready, BCH can handle lots of transactions with low fees, while BTC struggles under the load.

I don't have any gif or jpg skills, so I'll have to use words.
A long time ago (two or three years), the Bitcoin network started getting backlogged.  There were disagreements on how to scale.  Some people said, "Let's just increase the blocksize."  Others said, "Think of the disk and network requirements!  Let's do Segwit and Lightning so we don't have to raise the blocksize."  People started arguing.  The Bitcoin community split into two camps with increasingly hostile rhetoric.  There were many arguments for and against Segwit; some technical, some emotional, some weird.  After a lot of arguing, Segwit was activated.  After it was locked in but before it was activated, the large-blockers said, "FINE!  We'll create our own coin!  With big blocks, and low fees, and no Segwit!"  And that's what they did.
I'm leaving out a *lot*, because I don't feel like writing ten pages of history.  But now we have two coins.  Bitcoin has Segwit and low capacity and occasional backlogs and high fees.  Bitcoin Cash has large blocks, with the accompanying low fees and fast confirmations.  And now that everyone has gotten their own way... we're *still* yelling at each other.
You should ask the same question over on You'll get very different answers.  And unlike this sub, isn't censo

Common misconception.  Bitcoin's stated scaling solution is Lightning.  But operating a Lightning node is capital-intensive.  People who can afford to lock up more money can process more transactions.  Opening and closing channels is expensive.  As Bitcoin adoption increases, fees will only get higher.  Fewer and fewer people will have the resources to operate a Lightning node.  Lightning will become centralized into the hands of a few big players.
Bitcoin Cash doesn't force people onto Lightning.  And since fees are low, anyone can use it.  The lack of gatekeepers is worth the slight decrease in full nodes brought on by a bigger blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:35:14
I personally refer to the two coins as "Bitcoin Catholic" and "Bitcoin Protestant".  The original Bitcoin is Satoshi's codebase, maintained by others after Satoshi disappeared.  Bitcoin Cash supporters believe Core deviated from Satoshi's vision along the way.  They tried to reform Bitcoin, but when that failed they created their own coin to better follow Satoshi's teachings.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:48:46
So what are people supposed to do in the meantime?  Use altcoins?  If most of the users leave, how do you know they'll return once Lightning is ready?
It took eight years for Bitcoin to reach $2000.  Bitcoin Cash did it in four months.  How much higher will it go before Lightning is finally ready?

Hang on, I think one of us is missing something.  If the private key matches the public key, then won't OP_CHECKSIG return true regardless?  Any keypair can be used to make a digital signature.  (That's true for asymmetric encryption in general, not just Bitcoin.)  The only additional requirement imposed by Bitcoin is that the public key must hash to the given 160-bit value.  So if someone manages to produce a colliding keypair, they will still be able to produce a valid signature, and thus spend the coins.  The network has no way of knowing which public key is the intended one.  Have I missed something?

You can do nLockTime transactions, although it's extremely difficult. Right now, the network will reject transactions with nLockTime in the future, but it will accept and relay transactions once they're spendable.
Creating nLockTime transactions ~~isn't~~ is very complicated.
1. Use createrawtransaction in bitcoind to create your transaction, but don't sign it yet.
2. Take the time you want and convert it to a Unix timestamp. For example, March 15, 2014 11:15 AM EDT is 1394896500.
3. Convert the timestamp to hex. 1394896500 works out to 53246e74.
4. Reverse the bytes to make the number little-endian. That gets us 746e2453.  **Edit:** Note: you're not just reversing the digits.  You're reversing the bytes.  Each byte is two hex digits.  If the original number was 12345678, the byte-reversed number would be 78563412.
5. Take the raw transaction you created in step 1. The last 8 digits are 00000000. Replace those digits with the result from step 4.
6. nLockTime is ignored if the sequence number is hex ffffffff, which is the default. Somewhere in the raw transaction, there will be a sequence of 8 f's. (There should be a sequence of 8 zeroes in front of it.) Change one of them to something less than f. Either a letter from a to e or a digit.
7. Use signrawtransaction in bitcoind to sign the edited transaction. If you've done everything right, the transaction should be signed correctly.
8. Broadcast the transaction using sendrawtransaction, or submit it at  The network will reject the transaction until after nLockTime has passed.
Good luck, and may Satoshi have mercy on your soul.
Edit: I should write this up as a real post.  I've spent a lot of time analyzing the structure of raw transactions, so I know what standard transactions look like.

Maybe you'll "forget" to publish a few bounties and claim a system error ate them.  Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless.

(Almost) every transaction has change outputs. When you create a transaction that combines multiple outputs, it's almost certain that those addresses all belong to the same person. An observer can then trace those transactions backwards and figure out what other addresses you probably control. Coinjoin and stealth address make it harder to trace, but you probably won't mix every transaction you make.

As far as I can tell, it's a replacement for altcoins. Unlike altcoins, sidechains can be merge mined, which means mining them doesn't take hash power away from Bitcoin. They can trivially be converted to/from bitcoins through double pegging, which means you don't need an exchange to buy or sell them (I think). They don't promote inflation, because you have to freeze bitcoins to create sidechain coins. (As a side effect, this slightly increases the value of everyone else's bitcoins by decreasing the supply.) They taste like cheese.

You're slightly incorrect. If you needed the private key that corresponded to a given public key, you would need to work out all 256 bits. But Bitcoin doesn't work like that. To spend coins, you only need to find a keypair for which the public key hashes to the given 160-bit hash. For every Bitcoin address, there are (2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96) private keys that will match the address. You only need one of them. It's still insanely difficult, but not 2^256 difficult.

Even using a different address for every transaction, you still have combined change inputs to deal with.
Suppose you have two bitcoins.  You got them from different transactions, so they're in different addresses.  You have one coin in address A and one in address B.  Now suppose you make the following transactions:
1. You send 0.6 coins to address X.  You use the coin in address A.  0.6 coins go to address X, and the other 0.4 go to change address C.
2. You send 0.7 coins to address Y.  You use the coin in address B.  0.7 coins go to address Y, and the other 0.3 go to change address D.
3. You send 0.6 coins to address Z.  Neither of your change outputs is big enough to satisfy the transaction by itself, so both get used.  0.4 coins from address C are combined with 0.3 coins from address D.  0.6 coins go to address Z, and the other 0.1 coins go to change address E.
The third transaction uses the coins from addresses C and D.  An observer knows with almost 100% certainty that addresses C and D are owned by the same person.  They can extrapolate backwards and guess that you own either A or X and either B or Y.  They can extrapolate forwards and guess that you own either Z or E.  If they find out from another source that you don't own address Z, then that means the coins in E are yours, and the next transaction from E is yours.
The science of data mining is extremely powerful.  An observer can get a lot more information than what I've described by observing the pattern of transactions in the blockchain.  Even if you use a mixer, the people you transact with might not be as careful, and they'll leak information.

Someday if/when the blockchain size becomes a problem, old transaction outputs can be removed without causing problems.  Some nodes will undoubtedly continue to store the entire blockchain forever, but other nodes can choose to prune outputs in order to save on disk space.
Unspent transactions outputs can never be pruned, though, because they might be spent someday.  Unspendable outputs will hang around forever, uselessly taking up memory and disk space.  OP_RETURN provides a way for a transaction to indicate that an output will never be spent, so that output can be pruned.  People will store data in the blockchain anyway, so OP_RETURN gives them a way to do so that has the least impact on the network.
Edit: the "without causing problems" part may not be entirely correct.

No, it wasn't an attack. It's more like a divorce. Segwit supporters and big block supporters simply couldn't agree on how to move forward. So the big-blockers went and made their own chain. Only time will tell which chain will succeed. Maybe both will, and there will be two Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:34:00
Or maybe they believe BCH will be more profitable in the long run? BCH's huge blocks will accommodate more transactions, which will lead to more fees. Bitcoin blocks won't get much bigger, and miners don't get fees from Lightning transactions.

I don't think your nLockTime method will work. Back when I was learning about Bitcoin, I created and sent nLockTime transactions on both Testnet and the main network.

That's exactly what it was. Segwit by itself never got more than ~30% miner support. It was the 2x part that got Segwit activated. Nobody really wanted Segwit2x, but it was the only way that both sides could agree on to break the stalemate.
There were small groups on both sides that favored hard forking to get their preferred solution. BIP148 was the Segwit-side proposal. A non-Segwit hard fork was the other side. BIP148 didn't activate because Segwit was locked in before its deadline. The big-block fork became Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:19:10


I meant miners don't get fees from transactions taking place in an established channel. They do get fees when a channel opens or closes. If most Bitcoin activity takes place off-chain, that's a lot of lost revenue. All Bitcoin Cash transactions are on-chain, and almost all of them will include miner fees.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:01:19
BIP148 was also a consensus-breaking hard fork.  Segwit2x was a less radical way of achieving consensus between miners and users.

In my opinion, the economy will follow the miners. No one will use a coin that takes almost an hour to produce a block. Plus, the New York agreement (segwit2x) had broad community support. I think Segwit2x will become Bitcoin.

In April of 2013, Bitcoin climbed to the then-dizzying height of $243, then crashed to $60.  It took a long time to climb back over $200.

@_date: 2017-08-19 01:44:38
Okay, I concede that I got the conditions mixed up.
With a soft fork, blocks or transactions that would be accepted by the old version are rejected by the new.  For example, Segwit transactions with invalid witness data would be accepted by old nodes but rejected by Segwit nodes.  That way, upgraded nodes can start putting out upgraded data, and older nodes will relay it without necessarily understanding it.
With a hard fork, blocks or transactions that would be *rejected* by the old version are *accepted* by the new.  For example, an increase in MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.  We saw that when Bitcoin Unlimited miners accidentally put out a block a few bytes bigger than 1MB.  An overwhelming majority of the network rejected it, and BU had to issue a patch so miners wouldn't continue to build on the invalid block.
BIP148 is somewhat unique in that it fulfills *both* conditions.
As I said earlier, blocks generated by older nodes would be rejected by BIP148 nodes.  That by itself wouldn't be a hard fork.  It would be a soft fork.  The blockchain would continue to flow along.
BIP148 miners would build new blocks only on top of blocks that signaled Segwit.  The chains would split when a BIP148-compliant miner ignored the latest non-Segwit-signalling block and mined a block on top of the previous Segwit-signalling block.  That new block would be accepted by other BIP148 nodes, but rejected by the rest of the network.  The new software generates blocks that the old software considers invalid.  That's a hard fork.  Segwit is a soft fork, but BIP148 would have been a hard fork.

I don't really care, but the miners do.  I think most of them dislike the idea of the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions being out of their reach.


I'm not going to argue your numbers.  But miners are self-interested.  They'll do whatever they think will make them the most money.  I believe they'll make more money mining lots of low-fee transactions than mining a smaller number of high-fee transactions.  I might be wrong.


I'd like for users to have a choice.  If Bitcoin blocks aren't allowed to grow, then most people won't be able to afford to transact on-chain, and they'll be forced to use Lightning.  I think fees ought to remain low enough that people can make all of their transactions on-chain if they want.  For those who prefer Lightning, it will be available for BCH eventually.  But it will be optional.

Segwit doesn't get rid of the 1MB MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.  It just reinterprets it.  It's sort of an accounting trick.  Segwit blocks are about 1.7 MB on average.  But all the witness data (signatures) are stored *outside* the traditional block.  MAX_BLOCK_SIZE only applies to the non-witness data (the transactions themselves).  Old nodes won't even see the signatures.  They'll only see 1MB blocks full of unsigned transactions.

One of the side effects of implementing Segwit as a soft fork is that the non-witness portion of the block can't exceed 1MB.  That's what I was referring to.  If I simply say "block size", it's likely that someone will pop up and say "lol segwit is a blocksize increase".  And that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about the part of the block that's still limited to 1MB.  So I usually refer to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE instead.  I didn't know it had been removed from the code.  I learned something today.

Use less data in the transaction hash. Right now, the signature is itself included in the hash. So if the sender generates a new signature, the transaction hash will change. Ideally, the hash should not include the digital signature(s). The hash should only cover the transaction inputs and outputs. If a different transaction is created with exactly the same inputs and outputs, it should always have the same hash as the original. That's one thing Segwit does: it changes the transaction format so that signatures aren't included in transaction hashes.
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:22:17

@_date: 2016-02-29 01:17:33
There's a chance the transaction will be dropped from the network altogether if it doesn't get confirmed.  I'm not sure how long that takes.  Here's something you can do to guard against it.  Save the raw transaction.    If it doesn't confirm within a day or two, rebroadcast it.    That doesn't guarantee that it will confirm, but at least you won't completely lose the coins.
Here's hoping that you won't need it.

Then we have a chain split. The majority of nodes will follow the longer chain containing both Segwit-signaling and non-Segwit-signaling blocks. The minority will follow their own chain of Segwit-signaling-only blocks. The split will continue until one side gives up.

3000 trillion is roughly 2^51. There are 2^160 possible Bitcoin addresses. (Yes, private keys are 256 bits, but addresses are only 160 bits. You only need to get the address right to steal coins.) That means they've searched 1/(2^109) of the possible address space. For perspective, the universe is roughly 2^58 seconds old.

A blockchain fork isn't the same thing as an open-source software fork.  With a software fork, one person or group copies the software and makes their own project.  Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin in that sense.  The Litecoin devs decided they could improve on Bitcoin, so they went and made their own currency, with a completely separate blockchain.
A blockchain fork like what's happening now is very different.  In this case, you have two groups wrestling for control of the same blockchain.  Once the fork is activated, both groups will still be mining on the same blockchain.  But once the first &gt;1MB block is mined, different nodes will disagree on whether that block is valid, and miners will start mining on separate forks.  Coins generated on one chain won't be valid on the other one.  But all coins that existed before the fork will still be valid on both chains.  Unless one side capitulates quickly, there could be utter chaos.

Yes, I do. But you're forgetting that it's expensive to operate a data center. Electricity is the biggest cost. The price of electricity isn't going to halve when the block reward does. If the new block reward isn't enough to pay for electricity and other costs, the miner will have to shut down or substantially alter his operation.

 &gt; In any case it doesn't sound like a good idea to go for a hard fork when there are so many against it.
Whether the the hard fork occurs will be decided by the miners. The miners have a vested interest in maximizing fees per block without pushing users away with excessive fees. The miners know the pros and cons of a hard fork, and they're going to think carefully before they risk their profits. And I think they're going to vote to fork.


The problem here is time. The network is already getting congested. More and more blocks are above 900 kb. Transactions randomly take hours to confirm. I agree that SegWit is a good idea, but it won't come soon enough. A 2MB hard fork will buy enough time for the devs to get SegWit thoroughly tested and proven. Then we can build payment channels and Lightning without time pressure.
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:41:06
The blocks are filling up.  Backlogs are becoming more common.  Sometimes transactions will take hours to confirm.

Lightning doesn't need Segwit. It only needs a fix for transaction malleability. There are multiple ways to fix malleability. Segwit is only one of them.
Larger blocks require more storage and more bandwidth. But in case you haven't noticed, storage and bandwidth are both getting cheaper. When I was in high school, I was in awe that my new computer had a whole gigabyte of storage. Now multi-terabyte hard drives are common.

I'll grant that our hypothetical $2/day friend couldn't afford to run a node. But he wouldn't have to. Have you heard of this newfangled "SPV" thing?

If your inputs don't add up to exactly the right amount, won't you end up overpaying or underpaying?  Or do you manipulate the transaction fee to get your outputs where you need them?  I'm not arguing, I honestly want to understand.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:37:43
If the hash is valid, does it really matter how they arrived at the answer? The Bitcoin protocol requires that miners produce a valid hash beginning with a certain number of zero bits. ASICBoost miners do that. Can you show me the section in the whitepaper that forbids miners producing valid hashes through unusual methods?

I believe you're underestimating the importance of the miners. If the miners really want Segwit2x to succeed, I think they can do it. If they believe Segwit2x is in their long-term interest, they'll be willing to take short-term losses to ensure the death of the old chain.

You mean child-pays-for-parent?  It only works if you're receiving the transaction.  You send the unconfirmed output to yourself with a high fee.  A miner will see that the high-fee transaction depends on the low-fee transaction and mine both of them.
If you're sending coins to someone else, you can't do that, because you can't spend the output.

Would you like an explanation? Too bad, you're getting one anyway.
Bitcoin Core's block size is now fixed at ~1.7 MB on average (max 4 MB). As usage grows, more and more transactions will move off-chain onto Lightning. More users will require more payment channels. Every channel requires one on-chain transaction to open and another one to close. That means more and more transactions will be packed into those 1.7 MB blocks. Fees will rise. Over time, fees will rise to the point where only rich people will be able to establish channels. People who can't afford the fees will have to sign up with a Lightning provider. Large organizations will be most able to afford the on-chain fees and put up the money to fund Lightning channels. Smaller operators will be pushed out. Bitcoin will be controlled by huge corporations.
Bitcoin Cash is different. Blocks can grow with usage, ensuring reasonable on-chain fees even under heavy load. Lightning will eventually come to Bitcoin Cash, but it will be *optional*. Anyone who wants to will still be able to transact on-chain. No gatekeepers.

Segwit won't immediately solve the problem. Segwit transactions can only be sent from Segwit addresses. Coins stored in non-Segwit addresses can only be spent by non-Segwit-formatted transactions.

Two-factor authentication means that you need more than a password to get into your account.  You need something you *know* (password), and something you *have* (smartphone or other device).  That way, even if someone guesses your password, they won't be able to get into your account unless they also steal your phone.
Coinbase has instructions on how to enable two-factor authentication.  I recommend that you not use SMS.  A scammer can call your mobile provider and possibly trick them into transferring your phone number to their phone.  Use Google Authenticator or Authy.  But if you don't have a smartphone, using SMS for two-factor authentication is better than not using two-factor authentication at all.

Common sense says that you're not responsible for what someone does with the bitcoins after you've finished the transaction.  But the law isn't necessarily based on common sense.  I'm not a lawyer, but I would recommend not doing business with anyone who seems shifty.  You can't possibly know the intentions of all of your customers, of course, but if you cut off relations with the most suspicious ones, you might reduce your risk.  No guarantees, of course.

It's mostly because of banking regulations. Banks and other financial institutions are required by law to collect information on their customers\*. They also have to comply with anti money laundering regulations.
The other reason is that most forms of online payment are reversible, but Bitcoin payments are irreversible. A scammer can buy coins with PayPal or a credit card, receive the coins, and later dispute the transaction. Bitcoin sellers have to take steps to protect themselves from that kind of fraud.
Your age is also a factor. In the US, minors can't be bound by contracts. That makes it difficult for minors to do business. There may be similar restrictions in your country.

You're doing it right.
If you never put the private key on an Internet-connected computer, you should be fine. There are only two downsides to reusing an address like that.
1. It makes it easier for someone to track your activity on the blockchain. I'm guessing you already knew that.
2. If quantum computers ever become practical, then an attacker can use [Shor's Algorithm]( to recover any private key that's ever signed a transaction. That would make address reuse impossible. But you probably don't have to worry about that for a while yet.

In my opinion, the price is still too volatile for Bitcoin to be used as a store of value. If I had bought 10 BTC at $1200 each, then I would have lost $6,000 in a matter of days. If I needed that money quickly, I would be in a world of hurt. I own bitcoins because I believe in the technology, but I would be stupid to store a significant chunk of my net worth in bitcoins right now.
In the future, though, when Bitcoin's value stabilizes (or the value of USD destabilizes), it will be an excellent store of value.

It's still not correct. Bitcoins are produced at a constant rate regardless off the number of miners. Miners will enter or leave based on their costs and expected values, but they won't change the rate of production. So the cost of mining will have no effect on Bitcoin's price.

How does the system detect double spends?  If I have an address with 2 BTC in it, I can send 1BTC to one address and 1BTC to another address, and that's a valid transaction.  But if I only have 1BTC to start out with, then that would be a double-spend.  But how would the network know the difference between those two situations?

The problem isn't a lack of regulation; the problem is that no one knows what the government might do in the future.  We know the government will do something with Bitcoin, but we don't know what that will be.  Until some part of the government acts, everyone's holding their breath.

Take a look at   It's extremely quick and easy.  You don't have to create an account beforehand; just deposit cash, receive bitcoins.  I've bought from them twice and had a good experience both times.  The only downside is that there's a $5 minimum fee on orders over $5, and that works out to a hefty percentage if you're buying more than $5 and less than $100.  They're geared more towards big orders than small ones.

Math question: when you say "average stake", do you really mean median?  As in, 50% of the bets are below the median, and 50% above?  Because if you mean "arithmetic mean", which is the usual interpretation of "average", then you might have a situation where 90% of your bettors are below the mean.
Another math question: What happens if one person contributes more than 50% of the stake?  Suppose you have 10 players that each bet 0.1 BTC.  Then there's Insanity Wolf, who bets 100 BTC.  Insanity Wolf clearly wins the "biggest stake" prize, but the entire stake is only 101 BTC, which would mean Insanity Wolf "wins" only 50.5 BTC.  How would you deal with that situation?

Question: how would a huge buy wall affect the price?  I know it will prevent the price from dropping below the wall until it's fulfilled, but could it push the price up by decreasing supply?

If they outlaw the buying and selling of bitcoins, that would shut down all the exchanges in the U.S. and prevent American businesses from accepting bitcoins.

One more thing to keep in mind: it's not possible to withdraw some of the coins from the paper wallet and leave the rest there. If you want to use any amount from the paper wallet, you'll have to import the entire amount onto your computer. Afterwards, you can make a new paper wallet.

Sounds like you're looking for [Peercoin]( It's designed to inflate at 1% per year. Instead of Bitcoin-style proof of work, it uses proof of stake, for which the only energy requirement is leaving your computer on. Currently, it users a combined proof of work and proof of stake system, where some coins are mined like Bitcoin and others are generated through proof of stake. But proof of work mining will eventually end, while proof of stake will deliver new coins forever. The only problem is that the confirmation time is the same as Bitcoin, so it doesn't fulfill your desire for short confirmation times. Take a look anyway.

Instead of fractional reserve banking, we could accomplish the same thing honestly with Certificates of Deposit.  You make a loan to the bank for for 6 months (or however long the CD is), and in exchange the bank pays you back with interest when the CD matures.  The bank is upfront about the fact that they loan out the money you give them, and your money may not be available if you want it back early.  That way, the bank can make loans and still be honest about the contents of their vaults.

This will take a little bit of explaining.
Imagine this. You go to the store to buy something that costs $4.25, but you only have a $20 bill. You hand the cashier a $20 bill. The cashier tears it in two pieces, creating a $4.25 bill and a $15.74 bill. (The other cent goes to the miners.) The cashier hands you back the $15.74 bill. The original $20 bill is gone. That's how Bitcoin transactions work.
Almost all Bitcoin wallet programs will send change to a new address. This serves to increase your privacy and make it harder to track your transactions. When you use the funds from a paper wallet, the change goes to a different address created by the software. The address on the paper wallet is empty now, and you shouldn't reuse it.
All Bitcoin wallet software handles change addresses transparently behind the scenes, so you don't normally have to worry about it. But paper wallets don't handle themselves, so you have to pay a little more attention.
