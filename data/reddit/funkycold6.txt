@_date: 2019-07-22 14:06:40
Had that happen to me. I wasnt home to sign for it so they sent it to my post office.
EDIT-Went to post office and they sent it back. I called ledger support. They couldnt find it and it got lost in the mail. They refunded my money. Got another one a few weeks later. Ledger support was awesome during this time frame.

After the next halvening and when the price shoots up a few months after. You will be getting the calls from friends and family. I already have been sending my friends and family videos from youtube, articles. Links to coinbase and binance. Stuff to peak their interest. I even told them just throw 10 bucks into bitcoin every paycheck. Man they just laugh and laugh and change the subject. 
About late March i sent my dad another email with the same information i have been sending him for a year. 
At the end of the email i said " I know you are tired of me harping you about crypto and this once in a life time opportunity. I am sending you this information one last time and i will stop bothering you about it. Now i can say i wont feel bad when you and the rest of the family are asking for satoshis when you dont have any."
So that was then end of the email. To be honest in 2-5 years you will either have bitcoin or you wont. It will be the halves and the have nots. You think the wealth gap is big now. It will be even worse in the near future. 
Love everyone in this space. Stay positive

@_date: 2019-09-26 18:03:38
Man what is crazy is that he sent me that text of when he would invest when i was heading home. I didnt hear from him since. When the price dropped and he told me he was in. Now we have been speaking 24/7 about crypto. He fell in the rabbit hole. He has been DYOR
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:43:54
Back in July i was on vacation I was speaking to my step bro about Crypto. He said that some of his buddies have been trying to get him into it but told him to wait till it drops to 8200 later this year. When it dropped yesterday my step bro texted me and said he is now an investor in this space.

@_date: 2019-05-19 02:42:22

@_date: 2019-05-07 18:18:04
Man i totally agree with you. There is a video made just yesterday regarding bitcoin/crypto etc form the modern investor on youtube. I forwarded that video to my family and friends. I am that "CRAZY" person that tells them to put like 20 bucks a paycheck in. They just listen and node their head and i know they are just waiting for me to shut up. I talk to my wife about it also becuase she too has the same idea as me. Anyway i sent them the video link in the email and i wrote.
" Hey guys just watch this video its 15 minutes long. It will open your eyes regarding bitcoin and the future and what putting some money in will/might do in the future. I just dont want you to be thinking im an asshole or selfish when you come knocking on my door begging for satoshis.
EDIT-"You dont get it now but you will get it when BITCOIN is 250k!" The Modern Investor
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:01:10
I feel the same. I came in to the Crypto market during the ATH and i fell in the rabbit hole and have spent about a good 2-5 hours a day reading about crypto and projects etc. I can see the future for crypto in every day life. My wife understands or grasps how big this is so it feels great having the support. 
Everytime i put a video up just for people to listen to regarding crypto etc i get called a shill or whatever. Some people get it which is amazing and i know that this will take off. Bitcoin or any other coin project etc. I just tell my family and friends to do some research and sometimes i send them the videos via email or text and tell them to listen to on the way to work. Man i know i am not gonna feel bad at all for telling people I told you so or no becasue i gave them every chance in the world. They just blow me off

I told my ex wife here and then when i saw her when we were at our kids sports games.
She is fucking horrible with money like 50k in debt. Mkst of that credit cards and not to include her student loans. Knowing of her sitiation i kept telling her to put some in here and there. I eveb gave her a link to coinbase and sent her some youtube video how to do it. This was pre 2017.  
Now in the present she still doesnt give a fuck. So ill wait till we go back to coirt in like 3 or 5 years or so when its time for an update on our parenting plan and child support and wait for her to Try to squeeze more money out of me because BTC and crypto will be way more.
Fun fact bought my current wife a ledger for her birthday
 She was happy.

There was a video on youtube explaining this. Basically when TD ameritrade and Fidelity and all the other institutional investors get in that they will exhaust the OTC market and have to use the retail market. Since there is not much BTC left. Honestly you really think there is a lot of BTC on the OTC markets. There can only be so much. Soon in like 3-5 years you will either have bitcoin or you wont. Let me grab the link to his youtube channel. came out yesterday

"The Modern Investor" 
Such an amazing channel. Not really a podcast but his videos are roughly 20 minutes long. Great stuff. Listen to him everyday

Man thats a good idea for xmas. then i wont feel bad for when the crypto market blows up and they come running for satoshis
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:59:17
Sent this to family. Not the first time i sent something to family. After sending this video among many others trying to get them to just throw a couple bucks into the market I wont feel bad for saying I told you so.

Gonna lose a lot of cred. But he will gain it back in due time i reckon
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:33:57
Fack.. never thought about this. So i am guessing the same goes for if i was to sell them. Wow , eye opener right there
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:27:38
Man I dont think you are the only one who thinks like this. I am in the same boat. I have told many friends and family multiple times over. Even sent them videos and tutorials on how to purchase from an exchange. Most of the time you might get a dear in the headlights look. 
But i promise you this, they will only be interested in the weeks/months/ years to come when BTC/Crpyto jump in price. Then they will come to you and blame you for not telling them to get in.

they do up to 6 percent. I am aware of the free match , but as a personal goal i am taking the risk in getting some of my crypto positions to how i would like them. Then ill contribute again to the 6 percent match on the 401k then next january i will see where the market is again. 
It was a kind of big stress reliever when i got some of my holdings to where i want them in crypto. I am able to accumulate more by doing this. Diversify if you would say. I feel good about it.

No relatation to Mrs.

I dont think you can send them to another exchange or to your wallets. You buy BTC there and can only sell them and not transfer. Why i dont use them. But its a good ramp for beginners that are curious on this space
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:57:39
Yes i am. I have a certain amount i want to get in some specific coins. I have a good amount in my 401k. I stopped contributing into my 401k for this whole year or until i reach my goals on those amounts. Which ever comes first. Then ill see where i am and how much i want to continue to put in my 401k and Crypto. I also have an IRA that withdraws from my check monthly which i always forget about and i wont stop that. Just 401k.

Almost time to sweep 2018 under the rug
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:21:19
Ahhh okay.. I appreciate it. Im just tying to grasp how i would put in an order etc instead of jsut market buying. Looking at videos on youtube etc.
Just want to be able to set an order and forget about it. thanks for the heads up!!!
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:45:16

Then coinbase would be your best bet.
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:59:24
I totally feel you. My wife is from Germany and she tells me about those issues all the time. She speaks to her mom daily and visits about two months out of the year there. I guess it hit me harder when another person explains the exact things that are going on as my wife does. I tell her that is what is going to happen to America if we dont put our foot down.
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:48:40
I was thinking that way too about the IRA and 401ks. Stopped putting into 401k and started putting that into crypto. IF the economy falls so does the value inmy 401k. I see it as a gamble both ways. Just hope i choose right

Where are all the posts that my BTC got hacked from users????
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:10:54
Awesome read man, Love CoinTracker.. great article and tips. Have an upvote
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:04:44
Sooo if you lost BTC from this hack im sure someone would post. Unless this is Binance way to get rid of tether or to make it look like BTC lost ofreveer so they can keep when BTC blows up
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:28:39
Looks awesome, but where do i put in the quarter?
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:03:05
I think that this will drop once binance opens to trading again. PLus who knows with all that tether fiasco
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:54:37
I dont think they are counting people with multiple wallets cloud be wrong
