Its like no one reads....
Bcash was forked from BTC, you got an equivalent amount relative to your holdings of august 1st

There were like only 100 buy orders at that price it didnt matter.
Gdax was also fake holding the price at 9500 there was no demand for it just artificial manipulation.
There were 11k coins selling at 9500 and 100 coins being bought then they let the wall fall and if you look it feel to around 1k then they canceled all the orders

 if we start using ~~digital~~ money until we're dependent* on it for payment of everything, who will control the world then? The people with the most money will
Also coin mining is not infinite haha there are only going to be 21 million bitcoins the amount you can mine always goes down over time
