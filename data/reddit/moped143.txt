I am pretty new to this whole space. From the looks of it Decentralized is more secure.

I heard they do cash in cash out with no banks

With that attitude we will never solve the liquidity problem. Liquidity won't be there until you decide to bring it. With resources like **FREE** trading bots and market makers the solutions are there to take advantage of and add liquidity to decentralized exchanges. As a trader illiquid markets provide some of the best arbitrage opportunities crypto has to offer. [Sparkdex]( will receive a lot of crypto bridges customers because of this.

Coinbase owns over 900 thousand Bitcoin.. It isnt a matter of IF it gets hacked but only a matter of when. These centralized exchanges leave your assets vulnerable. It takes no time at all to create a [DEX]( because it requires no KYC... Just a username and YOUR generated private keys.  If you are confused about how all this works please let me know

The companies that will achieve mass adoption are the ones who can create a solution for bitcoin where the end users don't even realize they are using it. No knowledge needed

The past-tense verb doesn't make it any better. Bitspark is a lot simpler with over half a million cash point locations

centralized and not user friendly... misuse of customer data creates a lack of trust. bitspark provides a better alternative.
