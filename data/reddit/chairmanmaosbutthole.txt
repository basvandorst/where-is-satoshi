It's because people still explained as something to invest in rather than to use. If you're not investing in it you don't need the ins and outs of how it works, you don't need to know about hashing is etc. Same as you don't need to know about the databases that PayPal uses and how different websites use their API to make your payments.
But whenever anyone asks how to use Bitcoin 95% of the time they're going to get an overwhelming amount of detail.
The unfortunate part is that at the moment quite a bit of that "too much detail" is still needed to be able to use it. It needs to be abstracted away behind better UIs

And what kind of ethical/unethical practices do you find among Bitcoin ATMs?

Which is the relevant block chain? And how does this block chain report from the media?

Because its a well known thing about how most crypto currencys work. A video about how it also affects BCH would be as useless as this video

When I open the app I'm not able to do anything. Seems frozen. The only thing I can do is click the "read about it" link for the mnemonic phrase

Consider this. What is the point of confirmations if transactions are acceptable with zero confirmations? What does mining achieve?

What does that even mean?
