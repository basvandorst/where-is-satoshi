[Did you read the terms?](
Why did you not just buy Bitcoin?
[It sounds like you subscribed to their Bitcoin package - system of sorts that trades for you and takes half the profits...](
If it sounds too good to be true...

ur welcome. Read 3.3 again and get your money out when the term of your agreement ends. Does not sound like a legit business to me. Use the money to buy on localbitcoins...

If you read the terms it says they first deduct a "subscription amount" before starting trading... Does not say how much - could be most of your deposit lol.
3.1. The System is intended for automated trading based on the implementation of trade signals provided by the provider of trade signals (the System) on the basis of the subscription chosen and paid by the Member of the System. The subscription is fulfilled by selecting one or more corresponding Packages as indicated in the corresponding table on the web page 
3.2. The subscription price is refundable; it is debited from the balance on the Account of the Member of the System at the time of its activation and is refunded to the balance of the Member of the System upon the expiry of the subscription period as specified in the Trading Days column for the corresponding Package in the table on the web page 
3.3. In the event of early termination of the Agreement or refusal to subscribe for a Package, a fine of 30% as well as all previously accrued profits are deducted from the total amount of the corresponding Package. All refunds are processed up to 70 trading days.

Thank you. Probably too much hassle for 6.5 coins from a 2013 wallet which I was super-excited about only to find the coins were really spent :(

...and just to prove you wrong, this rally will carry to $7,500 to $10,000 before a meaningful pullback. Then, you'll earn the curse of the 'newbs' for sowing doubt about getting in on a good thing. lol. IMHO, better to say invest a small amount now and be prepared cost average on a pullback or even lose it all. INVEST ONLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

If Bitcoin goes up quite a bit more slowly than the recent tear (say 5% per month as opposed to 10% per day lol) then you'll have you 1 BTC in approx 3 years. (and the 1 BTC would be worth $21,000!)

how do you check? how many clams (is it?) per wallet?

[This goes way back]( - I did not realize you could send 1 satoshi over the network without a fee - is that possible?
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:41:46
I wish I could take your gold and give it to him.

F GROW UP - 2015 Article it's called **IRONY**
EDIT: For those who automatically downvote: I found this article perusing the bitcoin has died articles from the past and found this one to be instructive - it gives perspective that the fear mongering never stops. What I found instead is there is a lot of stupid people out there... 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:35:08
I guess I should have highlighted the irony of the post. I also find ironic the reflexive and automatic (and stupid I might add) downvotes :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:38:06
is it you stupid? I missed you :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:51:37
1099k reports total transactions - has nothing to do with income. [Read this.]( -- Not sure why they even supply it for Crypto traders. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:49:44
I would wait to see if there is truth to the rumor that the G7 meeting will make a statement about Bitcoin and Crypto in general. Buying here is really risky especially given that the last high (and channel bottom) is at $27,189 
BTC has a history of retracing all the way to the last high, so, be warned.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:25:19
Can you please explain the advantage of HW of a brain wallet? I've been meaning to ask this forever. :)
Also, unrelated, what do you think of Monero? seems to have some very dedicated following.
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:17:52
Curious what time period did LTC fall from $50 to $1?
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:13:10
Would you say the exact same thing and think the reaction would be the same if it instead said "The carnage was as brutal as the Auschwitz and Sobibor camp killings over 70 years ago."?
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:29:12
Blockchain does not keep a copy of your private key or passphrase - so you should be OK. Just don't lose the passphrase!
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:46:41
I don't think it'll be a case of good publicity - maybe for crypto awareness but will associate the company name with poor taste/poor judgement/bad journalism.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:58:11
hmmm.... so your prior comment becomes all of a sudden inappropriate? "There's no outrage and there should be no outrage.
Personally I think that journalist has bad taste, but so what? The article contains correct and timely info."
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:13:16
I hope you're already using that. I was going to suggest selling BTC for LTC then get back into LTC @ Polo but it looks looks like the $10k limit applies as an 'aggregate limit.' :( 
Next workaround is using another account to withdraw during the next fews days. Good Luck!
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:17:56
Needs to be upvoted to front page so they are properly shamed.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:01:32
Isn't it a default $10k daily limit?
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:15:57


can you link to their budgets?
