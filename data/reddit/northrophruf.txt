He may have been an asshole to some people, but even assholes make sense sometimes. And they make life a little more fun.

Yeah, please do! I look forward to buying something from you.
Edit: changed "totally" to "please do". 
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:11:23
You make a good point.

Sounds like he understands the basics! Good to hear!
I don't like to conceptualize it as [totally] virtual currency, though. One can print a "ticket" out and carry it around just like fiat.

Yes, correct. I can't imagine that being too difficult, though. There are a lot of great minds capable of tackling the issue, so-to-speak. 
It would potentially cut down on litter and pollution, as well. People wouldn't be throwing so-called trash down so readily, either.

What's the problem or issue with "dynamic block sizes"? Seems like a compromise in and of itself. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:18:50
Why is a "dynamic block size" not being talked about more? It seems to me to be a good option. If we need bigger blocks, we get bigger blocks. If we don't, we don't. 
Spammy or micro-transactions could be limited, if that became a concern, couldn't they? Dynamic block sizes with safe-guards and contingencies built-in, such as for spam, (with potential to add more) would mitigate a lot of the issues arising from both sides - seems like. Why are we not talking more about this?
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:56:56
I agree that we should be considerate and take our time. I'm not sure that dynamic block sizes are anymore gameable than either of the other options, though, say in five years, are they? There would have to be, naturally, contingencies for spam attacks and more, but with enough time I think we could get an amicable start and/or compromise with the ability to add more [safe-guards/contingencies] as the spammers/cheaters/thieves continued to expose the initial flaws. 
Surely it's easier said than done ... eh, just throwing it out there, anyway.

Depends on how often and the means by which it happens, also.

Not meaning to be overly pedantic, but ideas can and do hold value. The world is round or such and such molecule will fight so and so type of cancerous cell. 
I just don't understand how it can be said that all ideas unequivocally hold "zero value." 
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:49:09
Yeah, there are certainly a lot of people out there. It's hard to conceptualize or really grasp billions. 
Either way, I wouldn't say that an idea that's not patented is worthless. Volvo's 3-point safety-belt comes to mind. It may not be *immediately* or "quarterly earnings" valuable, but some such things aren't "worthless" either.
