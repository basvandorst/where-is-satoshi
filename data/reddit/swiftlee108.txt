At this rate Bitcoin cash won't become an Alt

Very uncomfortable ��

I was planning to buy it a few days ago but I decided its best to wait for segwix2 confusion to bring chaos to BTC value. I'm expecting a significant dip. That's when I intend to purchase. Others will tell you to buy now. But everyone has their own speculation.

Coinbase will charge 1.49% which is ridiculous considering I have £10k... £149 is a lot tbh
In addition to the £149 they will take I will also have to wait 5 days to confirm my bank account.

I’ve fished around and they all seem to incorporate big fees.

I can already see the incoming rally. ��

So roughly when do you think the bubble bursts?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:33:28
If you have your public key. go to blockchain.info and see if your funds are still there.

Apparently a quarter of bitcoins have been lost though so much less than 16mill

Not unless amazon accepts it

I would highly recommend you wait a week or so since a fork is going to happen which will drastically reduce the BTC price? Buy low just before the fork and sell high after the fork? 
Alternatively, If you can't wait and it's urgent then fly Asap to HK, cash out, exchange into BTC's then fly back asap and exchange back to USD. Good Luck

But I heard the BTC price decreases as we get closer to a fork. Perhaps not in this case?
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:54:23
Bs. You can never stop bitcoin transactions within the USA, only corporations will stop accepting it.

I would recommend he withdraws his funds slowly overtime so that he doesn't raise any flags. Unless he's planning to buy a lambo or something lol

But what time do we join the market ��
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:52:57
sorry big man
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:38:44
Gdax/coinbase same thing.
I’m trying to get funds into either account but it’s very troublesome and tedious

"it really doesn't matter too much in terms of this month or next"
It actually does because we both know how volatile BTC is. I have a strong feeling that BTC will go down to $5300 as we gear towards a controversial fork. I'm unsure whether to wait for that bear though.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:46:35
I don't understand why bitcoin goes up as we get closer to 2x. Shouldnt the 2x cause further confusion and bring it down as we get nearer to 2x?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:16:16
Irrelevant whether it happened or not. This is obviously a hypothetical question
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:11:25
I'm confident If I go all in now and hodl I will eventually get a good return but I'm just unsure of when to go all in..
