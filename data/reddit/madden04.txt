Does it require someone to know how the real estate market works in order to determine there's a bubble?  it's all conjecture until something drastic happens like a burst.

It's actually crazy how easy it is to manipulate the markets.  Can't believe anything anymore, remember when Vitalik Buterin 'died'?  Another crash... just shows you how unstable these cryptocurrencies are in these early days of the technology.  Maybe one day it'll stablize to the point where this shit doesn't happen as frequent.
