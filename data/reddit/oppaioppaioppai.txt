BTC price is volatile lol

Asking this might be a no no for this sub, but wasn’t there a time when everyone was suggesting to convert BTC to Monero and convert back as the safest way? 
Or did this method sucked after my one year absence from following Cryto news? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:31:10
Is there any website for this? 
Isn’t it a secure risk to hand over our BTC to a 3rd party? Or is it all auto generated? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:41:52
Curious. 
How difficult (or how easy) to buy a bitcoin then?   
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:01:06
Sounds like a pedo ring.

Due to the limited type of coins you can fit in one ledger nano (5 max. Ledger Blue 8), you need a couple if you trade/hodl alt coins.

urm... how do we test the private key/seed word on? is there a website like myetherwallet? or I have to use Electrum? 
@_date: 2019-03-02 08:32:17
Agree.  Just use whatever is working.   
Too much SJW is killing our industry.   
@_date: 2019-03-28 02:50:26
Helpful post.   
Thanks.  
I’m still using Electrum on my laptop.  But with the recent Electrum server hijacking(?) issues, is there any other desktop app that I can use? 
I prefer not to use mobile wallet.

Can also interpret it as
"Hey girl, I got no money for candlelight dinner. I've put in all my money into Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-06-04 07:43:32

A lot of new money came from regular folks who jumped on the bandwagon when the News kept talking about BTC breaking ATH. Most of them don't know about B2X and all the dramas. 
They are just waiting for it to hit 10K.
