I feel like this summarizes US politics pretty well

Or just the fact that BTC news is all over the internet these days and becoming mainstream news on such reputable sites like WSJ and NYT.  Just shows how much awareness has been raised over the past few months.

My friends are all hesitant because they look at the price now compared to the price just a few months ago which is fair from their perspective.  I then explain how high some of the price predictions are and that its a long term investment and they could be thinking next year as prices settle in the thousands how they missed the boat while it was in the hundreds.

Coinbase is safe to buy with, just don't use them as your wallet to store all your BTC, try a paper wallet

Looks like the Android Coinbase App called "Bitcoin Wallet"

I like this quote from this article:


I think its one of the first few times I've heard a higher ranking politician actually acknowledge that cash is still used as the primary currency for illicit activities and also that our own banking systems have volatility and issues.

I tell people now when they ask if it's to late that they wouldn't want to not buy now while it's between $400-700 and 2-3 years from now look back and say "man I should have bought in for &lt;$1,000".

So if a company that uses Gmail Enterprise was to just lose every single message they have ever sent, you don't think that would affect incomes and life savings?  What if a sales guy that was about to close 10 contracts within the next week and would make $15,000 off those contracts just lost every single message that was sent between those potential clients? What would happen as a consultant, if I lost every requirement, message, question, etc that I've had with a client? What would happen in a customer service rep lost every single message that tracks the cases they needed to help customers with? Gmail going down could absolutely ruin lives.

Especially if those experiences include your child becoming filthy rich like if they became the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg...

And companies that have had all communications through Gmail Enterprise? They would just move forward with a new email service and not worry that every single message relating to their business and their success is just gone?

Paper wallets are easy and let you keep your BTC's offline.  They are simple to use, just create a new one, print it off and then if you use Coinbase you can use the Private Key on your Paper Wallet to send your coins to the paper wallet address.  There is also a QR Code if you want to scan using the Coinbase App.  I've used [Bitaddress.org]( for my paper wallets.  The wallet also has a public key if you want to receive money from other people.  You can also check the funds in each paper wallet you own using [blockchain.info](
EDIT: Companies like Coinbase could technically lose or have their btc's seized if the government decided too, storing on an offline wallet is usually recommended and just keep smaller amounts in Coinbase for any small purchases you may want to make.

The same could be said with investments like BTC which are very well known for being extremely volatile and risky to invest in.  People that lost their money because of an exchange like MTGox going down would and have learned a painful lesson: don't invest more then you're willing to lose without a backup plan and diversify that portfolio.

What type of specs are we talking about here? It's pretty impressive.
