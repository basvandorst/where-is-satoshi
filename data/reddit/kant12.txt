What you're missing is that it's criticizing an outdated way of thinking and not literally every individual that is part of the generation. That's why it's OK to use it when replying to someone younger. You can be 20 and have outdated ideas.

Yes, it is communication ending but why is that a problem? When someone is being unreasonable you can only communicate with them so much before it becomes pointless.

It's "priced in" whenever being "priced in" supports your argument.

I don't know about you, but I'm just looking for a quick buck.

Your bad math sure equals ??? alright.

Sure but what if it doesn't just follow? Bitcoin is the best and will likely improve on trends. I wouldn't be surprised if it hits $425,000,000,000

Supply isn't decreasing. It's just increasing at a slower rate. The demand would still need to increase at that rate or greater and can't simply stay the same. 
Besides it's really only useful to think in these terms with commodity markets and things people actually have a real need for. Too many people don't need bitcoin they just buy it because they're hoping for easy money and since there's so few people and the volume is so low it's very prone to manipulation and speculation. There's really no good gauge for what demand is or will be so it's not even worth considering.
