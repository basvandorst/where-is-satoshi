I remember in the beggining of the story during IPVO I read prospectus and asked him how did he intend to actually make money and profits for me as a potential shareholder. He failed to answer, so none of my funds were there.
I encourage everyone to do the same in the future.

They can't opress any guy who did nothing wrong, didn't kill, steal, rape, trade drugs, who pays every tax and whose crime consist only in that he loves some technology uncle Sam doesn't like. It's very unpopular particulary if there are many such a guys.

Or you have a choose in security-speed trade off. It couldn't do harm to say the least. But it's not so hard to imagine a trade when minimum 10 minutes waiting time is unacceptable

In Russia we give a crap on things like this.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:39:07
Don't be so sure. A LOT of people in Russia was mining and a lot more mining right now. They got cheap electricity and significant income in russian terms. I think many coins belong to russians now, both bitcoin and alts.
But every one of them perfectly knows that won't be ANY good news for them from their goverment.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:00:27
If wall street banksters will manage to corrupt bitcoin and turn the technology out of its foundation, we could move to another crypto and fight another round.
Bitcoin is first of its kind, and many satoshi's solutions and decisions have already proven not ideal.

Bitcoin is for internet trade or large deals like buying a car or a house when security worth more than time. Credit-card solution is for cryptos with fast blocks like Fastcoin, Quark or whatever.
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:04:12
Any coin with fast block and fast difficulty retargeting. First is much more convenient for day-trade, second gives stability on hashrate jumps.

Yeah, altcois are a dangerous heresy and must be purified by the holy flame.

 Russian law is so severe. But it is compesated by everyone give a shit on it.
There is a law that noone could have a mobile phone with camera since it could be used as portable surveliance system. But still any kid has one.
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:35:11
there are coins that actually better than bitcoin by design. More convenient for trade, more fair in distribution.
If you see  a coin that actually solves a problem, with fanatic community and market cap of several dosens of millions you probably see the bitcoin in 2012.

In concentration camp there always must be controversial rules so there is always something to punish the prisoner. In Russia there are plenty of controversial laws so bureaucracy could always ruin your business, charge rent or put your in jail.
Yes you didn't obey THE LAW but there's no way to obey it.

Sad indeed. Which one altcoin(s)?

Very interesting, thanks.
I've noticed this transaction :: 
What is bitfond.com?
@_date: 2014-07-26 04:35:19
The contract terms leave it for state institution with access for classified data only. And these institutions in that country can't solve such a task as no qualified IT specialist won't work for their wages.
So this is a corruption scheme. "We tried, but in vain, TOR is untraceable, bit $100k is already distributed among our friends".

Well, a couple of decades ago russian rockets were great for that time. But now their space science is a horrible mess. Even soviet legacy started to tear apart hence these crashes happened. Hope you'll make a reliable space ship before we left without any space program on globe whatsoever.

Okay, the full story.
I catched vultr service from twitter ads. At first they seemed bitcoin friendly, working with BitPay. They even offer $5 credit while paying with crypto. I've registered and deposit some funds ($5 minimum deposit) by this transaction: 043acc4811ab8569c982cfa361c02a3be4163efe0ba6115ba078433bfa329e51. They credited funds to but as I moving to deploy a first VPS, blocked my account for fraud. You know, a-ha, we caught you and will report you to "proper authorities". Just read the letter, they claim that my transaction was generated without authorisation of wallet owner! Ridiculously epic!
I'll survive my $5 loss. Just let everyone know that when you pay with bitcoin you are in suspicion list. Then they could block you at any tiniest grounds and you will wash your name sending scans of id and proving that you're innocent. And let everyone know that this particular guys are jerks.
Maybe I'm extremely unlucky today, but my first experience with crypto payments is a strict negative. I've realised that if you pay with crypto, the seller could block you, stole your money and give you nothing for them. And most likely you won't sue them and even won't send your ID, won't break your anonimity and so on. Otherwise why did you pay with crypto at first place? And as bitcoin transactions are not authorised money transfer you won't prove anything so they are totally free to be jerks.
Now you could continue to downvote the topic. you know, see-no-evil-and-buy-buy-buy.
Have a good night.

just opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:41:33
I think we will live in enviroment of hundreds of valuable cryptocoins. Their mass will bring a true decentralization and anonimity. But only a few of them will carry like 90% of all value stored and transacted. It's sort of fundamental law of nature.
@_date: 2015-10-11 15:57:26
They do have one of the biggest e-money system in Russia. And now they stated that blockchain is quite a cheap and effective money-transmitting technology so they might adopt it as soon it become legal.

It will be the great joke if they introduce they own eBay-coin as alternative blockchain. It might supress bitcoin in some time.
@_date: 2013-08-19 07:38:40
IMO even right now litecoin is more convenient to everyday use and ppcoin is safer. I'm looking forward to final implementation of netcoin as it seems to be more advanced by-design.
Altcoins will live for many reasons. Technically for testing some questionable features. Psycologically as it is more convenient to pay 2 FTC for a beer than 0.00001 BTC. Economically as there is a demand for much faster network for a day-trade evev if it will be less safe. For decentralisation and safety of the system as a whole. To weak bitcoin to nearly-death state one need just kill mtgox, btce, bitstamp and coinbase. Much more difficult to suffocate hundred of blockchains and thousands of exchanges and services.
Gavin is just spoiling his authority and karma whinning about the very existence of "alternative blockchains", that they use his brilliant ideas and "stole value" from bitcoin

Exactly my point!
In altcoins you don't nessesarily must sit on a bunch of asics to generate a block. Terrahashes alone dont give secutity to a blockchain. How many PEOPLE are generating blocks is much more important.
@_date: 2013-08-05 15:35:34
Noone force you to use only bitcoin. If you see that bitcoins are distributed unfairly you just switch to another cryptocoin since the source is opened. And so do most of users.
