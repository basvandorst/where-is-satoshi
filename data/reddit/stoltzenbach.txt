Well imho it isn't fear of theft but rather lack of knowledge.
Hardware wallet....
@_date: 2017-02-01 10:52:43
Impossible. Read the white papers. There's allways one that finds a block first. That's the foundation of the blockchain. No double spending. And you don't find bitcoins, you get them as a reward for finding a block.

Sounds familiar :-)
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:47:34
This isn't a bubble. I wonder why you think it is. Tomorrow bitcoin can be worth $100 or $2000 though..
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:13:37
Me too! as I did in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013.. But seriously: Welcome to the club! The best thing to know/do is buy again and again and HODL
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:09:39
A nice house for let's say, 10 BTC...
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:42:03
Me too. And the smallest banknote at that time was $100 billion!
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:59:32
Yes please! And not to forget the ever repeating same question what is  a good (hardware) wallet. Checking my trezor in 3..2..1..
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:32:29
Not too many. It was an assumption and it turns out to be wrong. The selloff comes from China as I understand it
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:06:57
And as a side effect, hodlers will be very rich..

Here we go again...

Yes. In 2011, that is..

Why should you bother? It's a big, big mess in the Dutch tax department.  
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:26:32

Hodl yourself. Be your own bank!
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:23:03
Of course it is going to "crash" again. That's how you can earn fiat money with BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:40:31

@_date: 2017-03-16 09:52:44
Are you serious? If yes, don't get involved with BTC right now. Get a little bit more knowledge of this before you do.
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:34:22
My guess will be 1 bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:04:08
Bought bitcoin at $780 and now you want fiat again. That's not what I call hodl.

Yes they can. They shouldn't make such statements.

My main concern is that with ETF bitcoin can/will be manipulated like gold and silver. Thus, banksters and other large institutions on the loose again

Concerning the amount of fiat you want to convert I strongly recommend usung a hardware wallet. I use Trezor(s) for years now with great convenience.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:29:05
I still remember this opportunity to buy cheap coins.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:37:28
So just because your one experience with Coinimal went smoothly, another story sounds weird? Well, YOUR story sounds weird. Are you being paid to react like this?

@_date: 2017-01-23 13:54:36
My fear is that you are right, too..
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:58:42
What hardware wallet do you have? With a Trezor it is possible to add an additional password.

Yup. that's totally possible. And the old seed will still recover the other wallet. I have an old wallet/seed with about 40 cents in today's value. Maybe it will be worth much, much more in 15 years or so.

@_date: 2017-01-06 09:57:59
Exactly. Storing your seeds safely is of great importance, too. It might be a stupid remark but given the stories one can read here sometimes... I keep a copy of the seeds in my head, besides the paper versions.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:46:39

@_date: 2017-01-12 10:16:27
I assume this is an attempt to being funny? If not, please sell the bitcoin right now and never look at it again. Seriously.
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:28:30
You made a wise decision. It is not wise to step into bitcoin if your main drive is greed. If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:59:45
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:02:43
Yes it is very safe and the best otion at this moment, being able to hide wallet(s) with extra passphrases.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:43:35
If all that bothers you is the price going up or down, please don't start with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:35:19
I really hope so. I've allways wanted to be a millionaire..

The good part is that you don't have to believe anything since it's all open source, my dear Peter R..
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:23:08
I suppose you mean the 24h volume being zero?
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:25:46
That's exactly what can be done with a Trezor. You can protect the Trezor with a password. But also make one or more (hidden) wallets that is only accessible when you know the passphrases of them. Even if you use the recovery passwords written down on the paper.
But as i mentioned, that is a feature with a Trezor. So i don't know that this is also possible with a ledger.
@_date: 2017-01-27 08:35:32
I use it in combination with Trezor. Works flawless for me.
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:39:14
I was wrong, really thought that bridge was available for android. Thanks for correcting me.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:12:22
Thanks for sharing this. Sad for you offcourse but the good part is that this is a very strong confirmation that the potential of bitcoin is HUGHE! The banksters are shitting their pants and they have a good reason for that.
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. Mahatma Gandhi.
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:11:52
You can use your trezor with a smartphone. Just install the Trezor bridge software on it and you are ready to go. But I wouldn't recommend trading on a daily basis, unless you really know what you are doing. And my guess is you aren't so just buy small amount of bitcoin weekly or monthly and hodl for a longer term.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:56:01

@_date: 2017-01-18 20:14:23

@_date: 2017-01-07 09:30:23
It is not crashing and short term views are futile.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:33:08
I noticed that just after I posted my question to you. Should have read your reaction a little bit better.. :-)
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:28:50
It doesn't mean that you have to wait a week for a confirmation. But if you really need to have fiat money right now it can be a pain in the ass...
@_date: 2017-01-21 12:17:14
Maybe I wasn't very clear in my explanation but you did find it :-)
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:07:46
Well, that sounds familiar. But it will happen, bitcoin is still in it's child's phase..
@_date: 2017-01-15 19:14:58
Nothing yet, but they'll find their way in.
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:49:53
I can't say that it is a bargain 100% for sure. Nobody can't. Given all the info and experience I have concerning BTC, I think this is a real bargain. But my opinion might be a little biased beacause I just believe in it.
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:00:53
As mentioned already; Arnhem in the Netherlands. Check out yourself. I live near that city and bitcoin is widely accepted here.
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:08:11
You are partially right, if you want to convert from/to fiat, that is. It takes me 1 hour to 1 working day to convert BTC to my fiat bankaccount. The percentage is 1 to 1.5% in fee.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:57:46
I use Mycelium to pay for food online, every week. Works really great. There's no delay in it and it works flawless. But I only store 0.1 BTC max. on it.

@_date: 2017-01-08 17:12:06
I have no problem at all in trying to be patient whatsoever. Frankly, I have a lot of patience with people that are interested in bitcoin in general. Does that answer your question? please feel free to be honest, I'm more than willing to explain it somewhat more extend if you have the need for that. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:10:10
Very well explained. And once you get the picture, you understand that bitcoin can be seen in different ways. As a currency, a technology and a normal stock. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:13:32
I think you've given the answer to your question yourself already. If you don't use a wallet with an extra passphrase, someone ho can get hands on your cryptosteel, steals all your bitcoin. And you might get the '5$ wrench method" treat as well someday. Just find a way to remember your passphrase(s) at all times.

@_date: 2017-01-04 20:40:17
I agree. Wat I mean is that at this moment for me personally it is just handy to maintain a fossile bank account. With a minimum of fiat on it to pay some monthly bills.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:23:54
I guess you are more than willing to buy them all at the current bargain price?
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:20:17
Good idea. Sell bitcoin at a low and buy ripple high. Oh wait..
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:06:20
The broker I use all the time sends the bitcoin directly. After 1 confirmation I can spend them if I would like that. When I sell to them the money is transferred every day at 1:00 PM. At a 1to 1.5% premium.
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:06:00
Trying not to be rude, but if you need help to find out how many antminers you can operate I have only 1 advice: Don't start with it and just buy your coins. Seriously.
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:33:50
Oh no, gold and silver are lost!
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:23:28
You are not talking nonsense. You even could be right and there could be another dump the next weeks but my guess is that this steep downward price is just a correction and that from now on the price steadily will go up again. It already has begun to do so. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:52:22
Bitcoin is dead. 489th time..
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:35:33
I expect to buy some more
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:42:24
Exactly. And 2nd best is a concealed firearm in combination with good self-protecting skills..
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:05:17
Yes. And now more and more peolple are beginning to realise that the silver (and gold) market is manipulated. Big time. So my guess (and hope) is that all of these commodities will suck up dollars/euros/etc. like never seen before. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:42:55
It just ain't gonna happen. Economics 101..
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:24:31
That you followed the advise and sold everything. No one knows that you still own bitcoin and in the meanwhile you keep buying small amounts without speaking to them about BTC. Ever.
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:08:52
edit: I see you have free electricity. That changes the game a little bit. But someone has to pay for it so maybe it won't last that long.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:34:06
I agree but they are not only rather vague but even wrong in their explanation. They claim that the more bitcoins there are mined, the more difficult the mining will be.
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:58:57
There won't be any ETF approval. And bitcoin really doesn't need that either. It would be another tool for the establishment to corrupt an asset, like done before with gold and silver. To mention a few.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:48:54
Have fun with your small change!
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:10:24
Well you can look at it in an optimistic way: If you never reach 1 BTC this means it will rise in value very fast. And so is your .75 BTC..
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:43:09
Trezor software is 100% open source

Sounds they're getting a little desparate at the agency...
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:55:36
In addition to this, If the price of gold rises, more will be mined because it will be more profitable to do this. The mining rate of BTC is more predictable.

@_date: 2017-01-06 10:17:32
Exactly what I thought...
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:17:48
Wishful thinking. Bitcoin should't take it too personally. MSM doesn't research much at all. Parroting, that's what they are good at. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:58:03
I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe youre just jealous because you don't live in a country where one can buy bitcoin? Ever heard of the city Arnhem in Holland? That's today's bitcoin world capital. Please don't scream scam based on nothing. Oh well, my guess is you live in the US. And it's well known that the average US citizen isn't aware that there is a whole world outside their country. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:34:55
Yes it can.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:58:02
They allways forget to mention that before bitcoin existed, there, a criminal market was there allready as well. Besides that it's a rather fine article imho.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:20:08
And the next, and the next...
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:06:24
You don't. You are your bank.
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:35:16
It seems that you might have invested too much in bitcoin. Never invest more than you're willing to lose. Try to look at it at the long term (weeks, months, years). And as a christian I don't think you should try to fight your demons. You'll never win. But there is someone who can and will win that fight for you..
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:06:30

The difficulty has risen about 17% or so. The hashing power is down, I guess due to the fact that a lot of miners (temporarely) shut down their mining activities. I already expected this, the price is going down as I expected too. My guess is that all of this this will be corrected within a week or so.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:31:23
Well, I allways try to be patient and to help bitcoin newbees. But you see the same questions here over and over again.  Questions of which the answers can be easily found everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 10:47:02
Trezor, It has the advantage to make hidden wallets with extra passphrases. Something you can't do with a Ledger, to my knowledge.
@_date: 2017-01-08 10:40:59
I think you have a little problem. But not concerning bitcoin. Maybe you should buy some reading glasses or something.
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:03:17
Only a few days in 2017 and we already have winner of the Bllshit award for this year. A pyramid scheme, lol.
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:08:12
Leuke reactie, dat moet ik toegeven.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:51:29
Ik gebruik zelf meerdere Trezor hardware wallets en Mycelium op mijn android smartphone voor kleine transacties. Met een trezor kun je meerdere (verborgen) wallets tegelijk gebruiken. Ik vind het verreweg de beste hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:50:40
After almost 1,5 years i finally can tell you that panic selling isn't my thing anymore. Hodling nice and cosy..
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:08:14
I must apologize, you are 100% right. I really thought this was'nt possible with a Nano S. Thank you for your information. So what hardware wallet would you choose and why? I guess it's no surprise if I tell you that I use Trezor(s)...
@_date: 2017-01-31 07:09:04
Yes. And remeber, what goes up must come down. My long term predection: Up.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:09:47
There you have me. please don't tell anybody.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:48:20
You are right. Since reddit is U.S. based, 1.5 is the correct notation. In my country it isn't, here we write 1,5. It was just a little mistake. A assume that your Dutch is not so good as my English anyway so I have to be the one that has to adopt here. I apologise.
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:23:37
And it is easily possible to divide BTC even more if the need ever may occur. Can't wait for that day :-)
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:58:54
Very good, very deep analysis.
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:38:37
No. With a Trezor you can use additional passphrases to make (hidden!) wallets. So if you recover your trezor with the 24-word seed, you still need the extra passphrase(s) to recover all your wallet. But nobody can tell IF there are any hidden wallets on your trezor. You can keep a small amount on your trezor that are accessible without the extra passphrase(s) and hide the rest. Asking for the extra passphrase(s) can be turned on or off. That is a very secure feature that a Ledger doesn't have. So far I know, that is. I use Trezor(s). 
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:01:11
Buy all the bitcoin you can afford. Buy them a week ago, even better!

@_date: 2017-01-25 16:03:24
Graag gedaan. Ik weet niet wat die andere gast aan het schreeuwen is maar ik zou hem gewoon negeren als ik jou was. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 21:28:58
No, bad idea, bitcoin will be totally banned by China soon. All of them. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:38:29
I couldn't care less about how i should view bitcoin, as given by advice from any bank in the world.
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:21:30
It will go down to below $250,63. Within 2.65 hours from now.
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:41:34
Time to find the next block is already 14 minutes again.. Total congestion.
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:29:16
About $0.12 per transaction
@_date: 2017-01-08 10:44:13
Maybe it's something for me then, I'm coping with some rather tight coins.
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:32:53
Of course we're still good. Did I miss something important  the last weeks??
@_date: 2016-12-31 13:20:14
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:29:28
Look at the example they give themselves my dear fellow. It will cost you about 5 euro to send an amount of €10.000 to Great Britain. So that's like 10x more expensive. And it will take 1-4 working days. Really, if you own bitcoin Transferwise becomes obsolete.
@_date: 2017-01-07 07:51:18
Correct, I'm aware if that. Everybody should.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:47:32
Because I can't. Nobody can. But serious, I think that bitcoin will be more worth in the future. How much and when? Don't know. Nobody does.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:57:30
You try that annotation in a Dutch Excel version. Good luck, it will be seen as plain text.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:11:07
The good news is that the IRS understands the massive  potential of bitcoin. The bad news is that they (governments) will do everything to control it
@_date: 2016-12-31 11:39:54
Not to mention FARC. Even better track record. LOL
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:28:21

Welcome aboard. Aaaand... another one that understands it.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:56:51
Cheaper, faster, no middleman needed, nobody can stop you doing a transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:52:45
I don't think you are a retard. It was just a nasty bump in your learning curve as an early adopter! The vast majority of people that don't no anything about btc right now are the retards. I wish you a very good 2017!
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:21:38
Buy a Trezor. Besides that I keep like 0.1 BTC on my Mycelium wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:43:05
They support Bancontact. They're fast in bitcoin delivery (10 mins.) and when selling I have the money on my account the next working day or even the same day. Plus the premium is very acceptable.

I see mini heaters in this picture. Nothing more.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:31:25
You are right. America is a Republic. And you should be greatful for that.
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:16:37
It is possible to suppress the price. Look what will happen if the Winklevoss brothers get a green light for their ETF business. It will be to the advantage for those with lots of fiat money. But bitcoin cannot be closed down completely this way.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:13:21
Digging their own graves eventually. A shame that a lot of innocent people will "die" in the process.
@_date: 2016-12-28 12:31:23
Concerning all that is happening around the world right now, any calculated or speculated price resistance COULD be crushed like if it was nothing.
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:16:10
Speak for yourself please. Many thanks, A rather huge part of the rest of the world...
@_date: 2016-11-09 10:15:45
Classic Bloomberg has spoken..
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:52:25
You don't need to be an investor to get money from place a to b instantly, without paying rediculous fees. You just need to understand bitcoin. And it doesn't matter what price bitcoin is at that moment, it's irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:32:18
I think that ETH has advantages over BTC. My concern is that it is too difficult for many people. As it already is with bitcoin. But maybe in a few years it's a different game.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:22:08
It's obvious that electronic devices would be destoyed. But to destroy the entire btc network isn't that easy. So always keep paper copies of your seeds. and agreed: if an EMP occurs, bitcoin might be the least of your concerns at that moment..
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:23:26
I still consider this as one mistake, though. You are way ahead of &gt;99% from all the people on this world. Believe in BTC and in yourself mate!
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:31:22
And in addition to this, when you ever need to recover your trezor, it asks for those 24 words randomly as well.
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:25:03
When connected there's an option called "wipe device". After that just disconnect and connect again and it will generate a new seed.
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:16:13
Your major problem will be that you'll only spend money. Except when you have free electricity, then you might earn a few cents a day..
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:18:32
Yes. As is tomorrow, the day thereafter, etc..
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:58:52
Speading is the best thing to do, and just a little bit of shit fiat
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:44:10
1000 mbtc. Or even 100.000.000 Satoshi. But the last one is wishful thinking.
@_date: 2016-12-28 12:22:45
No one in the world can stop you to send or receive BTC to anyone. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 11:43:21
Bitcoin is better than the dollar and all other fiat crap since the genisis block.
@_date: 2016-12-23 09:19:54
Exactly my first thought too..
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:58:50
The story is that it is spelled HODL
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:41:28
But it's all just a theory of course.
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:01:09
Practically all the cheap miners (the ones that can make profit) are based in China. Just buy your bitcoin, unless you get electricity for free. Don't invest in mining. Really.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:59:44
They can't. Wrong prediction. IMHO..
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:57:53
I find it difficult to remember all those dying dates. Still remeber my 24-phrase trezor passwords, though..
@_date: 2016-12-28 12:20:20
To me it seems that the only one that is currently hodling your BTC AND your dollars is your smart broker...
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:33:32
Ok, I think i am very responsible regarding my assets. But I'll tell you a secret: I have had a photo of my Trezor passwords stored (not even encrypted) on my Android smartphone for at least a full year... KNOWING THE GREAT RISKS OF THIS.
Just reset the whole thing this week. So who's talking about being a retard or being financially irresponsible now?
@_date: 2016-12-28 12:28:07
A very important factor for BTC to succeed, indeed.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:25:13
Yup. Unbelievable that so many people still believe that the earth is heliocentric. But what has this to do withe BTC?
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:10:40
Well this is rather strange. The uploaded video is not available in my country. But its origin IS my country..
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:48:14
You will lose the discussion for a long time from now. By the time you're even or winning and you probably  might retire forever. HODL..
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:22:28
Nobody knows what will happen but i very agree with your thinkings!
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:05:14
IMHO you totally need help understanding btc. 101..
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:52:07
No. Because slowly but steadily there will be more and more people that understand bitcoin. So the demand for btc will allways be and I think it will continue to grow.
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:07:07
I admit that nobody knows what will happen in the future. However,  concidering all the indicators i think that this very well could be a sustaining bullrun that will end much higher, say $2500-3000 per BTC
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:49:18
No offense, but... How stupid must one be to be to buy Bitcoin ETF?? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:29:32
Would people really buy BTC ETF? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:03:11
Someone who isn't him..
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:07:31
I live near a city where there are a lot of merchants and companies that accept BTC. When I pay with bitcoin and ask the question if BTC is used often the answer is allways the same; Just a one or a few transactions the last year. So yes, what really needs to happen is that BTC is being USED.
@_date: 2016-12-31 11:41:56
Exactly the same here. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 11:38:02
Sponsored by the government..
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:12:16
I m not ignoring you but i'm just too lazy to explain things to you any further.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:46:14
With a dedicated x-ray device it won't stay hidden because the variable aperture enables one to see such engravings (and many other details) very well..
@_date: 2016-11-05 13:58:57
Miners would just hodl their BTC for a while.. Nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:43:47
Quantum computing is developing way faster than many people believe. That's for sure.
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:03:38
I think that your balance became visible again after a new block was mined. It's a guess and the precise reason can be searched for. But it isn't that important because all seems fine now. Welcome back..
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:06:29
You are 100% right. But there's a strong correlation between regulation and control, IMHO..
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:29:05
To be more precise: Lack of regulation is bad for those who really want to control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:24:53
Kinda obvious to me this isn't legal. Keep in mind that you are solely responsible for your bank account and all that happens with it.
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:00:39
You recovered your account. I guess you have to be able to see all the transactions made then?
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:39:58
Yes. Everything is fine and works as you already assume..
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:32:00
Just curious, what was the problem?
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:43:22
After a day with a lot of stress I can finally laugh again. It's so important to relax on time.. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:16:11
Me too. Again. Since 2014. HODL.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:27:00
With ETF it will be a lot easier for players with a lot of fiat money to manipulate the price of bitcoin. The price may go up (and down) but it might get even more volatile than it is already and my guess is it will, but this is nothing organic. And what bitcoin needs right now is stability and a more constant grow. imho.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:43:03
Well, the last 2 hrs proved the opposite. But that says nothing about the coming 2 hrs :-)
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:13:21
Yup. Tried to short some recently. Wrong choice, just buy and HODL..
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:14:05
Welcome to your new life!
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:01:53
Maybe. Who knows.

Aug I get but what's so special with Jan?
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:06:45
Well actually it is a rather good comparison. But it depends if you look to it on a year to year, season or season, week to week or day to day basis :-)
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:10:03
The whole issue with BTC is that the gov has no control over it...
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:48:55
You must be confused and mean €....
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:11:33
BTC 12,000,000 / $.61 = at least 19,672,131 adresses used to store these 12 million BTC. Which is 3/4th of the market cap (in BTC, not dollars. In dollars it would be 3/4*$25,342,186,380 =  $19,006,639,785, but that too has nothing to do with it). I'd suggest: READ before doing any math...
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:09:00
EXACTLY what I was thinking! It's a sign!! Oh, wait....
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:14:15
Sold some stocks i owned, the money will be available on my bankaccount in 2 days. Going to buy some more BTC and ETH for it, no matter the price. And then HODL.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:46:43
Went to bed yesterday and the price was stuck just below €2200. When I woke up it was in the €2300. Never saw the 2200's. Luckily now I saw that too. Aaaand.... HODL...
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:03:27
BTC is designed to be your own bank. With Coinbase they are...
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:36:50
If BTC behaves like the weather, I recommend daytrading. I myself just HODL after a few expensive lessons.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:29:05
You can buy BTC at brokers here at about 0.5-1% premium. With a pay service called Ideal. You can use it with any Dutch bankaccount.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:50:04
Thanks anyway..
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:17:41
Some more I mean :-)
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:10:49
It's just a desperate attack against BTC. I mean, what else have they left after using the NSA-arsenal. To me, it's onother very, very strong sign that BTC is a real threat to the filthy powers that be. So obvious, the 'Bitcoin accpted here' logo is (mis)used with a very clear purpose and by a very clear club....
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:33:24
There will be many corrections. My guess is that BTC will be corrected to $5000 within a year.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:31:27
It would be true if the bottomline of the graph you're showing was 0 insted of 1250... It might be a bear trap though..
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:46:20
It's exactly the same. As long as you don't turn on the pc(s)..
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:56:04

@_date: 2017-05-25 19:37:48
It doesn't fail. It's just a way to make extra money for them.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:29:29
BTC is allways cheap, considering te fact that it is the new money. In other words, Fiat will be (is) worthless.
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:18:56
People have another option: Remove anything that has to do with the virus and install your backup files. Or am I the only one that makes a backup every few days?

@_date: 2017-05-10 20:33:28

@_date: 2017-05-11 20:25:09

A national currency will kill itself eventually. No need for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:47:42
Not that it is of any use for you right now, but Arnhem is (by far) the  Bitcoin city in Holland. There you can live on BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:07:01
Because Coinbase uses you.
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:16:40
100%. For sure. I mean, are you kidding me? A hacker that steals a exploits arsenal from the NSA? Says who?? Right, the NSA. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:52:24
Lessons: 
-do NOT show anyone how much crypto, money, gold etc. you have.
-Buy a Trezor, with that you can add additional safetypasswords.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:08:00
Can't wait to do business with them!
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:24:53
In that case I'll wait. Thanks for sharing this info!
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:05:58
I keep 2 copies of the seed(s), encrypted with good old Truecrypt, at different places. Furthermore , these seeds are stored in my own head as well :-)... I allways keep my Trezors with me. Yes, with a decent password for the small change wallet and hidden passphrases for the wallets containing the other 99%.. Love it being my own bank. Thanks Trezor!
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:22:43
NEVER invest in an exchange.. Put some fiat or crypto in, exchange and withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:52:03
Well, normaly the answer should be "because people tend to be stupid". But in Satoshi's case my guess would be that he indeed made some more identities.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:53:31
Made a mistake in my first comment. I Hedl 80%...
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:33:35
The 'price' never settles. Buy several smaller amounts spreaded over a few weeks if you're able to.
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:19:12
Tomorrow's breaking headline in that same good old WSJ: *'Bitcoin is dead'*.....

I am 100% convinced it's not a bubble. I only tried to make some extra fiat money. For the 3rd time this went wrong. Now I only buy and HODL..
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:32:46
Did exactly the same, with about 20% I Hedl. Bought them back at 1600 and some more. Now I only Hodl and buy more....
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:13:46
They're all 3 very safe. So it depends with you're planning to do with your BTC. Want to buy an amount at once and hodl them for a long time? Paper will do. If you want more wallets and buy and spend some occasinally than trezor or Nano are the best choice. I use trezor(s) myself. You can add hidden wallets with additional passwords and store ETH on it as well. I'm not so familiar with ledger though.

What goes up, must come down. The questions are how much and when...
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:04:13
And? What's your point?
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:52:26
I will buy when the price is &gt;$5000. By that time I am convinced...
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:03:23

Here we go again...
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:14:56
Xcuse me for the bad sentences, it's very hot here...
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:53:26
In Holland the same. A few days right now.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:30:36
Federal Reserve. It's not Federal. There is no reserve. Says Stoltzenbach.
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:52:40
Does that really exist, 50 octane?
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:59:16
Anything one wants. 
Greetings from the inventors of the tulip mania :-)
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:17:12
That whole story is compelling but for me personally it might be very useful. To be able to get some BTC, that is.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:21:50
Exactly. :-))
@_date: 2016-07-02 08:44:37
BTC and ETF go togehter hand in hand for the dumb &amp; ignorant..
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:08:43
Talking about a bad timing to post this... Spot on.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:07:52
No further information. problem solved or to upset?
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:15:42
You made a tiny, little mistake. The crash back will be to 1958,43. But I'm sure you know this. Everybody knows this. :-)
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:07:05
Can only be one. Your friend..
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:00:33
xcuse the typo
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:03:02
I use Trezor(s) myself. Very satisfied.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:02:27
Why would you get the key out of the ignition when leaving your car at your own driveway? No need for that, since it's private property. Thus, completely safe.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:12:04
Maybe it's time for a new subreddit. Closed accounts and other Exchange nightmares..
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:58:01
One of the things to secure my phrase is not to tell where it's kept.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:36:27
That's the whole deal. Western fiat money (including the petrodollar) is at its last legs.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:24:08
Ok. 2011 is very early indeed :-)
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:20:15
That's the first bar you know that accepts BTC..
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:58:22
By far the most profitable way to mine is not to mine. Buy your coins and HODL.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:11:57
Normally I used to set the recommended high fee in Mycelium, last time I set it to normal which resulted in about 10% extra on the payment of about $18
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:47:08
It has never really crashed until now, but you never know. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen..
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:12:18
Well, personally I don't spend any time or energy on those people. Because they are really dumbasses or they benefit from the system as it is now.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:57:07
Paper wallets are very safe, no discussion. But I prefer the convenience of a trezor or ledger. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:54:17
You are 100% right. It's just wishfull thinking.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:40:25
I'm not parroting something, I just gave my opinion based on the last  transaction I made. 2 Pizza's. And the fee was about 15% of the purchasing price, which was completely new for me. But you're right also; at this moment there's the mempool is small.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:51:40
Come on guys, Little Mark has the right to think what he wants. If only he kept that for himself..
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:34:47
Buy 50 now and 50 in a week or so.
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:04:24
No offence, but why should I tell anyone?
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:13:41
My guess is that a lot of banks already stash BTC. And there's Ripple, widely used by banks ofcourse.
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:53:48
In Arnhem (Holland) it's possible to pay with BTC at the Burger King for years now. And at dozens of restaurants, bars and lots of other merchants. 
Look it up: 
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:29:32
No offence, we totally agree on this :-)
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:16:36
The same. Maybe it would be a different story in the future  though
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:50:22
Well, at least there's one thing they do well at coinbase....
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:03:18
By spreading your buys there's less risk that you buy at the (a) top and suffer some loss. But buying all at once can also work in your advantage ofcourse.
My opinion is that if you're planning to hodl for a longer time (1 year or more) it will be more worth in fiat, regardless of how you buy.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:42:13
It's strange these companies still exist.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:19:20
*"He said there is a risk that consumers might think digital currencies are regulated like any other financial instrument, when in fact there are not."*
And **that's** exactly the one reason why I hodl my wealth in Bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:16:49
if you need any further help, you might PM (or just post it here) me the transacton ID that was made. So I can check what went wrong. There's little risk involved with that and certainly no ripping of BTC or something like that. Other users here wil confirm that. Anyway, good luck!  
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:28:23
That explains why their last 24hr volume is so low.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:42:24
I couldn't care less, completely out of fiat right now :-)
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:13:24
And not 15% extra as I mentioned before...
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:49:44
I don't know from which shady silly crypto that chart is, but it isn't bitcoin for sure
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:10:56
I used to untill recently But the fee is too high nowadays.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:35:52
I really cannot remember how many times this question was posted here. But I'll give you an (the) answer: Don't buy for 1000 at once, but spread it into weekly buys. 200 a week for example.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:56:02
I guess he knows the drill...
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:04:47
Beautiful. The Apollo landings on the moon. Stanley Kubricks masterpieces. And that is what he admitted in person a few yaers ago.

Part of the business model
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:02:08
I am glad that my learning curve was a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:27:13
Still waiting for that 3000 mark here. In €....
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:13:00
Professor, is it you?
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:00:02
In Arnhem (Holland) it's possible to pay at the Burger King for years now. And at dozends of bars, restaurants and other merchants. No joke, look it up: 
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:24:36
I saw it was updated but haven't looked at it. If this is true I also will swap my spare change to my Trezors. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:02:21
Dude, even if you get your electricity for free there's no way you can make a profit. In all seriousness. Do the math. Right now the Hashing power is more than 5 million TH/s. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:21:55
So now the powers that be are aware of what will happen if they're trying to restrain the mass (by banning bannotes in this case..). 
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:40:21
It isn't annoying I must admit. I won't stop using Mycelium.
