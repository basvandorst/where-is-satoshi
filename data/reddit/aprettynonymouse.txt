Do you know what a put option is? Let me answer that for you, no
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:38:18
I don't disagree it would cost a lot of money, but for a smart (market manipulating) investor this is opportunity.... and someone WILL act on it eventually
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:09:28
I now own over 50% ether :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:00:27
Im not a liar... I promise... I dont have large amounts to play with like that, Im 17. I had less than 1 coin total. I now have about 0.25.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:36:45
I agree with you completly except on one point.
I do not believe their intention is to ever put the money back into BTC, their goal is to destroy it and have BCH be the cryptocurrency with the most community support (I dont get why there can only be one in the first place....) but ya
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:37:49
It will not take 10 minutes if there are hundreds of thousands of pending transactions... no matter the fee....
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:30:08
:) Im just posting it for people with more money than me who hate BTC. I LOVE BTC, its my passion, but I hate this reddits notion that it will only go up. i have been trading since 2013 and there is so much stupidity around. That being said, some BTC supporters are easily the smartest people I've ever read, and I wish it was like it used to be when reddit BTC aficionados were all geniuses who made me look retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:01:18
The realization that the community behind BTC is not the same that was behind it when I started.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:30:41
Lol ok.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:10:40
P.S. As of 24 hours ago I officially sold over 50% of my BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:35:45
This is theory not fact, someone please explain to me TECHNOLOGICALLY why I'm wrong, not "because BTC will survive everything!!"
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:52:14
Yes but they have become the majority. ICOs, forks, ponzi schemes, and scams... I dont think BTC will die, there are so many smart amazing people behind it... But we are in a time of peril, the majority of the market is people who have no understanding of the technology and that extends to developers and miners now sadly.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:09:36
I'm sorry for being all over the place but I'm busy. I hope you understand this isn't bad information.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:07:03
You are a smart person please dont misunderstand my dumbing down some of my knowledge for reddit. I completely understand the network is "ok" but I want it to be perfect and able to scale to 100k, and I honestly dont know how to do that. I COMPLETELY AGREE a hard fork is NOT the way to do it, well at least with out the ENTIRETY OF BITCOIN'S COMMUNITY AGREEANCE, which will NEVER happen. So IDK I'm not as smart as I thought I was and I forsee a big drop, not the end of BTC, I Have a 100k dream, but man oh man we in for a rough trip.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:03:02
LOOK YOU ALL MISUNDERSTAND I DONT THINK BIT COIN IS DOOMED TO FAIL. I JUST BELIEVE IT IS IN THE WORST PLACE IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE AND ALL THE CURRENT "INVESTORS" DONT UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. THAT IS MY POINT SUMMED UP
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:51:41
You seem like a really smart dude who doesn't understand that 90% of BTC users can't even set their own fees. The goal is not to destroy BTC like you are thinking so it is beyond repair, it is too disrupt it so much nobody wants to use it. All the manipulator is tryna do is drive the price down enough for his put to PAYYYY 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:34:35
Correct, and that is how I would effectively destroy BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:54:36
Thank you! I actually have heard about them often, I am suspended from school so that seems like a good way to spend my time :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:35:17
Your transaction would take days if not weeks and have a high fee, making BTC obsolete.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:56:55
Lol "not meant for BTC yet" I have been trading, mining, and literally playing with paper BTC's since I was a tween
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:57:58
can you please explain this to me! I hope you get this message, I've been looking for cores block size increase info  for ever!
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:55:53
Although, I do believe because of its technological community based nature it can never really be doomed... Just set back into a different outcome than the one we see successful (now), whether or not BTC's purpose has already played our or has not even started yet, who knows. I hope the ladder, I really do.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:11:46
P.S. wait on all crypto currencies with Bitcoin on top for at least a while to be a publicly traded commodities(maybe?) and everyone whos been in since the beginning can EAT
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:14:44
Listen you exactly proved my point. Right now there are about under a thousand over $3. I could DESTROY that pool as we speak with the amount of BTC I have lol. Just clog that bish up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:54:16
Sadly that is the realization I came to today.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:45:53
You have to realize ALL the money is being made on your futures, who cares about how much money in fees it takes to completely clog the network to a point of disrepair. That is where the 100k estimate came in, but now that I'm thinking about how you can send "Return transactions" it would prob be even lower
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:57:58
you dont understand, I believe its gonna DROP heavily in a few weeks since none of you guys I understand the cluster fuck going on behind the technology right now. I IN NO WAY THINK IT HAS PEAKED! I THINK IT COULD HAVE IF GREEDY DUMMIES FUCK IT UP
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:57:15
I DONT!! AT ALL! BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE!
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:43:55
You are correct, but the 100k investment in this hypothetical is unimportant. I would send them all with purposely high fees.... Staggering is the way to achieve the most harm to the network.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:09:58
Oh how I hope this crash throws ETH the other way all tho short term prob taking with it
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:28:58
1. Enough temporary havoc is in theory destroying BTC due to its community based nature. Nothing can destroy it, it is literally invincible, but you could clog it enough that nobody in their right mind would ever use it again.
2. correct, with only $5000 :(
3. Incorrect, done correctly you could stagger fees and make it impossible to gain priority over your transactions.
