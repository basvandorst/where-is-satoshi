Anything to do with journalism.  Sure the bitcoin community was tacitly interested in knowing who Satoshi is; however, what Leah did was borderline criminal, and placed Dorian and his family is extreme danger.  She put a $400,000,000 price tag on Dorians forehead, and where to find him.  
I'm not censoring anyone, she's free to write whatever she wants, but I'm free to express to the world what a shoddy journalist she is.

If all the signers of the NYA switch to 2X, and that chain receives 80-90% of the hash rate, that's a huge concern.  Bitcoin Core's chain difficulty adjustment would devastate usability for months.  Mining a handful of blocks a day would create a huge backlog, and a strong incentive for users to switch to the chain that is operating more efficiently.  Unfortunately, user nodes don't mine blocks, and there's only one mining pool on that list.
I say this because an ecosystem as large as bitcoin, this can be a huge disruption and users and businesses will vote with their wallets, as they do the majority of time (just like there wasn't a massive dump of bitcoin cash, people hodl for their own economic interests)

People can cease to use Bitpays services, it's as simple as that.  No users, no Bitpay.
It appears that the companies that signed the NYA, will have to give an update to see if they are still following the 2X roadmap.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:56:18
I do understand it. Segwit2x has been activated.  They are operating under the NYA.  The plan was for a hardfork to 2M blocks.  It's going to difficult to argue with 2X, if it ends up with 80% of the hashing power.  
I get that there is disagreement still; however, core will have to change the POW to survive losing the majority of hash power.  Or, switch to 2X.

Seems to me if Bitpay was a signer of the NYA, then they are rolling out plans to adhere to that agreement.  I would also assume all the other signers of the NYA will be moving to 2X.  Otherwise, what's the point of signing in the first place?

At risk of being called all sorts of nasty names.  The White paper lists the word "consensus" exactly ONE time, and it is directly related to Hashrate/CPU power.  The consensus "rule set" is something that is being touted outside of the white paper.  Just sayin.

Correct, but the goal is to have LN do the bulk of the daily transactions.  This could be Billions of dollars floating through layer 2 at any given time.  I'm very interested in Lightning; however, the concern is real.  I'm not using LN until it's hardened

Want to reduce counterparty risk?  Buy, and hold your own bitcoin.
This is a overly complex explanation of futures, which are settled in USD.  The DOW and S&amp;P have futures that will behave similar to bitcoin futures.  The simple explanation is:  Bitcoin futures trading allows people to leverage small amounts of money (margin), to "Bet" on the price of bitcoin going up/down at a set time in the future.

No, the argument is "There will be large lightning hubs [...] one of which will likely become Paypal 2.0."
The small hubs are irrelevant when it comes to Paypal 2.0, because none of them will ever become (nor want to) Paypal 2.0.  I hope there are millions of small lightning hubs one day; however, their users aren't likely to know about each, nor will millions of small, quasi-decentralized lightning hubs become Paypal 2.0.  This can still happen with 1X or 2X.
One thing that we must all realize is that "basic users" won't care, nor will they have the knowledge or competence to open their own hub.  The simpler tech is to use, the "basic user" will gravitate towards it.  I see Paypal 2.0 (good, bad, or indifferent) as something that basic users will flock to, just as Coinbase has 10M+ users.  It's simple to use.

What you're really saying is, that "Super Users" (node operators), or people whom install &amp; run Software on the computer, has more of a "Vote", than Miners or bitcoin business or economic users?  
Node operators are in the extreme minority in bitcoin...That's why Satoshi placed such value on hash rate in the white paper.  Literally anyone can install a node, but far fewer people can run a miner

You should probably read the whitepaper.  


making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains.

I'm not particularly worried about KYC LN Hubs.  Just pointing out that Adam's statement is misleading regarding 2X &amp; Paypal 2.0.  Regardless if 1x or 2x becomes the longest chain, the fact that both are Segwit &amp; Lightning enabled, that we're bound to see Paypal 2.0 built on either chain.  It doesn't mean that the entire bitcoin ecosystem becomes paypal 2.0.  Like I said before, this is painful to watch...

Miners are individuals.  It's mining pools that centralize mining.  P2Pool is perfect for decentralized mining; however, the transaction fees are too high for the micro payments people generally receive.  Hence, they move on to pools, where they can accumulate a larger balance before they cash out.
The lightning option is intriguing, if it can be incorporated into P2Pool, then I think it would attract a lot of miners
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:36:46
The notion that Miners and businesses aren't users, baffles me.  Both have invested far more in bitcoin than the average power user, and definitely more than the casual user that downloaded the coinbase app to purchase $50.00 worth of bitcoin, because Paris Hilton &amp; Floyd Mayweather said to...
The miners &amp; bitcoin businesses are the reason that there are so many users in the first place.  They have created the buzz &amp; infrastructure to take bitcoin into the (arguably) mainstream.  
The posts arguing NO2X, or bashing miners &amp; business need to be redirected into:  *Now that the largest companies in the bitcoin sphere are supporting 2X, as well as 90% of the hash rate, what can core (and the 2X group) do to reach a compromise, without splitting the chain again.*  Which will likely result in Core hard forking immediately after, to change the POW, just to stay relevant (creating yet another chain).  It's all detrimental to bitcoin, and it's a stupid and avoidable game of chicken, which both sides created
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:47:37
If you look at the derivatives market (I believe it's closer to 1.2 Quadrillion), that equals more than all the Hard Assets (gold etc...), debt, stocks, cash combined.  Quite telling, if you believe that there is equal money on each side of each derivative contract (there's not).
Otherwise, all other items on that list, are valued as debt (Sans Hard Assets).

There are plenty of niche crypto geek projects that never go anywhere.
The reality is: it's all part of the cycle of revolutionary tech, and it fuels innovation.  Obstacles fuel innovation.  Bitcoin is ready for as many users that want it, at the moment.  Imagine the ecosystem in 2011, and now in 2017.  In 10 years, the obstacles that are viewed as a problem today, will be a distant memory, as we focus on new obstacles.

If 2X has the majority of the Hash rate, then technically they have bitcoin, according to the white paper.  Inb4 muh users.  
Coinbase has 10M+ users, and core users are 6000+ (full nodes).  Then you'll be arguing which "user" is more qualified to define bitcoin.  There is no legal basis, because if the economic user majority, and the mining majority far exceed Core-Super-Users, then, well, there you go. 
I personally despise the state bitcoin is in right now.  I've been a longtime user/miner/proponent of bitcoin.  Yet, these hard-line, scorched earth stances is what will likely kill off, or displace the greatest technical achievement in a century.

I think you believe that I care if there is a Paypal 2.0 on either 1X or 2X chain.  I don't.  I can make a point without taking a side.  
If banks/financial institutions/businesses don't open large hubs, then the utility of lightning rests in the hands of the technically inclined.  If I was a financial institution, I'd be setting up a lightning hub, as I could collect all the transaction fees.  It makes sense, as it scales to a large number of basic users.  That's the point, it really has nothing to do with smaller hubs, they'll both exist.


The "basic users" will not care about Coinbase's downsides, as long as they have a superior product, and it's easy to use.  I think you mean "Super users", they care about the downsides of centralized exchanges/hubs.  A good example is Microsoft VS. Apple VS. Linux.  Linux is superior in many ways; however, basic users have never heard of Linux. 


I never suggested the whole LN would go the route of Paypal 2.0.  That doesn't mean that a large LN Hub won't become Paypal 2.0, as the LN enables this easily.  They'll exist along with however-many-lightning-hubs in the same bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:18:07
This entire conflict is painful to watch. But the irrational arguments (on both sides) compound the pain.  The very nature of layer 2 (a la segwit/lightning) is more prone to become Paypal 2.0, because that's what the logical use case is.  There will be large lightning hubs, which are operated by financial institutions &amp; large corps, one of which will likely become Paypal 2.0.  This happens, regardless if it's segwit or 2X, they both allow layer 2.
Bip 148 was the nuclear option to get segwit, and segwit2x is the nuclear option to get a larger blocks.  When two parts of the bitcoin ecosystem go nuclear, it's bound to get a little crispy around the edges.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:50:01
That's true, but not applicable to the 2X chain.  There will be plenty of 2X nodes operating. The .15.0.1 Core software already rejects 2X nodes.  If the miners truly shift to 2X, then you'll know which becomes the longest chain.

How many of Coinbase's 10+M users even know what 2x is? Gdax has 10,000 + trade volume a day, that doesn't count any btc/ltc or btc/eth trades.  Nor does it count purchases on Coinbase itself.  Combine Gdax &amp; Coinbase, that's a hell of a lot of 2X going on, every-single-day.
And, as long as the price still says $4100, the users won't care.  There are some grave miscalculations going on in this debate.

800 nodes is more than enough for 2X to survive. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:57:57
If by what you say is accurate, then the (user nodes) chain will not become the longest chain.
There are a lot of emotional arguments about "users", but CPU power = Hash Rate.  If those "user nodes" aren't mining, then they aren't making the chain longer.  Don't shoot the messenger, but if 1X wants to be the longest chain, then all those (user nodes) should immediately start mining (something I've advocated for years).
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:50:37
If they get 80-90% of the Hashrate, in addition to 800 nodes, that's all that is needed to run the network.
Sybil nodes?  It doesn't matter.  80, 800, 8000, or 80,000 nodes.  As long as they are running as a full node, they will relay &amp; propagate the network, just like any other node.  A node is a node, is a node, is a node.  Proof of ownership not required.

Thanks for your input.  We have limited options with cut-vinyl.  For example: The black area of the picture, is cutout/negative space. The only part the decal, that is shown, is the white/orange.  I wanted to keep the actual bitcoin symbol, so that it was recognizable from a distance.
For simplicity sake, it's best for us to remove the numbers inside the 'box', because it can become too complicated to apply onto a surface.  As it sits, this particular decal, will be more difficult to apply because of the font structure.  It's a balance of design &amp; implementation.

Fractional Reserve Banking in it's current form, wouldn't work for bitcoin.
In FRB, money is 'created', based on a percentage of deposits.  Once those bitcoins are under the control of the lendee, they are taken out of the bank.  He may have a 100,000 in his "paper accounting ledger", but the actual coins (90,000) are lent out.
It would be like FRB with gold coins, except, you hand out the gold coins to your customers.  I don't know of a bank that would take that risk.
