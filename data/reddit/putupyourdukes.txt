After a major exchange just straight up stole 755k coins, this sounds like a good idea.

There is no evidence that it hasn't been about 3 percent.

I don't think you understand what hyperinflation means. 
Inflation is a natural part of our economy, we attempt to keep it at around 3 percent a year. So naturally, things cost more over time. IT also means you need to make sure your investments return at least 3 percent annually and you get an annual raise of 3 percent per year. 
Ron Paul has been predicting hyperinflation. Which means 50% or so higher per month.

He's been predicting hyperinflation for how many decades now? We barely have 2-3 percent.

Losing half your value in a day isn't a good thing.

somewhat of a juvenile outlook. Why not sell now, wait for it to drop more, and buy while it's lower?

that and it's backed be a legit currency not a pyramid scheme like bitcoin.

No, they got it spot on. The crash is happening because people are realizing it's essentially worthless. The more deflation ,the less value it actually has, because no one wants to spend them.

We all knew bitcoins were bullshit to begin with, this crash to zero isn't unexpected.
