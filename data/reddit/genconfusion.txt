well man let me tell you from experience, I would never wish my kids away or regret having them but i'd be lying if I didn't say that my wife and I would probably have a better quality of life in terms of financial stability and freedom to enjoy ourselves if we had no kids. And it's not like I'm working a job at Walmart, I make a decent wage.  I have no idea how someone raises kids working at walmart or mcdonalds.

aah once again HSBC dusts its shoulders and goes on it's merry money laundering ways, and the rest of us pay the price with additional control and regulation on how we access our own damn money.

Jack Lew discussed cryptos with Jamie Dixon. Good grief is this man made of Teflon?

Depending on the type of account you do get interest. Also the idea is they are providing you a service in exchange for using your money. It always remains yours. The idea behind banking isn't bad IMO, the problem is the assholes that run them.

This is lost on so many people.  Two people equally smart and equally capable can end up with dramatically different financial situations based entirely on their choice of major.

Wow this guy left an e-mail trail of all that. That's pretty stupid.

What's the big deal? There are several other coins with bitcoin in their name. Almost nobody confuses one for the other.

But it sounds like wise and they have a website so it must be good right?

Who cares she had the bitcoin and that's all that matters apparently.

Great idea, screw with one of the longest standing, most dependable companies associated with bitcoin when the biggest crit against the coin is it's instability and risk.

Interesting.  I use wells as my primary bank and haven't heard anything from them.  I'd be ticked off too if they called.  It's none of their business.
