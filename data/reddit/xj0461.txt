That's a dumb reason to leave it up. Just because it is popular with the same demographic does not mean it should be allowed in this sub.

Which part do you think is bad? Banks leading out money or banks being required to hold onto a fraction of the deposits it holds?

The fractional reserve system is very important for the economy. 
Edit: It seems that many of you are against this system, but that does not make it any less important in the we have now.

If the fractional reserve system was never implemented could we still have a strong economy? Possibly, I suppose. Personally, I believe that the system as a whole is beneficial to society. 
In your sec on point are you referring to the central bank being able to print out fiat money? 
And I'm not certain I fully understand what your saying in your last point. I don't want to respond to it if I am not interpreting it correctly.

Quietly describes how they dropped it, not the effect it will have.

Odd since it can handle prices in the hundreds of thousands just fine (e.g. BRK.A).
