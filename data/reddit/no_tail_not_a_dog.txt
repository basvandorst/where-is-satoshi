But there isn't really any reason for that, is there?

Lol. And why are you interested in BTC? Just think they're pretty?
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:29:30
Yeah I know. The thing is 


that the main person I was telling to buy BTC all summer was my husband, but he won't listen and we have separate bank accounts/I'm unemployed at the moment so I have no access to his cash. I don't see BTC as a way to make fast cash immediately, but an investment for a some years down the line. Fuckin sucks, people are hell. 


Yeah. I would have zero remorse about cheating the system and not working though-- the world functions by capitalism, that's the deal, and I've internalized the idea that there isn't any shame in making money without working hard as long as you got the money yourself and it wasn't gifted to you. I think that's an unfair double-standard honestly but I pretty much only feel shame according to society's judgements so that doesn't matter.

You're coming off as really desperate for female attention, it's sad.

I'm mad? Which one of us keeps leaving one sad, lonely downvote on the other's comments? **You, because your butt hurts.**

Why does that not surprise me?

No one who gets rich really earns it, there are starving women in Africa who work all day. It's all a game but  the game dictates our real lives and I'm rightfully remorseful that I didn't play it well.

You're like those fuckers in 2013, just shut the fuck up and stop pretending to be the paragon of morality and self-sacrifice just to jerk yourself off.
