Inflation = stimulates economy and devalues the currency.
Deflation = stagnation of economy due to  hording.
Theoretically a good form of money should be one that inflates ever so slightly simply to offset the difference in value caused by lost coins.

However, you can still make profit by selling and buying on different exhanges. 
I remember around January 22 when Grin was being placed on exchanges I did intact find a price difference of 30%
I didn’t do anything about it because I was clueless; but you can theoretically repeatedly cycle through exchanges and each sell would net you 30% profit.
That sorta thing is both astronomical, and extremely rare; and will most likely only happen on new, low-liquidity coins.

Regardless of how the balance of power is maintained there’s one simple question that needs to be answered.
Who does the system benefit.
It’s worth noting that the article is still misleading; you are still losing purchasing power; and it explains that your purchasing power is retained so long as it’s invested in something else that even mildly appreciates in value.
Hell its black and white, if you left your money in a shoebox you would have lost purchasing power. DUH! But realistically, how many people are investing in better stores of value? Not many.
So, yes, essentially the average person is still losing purchasing power. Done.

I’d say bitcoin is middle aged when you look at how much has already been mined. 
I could see Bitcoin reaching around a million dollars in the next 10-15 years- but I couldn’t see it going very much higher; so that said it’s already matured quite substantially.
I could not say bitcoin is very young when compared with those aspects.

True, but holding crypto is like a game of poker to me.
Know when to fold (or exchange to stablecoin) have a failsafe plan and stick to it always. Always be aware of your surroundings and look for Tells (always keep an eye on the markets)
If I saw it drop like it did in 2018, I would exchange to a stable coin as soon as it reaches the point I plan for, I don’t push my luck and tell myself “well it might go back up!”
Nope, exchange and hold till a well founded confidence is built up.
Of course; markets are unpredictable, but you can stop your losses earlier rather than later.

I was thinking about it a lot, it’s almost as if they didn’t shill, where would bitcoin even be.
People are trying so hard to introduce a concept that isn’t working. Thinking bout how bitcoin can revolutionize the banking system, when in the end, it’s turning into another banking system. Fees are making exchanges profit and turning exchanges into the new banks.
Hell, look at binance, all they have to do is become the biggest exchange, start dropping BnB outlets across the world and pretty soon BNB May just consume all the other cryptos to the point where BnB will be the reserve currency that will just be backed by all other crypto’s. 
It’s not that hard to imagine exchanges dominating the market; imagine binance buying coins directly from miners at a discount then selling the coins potentially at such a deal that other exchanges will have trouble competing; they could literally dominate if they expand their reach far enough.
Kind of creepy to think about; so that’s why I like the concept of feeless crypto like Nano, but then it still winds up centralized anyways to the richest investors. It just becomes another banking institution.. 
In the end it won’t necessarily be miners that are the ones profiting..
I’m hope I’m wrong though

People need to accept that at this pace, bitcoin is NOT going to achieve the adoption rate that the internet did.
Internet revolutionized communication is such a way that was so critical and convenient that it couldn’t be ignored.
Bitcoin is revolutionizing money; but the difference is people don’t see the capability of bitcoin in such a blatant (or convenient) way as compared to how internet was seen.
Internet never existed before; it was radically capable- money transfers already exist, bitcoin doesn’t necessarily make it anymore convenient or easier though.
I mean it does in change things radically certain ways... but it’s not on the same level on radicalism or importance as what was seen in the internet’s early days.
Communicating comes before money transferring; that’s why it was more radical and important.
Bitcoin will get there though, eventually.

I’m not going to be using bitcoin forever; and this L-BTC which makes me think of a derivative, kind of like what banks do; seems really ironic that the idea behind bitcoin allowing people to transact peer to peer without a third party has gone completely out the window, and now we are starting to see Payment hubs collecting fees (kind of like a bank)
There’s a difference between providing security and PoW to “mint” new coins vs. just providing a payment for ever-increasing fees.
I’m curious to see how far LN will come honestly nonetheless; just seems like steps in the wrong direction from someone who’s been observing bitcoin for years.

@_date: 2019-03-16 22:58:51
Exactly. 
I don’t see how it will ever be the case of one universal accepted currency when crypto enables a more diverse economy in the first place.
We have the potential to trade in a wide range of assets or “items of value” why should we take two steps back and say “no we want to force people into using only one currency so we can enforce our regulations and profit from you”
In this case, having more forms of exchange can help stimulate an economy without such a great risk of stagnation from transacting in one item of value that may not be very rewarding to spend. It diversifies an economy.
Time will tell.

Big transfers in and out of your account obviously raises red-flags for monitoring.
Use a decentralized exchange like Bisq and you’re probably good to go as an e-transfer isn’t necessarily linked to identity.
In the fucked-up event that you are audited, it’s just an e-transfer.

When money is generated, it’s essentially created from a Bank Note (or IOU) submitted to a bank account with an eternal balance of Zero dollars; WITH the promise of giving the money back PLUS interest. Money is created from this “note” with the promise that it will be given back to restore the balance and value in the economy (to keep it simple anyways)
It IS essentially an IOU, it IS essentially backed by nothing, and it IS essentially, not your money; EVER. It is an endless cycle of loaning that won’t stop until someone isn’t profiting from the generation of it, or until it’s paid back in something of value that isn’t actually loaned to you (like gold, although now that golds value is backed/estimated by the value of the fiat and not vice versa, even this won’t work, because the system itself is not sustainable.)
Gold was sound money because it couldn’t be created from an iou; now that the fiat isn’t backed by anything irreproducible, the system is actually broken, yet we use it because we are forced into it, because someone is profiting big time it.
Unless you graduated from any sort of economics class, I urge you to research how this happens in greater detail. 
It’s disgusting, it’s eternal debt, and it’s unsustainable (unless you want to raise the ceiling instead of clearing the shit out of the room, in which case it just means you will have to work harder, for a futile effort)
Every debt ceiling raise just  post-pones the inevitable collapse of a broken system, and they will never stop raising it, and they will work you until you die.

I second this. Bisq is an amazing idea that is worth involving yourself in.
E-transfers are encrypted, everyone is anonymous, you have your own private keys, it’s creating a DAO to manage the network. It’s honestly awesome.
It’s one flaw is that it lacks a rating system, so there is potential to trade with federal investigators. That needs a solution rather badly.
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:23:22

The whole premise of a 1 universal currency requires that it be directly regulated and controlled, ie. centralized. if you can’t directly regulate bitcoin or control it, it won’t work as the 1 universal currency for the world. 
Governments and bankers want direct control of the moneys supply, and that’s not something they are willing to give up on crypto either, hence why bitcoin will not work as single universal currency and neither will any-other decentralized crypto- crypto is therefore more effective at circumventing direct regulation from bankers who want to profit, and is better used to enable a free-market of value transferring, it works better for the people.
If you can’t understand how that works, I won’t explain it to you.

@_date: 2019-03-16 21:36:23
I think we need a better term than store of value.
The problem is that it’s more of a value generator at this point. Later on when bitcoin is older it theoretically should stabilize to a healthier point where spending it is equal of a reward than holding it.

Bitcoins problem is its UI. If I can’t just Tap my card, why would I bother. If these portable wallets had Tap or scan technology like a credit card, I could see the crypto work really taking off, but right now I see manipulation from the third parties that are interfering with the entire vision of Bitcoin - which is to give the money back in the people’s hands

In addition; after this next halving, bitcoins inflation rate will be 1.8%
That’s roughly the same rate as the USD.
The important difference is that inflation of fiat is endless; where-as with bitcoin, we already know it’s maximum possible supply, and we know inflation will stop eventually.
The next question to ponder is how the lack of “inflation” will affect the security of the network.

Satoshi openly spoke against wiki leaks using bitcoin at the time so seems odd if it were.
Edit: It seems my point may be confusing for some so I’ll clarify.
Satoshi loved the idea of Wikileaks using Bitcoin, but he did not approve of the context it was being used in (to escape financial sanctions) 
My argument is that it would be strange for Julian Assange to be Satoshi, as Satoshi explained he did not approve of the attention Wiki-leaks would be drawing to Bitcoin.

I mean you could say that, but if I’m not mistaken, they are going to get Schnorr signatures before Bitcoin, and I like how they actually have a road map.
I can’t find a roadmap for BTC.
In any case Bitcoin core is the original Bitcoin (here-after referred to as Bitcoin) and Bitcoin Cash is the immoral attempt to confuse and convert more people into buying the wrong Bitcoin.
Bitcoin cash has its uses I guess, but it’s still attempting to steal the spot-light, and if all works out with lightning, BCH will become irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:45:49
Talking about morals is pretty funny considering bitcoin is designed with incentivization (greed) in mind. Technically that would be an immoral design- but that’s okay because humans ARE immoral.
If we want a healthy space, we should take action instead of idly sitting by twirling our thumbs naively thinking that “if it’s truly bad it will disappear on its own”
Seriously, think about that phrase for a few moments and we should ask ourselves again if that will truly happen, because It’s the equivalent of sticking our heads in the sand.
Evil doesn’t exist because bad people do bad things, evil exists because good people let it happen. When were dealing with rich, powerful people, and flocks of technological ignoramus, it won’t just disappear... 
“The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict”
CW is attacking the bitcoin community, threatening people and supposedly trying to file patents for his own gain. This man is bad, we can’t sit by and do nothing! People need to take action!
Morality isn’t law, it’s upto is to decide what is and isn’t right, otherwise it WILL continue, saying otherwise is laughable (although it’s not)

Backlog of unvalidated transactions causes fees to rise because higher fees are the incentive to have your transaction validated as soon as possible.
LN will only solve this issue if the majority of on-chain transactions can be moved over to be processed off-chain, otherwise this will keep happening, and it will continue to be a turn off to impatient people (or people who want to use it as money, right now, rather than later)
LN is the effort to maintain the future decentralization of bitcoin, at the cost of higher fees and wait times in high transaction periods.

How could you not? If there is any reason to be suspicious of it, that’s the tell tale sign! 
Do you think any exchange (solvent or not) is going to post “we are freezing accounts because of PoK”? 
Of course they won’t, so obviously any links or connections which are only ever going to be indirectly related, to PoK and exchange solvency, should be judged with prying eyes- because any real judgement on this event will only be through observation and indirect connection. 
No exchange is going to admit “yes, we froze it because of PoK” and if they did, that would probably be a bad idea for them. Seems simple to me what the process of judgement should be then.

As well; Privacy coins will always exist so long as they fulfill their missions.
So really, with that being said, I do think there will be many crypto’s that will fulfill different niches in the future. It wouldn’t be reasonable to only pick one or two.

Similarly if we look at crypto as forms of speech, some of these “phrases” or ideas may end up being frowned upon, regulated, restricted, criminalized and even enforced.
It’s a good way to look at it, but even your speech is enforced and kept in check. Crypto is not an exception.

Nah, assassinations only happen to people who benefitted the common man.
Abraham Lincoln frees the slaves? Boom, dead. 
Martin Luther king empowered the black people? Boom, dead (this was proven to have been linked to the government also) 
JFK resented war, and denied operation northwoods, and wanted people to know about black-budget and shadow programs? Boom, dead.
It’s a pretty clear pattern to me; authoritarianism is worth killing for. Dictators don’t get assassinated; they are too beneficial to the systems of control.
Satoshi created bitcoin; if it was one person, and we did know who he was; I can guarantee he would wind up dead by “suicide” or “heart-attack”

This guy posted earlier; he thinks he knows, but he honestly doesn’t even have a clue on how a block-chain works, otherwise he would realize how naive he is.
His only possible arguement is bugs in bitcoins coding allowing abuse, but, again, the underlying blockchain technology allows for some semblance of self-correction. He’s technically correct in this arguement as no program can be bug free, but he’s wrong that it would destroy cryptocurrencies, as corrective actions can be taken and agreed upon through network consensus, essentially mitigating the effects of any flaws.
To this day, Bitcoin has not actually suffered from the effects of any flaws in the coding; and the more the network is tested, the stronger the network becomes.

That’s a tough one.
I guess about the only question I can think of asking is; how are traditional asset investing different from bitcoin?
Because essentially any asset can be a Ponzi scheme if invested through the wrong broker.
Bitcoin isn’t necessarily different in that regard, BUT, it is different in the fact that when you possess bitcoin, you can verify at anytime that it’s within your own wallet. Compared to traditional asset brokerages, you have to trust them with your assets, with bitcoin there is no third party trusting necessarily needing to be involved, you possess what you buy, and you can prove that at any time.
An asset is an asset, the difference with bitcoin is you own it; and that is about the only great argument you could prove, if they really cared to listen, which they won’t.
OR you can just say “Cryptography” and when he asks what does that mean, you tell him “If I have to explain it, you’ll never comprehend it” because ultimately he doesn’t want to learn, he just wants an arguement.

Good job on promoting awareness and adoption everyone, bravo!
Anyways, considering how much of a pain in the ass it is to use bitcoin for transactions, and considering nobody’s making it easier I’m gonna give you a tip.
Look into running your own lightning Node and accepting BTC payments through Lightning, OR, even easier, use a different, EASIER, crypto.
The one thing this sub does not accept, for the life of it, is that average retailers would want to use BTC as a payment method; everyone here expects you to know what your doing and that’s the biggest issue stopping adoption.

Bitcoin is valued in Satoshis. 
If the dollar were to collapse, bitcoins price would only go up, because people use financial assets as a hedge against loss of of fiat purchasing power.
It’s a global, near infinitely divisible honey badger; it don’t give a fuck. It’s value is not dependent on any one thing as localized as a “dollar” - it IS its own thing!
Like buddy said below, if the dollar collapses, does that suddenly mean hamburgers are going to stop happening? No, because it’s global, not local.

The idea is that large payments will happen on the base layer that will allow larger fees to be collected and given directly to miners to maintain the security of the network.
Lightning network (layer 2) would enable practically free transactions so we can pay for our coffee with BTC, asynchronously with the rest of the network, resulting in more free space in the bitcoin mempool/blockchain to be available for high value high fee transactions.

I really enjoy Exodus. Their support team rocks, and the wallet is pretty simple and intuitive. 
It’s my go to for the time being.

The fact that the new generations can even call block-grinding a game, speaks volumes. 
Older people don’t see the point, younger people couldn’t be bothered; we do live in the information era, but everyone is getting more uninformed by the day. 
As proponents of a revolution we have to be teachers, not judges.

Your argument sounds more like whining than anything.
It’s a globally obtainable limited supply asset, the hell you think is gonna happen?
Mass usage is the only thing that will reduce volatility; and this is still the Wild West baby.

Did a quick look-up for people
“The Kleiman circle of relatives filed a lawsuit in February 2018, discovering that the overdue David Kleiman, who died these days, had misplaced his Bitcoin inheritance because of allegedly dedicated acts of manipulation by way of Wright. Kleiman's property thinks David might have been one of the creators of Bitcoin, and naturally, Wright is already widely known for claiming to be Satoshi. In keeping with the felony workforce of Kleiman Property, the case have been initiated as a result of "Craig's theft, worth over $ 11 billion, in bitcoins and intellectual property on Dave Kleiman and W &amp; K's property shortly after Dave's death.” - some poorly written article.
It’s kind of a big deal if true. Craig will move bitcoins from some of the oldest addresses and say “Here I am! I AM Satoshi!” but we all know that he is not.

I’m pretty confused by your logic.
If bitcoin is propped up by tether (even though most of the volume is fake and washtraded) what difference does it make If tether shuts down, all that wash-traded volume is going to shift to another stable coin. That should imply that any fake prop-up on bitcoin by USDT will merely be replaced by fake prop-up from another stable coin.
I’d be worried about it only if people started cashing out, but that’s not likely as there are merely alternative stable coins that bitcoin can be supported through.
This seems like irrational FUD to me.
Think about it, I stopped using Tether and switched to USDC, I’m pretty confident if everyone else does that, it’s not going to affect bitcoins price much at all. Same volume, same effect.
The only scenario in which this would affect bitcoins price is if all exchanges suddenly valued USDT as 0:1, but I just don’t see that actually happening; and the majority of people would hopefully switch stable coins before then, otherwise the market price of bitcoin would drop, simply shaking out weak hands and carrying on its merry way.

Intelligence that can’t be grasped will always be labelled as delusion by the weak-minded. I’m not worried; it’s your loss.

��‍♂️ 
Do you realize that the numbers in your bank account aren’t real either? It’s only an obligation to you, from the bank, until you decide to withdraw the cash. 
Here, take the very next dialogue in that Wolf of Wall Street scene for example.
Mark Hanna: So if you got a client who brought stock at eight, and it now sits at sixteen, and he’s all fucking happy, he wants to cash it and liquidate and take his fucking money and run home. You don’t let him do that.
Jordan Belfort: Okay.
Mark Hanna: Cause that would make it real.
Jordan Belfort: Right.
The point I’m making is; it doesn’t have to be real, to make it a legitimate and legal obligation. Stock brokers maintain solvency by NOT reserving assets; but they are still legally obligated to your investment the moment you want your money back. It’s called a ledger, and that’s what stocks, real-estate, shares and hell, even a tradition bank account; a ledger with obligation but the difference with bitcoin is, once you possess your bitcoin, it IS really yours, the money you invested is always going to be redeemable and you don’t have to wait for the broker to move funds around and actually provide any real liquidity to you; it’s already liquid for you, and the money sits exactly where you invested it.
If you want to continue to conflate legitimacy with physical possession, at this point, you do you; because we both know that’s entirely irrelevant and always has been.

I can’t find the links anymore, but people were posting on cryptocurrency subs that displayed all the known bitcoin addresses confirmed to be possessed by Binance.
Basically it was an image of like 10 different bitcoin addresses that amounted to around 188,000 bitcoins reserved for the SAFU fund.
Basically, they have reserves of Bitcoin to replenish the hot wallet that was hacked; they don’t actually have to do anything with BNB, or even buy BTC to restore users funds. They will make up those lost BTC by fees gathered from trades on their exchange (essentially charging people for the safety of their money)
