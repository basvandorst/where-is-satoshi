Last I checked that can happen with the current retirement system. Let's go back 10 years to 2008. That is why so many people are still working. Trying to get that money back.

Thanks for this. I have been wondering which one to use on Android.

I thought you could move from Coinbase to GDAX (Coinbase owns them) and then to your personal wallet all for free?

That's awesome. I hope it works.

I tried slushpool but wasn't making much from it. I think I need to tweak my miner. I need to make sure it uses the CPU and GPU.

So this might be more of a ELI5 but why not hold onto all that money them when it stabilizes (if it ever does) won't it have value or will the value never recover?

In all fairness it's not just taxes you are born into with no say :)

Couldn't you just use it via coinbase and a shift card?  Then again coinbase reports to the IRS over a certain threshold.
