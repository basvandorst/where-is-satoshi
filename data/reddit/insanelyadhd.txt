Same thing with many things that the govt. doesn't like.  The idea here is not to cut out uncle sam, but rather to make the current situation better.
Either way, you are correct, this would have to be ok by the govt.

I agree with your point that we'd essentially be keeping everything on a central ledger.  However, I also believe that there is a benefit to having a distributed ledger that isn't centrally owned.  Currently, we have many 'central' ledgers with different financial institutions.  These in turn are reconciled by the us govt.  
This system is highly inefficient.  Furthermore, it forces us to rely on the internal regulations of several oligarchies...  and several layers at that.  
Additionally, I'm highly intrigued by the concept of smart money and smart contracts.  This might be an excellent area for innovation.
*I'm migrating this to thx for the heads up.

My thoughts exactly.  If (with the blessing of the powers that be of course)  an enterprising bank/govt were to issue a coin, then we'd have an interconnected coin.
While the USD is centrally regulated, it is not necessarily centrally held and controlled.  Currently, the US monitors banks who in-turn monitor their own funds.  From there, the US must guess things.  This leads to unnecessary expenses...  which ultimately trickles down to a currency that is unnecessarily expensive.
I've been been leaning towards the second approach.  While it requires trust in the bank, if the currency is design well enough, then we could potentially make it highly regulated-able if not entirely trustless.  
The bills could be tied to deposits, which are then kept in a very secure account of sorts.
If everything was structured correctly, then we might even make the bank community auditable...

Thanks for the tip!  I'll search there.

Neat.  This is exactly what I was thinking.
