Bitcoin is not comparable to PayPal into this way as PayPal uses USD, GBP etc the share price doesn't effect the PayPal user storing money in anyway.
Bitcoins price does effect the holder because the value of my bitcoin isn't tied to a currency my purchasing power fluctuates.

So the many dips and bumps of bitcoin doesn't effect you long term you won't always see the dip coming

I'm a strong supporter of bitcoin but I think all your analogy fall short.
Bitcoin can't really be compared to the internet as bitcoin has unlimited competition (litecoin, darkcoin etc). What communications network do you have access to even compare to the internet. 
Tl:Dr 
Bitcoin not comparable to internet

I'd recommend not sinking all your money in a once it would be better to invest say 2k a month over the next 2 years that way it will average out for any dips in the price

What does a fragile economy mean 
@_date: 2014-12-13 22:00:57
I think a crisis that limits back withdrawals or if a countries currency value depleted. 
But what were looking at now is a deflationary period as more and more companies accept bitcoin

You realize it is this attitude which causes the price to drop as must shops use bitpay which automatically converts it to usd .
I do agree that that doing as you say will increase adoption

@_date: 2014-03-20 15:13:08
Right now there is alot of mtgox 'dumped' bitcoin so their is a larger supply recently. I think price will drop to about 550 then jump up
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:51:50

We should produce a petition

There is nothing wrong with people accepting it. The problem is that places that currently accept arnt keeping them their selling them. This lowers the bitcoin price. If the retailers were keeping the bitcoin it would be a positive thing.

Bitcoin is harder to steal then most of your possessions. There is also ways you can prevent it from being stolen. Have a read into hardware wallets and paper wallets. 
The hacks that do take place generally make the price go down as the hackers like to convert to fiat asap

What will happen with Bitcoin? Fiat will go down, gold up, but Bitcoin, miners, exchanges,...
When stocks and trust in the market drop gold rises and most psychical assets do. But who knows maybe the crisis forces many people to sell their bitcoins which will stabilize the price. Fiat will just keep inflating the costs of things. I know for instance if my bank suddenly limited withdrawals I might be forced to sell mine
Bitcoin still needs to reach a lot more people before it would be a store of value. Bitcoin must be trusted which means it has to be stable or generally going up. 
 When reading about the impending financial crisis always question the time frame and compare to historical events. I do agree their is a crisis coming but I doubt it will take the form of most of the things we hear about. But undoubtedly in most of the people reading this life's the western world is going to change significantly. 
Most of the "disaster" will be avoided by higher tax rates in my country. The last debt crisis was avoided by simply taxing high salary earners as high as 90%  and the debt crisis was avoided. It also led to growth it our construction industry and financial industrys. As people invested in houses.
But the dollar is a whole other mess that impacts everyone everywhere.

Its January everyone is broke from Christmas so are selling their bitcoin
