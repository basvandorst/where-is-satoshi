So... are there people here, including yourself maybe, that did this? I think there must be, but I'd like confirmation. As far as I know BTC is on a huge rise, so there must be someone who bought years ago and sold for big gains?
Also, for the longest time price has been going up, that is true. Yet I don't understand what dictates the "value" of a BTC compared to a USD or Euro. So I don't understand why everybody seems sure it is going to continue growing and it is going to be accepted as value worldwide.


Yea the idea is great, but how can you be sure governments will allow this?

They appear to me as very volatile and very possible scams, and I'm trying to educate myself asking the next man what have they achieved using them.
I'm looking for someone clarifying my ignorance on the maths part (that has been answered) and for someone to tell me their experience with BTC.
I didn't hear about the 250B before, what I wonder is: does that apply to real money exchange? You think all bitcoin owners can go and exchange them for real money today and get even 1/100 of that amount?


I understand this. It applies to many things, art for example, or precious minerals. There can be difficulty finding someone to convert your thing into paper money tough.

I didn't spend years. Over the years, I have several time become interested in BTCs and other currencies and tried to understand them, failing.

No, and I didn't ask that. Any other pointless questions?

So... have many people done it? I sure would if I could.
What I want to understand is who / which group takes your BTCs and converts them to USD, transferring them on your bank account. I am very skeptical of this but I'm pretty sure I'm wrong considering the big boom of these currencies.

Yea man, I will maybe when I get the time, but I'd like a simple clear explanation as I think these things should be clear to you guys on this subreddit.
The first video on that channel is 30m and I swear I've seen several long videos that didn't solve my doubts.

This is the most helpful video I've seen so far, very well explained.

I asked a few simple question and the answer is "spend a few days or weeks here".
Is that helping myself?
No joke, I expected people like you would be in the pool in these kind of investments.

I am trying to learn what this is all about, but not from ignorant uneducated people such as yourself. 
Luckily other users are normal people.

Ok, so a person who has 100 BTCs right now could sell them and get hundreds of thousands of dollars?
